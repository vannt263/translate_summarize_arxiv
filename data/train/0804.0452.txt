    "one of the most challenging problems of strong interaction dynamics is to determine the composition of hadrons in terms of their fundamental qcd quark and gluon degrees of freedom . because of the strongly coupling nature of qcd in the infrared domain",
    ", it has been difficult to find analytic solutions for the wavefunctions of hadrons or to make precise predictions for hadronic properties outside of the perturbative regime .",
    "thus an important theoretical goal is to find an initial approximation to bound state problems in qcd which is analytically tractable and which can be systematically improved .",
    "recently the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite between string states in anti  de sitter ( ads ) space and conformal field theories ( cft ) in physical space - time , modified for color confinement , has led to a semiclassical model for strongly - coupled qcd which provides analytical insights into its inherently non - perturbative nature including hadronic spectra , decay constants , and wavefunctions .    as we have shown recently , there is a remarkable mapping between the ads description of hadrons and the hamiltonian formulation of qcd in physical space - time quantized on the light front .",
    "the light - front wavefunctions of bound states in qcd are relativistic and frame - independent generalizations of the familiar schrdinger wavefunctions of atomic physics , but they are determined at fixed light - cone time @xmath2the  front form \" advocated by dirac  @xcite  rather than at fixed ordinary time @xmath3 .",
    "the light - front wavefunctions of a hadron are independent of the momentum of the hadron , and they are thus boost invariant ; wigner transformations and melosh rotations are not required .",
    "the light - front formalism for gauge theories in light - cone gauge is particularly useful in that there are no ghosts , and one has a direct physical interpretation of orbital angular momentum .",
    "_ light - front holography _ is an important feature of ads / cft ; it allows string modes @xmath0 in the ads fifth dimension to be precisely mapped to the light - front wavefunctions of hadrons in physical space - time in terms of a specific light - front impact variable @xmath1 which measures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron .",
    "this mapping was originally obtained by matching the exact expression for electromagnetic current matrix elements in ads space with the corresponding exact expression for the current matrix element using light - front theory in physical space - time  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall show that one obtains the identical holographic mapping using the matrix elements of the energy - momentum tensor . to prove this new result",
    ", we will show that there exists a correspondence between the matrix elements of the energy - momentum tensor of the fundamental hadronic constituents in qcd with the transition amplitudes describing the interaction of string modes in anti - de sitter space with an external graviton field which propagates in the ads interior .    the ads / cft correspondence implies that a strongly - coupled gauge theory is equivalent to the propagation of weakly - coupled strings in a higher dimensional space , where physical quantities are computed in terms of an effective gravitational theory .",
    "thus , the ads / cft duality provides a gravity description in a ( @xmath4)-dimensional ads space - time in terms of a @xmath5-dimensional conformally - invariant quantum field theory at the ads asymptotic boundary  @xcite .    holographic duality requires one to consider a higher dimensional warped space with negative curvature and a four - dimensional boundary . in particular , the conformal isometries of the five - dimensional anti - de sitter space , a maximally symmetric space - time geometry with negative curvature , provides the basis for establishing a duality between a gravity or string theory on ads@xmath6 space and a conformal gauge theory defined at its four - dimensional space - time boundary . in its original formulation  @xcite",
    ", a correspondence was established between the supergravity approximation to type iib superstring theory on a curved background asymptotic to the product space of ads@xmath7  @xcite and the large @xmath8 , @xmath9 , supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) gauge theory in four dimensions with gauge group @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the group of conformal transformations @xmath11 which acts at the asymptotic boundary of ads space , acts also as the group of isometries of ads@xmath6 , and @xmath12 corresponds to the @xmath13 global symmetry which rotates the particles present in the sym supermultiplet .",
    "the supergravity duality requires a large ads radius @xmath14 corresponding to a large value of the t hooft parameter @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the string scale .",
    "the classical approximation corresponds to the stiff limit where the string tension @xmath18 , effectively suppressing string fluctuations .",
    "qcd is fundamentally different from sym theories where all the matter fields transform in adjoint multiplets of @xmath19 .",
    "qcd is also a confining theory in the infrared with a mass gap @xmath20 and a well - defined spectrum of color singlet states .",
    "conformal symmetry is broken in physical qcd by quantum effects and quark masses .",
    "there are indications however , both from theory and phenomenology , that the qcd coupling is slowly varying at small momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a new extraction of the effective strong coupling constant @xmath21 from cebaf large acceptance spectrometer collaboration ( clas ) spin structure function data using the bjorken sum @xmath22 in an extended @xmath23 region  @xcite , indicates the lack of @xmath23 dependence of @xmath24 in the low @xmath23 limit .",
    "one can understand this physically  @xcite : in a confining theory where gluons have an effective mass or maximal wavelength , all vacuum polarization corrections to the gluon self - energy decouple at long wavelength ; thus an infrared fixed point appears to be a natural consequence of confinement  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if one considers a semiclassical approximation to qcd with massless quarks and without particle creation or absorption , then the resulting @xmath25 function is zero , the coupling is constant , and the approximate theory is scale and conformal invariant  @xcite .",
    "one can use conformal symmetry as a _ template _ , systematically correcting for its nonzero @xmath25 function as well as higher - twist effects  @xcite .",
    "different values of the holographic variable @xmath26 determine the scale of the invariant separation between the partonic constituents .",
    "hard scattering processes occur in the small-@xmath26 ultraviolet ( uv ) region of ads space .",
    "in particular , the @xmath27 zero separation limit corresponds to the @xmath28 asymptotic boundary , where the qcd lagrangian is defined . in the large-@xmath26 infrared",
    "( ir ) region a cut - off is introduced to truncate the regime where the ads modes can propagate .",
    "the infrared cut - off breaks conformal invariance , allows the introduction of a scale and a spectrum of particle states . in the hard - wall model",
    "@xcite a cut - off is placed at a finite value @xmath29 and the spectrum of states is linear in the radial and angular momentum quantum numbers : @xmath30 . in the soft - wall model a smooth infrared cutoff is chosen to model confinement and reproduce the usual regge behavior @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the resulting models , although _ ad hoc _ , provide a simple semiclassical approximation to qcd which has both constituent counting rule behavior at short distances and confinement at large distances  @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural , as a useful first approximation , to use the isometries of ads to map the local interpolating operators at the uv boundary of ads space to the modes propagating inside ads .",
    "the short - distance behavior of a hadronic state is characterized by its twist ( dimension minus spin ) @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the sum over the constituent s spin @xmath34 .",
    "twist is also equal to the number of partons @xmath35 . under conformal transformations",
    "the interpolating operators transform according to their twist , and consequently the ads isometries map the twist scaling dimensions into the ads modes  @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of normalizable modes in ads give the hadronic spectrum .",
    "ads modes represent also the probability amplitude for the distribution of quarks and gluons at a given scale .",
    "there are also non - normalizable modes which are related to external currents : they propagate into the ads interior and couple to boundary qcd interpolating operators  @xcite . following this simplified ",
    "bottom up \" approach , a limited set of operators is introduced to construct phenomenological viable five - dimensional dual holographic models  @xcite .    in the top - down supergravity approach ,",
    "one introduces higher dimensional branes to the @xmath36 background  @xcite in order to have a theory of flavor .",
    "one can obtain models with massive quarks in the fundamental representation , compute the hadronic spectrum , and describe chiral symmetry breaking in the context of higher dimensional brane constructs  @xcite .",
    "however , a theory dual to qcd is unknown , and this  top - down \" approach is difficult to extend beyond theories exceedingly constrained by their symmetries .    an important feature of light - front quantization is the fact that it provides exact formulas for current matrix elements as a sum of bilinear forms which can be mapped into their ads / cft counterparts in the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the ads metric written in terms of light front coordinates @xmath37 is @xmath38 at fixed light - front time @xmath39 , the metric depends only on the transverse @xmath40 and the holographic variable @xmath26 .",
    "thus we can find an exact correspondence between the fifth - dimensional coordinate of anti - de sitter space @xmath26 and a specific impact variable @xmath1 in the light - front formalism .",
    "the new variable @xmath1 measures the separation of the constituents within the hadron in ordinary space - time .",
    "the amplitude @xmath0 describing the hadronic state in @xmath41 can then be precisely mapped to the light - front wavefunctions @xmath42 of hadrons in physical space - time  @xcite , thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons in qcd at the amplitude level .",
    "the correspondence of ads amplitudes to the qcd wavefunctions in light - front coordinates was carried out in  @xcite by comparing the expressions for the electromagnetic matrix elements in qcd and ads for any value of the momentum transfer @xmath43 .",
    "it is indeed remarkable that such a correspondence exists , since strings describe extended objects coupled to an electromagnetic field distributed in the ads interior , whereas qcd degrees of freedom are pointlike particles with individual local couplings to the electromagnetic current .",
    "however , as we have shown  @xcite , a precise mapping of ads modes to hadronic light - front wavefunctions can be found in the strongly - coupled semiclassical approximation to qcd .",
    "the matrix elements of local operators of hadronic composite systems , such as currents , angular momentum and the energy - momentum tensor , have exact lorentz invariant representations in the light front in terms of the overlap of light - front wave functions .",
    "one may ask , if the holographic mapping found in  @xcite for the electromagnetic current is specific to the charge distribution within a hadron or a general feature of light - front ads / qcd .",
    "the matrix elements of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath44 of each constituent define the gravitational form factor of a composite hadron . in this paper",
    "we shall use gravitational matrix elements to obtain the holographic mapping of the ads mode wavefunctions @xmath0 in ads space to the light - front wavefunctions @xmath45 in physical @xmath46 space - time defined at fixed light - cone time @xmath47 .",
    "we find the identical holographic mapping from @xmath48 as in the electromagnetic case .",

    "<S> light - front holography is a remarkable feature of the ads / cft correspondence between gravity in ads space and conformal field theories in physical space - time ; it allows string modes @xmath0 in the anti - de sitter ( ads ) fifth dimension to be precisely mapped to the light - front wavefunctions of hadrons in physical space - time in terms of a specific light - front impact variable @xmath1 which measures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping was originally obtained by matching the exact expression for electromagnetic current matrix elements in ads space with the corresponding exact expression for the current matrix element using light - front theory in physical space - time . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that one obtains the identical holographic mapping using matrix elements of the energy - momentum tensor . to prove this , we show that there exists a correspondence between the matrix elements of the energy - momentum tensor of the fundamental hadronic constituents in qcd with the transition amplitudes describing the interaction of string modes in ads space with an external graviton field which propagates in the ads interior . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement of the results for electromagnetic and gravitational hadronic transition amplitudes provides an important consistency test and verification of holographic mapping from ads to physical observables defined on the light - front . </S>"
