    "the study and census of our solar neighborhood is important to advance our understanding of low mass stars and brown dwarfs , which are the most numerous known objects in the galaxy . as such they shed light on the low - end of the initial mass function , and on star formation efficiency .",
    "the search for our nearest neighbors lets us study objects in great detail , because they are the closest , brightest objects of their class .",
    "the detailed study of late - type dwarfs , brown dwarfs , subdwarfs , and white dwarfs has historically relied on the identification of objects based on their optical through mid - infrared colors .",
    "these studies have been enhanced by recent surveys for high proper motion objects , because these surveys have no color bias , and can therefore identify objects with unusual characteristics not found through color - based searches .",
    "the object 2mass j06154357@xmath01247221 = wisea j061543.91@xmath0124726.8 , which we henceforth designate wisea 0615@xmath01247 , was originally discovered as a high proper motion star by lpine ( 2008 ) and designated by him as pm i06157@xmath01247 in a re - analysis of southern hemisphere digitized sky surveys .",

    "this proper motion is in rough agreement , within the errors , with the allwise motions .",
    "we carried out an additional estimate of the motion of the object , via a @xmath18 minimization fit to its positions in the first and second digitized sky surveys ( dss1 and dss2 ) red ( @xmath19-band ) plates , 2mass , _ wise _ all - sky , and _ wise _ 3-band cryo data releases . in this way we obtained @xmath17 = 447 @xmath4 5 and @xmath16 = @xmath0414 @xmath4 4 mas yr@xmath5 , as well as a parallax @xmath20 which is practically 0 due to the large errors listed in table 1",

    "reductions for dbsp observations made use of standard procedures for ccd data , described in kirkpatrick et al .",
    "reductions for the lris observation made use of a non - stardard procedure , because weather conditions prevented the observation of a flux calibrator on that night . instead , a flux calibrator ( the white dwarf hz 44 ) was measured on ut 2015 jul 17 , using a different instrument configuration than for the target .",
    "therefore we had to force the spectral shape of the lris data of the target at 8,59010,270   to match that of the dbsp 2014 oct 24 data , by fitting second order polynomials .",

    "2003 ) at the nasa infrared 3-meter telescope facility , on ut 2015 jan 18 .",
    "a low - resolution ( @xmath22 75120 ) spectrum covering the range 0.69 to 2.54 @xmath10 m was obtained using the prism mode .",
    "exposures were done in an abba nod pattern along the 15-arcsec slit ; the total integration time was 956 sec . in order to apply telluric corrections ,",
    "an a0 v star was observed , as close in airmass as possible to our target , although a 0.3 airmass difference was the best we could achieve .",
    "data reduction was done with the spextool package ( vacca , cushing , & rayner 2003 ; cushing , vacca , & rayner 2004 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the spex spectrum of wisea 0615@xmath01247 .",
    "wavelength regions of low atmospheric transmission ( less than about 60% ) are indicated with gray bands .",
    "these regions correspond to water vapor absorptions at 0.92 , 1.13 , 1.35 , and 1.85 @xmath10 m , as well as co@xmath2 absorptions near 1.6 , 2.0 , and 2.06 @xmath10 m ( rayner , cushing , & vacca 2009 ) .",
    "the spectrum exhibits two peaks at @xmath12 1.08 and 1.27 @xmath10 m , which are near , but not at , the positions of h paschen - series @xmath23 and @xmath24 lines , respectively .",
    "the feature at 1.08 @xmath10 m is likely due to telluric h@xmath25o , and in our experience is sometimes easier to see at the low spectral resolution of these data .",
    "the feature at 1.27 @xmath10 m is due to poor correction of a telluric o@xmath2 band .",
    "we searched the literature for optical imaging data of wisea 0615@xmath01247 .",
    "the purpose was to see if a background contaminant source may have been present in the beam during our optical spectroscopy of the object .",
    "the images examined were the @xmath26-band and @xmath19-band images in dss2 , and the @xmath27-band image in the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis , 3rd data release ) .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows these three images .",
    "overlaid in figure  [ fig4 ] are the positions of wisea 0615@xmath01247 , shown as green circles and numbered labels , at respectively the @xmath26-band ( 1983 ) , @xmath19-band ( 1993 ) , @xmath27-band ( 1999 ) , allwise ( 2010 ) , and our optical spectroscopy ( 2014 ) epochs .",
    "the latter were computed from the allwise position of the object , and our estimate of motion from the displacement between 2mass and allwise ( section  [ obs_proper_motion ] ) .",
    "the orange arrow overlaid on the @xmath19-band image shows the motion of wisea 0615@xmath01247 .",
    "the source just below the motion vector and to the right of the allwise position ( number 4 ) is a neighboring denis catalog non - moving source .",
    "this denis source was 4 or 5 arcsec from wisea 0615@xmath01247 during our spectroscopic observations , and hence did not contaminate our spectrum since our slit width was 1.0 arcsec .",
    "no other sources with strong @xmath26- or @xmath19-band flux are seen in the field of our object at earlier epochs , hence we conclude that there is no contamination of our spectrum by a background source .",
    "there were no x - ray measurements of this object in the _ rosat _ all sky survey , or uv measurements in _ galex _ , or radio measurements in the vla faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ( first ) survey .",
    "our repeated optical spectra of wisea 0615@xmath01247 measured throughout 2014 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) do not show statistically significant evidence of variability .",
    "the spectral slopes are very comparable among the various observations ( although the lris 2014 oct 20 spectrum was modified , as described in section  [ optical_spectra ] ) .      in order to compare our spectra of wisea 0615@xmath01247 with those of m dwarfs , we first combined our optical and near - infrared data into a single spectrum .",
    "we used our ut 2014 oct 24 dbsp spectrum which has the best signal - to - noise , and normalized our spex spectrum to it at 7,916  .",
    "we then trimmed the two spectra into contiguous but non - overlapping ranges ( 4,0338,764   for dbsp , and 8,78324,950   for spex ) , taking into account that the optical red portion of the spex spectrum had better signal - to - noise than the dbsp one .",
    "the combined dbsp and spex spectrum is shown replicated in black in figure  [ fig5 ] , and is compared with spectra of m5 through m9 dwarfs from the spex prism spectral libraries ( burgasser 2014 ) , shown in red in figure  [ fig5 ] .    at wavelengths @xmath28 7000  , figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig5 ] show that an m7 dwarf is the best overall fit to our spectrum , among the mid- to late - m dwarfs considered , but with a deficit of flux at 9,000   to 1.3 @xmath10 m .",
    "our spectrum exhibits numerous atomic and molecular features ( ca i , ca ii , tio , and vo ) indicating an m dwarf of solar metallicity ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the spectrum also exhibits moderate h@xmath29 and h@xmath24 emission lines .",
    "the former ( h@xmath29 ) , absorption features of vo ( 7,300  ) and tio ( 8,850  ) , and an absorption line of ca i ( 8,500  ) suggest a late - m dwarf classification ( kirkpatrick 2009 ) .",
    "the near - infrared spectrum ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) shows pronounced absorption bands of h@xmath2o , wider than telluric ones , at 1.361.57 and 1.722.1 @xmath10 m , also indicative of a late m dwarf classification ( kirkpatrick 2009 ) .    in the blue optical , 4,0007,200  , the spectral slopes of the m7 dwarf shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , or m dwarfs shown in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    ", do not fit the spectral slope of our object .",
    "there is a prominent na d absorption line at 5,900   in our object , that is not comparable in its intensity and width to that in m or l dwarfs .",
    "an early l - type dwarf spectrum would exhibit na d absorption , although broader and of very different morphology than in our object .",
    "it would also exhibit features not seen in the spectrum of our object , most notably a prominent absorption feature from a k i doublet at 7,750  , or absorption features from mgh ( 5,200  ) and caoh ( 5,500  ) , among others ( kirkpatrick 2009 ) ; see figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the red optical spectra of wisea 0615@xmath01247 and an m7 dwarf are very different from those of late ( m)-type subdwarfs ( sdm ) , extreme subdwarfs ( esdm ) , and ultra subdwarfs ( usdm ) . the 7,800 - 8,100   spectral slope of an sdm89 is more smoothly monotonic in comparison with an m7 dwarf ( kirkpatrick et al .  2016 ; see their figures 62 and 39 ) .",
    "the corresponding slope of an esdm88.5 or a usdm8.59 is much bluer than for an m7 dwarf ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2016 ; see their figures 71 and 74 ) .",
    "those same figures show that the 8,5009,250   spectral region is very red in an m7 dwarf , while it is modestly red or flat in an sdm89 , and turns over blue with increasing wavelength in an esdm88.5 , or usdm8.59 ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "the spectra of sdm89 , esdm88.5 , or usdm8.59 exhibit a very dramatic pseudo - continuum bump or cah absorption trough at 6,800  , in contrast to a barely noticeable feature in an m7 dwarf ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2016 ) , owing to tio bands that swamp the cah trough in the latter .",
    "therefore a late - type sdm , esdm , or usdm can not reproduce the red optical spectrum of wisea 0615@xmath01247 while a solar metallicity m7 dwarf does .      in this section",
    "we explore the possibility that an unresolved binary fits the data best .",
    "the binary would be comprised of an object responsible for the blue optical portion of the spectrum , while a late - m dwarf is largely responsible for the red optical and near - infrared portions .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of a possible binary companion to a late - m dwarf can be assessed by subtracting a spectrum of the latter , from that of wisea 0615@xmath01247 .",
    "our goals for the difference spectrum were for it to be positive in the optical , except in telluric regions , and to eliminate the cah and tio spectral features at 6,7507,050  , under the assumption that they are produced only by the late - m dwarf .",
    "the one parameter that we varied was the normalization factor of the late - m dwarf spectrum at a fixed wavelength , which then determined the corresponding normalization factor of the binary companion spectrum .",
    "we chose 7,400   as the normalization wavelength , because it is not in a telluric region , and both the spectrum of our object and a late - m dwarf are relatively featureless thereat . after experimenting with various normalization factors",
    ", we chose to normalize the late - m dwarf spectrum to 55% of the flux of our object at the above wavelength . figure  [ fig7 ] shows the subtraction of the m7 dwarf spectrum in figure  [ fig2 ] , from our object s dbsp optical spectrum of 2014 oct 24 .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows that the cah and tio features were not eliminated , but our choice of normalization minimized their intensity . for normalization factors below 55% ,",
    "the above cah and tio features were more prominent , and for normalization factors above 55% , negative fluxes resulted in various wavelength regions apart from telluric ones .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows that the spectrum of a possible companion to a late - m dwarf linearly rises from 4,000 to 6,700  , except that it exhibits a broad absorption feature of na i d at 5,900  .",
    "the spectrum then precipitously drops from @xmath12 6,700 to 7,600  .",
    "it is very roughly flat from @xmath12 7,700 to 8,800  , and finally rises in the remaining reddest part of it .    the difference spectrum in figure  [ fig7 ] , and particularly the excess in the optical blue ,",
    "is plausibly produced by an object hotter than an m dwarf , and of relatively small radius , for its flux to be of the same order of magnitude as the m dwarf .",
    "therefore we considered a cool white dwarf as a possibility .",
    "cool white dwarfs are those with temperatures @xmath30 4,500 k. they are sometimes uncovered in proper motion surveys ( scholz et al .  2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "their infrared flux densities are depressed due to collision - induced absorption ( cia ) by h@xmath2 ( saumon et al .",
    "1994 ; hansen 1998 ; abel et al .",
    "we considered cia mainly from h@xmath2-h@xmath2 pairs , such as in the models by abel et al .",
    "however , depending on the relative abundance of he , cia from h@xmath2-he pairs may also be significant , as in models by borysow et al .",
    "the effect of cia is most evident at wavelengths @xmath28 1 @xmath10 m .",
    "however , oppenheimer et al .  ( 2001 ) noted that the optical colors of cool white dwarfs are also affected by cia .",

    "2006 ) , show that their seds are bluer and depressed relative to those of blackbodies .",
    "these models show that the onset of cia in the optical is gradual , and its exact starting wavelength is difficult to quantify .    a cool white dwarf , as a companion to an m7 dwarf",
