    "percolation is perhaps one of the most studied problems in statistical physics .",
    "this is not only because of the simplicity of its definition but also because of the versatility of its applications . to study",
    "percolation one needs to choose a skeleton first .",
    "it can be a lattice or a graph that has two entities namely sites ( nodes ) and bonds ( edges ) .",
    "we then occupy each site or bond , depending on whether we want to study site or bond percolation , with probability @xmath8 independent of the state of its neighbors @xcite .",
    "broadbent and hammersley in 1957 first presented the percolation model to understand the motion of gas molecules through the maze of pores in carbon granules filling a gas mask @xcite . since then the intuitive idea of percolation has been found relevant to so many seemingly disperate systems that its concept has literally percolated across a vast area of science and social science .",
    "examples include flow of fluid in porous media , infiltration in composite materials processing , spread of fluids , rumours , opinion , biological and computer viruses are just a few to mention @xcite .",
    "besides the simplicity of its definition and the versatility of its application there exists yet another reason why percolation model is so popular . in percolation",
    "we primarily observe how clusters , set of contiguous occupied sites , are formed and grown as a function of @xmath8 which is the only control parameter . as @xmath8 value increases from negligibly small , there appears for the first time a cluster that spans across the entire system . in the case of infinite system size",
    ", we find a unique threshold value @xmath0 such that there is the probability that the spanning cluster @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , such transition , despite being geometric in nature , yet we find many of its aspects reminiscent of continuous thermal phase transition ( ctpt ) @xcite .",
    "thus , percolation serves as a relatively tractable model for the investigation of phase transition and critical phenomena that lie at the heart of the modern development of statistical physics .",
    "this is perhaps the most important reason why percolation is still studied extensively even after almost 60 years of its inception .",
    "indeed , for almost every observable quantities in percolation there exist an equivalent counterpart in ctpt .",
    "these observables like their counterpart in ctpt , exhibit power - law , at least near @xmath0 , which is typically attributed to critical phenomena .",
    "for instance , the system size @xmath13 is like correlation length @xmath14 , mean cluster size @xmath15 is like susceptibility @xmath16 , percolation strength @xmath17 is like order parameter @xmath18 etc . like thermal phase transition",
    ", percolation transition too can be classified in terms of @xmath0 and by a set of critical exponents @xmath19 etc .",
    "one of the extraordinary findings in percolation is that the numerical value of its critical exponents depend neither on the detailed nature of the lattice structure nor on the type of percolation , bond or site .",
    "their values depend only on the dimension of the embedding space of the lattice .",
    "it is , therefore , said that percolation on all planar lattices belong to the same universality class .",
    "unique universality class has been found true for a variety of periodic and non - periodic planar lattices having fixed and mixed - valued coordination number , random planar lattices and their dual , random multifractal lattices etc .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite , which is the most recent review article ) .",
    "yet , have we exhausted all the possible lattices to conclude that percolation on all planar lattices belongs to the same universality class ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "recently , we have reported that the site percolation on a weighted planar stochastic lattice ( wpsl ) belongs to separate and distinct universality class @xcite .",
    "the wpsl is quite non - trivial as it has mixed properties of both lattice and network or graph @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "unlike networks it is embedded in the space of dimension @xmath20 , on the other unlike regular lattice , its coordination number distribution obeys a power - law .",
    "we found that the critical exponents for site percolation on the wpsl are totally different from the known values for all other planar lattices studied till to - date .",
    "we , therefore , claim that the random site percolation on the wpsl belong to a separate and distinct universality class .    in this article , we investigate the bond percolation on the wpsl and present detailed results of its site counterpart in order to see the contrast .",
    "one of the goals of the present article is to check if the bond and site percolation on wpsl belong to the same universality class like for all known planar lattices studied to date .",
    "first , we find the percolation threshold @xmath0 , for both bond and site percolation , using the idea of spanning probability @xmath21 .",
    "second , we attempt to find an estimate for the various critical exponents such as @xmath22 and @xmath23 using the finite - size scaling hypothesis where precise value of @xmath0 is necessary .",
    "then , we use the idea of data collapse for further fine tuning of the estimated values for the exponents till we get the best data - collapse .",
    "besides critical exponents , we also find the exponent @xmath24 that characterizes the cluster size distribution function @xmath4 and the fractal dimension @xmath7 that characterizes the mass of the spanning cluster @xmath25 .",
    "note that the values of the various critical exponents and the exponents @xmath24 , @xmath7 etc . are not at all independent rather they are bound by some scaling relations .",
    "we use these scaling relations for self - consistency check .",
    "we find that our estimate for various exponents satisfy these relations up to quite a good extent .",
    "our results based on extensive monte carlo simulation suggest that both site and bond percolation on wpsl belong to the same universality class and it is different from the one where percolation on all the planar lattices belong .    the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the algorithm for the construction of wpsl and some of its key features . in section iii , we briefly discuss the newman - ziff algorithm as it is the most efficient algorithm for percolation .",
    "we also discuss the finite - size scaling and underline its deep connection to the buckingham @xmath26-theorem in section iv . in section",
    "v , we present our results about bond and site percolation on the wpsl side by side so that we can appreciate the contrast .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section vi .",
    "we first give a brief description of the construction process of the wpsl .",
    "it starts with an initiator which we choose to be a square of unit area .",
    "the generator is then defined as the one that divides the initiator ( in step one ) randomly into four smaller blocks . in step two and thereafter the generator is applied to only one of the blocks by picking it preferentially with respect to their areas .",
    "consider the @xmath27th time step of the generation of the wpsl at which the system has @xmath28 number of blocks available whose areas are say @xmath29 .",
    "to pick one from @xmath28 blocks we subdivide an interval of unit length @xmath30 $ ] into @xmath31 sub - intervals of size @xmath32 $ ] , @xmath33$],@xmath34 , @xmath35 $ ] so that the higher the area the greater the size of the sub - intervals .",
    "we then generate a random number , say @xmath36 , from the interval @xmath30 $ ] and find which of the @xmath31 sub - intervals contain this @xmath36 and pick that block .",
    "this process ensures that the blocks are being picked preferentially according to their size . in fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) we give a snapshot of the lattice to give a visual impression of how it actually looks at any given time .",
    "it is a space - filling planar cellular structure where the size or the area of the cells in the lattice are not equal rather their distribution is random .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to many of the cellular structures that we are familiar with .",
    "one advantage of creating wpsl by random sequential partitioning of the square into ever smaller mutually exclusive rectangular blocks helps defining each step of the division process as one time unit .",
    "the number of blocks @xmath37 at time @xmath27 therefore is @xmath38 and hence it grows albeit the sum of the areas of all the blocks is always equal to the size of the initiator .",
    "thus , the number of blocks @xmath37 increases with time at the expense of the size of the blocks .",
    "recently , we have shown that the area size distribution of the blocks of wpsl obey dynamic scaling @xmath39 where we found @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "it implies that the snapshots of the lattice at different times are similar .",
    "yet another interesting properties of this lattice is that the dynamics of the system is governed by infinitely many conservation laws one of which is the conservation of total area . to be more precise ,",
    "if we denote @xmath42 and @xmath43 as the length and width of the @xmath44th block then we can show analytically that @xmath45 assumes statistically a constant value regardless of the time @xmath27 when the snapshot is taken @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that , except the conservation of total area , each of the infinitely conserved quantity is a multifractal measure .",
    "that is , we can assume that the @xmath44th block of the lattice is populated with probability @xmath46 .",
    "we have shown that within the multifractal formalism we can construct the partition function which is the @xmath47th moment of @xmath48 i.e. , @xmath49 measuring @xmath50 as a function of the square root of the mean block area @xmath51 one can show that @xmath50 exhibits power - law @xmath52 with exponent @xmath53 one of the characteristic features of this exponent is that it is non - linear @xmath54 except @xmath55 .",
    "note that the exponent @xmath56 has two interesting properties .",
    "first , @xmath57 @xmath54 at @xmath58 which is the dimension of the embedding space of the wpsl .",
    "second , @xmath59 @xmath54 at @xmath60 as it is required by the normalization condition @xcite .",
    "the legendre transform of @xmath56 is a method whereby its derivative @xmath61 can be considered as an independent variable instead of @xmath47 itself . in general , if we denote @xmath62 as the slope and @xmath63 as the intercept then the equation for the straight line is @xmath64 the function @xmath65 is the legendre transform of the function @xmath66 which is always concave in character .",
    "it implies that for every @xmath67 value there exist a spectrum of spatially intertwined fractal dimensions @xmath68 which are needed to characterize the wpsl except for @xmath55 .",
    "note that the maximum of @xmath69 occurs at @xmath58 which corresponds to the dimension of the embedding space of the wpsl when blocks are assumed empty .",
    "we thus find that the wpsl is a multi - multifractal planar lattice .    besides , wpsl is a planar cellular structure whose cells or blocks has coordination number disorder in the sense that unlike regular lattice it has great many different number of neighbors .",
    "in fact , its coordination number distribution exhibits a power - law @xcite .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the coordination number distribution in the voronoi diagram where it is also random but its distribution is peaked around the mean @xcite . in the voronoi diagram it is almost impossible to find cells or blocks which have significantly higher or fewer neighbours than the mean coordination number .",
    "that is , here the mean describes the characteristic scale .",
    "such characteristic scale is absent in the wpsl since the distribution function follows a power - law .",
    "the power - law coordination number distribution also means that the majority of the blocks in the wpsl are very poor in coordination number and there are few cells or blocks which have significantly high number of nearest neighbours .",
    "a lattice , so rich in properties can be of great interest as it can mimic disordered medium on which one can study problems like percolation or random walk . in brief , the wpsl has the following properties :    1 .",
    "its area size distribution function obeys dynamic scaling .",
    "2 .   it obeys infinitely many conservation laws .",
    "it is a multi - multifractal .",
    "4 .   its coordination number distribution function obeys power - law .",
    "in the standard algorithms , such as the hoshen - kopelman ( hk ) , one must create an entire new state for every given value of occupation probability @xmath8 in every independent realization .",
    "investigation of the various observable using such traditional algorithms are highly expensive in terms of computational time and accuracy of finding various observable quantities . in 2000 , newman and ziff ( nz ) proposed an algorithm which is highly efficient in both accounts @xcite .",
    "the efficiency in the nz algorithm lies in the fact that one creates a new state with @xmath70 occupied sites or bonds from the immediate previous state with @xmath67 occupied sites or bonds simply by occupying one extra randomly chosen site or bond .",
    "it is based on the intuitive idea of random sequential adsorption of sites or bonds on a given lattice or graph .",
    "the algorithm is trivially simple .",
    "one starts with an empty lattice",
    ". then at each step an empty site or bond is chosen at random and then is occupied if empty ; else the attempt is discarded . however , in order to further reduce the computation time we first decide an order in which the sites or bonds will be occupied .",
    "that is , we wish to choose a random permutation of the bonds or sites .",
    "this is done by creating a list of all the bonds in any convenient order .",
    "positions in this list are numbered from @xmath71 .",
    "choose a number @xmath72 at random with uniform probability in the range @xmath73 .",
    "then use any standard textbook algorithm to randomize the number @xmath74 to @xmath75 and put them in a new order in which they will be occupied . having chosen an order of all the sites , we start occupying them in that order . the first site or bond to be occupied will definitely form a cluster of size one .",
    "the second , third , fourth etc too are highly likely to form clusters of size one",
    ". however , the likelihood of forming clusters of size one will decrease with the number of occupied sites since some sites when occupied , will become contiguous occupied sites thus making clusters of size more than one .",
    "the formation of clusters and the statistics of their sizes are the key to the study of percolation theory . in the case of nz algorithm",
    "we measure an observable , say @xmath76 , for fixed numbers of occupied sites ( or bonds ) , and obtain a data for @xmath77 as a function of occupation number @xmath67 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the hk algorithm where the number of sites being occupied at a given @xmath8 is random and different at every independent realization .",
    "however , if the system size is large enough then the mean occupation number will almost equal to @xmath78 where @xmath37 represents the system size .",
    "the weight factor of obtaining different @xmath67 for a given @xmath8 are not the same .",
    "the exact weighting factor of there being exactly @xmath67 occupied sites on the lattice for a given @xmath8 is given by binomial distribution @xmath79 the binomial coefficient @xmath80 represents the number of possible configurations of @xmath67 occupied sites and @xmath81 empty sites .",
    "using this and the data for the observable @xmath76 for all values of @xmath67 we can find @xmath76 for any value of @xmath8 by the following relation @xmath82 it is interesting to note that the ensemble of states with exactly @xmath67 occupied sites or bonds obtained according to nz algorithm can referred to as a _",
    "microcanonical percolation ensemble _ , where the number @xmath67 is the equivalent counterpart of the energy @xmath83 in thermal statistical mechanics . on the other hand ,",
    "if we keep @xmath8 fixed instead of @xmath67 we can regard it as the canonical ensemble .",
    "we offer here a brief introduction to the spirit and scope of the scaling approach to phase transitions and critical phenomena in general .",
    "it is well - known as finite - size scaling ( fss ) hypothesis .",
    "it has been extensively used as a very powerful tool for estimating finite size effects near the threshold value of the controlling parameter . in the continuous phase transition , the various response functions , typically the second derivative of the free - energy , diverges .",
    "such transitions are classified by a set of critical exponents .",
    "the best known example of continuous phase transition is the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition where it has has been found that @xmath84 in percolation , their equivalent counterparts are @xmath85 these relations are only true in the thermodynamic limit in the sense that the system size is infinite .",
    "it is important to appreciate the fact that we can neither do experiment nor simulation on infinite systems where the correlation length @xmath86 . to overcome this impediment ,",
    "physicists have come up with a smart solution which is known as finite - size scaling . in general , an observable quantity , say @xmath87 , of the threshold phenomena that exhibit continuous phase transition is said to obey finite - size scaling if it satisfies @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are said to be critical exponents .",
    "it provides an elegant way of extrapolating critical exponents for infinite system from a set of data for finite systems using the idea of data collapse .",
    "we shall here show that the origin of the fss theory is actually deeply rooted to the buckingham @xmath26-theorem as it can be systematically obtained following the prescription of that theorem @xcite .",
    "consider that a quantity @xmath87 is the primary quantity of interest which depends on the control parameter @xmath91 and the system size @xmath13 so that we can write @xmath92 note that in the case of threshold phenomena , where there is a critical or threshold value @xmath93 across which the system under goes a sudden or abrupt change , we find that the distance @xmath94 is a better variable than @xmath91 itself . indeed , the observable quantity @xmath87 is found to depend on @xmath94 and hence we write @xmath95 we almost always find that the quantity @xmath94 diminishes with @xmath13 following a power - law @xmath96 .",
    "it implies that we can choose one of the parameters , say @xmath13 , to have an independent dimension .",
    "thus the dimension of @xmath87 too can be expressed in terms of @xmath13 alone @xmath97 following the argument of the @xmath26-theorem we can now define two dimensionless quantities @xmath98 and @xmath99 note that @xmath100 being a dimensionless quantity its numerical value must remain invariant , for a given value of @xmath101 , even if we change @xmath13 by an arbitrary factor and hence @xmath102 .",
    "we can thus immediately write that @xmath103 the reduction of initially two variable problem into one variable problem constitutes the basic statement of the buckingham @xmath26-theorem .",
    "this is traditionally known as an hypothesis in the literature namely as the finite - size scaling hypothesis .    a quantitative way of interpreting how the experimental data exhibit finite - size scaling is done by invoking the idea of the data - collapse method - an idea that goes back to the original observation of rushbrooke @xcite .",
    "the plots of @xmath104 vs @xmath91 for different @xmath13 always result in distinct curves .",
    "however , the same data can be made to collapse on a single universal curve if one plot @xmath105 vs @xmath106 instead of @xmath104 vs @xmath91 regardless of the size of @xmath13 .",
    "the quality of data collapse depends on how exact the value of @xmath93 and the exponents @xmath89 and @xmath107 .",
    "data - collapse means that the characteristic properties of the system represented by @xmath87 are similar on different system size @xmath13 .",
    "note that two systems of different sizes are said to be similar if they differ in the numerical value of their dimensional quantities @xmath87 and @xmath91 , however , the numerical value of the corresponding dimensionless quantities @xmath105 and @xmath106 coincide and that is why we obtain data - collapse . obtaining data - collapse guarantees that the system exhibits scaling or similarity with respect to different independent system size .",
    "it is an extension of the idea of similarity of two triangles .",
    "for instance , two right triangles ( characterized by their area @xmath15 and the sides @xmath108 and the hypotenuse @xmath109 ) may differ in the numerical value of their dimensional quantities .",
    "now , one can vary @xmath107 keeping @xmath89 fixed and measure @xmath15 for both the triangles . plotting @xmath15 as a function of @xmath107 will definitely give two distinct curves one for each . however , the plots of the corresponding dimensionless quantities @xmath110 vs @xmath111 will give rise to single universal curve since the numerical value of @xmath110 will always coincide for a given value of the acute angle @xmath112 regardless of the size of the triangle .",
    "this happens because triangles are similar .",
    "what is site and bond in wpsl ? before answering this question we find it worth discussing first what they are in the context of conventional lattices .",
    "for instance , we can regard a square lattice as a grid or mesh .",
    "each cell of the grid has four sides and each side is a common border of two cells only . in the case of square grid",
    ", we can thus regard each cell as a site since it contains exactly one lattice point .",
    "equivalently , we could also regard the vertices of each cell as sites .",
    "however , in the present context we stick to the former definition . the dual of the square grid , obtained by replacing the center of each cell by a node and the common border between neighbouring cells by a link connecting the two nodes .",
    "we can thus regard the links of the dual as the bond of the square lattice .",
    "following the same argument we regard the blocks of the wpsl as its sites not the vertices of the lines that tessellated the initiator . to define bond ,",
    "we first find its dual .",
    "it is obtained by replacing the center of each block by a node and the common border between two neighbouring blocks by a link connecting the corresponding nodes .",
    "we regard these links as the bonds of the wpsl . using these ideas we first performed site and bond percolation on the square lattice and reproduced all the known results and then we applied them to the wpsl .",
    "recently , we have studied site percolation on wpsl , and found non - trivial results .",
    "that is , it belongs to a separate universality class than the universality class where percolation on all planar lattices are believed to belong .",
    "however , we are yet to check whether the site and bond percolation on wpsl belong to the same class or not . the dual of the wpsl can be well described as complex network and we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the corresponding degree distribution follow a power - law @xmath113 with exponent @xmath114 .",
    "interestingly , the degree distribution @xmath115 in the context of network is the same as the coordination number distribution in the context of lattice .",
    "however , there is a sharp difference between networks based on graph theory and the network obtained from the dual of a lattice which is embedded in a space .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that networks based on graph theory have no edge or surface but networks based on the dual of a lattice have edge or surface which is crucial in the case of percolation as it is useful in defining the spanning cluster .    in the case of bond percolation ,",
    "the lattice consists initially of @xmath37 blocks and hence the system has exactly @xmath37 number of cluster of size one since the center of each block represents a site .",
    "thereafter , each time we occupy a bond , a cluster at least of size two or more is formed . in the case of site percolation ,",
    "each time we occupy a block , the size of the cluster may vary as we measure it by the area of contiguous occupied blocks .",
    "initially all the blocks are empty and we wo nt know the size of the cluster even after the first block is occupied . for regular lattice like square lattice of @xmath116 sites",
    "have @xmath117 and @xmath118 bonds with open and periodic boundary condition respectively . now in the case of wpsl , being a disordered lattice , we can not have such exact relation .",
    "we still find that the number of bonds or sites when we take average over ensemble of independent realizations follow a relation valid for all size of the lattice .",
    "for instance , for the lattice at time @xmath27 there are exactly @xmath119 sites and on the average there are @xmath120 bonds with periodic boundary condition .",
    "thus the mean coordination number is equal to @xmath121 which is higher than the square lattice .",
    "we know that the percolation threshold @xmath0 depends on coordination number of the lattice and the higher the mean coordination number of a lattice the lesser is the value of @xmath0 . in the case of for square lattice , for instance , each site has exactly four nearest neighbours and each bond has six and hence @xmath0 of site percolation is higher than that of the bond . in the case of wpsl , we find that the mean number of nearest neighbors of a bond is @xmath122 which is almost double the mean nearest neighbour of a site .",
    "so , it is expected that the @xmath0 value for bond percolation in wpsl will be quite less than @xmath123 for the site percolation @xcite .",
    "percolation is all about formation of clusters and the statistics of their various properties as a function of control parameter @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "the typical observable quantities in percolation are ( i ) spanning probability @xmath21 , ( ii ) percolation probability or percolation strength @xmath17 , ( iii ) the mean cluster size @xmath15 , ( iv ) cluster size distribution function @xmath124 etc and their variation with @xmath8 or @xmath13 .",
    "the spanning probability @xmath21 for both bond and site describes the likelihood of finding a cluster that spans across the system either horizontally or vertically at the occupation probability @xmath8 . to find how @xmath21 behaves with the control parameter @xmath8",
    "we perform many , say @xmath75 , independent realizations under the same identical conditions . in each realization for a given finite system size we take record of the @xmath0 value at which the spanning cluster appears for the first time .",
    "to find a regularity or a pattern among all the @xmath75 numbers of @xmath0 values recorded , one usually looks at the relative frequency of occurrence within a class or width @xmath125 . to find @xmath21 ,",
    "we can process the data containing @xmath75 number of @xmath0 values to plot histogram displaying normalized relative frequency as a function of class of width @xmath125 chosen as per convenience . in figs . ( [ fig:2a ] ) and ( [ fig:2b ] ) we show a set of plots of @xmath21 for bond and site percolation respectively as a function of @xmath8 where distinct curves are for different system size @xmath126 .",
    "one of the significant features of such plots is that they all meet at one particular @xmath8 value regardless of the value of @xmath13 .",
    "it means that even if we had data for infinite system the resulting plot would still meet at the same point revealing that it must have a special significance and the significance is that it is the threshold probability @xmath0 .",
    "note that finding the @xmath0 value for different lattice is one of the central problems in percolation theory . in the case of bond",
    "we find @xmath127 which is exceedingly less than its site counterpart since on the average nearest neighbor that each bond has in the wpsl is much higher than for its site counterpart .",
    "the second most significant feature of the @xmath21 vs @xmath8 plot is the direction of shift of the curve on either side of @xmath0 as the system size @xmath13 increases .",
    "this shift with @xmath13 clearly reveals that all the data points , i.e. the @xmath8 values , are marching towards @xmath0 .",
    "we can quantify the extent at which they are marching by measuring the magnitude of the difference @xmath128 for different @xmath13 .",
    "that is , we can draw a horizontal line at a given value of @xmath129 , preferably at the position where this difference is the most , and take records of the difference @xmath130 as a function of system size @xmath13 . plotting the resulting data after taking log of both the variables or in the logarithmic scale",
    "we find a straight line whose slope gives an estimate of the inverse of @xmath131 since fig .",
    "( [ fig:2c ] ) suggests @xmath132 it implies that in the limit @xmath133 all the @xmath8 takes the value @xmath0 revealing that @xmath21 will ultimately become a step function so that @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp1 ] ) to define a dimensionless quantity @xmath134 .",
    "now , we plot @xmath21 vs @xmath134 in fig .",
    "( [ fig:2d ] ) and we see that all the distinct plots @xmath21 vs @xmath8 for bond percolation collapse onto a one universal curve and for site onto another curve albeit they share the same @xmath90 value . by tuning the @xmath135 value",
    "further we can get an excellent data - collapse for @xmath136 and hence a better @xmath137 value that corresponds to infinite lattice size .",
    "consider that we pick a site at random and ask : how likely is that site belong to the spanning cluster ?",
    "for finite system size , it may not belong to the spanning cluster even if @xmath8 is larger than the percolation threshold @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we therefore can quantify the strength of the spanning cluster by percolation probability @xmath17 which describes how likely a site picked at random is to belong to the spanning cluster .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is defined as the ratio of the size of the spanning cluster @xmath138 to the size of the lattice @xmath37 i.e. , @xmath139 sometimes , percolation probability is also defined as the probability that an occupied site belongs to the spanning cluster .",
    "it can be obtained if we replace the denominator @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pp1 ] ) by total occupied sites .",
    "we , however , will consider the former definition .",
    "there exists yet another definition where we can use the size of the largest cluster instead of the spanning cluster .",
    "note that all of these definitions behaves in the same fashion like order parameter .",
    "that is , in the limit @xmath133 , @xmath140 for @xmath10 and it rises from @xmath140 at @xmath0 to @xmath141 continuously and monotonically like @xmath18 .",
    "such behavior is reminiscent of order parameter like magnetization @xmath142 in the case of paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition and hence @xmath17 is regarded as the order parameter in percolation theory .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath143 value is known to depend only on the dimension of the lattice and independent of the type of percolation . through the site percolation on wpsl",
    "we already reported that @xmath143 value for wpsl , which is a planar lattice , is different from the value for all the known lattices whose dimension of the embedding space @xmath20 .",
    "we shall now check if the @xmath143 value for the bond percolation is the same as for the site percolation .",
    "it is important to note that in the case of site percolation we occupy its blocks or cells which are of different size .",
    "we therefore measure the area of the spanning cluster , not the number of blocks in the spanning cluster .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the regular lattice where all the blocks or cells are of the same size and hence the size of the spanning clusters can be described by the number of blocks or sites in the spanning cluster . in the case of bond percolation on wpsl",
    "we , however , use the traditional definition of cluster size .",
    "this is one significant difference between bond and site percolation on wpsl .",
    "note that for bond percolation on wpsl we use the dual of the wpsl not the lattice itself .",
    "the dual of the wpsl is obtained by replacing each block of the wpsl by a node or vertex at its center and each common border between blocks by a bond connecting the nodes at the center of corresponding blocks . in the case of bond percolation",
    "we occupy these links and measure the size of the cluster by the number of nodes or vertices that the cluster contains .",
    "below we shall see the impact of this difference in their behavior , if at all .",
    "( [ fig:3a ] ) and ( [ fig:3b ] ) we plot percolation probability @xmath17 as a function of @xmath8 for bond and site respectively .",
    "looking at the plots , one may think that all the plots for different @xmath13 meet at a single unique point like it does for @xmath21 vs @xmath8 plot .",
    "however , if one zoom in it becomes apparant it is not so and hence the @xmath0 value from this plot will not be as satisfactory as it is from @xmath21 vs @xmath8 plot .",
    "we also find that @xmath144 is not strictly equal to zero at @xmath145 , rather there is always a non - zero chance of finding a spanning cluster even at @xmath145 as long as the system size @xmath13 is finite .",
    "however , the plots of @xmath17 vs @xmath8 for different system size @xmath13 reveals that the chances of getting spanning cluster at @xmath145 diminishes with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "there is also a lateral shift of @xmath17 value to the left for @xmath12 but the extent of this shift @xmath146 decreases to such an extent that it never diminishes . on the other hand , the extent of shift @xmath146 to the right for @xmath145 diminishes to zero following eq ( [ eq : sp1 ] ) .",
    "we shall now check if @xmath17 above @xmath0 grows like @xmath18 .",
    "if it does so then we shall find the value of the critical exponent @xmath143 and compare it with that of its site counterpart .    to show that the percolation probability behaves like @xmath18 and to find the exponent @xmath143 for infinite system size @xmath13 we use the idea of finite - size scaling .",
    "we first plot @xmath144 vs @xmath147 and find that unlike @xmath21 vs @xmath147 it does not collapse .",
    "instead , we find that for a given value of @xmath148 the @xmath17 value decreases with lattice size @xmath13 . it means percolation probability is not a dimensionless quantity and hence assume that @xmath149 and we choose @xmath150 for later convenience . to find the value of @xmath151 we measure the heights at a given value of @xmath148 for different @xmath13 and plot them in the log - log scale .",
    "we find straight lines for both bond and site ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig:3c ] ) ) with slopes @xmath152 for bond and @xmath153 for site revealing that they are almost parallel .",
    "it implies that if we now plot @xmath154 vs @xmath148 all the distinct plots of @xmath17 vs @xmath8 should collapse into a single universal curve . in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3d ] ) we plot just that and find an excellent data - collapse using @xmath155 for both bond and site .",
    "we checked it for square lattice anyway .",
    "this again implies that percolation probability @xmath17 exhibits finite - size scaling @xmath156 note that although the critical exponents of both site and bond coincide their collapsed universal curve does not .",
    "we have chacked it with the site and bond percolation on square lattice and found that there too the universal curve do not coincide .",
    "hsu and huang also stated that the universal curves are different for planar random lattice , dual of the planar random latice and of the square lattice albeit they belong to the same universality class @xcite . now using eq .",

    "( [ eq : pp3 ] ) to eliminate @xmath13 in favor of @xmath146 we get @xmath157 where @xmath158 independent of site or bond percolation and it is significantly different from the corresponding values for all known planar lattices .",
    "the cluster size distribution function @xmath124 plays a central role in the description of percolation theory .",
    "it is defined as the number of clusters of size @xmath159 per site in the lattice .",
    "unfortunately , only in the case of one dimensional system , we know an exact form for the cluster number @xmath124 and manage to it handle approximately for infinite system which is actually the bethe lattice .",
    "for @xmath160 we do not yet know an exact expression for @xmath161 .",
    "this is because in such cases there exists a large number of different ways in which clusters of same size can arrange themselves , which are called lattice animals . even for relatively small cluster size in the square lattice",
    "we run into difficulties in enumerating them .",
    "nevertheless , theoretically we can still write down the general expression @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the number of possible lattice configurations of size @xmath159 and perimeter of size @xmath27 .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath164 is the probability that an arbitrary site belongs to a cluster of size @xmath159 . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantity @xmath165 is the probability that an arbitrary site belongs to a cluster of any size which is in fact equal to @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the two @xmath166 is the probability that an occupied site chosen at random belong to a cluster of size exactly equal to @xmath159 .",
    "the mean cluster size @xmath167 therefore is given by @xmath168 where the sum is over the finite clusters only i.e. , the spanning cluster is excluded from the enumeration of @xmath15 .",
    "the definition of mean cluster size @xmath15 , however , does not have information about the geometric structure of the clusters like their compactness and spatial extent .",
    "it is important to mention that the mean area of the blocks in the wpsl decreases as @xmath169 and hence increasing the size of the lattice we need to blow up the lattice by a factor of @xmath170 .",
    "it compensates the decreasing block size with increasing block number @xmath37 . that is , the mean cluster size @xmath171 in the case of wpsl . in the case of bond percolation , however , we do not need to multiply by the factor @xmath170 as the cluster size here is measured by the number of nodes or vertices it contains not by the area .    in figs .",
    "( [ fig:4a ] ) and ( [ fig:4b ] ) we show the plots of the mean cluster size @xmath167 , for both bond and site percolation , as a function of @xmath8 for different lattice sizes @xmath13 .",
    "we observe that in either cases , there are two main effects as we increase the lattice size .",
    "first , we see that the mean cluster size increases as we increase the occupation probability till @xmath8 approaches to @xmath0 and the peak height grows profoundly with @xmath13 in the vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "second , there is a slight shift in the peak towards @xmath0 value as we increase @xmath13 . the extent of shift is again given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp1 ] ) . to bring the peak height to meet at the same point we first plot @xmath15 as a function of dimensionless quantity @xmath172 .",
    "we then measure the peak height for a fixed value of @xmath172 but for different @xmath13 . plotting these peak heights as a function of @xmath13 in the @xmath173-@xmath173 scale give straight lines for site and bond percolation both ( see the inset of fig .",
    "( [ fig:4c ] ) .",
    "it implies that @xmath174 where like before we again choose @xmath175 for future convenience and find that @xmath176 for bond and @xmath177 for site .",
    "the two values are so close that they can be well approximated to be the same .",
    "plotting now the same data of figs ( [ fig:4a ] ) and ( [ fig:4b ] ) by measuring the mean cluster size @xmath15 in unit of @xmath178 and @xmath179 in unit of @xmath180 respectively we find that all the distinct plots of @xmath15 vs @xmath8 collapse superbly into one universal curve ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig:4d ] ) ) in both cases with the same value for the corresponding exponents @xmath181 .",
    "it again implies that the mean cluster size too , for both bond and site , exhibits finite - size scaling @xmath182 sharing the same critical exponents . eliminating @xmath13 from eq .",

    "( [ eq : nsp3 ] ) diverges .",

    "( [ fig : nsp ] ) we plot @xmath201 vs @xmath159 , for both site and bond , in the log - log scale and find two parallel lines except near the tail where there is a hump due to finite size effect .",
    "however , we also observe that as the lattice size @xmath13 increases the extent up to which we get a straight line increases too .",
    "it implies that if the size @xmath13 were infinitely large , we would have a perfect straight line obeying eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "the slopes of the lines are @xmath202 for bond and @xmath203 for site .",

    "let @xmath206 denote the mass or size of the percolating cluster of lattice of linear size @xmath13 .",
    "if the percolating cluster grows as a compact object , then its mass @xmath206 would grow with @xmath13 as @xmath207 since the dimension of the embedding space of the wpsl is @xmath20 .",
    "however , at @xmath0 if we would like to walk through the spanning cluster then the amount of time it would take must diverge as @xmath133 .",
    "this is so because of the fact that percolating cluster at @xmath0 is highly ramified .",
    "in fact , if we had @xmath208 that would surely be @xmath207 . at @xmath0",
    "we also get the same mass - length relation but the exponent is less than @xmath209 . to understand the significance of it , let us stack objects of unit sized squares as shown in fig .",

    "we make four copies of the resulting object after step one .",
    "we stack two of them side by side like step one and the other two on top of them again side by side . in general in the step @xmath44 we make four copies of the resulting object after step @xmath210 .",

    "now , let us slightly change the situation .",

    "( [ fig:5b ] ) .",
    "the amount of mass of the resulting system in the @xmath44th step is @xmath213 and the linear size of the system is @xmath214 . using this two relations we can eliminate @xmath44 in favor of @xmath13 and we find the same mass - length relation as in eq .",

    "( [ fig:5b ] ) as it has holes of many different sizes .",
    "now , a litmus test whether the spanning cluster is a fractal or not would be to check if it obeys the same mass - length relation with an exponent @xmath217 since the embedding space of the spanning cluster is a plane .",
    "we plot the size of the spanning cluster @xmath75 as a function of lattice size @xmath13 in the log - log scale as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fractal ] ) .",
    "indeed , we find that @xmath218 for site and @xmath219 which are almost the same but significantly different from the one for regular planar lattices @xmath220 .",
    "it may appear that the difference between the @xmath7 for wpsl and that for regular planar lattices is not much but it important to remember that even a small difference in fractal dimension has an huge impact in their degree of ramification .",
    "we already know that the mean cluster size diverges i.e. , @xmath221 as @xmath192 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsp3 ] ) , @xmath15 can only diverge if its numerator diverges . generally , we know that @xmath222 converges if @xmath223 and diverges if @xmath224 . applying it into both numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsp3 ] ) at @xmath0 gives a bound that @xmath225 .",
    "( [ eq : nsp8 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsp3 ] ) and taking continuum limit gives @xmath226 we know that @xmath227 diverges like @xmath228 where @xmath229 and hence comparing it with eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsp7 ] ) we get @xmath230 besides , there is another well known scaling relation @xmath231 which we can use to find @xmath24 value . using the @xmath7 value for wpsl in the scaling relations , @xmath232 and @xmath231",
    ", we find @xmath24 equal to @xmath233 and @xmath234 respectively which is almost equal to the one we obtained straight from slope of fig .",
    "( [ fig : fractal ] ) .",
    "there are also a couple of other well - known scaling relations , such as @xmath235 , @xmath236 , which we used for a consistency check of our results . to this end",
    ", we find that our estimates satisfy these relations up to quite a good extent .",
    ".the critical and other characteristic exponents for site and bond percolation in the wpsl and in the regular planar lattice are given alongside . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this article , we have studied both bond and site percolation on wpsl using extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "we thought it is important to know some key features of the wpsl so that one can understand why it is so special and unique .",
    "we therefore have first briefly discussed its construction process and then its various properties which are as follows .",
    "( i ) the dynamics of its growth is governed by infinitely many conservation laws .",
    "( ii ) its area size distribution function obeys dynamic scaling .",
    "( iii ) each of the infinitely many conservation laws , except conservation of total area , gives rise to multifractal spectrum and hence wpsl is a multi - multifractal .",
    "fourth , its coordination number distribution function follows a power - law .",
    "( iv ) it has a mixture of properties of both lattice and graph . on one hand , like lattice",
    ", it is embedded in a space of dimension @xmath212 ; on the other its coordination number distribution follow power - law like network .",
    "these unique properties have resulted in unique results too .",
    "we also briefly discussed about the finite - size scaling theory and have shown that its origin is deeply rooted to the buckingham @xmath26-theorem .",
    "the finite - size scaling is one of the most crucial aspects in percolation as it helps extrapolating critical exponents for infinite system using data for a set of finite size systems .",
    "this is done by using the idea of data collapse .",
    "note that an excellent data collapse is one of the clear testaments that the numerical values we obtained for various exponents are quite satisfactory .",
    "besides , we show that these satisfy a set of scaling relations which also provide a consistecy check .    in this work we first obtained percolation threshold @xmath127 and @xmath123 for bond and site percolation on wpsl . naturally , the @xmath0 for bond is less than that of its site counterpart as expected .",
    "we also obtained numerically the various observable quantities such as the spanning probability @xmath21 , the percolation strength @xmath144 , the mean cluster size @xmath167 etc . using nz algorithm .",
    "the initial data obtained from the nz algorithm correspond to microcanonical ensemble . to get the corresponding data that correspond to canonical ensemble we used the convolution equation given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : convolution ] ) for each observable quantities . with the help of a comprehensive finite - size scaling theory we also obtained numerically the critical exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 for both bond and site percolation on wpsl and confirm they are equal ( see table [ table:1 ] for detailed comparison ) . to check further if they are equal or not we used the idea of data collapse and found an excellent data collapse for the same critical exponents albeit different @xmath0 . note that good estimate of @xmath0 and of the critical exponents a must for obtaining satisfactory data collapse .",
    "these values also satisfy the scaling relations .",
    "all these provide a clear testament that the critical exponents for bond and site percolation in wpsl are the same .",
    "it happens in spite of the significant difference in the definition of clusters .",
    "interestingly , these values are significantly different from the ones for all known planar lattices .",
    "we can thus conclude that the universality class of wpsl ( bond and site ) is distinct from the ones for all the known planar lattices .",
    "it happens in spite of the significant differences in the definition of site and bond in the wpsl .",
    "hsu and huang also studied percolation in a class of random planar lattices and their duals yet they found the same critical exponents as the ones for regular lattices .",
    "_ studied percolation on multifractal planar lattices and they too found the same critical exponents as the ones on regular lattices .",
    "so , it is neither the randomness nature of the lattice nor the multifractal nature of the lattice can be held responsible for making wpsl unique . the planar random lattice that hsu and huang studied is quite different than wpsl .",
    "the coordination number distribution of their lattice do not obey power - law .",
    "this is perhaps one of the most significant differences .",
    "or , it may be the case that when a lattice is multifractal and at the same time it is random then depending on further detailed nature may be responsible for giving a new set of exponents",
    ". however , it is too soon to draw any conclusion .",
    "we hope to device more variants of wpsl in our future endeavour and see what happens .",
    "nevertheless , we still hope that our findings will have a significant impact in the percolation theory .",
