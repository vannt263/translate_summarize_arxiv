    "a characteristic feature of the @xmath0 decay process is the quantum mechanical tunneling  @xcite through the so - called coulomb wall generated by the electrostatic interaction of the @xmath0 particle with the constituent protons of the daughter nucleus .",
    "bremsstrahlung in @xmath0 decay is intriguing because of the classically incomprehensible character of radiation emission during the tunneling process .",
    "considerable attention has therefore been devoted to both experimental  @xcite as well as theoretical investigations  @xcite , with the aim of elucidating the role of tunneling during the emission process .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize , however , that the term `` radiation during the tunneling process '' has a restricted meaning as the wavelength of the photon is much larger than the width of the tunneling region and even larger than the main classical acceleration region .",
    "it is therefore not possible to identify the region where the photon was emitted . besides",
    ", it is possible to write the matrix element of bremsstrahlung in different forms using operator identities . as a result , the integrands for the matrix element , as well as the relative contributions of the regions of integration , will be different depending on the operator identities used , although the total answer remains , of course , the same .",

    "the effective charge prefactor for the quadrupole contribution is large . the dipole - quadrupole interference term vanishes after angular averaging ,",

    "then we use the quasiclassical approximation for the radial part of the wave functions ( see , e.g. ,   48 , 49 of ref .",
    "the matrix elements with the quasiclassical radial wave functions have been calculated using methods described in detail in ref .",
    "although these methods are in principle well known , we present here some details of the calculation .",
    "let us consider first the contribution @xmath207 of the classically allowed region to the matrix element @xmath208 using the standard quasiclassical wave function and assuming @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath209 where @xmath210 and the second expression is obtained after an integration by parts . according to @xcite ,",
    "the classically forbidden part can be incorporated by shifting the integration contour for @xmath211 into the complex plane , via the replacement @xmath212 . as a result",
    "we arrive at @xmath213 similarly , the leading in @xmath144 contribution to the quadrupole amplitude is determined by the integral [ see the second term in square brackets in eq .",

    "( [ mn ] ) , @xmath215 we find that this term is suppressed by a factor @xmath144 . however",
    ", while @xmath216 vanishes in the limit of a small photon energy @xmath217 , the contribution @xmath218 tends to a nonzero constant at @xmath219 , i.e. , even though @xmath218 is parametrically suppressed by a factor @xmath220 , it constitutes the dominant contribution to the dipole - quadrupole interference term at very small photon energies , due to its distinctive asymptotic behaviour .",
    "a precise calculation of the @xmath218 contribution to the interference term is unfortunately hampered by the fact that the region of integration around @xmath61 gives an important contribution to the value of @xmath218 due to the inverse power of @xmath221 in the integrand , which thus makes the value of @xmath218 nuclear model - dependent . in the data analysis of our recent experiment  @xcite ,",
    "we therefore did not include the parametrically suppressed term @xmath218 . while good overall agreement between experiment and theory was obtained in this way ( see fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the agreement is better at photon energies @xmath222 as compared to photon energies below this region . as the region of small @xmath2 coincides with the region where the @xmath218 term might contribute to the dipole - quadrupole interference term",
