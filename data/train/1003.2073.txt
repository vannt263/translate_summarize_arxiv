    "in recent years supersymmetric theories have aroused increasing interest in elementary particle physics .",
    "the supersymmetric extension of the standard model with @xmath0 supercharge is considered to be an interesting candidate for a quantum field theory with phenomenological relevance in the near future .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is an essential ingredient also for other models beyond the standard model .",
    "the @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the @xmath6 gauge theory describing self - interactions of gauge fields @xmath7 , corresponding to the _ gluons _ ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the supersymmetric partners of the gluons are described by spin-1/2 majorana fermion fields @xmath9 , the _ gluinos _ ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "compatibility of susy with gauge invariance requires that the gluinos transform in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "this theory describes the interactions between gluons and gluinos .",
    "the lagrangian of euclidean sym theory in the continuum , including a susy breaking mass term , reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the gauge covariant derivative in the adjoint representation .",
    "the gluino mass term introduces a soft breaking of supersymmetry",
    ".    in the low - energy regime the interactions become strong .",
    "arguments based on the low - energy effective lagrangian approach @xcite predict the occurrence of non - perturbative dynamics like confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in susy gauge theories .",
    "confinement is realised by colourless bound states .",
    "since both gluons and gluinos transform according to the adjoint representation , bound states can be built by any number of at least two gluons and gluinos . in the case",
    "where the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sym - lag ] ) is switched off ( @xmath13 ) , an anomalous global chiral symmetry @xmath14 is present .",
    "this symmetry is equivalent to the @xmath15-symmetry in supersymmetric models .",
    "the anomaly does not break the global chiral symmetry completely and a discrete subgroup @xmath16 remains . as in the case of qcd , the discrete chiral symmetry is expected to be spontaneously broken to @xmath17 by the non - vanishing value of the gluino condensate @xmath18 .",
    "the consequence of this spontaneous breaking is the existence of @xmath19 degenerate ground states with different orientations of the gluino condensate .",
    "sym is also equivalent to qcd with a single quark flavour ( @xmath20 qcd ) in the limit of a large number of colours ( @xmath21 ) , where the majorana spinor is replaced by a single dirac spinor in the antisymmetric representation of the gauge group @xcite .",
    "the latter model is also object of investigation by our collaboration @xcite .",
    "since confinement occurs in low - energy sym , standard analytical methods like perturbation theory fail and non - perturbative methods are required .",
    "this motivates the introduction of the lattice formulation of sym .",
    "the first lattice formulation of sym suitable for numerical simulations has been proposed by curci and veneziano @xcite .",
    "it it based on the wilson discretisation , which proved to be successful in lattice qcd computations in spite of its known limitations .",
    "first non - perturbative investigations of sym on the lattice using this formulation have been performed by @xcite in the quenched approximation , and by the desy - mnster - roma collaboration with dynamical fermions ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review , and references @xcite .",
    "susy is broken explicitly by the lattice discretisation .",
    "additionally , in the wilson approach the mass term and the wilson - term break both chirality and susy explicitly .",
    "both symmetries are expected to be recovered in the continuum limit by tuning the relevant bare mass term to its critical value corresponding to a massless gluino ( @xmath13 ) , and the gauge coupling towards zero .    in recent years , simulations of @xmath0 sym on the lattice using ginsparg - wilson fermions with good chiral properties , such as domain wall fermions ,",
    "have been initiated @xcite . for large lattice volumes and small lattice spacings",
    "these formulations require , however , a significantly larger amount of computing resources than the wilson formulation . the gain of no need for tuning the position of the zero gluino mass point does not compensate by far the advantage of wilson fermions .    in the past",
    ", investigations of the gluino dynamics have been performed using the two - step multi bosonic ( tsmb ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm was developed in the framework of the desy - mnster collaboration .",
    "recently , the two - step polynomial hybrid monte carlo ( ts - phmc ) algorithm @xcite has been developed and implemented for sym .",
    "this algorithm offers more efficiency and improvements compared to the tsmb algorithm and allows us to collect higher statistics and to simulate small gluino masses @xmath22 in this study .",
    "furthermore , due to available computer resources we simulated the theory on volumes with extension larger than 2 fm , which is expected to be the minimally required volume for spectroscopic studies .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to continue the project of the desy - mnster collaboration for the simulation of @xmath0 @xmath23 sym .",
    "we present new accurate results obtained with the newly used ts - phmc algorithm and improved actions .",
    "the most important characteristics of the theory is the mass spectrum of bound states , for which the low - energy effective theories predict a reorganisation of the masses in two massive wess - zumino supermultiplets at the susy point @xcite , where the soft breaking vanishes .",
    "the introduction of a small gluino mass removes the mass degeneracy between the supermultiplet members . in the lower supermultiplet",
    "the ordering of the states with increasing mass is : scalar glueball @xmath24 , spin-1/2 gluino - glueball ( @xmath25 ) , pseudoscalar glueball @xmath26 .",
    "the ordering is reversed in the higher supermultiplet which contains : adjoint pseudoscalar meson @xmath27-@xmath28 , spin-1/2 gluino - glueball ( @xmath29 ) , adjoint scalar meson @xmath27-@xmath30 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in the next section we review the lattice formulation and describe the simulation details .",
    "section  [ sec : confinement ] is devoted to the static quark potential and the determination of the scale .",
    "methods for the determination of the masses of bound states are described in section  [ sec : masses ] . in section  [ sec : spectrum ]",
    "the results on the spectrum are collected and discussed .",
    "finally , we conclude our findings in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the curci - veneziano action of @xmath0 @xmath23 sym theory on a lattice , @xmath31 , contains the usual plaquette gauge field action @xmath32 , and a fermionic action @xmath33 for the gluino .",
    "the gauge action @xmath32 can be extended to a more general form which includes , besides the usual @xmath34 wilson loop plaquette term , @xmath35 wilson loops of perimeter six .",
    "we employ the _ tree - level improved symanzik _ ( tlsym ) gauge action , given for @xmath36 colour group by @xmath37 with the normalisation condition @xmath38 .",
    "the bare gauge coupling @xmath39 is related to the lattice parameter @xmath40 by the usual relation @xmath41 . for the tlsym action we have @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the gluinos are represented by majorana fermions @xmath43 in the adjoint representation .",
    "they satisfy the majorana condition @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the charge conjugation matrix in the spinorial representation .    in the gluino sector ,",
    "the wilson formulation for fermions proposed in @xcite introduces the wilson term proportional to @xmath46 , which is an irrelevant term in the continuum limit .",
    "we set the wilson parameter to @xmath47 .",
    "the fermion part @xmath33 of the action is then given by @xmath48 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the bare hopping parameter which encodes the bare gluino mass @xmath50 .",
    "the real orthogonal matrices @xmath51 are the gauge links in the adjoint representation : @xmath52^{ab }   \\equiv 2 { \\mbox{tr}}[u_{\\mu}^{\\dag}(x ) t^a u_{\\mu}(x ) t^b ]   = [ v_\\mu^*(x)]^{ab } = [ v_{\\mu}^{-1}(x)]^{ba}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 are the generators of su(@xmath54 ) satisfying @xmath55 . in case of su(2 )",
    "one has @xmath56 with the pauli matrices @xmath57 .",
    "the links @xmath58 in the fermion action can be replaced by _ stout_-smeared links @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that short range topological defects of the gauge field and the corresponding small eigenvalues of the fermion matrix are removed .",
    "both the tlsym gauge action and the stout smeared links in the fermionic part of the lattice action are introduced in order to accelerate the approach to the continuum limit as @xmath59 .",
    "the stout smeared links are defined by @xmath60 here @xmath58 denotes the original `` thin '' gauge links , and @xmath61 with the sum of `` staples '' @xmath62 @xmath63 is an arbitrary parameter which we fix in this work to @xmath64 . in principle",
    ", the smearing defined by the above equations can be iterated several times , but then the fermion action becomes extended over a larger region on the lattice .",
    "we prefer to keep the action well localised and hence only perform a single smearing step .    writing the gluino action as",
    "@xmath65 @xmath66 is the non - hermitian fermion matrix or lattice wilson - dirac operator for dirac fermions in the adjoint representation . using relation ( [ eq : majorana - condition ] )",
    ", the fermion action can be rewritten in terms of the antisymmetric matrix @xmath67 .",
    "integration of the fermionic variables yields the pfaffian of @xmath68 , @xmath69 whose absolute value equals the square root of the fermion determinant : @xmath70 effectively , this corresponds to a flavour number @xmath71 . in the wilson setup ,",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 are always real and positive , but the pfaffian @xmath74 can become negative even for positive gluino masses .    in our numerical simulations",
    "we include the dynamics of the gluino by the two - step polynomial hybrid monte carlo ( ts - phmc ) @xcite algorithm with flavour number @xmath71 .",
    "this has the consequence that only the absolute value of the pfaffian is taken into account in the updating of the gauge field configuration .",
    "the sign of the pfaffian has to be included in a reweighting step when calculating expectation values .",
    "it can be shown that the sign of the pfaffian is equal to the sign of the product of half of the doubly degenerate negative real eigenvalues of @xmath66 . for positive gluino masses",
    "sufficiently far away from zero , a negative sign of the pfaffian rarely occurs in the updating sequence and therefore in this situation a sign problem does not show up . approaching the limit of vanishing gluino mass",
    "we monitor the sign of the pfaffian and take it into account by reweighting .",
    "it turned out that only in our runs @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( see table [ tab : setup ] below ) a noticeable number of configurations with negative sign occured ; the highest fraction being in point @xmath76 , where they amount to 3% of all configurations . the effect of the negative signs on the particle masses turned out to be negligible .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath0 sym on the lattice are the lattice gauge coupling @xmath40 and the fermionic hopping parameter @xmath49 .",
    "similarly to qcd , the mass term proportional to @xmath77 breaks chirality explicitly . in the present case it also breaks the supersymmetry .",
    "a massless gluino , @xmath13 , is obtained by tuning the bare mass term to its critical value ( @xmath78 ) or equivalently @xmath79 .",
    "._algorithmic parameters for ts - phmc runs with tlsym gauge action at @xmath2 . runs labelled with subscript @xmath80 have been performed with stout - links .",
    "@xmath81 is the number of configurations produced , @xmath82 is the sommer scale parameter , @xmath83 is the adjoint pion mass in lattice units , and @xmath84 is the dimensionless quantity @xmath85 used to estimate the gluino mass . in @xmath84",
    "the values of @xmath86 extrapolated to @xmath87 have been used . _ [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,>,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the gluino - glueball @xmath88 with a mass of about 1386 mev turns out to be considerably heavier than the @xmath27-@xmath28 with a mass of 670 mev .",
    "furthermore , the masses of the scalar glueball and the scalar meson @xmath27-@xmath30 are near the mass of the pseudoscalar @xmath27-@xmath28 .",
    "the behaviour of scalars is compatible with mixing between @xmath89 glueball and @xmath27-@xmath30 .",
    "the pattern of scalar masses suggests a lower supermultiplet , while the spin-1/2 candidate remains heavier up to the smallest simulated gluino mass in this simulation , and also after extrapolation to @xmath90 . whether this outcome is a discretisation artefact or a physical effect , as claimed in @xcite ,",
    "should become clear in future studies at finer lattice spacings .",
    "as the data at small gluino mass are preliminary , it would be premature to make judgements about this point .",
    "in this work first _ quantitative _ results on the low - energy spectrum of @xmath91 supersymmetric yang - mills theory are obtained .",
    "physical volumes larger than 2 fm have been simulated , which is the volume usually required for spectrum studies in lattice gauge theory .",
    "the comparison of masses on different volumes in otherwise same conditions reveals negligible finite size effects at least for moderate gluino masses .",
    "we have collected higher statistics and have used efficient dynamical algorithms such as ts - phmc , which is suitable for light fermion masses . in addition , the supersymmetric ward identities and other observables like the confinement potential have been investigated .    from the results of the mass spectrum",
    "the question of the gluino - gluino and gluino - glueball mass splitting remains open .",
    "it can only be answered by further simulations allowing an extrapolation to the continuum limit .",
    "this work has been supported by the german science foundation ( dfg ) under contracts mu757/9 and mu757/13 , and by the john von neumann institute for computing ( nic ) with grants of computing time .",
    "k.d .  would like to thank the german academic exchange service ( daad ) for support .",
    "the numerical simulations of this work have been performed on the blue gene l / p and jump systems at jsc jlich , opteron pc - cluster at rwth aachen and the ziv pc - cluster of the university of mnster .",
