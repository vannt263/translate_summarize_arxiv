    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) and critical phenomena play an important role in the study of many - body quantum systems @xcite . during the last decade",
    ", a new kind of phase transition has been studied in depth the excited - state quantum phase transition ( esqpt ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to qpts , which describe the non - analytical evolution of the ground state energy as a function of a control parameter , esqpts refer to a similar non - analytic behavior that takes place at a certain critical energy @xmath2 , when the control parameter responsible for the qpt is kept fixed @xcite .",
    "esqpts have been theoretically studied in many kinds of quantum systems .",
    "paradigmatic examples are the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) @xcite , the dicke and tavis cummings models @xcite , the interacting boson model @xcite , the molecular vibron model @xcite , atom - molecule condensates @xcite , the kicked - top @xcite or the rabi model @xcite .",
    "also , a number of experimental results have been recently reported , in molecular systems @xcite , superconducting microwave billiards @xcite , and spinor condensates @xcite . however , and despite the intense research performed during the last couple of years , some important questions still remain open . the most important",
    "one is whether the critical energy does separate two different phases in the spectrum .",
    "contrary to what happens in quantum and thermal phase transitions , there are no clear traces of order parameters in esqpts .",
    "though many physical observables become singular at the critical point , it seems impossible to find a magnitude which is zero at one side of the transition , and remains different from zero at the other ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "a recent proposal relies on symmetry - breaking .",
    "a number of quantum systems showing esqpts are characterized by a discrete @xmath3 symmetry which can be broken at one side of the transition , but not at the other .",
    "this fact entails measurable dynamical consequences if a thermodynamic process is performed from a symmetry - breaking initial condition the symmetry of the final equilibrium state remains broken only if the final energy is at the corresponding side of the transition , whereas the symmetry is restored on the contrary @xcite .",
    "however , if the initial condition has a well - defined value of this symmetry , nothing similar happens when crossing the critical energy .",
    "another recent proposal consists on how the values of the physical observables change with energy @xcite .",
    "anyhow , this complex behavior is in contrast with what happens in quantum and thermal phase transitions , where the two different phases are easily distinguishable just by measuring an appropriate observable .",
    "notwithstanding , from fundamental physical reasons a link between esqpts and thermal phase transitions is expected .",
    "esqpts occur when the system is kept isolated from any environment , and thus can be described by means of the microcanonical ensemble . on the contrary , thermal phase transitions take place at a certain critical temperature @xmath4 , and are usually described considering that the critical system is in contact with a thermal bath , that is , by means of the canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "but , as microcanonical and canonical descriptions become equivalent in the thermodynamical limit @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of particles of the critical system , it is logical to expect that critical energy @xmath2 and critical temperature @xmath4 are two manifestations of the same phenomenon .",
    "if we describe the critical system by means of the canonical ensemble , we should expect that the critical energy @xmath2 of the esqpt corresponds to the internal energy @xmath7 , evaluated at the critical temperature @xmath4 , being @xmath8 the canonical partition function . and",
    "if the system is described by means of the microcanonical ensemble , the critical temperature @xmath9 should correspond to the microcanonical temperature @xmath10 , evaluated at the critical energy @xmath2 , being @xmath11 the density of states .",
    "however , all the facts discussed below suggest just the opposite that thermal and excited - state quantum phase transitions are totally different . probably , this is due to the fact that esqpts take place in systems with a small number of semiclassical degrees of freedom , implying that the size of the corresponding hilbert space grows as @xmath12 , being @xmath13 the number of degrees of freedom the larger the number of degrees of freedom , the less important are the consequences of the esqpt @xcite ) . on the contrary ,",
    "thermal phase transitions require an exponential growth of the size of the hilbert space with the number of particles , in order to assure that intensive thermodynamical quantities , like the entropy per particle @xmath14 or the helmholtz potential per particle @xmath15 are well defined in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "hence , it is not clear even if the correspondence between thermal and excited - state quantum phase transitions exists , or if they are different phenomena occurring under different physical circumstances .",
    "( we notice that , during the progress of this work , a similar analysis , but with a different aim , was performed in the generalized dicke model , showing that it shows two different kinds of superradiance @xcite ) .",
    "in this work we tackle this task by studying , both analytically and numerically , the dicke model .",
    "it describes a system of @xmath6 two - level atoms interacting with a single monochromatic electromagnetic radiation mode within a cavity @xcite .",
    "it is well known from the seventies that this model exhibit a thermal phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , recently it was also found that undergoes an esqpt @xcite aside the qpt @xcite .",
    "this kind of qpt has been experimentally observed in several systems @xcite , and the dicke model itself can be simulated by means of a bose - einstein condensate in an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "all these facts make this model the best one to study the link between thermal and excited - state quantum phase transitions .    up to now",
    ", the majority of the works on the dicke model , including the ones dealing with qpts and esqpts ( except @xcite , as we have pointed above ) , were done in the subspace with maximum pseudo - spin sector @xmath1 , in which the ground state is included .",
    "this restriction is enough to properly describe the recent experimental results @xcite , and also to study all the consequences of the qpt .",
    "furthermore , esqpts have been observed in the subspace with @xmath1 , which can be described by means of a semiclassical approximation with just two degrees of freedom in the thermodynamic limit @xmath16 .",
    "however , it is well known that this restriction destroys the thermal phase transition @xcite ; the fact that the atomic subspace grows linearly with @xmath6 in the @xmath1 sector makes impossible to properly define the entropy @xmath17 or the helmholtz potential @xmath18 , and therefore precludes the thermal phase transition . in this work",
    "we deal with the complete dicke model , including all the @xmath0 sectors .",
    "contrary to the seminal papers on the thermal phase transition @xcite we study the thermodynamics of this model in the microcanonical ensemble , considering the system isolated instead of being in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "this point of view allows us to link the esqpt with the thermal phase transition .",
    "in particular , we show that each @xmath0 sector displays the same kind of esqpt , provided that the coupling constant is large enough ( see below for a detailed discussion regarding this condition ) , but having each one a different critical energy @xmath2 .",
    "paradoxically , this fact , together with the different weight of each @xmath0 sector in the spectrum of the complete dicke model , destroys most of the signatures of the esqpt , and somehow surprisingly entails the appearance of the typical signatures of thermal phase transitions , like the existence of an order parameter .",
    "in particular , we show that the collective contribution of all the @xmath0 sectors rules out the logarithmic singularities in the derivatives of the density of states , @xmath11 , and the third component of the angular momentum , @xmath19 , characteristic of the esqpt .",
    "however , one of the most important signatures of the esqpt survives .",
    "the parity symmetry of the dicke model ( see below for details ) can be still broken below the critical energy @xmath2 ( or the critical temperature @xmath4 ) , but it is always well defined above .",
    "we show that the expectation value of a symmetry - breaking observable , like @xmath20 , is always zero above @xmath2 , but it can be different from zero below . and",
    "we prove that the critical temperature @xmath4 exactly coincides with the microcanonical temperature @xmath9 evaluated at the critical energy @xmath2 .",
    "thus , and even all the @xmath0 sectors take part in the dynamics of the system , the consequences of this symmetry breaking can be dynamically explored if the system remains isolated from any heat bath if it is _ heated _ by means of the joule effect . therefore , as both the esqpt and the thermal phase transition are characterized by the same fundamental property , the fact that the parity symmetry can be only broken below the critical energy @xmath2 , making possible to find symmetry - breaking equilibrium states , we conclude that both phenomena are manifestation of the same underlying physical mechanism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath21 we present the dicke model . in section",
    "@xmath22 we review the thermodynamics of the dicke model restricted to the highly - symmetric dicke states , @xmath23 .",
    "we compare the results provided by the micro and canonical ensembles , and we analyze the symmetry - breaking character of the esqpt . in section @xmath24 we perform a similar analysis including all the @xmath0 sectors .",
    "we show that an esqpt occurs in each @xmath0 sector , and that the collective contribution of all of them produces the thermal phase transition .",
    "we also show that the symmetry - breaking nature of the transition is still present if the system remains isolated from any heat reservoir .",
    "in addition , we study the main physical differences between the system in isolation and in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "finally , we extract the more relevant conclusions in the last section .",
    "the dicke model describes the interaction of @xmath6 two - level atoms of splitting @xmath25 with a single bosonic mode of frequency @xmath26 , by means of a coupling parameter @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the usual creation and annihilation operators of photons , and @xmath31 is the schwinger pseudospin representation of the @xmath6 two - level atom system , that is , the total angular momentum of a system of @xmath6 @xmath32-spin particles .",
    "this hamiltonian has two conserved quantities .",
    "the first one is @xmath33 \\right)$ ] , due to the invariance of @xmath34 under @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; as this is a discrete symmetry , @xmath37 has only two different eigenvalues , @xmath38 , and it is usually called _ parity_. the second one is the total angular momentum @xmath39 of the @xmath6 @xmath32-spin particles .",
    "this entails that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : dicke ] ) is block - diagonal in @xmath39 , and hence each sector is totally independent from the others .",
    "the main dynamical consequence is that each @xmath0 sector evolves independently in any protocol keeping the dicke model isolated from any heat bath .",
    "furthermore , as the recent experimental realizations of this model involve only the sector of maximum angular momentum , @xmath40 , the great majority of the papers published during the last couple of years are devoted to this case .",
    "this model shows qpts , esqpts and thermal phase transitions . in the following paragraphs we summarize the known results",
    "in this section , for the sake of completeness , we review the thermodynamics of the dicke model restricted to the highly - symmetric dicke states , @xmath41 .",
    "this configuration corresponds to a two - level system in which @xmath6 bosons can occupy either the upper or the lower level @xcite .",
    "it has been recently explored by means of a bose einstein condensate in an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "first of all , we present the density of states @xmath11 , which is computed by means of the microcanonical ensemble , and later we show the same @xmath11 but considering the calculation in the canonical ensemble .",
    "these are well established results . finally , we compare both approaches and get some conclusions .",
    "let s consider that the system is thermally isolated and that we perform the following procedure : first , we freeze the system keeping fixed all the external parameters of the hamiltonian , up to it is equilibrated at @xmath42 .",
    "this entails that the ground state , which always correspond with the sector of maximum angular momentum @xmath1 , is the only populated energy level .",
    "second , we perform a quench , abruptly changing one of the external parameters . then , if the system remains thermally isolated from the environment , the unitary evolution is totally captured by the sector with @xmath1 .",
    "hence , all the thermodynamic results after the system is equilibrated at the final values of the external parameters should be obtained from a microcanonical calculation with fixed @xmath1 .",
    "this calculation can be completed by means of a semiclassical approximation , following different methods @xcite . here ,",
    "we follow the method in ref . @xcite",
    ".    considering @xmath43 , the density of states reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the third component of the angular momentum , we obtain @xmath47 finally , for the first component of the angular momentum and considering that the parity is totally broken in the initial state , @xmath48 where the sign depends on the initial state . this expression has been obtained taking into account only one of the two disjoint parts in which the semiclassical phase space is divided for @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "if the initial state has a well - defined parity , both parts of the semiclassical phase space are populated , giving rise to @xmath51 .",
    "these results show that an esqpt happens at @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "there are singular points for both @xmath53 and @xmath54 the derivatives of both magnitudes show a logarithmic divergence at @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the following : the density of states , eq .",
    "( [ eq : densidad ] ) , is proportional to the size of the phase space available to the system , @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the semiclassical coordinates ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the semiclassical momenta , and @xmath60 is a normalization constant ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the key point is that despite this semiclassical system is _ finite _ , it describes the quantum dicke model in the thermodynamical limit , @xmath16 , and it has just @xmath61 degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , every quantum system showing an esqpt is equivalent to a semiclassical system with a finite number of degrees of freedom ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a consequence , non - analyticities in the quantum density of states",
    "are linked to stationary points in the corresponding semiclassical model ; and the geometric properties of such stationary points determine the nature of the corresponding singularities .",
    "in particular , systems with @xmath62 semiclassical degrees of freedom show logarithmic singularities in the density of states as well as in certain physical observables at the critical energy of the esqpt , @xmath2 , whereas systems with @xmath61 degrees of freedom show the same kind of singularities in the derivatives of the same magnitudes @xcite .",
    "results for an higher number of degrees of freedom have been recently published , showing that the larger @xmath13 , the higher derivative in which the logarithmic singularity takes place @xcite .",
    "also , if the parity symmetry is broken in the initial state , @xmath63 acts like an order parameter for the esqpt ; that is , it shows a finite jump at @xmath2 , from @xmath64 to @xmath65 @xcite . on the contrary , initial conditions with well - defined positive ( or negative ) parity",
    "do not suffer any change when crossing the esqpt .",
    "another singular point is located at @xmath66 , whilst its critical character is controversial @xcite . above this energy , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , due to the ergodic character of the atomic motion ( now the whole phase space is accesible to the system ) . despite this point",
    "is not usually identified as an esqpt , it has some of the features of a second order phase transition .",
    "first , there exists an order parameter identifying two different phases : for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , whereas @xmath68 for @xmath71 .",
    "second , there is a discontinuity in the derivative of @xmath11 , that is , in the second derivative of the cumulated level density @xmath72 . we will come back to this discussion in sec . [",
    "sec : todo_j ] .",
    "numerical results illustrating these facts are shown later .",
    "the same kind of calculation can be performed in the canonical ensemble , considering that the system weakly interacts with a thermal bath which commutes with @xmath39 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we can obtain the partition function @xmath73 where @xmath74 the final result is @xmath75 \\frac{\\exp \\left ( \\beta ( n+1 )   \\sqrt{\\omega_0 ^ 2 + \\frac{4 \\lambda^2 x^2}{n } } \\right ) - 1}{\\exp \\left ( \\beta \\sqrt{\\omega_0 ^ 2 + \\frac{4 \\lambda^2 x^2}{n } } \\right ) -1}.\\ ] ] there is no way to write this integral in terms of simple analytical functions , but it can be evaluated numerically to obtain results for precise values of all the external parameters @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , other thermodynamic results can be obtained from the partition function @xmath76    @xmath77    in all the cases @xmath78 .",
    "it has been shown that there is no thermal phase transition under these circumstances @xcite .",
    "in other words , microcanonical and canonical ensembles give rise to totally different results .",
    "if the system remains thermally isolated there exists a critical energy @xmath79 at which a non - analiticity occurs , giving rise to a number of dynamical ( and observable ) consequences @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the system is put in contact with a thermal bath , everything changes smoothly with the temperature @xmath9 ; in particular , nothing happens at the _ critical _ temperature @xmath4 , @xmath80 .      in this subsection",
    ", we compare the results of both the microcanonical and the canonical calculations , for a system with @xmath43 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "all the results are plotted versus the scaled energy @xmath83 . for the canonical calculation ,",
    "this energy is obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : energia ] ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : jz_jmax ] , [ fig : derjz_jmax ] , and [ fig : jx_jmax ] we depict the results for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 respectively . in the first two cases ,",
    "we show both the microcanonical ( solid green points ) and the canonical ( dashed red line ) calculations ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : jx_jmax ] , we show just the microcanonical calculation , because @xmath51 in the canonical ensemble . in all the cases",
    "we show the critical energy of the esqpt , @xmath87 , by means of a vertical dashed line .    as a general result , we can observe that the behavior of the dicke model in the @xmath1 sector is totally different depending whether it is thermally isolated or in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "in the first case , we can see neat signatures of the esqpt ( a singular point in @xmath88 , or the crossing from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , if the parity symmetry is broken in the initial state ) . in the second one , no traces of such phenomena are present .",
    "the reason behind this result is that the microcanonical density of states grows linearly with @xmath6 .",
    "this entails that the thermodynamic magnitudes that should be extensive , like the entropy , @xmath17 , or the helmholtz free energy , @xmath18 , grow with @xmath91 , and therefore @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the main consequence is that the different ensembles are not equivalent in the thermodynamic limit , and that thermodynamics in this system is far from usual , and hence the results for the different statistical ensembles do not coincide .",
    "in this section , we perform a similar analysis as the former one , but now including all the @xmath0 sectors in the calculation .",
    "if we consider that the system is thermally isolated , we can follow the same procedure than for the case with @xmath1 , taking into account that each @xmath0 sector is totally independent from the others .",
    "in other words , we can rely on the semiclassical approximation for each @xmath0 sector , and then collect all these results .",
    "note , however , that the semiclassical approximation only gives good results for large values of the total number of two - level atoms , @xmath6 .",
    "hence , our procedure is questionable for sectors with low values of @xmath0 , and , in particular , for the @xmath94 sector .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail later on .",
    "formally , the dicke hamiltonian does not depend on the value of @xmath0 , and hence the full case consists just of @xmath95 copies of the @xmath1 case , weighted by the corresponding degeneracy .",
    "however , there is a subtle detail that we have to take into account .",
    "the full hamiltonian reads @xmath96 nevertheless , the hamiltonian for the case with @xmath1 is slightly different , @xmath97 as we can see , the only difference is in the interacting term : the coupling constant @xmath27 is normalized in a different way . for the case",
    "@xmath1 , this difference is irrelevant , since @xmath98 .",
    "however , if we want to take advantage from this case to describe the full hamiltonian , we have to take into account this small difference .",
    "in particular , we can consider that each @xmath0 sector is a copy of the @xmath1 case , but with the coupling constant normalized to @xmath99 .",
    "in other words , the full hamiltonian consists of the sum of @xmath95 copies of the @xmath1 hamiltonian , but with different effective couplings .    with this in mind",
    ", we proceed to discuss the presence of esqpts in each @xmath0 sector . from the results derived in the section [ sec : jmax_micro ] , we conclude :    1 .",
    "esqpt appears if @xmath100 .",
    "this entails that each @xmath0 sector shows an esqpt if @xmath101 , being @xmath102 therefore , the @xmath94 sector does not exhibit an esqpt in any case ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the lower values of @xmath0 require so large coupling constants for having an esqpts , that these transitions are going to be restricted to the larger values of @xmath0 in all the practical cases .",
    "the critical energy for each sector is located at @xmath104 , and the energy of the other singular point at @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the lower @xmath0 , the smaller is the energy band between these two singular points .",
    "if @xmath106 with a coupling constant large enough for the esqpt to occur , the band shrinks to a single point located at @xmath107 .",
    "3 .   for any finite value of the coupling strenght in the superradiant phase , @xmath108 ,",
    "the dynamics of the full hamiltonian is the result of collecting all the @xmath0 sectors , with both critical and non - critical behavior .    considering that each @xmath0 sector is totally independent from the others ,",
    "the density of states for the full hamiltonian can be obtained as @xmath109 being @xmath110 the degeneracy of each @xmath0 sector , and @xmath53 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : densidad ] ) .",
    "the degeneracy is obtained as the number of ways in which a set of @xmath6 @xmath32-spin particles can give rise to a total angular momentum @xmath0 .",

    "( [ eq : jz ] ) . and",
    "@xmath118 with @xmath119 given by eq . (",
    "[ eq : jx ] ) .",
    "all these integrals have to be performed numerically since it is not possible to get analytical expressions .",
    "as it has been pointed before , this procedure assumes that all the @xmath0 sectors can be properly described by means of the semiclassical approximation , and this is not completely true .",
    "therefore , the goodness of the final result critically depends on the shape of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deg ] ) .",
    "if the subsequent integrals are dominated by sectors with @xmath0 large enough , we can rely on our procedure ; if they are dominated by the lowest @xmath0 sectors , the procedure is not going to work .",
    "so , prior to present the numerical results , we study here the shape of the function @xmath120 .",
    "in particular , we analyze : _ i ) _ the sector with the largest degeneracy , @xmath121 ; and _ ii ) _ the ratio between the degeneracy of this sector and the one with @xmath94 , @xmath122 . to be sure that our approximation is correct , we requiere that , on the one hand @xmath123 and , on the other hand @xmath124 , both in the thermodynamical limit @xmath16 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     results for the finite - size precursor of the critical energy @xmath125 are shown in fig .",

    "calculations have been performed as follows . in the left panel , @xmath125 is estimated as the energy corresponding to the minimum of @xmath130 .",
    "though not explicitely shown , this minimum becomes less pronounced as the system - size grows , vanishing in the thermodynamical limit . in the right panel , @xmath125 is identified as the energy at which @xmath131 becomes less than @xmath132 .",
    "this bound is arbitrary , but we are not interested in quantitative results for each system size @xmath6 , but in their scaling with the system size . from the results shown in fig . [",
    "fig : scaling_energy ] , we can conclude that the finite size precursor @xmath125 tends to the critical energy @xmath2 , with a power - law finite - size scaling .",
    "+    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_jz ] we show the same results for the critical value of the third component of the angular momentum , @xmath133 . though in this case the scaling is not so clean , we still can conclude that @xmath134 , with @xmath135 .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the relationship between the thermal phase transition and the esqpt in the dicke model .",
    "first of all , we have studied the thermodynamics of the model by means of microcanonical and canonical ensembles , and we have found that both approaches are incompatible if we considerer just the maximum spin representation , i. e. @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is that the size of the hilbert space grows linearly with the number of atoms , @xmath6 , instead of exponentially .",
    "the main consequence is that extensive thermodynamic magnitudes , like the entropy @xmath17 or the helmholtz potential @xmath18 , do not scale with the number of particles @xmath6 ; hence , thermodynamics is anomalous in this model , and the different ensembles are not equivalent in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath16 . in order to get a correct description of the thermodynamics properties it is necessary to include all the @xmath0 sectors .    to perform the microcanonical calculation including all the @xmath0 sectors , we have considered that all them can be adequately described by means of the semiclassical approximation . in order to check this approximation",
    "we have analyzed the scaling behaviour of the largest degeneracy , @xmath121 , as well as the ratio between the degeneracy of this sector and the one with @xmath94 .",
    "our findings show that the contribution of lower @xmath0 sectors is negligible in the thermodynamical limit , so the major contribution come from the sectors with @xmath0 large enough .",
    "this makes possible the employ of the semicclassical approximation in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "we have shown that each @xmath0 sector is equivalent to the one with @xmath1 , but with a smaller effective coupling strength .",
    "the main consequence is that , despite all of them have an esqpt if the global coupling strength @xmath27 is large enough , for any finite value @xmath108 there are a large number of @xmath0 sectors which are in the normal phase . to illustrate this fact ,",
    "we have computed different magnitudes for different @xmath0 values : the density of states @xmath11 , the derivative of the density of states @xmath136 , the third component of the angular momentum @xmath84 , the derivative of the third component of the angular momentum @xmath137 , the temperature , @xmath9 and the first component of the angular momentum , @xmath138 .",
    "we have found that the esqpt converges into the well known thermal phase transition , when all the @xmath0 sectors are taken into account .",
    "this fact entails that the main signatures of the esqpt , in particular the logarithmic singularities characteristic of the critical energy @xmath2 , are ruled out .",
    "however , @xmath138 still changes from a value different from zero below the critical energy or the critical temperature , to zero above them .",
    "this fact shows that the superradiant phase is characterized by the possibility of breaking the parity symmetry ; in other words , @xmath20 plays the role of an order parameter , provided that the initial condition has the parity symmetry broken .",
    "all this findings are well supported by a finite size scaling . from all these facts , we conclude that the esqpt and the thermal phase transition are different manifestations of the same phenomenon .    finally , we have also discussed the main physical differences between the dicke model in isolation and in contact with a thermal bath . despite both the microcanonical and canonical descriptions mainly coincide in the thermodynamic limit , one important difference remains .",
    "if the system is in contact with a thermal bath , that is , if it is described by means of the canonical ensemble , the energy @xmath139 constitutes an upper bound ; this energy implies @xmath140 , and thus can not be exceeded in any experiment . on the contrary , if the system remains thermally isolated and is _ heated _ by means of the joule effect , for example by quenching @xmath141 repeatedly , the limit @xmath139 can be exceeded ; in other words , @xmath142 are accesible in the microcanonical description .",

    "<S> we study the thermodynamics of the full version of the dicke model , including all the possible values of the total angular momentum @xmath0 , with both microcanonical and canonical ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on how the excited - state quantum phase transition , which only appears in the microcanonical description of the maximum angular momentum sector , @xmath1 , change to a standard thermal phase transition when all the sectors are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both the thermal and the excited - state quantum phase transitions have the same origin ; in other words , that both are two faces of the same phenomenon . despite all the logarithmic singularities which characterize the excited - state quantum phase transition are ruled out when all the @xmath0-sectors are considered , the critical energy ( or temperature ) still divides the spectrum in two regions : one in which the parity symmetry can be broken , and another in which this symmetry is always well defined . </S>"
