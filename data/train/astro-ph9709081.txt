    "recent work @xcite has shown that at least some fraction of the  absorption lines seen in the spectra of low redshift qsos arises in the extended haloes of galaxies . at high redshift absorbers",
    "are found to be strongly clustered @xcite and many contain ionised carbon @xcite .",
    "this suggests that some fraction of high redshift  absorbers may also be identified with the haloes of galaxies .",
    "thus it seems likely that the  forest may exhibit large scale structure .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that significant clustering may be missed when using the classical tool of cluster analysis , the two - point correlation function @xcite . here , we present a new technique to search for non - randomness in the spatial distribution of the  forest based on the first and second moments of the transmission probability density function .",
    "this method is able to identify the strength , position and scale of individual structures since it retains spatial information .",
    "it is fairly insensitive to noise and resolution characteristics and is easy to apply in practice .",
    "the new technique has been tested with the help of synthetic spectra and it was found to be substantially more sensitive than a two - point correlation function analysis .",
    "the method was applied to the spectra of a close group of eight qsos with a mean redshift of 2.97 .",
    "the data @xcite was kindly made available to us by gerry williger ( see also these proceedings ) .",
    "figure [ liskef1 ] shows the result of the analysis . the most prominent feature is a @xmath6 overdensity of absorption at 3978    ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is due to the spectra of q0041 - 2707 and q0041 - 2658 .",
    "the two lines of sight are separated by @xmath8 proper mpc ( @xmath3 ) and the feature covers @xmath9  km / s in velocity space .",
    "williger et  al .",
    "@xcite find metal absorption at redshift 2.2722 in the spectrum of q0041 - 2658 , which is remarkably consistent with the redshift of the overdense structure .",
