    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are optically classified into type 1 and type 2 : a type 1 object shows broad emission lines ( bels ) that are absent in type 2s . the strict agn unified model @xcite states that the apparent large diversity in agn properties is caused almost entirely by different viewing angles and nuclear luminosities . an agn is identified as type 2 when a dusty torus is viewed at large inclination ( more edge - on ) and obscures the bel region , while a torus in a type 1 agn is viewed at lower inclination and does not block the bel region .    in the past few decades",
    ", the unified model has achieved tremendous success in explaining the general properties of agns .",
    "however , there are indications that its axioms may not be universal ; parameters other than orientation may influence the observed agn properties .",
    "for example , the host galaxy may play an important role in the type 1/type 2 division .",
    "it has been found that a significant fraction of type 2 agns are actually obscured by kpc - scale material in the host galaxy instead of the sub - kpc dusty torus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the typical level of star formation in a type 2 host galaxy is also found to be higher than that in a type 1 host @xcite , implying that a more dusty type 2 host increases the probability of obscuration of the bel region . in radio - loud agns ,",
    "infrared observations indicate that a significant fraction of type 2 radio galaxies harbor intrinsically weaker nuclei than type 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "there are also claims that agns with intrinsically weak bel emission may exist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , spectropolarimetric observations reveal hidden bel ( hbel ) regions in only half of type 2 seyferts @xcite .",
    "the comparison between seyfert 2 galaxies with and without hbels reveals a significant difference in the nuclear luminosity between the two populations @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear if the low nuclear luminosity of seyfert 2 nuclei without hbels is simply due to a larger host galaxy contamination for a given nuclear luminosity or if seyfert 2 galaxies without hbels harbor genuinely weak nuclei .    in the standard model ,",
    "a type 2 object shows only narrow optical emission lines in total light and has strong x - ray obscuration .",
    "the hi equivalent column density can be inferred through fitting photoelectric absorption models to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "as expected , the hi column densities of 96% of type 2 agns are larger than 10@xmath5 @xmath4 , and they are therefore considered to be x - ray obscured @xcite . however , with the increasing volume of x - ray spectral data , a small sample of type 2 agns has been found to be relatively unobscured in the x - ray @xcite . in the literature , they are defined as type 2 agns with @xmath6 @xmath1 10@xmath5 @xmath4 .",
    "this sample of unusual agns may offer the best means to refine the unified model and may identify exceptions to the model that would modify our overall view of the subject .",
    "various explanations have been proposed to understand the nature of this unusual type of agn : ( 1 ) compton - thick behavior : the x - ray spectra of compton - thick objects in the energy range @xmath1 10 kev are dominated by the reflection of the nuclear emission off the far side of the torus and the hi column densities inferred from x - ray spectral fits are similar to those for unobscured objects ; ( 2 ) dilution : the bels in these objects are overwhelmed by host galaxy light .",
    "( 3 ) variability : some agns change their optical classification on a timescale of years to decades as a result of the location of obscuring material on pc scales .",
    "such objects might be classified as unobscured ( in the x - ray ) type 2 objects by chance , if the x - ray and optical data are obtained at different times .",
    "( 4 ) s / n effect : the bel can be hidden in a low - s / n optical spectrum while the compton - thick signature can be lost in a low s / n x - ray spectrum ; ( 5 ) exceptions to the agn unified model : in contrast to the above speculations that still fit the unified model , these x - ray - unobscured type 2 agns may harbor genuinely weak bel regions , and thus are not the simple obscured version of type 1 agns expected from the unified model .    in this paper , we will first combine _ spitzer _ ir data with data in the literature to update the current list of x - ray - unobscured type 2 agn candidates .",
    "we then review the members of this list to identify objects that can be explained by points 1 - 4 above and that are therefore not true unobscured type-2 objects . of 24 candidates from the literature , less than a third",
    "are possible true unobscured type-2 agns .",
    "we evaluate these candidates , including using metrics for relative broad line strength , and find that the broad lines in two of them are at least two orders of magnitude weaker than in typical type-1 agns .",
    "their irs / spitzer spectra indicate that we have a pole - on view of their circumnuclear tori , consistent with the x - ray measurements of small absorbing columns toward their nuclei .",
    "thus , the properties of these two agns appear to be contradictory between type-1 levels of obscuration but type-2 line properties . we conclude that agn with intrinsically weak bels are very rare , but that they do exist .",
    "we develop our arguments as follows . in section  [ data ] , we describe the sample selection and data analysis . in section  [ cont_unagn ] ,",
    "we eliminate contaminants to the sample of x - ray - unobscured type 2 agns , including type 1 agns and compton - thick objects .",

    "additional measurements in the x - ray may elucidate whether they are weak - bel agn .",
    "in comparison , the strong aromatic features in the spectrum of ngc 7590 indicate powerful nuclear star formation that might cause our metrics to underestimate the intrinsic bel strength relative to the continuum emission of the agn .    for typical agns , the existence of the dusty tori has been demonstrated extensively through thermal ir continuum observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the dust temperature generally decreases monotonically with distance from the central accretion disk .",
    "therefore , while the bel region is obscured by the dusty torus , the inner hot wall is also invisible and obscured by the outer cold part . in this case",
    ", a silicate absorption feature should be present , i.e. , the smooth torus model can not explain the simultaneous presence of the silicate emission feature and a type 2 optical spectrum in these agns .",
    "the smooth dusty model may over - simplify the real situation for agns in general .",
    "for example , the seyfert-2/seyfert-1 ratio of 4 indicates a large covering factor and thick torus @xcite , as is also found by interferometric imaging of nearby seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "a thick smooth model is also dynamically unstable against gravitational force .",
    "consequently , several models have been proposed based on a thick cloudy structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "clumpy models can explain the compton - thick / compton - thin transitions in some objects @xcite in terms of a compton - thick cloud moving through the line of sight .",
    "in general for agns , the transition of the silicate feature from emission to absorption with increasing x - ray obscuration supports the predictions of the clumpy model @xcite . for the unobscured type 2 agns ,",
    "the silicate emission is therefore consistent with the small level of x - ray absorption ( see fig . 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "both characteristics indicate that the dusty torus is viewed face - on , i.e. , it is not likely that a dusty torus can obscure any bel region if it exists in these agns .",
    "the co - existence of the silicate emission feature , the type 2 optical spectrum and the small x - ray obscuration is therefore not compatible with standard proposals for the circumnuclear tori in these agns .",
    "it has been suggested that their tori may have a higher - than - normal dust - to - gas ratio ( i.e. @xmath60 ) , leading to much higher obscuration of the bel region than that of the x - ray emission .",
    "however , since the torus must still be viewed edge - on to obscure the bel region , this model is inconsistent with the presence of the silicate emission feature .",
    "there are several theoretical works that predict the disappearance of the bel region under certain bolometric luminosities or accretion rates @xcite . in order to compare our sample to the predictions of these models ,",

    "the hot cloud outflow is further suppressed , resulting in a vanishing of the bel regions . as shown in figure  [ lbol_ledd ]",
    ", ngc 4594 has a bolometric luminosity below 10@xmath63 erg s@xmath28 .",
    "however , this galaxy shows strong silicate emission features at both 9.7 and 18 @xmath24 m , indisputable evidence for the existence of the dusty torus .",
    "@xcite have derived a lower bound below which the bel does not exist , which is even more difficult to make compatible with our results .",
    "there is a limit on the maximum velocity of the bel ( @xmath2 25 , 000 km s@xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "using the well - known correlation between the bel size and the luminosity , such a limit implies bels may not exist at low luminosities for a given bh mass .",
    "this critical luminosity is approximately 10@xmath64(@xmath65 erg s@xmath28 .",
    "only one object is below this limit in figure  [ lbol_ledd ] .",
    "although the maximum velocity is observationally uncertain , to include most of our sample in the region where @xcite would predict no bel , the required maximum velocity needs to be ten times lower , obviously inconsistent with the observations .",
