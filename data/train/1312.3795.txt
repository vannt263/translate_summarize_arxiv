    "in this paper we consider representations of @xmath10 , the free group of rank two , into @xmath11 .",
    "the latter group is a three - fold covering of @xmath0 , which is the holomorphic isometry group of complex hyperbolic two - space @xmath12 .",
    "the deformation space which is the space of conjugacy classes of representations @xmath13 it is not hard to see that the dimension of this space is the same as that of @xmath11 , namely four complex dimensions or eight real dimensions",
    ". we will be particularly interested in those representations with many parabolic elements . the locus of points in @xmath14 where a given group element is parabolic is an algebraic real hypersurface .",
    "in particular , if @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a given generating set for @xmath15 then we shall only consider those representations @xmath16 for which @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are all parabolic .",
    "we say that such a representation of @xmath10 to @xmath11 is _",
    "parabolic_. since these three conditions are independent , this means that the space of parabolic representations is a five dimensional subspace of @xmath14 .",
    "we will very often use the alternate presentation @xmath20 , which gives an identification of @xmath10 with the fundamental group of the 3-punctured sphere . with this identification ,",
    "parabolic representations of @xmath10 are thus representations of the 3-punctured sphere mapping peripheral loops to parabolics .",
    "it is a well known fact that there is only one such representation in psl(2,@xmath21 ) up to conjugacy .",
    "we will describe here the corresponding deformation space for su(2,1 ) .    before giving our main results ,",
    "we now indicate our motivation .",
    "there is a beautiful description of the @xmath11 representation space of closed surface groups due to goldman @xcite , toledo @xcite and xia @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are _ complex hyperbolic quasi - fuchsian _ representations of a surface group to @xmath11 ; see parker - platis @xcite for a survey on this topic .",
    "in particular , parker and platis , problem 6.2 of parker - platis @xcite , ask whether the boundary of complex hyperbolic quasi - fuchsian space comprises representations with parabolic elements and they ask which parabolic maps can arise . we can consider a decomposition of the surface into three - holed spheres and then allow the three boundary curves to be pinched , so they are represented by parabolic elements .",
    "the fundamental group of a three holed sphere is a free group on two generators @xmath15 .",
    "the condition that the three boundary curves are pinched is exactly that @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 should all be parabolic .    if @xmath22 is parabolic then , of course , the product @xmath23 is parabolic as well , and considering its fixed point we obtain an ideal tetrahedron in @xmath24 ( an ordered @xmath25-tuple of boundary points ) .",
    "the shape of the tetrahedron @xmath26 is a conjugacy invariant of the representation @xmath27 that we are going to use to give a coordinate system on the family of conjugacy classes of representations . moreover",
    "the shape of a tetrahedron @xmath28 for a parabolic representation @xmath27 can not be arbitrary . indeed we prove that if @xmath27 is a parabolic representation of @xmath10 to @xmath11 then @xmath28 is _ balanced_. an ideal tetrahedron @xmath29",
    "is balanced when @xmath30 and @xmath31 are mapped to the same point by the orthogonal projection onto the geodesic connecting @xmath32 and @xmath33 . to see this",
    ", we connect the shape of the tetrahedron to the conjugacy classes of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 via the complex cross - ratio @xmath37 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , we prove in corollary [ 3spherecrossratio ] that when @xmath27 is parabolic we have : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively the eigenvalues associated to the boundary fixed points of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are parabolic , these eigenvalues all have unit modulus , which implies that the cross - ratio also has unit modulus .",
    "this condition is equivalent to saying that the tetrahedron @xmath28 is balanced , as proved in section [ balancedsection ] .",
    "the next question is the converse . given a balanced ideal tetrahedron @xmath46 , and given three unit complex numbers",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that holds , can we construct a parabolic representation @xmath47 such that @xmath48 as before ?",
    "the answer is yes , if we allow that @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are parabolic or complex reflections .",
    "this ambiguity comes from the fact that an isometry having a boundary fixed point with unit modulus eigenvalue can be either parabolic or a complex reflection ( see section [ section - conj - class ] ) .",
    "this is proposition [ repep ] .",
    "we focus next on the case where the three ( unit modulus ) eigenvalues @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 all are equal . from",
    "they are necessarily all the same cube root of the cross ratio .",
    "we show that such a representation admits a three fold symmetry . in particular",
    ", it is a subgroup of a @xmath1 group generated by two regular elliptic maps @xmath49 and @xmath50 or order 3 whose product @xmath51 is parabolic .",
    "specifically , we prove ( theorem [ thm - symmetric - groups ] ) :    suppose that @xmath52 has the property that @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath53 are all parabolic and have the same eigenvalues .",
    "then @xmath54 is an index 3 subgroup of a @xmath11 representation of the @xmath1 group .",
    "this leads to our main result connecting the representation to geometry of complex hyperbolic space , ( theorem [ thm - main1 ] ) :    there is a bijection between the set of @xmath0-orbits of non - degenerate balanced ideal tetrahedra , and the set of @xmath0-conjugacy classes of @xmath1 groups in @xmath0 .    using a normalisation of balanced tetrahedra",
    ", we obtain an explicit parametrisation of the order 3 generators of @xmath55-group .",
    "next , we investigate when more group elements are parabolic .",
    "in particular , we can prove ( corollary [ cor - superpinching ] ) :    there is a one parameter family of groups generated @xmath43 and @xmath44 in @xmath11 so that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath22 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 $ ] are all parabolic .",
    "it would be very interesting to find out whether any ( or all ) of these representations are discrete and free , and also whether or not it is possible to find any more parabolic elements .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for basic material on the complex hyperbolic space",
    ". we will denote by @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively the cartan invariant ( see chapter 7 of @xcite ) and the complex cross - ratio ( see @xcite , and chapter 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that the group of holomorphic isometries of the complex hyperbolic is @xmath0 .",
    "elements of @xmath0 are classified by the usual trichotomy : loxodromic , elliptic and parabolic isometries . as in the classical cases of @xmath62 and @xmath63 it is possible to detect the types using the trace of a lift of an element of @xmath0 to @xmath11 .",
    "however certain subtleties arise here that we would like to describe as they will play a role in our work .",
    "let us first recall the trace classification of isometries ( theorem 6.4.2 of @xcite ) .    [ prop - class - trace ] let @xmath43 be a non trivial element of @xmath0 and @xmath64 a lift of it to @xmath11 .",

    "note that a complex reflection does not necessarily have finite order , contrary to the usual terminology in real spaces .",
    "a parabolic isometry @xmath70 is called unipotent whenever it admits a unipotent lift @xmath71 .",

    "the deltoid_. in view of proposition [ prop - class - trace ] , this curve is the zero - locus of the polynomial @xmath65",
    ". however proposition [ prop - class - trace ] tells us that if @xmath69 , then we need more information to know the type of the isometry @xmath43 , as it could be a complex reflection .",
