    "the unexpected discovery of large polarization in inclusive @xmath2 production by unpolarized protons has shown that important spin effects arise in the hadronization process .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain hyperon polarization , being the thomas precession model ( tpm)@xcite one of the most extensively used to describe polarization in a variety of reactions .    in order to obtain the @xmath2 polarization ,",
    "we first calculate the momentum fraction of the recombining @xmath3-quark in the proton sea using a recombination model @xcite .",
    "we use two different forms for the recombination function to see their influence on the predicted @xmath2 polarization .",
    "in @xmath4 collisions the recombining @xmath3-quark resides in the sea of the proton and carries a very small fraction @xmath5 of the proton momentum . when the @xmath3-quark recombines to form a @xmath0 , it becomes a valence quark and must carry a large fraction ( of the order of @xmath6 ) of @xmath7 s momentum .",
    "then one expects a large increase in the longitudinal momentum of the @xmath3-quark as it passes from the proton to the @xmath0 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the proton s momentum , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the momentum of the @xmath0 with @xmath12 the feynman @xmath13 .",
    "since the @xmath3-quark carries transverse momentum , on the average @xmath14 , its velocity vector is not parallel to the change in momentum induced by recombination and it must feel the effect of thomas precession .",
    "consequently , the @xmath2 is produced with net polarization perpendicular to the plane of the reaction .    according to the tpm",
    "the @xmath2 polarization in the reaction @xmath15 is given by@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 as was assumed in ref .",
    "@xmath19 gev is a characteristic recombination scale and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the masses and transverse momentum of the diquark , the @xmath3-quark and the @xmath26 .",
    "we use the recombination model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has been extended to take into account baryon production @xcite , to obtain a parametrization for @xmath28 as a function of @xmath12@xcite .",
    "the inclusive @xmath12 distribution for @xmath2 s in @xmath29 collisions is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the three quark distribution and recombination functions respectively .",
    "for the three quark distribution function we use the factorized form @xmath33 with @xmath34 as has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath35 .",
    "we used the field and feynman @xcite parametrizations for the single quark distribution .    in order to see how the shape of the recombination function affects the prediction for the @xmath2 polarization , we use two different forms for @xmath36 : @xmath37 as in ref .",

    "hwa @xcite . in @xmath39 , unlike @xmath40 , the light quarks are considered with different weight than the more massive @xmath3 quark introducing two distinct exponents @xmath41 and @xmath42 . indeed , in the recombination model proposed in ref .",

    "the two forms for @xmath28 obtained with the two different recombination functions of eqs . [ siete ] and [ ocho ] are very similar in shape for large @xmath12 . for small @xmath12",

    "the parametrizations for @xmath27 obtained from the recombination model are different to the simple form proposed in ref .",
    "our calculation of @xmath27 shows that , for @xmath62 , @xmath63 approximately for both recombination functions .",
    "this is consistent with our actual knowledge of the sea structure functions in the proton .",
    "we have seen that for small @xmath25 our fit gives a good description of experimental data .",
    "this is reasonable since recombination models work better for small @xmath64 .    within the precision of experimental data@xcite[7 ]",
    ", it would be hard to decide which recombination function better describe @xmath0 s production . a more accurate measurement of polarization at low @xmath65 and low @xmath12 can help to clarify the right form of the recombination function .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although the shape of the recombination function is not important for cross section calculations , it does make a difference when applied to polarization . in this sense , polarization measurements can help to understand the underlying mechanisms in hadroproduction .",
