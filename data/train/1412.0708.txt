    "a concordance of observations support a universe of dark matter ( dm ) , but all concrete evidence for its existence is solely based upon its gravitational interactions @xcite .",

    "the notion that dm could interact through inelastic channels has been proposed @xcite . by fine tuning the inelastic interactions",
    ", these models can simultaneously accommodate seemingly conflicting experimental results .",
    "a natural way to incorporate inelastic interactions into a model is to allow dm to be composite , rather than point - like @xcite . to create composite particles in a dark sector ,",
    "modelers introduce a new dark gauge group which results in a binding force among the composite s constituents .",
    "the simplest gauge group is @xmath3 @xcite . if the symmetry is unbroken , then the dark photon is massless and can kinetically mix with the standard model ( sm ) photon . in such models ,",

    "this permits the existence of dark atoms which are overall electrically neutral , but made of constituents with electric millicharge @xcite .",
    "the dark atoms form bound hydrogenic states under the exchange of dark photons , yet their tiny coupling to sm photons opens the possibility that these dark atoms can be probed with sm electromagnetism .",
    "we will explore this possibility in what follows .",
    "as the dark atoms are electrically neutral , they are essentially invisible to low energy photons . however , for photons which are near the threshold energy needed to transition the dark atom to an excited state , an electromagnetic wave can resolve the charge distribution within the atom .",
    "considering dark matter as a bulk medium , the interaction between dark matter and light can be characterized in terms of an electric susceptibility and index of refraction @xcite . for photon energies below the transition energy @xmath4 ,",
    "the medium will rather generically exhibit dispersion quadratic in the photon energy @xmath5 for constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , this is the expected form for the refractive index from the classical lorentz model for dielectrics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this form extends to the realm of particle physics . combining fermi s generalized index of refraction formula @xcite with the low - energy theorems governing the forward scattering amplitude of photons on point - like particles @xcite yields the same structure for the refractive index .",

    "the dispersive term in the index of refraction can be constrained by astrophysical observation .",
    "if a broadband pulse of light is emitted over a short timescale from an astrophysical object such as the crab pulsar or a gamma - ray burst @xcite , then a dispersive medium of dark atoms creates a time delay between higher and lower frequency photons .",

    "@xcite , would rule out the dark protons and electrons constrained by our dispersion limits .",
    "observations of the crab pulsar place severe constraints upon the dispersive nature of the interstellar medium in the milky way , yet these constraints are only relevant for a narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "even more severe constraints can be derived from distant sources like gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , and these constraints span a much broader spectral range .",
    "grbs produce an intense burst of high - energy photons on a short time scale which can be viewed over cosmological distances , increasing the effective baseline , @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ time_lag ] ) , between the source and observer .",
    "the high - energy photons from grbs , upwards of 100 gev , have the potential to constrain composite millicharged dark matter of greater mass , and the associated optical , infrared , and radio afterglow allow for their use in broadband observations .",
    "the high energy photons from distant grbs have already been used to place lower bounds on the scale at which lorentz - invariance violating effects could modify the photon s dispersion relation @xcite . along similar lines , we will consider how the ( non-)observation of dispersion , attributable to dark matter , impacts the properties of composite dark matter .",
    "relative to the crab pulsar , using grbs for dispersion studies has two drawbacks : the intergalactic dm density is much smaller and the temporal profile of the source is not known . with regards to the dm density , the crab pulsar is within the milky way where the dark matter halo density is relatively large . for distant grbs ,",
    "the average dm density is @xmath97 gev/@xmath40@xcite , a factor of @xmath98 smaller than our local density . in terms of timing",
    "resolution , the pulsar is well suited for dispersion studies because its regular rotational period means the temporal profile of light emitted from these objects is well known .",
    "grbs do not share this feature ; the spectra of the bursts @xcite and their lower frequency afterglows @xcite are varied .",
    "since dispersion measurements rely on temporal knowledge of the emission spectra , a single grb event can not yet be used to constrain dm properties . but with a large number of grb observations located at a variety of redshifts , it is expected that , statistically , random variations amongst the sources should wash out , and any real effects that indicate dispersion should survive . the fermi gamma - ray space telescope @xcite is dedicated to the task of gamma - ray observations , so that in the future , a sufficient number of grbs may be used to provide meaningful constraints . despite the present dearth of data , we will estimate the possible reach of such a study based upon the observation of a single burst .",
    "since grbs can be viewed at cosmological distances , the frequency - dependent time - lag accrued by simultaneously emitted pulses of light traveling through a dispersive medium of dark atoms requires modification due to the universe s expansion @xcite .",
    "first , the light - travel time between source and detector is dependent upon the redshift of the source and the local expansion rate .",
    "second , at redshift @xmath99 the number density of dark matter increases by a factor of @xmath100 . finally , as we look into the past , the wavelength of light blue shifts relative to its value @xmath29 at the detector ( at @xmath101 ) . incorporating these three factors , the time lag accrued between (",
    "detected ) frequencies @xmath71 and @xmath72 simultaneously emitted from a source at redshift @xmath99 becomes @xmath102 where @xmath36 is the present - day dm number density and the hubble expansion rate at redshift @xmath103 is @xmath104 .",
    "the cosmological parameters determined through the combined analysis of wmap nine - year data in the @xmath105cdm model with distance measurements from type ia supernovae ( sne ) and with baryon acoustic oscillation information from the distribution of galaxies can be found in ref .",
    "the hubble constant today is @xmath106 , whereas the fraction of the energy density in matter relative to the critical density today is @xmath107 and the corresponding fraction of the energy density in the cosmological constant @xmath105 is @xmath108  @xcite .    the maximum reach for idealized grb constraints are derived from observations of the most distant events .",
    "there have been two grb observations with confirmed redshift @xmath109 : grb 090423 with @xmath110 @xcite and grb 090429b with @xmath111 @xcite",
    ". we will use as our exemplar the observation of grb 090423 because , in addition to the burst detection , the afterglow was observed down through the radio band @xcite .",
    "the strength of the pulsar constraint relied on the fact that the detector s temporal resolution was @xmath112s .",
    "this same resolution is possible for the fermi large area telescope which detects gamma rays from 20 mev up to 300 gev @xcite ; however , this resolution is likely not possible for the variety of ground based telescopes which observe the grb afterglows .",
    "for example , the integration times for the ground - based gamma - ray burst optical and near - infrared detector are on the order of tens to hundreds of seconds @xcite .",
    "longer integration time weakens the ability to constrain dispersion for large values of the dark fine - structure constant @xmath113 , but meaningful constraints are realizable in the radio band .",
    "we estimate such constraints for grb 090423 for a small value of @xmath113 .",
    "the most competitive limits arise whenever the observed high - frequency photons are near the threshold energy @xmath114 ; however , we must be mindful that the wavelength blueshifts as we look into the past . in order to not surpass the threshold energy at redshift @xmath99 ,",
    "we must limit the measured high frequency photons to @xmath115 . assuming this , along with a large separation between high and low frequency bands @xmath116",
    ", we find limits on the electric millicharge of the dark electron to be @xmath117^{-1}\\ ] ] consulting ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that the location of grb090423 was observed by several radio telescopes but detection of the afterglow was only confirmed by the plateau de bure interferometer @xcite ( at 100 ghz ) and the very large array ( vla)@xcite ( at 8.46 ghz ) .",
    "these detections were separated by eight days , so they can not provide a meaningful constraint .",
    "what is needed is near simultaneous multi - band detection of the grb ; at best , we can make a reasonable estimate of the reach of such a detection .",
    "we suppose that a high frequency observation is made by the vla at 8.46 ghz while a lower frequency observation is made by another telescope .",
    "typical integration times for these telescopes are on the order of tens of minutes , but for our purposes , we suppose a somewhat optimistic integration time of 100 s. then , if the detection of the grb can be established at 8.46 ghz and a lower frequency within this 100 s window , we find that this measurement could constrain the electric millicharge of a dark atom with masses @xmath118 kev and @xmath119 to be @xmath120 .    this estimate is competitive with terrestrial constraints on the existence of millicharged particles derived from colliders . for particle masses below 200 mev , the slac electron beam - dump experiment @xcite limits the particle s millicharge to be @xmath121 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "millicharged particles with masses in the kev range would disrupt big - bang nucleosynthesis in the early universe ; constraints upon the light degrees of freedom would preclude the existence of these millicharged particles @xcite .",
    "dark matter models which consist of composite states under some unbroken @xmath0 gauge symmetry can explain possible dm signals in the dama / libra and cogent experiments that are seemingly inconsistent with the null results from the cdms - ii and xenon100 experiments . in some models , the dark photon mixes with the standard model photon resulting in electric millicharges for the particles in the dark sector .",
    "this interaction with the sm photon results in non - trivial optical properties for a dark - matter medium .",
    "we computed the electric susceptibility of a medium of dark atoms and determined that such a medium is dispersive .",
    "the dispersion can result in time lags between simultaneously emitted pulses of light of differing frequencies .",
    "using stringent limits on the ( optical ) frequency dependence of the speed of light from the crab pulsar , we are able to constrain the properties of a dark matter medium consisting of dark atoms . for a dark fine structure constant @xmath2 , we find that we can limit the electric millicharge of dark ( electrons ) protons to be less than the sm proton charge , @xmath122 , for dark atom masses below 100 kev .",
    "millicharged particles in this mass range have been ruled out by collider searches and interact too strongly to be consistent with the dark matter haloes of elliptical galaxies .",
    "grbs yield more stringent constraints on the dispersion of the cosmos .",
    "given their brightness and broad spectral range , these objects are promising sources by which we can constrain millicharged atomic dark matter .",
    "we estimate that observations of the radio afterglow could result in constraints on the electric millicharge of the dark electron and proton for masses in the kev range that are competitive with collider constraints ; however , big - bang nucleosynthesis would rule out the existence of these light particles in the early universe .",
    "the technique that we develop in this work , namely that cosmic dispersion can constrain dark atomic properties , is applicable to other models of composite dark matter that have millicharged constituents . at present , we know of no other models of composite dark matter with millicharged constituents .",
    "likely , this is due to parsimony ; i.e. , the composite system is bound under some broken gauge group so that charged constituents under a new @xmath0 gauge group would be superfluous .",
    "however , the dark sector could be as complex as the standard model sector , and the constituents of the composite dark matter could indeed couple to dark photons , opening the possibility that they acquire an electric millicharge",
    ". if this is the case , then dispersive constraints would impact the parameters of the composite dark matter model .",
