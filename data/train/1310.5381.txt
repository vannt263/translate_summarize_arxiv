    "black hole ( bh)-neutron star ( ns ) mergers are promising sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) to be detected by interferometric detectors of second ( advligo / virgo @xcite ) and third ( et , @xcite ) generation .",
    "the detection of gw signals from these processes will provide valuable information on the ns internal structure , which would be impossible to obtain otherwise .",
    "for this reason , in recent years much effort has been devoted to model the signal emitted during the latest phases of the inspiralling of ns - ns and ns - bh binaries , when the imprint of the equation of state ( eos ) on the signal is more pronounced ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , the best strategy to extract as much of information as possible on the ns eos from a detected signal is still under debate .",
    "addressing this question is the main scope of this work .",
    "we shall focus on the latest inspiralling , when ns deformations can be large , and we shall use two quantities which encode information on the ns eos , to compare different strategies : the tidal deformability @xmath0 ( which will be defined in section  [ sec : model ] ) and the stellar compactness @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ns gravitational mass and @xmath3 its radius .",
    "if the companion is a black hole , under appropriate conditions a ns can be disrupted by the tidal interaction before being swallowed . in this case",
    "the gw - signal exhibits a frequency cut - off @xmath4 which also depends on the eos .",
    "most of the articles cited above include either @xmath0 ( or @xmath5 ) or @xmath4 in the model ; in this paper , we shall include both parameters in the signal template and , using recently proposed analytic fits of @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite , and a fisher matrix approach , we shall evaluate whether a joint analysis can improve the possibility to gain information on the ns eos with respect to an approach which includes only one of these quantities .",
    "it should be stressed that tidal disruption in bh - ns or ns - ns binaries is of particular interest , since they are have been invoked as possible engines of short gamma - ray bursts @xcite ( for a review on the subject , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we shall discuss which is the most useful quantity to be used in order to constrain the eos of matter in the ns interior . in the literature",
    ", it is often assumed that the most valuable information that gw physicists ( or astrophysicists ) can provide to nuclear physicists is the value of the ns radius @xmath3 or , equivalently , the star compactness @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a possibility is to estimate @xmath0 from a detected gw signal and then derive @xmath3 from it @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0 itself could be used to constrain the ns eos @xcite .",
    "we shall compare these two approaches , assessing their ability to discriminate among different eos .    in this paper we shall consider the advanced gw detectors advligo / virgo , and third generation detectors like et .",
    "since et is expected to detect gw signals from coalescing binaries up to 2 gpc , the cosmological redshift will be consistently included in the template waveforms .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly introduce the tidal deformability @xmath0 and the cut - off frequency and in section [ sec : template ] we show how these parameters can be included in a waveform template . in section [ sec : strategies ] we discuss how @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be used to extract information on the ns eos . in section",
    "[ sec : lambdac ] we discuss whether the tidal deformability has to be preferred to the stellar compactness as a parameter to discriminate among different eos . in section [ sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "finally , in appendix [ app : fisher ] we sketch the basic elements of parameter estimation theory .",
    "we remark that section [ sec : strategies ] refers to bh - ns binary systems , while in the rest of the paper we consider both bh - ns and ns - ns binaries .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the parameters which depend on the equation of state of matter in the ns interior , and which appear in the late inspiralling gw signal : the love number , describing the star deformability , and the cut - off frequency which appears in the emitted signal when a ns is tidally disrupted by a companion bh before merging .",
    "ns tidal deformations can be described in terms of a set of parameters , the love numbers @xcite , which relate the mass multipole moments of the deformed star with the external tidal multipole moments .",
    "the quantity which encodes most of the information on stellar deformation is the quadrupole love number @xmath9 , given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the star traceless quadrupole tensor , and @xmath12 is the tidal tensor of the gravitational field ( @xmath13 is the parallel transported tetrad attached to the deformed star , and @xmath14 is the riemann tensor ) .",
    "the ratio between the quadrupole and the tidal tensors , @xmath15 is the ns _",
    "tidal deformability_.    @xmath9 and @xmath0 can be computed by studying the quadrupolar , stationary perturbations induced by a test tidal field acting on the ns @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that the love number - or , more precisely , the tidal deformability - is related to the momentum of inertia of the star and to its rotation - induced quadrupole moment by the so - called `` i - love - q relations '' , which are almost independent of the eos and of the ns mass ; a similar universal relation can be found between the tidal deformability and the ns compactness @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "tidal interactions affect the gravitational signal emitted by coalescing compact binaries , and these effects are currently included in the gravitational waveforms within approximation schemes , as the post - newtonian expansion ( pn ) , or the effective one body ( eob ) formalism . in these frameworks",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the leading contribution is given by an extra term in the phase of the signal , which is proportional to the tidal deformability .",
    "therefore , the detection of a signal emitted in a ns - bh or a ns - ns coalescence can , in principle , allow to determine @xmath0 or @xmath9 .",
    "the accuracy with which second and third generation detectors will be able to measure @xmath0 has recently been estimated through a data analysis based on fisher matrix or markov chain monte carlo techniques ( see app .  [",
    "app : fisher ] and @xcite for a general discussion on the fisher matrix formalism ; see @xcite for the markov chain monte carlo approach )",
    ". using the eob formalism and a large class of eos , it has been shown that @xmath0 can be measured by advanced detectors if the signal emitted by a coalescing ns - ns binary is detected with signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath16 @xcite . in the case of bh - ns binaries ,",
    "a similar estimate has been carried out using phenomenological waveforms obtained matching pn templates with the outcome of fully relativistic simulations , finding that the tidal deformability can be extracted for sources whose mass ratio @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the bh mass ) is @xmath19 , at @xmath20 mpc with 10%-40% accuracy by advligo / virgo , and with an order of magnitude better accuracy by the einstein telescope @xcite .",
    "markov chain monte carlo approaches have been employed in @xcite , showing that , for ns - ns binaries , few tens of detections by advanced interferometers will be required to strongly constrain @xmath0 .      in the coalescence of a bh - ns binary system ,",
    "the ns can be tidally disrupted before plunging into the bh .",
    "this phenomenon can occur if the star is very deformable , if the bh is rapidly spinning , or if the mass - ratio is very small ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise , the ns behaves nearly as a point particle until the very last stages of the coalescence , and it is swallowed by the bh without being disrupted .",
    "when the ns is tidally disrupted , the gravitational signal exhibits a clear signature : the waveform amplitude steeply drops down at a _ cut - off _ frequency @xmath21 @xcite ( see also @xcite for a general description of the process ) .",
    "so far , studies of @xmath21 for bh - ns binaries have been carried out with either semi - analytical approaches @xcite or fully numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the first proposal of using a measure of @xmath22 to determine @xmath3 goes back to more than a decade ago @xcite ; in that article a relation , based on simplifying assumptions and derived in a newtonian framework , was proposed to connect @xmath22 with @xmath3 .",
    "a much more accurate relation between @xmath22 and the compactness @xmath8 ( and then @xmath3 ) has recently been proposed @xcite , based on the results of fully relativistic simulations of bh - ns coalescences : @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "these simulations have been performed assuming that the bh is non - rotating , and that the mass - ratio of the binary is @xmath25 , therefore the fit ( [ fcutc ] ) can only be trusted under these assumptions . in the next two sections we shall exploit the fit ( [ fcutc ] ) ; therefore , we shall focus on bh - ns binaries with zero bh spin and @xmath25 .",
    "realistic bh - ns binary systems are thought to have larger values of the mass ratio and a large bh rotation rate @xcite .",
    "the analysis carried out in the present paper can easily be extended to such configurations , once fully relativistic simulations of these systems will be available .",
    "post - newtonian gw templates which include finite size effects , accurately describe the evolution and the gravitational emission of bh - ns and ns - ns binaries up to the last orbits before the merger @xcite .",
    "however , they do not encode information about ns tidal disruption which may possible occur .",
    "this can be done , as a first approximation , including in the gravitational template a cut - off at the frequency @xmath22 ; this value will be treated as one of the parameters of the template .",
    "we shall model the inspiral waveform as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the standard taylorf2 approximant of the gw signal in the frequency domain @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider optimally oriented observers , such that the 3 pn amplitude reads : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the chirp mass , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the source distance .",
    "the coefficients @xmath33 are given by eq .",

    "finally , @xmath36 represents the point - particle contribution to the gw phase , currently known at the 3.5 pn order @xcite , while @xmath37 describes the effects of tidal interactions @xcite , and it is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 ; the rescaled tidal deformability @xmath40 is related to the tidal deformability @xmath0 ( defined in eq .",

    "the function @xmath45 appearing in the extended template ( [ hfit ] ) reproduces the sharp decrease in the amplitude corresponding to tidal disruption ; we choose it to have the form @xmath46 we have also considered different forms of the cut - off function @xmath47 , finding that such change does not significantly affect our results . to compare the approximate waveform given in ( [ hfit ] ) with the waveforms produced by numerical simulations of binary coalescence , @xmath48 , it is useful to compute the overlap of the two signals , given by @xmath49 where ( see appendix [ app : fisher ] ) @xmath50 @xmath51 is the detector noise spectral density , and the integration is performed in the frequency range @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "it is worth remarking that although the gravitational waveform given by eq .",
    "( [ hfit ] ) represents only a coarse approximation of the true signal around the tidal disruption frequency , it is accurate enough for the study we intend to carry on in this work .    for binary sources at cosmological distances , which are the main target of the third generation detector et",
    ", the gw signal has to be properly redshifted . as discussed in @xcite , the point particle phase @xmath53 and the signal amplitude @xmath54 are invariant under the general transformation @xmath55 , where @xmath56",
    "this means that using the point - particle approximation we can only set constraints on the redshifted chirp - mass @xmath57 and on the luminosity distance @xmath58 : if the proper distance @xmath32 is unknown , it is impossible to disentangle the mass parameter and the redshift .",
    "however , the tidal phase @xmath59 depends on the un - redshifted , rest - frame mass components @xmath60 , and then allows to break this degeneracy .    in this work we consider binary systems up to @xmath61 .",
    "the redshift @xmath62 is given in terms of the distance @xmath32 by the relation @xmath63 where @xmath64 km / mpc / s is the hubble constant , @xmath65 is the total matter density , and @xmath66 is the dark energy density measured by the planck satellite @xcite . in order to include the cosmological redshift in the waveform , we ( i ) replace the quantities @xmath67 with the redshifted quantities @xmath68 rescaled with @xmath56 as discussed above ( this does not change the functional form of the waveform ) ; ( ii ) modify the form of the tidal contribution and of the cut - off , eqns .",
    "( [ tidalphase ] ) and ( [ deftheta ] ) , as follows : @xmath69    once the gw signal from a ns - ns or ns - bh inspiral has been detected , it will be possible to extract the values of the binary parameters comparing the data with the gw template , through a matched filtering technique .",
    "assuming gaussian noise and sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio , the parameter variance can be estimated using the fisher matrix approach ( see for example @xcite , and appendix  [ app : fisher ] of this paper ) , which we here discuss .    in the next section",

    "( [ hfit ] ) depends on the set of parameters @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the time and the phase at the coalescence .",
    "we do not include the cosmological redshift @xmath62 among the set of parameters ( [ param3 ] ) , since we assume that @xmath62 is known a priori by coincidence measurements in the electromagnetic band .",
    "therefore , our computation will eventually yield the uncertainties on the _ un - redshifted _ parameters .",
    "the parametrization ( [ param3 ] ) leads to a @xmath73 covariance matrix ( see appendix  [ app : fisher ] ) , whose diagonal elements represent the standard deviation or the parameters ( [ param3 ] ) .",

    "if the sources are farther away , say at @xmath154 mpc as shown in the middle panels , chances to discriminate among the eos decrease , because the 1@xmath169 intervals become larger , and only when the eos is stiff and the mass is lower than @xmath171 , the quantity @xmath40 can be used as eos indicator . in the four lower panels of fig .",
    "[ errorsal ] we consider bh - ns binaries with @xmath25 and @xmath172 and @xmath173 mpc , respectively .",
    "we see that advanced detectors will be able to extract some information on the eos from @xmath40 only if the source is very close and the ns mass is lower than @xmath171 , but it should be reminded that the rate of bh - ns coalescence is much smaller than that of ns - ns , therefore to obtain a reasonable detection rate one should have access to a much larger volume space , as that allowed by the third generation detectors like et .",
    "when @xmath174 , the chances to discriminate among the eos are even smaller . in any event , comparing the right and the left panels of fig .",
    "[ errorsal ] we can conclude that @xmath40 is the parameter to use if we want to discriminate among different eos , although its effectiveness decreases with the source distance . since this is true also for third generation detectors , in the following we shall consider only the plots for @xmath40 .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ errorset ] for the detector et . as noted before , the possibility to discriminate between different eos decreases as the distance increases ; however , if the source is a ns - ns system ( upper panels ) it remains acceptable even when @xmath143 is as large as the et horizon distance , which is estimated to be about @xmath175 gpc ( right panel ) .",
    "if the source is close ( left panel @xmath173 mpc ) , the error on @xmath40 is very small and , unless the ns masses are close to the maximum observed mass there are good chances to identify at least the class to which the eos belongs .",
    "the remaining four panels of fig .",
    "[ errorset ] refer to bh - ns systems at a distance of @xmath154 mpc ( left ) and of @xmath175 gpc ( right ) .",
    "the middle panels refer to systems with mass ratio @xmath25 , the lower panels to more realistic systems with @xmath176 .",
    "we see that there is no way to give reliable information on the eos if this kind of source is at cosmological distance , regardless of the value of @xmath177 . for closer systems , and if the mass is smaller than a certain value , we could infer if the eos is soft or stiff ; for instance this could be possible for sources at @xmath173 mpc if @xmath2 is smaller than @xmath178 , for systems with @xmath25 , and if @xmath2 is smaller than @xmath171 , for systems with @xmath176 .",
    "in this work we have discussed how to extract information on the eos of matter in a neutron star interior , using the gravitational wave signal emitted in ns - ns or bh - ns coalescence . in a few years the second generation of interferometric detectors",
    "advligo / virgo should detect gw signals emitted by these sources , and chances of detection will significantly increase with the third generation detectors .",
    "the information on the ns eos is encoded in the signal emitted during the latest phases of inspiralling before merging by means of two quantities : the ns tidal deformability and , when tidal disruption occurs before merger , the cut - off frequency . assuming that a signal emitted by one or more of such systems is detected , we have evaluated the accuracy with which different parameters can be determined , using different data analysis strategies based on the fisher matrix approach and on analytical fits of the relevant quantities obtained by numerical simulations of the coalescence process .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .    * using @xmath4 to gain information on the ns eos .",
    "+ we find that , using @xmath4 as free parameter in the fisher matrix approach and the first proposed strategy , the ns compactness @xmath8 can be estimated with a relative error of the order of @xmath148 , and that its estimate has a weak dependence on @xmath143 , being the error dominated by the error on the fit @xmath179 ( see eq .",
    "( [ properr ] ) ) . the situation does not change if we use the second strategy , i.e. if we do not include @xmath4 as unknown parameter in the fisher matrix , and express the waveform template only in terms of the tidal deformation , using the fits @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus , if our goal is to estimate @xmath8 , the use of @xmath4 in the analysis is ineffective .",
    "however , if the goal is to estimate the tidal deformability @xmath40 , it is better to use the second strategy because the error reduces up to @xmath180 for more distant sources . to make this analysis we have used the same models used in @xcite to obtain the fit @xmath7 , i.e. non spinning bh - ns binaries with mass ratio @xmath25 , with the neutron star modeled using a set of piecewise polytropes .",
    "+ this study could , and should , be extended to more general bh - ns binaries , with different values of the mass ratio and different eos , and including the bh spin .",
    "the extension to spinning bhs is important because when the mass ratio is larger , or the eos is less deformable , ns tidal disruption can occur only if the bh is rapidly rotating .",
    "such extension will be possible only when fully relativistic , numerical simulations will extend the domain of validity of the fit @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , it should be stressed that the presence of a frequency cutoff in the gw signal indicates that the ns has been tidally disrupted before merging with the companion ; if the torus of dense matter which subsequently forms has sufficiently high mass , a short gamma - ray burst could be powered .",
    "therefore , estimating @xmath4 as accurately as possible is also important . * comparing @xmath40 and @xmath5 as eos indicators .",
    "+ we have discussed and compared the effectiveness of @xmath40 and @xmath5 in discriminating between different eos .",
    "to this aim , we have considered ns - ns and ns - bh binaries , modeled using a large set of eos , to be detected by @xmath181 and @xmath182 generation interferometers .",
    "we find that @xmath40 is much better than @xmath5 to constrain the ns equation of state .",
    "+ for sources at distance @xmath183 mpc , a signal emitted by ns - ns binaries detected by advanced ligo / virgo would allow to discriminate between different eos , if @xmath184 . if the signal is detected by et , different eos will be discerned even for larger distances and larger ns masses .",
    "conversely , it is very unlikely that bh - ns binaries will allow us to discriminate between different eos : this could happen only in the unlikely case of a signal detected by et from a system with @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "other improvement of this strategy that should be pursued are :    * use of more realistic gravitational wave templates , aimed at reproducing in detail the full merger of bh - ns binaries @xcite . *",
    "correlation of other binary parameters related to the neutron star structure .",
    "for instance , it has recently been shown that the peak frequency of the post merger gw signal from ns - ns mergers is strongly related with the ns radius @xcite .",
    "* use of bayesian inference for gw parameter estimation based on markov chain monte carlo algorithms @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the key points of parameter estimation theory . given a signal of the form @xmath187 , we want to extract the physical parameters @xmath188 and estimate the errors @xmath189 , were we assume @xmath190 to be the true values of the parameters . to this aim",
    "we have to compute @xmath191 , namely the probability of measuring the value @xmath188 , given the detector output @xmath192 @xmath193 where @xmath194 represents the detector noise , which is assumed to be stationary .",
    "it has been shown that @xcite @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the prior probability on the physical set of parameters and the constant of normalization is independent of @xmath188 .",
    "we define the inner product @xmath197 as @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the fourier transform of @xmath200 and @xmath201 denotes complex conjugation",
    ". the integration range can be different from @xmath202 $ ] , if specified .",
    "@xmath203 is the noise spectral density ( psd ) of the detector considered . for a given measurement",
    "the values of the source parameters can be estimated as those which maximize the probability distribution ( [ prob ] ) : this is the so called _ maximum - likelihood estimator_. moreover , we define the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath147 , such that @xmath204 evaluated at @xmath205 . in the following",
    "we will consider the limit of large signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , in which @xmath206 is sharply peaked around the true values of the source parameters .",
    "it can be easily proved that in this limit @xmath207 where @xmath208 evaluated at @xmath209 , is the _ fisher information matrix _ @xcite .",
    "this allows to define the variance - covariance matrix @xmath210 as ) . ]",
    "@xmath211 where @xmath212 is the inverse of fisher matrix . in this way",
    "we can define the error associated to the parameter @xmath213 as @xmath214 and the correlation coefficient between @xmath213 and @xmath215 as @xmath216 with @xmath217 $ ] .",
    "( [ prob1 ] ) holds whether @xmath196 is uniform around @xmath218 or not . in the first case",
    ", the probability distribution for the parameters takes a gaussian form .",
    "otherwise @xmath191 does nt represent the maximum - likelihood estimate , and it may not be gaussian . in the special case",
    "when @xmath219 is gaussian , namely @xmath220 the probability distribution @xmath191 is gaussian with covariance matrix given by @xmath221 we note that in general @xmath191 is peaked around @xmath222 , which is , in general , different from @xmath223 and @xmath218 .      99 http://www.ligo.caltech.edu , http://www.ego-gw.it http://www.et - gw.eu/. t.  hinderer , astrophys .  j.  * 677 * , 1216 ( 2008 ) ; _ ibid .",
