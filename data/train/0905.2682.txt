    "in the last few years , one of the most studied topic in network theory has been the investigation of highly inhomogeneous structures . networks with strong variability in local metric and topological properties",
    "have been shown to well represent many real structures , occurring in nature and in man - made systems .",
    "condensed matter and soft materials often feature an inhomogeneous organization in space @xcite , and even engineered devices can be constructed to reproduce a highly varying arrangement , in order to obtain the designed physical properties @xcite .",
    "such networks , being physically embedded in space , are finite dimensional and it is known that in this case inhomogeneous topology can strongly affects physical phenomena occurring on the network itself .",
    "graphs are also used to describe the generic relation between a set of elements or agents , as it happens in complex networks theory in biology , social science , computer science and economy @xcite .",
    "then , these networks often feature infinite dimensionality , and inhomogeneity has been detected in several real systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most studied structures in the literature are scale - free ( sf ) networks , which show a degree sequence scaling with a characteristic power law @xcite .",
    "this implies that highly inhomogeneous regions can be present in the network .",
    "random structures and stochastic approaches have appeared to be very useful in this framework , even if , in real cases , one always has to deal with a single realization of the disorder . due to the strong variability of the topology in the samples ,",
    "the quenched properties could not coincide with the behavior found in the typical cases , as described by the probability distribution .",
    "therefore , the study of quenched samples and deterministic topologies is a very interesting task @xcite .",
    "apart from the discussion on how and why structures with scaling degree sequences are so often encountered in nature @xcite , they certainly represent a new and interesting class of inhomogeneous graphs .",
    "original techniques have been developed in order to characterize these topologies and their effect on physical properties .",
    "however , the general topological and metric features of sf graphs , on the global and on the local scale , are still not completely understood .",
    "random walks are one of the simplest stochastic processes affected by the topology of a network and , at the same time , the basic model of diffusion phenomena and non - deterministic motion .",
    "they have been extensively studied for decades on regular lattices @xcite , fractal networks and finite dimensional inhomogeneous structures @xcite , where they have been shown to be able to evidence a new and unexpected phenomenon arising in presence of strong inhomogeneity , namely the splitting between local and average properties @xcite .",
    "the richer topology of a generic , inhomogeneous and infinite dimensional graph can have a dramatic effect on the properties of random walks , especially when considering infinite graphs , which are introduced to describe macroscopic systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "random walks represent not only a good model for diffusion phenomena on large complex networks , but also a direct way to characterize their large scale topological features , also in presence of strong inhomogeneity , and their influence on physical properties .",
    "once these are known , they could also be used to fruitfully design and engineer a network topology with given properties .    in this paper",
    "we want to deepen the analysis by studying random walks on a specific scale - free topology , namely a deterministic scale - free network , built in a recursive way and featuring a scaling distribution for the hub degrees , with an exponent @xmath3 . for this deterministic structure ,",
    "first introduced in @xcite , some metrical and spectral properties have recently been investigated in details @xcite . on the other hand , how these properties are linked to diffusion processes on the network is still an open problem .    using the formalism of random walks generating functions @xcite , we derive exact expressions for the first passage times @xcite for a random walker starting from the maximally connected hub and from the last generation  rims \" of the deterministic sf network . in particular , we investigate their dependence on the size of the network and we derive an exact expression for the mean time to first reach the most connected hub , namely the mean time to absorption if we place a perfect trap on the most connected hub .",
    "this quantity displays an extremely slow behavior as the size of the network increases , given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the size of the structure , and the mean is over a set of starting points distributed uniformly over all the other sites of the graph .",
    "interestingly , the trapping process appears to be very efficient .",
    "we also obtain an implicit relation for the generating function of the first passage probabilities from the hub to rims , and viceversa , which provides some insight into the leading singularity for the generating function of the return probability to the hub .",
    "in particular , we prove the recurrence of the main hub by exploiting the connection between random walks and electric networks @xcite .",
    "moreover , we compare the return probability to the main hub with the return probability to an end - node evidencing a very different asymptotic behavior .",
    "all the results are checked with extensive numerical calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : deterministic ] we give a brief mathematical description of the deterministic scale - free graph , introducing the language and the formalism we will use in the whole article .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] we derive the recursive relation between the first passage probabilities from hubs to rims and vice versa ; from these we calculate the exact expression for the mean time to first reach the most connected hub and its dependence on the volume of the network . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we calculate the return probability on the main hub and we discuss its recurrence in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "a generic graph @xmath4 consists in a non - empty set @xmath5 of nodes joined pairwise by a set of links @xmath6 @xcite . here we consider a particular set of deterministic graphs @xmath7 , first introduced in @xcite , which can be built recursively : at the @xmath8-th iteration one has the graph of generation @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath9 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : grafo ] ) .    starting from the so called root constituted by one single node labeled as @xmath10 ,",
    "at the first iteration one introduces two more nodes @xmath11 and connects each of them to the root ; the resulting chain of length three represents the graph of generation @xmath12 .",
    "we call @xmath13 the set of sites added at the first generation and linked to the root",
    ". then , at the second iteration one adds two chains of length three and connects each end node to the root , namely @xmath14 , so that the root will increase its coordination number from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "proceeding analogously , at the @xmath8-th iteration one introduces two replica of the existing graph of generation @xmath17 and connects the root with each site making up @xmath18 .",
    "hence , at the @xmath8-th generation the root turns out to be the main hub with coordination number @xmath19 , the set of all nodes has cardinality @xmath20 and @xmath21 . as shown in @xcite",

    "indeed , on the one hand the graph becomes very complex and there exists a set of few [ @xmath32 nodes whose coordination number grows indefinitely , on the other the number of nodes with degree @xmath33 become large indefinitely ; as a result the average degree remains finite , conversely the second moment @xmath34 is divergent .",
    "it should also be underlined that by increasing @xmath8 the number of cycles grows fast ; as a result , while the number of end - nodes grows linearly with the volume @xmath2 ( @xmath35 ) , the average distance from the main hub increases only logarithmically with @xmath2 ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "therefore , the probability of reaching in @xmath43 steps site @xmath39 starting from @xmath38 is @xmath44    in the following we denote with @xmath45 the probability that a rw on @xmath9 , starting from a site @xmath38 reaches the site with label @xmath39 at time @xmath43 and @xmath46 the probability that the same walk reaches the site @xmath39 for the first time at time @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , we consider the probability @xmath47 that , at the generation @xmath8 , a walk starting from any site in @xmath18 first reaches the central hub and the probability @xmath48 that a walk starting from the central hub first reaches any site in @xmath18 .    now , the following equations hold @xmath49 and @xmath50 some comments are in order here . in a graph of generation @xmath8 , each rim is connected to @xmath8 nodes of which one is the main hub ; this accounts for the first term in eq .",

    "once the thermodynamic limit is taken , a divergence in @xmath132 for @xmath146 would imply that the main hub is recurrent @xcite .",
    "recurrence can alternatively be proven by exploiting the connection between random walks an electric networks .",
    "the escape probability can be determined by calculating the effective resistivity @xmath147 at fixed distance from the hub , when all the links of the network are replaced by unit resistors and a unit voltage is applied between the hub and the points at fixed distance from it .",
    "then , taking the thermodynamic limit , the relation between the escape probability from the hub and the effective resistivity of the network reads @xcite : @xmath148 where , we recall , @xmath149 is the coordination number of the hub at generation @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath150 diverges in the thermodynamic limit , the hub is recurrent , while if it converges to a finite value , there is a finite probability of escape from the hub . on highly inhomogeneous graphs such as our scale - free networks , however , a vanishing @xmath151 may not necessarily imply that the mean number of visits to the hub is infinite @xcite .    in general , when the unit voltage is applied to the resulting circuit , by symmetry one can detect nodes which are at the same voltage ( e.g. the rims ) and short them together without affecting the distribution of currents in the branches , nor the effective resistivity .",
    "in this way , by applying the standard rules for the sum of resistors in series and in parallel , one can build an equivalent network for the circuit , in terms of the total resistivity . to better exploit the symmetry properties of the network , we consider only even values of @xmath8 , so that the points at a maximum distance from the hub are topologically equivalent ( an analogous relation can be easily obtained if only odd values of @xmath8 are considered ) . with some algebra one",
    "then obtains : @xmath152 holding for even @xmath8 .",
    "hence , recalling that @xmath149 we derive that the main hub is recurrent .",
    "in this work we studied the random walk problem on a class of deterministic networks exhibiting both a scale - free , @xmath153 , and an exponential , @xmath154 , degree distribution .",
    "the latter holds for a subset of nodes called rims which are at a distance @xmath155 from the main node . adopting a generating function formalism we calculate the exact average time @xmath156 to first reach the hub , where the mean is taken over all possible walks connecting a site @xmath38 to the hub and over all starting nodes @xmath38 .",
    "the leading behaviour for @xmath156 turns out to be @xmath157 , where @xmath2 is the total number of sites making up the network .",
    "analogous power - law behaviours were found previously for exactly decimable fractals @xcite as well as for other deterministic scale - free networks @xcite and apollonian networks @xcite , however the structure considered here results remarkably effective , being @xmath158 .",
    "the reason lays in the large number of cycles and in the multi - fractal nature of the the graph under study which determines a very short average distance from the main hub .    in the second part of the work we focused on the probability to first return to the main hub and we obtained a recursive formula for its generating function which allows to get some insight into the local topological properties of the hub .",
    "in particular , the recurrence of the hub is proved by mapping the graph into an electrical network whose effective resistivity provides the escape probability from the hub .",
    "hence , in the thermodynamic limit , a splitting between average and local properties occurs : transience in the average is expected due to the diverging dimensionality , while the hub is locally recurrent .    finally , we compared the return probability to the main hub with the return probability to one of the outer nodes evidencing different asymptotic behaviors .",
    "this further highlights the strong inhomogeneity of the graph considered .",
