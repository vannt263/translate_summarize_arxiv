    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials have been extensively studied in the last decade @xcite owing to their applications in electronics and optoelectronics @xcite .",
    "2d materials consist of layers that are held together by weak van der waals forces .",
    "a remarkable feature of these layered materials is the difference in properties of a monolayer compared to multilayers of the same material @xcite .",
    "for instance , monolayer of mos@xmath0 has a direct band gap , while multilayers of mos@xmath0 have an indirect gap @xcite .",
    "most gapped 2d materials , like transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) , hexagonal boron nitride and phosphorene , show an unmistakable reduction in band gap with the number of layers @xcite .",
    "first principles electronic structure calculations , based on the gw @xcite approximation , have resulted in band gaps that are in excellent agreement with experiments @xcite on these materials .",
    "band gaps of these materials calculated using density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , while underestimated , also show a clear reduction with the number of layers @xcite .",
    "most studies have attributed this reduction in the band gap to quantum confinement @xcite . however , there are no studies that _ quantitatively explain _ this trend .",
    "the idea of quantum confinement comes from the model of an electron in a one - dimensional box . in multilayer stacks of 2d materials ,",
    "the confining length of the box is directly proportional to the number of layers . in this context , the increase in the confinement length in multilayers as compared to a monolayer , due the summing of constituent layer potentials , is attributed to quantum confinement . on adding the potentials of constituent layers , the inter - layer spacing creates a finite barrier in the interstitial region between adjacent layers .",
    "this barrier with a dft calculated hartree potential profile has been used to _ qualitatively _ explain the trend in the layer dependence of the band gap in phosphorene @xcite .",
    "recently , perturbation approaches @xcite , which need input from explicit multilayer calculations , have been used to study layer dependence of band structures .",
    "furthermore , in the case of tmdcs , it has been shown that the quasiparticle band gap calculated using the gw approximation converges extremely slowly with the number of unoccupied states , k - point sampling and the screened coulomb cut - off @xcite . performing separate gw calculations for a monolayer , bilayer , trilayer or more with parameters that ensure convergence is computationally very challenging . to study the variation of properties as a function of interlayer spacing or stacking of the layers needs one to repeat the calculation for different parameters .",
    "moreover , gw calculations on heterostructures of 2d materials are presently intractable due to their lattice incommensurability necessitating the use of large supercells of each material .",
    "identifying the origin of layer dependence opens up the possiblity of deriving ground state and excited state properties of multilayer stacks from calculations on a monolayer alone .",
    "doing so would immensely ease the computation cost incurred in performing separate dft and gw calculations for different configurations of the constituent layers .",
    "we study the physical origin of layer dependence in band structures of 2d materials .",
    "we show that while quantum confinement gives _ qualitatively _ the right trend , the non - linearity of the @xmath1 functional plays a crucial role in _",
    "quantitatively _ determining the layer dependence .",
    "we show that within dft , band structures of multilayer stacks can be derived from a single calculation on a monolayer of the material .",
    "we also extend this scheme to obtain quasiparticle energies of multilayer systems from a single gw calculation on a monolayer of the material .",
    "we apply this method to understand the layer dependence of band structure in multilayers of a prototypical tmdc , 2h - mos@xmath0 , and compare the results to the standard calculations on this material @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the transferability of this scheme by applying it to graphene and phosphorene .",
    "we performed the dft calculations using the plane - wave pseudopotential method as implemented in quantum espresso @xcite package .",

    ", we used a wavefunction cut - off of 70 ry and 40 ry respectively .",
    "the local density approximation to the exchange - correlation functional @xcite was used in mos@xmath0 and graphene calculations . for phosphorene we used the perdew - burke - ernzerhof exchange - correlation functional @xcite .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 k - point grids for mos@xmath0 , graphene and phosphorene respectively .",

    "the bilayer and trilayer were constructed from the monolayer with the appropriate stacking and inter - layer spacing .",
    "no atomic relaxations were allowed in the bilayer and trilayer . the supercell dimension in the out - of - plane direction",
    "was fixed at 35 .",
    "the gw calculations were performed using the berkeleygw package @xcite . for mos@xmath0 , the dielectric function was evaluated with plane waves upto a cutoff of 35 ry and was extended to finite frequencies using the generalized plasmon pole ( gpp ) @xcite model .",

    "it can not arise from the hartree potential since it is a linear functional of the charge density and here the charge density of the bilayer is a sum of the charge densities of the individual layers . it can not arise from the ionic potential either , due to the absence of atomic relaxations in the bilayer . the difference must arise due to the non - linearity of the exchange - correlation functional . fig .

    "a slight difference upto 5 - 10 mev is found due to a small rearrangement of charge in the bilayer or trilayer as compared to the sum of the constituent layer charge densities . hence to obtain the _ quantitative _ layer dependence , both the effects of quantum confinement and non - linearity of the exchange - correlation functional need to be accounted for .",

    "[ fig2 ] show a transition from a direct band gap at k in the monolayer to an indirect band gap from @xmath31 to @xmath30 in the bilayer .",
    "the transition is driven by the large splitting of the vbm at the @xmath31 point and cbm at the @xmath30 point . the k point vbm and cbm on the other hand split only slightly .",
    "the amount by which a band splits depends on the off - diagonal elements of the multilayer hamiltonian represented in the basis of the constituent layer wavefunctions and the overlap between the wavefunctions of the constituent layers .",
    "the vbm and cbm of the monolayer at k are localised in space , have a large mo d orbital character [ see fig [ fig3 ] ] .",
    "the cbm at @xmath30 and vbm at @xmath31 on the other hand have a strong s p@xmath33 character [ see fig [ fig3 ] ] .",
    "they are hence more delocalized in the out - of - plane direction and hybridize more with the wavefunctions of other layers than the wavefunctions at k. this leads to the large splittings in the band structure at these points for the bilayer and trilayer [ see fig [ fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) ] . the vbm and cbm at k , vbm at @xmath30 and cbm at @xmath31 show little to no spliting in the band structures owing to their localized nature",
