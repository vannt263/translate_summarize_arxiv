    "symbiotic stars ( syss ) are usually interacting binaries , composed of a cool star , a hot component and a nebula .",
    "the cool component is a red giant which is a first giant branch ( fgb ) or an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star .",
    "the hot component is a white dwarf ( wd ) , a subdwarf , an accreting low - mass main - sequence star , or a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the peculiar optical spectrum of syss is a very important and interesting phenomenon , and offers some exciting observational facts @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the majority of the known galactic syss are detectable x - ray sources . according to rosat observations of syss , @xcite divided x - ray sources into three distinct classes : @xmath4-type x - ray sources in which the photon energies are below 0.4 kev ; @xmath5-type x - ray sources in which the photon energies are roughly between 0.1 and 10 kev and the peak at about 0.8 kev ; and @xmath6-type relatively hard x - ray sources like gx 1 + 4 . following @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we call @xmath4-type x - ray sources as super - soft x - ray sources ( ssss ) , @xmath5-type x - ray sources as soft x - sources ( sss)@xcite . due to hard x - ray sources resulting from accreting neutron stars @xcite , we do not discuss them in the present paper .    in general , ssss result from the steady hydrogen burning on accreting wd in binary systems .",
    "while for sss , it was widely believed that they are arisen from the colliding winds from the giant and wd @xcite . in recent years , many theoretical studies on syss have been published , e.g. @xcite . however , there are few detailed theoretical studies about the galactic population of x - ray sources in syss .",
    "@xcite investigated the galactic binary ssss with white dwarf accretors by means of a population synthesis .",
    "they considered that ssss in syss result from the steady hydrogen burning and thermonuclear runaways , but they did not distinguish sss from ssss .    in the present paper we model possible formation paths for the galactic population of sss and ssss in syss with white dwarf accretors . in section 2 , we present our assumptions and describe some details of the algorithm . in section 3 , we discuss the main results . in section 4 , the main conclusions are given .",
    "for binary evolution , we use a rapid binary star evolution ( bse ) code of @xcite .",
    "below we describe our algorithm from several aspects .",
    "syss are complex binary systems , and can be divided into two subgroups : ` ordinary ' syss , which are assumed to burn hydrogen steadily ; and symbiotic novae , which experience thermonuclear runaways in their surface hydrogen layers @xcite .",
    "there are many uncertain physical parameters which can affect the population of syss .",
    "@xcite showed that the numbers of syss and the occurrences of symbiotic novae are greatly affected by the algorithm of common envelope evolution , the terminal velocity of stellar wind @xmath7 and the critical ignition mass @xmath8 which is necessary mass accreted by wd for a thermonuclear runaway .",
    "the structure factor of the stellar wind velocity @xmath9 and an optically thick wind give a small uncertainty . in this work",
    ", we use the models of syss in @xcite and discuss the galactic population of sss and ssss in syss .",
    "+ common envelope :  following @xcite and @xcite , we use two algorithms ( @xmath4-algorithm and @xmath6-algorithm ) for common envelope evolution . the @xmath4-algorithm results in much shorter binary separation after undergoing common envelope phase than the @xmath6-algorithm . in this work ,",
    "we take the ` combined ' parameter @xmath10 as 0.5 for @xmath4-algorithm .",
    "@xmath11 is a structure parameter that depends on the evolutionary stage of the donor . for @xmath6-algorithm , @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 :  it is difficult to determine the terminal velocity of stellar wind @xmath13 . @xcite used two completely different @xmath13s : + ( i)@xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the escape velocity .",
    "with ascent of star along giant branch , the stellar radius becomes larger and larger , which results in the lower @xmath7 .",
    "+ ( ii)using the relation between the mass - loss rates and the terminal wind velocities fitted by @xcite : @xmath16 with ascent of star along giant branch , the mass - loss rate becomes higher and higher , which results in the higher @xmath7 .",
    "however , eq . ( [ eq : winters ] ) is valid for @xmath17 close to @xmath18 yr@xmath19 . for a mass - loss rate",
    "higher than @xmath18 yr@xmath19 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : winters ] ) gives too high @xmath7 .",
    "based on the models of @xcite , we assume @xmath20 if @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 :  the critical ignition mass of the nova depends mainly on the mass of accreting wd , its temperature and material accreting rate . following @xcite , we use @xmath8s by eq .",
    "( a1 ) of @xcite and eq .",
    "( 16 ) of @xcite .",
    "as far as whole populations of syss are considered , the former gives lower @xmath22 than the latter @xcite .",
    "4.mm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      @xcite explained super - soft x - ray emissions by steady nuclear burning of hydrogen accreted onto wd .",
    "most of the known syss are sufficiently bright x - ray sources . as mentioned in introduction , @xcite divided x - ray sources into ssss , sss and relatively hard x - ray resources .",
    "it is well known that the ssss in syss are hot wds whose photospheres can produce sufficiently hard ( @xmath23kev ) photons . for sss in syss , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggested that they originate from the collision of two stellar winds . during some strong thermonuclear runaways ,",
    "wd can eject some materials with high velocity ( @xmath0 1000 km s@xmath19 ) .",
    "cool giant usually has a high mass - loss rate with a low velocity ( 530 km s@xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore , a violent collision of the stellar winds is unavoidable in the strong thermonuclear runaways of syss .",
    "an eruption of the recurrent nova rs oph on february 12 , 2006 provided the opportunity to perform comprehensive x - ray observations .",
    "@xcite showed its x - ray spectroscopy from 0.33 to 10 kev .",
    "the spectra indicated a collisionally dominated plasma with a broad range of temperature and an energy - dependent velocity structure . @xcite and @xcite suggested that most of the early x - ray emission of the 2006 outburst of rs oph originates from the interaction between the high - velocity ejecta from wd and the circumstellar medium which results mainly from the stellar wind of the cool giant in sys .",
    "the high - velocity ejecta is a key factor for producing soft x - ray emissions in syss .",
    "according to @xcite , @xcite divided the thermonuclear runaways in syss into two varieties : weak symbiotic nova in which most of the accreted mater is deposited at the surface of the wd accretors ; strong symbiotic nova in which wd accretors eject the majority of the accreted mater via high velocity wind .",
    "we assume sss in syss stem from the strong symbiotic novae , and the steady hydrogen burning ` ordinary ' syss and weak symbiotic novae result in ssss .    the strength of a thermonuclear runaway depends on the mass and the mass accretion rate of the wd . using the results in @xcite , @xcite roughly defined the boundary between strong and weak symbiotic nova via the mass accretion rate and the mass of wd .",
    "we adopt the descriptions in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we take the time which takes the wd to decline by 3 mag in its bolometric luminosity , @xmath24 , as the lifetime of ssss . for sss which originate from the interaction between the high - velocity ejecta from wd and the circumstellar medium ,",
    "we take the duration of mass loss during strong symbiotic nova , @xmath25 , as the their lifetime .",
    "one should note that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are only a zero - order approximation . by a bilinear interpolation @xcite of table 3 in @xcite , @xmath24 and @xmath26",
    "are calculated from the models in which the temperature of wd equals @xmath27 k. if the mass or the mass accretion rate of the wd in sss are not in the range of the bilinear interpolation , they are taken as the most vicinal those .",
    "we carry out binary population synthesis via monte carlo simulation technique in order to obtain the properties of sss and ssss population in syss . for the population synthesis of binary stars ,",
    "the main input model parameters are : ( i ) the initial mass function ( imf ) of the primaries ; ( ii ) the mass - ratio distribution of the binaries ; ( iii ) the distribution of orbital separations ; ( iv ) the eccentricity distribution ; ( v ) the metallicity @xmath28 of the binary systems .",
    "we take imf in @xcite as the primary mass distribution .",
    "the lower and the upper mass cut - offs of the primaries are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . for the mass - ratio distribution of binary systems , we consider only a constant distribution@xcite .",
    "the distribution of separations is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a random variable uniformly distributed in the range [ 0,1 ] and @xmath33 is in @xmath34 .    in our work , the metallicity @xmath28=0.02 is adopted .",
    "we assume that all binaries have initially circular orbits , and we follow the evolution of both components by bse code , including the effect of tides on binary evolution @xcite .",
    "we assume that one binary with primary mass more massive than 0.8 @xmath35 is formed annually in the galaxy to calculate the birthrate of sss and ssss in syss @xcite .",
    "we construct a set of models in which we vary different input parameters relevant to the population of ssss and sss in syss .",
    "table [ tab : case ] gives all cases considered in this work .",
    "many observational evidences showed that the terminal velocity of stellar wind @xmath7 increases when a star ascends along the agb @xcite . in this work , we take @xmath7 calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : winters ] ) as the standard terminal velocity of stellar wind .",
    "we take @xmath36 initial binary systems for each case . for every simulation with @xmath36 binaries ,",
    "the relative errors for the symbiotic systems are lower than 1% .",
    "thus , @xmath36 initial binaries appear to be an acceptable sample for our study",
    ". the main results of our study are given in table [ tab : result ] and in figures [ fig : numporb ] - [ fig : numdmdt ] .",

    "+ table [ tab : result ] gives the results of sss and ssss populations in syss which have undergone channels i , ii or iii , respectively .    in our model , sss in syss result from strong symbiotic novae .",
    "as table 2 shows , the galactic occurrence rate of sss in syss is from about 2 ( case 4 ) to 20 ( case 3 ) @xmath1 .",
    "channels i , ii and iii can produce sss . according to @xcite , the typical duration of mass loss ( @xmath25 ) for a strong outburst is about dozens of days .",
    "therefore , sss are transitory x - ray sources .",
    "ssss in syss result from weak symbiotic novae or steady hydrogen burning ` ordinary ' syss .",
    "for ssss from the former , their number is between 46 ( case 4 ) and 620 ( case 3 ) , and their occurrence rate is from 2 ( case 4 ) to 17 @xmath1 ( case 2 ) .",
    "for ssss from the latter , their formation rate [ between 0.01 ( cases 1 , 3 and 4 ) and 0.03 ( case 2 ) @xmath1 ] is very low and is not shown in table [ tab : result ] .",
    "however , the lifetime of ssss from steady hydrogen burning is very long , which results in large numbers [ between 2244 ( case 4 ) and 5537 ( case 2 ) ] . due to @xmath6-algorithm which gives wide binary separation after common envelope evolution , ssss in case 2",
    "can be produced by channel i. while , ssss in other cases do not undergo channel i.    as the above descriptions , the input physical parameters ( the algorithm of the common envelope , terminal velocity of the stellar wind @xmath7 and the critical ignition mass @xmath38 ) have great effects on the population of sss and ssss in syss . for sss , @xmath7 is a key factor , and the galactic occurrence rate of sss in case 3 are about 5 times of those in case 1 .",
    "for ssss from weak symbiotic novae , @xmath39 affects their galactic number and occurrence rate within a factor of 4 ; for ssss from ` ordinary ' syss , the algorithm of the common envelope affects their galactic number and formation rate within a factor of 2.4 . a detailed analysis for the effects of these parameters can be seen in @xcite .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the galactic numbers of syss in the cases with the same input physical parameters are 5400 in case 1 and 4300 in case 4",
    ". the number ratios of the x - ray sources including sss and ssss to syss are @xmath0 50% in case 1 and @xmath0 60% in case 4 .",
    "@xmath7 in case 3 is unfavorable for the formation of stable hydrogen burning ` ordinary ' syss @xcite , the number ratio is about 20% .",
    "@xcite found that 60% of the known galactic syss are sufficiently x - ray bright to be detected .",
    "this result is agreement with our result . on comparing our results with observations",
    ", one should note that the number of x - ray sources depends greatly on the lifetime of the thermonuclear runaways as x - ray sources .",
    "in addition , it is very difficult to detect sss and ssss .",
    "the main reason is that dominant interaction with interstellar matter for x - rays between 0.1 kev and 10 kev is photoelectric absorption , and the cross section increases rapidly at lower energies , scaling approximately as @xmath40 @xcite . according to @xcite , ssss have to be closer than @xmath0 2 kpc to the sun in order to be detected .",
    "this means that only about @xmath41 of ssss can be observed .",
    "there are 4 ssss whose distances from the sun are shorter than 2.6 kpc in @xcite . hence , the galactic number of ssss in syss is about 200 if 4 ssss in syss are a completed sample within 2.6 kpc from the sun .",
    "however , the orbital motion , the magnetic field and the gravitational influence of the companions in syss can complicate the structure of circumstellar material . the nova ejecta and winds from the cool components in syss act as shielding agents . therefore , 4 ssss are a uncompleted sample .",
    "a detailed work on x - ray spectrum absorptions by circumstellar material and interstellar medium is very difficult and beyond the scope of this work .      in this subsection ,",
    "we describe potentially observable physical quantities of ssss and sss in syss .",
    "c@c +    figure [ fig : numporb ] gives the distributions of x - ray sources in the galactic syss over orbital periods .",
    "as we can see from case 1 , ssss have periods between 100 and 100000 days .",
    "ssss from steady hydrogen burning ` ordinary ' syss and from weak symbiotic novae have strong peaks at 7000 days and 11000 days , respectively . while sss have orbital periods from 10 to 1000000 days , with a typical peak at 36000 days .",
    "according to @xcite and @xcite , syss via channel i have short orbital periods , while they via channel iii have long orbital periods . as table [ tab :",
    "result ] shows , sss can be produced via channels i , ii and iii , but ssss can be done via channels ii and iii ( except case 2 )",
    ". therefore , sss span wider range of orbital periods than ssss .",
    "c@c +    figure [ fig : nummass ] shows the distributions of numbers of the modeled x - ray sources in syss each as a function of wd mass . the distribution for case 2 is wider than that in other cases .",
    "the main reason is that @xmath6 algorithm for common envelope can form syss with low - mass wd accretors @xcite . for all models , the distributions have typical masses in the 0.5 - 0.8@xmath35 range , but the peaks of the distributions are different from each type of x - ray sources .",
    "for example , in case 1 , sss have a peak at about 0.7@xmath35 . while , ssss have a peak at about 0.6@xmath35 , which is in agreement with the results in @xcite . according to @xcite and @xcite , massive wd favors to produce strong thermonuclear outburst .",
    "@xcite gave the distribution of the measured masses of the wd in syss .",
    "the peak is at about 0.5 @xmath35 regardless of @xcite estimating low limits @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed average mass of wd in symbiotic novae systems which are sss is 0.73@xmath35 .",
    "it looks likely that wd accretors in sss have masses slightly larger than those in ssss .",
    "our results are compatible with the observations .",
    "c@c +    figure [ fig : mp ] shows the distributions of sss and ssss in case 1 , in the `` wd s mass  orbital period '' plane .",
    "the ranges of orbital periods and wd s masses in sss are wider than those in ssss .",
    "the main reason is that producing ssss needs higher mass accretion rates and the critical ignition mass @xmath22 than producing sss .",
    "as the top panel in figure [ fig : mp ] shows , the distribution in sss is cut into two regions .",
    "the low region represents these sss which have undergone channel i , while the top region is for sss which have undergone channels ii and iii .",
    "c@c +    the distributions of numbers of x - ray sources in the galactic syss over the mass accretion rate of wd , @xmath42 , is given in figure [ fig : numdmdt ] . according to our model",
    ", @xmath43 determines the strength of the hydrogen burning . for low @xmath42 ,",
    "the accreting wd experiences the strong thermonuclear outburst which results in sss .",
    "for high @xmath43 , the accreting wd can undergo stable hydrogen burning .",
    "therefore , the peaks of magnitude of @xmath42 in figure [ fig : numdmdt ] are @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46@xmath47 for sss , ssss from weak symbiotic novae and from ` ordinary ' syss , respectively . in @xcite , theoretically estimated @xmath42 of five sss is between @xmath44 and @xmath48 , which is in good agreement with our results .",
    "assuming that sss in syss result from the violent collisions of the stellar winds during strong symbiotic novae , and ssss from weak symbiotic novae or steady hydrogen burning syss , we investigate the galactic population of sss and ssss in syss .",
    "the galactic occurrence rates of sss and ssss are from @xmath0 2 to 20 @xmath1 , and @xmath0 2 to 17 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the numbers of x - ray sources in syss range from 2390 to 6120 .",
    "the percentage of the x - ray sources in all syss is between @xmath0 20% and 60% , which is in agreement with the observations .    in the present paper",
    "we do not model the x - ray spectra emissions of sss and ssss , and do not consider the interstellar medium s absorptions for x - ray spectra .",
    "our work only shows some primary results .",
    "it is necessary for a detailed model of sss and ssss to simulate x - ray spectra emissions and interstellar medium s absorptions .",
