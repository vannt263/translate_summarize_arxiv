    "since more than two decades ago , the environment - induced decoherence ( eid ) approach is considered a new orthodoxy  in the physicists community ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been fruitfully applied in many areas of physics and supplies the basis of new technological developments . in the foundations of physics community",
    ", eid has been viewed as a relevant element for the interpretation of quantum mechanics ( @xcite , @xcite ) and for the explanation of the emergence of classicality from the quantum world ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the great success of eid has given rise to the idea that decoherence necessarily requires the interaction between an open quantum system and an environment of many , potentially infinite , degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the historical roots of the decoherence program can be found in certain attempts to explain the emergence of classicality in closed systems . in turn , at present other approaches have been proposed , and in several of them the openness of the system is not an essential factor .",
    "these new approaches are usually conceived as rival to eid , or even as dealing with different physical phenomena .    on the basis of our previous works on the subject ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to supply a comprehensive presentation of a new perspective , according to which formalisms originally devised to deal just with closed or open systems can be subsumed under a closed - system approach that generalizes the traditional account of the phenomenon . with this purpose , in section ii we will briefly review the historical development of the decoherence program , and in section iii we will stress some conceptual difficulties of the eid program . in section iv we will recall the orthodox approach to decoherence , emphasizing its open - system character .",
    "section v will be devoted to introduce a closed - system perspective , and to use it to reformulate the orthodox open - system eid approach . on this basis ,",
    "in section vi we will formulate the closed - system approach from a generic viewpoint : in this framework , the account of decoherence turns out to be more general than that supplied by the orthodox open - system approach . in order to illustrate this theoretical claim , in section vii we will consider the description of the well - known spin - bath model in the context of the closed - system framework , as well as the description of a generalization of that model .",
    "this task will allow us to argue , in section viii , that decoherence is relative to the decomposition of the whole closed system into a decoherent system and its environment .",
    "on this basis , in section ix we will cast a new look at the phenomenon of decoherence by considering how the new theoretical framework dissolves the conceptual difficulties of the eid approach , and by discussing the relationship between decoherence and dissipation .",
    "section x will be devoted to describe the quantum - to - classical transition from the new closed - system approach , which will allow us to unequivocally define the realm of classicality by identifying the observables with classical - like behavior . in section",
    "xi we will compare our development with other approaches to decoherence . finally , in section xii we will resume the main results of our paper and draw our conclusions .",
    "from a historical perspective , the decoherence program finds its origin @xmath0though , of course , not under this name@xmath0 in the attempts to explain how a coherent pure state becomes a final decohered mixture with no interference terms .",
    "three general periods can be identified in the development of this program :    * * * first period ( * * closed systems ) . in the fifties and the early sixties , some authors directed their attention to the emergence of classical macroscopic features from quantum microscopic descriptions ( van kampen @xcite , van hove @xcite , @xcite , daneri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in this period ,",
    "the issue was treated in the context of the study of irreversibility and , therefore , closed systems were considered . on this basis ,",
    "the states indistinguishable from the viewpoint of certain gross  observables were described by the same coarse - grained state , whose evolution was proved to reach equilibrium in a certain relaxation time .",
    "the main problem of this period was that the relaxation times so obtained turned out to be too long to account for experimental results ( see @xcite ) . * * second period * ( open systems ) .",
    "in the seventies , the emergence of classicality begun to be conceived in terms of quantum measurement and , then , was addressed from an open - system perspective ( zeh @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . on the basis of these precedents , the eid approach was systematized and developed mainly by zurek and his collaborators in a great number of works ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "an open system is considered in interaction with its environment , and the evolution of its reduced state is studied .",
    "eid proves that , in many physical models , the interference terms of the reduced state rapidly vanish and the system decoheres in an extremely short decoherence time .",
    "this result solves the main problem of the first period ; however , the foundations of the eid program are still threatened by certain conceptual problems derived from its open - system perspective ( we will return on this point in the next section ) . * * third period * ( open and closed systems ) .",
    "although ` eid ' is still considered almost as a synonym for ` decoherence ' , in the last times other approaches have been proposed to face the conceptual difficulties of eid ( diosi @xcite , @xcite , milburn @xcite , penrose @xcite , casati and chirikov @xcite , @xcite , adler @xcite )",
    ". some of these accounts are clearly non - dissipative ( bonifacio _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , ford and oconnell @xcite , frasca @xcite , sicardi schifino _",
    "@xcite , gambini _",
    "et al_. @xcite ) , that is , not based on the dissipation of energy from the system to the environment . among them , the self - induced decoherence ( sid ) approach shows that a closed quantum system with continuous spectrum may decohere by destructive interference ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in spite of the fact that , at present , formalisms for open and closed systems coexist , in the literature both kinds of approaches",
    "are often presented as alternative scenarios for decoherence , and even as theories dealing with different physical phenomena . in the next sections we will challenge this common view by showing that the different formalisms can be understood in the context of a general closed - system framework",
    "in spite of the great success of eid , and of the fact that it is conceived as the orthodox approach for decoherence , it still has to face two conceptual difficulties .      according to eid",
    ", decoherence is a consequence of the interaction between an open system and its environment ; this process is what einselects  the quantum states that become the candidates to classical states .",
    "therefore , decoherence must always be accompanied by other manifestations of openness , such as the dissipation of energy into the environment .",
    "zurek even considers that the prejudice which seriously delayed the solution of the problem of the emergence of classicality is itself rooted in the fact that the role of the openness of the system was traditionally ignored ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if only open systems may decohere , from this perspective the issue of the emergence of classicality in closed systems , in particular , in the universe as a whole , can not even be posed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "zurek expresses the criticism to eid in the following terms : _ the universe as a whole is still a single entity with no ` outside ' environment , and , therefore , any resolution involving its division into systems is unacceptable _  ( @xcite , p.181 ) .",
    "this objection has led to the development of the non - dissipative approaches to decoherence which , for this reason , are usually viewed as alternative or rival to the eid approach .",
    "when the eid approach is applied to cosmology , the universe is split into some degrees of freedom representing the system , and the remaining degrees of freedom that are supposed to be non accessible and , therefore , play the role of the environment ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the same strategy is followed in the case of internal  environments , such as collections of phonons or other internal excitations .",
    "the possibility of internal  environments shows that eid supplies no general criterion for distinguishing between the system and its environment : the partition of the whole closed system is decided case by case , and usually depends on the previous assumption of the observables that will behave classically ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of a general criterion for deciding where to place the cut  between system and environment is a serious difficulty for an approach that insists on the essential role played by the openness of the system in the emergence of classicality .",
    "zurek recognizes this problem as a shortcoming of his proposal : _ in particular , one issue which has been often taken for granted is looming big as a foundation of the whole decoherence program .",
    "it is the question of what are the ` systems ' which play such a crucial role in all the discussions of the emergent classicality .",
    "this issue was raised earlier , but the progress to date has been slow at best _  ( @xcite , p.22 ) .    as we will see , these problems , which seem to be serious conceptual obstacles for the eid approach , loose their original strength when decoherence is understood from a new general perspective . for this purpose , in the next two sections we will begin by comparing the open - system perspective and the closed - system perspective .",
    "as it is well - known , given a closed system @xmath1 represented in the hilbert space @xmath2 , its state @xmath3 evolves according to the liouville - von neumann equation , @xmath4   $ ] ,  where @xmath5 is the system s hamiltonian . if the task is to describe the behavior of @xmath1  as a whole , there is no theoretical difference between using its state @xmath6 and using the expectation values @xmath7 of its observables @xmath8 : given the state , we can compute the expectation values of all the observables of the system , and given the expectation values of all the observables ( or of the projectors corresponding to a basis of the hilbert space ) , we can compute the system s state .",
    "therefore , in this case both descriptions are equivalent : although the state - based description is the commonly used one , all the information of physical interest is also given by the expectation values of the system s observables .",
    "if the system is composite , its initial state can be obtained as the tensor product of the states of its subsystems .",
    "for example , in the case of two subsystems @xmath9 and @xmath10 , represented in the hilbert spaces @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that @xmath13 @xmath14 , and in initial states @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , the initial state of the composite system @xmath17 is computed as @xmath18 and , conversely , the initial states of the subsystems can be obtained from the initial state of the composite system by means of the operation of partial trace:@xmath19    the question is how to describe the behavior of the subsystems _ at any time_.      the usual strategy consists in generalizing the partial trace procedure for all times by considering that the reduced states , obtained as@xmath20 are the quantum states of the subsystems @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the same sense as @xmath21 is the quantum state of the whole closed system @xmath1 ( a strategy that is at least controversial : see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; we will come back to this point below ) .",
    "however , unlike @xmath21 , the reduced states @xmath22 and @xmath23 do not always evolve according to the unitary liouville - von neumann equation : in the case of interacting subsystems , they evolve according to non - unitary master equations , whose specific forms depend on the particular features of the involved subsystems and , as a consequence , must be constructed case by case .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath24 is any observable of @xmath9 and @xmath25 is any observable of @xmath10 , the expectation values of these observables can be computed as@xmath26 in fact , the reduced state of a subsystem of a larger system is defined precisely as the density operator by means of which the expectation values of all the observables belonging to that subsystem can be computed .",
    "this means that if we focus only on , say , @xmath9 , we can rely on the description given by its reduced state @xmath22 , since it supplies all the information that we can obtain when we have experimental access only to that subsystem .",
    "therefore , analogously to the closed - system case , in this situation it is also true that there is no difference between describing the open system @xmath9 by means of its reduced state @xmath22 and describing it by means of the expectation values @xmath27 of its observables .",
    "the orthodox eid approach considers the system @xmath28 under study @xmath0represented in a hilbert space @xmath29 in interaction with an environment @xmath30 @xmath0represented in a hilbert space @xmath31 that induces decoherence .",
    "this approach is based on the analysis of the evolution of the reduced state @xmath32 of @xmath28 represented in a certain pointer  basis of @xmath33 . either by explicitly computing @xmath32 or by analyzing the master equation ,",
    "it can be determined whether , under certain conditions , the reduced state operator becomes diagonal or not in that basis .",
    "the diagonalization of its reduced state is viewed as a manifestation of the decoherence of the open system @xmath28 .",
    "the eid approach proves that , in many physical models , the non - diagonal terms of the reduced state rapidly tend to vanish after an extremely short decoherence time @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is diagonal in the pointer basis .",
    "thus , it is usually said that the system @xmath28 decoheres as a consequence of its interaction with the large number of degrees of freedom of the environment @xmath30 .",
    "we know that the state @xmath32 is a hermitian operator , so it can always be diagonalized in the smith basis .",
    "so , what is special about the state diagonalization in eid ? according to eid , the diagonalization of the state must be studied in the preferred basis  or pointer basis .",
    "pointer states have some very special proprieties namely @xcite :    1 .   they are single out by the dynamics , remaining basically unchanged and 2 .",
    "they result in the smallest entropy increase .",
    "although the open - system perspective is what underlies the usual practice in physics , it is not unavoidable .",
    "the behavior of the open subsystems can also be described from a closed - system perspective by considering the expectation values of the observables relevant in any case .",
    "for example , if we still focus only on the subsystem @xmath9 , the relevant observables @xmath37 of the whole closed system @xmath17 are those that act only on that subsystem:@xmath38 where the @xmath24 are the observables of @xmath9 , and @xmath39 is the identity of the space of observables of @xmath10 .",
    "the expectation values of these relevant observables can be computed as@xmath40 eq.([6 ] ) clearly shows that , if we want to describe only @xmath9 , its reduced state is not indispensable .",
    "the physically relevant information about that subsystem can also be obtained by studying the state @xmath21 of the whole closed system @xmath1 and its relevant observables @xmath41 .",
    "this means that there is no difference between describing the open system @xmath9 by means of its reduced state @xmath22 and describing it from a closed - system perspective by means of the expectation values of the relevant observables @xmath41 of the closed composite system @xmath1 in the state @xmath21 .",
    "although the eid approach relies on the diagonalization of the reduced state , the same phenomenon can also be described from a closed - system perspective ( we will consider the discrete case , but analogous arguments can be developed in the continuous case ) .",
    "in fact , analogously to the case of the previous subsection , if we call the whole closed system @xmath42 , represented in the hilbert space @xmath43 and whose state is @xmath44 , in this case the relevant observables of @xmath45 are of the form@xmath46 where the @xmath47 are the observables of @xmath28 , and @xmath48 is the identity of the space of observables of @xmath30 .",
    "the expectation values of these relevant observables can be computed as ( see eq.([6]))@xmath49    it is clear that the evolution of the reduced state @xmath32 ( see eq.([4 ] ) ) has its counterpart in the evolution of the expectation values : @xmath50 where the @xmath51  and the @xmath52 are the diagonal components of @xmath36 and of @xmath53 in the pointer basis , respectively .",
    "but since @xmath54 ( see eq.([8 ] ) ) , from the closed - system perspective we can study the time - evolution of the expectation value @xmath55 : if , for any @xmath56 , such a function tends to settle down , in an extremely short time , in a value @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then it can be said that @xmath60 ( see eq.([9 ] ) ) . as a consequence,@xmath61 and one can also say that the system has decohered in the pointer basis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , any expectation value @xmath62 can also be expressed as the expectation value of the corresponding relevant observable @xmath63 in a coarse - grained state @xmath64:@xmath65 the state @xmath66 can be obtained as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a normalized identity operator with coefficients @xmath69 .",
    "it is quite clear that @xmath66 is not the quantum state of the closed system @xmath45 ; nevertheless , if we trace off the degrees of freedom of the environment , we recover the diagonalized reduced state of the system : @xmath70 this means that the coarse - grained state @xmath66 supplies the same information about the open system @xmath28 as the reduced state @xmath36 , but now from the viewpoint of the closed system @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , from eq.([10 ] ) we can conclude that@xmath71    by following the eid approach , up to this point we have analyzed the case based on a particular set of relevant observables . in the next section",
    "we will see that the conception of the phenomenon of decoherence can be generalized when different sets of relevant observables are considered .",
    "as emphasized by omns @xcite , decoherence is just a particular case of the general problem of irreversibility in quantum mechanics .",
    "the problem of irreversibility can be roughly expressed in the following terms .",
    "since the quantum state @xmath72 follows an unitary evolution , it can not reach a final equilibrium state for @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , if the non - unitary evolution towards equilibrium is to be accounted for , a further element has to be added to the unitary evolution . from the most general viewpoint ,",
    "this element consists in the splitting of the maximal information about the system into a relevant part and an irrelevant part : whereas the irrelevant part is disregarded , the relevant part is retained and its evolution may reach a final equilibrium situation .",
    "this broadly expressed idea can be rephrased in operators language .",
    "the maximal information about the system is given by the set of all its potentially possible observables . by selecting a particular subset @xmath74 of this set ,",
    "we restrict the maximal information to a relevant part : the expectation values @xmath75 of the observables @xmath76 express the relevant information about the system . of course , the decision about which observables are to be considered as relevant depends on the particular purposes in each situation ; but without this restriction , irreversible evolutions can not be described .",
    "as we have said above , when eid is described from the closed - system perspective , the phenomenon can be viewed as a particular kind of time - evolution of the expectation values of certain relevant observables of the closed system @xmath45 . in that particular case ,",
    "the relevant observables are of the form @xmath77 .",
    "the question is whether that account of decoherence can be generalized ( see @xcite for detalis ) .",
    "let us begin by considering the expectation values of certain relevant observables @xmath78 , which now are not necessarily of the form @xmath77 .",
    "let us suppose that , for any @xmath56 , those expectation values tend to settle down , in an extremely short time , in a value @xmath79 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( see the analogous case in eid in eq.([10])):@xmath80 of course , the @xmath81 are not the diagonal elements of a time - independent @xmath82 , since the state @xmath44 of the closed system evolves unitarily .",
    "nevertheless , the sum of eq.([14 ] ) can also be expressed as @xmath83 where the @xmath84 can be conceived as the components of a kind of coarse - grained state @xmath85 , diagonal in a basis @xmath86 of @xmath43 , which plays the role of pointer basis . in other words , @xmath87 converges , in an extremely short time , to a value that can be computed as if the system were in a state @xmath85 represented by a diagonal density operator : @xmath88    if eq.([13 ] ) and eq.([16 ] ) are compared , it is easy to see that in both cases the expectation values of certain relevant observables of the whole closed system tend very rapidly to certain time - independent values that can be computed as expectation values of those relevant observables in a time - independent diagonal state",
    ". therefore , if eq.([13 ] ) describes decoherence , there is no reason to deny that eq.([16 ] ) is also a description of the same phenomenon .",
    "this means that , although the off - diagonal terms of @xmath44 never vanish through the unitary evolution , decoherence obtains because it is a coarse - grained process : the system decoheres from the observational viewpoint given by any observable belonging to the space @xmath74 .",
    "it might be objected that , whereas in the case of eid the time - independent diagonal state @xmath66 is defined in terms of the reduced state @xmath36 , which is the quantum state of the open system , in the general approach the time - independent diagonal @xmath85 is not the quantum state of the closed system",
    ". however , this objection is based on the assumption that the reduced state of an open system is its quantum state , a position that is seriously challenged by the difference between proper and improper mixtures ( see @xcite , @xcite ) : reduced states are improper mixtures , they are only _ a calculational tool _  for computing expectation values ( @xcite , p.48 ) . for this reason , even in the particular context of decoherence , schlosshauer warns us _ against a misinterpretation of reduced density matrices as describing a proper mixture of states _",
    "( @xcite , p.69 ; see also @xcite ) . therefore , although it is true that @xmath85 is not the state of the closed system @xmath45 but a calculational tool for computing expectation values after the extremely short decoherence time , the same can be said of the reduced state @xmath36 regarding the open system @xmath28 .",
    "it is interesting to emphasize in what sense this closed - system perspective for understanding decoherence is more general than the orthodox open - system perspective .",
    "the eid approach always selects a set of relevant observables that correspond to a subsystem , with its associated hilbert space and its reduced state . from the closed - system perspective , by contrast , the set of the relevant observables that decohere is completely generic and may not correspond to a subsystem .",
    "for example , one might be interested in the decoherence of a single observable of the closed system @xmath45 , which certainly does not define a subsystem but , nevertheless , may manifest a classical - like behavior .    summing up , the closed - system perspective has allowed us to conceptualize decoherence from a viewpoint more general than that supplied by the eid approach : decoherence induced  by the environment is a particular case of a phenomenon that involves the evolution of the expectation values of certain relevant observables towards a specific time - independent value .",
    "there are , then , certain processes that fall under the concept of decoherence from this general viewpoint , but are not conceptualized as decoherence from the eid approach . it might be thought that this is a merely semantic issue ; however , the fact that the difference has physical content will become clear when the problem of the transition from quantum to classical will be considered .",
    "in this section we will analyze the spin - bath model , both in the traditional and in the generalized versions , as presented in previous works , from the open - system approach .",
    "we will show how this model leads to conclusions that sound paradoxical when read from an open - system perspective .",
    "this is a very simple model that has been exactly solved in previous papers ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we will study it from the closed - system perspective presented in the previous section .",
    "let us consider a closed system @xmath89 , where ( i ) @xmath90 is a spin-1/2 particle represented in the hilbert space @xmath91 , and ( ii ) each @xmath81 is a spin-1/2 particle represented in its hilbert space @xmath92 .",
    "the hilbert space of the composite system is , then,@xmath93 in the particle @xmath90 , the two eigenstates of the spin operator @xmath94  in direction @xmath95 are @xmath96 and @xmath97 , such that @xmath98  and  @xmath99 . in each particle",

    "therefore , a pure initial state of @xmath45 reads@xmath105 where the coefficients @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 are such that satisfy @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "if the self - hamiltonians @xmath112 of @xmath90 and @xmath113 of @xmath81 are taken to be zero , and there is no interaction among the @xmath81 , then the total hamiltonian @xmath5 of the composite system is given by the interaction between the particle @xmath90 and each particle @xmath81 .",
    "for instance ( see @xcite ) , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the identity operator on the subspace @xmath116 and the @xmath117 are the coupling constants .      in the typical situation studied by the eid approach ,",
    "the open system @xmath28 is the particle @xmath90 and the remaining particles @xmath81 play the role of the environment @xmath30 : @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",

    "this result is not surprising , but completely reasonable from a physical point of view .",
    "in fact , with the exception of the particle @xmath90 , the remaining particles of the environment @xmath30 are uncoupled to each other : each @xmath81 evolves as a free system and , as a consequence , @xmath30 is unable to reach a final stable state .",

    "it is on the basis of this closed - system perspective that a different conceptual viewpoint for understanding decoherence can be developed .",
    "from the closed - system perspective introduced in the previous sections , the discrimination between system and environment turns out to be the selection of the relevant observables . by following harshman and wickramasekara ( @xcite )",

    "since the tps is defined by the spaces of observables @xmath210 and @xmath211 , the decomposition of @xmath45 is just the adoption of a descriptive perspective : the identification of @xmath28 and @xmath30 amounts to the selection of the relevant observables in each situation .",
    "but since the split can be performed in many ways , with no privileged decomposition , there is no need of an unequivocal criterion for deciding where to place the cut between the  system and the  environment .",
    "decoherence is not a yes - or - no process , but a phenomenon _ relative _ to the chosen decomposition of the whole closed quantum system .    from this perspective , the perplexities derived from the generalized spin - bath model vanish .",
    "in fact , when we consider the whole closed system @xmath45 , there is no difficulty in saying that from the viewpoint of the space of observables , say @xmath215 , ( corresponding to the particle @xmath216 ) there is decoherence , but from the viewpoint of the space of observables @xmath210 ( corresponding to the open subsystem @xmath182 ) there is no decoherence .",
    "moreover , even if there is decoherence from the viewpoint of all the @xmath217 , this does not imply decoherence from the viewpoint of @xmath210 since , as it is well - known , @xmath210 is not the mere union of the @xmath218 . in other words , in agreement with quantum holism , the open subsystem @xmath137 is not the mere collection of the particles @xmath139 ; then , it is reasonable to expect that the behavior of @xmath137 can not be inferred from the behavior of all the @xmath139 . in the same sense",
    ", it is not surprising that there is no decoherence from the viewpoint of the total space of observables @xmath219 of @xmath45 , in spite of the fact that there is decoherence from the viewpoint of anyone of the @xmath217 and @xmath220 , corresponding to the particles @xmath139 and @xmath146 respectively . and since the privileged viewpoint does not exist , the conclusions about decoherence have to be relativized to the particular observational perspective selected in each case .",
    "when decoherence is understood in the new general framework , the conceptual difficulties of the eid program turn out to be not as serious as originally supposed .",
    "in fact :    1 .   with respect to the open - system  problem",
    ", it does not make sense to say that closed quantum systems may not decohere : a closed quantum system may decohere from certain observational perspectives , that is , from the viewpoint of certain spaces of observables .",
    "furthermore , in spite of the fact that eid focuses on open systems , it can also be formulated from the perspective of the composite closed system and , in this case , meaningful relationships between the behavior of the whole system and the behavior of its subsystems can be explained ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the defining systems  problem is simply dissolved by the fact that the splitting of the closed system into an open subsystem and an environment is just a way of selecting the relevant observables of the closed system .",
    "since there are many different sets of relevant observables depending on the observational viewpoint adopted , the same closed system can be decomposed in many different ways : each decomposition represents a decision about which degrees of freedom are relevant and which can be disregarded in any case . since there is no privileged or essential  decomposition ,",
    "there is no need of an unequivocal criterion for deciding where to place the cut between the  system and the  environment . as said above , decoherence is not a yes - or - no process , but a phenomenon relative to the chosen decomposition .",
    "therefore , zurek s looming big problem  is not a real threat to the eid approach : the supposed challenge dissolves once the relative nature of decoherence is taken into account ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although the new framework neutralizes the conceptual difficulties of the eid approach , also points to some warnings about the way in which the proposal is usually presented . from the new perspective",
    ", the insistence on the essential role played by the openness of a system and its interaction with the environment in the phenomenon of decoherence sounds rather misleading .",
    "the essential physical fact is that , among all the observational viewpoints that may be adopted to study a closed system , some of them determine a subset of relevant observables for which the system decoheres .      as pointed out in section",
    "ii , certain presentations of the eid approach suggest the existence of a certain relationship between decoherence and dissipation , as if decoherence were a physical consequence of or , at least , were strongly linked to energy dissipation .",
    "some particular models studied in the literature on the subject tend to reinforce this idea by describing the behavior of a small open system @xmath0typically , a particle@xmath0 immersed in a large environmental bath . on this basis",
    ", the eid approach has been considered a dissipative  approach , by contrast to non - dissipative  accounts of decoherence that constitute the heterodoxy  in the field ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that energy dissipation is not a condition for decoherence has been clearly emphasized by schlosshauer , who claims that _ decoherence may , but does not have to , be accompanied by dissipation , whereas the presence of dissipation also implies the occurrence of decoherence _  ( @xcite , p.93 ) .",
    "this fact is explained by stressing that the loss of energy from the system is a classical effect , leading to thermal equilibrium in the relaxation time , whereas decoherence is a pure quantum effect that takes place in the decoherence time , many orders of magnitude shorter than the relaxation time : _ if dissipation and decoherence are both present , they are usually quite easily distinguished because of their very different timescales _  ( @xcite , p.93 ) . according to the author , it is this crucial difference between relaxation and decoherence timescales that explains why we observe macroscopic objects to follow newtonian trajectories @xmath0effectively created  through the action of decoherence@xmath0 with no manifestation of energy dissipation , such as a slowing - down of the object .",
    "schlosshauer recalls an example used by joos ( @xcite ) : the planet jupiter has been revolving around the sun on a newtonian trajectory for billions of years , while its motional state has remained virtually unaffected by any dissipative loss .    this explanation ,",
    "although correctly stressing the difference between decoherence and dissipation , seems to present both phenomena on the same footing : an open system would first become classical through decoherence , and would then relax due to energy dissipation .",
    "following this view , dissipation involves the loss of energy from the system to the environment , while decoherence amounts to a sort of dissipation  of coherence that leads the open system , in a very short time , to the classical regime : the environment plays the role of a sink  that carries away the information about the system ( @xcite , p.85 ) .",
    "the results obtained in the generalized spin - bath model show that the coherence - dissipation or information - dissipation picture has to be considered with great caution , as a mere metaphor .",
    "in fact , to the extent that decoherence is a relative phenomenon , no flow of a non - relative quantity from the open system to the environment can account for decoherence .",
    "in particular , although energy dissipation and decoherence are in general easily distinguished because of their different timescales , the very reason for their difference is that energy dissipation is not a relative phenomenon but results from the effective flow of a physical entity , whereas decoherence is relative to the observational partition of the whole closed system selected in each situation . on the other hand , decoherence can be explained in terms of the flow of information from the open system to the environment if information is also conceived as a relative magnitude ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as it is well known , one of the main aims of the decoherence program is to explain _ the transition from quantum to classical _  ( @xcite , p.36 ) . for this purpose",
    ", it is expected that the phenomenon of decoherence cancels the quantum features that preclude classicality . in this section",
    "we will see how this may happen .",
    "let us begin by recalling that , in the quantum domain , the expectation values are the experimentally accessible magnitudes : we do not measure states but expectation values .",
    "therefore , the purpose must be to obtain quantum expectation values with a classical - like form .",
    "the expectation value of a classical observable @xmath221 , whose possible values are @xmath222 , is computed as @xmath223 where @xmath81 is the probability corresponding to the value @xmath222 . in quantum mechanics , by contrast , the expectation value of an observable @xmath221 in the state @xmath224 is computed as @xmath225 where the @xmath226 and the @xmath227 are the components of @xmath221 and @xmath224 in a given basis .",
    "it is important to note that in this approach , the terms of the mean values must be written in the same preferred basis of eid ( however it is also possible to define the baseline from the mean values @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , if the purpose is that quantum expectation values behave as in the classical case , we need to identify the situation in which they acquire a form that resembles the classical one , that is , a situation in which the non - diagonal  sum @xmath228 vanishes and only the diagonal  sum @xmath229 remains .",
    "since the non - diagonal terms of a quantum state do not have a classical analogue , in the eid approach the diagonalization of the reduced state of the system is viewed as a manifestation of the quantum - to - classical transition : the states of the pointer basis , einselected  by decoherence , are the candidates to classical states ( strictly speaking , in order to obtain a classical - like description it is necessary to apply the wigner transformation and the limit @xmath230 , see @xcite ) . in most models ,",
    "the system is a particle and , as a consequence , it is usually said that the particle becomes @xmath0or , at least , begins to behave as if it were@xmath0 classical .",
    "in fact , the diagonalization of the reduced state @xmath32 of @xmath28 in the pointer basis leads to a situation in which certain expectation values acquire a classical - like form .",
    "since @xmath36 is diagonal , it can be conceived as representing a classical - like probability that makes the interference terms represented by @xmath228 to be zero ( see eq.([9 ] ) ) : @xmath231 as a consequence , the expectation value of any observable @xmath232 of @xmath28 that is diagonal in the pointer basis ( the same of eid ) will have the classical form of eq.([37 ] ) : @xmath233 where the diagonal components @xmath234 of @xmath36 play the role of the classical - like probabilities corresponding to the possible values @xmath0eigenvalues@xmath0 @xmath235 of the observable @xmath232 .    in summary ,",
    "the decoherence of the observables corresponding to the system @xmath28 selects the pointer basis in which the reduced state @xmath32 becomes diagonal after the decoherence time and , in turn , that pointer basis identifies the observables of @xmath28 whose expectation values acquire a classical form . as a consequence , instead of saying that the system @xmath28 behaves as if it were classical or that the states of the pointer basis become classical , it would be more accurate to say that _ the observables _",
    "@xmath232 of @xmath28 behave as if they were classical observables . moreover , on the basis of the arguments of the previous sections , from the closed - system perspective one could also say that the observables @xmath236 of the whole closed system @xmath42 behave as if they were classical observables .",
    "as we have said in section vi , from our viewpoint decoherence is a process that leads @xmath55 to converge , in an extremely short time , to a value that can be computed as if the system were in a state represented by a diagonal density operator ( see eq.([16 ] ) ) : @xmath237 now @xmath0analogously to the eid case@xmath0 the expectation value of any observable @xmath238 of @xmath45  that is diagonal in the pointer basis will have the classical form of eq.([37 ] ) : @xmath239 where the diagonal components @xmath84 of @xmath85 play the role of the classical - like probabilities corresponding to the possible values @xmath0eigenvalues@xmath0 @xmath240 of the observable @xmath238 .    in complete analogy with the quantum - to - classical transition in eid , here",
    "the decoherence of the relevant observables of @xmath45 selects the pointer basis in which the state @xmath85 is diagonal and , in turn , this pointer basis identifies , among all the relevant observables , those whose expectation values acquire a classical form . but in this case , the relevant observables do not need to correspond to a subsystem of @xmath45 : it is possible to focus attention on any group of observables of the closed system , or even on a single observable , in order to know if they behave in a classical - like manner .",
    "since according to the eid approach only open systems may decohere , from this perspective the issue of the emergence of classicality in closed systems , in particular , in the universe as a whole , can not even be posed since _ the state of a perfectly isolated fragment of the universe _",
    "@xmath0__of , for that matter , of the quantum universe as a whole__@xmath0 _ _  would evolve forever deterministically _ _",
    "( @xcite , p.181 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this difficulty can be overcome from the closed - system perspective .",
    "in fact , once the idea of the decoherence and the classicality of systems or states is replaced by the view that certain observables decohere and may acquire a classical - like behavior , the restriction to open systems loses its strength .",
    "moreover , the perplexities resulting from the generalized spin - bath model can also be solved .",
    "in fact , they derive from supposing that the open subsystems become classical when interacting with their environments . from the open - system perspective , on the contrary , one can univocally identify , among all the observables of the closed system , which acquire a classical - like behavior : the classical world  is unambiguously defined by the set observables whose expectation values acquire a classical form .",
    "current works indicate that the most suitable scenario for early cosmology is the one of inflation @xcite .",
    "this is because the whole structure of the universe can be traced to the primordial fluctuations during an accelerated phase of the early universe .",
    "several works show that eid can solve the quantum - classical transition of the universe , by separating the different degrees of freedom in system and environment .",
    "since there is no a standard way to divide the universe , some authors take the inflaton as a system and the gravitons as the environment @xcite , while other authors divide the universe between long and short frequencies @xcite .",
    "however there is an alternative approach proposed by kiefer , polarski and starobinsky @xcite , it studies the problem of quantum - classical transition without the need to attend to decoherence .",
    "the predictions obtained through mean values are indistinguishable from stochastic averaging .    according to paper @xcite",

    "if we compute the time evolution in the heisenberg representation we have that the following : @xmath257 where @xmath258 and the modes @xmath259 satisfy the equation @xmath260 we can write the equation ( [ dsd11 ] ) in a more suggestive way @xmath261 where @xmath262 and @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 . analogously @xmath266      this formulation is relevant to understand the quantum - classical transition .",

    "; when this mode is neglected we are in the limit of a random stochastic process .",
    "kiefer and polarski present their explanation of the quantum - classical transition of the universe as a pragmatic view .",
    "this is because although we can obtain classical statistics from quantum statistics , there is not an associated interpretation .",
    "the main characteristic of the pragmatic view  is that it focuses on the mean values and it does not use any reduced state .",
    "most interpretations of quantum mechanics emphasize the quantum state , assigning to it some kind of ontology .",
    "in fact , in eid the focus is in the reduced state . for this reason",
    "the authors believe that their point of view , that does not consider the states , is simply a pragmatic view . and to understand the phenomenon is necessary to introduce eid",
    ".    however , we believe that this formalism can be given in a proper interpretive framework that does not consider to the state , then eid is not necessary    the pragmatic view basically consists of studying the mean values directly , without taking into account the state , and it determines when these values do take the form of classical statistics and when they do not .",
    "this way of studying decoherence is similar to the approach proposed by the closed - system perspective .",
    "as it is known , a quantum system evolves under the schrdinger equation .",
    "as the evolution is unitary , the system can not reach equilibrium or decoherence .    as explained in previous sections , if we choose appropriate relevant observables we can describe the phenomenon of decoherence in the mean values of the closed system .",
    "therefore , the quantum - classical transition of the pragmatic view  has to ignore some kind of decoherence .",
    "this is difficult to determine if the decoherence is understood from the point of view of eid , since it divided the whole system into the system and the environment , computes the reduced state of the system and considers its diagonalization .",
    "however , according to the closed - system perspective , decoherence is understood as the vanish of the interference terms in the mean values , then the problem is simplified .",
    "in fact , the pragmatic view selects the observable ad ignores evanescent modes .",

    "we have analyzed the spin - bath model , both in its traditional and in a generalized version : by considering different partitions of the whole closed system in both cases , we have shown that decoherence depends on the way in which the relevant observables are selected .",

    "<S> the aim of this paper is to review a new perspective about decoherence , according to which formalisms originally devised to deal just with closed or open systems can be subsumed under a closed - system approach that generalizes the traditional account of the phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> this new viewpoint dissolves certain conceptual difficulties of the orthodox open - system approach but , at the same time , shows that the openness of the quantum system is not the essential ingredient for decoherence , as commonly claimed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , when the behavior of a decoherent system is described from a closed - system perspective , the account of decoherence turns out to be more general than that supplied by the open - system approach , and the quantum - to - classical transition defines unequivocally the realm of classicality by identifying the observables with classical - like behavior . </S>"
