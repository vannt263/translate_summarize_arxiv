    "due to the incessant presence of the strong interaction , the hadronic weak interaction in the quark flavour conserving sector of the standard model is not completely understood .",
    "even though the weak interaction between quarks is well known at high energies , its properties are hard to extract in the nonperturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "this is due to the complicated structure of nuclear systems along with coinciding dynamics of qcd .",
    "it seems an almost hopeless challenge to distinguish directly about the size of seven orders of magnitude smaller weak interaction effects from those of qcd .",
    "fortunately , the weak interaction leaves a unique signature in the form of parity nonconservation ( pnc ) , which provides a tiny but non - vanishing observable .    for the past three decades the pnc calculations between nucleons",
    "have been based on the use of the ddh @xcite potential .",
    "unfortunately , the potential requires the knowledge of several weak meson - nucleon coupling constants , which are still to date inadequately known . today s contemporary attempts to determine pnc amplitudes more and more often harness qcd based chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath5pt ) . unlike the phenomenological meson - exchange model , @xmath5pt provides a systematic and model - independent way to study hadronic reactions at low energies .",
    "the updated @xmath5pt based approach leads to a systematic expansion of pnc amplitudes in terms of low - energy constants ( lecs ) which have a straightforward correspondence with the weak ddh meson - nucleon couplings , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite .    out of all the possible candidates for asymmetry and polarization observables , in this paper",
    "we focus on the asymmetries associated with pnc deuteron photodisintegration by circularly polarized photons @xmath0 and thermal polarized neutron capture @xmath1 .",
    "it is further to be noted that the photon polarization of @xmath6 at threshold equals the photon asymmetry of the time - reversed reaction @xmath0 at threshold .",
    "the threshold behaviour of the asymmetry / polarization in reactions @xmath7 can be shown to be insensitive to the @xmath8-meson exchange , which represents the long - range @xmath9 part of the pnc interaction .",
    "therefore , the threshold region is essentially dominated by the exchanges of heavy mesons ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and thus also the relatively long - ranged @xmath12-excitation could occur more clearly highlighted than what it would if it appeared in a background where the pion is more intensely present .",
    "to our knowledge this effect has only been checked in the form of exchange currents in refs.@xcite .",
    "contrary to the reactions @xmath7 at the threshold , the pnc @xmath8-exchange is predominant in the low - energy reaction @xmath1 .",
    "there are various theoretical works on the pnc reactions @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite , and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the calculations are typically carried out exploiting the old meson - exchange picture , aside from some of the recent works , which apply the modern state - of - art techniques , _",
    "e.g. _ such as the pionless effective field theory eft(@xmath13 ) and heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory hb@xmath5pt .",
    "the results more or less agree in the threshold region .",
    "the energy regime of several mev above the threshold of the deuteron photodisintegration is investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . again , in that regime , the results are similar except in ref .",
    "@xcite , which differs by an exceptionally large pion contribution .",
    "the difference is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "up to date , for the reaction @xmath0 , there exist only two experimental data points : @xmath14 and @xmath15 at the photon energies of 3.2 and 4.1 mev respectively @xcite .",
    "the latest photon polarization measurement for the inverse reaction @xmath6 gives the value of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the data from the 1980 s for both the reactions are consistent with zero with rather a poor precision and , therefore , new and more accurate experimental data , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , would be appreciated .",
    "the asymmetry of the reaction @xmath1 was also measured previously in the 70 s and 80 s , resulting in the insufficiently accurate values of @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite . however , there is currently an ongoing experiment ( npdgamma ) on the reaction @xmath1 with cold neutrons at lansce and sns with a preliminary result , which sets the asymmetry within the limits of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the oncoming measurements of the npdgamma experiment aim to improve the accuracy up to a level of 20% of the typical theoretical prediction @xmath20 , which employs the ddh `` best value '' for the weak @xmath21 coupling constant @xmath22 .",
    "the asymmetry is straightforwardly proportional to the @xmath22 and therefore the current experiment is about to shed some light on the uncertain value of the coupling .    in this paper",
    "we study pnc in the above reactions using two modern phenomenological strong potentials and post - ddh weak couplings .",
    "furthermore , we want to estimate the size of the aforementioned @xmath12 effect , which was found to be significant in pnc elastic @xmath23 scattering at higher energies @xcite . as in these",
    "works our calculation is carried out within the framework of the coupled channels meson - exchange model and hence , according to the common practice , we utilize the ddh potential @xcite as the starting point for the pnc @xmath8- , @xmath11- , and @xmath10-exchanges extending to use the weak couplings of ref .",
    "@xcite consistent with the presence of the @xmath12 .",
