    "turbulent plane channel flow subject to rotation about the spanwise direction displays several phenomena of interest to engineering applications and turbulence modelling ( jakirli 2002 ) .",
    "effects of rotation on flow and turbulence are in this case non - trivial .",
    "channel flow is unaffected by rotation if fluid motions are two - dimensional and perpendicular to the rotation axis ( tritton 1992 ) , for example , laminar poiseuille flow and waves perpendicular to the rotation axis are not influenced ( brethouwer 2014 ) . yet , it is well - established that spanwise rotation strongly influences reynolds stresses , anisotropy and structures , and the mean velocity profile in plane turbulent channel flow ( johnston 1972 ) .",
    "rotation effects are therefore obviously related to three - dimensional turbulent processes .",
    "a useful parameter when discussing rotation effects on turbulent shear flows is the ratio of background and mean shear vorticity . for a unidirectional shear flow with mean velocity @xmath9 in the @xmath10-direction and shear vorticity @xmath11 rotating with angular velocity @xmath5 about the @xmath12-axis",
    ", this ratio is given by @xmath13 when @xmath14 the mean shear and background vorticity have the same sense of rotation and rotation is cyclonic and when @xmath15 they have the opposite sense and rotation is anti - cyclonic .",
    "simple theoretical considerations ( tritton 1992 ) and rapid distortion theory as well as direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of rotating homogeneous turbulent shear flow demonstrate that turbulence is damped if @xmath16 and @xmath17 and augmented if @xmath18 ( brethouwer 2005 )",
    ".    experiments of fully developed turbulent plane channel flow subject to spanwise rotation by johnston ( 1972 ) at @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and by nakabayashi & kitoh ( 2005 ) at @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath3 is the bulk mean velocity , @xmath4 channel half - width , @xmath25 viscosity and @xmath5 rotation rate , have shown that turbulence is suppressed on one side of the channel where @xmath16 and augmented on the other side where @xmath18 , in accordance with the discussion above .",
    "these sides are from now on called the stable and unstable side , respectively .",
    "dns of spanwise rotating channel flow by kristoffersen & andersson ( 1993 ) at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , lamballais ( 1996 ) at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , nagano & hattori ( 2003 ) at @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and liu & lu ( 2006 ) at @xmath26 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are based on the friction velocity instead of @xmath3 , were consistent with the experimental observations . at sufficiently high @xmath8 the suppression of turbulence is so strong that the flow becomes laminar - like on the stable side .",
    "the asymmetry of the reynolds stresses induces a skewed mean velocity profile and differences in the shear stresses on the two walls .",
    "another notable feature is the appearance of a region in the channel where the mean velocity profile is linear with a slope @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 , implying that the absolute mean vorticity is nearly zero .",
    "spanwise rotation affects turbulence anisotropy too since wall - normal fluctuations are typically strongly augmented on the unstable side ( kristoffersen & andersson 1993 ) , again in line with dns of rotating homogeneous shear flow ( brethouwer 2005 ) .",
    "another consequence of spanwise system rotation is the emergence of large streamwise roll cells at certain @xmath8 , as indicated by experiments and dns ( johnston 1972 , kristoffersen & andersson 1993 ) .",
    "higher @xmath8 was considered by grundestam ( 2008 ) , who performed dns of spanwise rotating channel flow at @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "besides one - point statistics , they studied the effect of rotation on turbulent structures and reynolds stress budgets .",
    "they observed that at higher @xmath8 turbulence was weak as well on the unstable side , suggesting that the flow fully relaminarizes at sufficiently high @xmath8 .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that in poiseuille flow @xmath39 and @xmath40 everywhere in the channel if @xmath41 .",
    "a more rigorous stability analysis shows that all modes with spanwise wavenumber @xmath42 are linearly stable for @xmath43 in plane poiseuille flow with spanwise rotation ( wallin 2013 ) .",
    "the critical rotation number @xmath44 is a monotonic function of @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "dns confirms that the flow relaminarizes when @xmath49 ( wallin 2013 ) .",
    "however , tollmien - schlichting ( ts ) waves with a wave vector normal to the rotation axis are unaffected by spanwise rotation and become linearly unstable in plane poiseuille flow if @xmath50 ( schmid & henningson 2001 ) .",
    "dns indeed reveal ts wave instabilities resulting in a continuous cycle of turbulent bursts if @xmath51 and the flow is basically laminar ( wallin 2013 ) .",
    "absence of turbulence though is not a prerequisite for ts instabilities , as shown by brethouwer ( 2014 ) who have observed cyclic bursts of intense turbulence triggered by an unstable ts wave in dns at @xmath52 and @xmath53 when turbulence is strong on the unstable side .",
    "an extensive study of dnss of spanwise rotating channel flow reveals that these cyclic turbulent bursts and ts wave instabilities show up in a quite wide range of @xmath6 and @xmath8 including cases with overall weak turbulence as well as strong continuous turbulence on the unstable side ( brethouwer 2016 ) .",
    "the observed ts instability growth was compared with linear stability theory predictions and analyzed in detail .",
    "a further study of spanwise rotating channel flow was done by yang & wu ( 2012 ) .",
    "they carried out dnss at @xmath37 and applied a helical wave decomposition .",
    "this shows that at low @xmath8 energy concentrates in large modes , which may be linked to the formation of roll cells , while at higher @xmath8 energy accumulates at smaller scales .",
    "dnss at @xmath37 and a wide range of @xmath8 were also performed by xia ( 2016 ) .",
    "they studied various one - point statistics and observed a linear part in the profile of the streamwise reynolds stress production at sufficiently high @xmath8 .",
    "the previous studies of spanwise rotating channel flow were mostly limited to low reynolds numbers , @xmath54 , meaning that the influence of the reynolds number on the statistics , turbulent structures and relaminarization on the stable side can be significant .",
    "an exception to these studies is the experiments of johnston ( 1972 ) at somewhat higher @xmath6 albeit limited to low @xmath8 .",
    "i have carried out dnss of plane turbulent channel flow subject to spanwise rotation at low as well as higher @xmath6 and with larger computational domains than in the aforementioned numerical studies and for a wide range of @xmath8 .",
    "the aims of the my study are to determine if the effects of rotation on turbulence discussed above are generic , i.e. also observed at higher @xmath6 , to examine the influence of @xmath6 , and to further investigate the influence of rotation on turbulence structures and reynolds stress budgets .",
    "moreover , data of rotating channel flow at higher @xmath6 are important for turbulence modelling .",
    "the velocity @xmath55 in the dnss is governed by the incompressible navier - stokes equations @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the unit vector in the @xmath12-direction and @xmath58 the pressure including the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "the equations are nondimensionalized by the mean bulk velocity @xmath3 and channel half gap @xmath4 ; time @xmath59 is thus given in terms of a convection time @xmath60 .",
    "streamwise , wall - normal , spanwise coordinates are denoted by @xmath10 , @xmath61 , @xmath12 , respectively , and boundary conditions are periodic in the streamwise and spanwise directions and no - slip at the walls .",
    "a sketch of the geometry is shown in brethouwer ( 2016 ) . in the present dnss @xmath62 and 1 correspond to the wall on the unstable and stable channel side , respectively .",
    "equations ( [ gov_eq ] ) are solved with a pseudo - spectral code with fourier expansions in the homogeneous @xmath10- and @xmath12-direction and chebyshev polynomials in the @xmath61-direction ( chevalier 2007 ) and the spatial resolution is similar as in previous channel flow dnss ( lee & moser 2015 ) . in all runs the flow rate and thus @xmath6 was kept constant by adapting the mean pressure gradient .",
    "@xmath6 is varied from 5000 up to 31600 and @xmath8 from 0 ( nonrotating ) to about @xmath44 which is between 2.67 to 2.87 for this range of @xmath6 . in most dnss ,",
    "the streamwise and spanwise domain size are either @xmath63 or @xmath64 , but in some dnss the domain size was chosen differently to accommodate ts instabilities , as explained in brethouwer ( 2016 ) , but this variation has little effect on results presented here .",
    "the runs are sufficiently long to reach a statistically stationary state in all dnss .",
    "parameters of the dnss at @xmath65 to @xmath1 are listed in table [ sim_par ] .",
    "the friction velocity is calculated as @xmath66^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the friction velocity of unstable and stable channel side , respectively ( grundestam 2008 ) . @xmath69 and @xmath70 are reynolds numbers based on @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . with this definition the mean dimensional pressure gradient @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the fluid density .",
    "the dnss studied here are basically the same as those in brethouwer ( 2016 ) .",
    ".dns parameters : @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the number of modes in the streamwise , wall - normal and spanwise direction , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 , are the streamwise and spanwise computational domain size , respectively .",

    "the present numerical study of fully developed plane turbulent channel flow subject to system rotation about the spanwise direction covers a wide range of parameters with @xmath6 between 5000 and @xmath1 and @xmath8 between 0 and 2.7 . at all",
    "@xmath6 and for a wide range of @xmath8 the mean streamwise velocity profile has a linear part with a slope @xmath120 implying that this characteristic is independent of the reynolds number .",
    "profiles of the production and dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy and some of the budget terms in the reynolds stress equations show , as a consequence , a linear part as well . considering the production and coriolis term together",
    ", we can observe that in this part of the unstable channel side , basically all energy is fed into the wall - normal @xmath121 component .",
    "the energy is then redistributed to the streamwise and especially the spanwise reynolds stress component through pressure - strain correlations .    by means of visualizations and one - dimensional",
    "spectra i have investigated the influence on rotation on turbulence structures . a distinct unstable side with intense turbulence and vortical structures and a stable side with much weaker turbulence develops in the channel with an apparent sharp border between the two sides .",
    "if @xmath8 approaches 0.45 we can observe that the flow at higher @xmath6 partly relaminarizes on the stable side of the channel and that oblique turbulent - laminar patterns develop which resemble the oblique band - like structures found in transitional couette and channel flows at low reynolds numbers ( duguet 2010 , tuckerman 2014 ) .",
    "it is somewhat remarkable that such patterns exist in rotating channel flow at a significantly higher @xmath6 .",
    "the study by brethouwer ( 2012 ) suggests that turbulent - laminar patterns similar to those found in my dns at @xmath82 and @xmath79 to @xmath1 also exist at lower @xmath6 but at a lower @xmath8 and that the patterns most likely have a longer wave length at lower @xmath6 . in other words",
    ", the patterns could appear at low @xmath6 in dnss of rotating channel flow if much larger computational domains are used than in previous studies .",
    "if @xmath8 is raised further in the present dnss the turbulent fraction of the flow on the stable side goes down and eventually the flow relaminarizes there .",
    "the unstable side with strong turbulence diminishes in size with @xmath8 and when the rotation rate is sufficiently high the whole flow becomes laminar .",
    "however , as shown by brethouwer ( 2016 ) , a linear instability can develop in rapidly rotating channel flows causing a continuous cycle of turbulent bursts .    on the unstable side of the channel , large counter - rotating streamwise roll cells",
    "are observed at low @xmath8 .",
    "the spectra and visualizations show that the roll cells become smaller and less noticeable and eventually disappear if @xmath8 is raised .",
    "this trend seems to be stronger at higher @xmath6 since the present and previous studies indicate that at low @xmath6 roll cells persist at higher @xmath8 ( grundestam 2008 ) .",
    "large - scale structures are present on the unstable side if @xmath8 is low , but they become less energetic at higher @xmath8 .    the influence of @xmath6 is also investigated and found to be significant . at fixed @xmath8 reynolds stresses are noticeable stronger on the stable side of the channel at higher @xmath6 , at least if @xmath82 or 0.9 .",
    "whereas turbulent - laminar patterns are found on the stable side at @xmath82 if @xmath122 they are not observed at the same @xmath8 at lower @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "roll cells appear to be more prominent on the unstable side of rotating channel flow if @xmath6 is lower .",
