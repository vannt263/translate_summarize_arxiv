    "the discovery of quantum hall effects spurred a tremendous research interest in the quantum phenomena associated with the systems of lower dimensions such as quantum wells , quantum wires , and quantum dots . while this momentum still seems to be growing [ 1 ] , the classical phenomena emerged with the proposal of the photonic ( and phononic ) crystals and , more recently , the negative - index metamaterials have been drawing considerable attention of many research groups world - wide . proposed some four decades ago by veselago [ 2 ] , advocated by sir john pendry in 2000 [ 3 ] , and first practically realized by smith and coworkers in 2001 [ 4 ] , an artificially designed negative - index metamaterial , exhibiting simultaneously negative values of electrical permittivity @xmath5 and magnetic permeability @xmath6 and hence negative refractive index @xmath7 , seems to have changed many basic notions related with the electromagnetism .",
    "it forms a left - handed medium , with the energy flow @xmath8 being opposite to the direction of propagation , for which it has been argued that such phenomena as snell s law , doppler effect , cherenkov radiation are inverted .",
    "the subject of composite systems made up of metamaterials has gained un unexpected momentum and the research interest seems to have focused not only on the photonic crystals with metamaterial components [ 5 - 12 ] but also on the single- and multi - layered planar structures [ 13 - 22 ] as well as on the ( usually ) single cylindrical geometries [ 23 - 34 ] .",
    "the interesting phenomena emerging from the geometries involving metamaterials include the slowing , trapping , and releasing of the light signals [ 35 ] , the proposal of the cloaking devices [ 36 ] , and the extraordinary refraction of light [ 37 ] .",
    "the early development of the subject can be found in interesting review articles by pendry [ 38 ] and by boardman [ 39 ] .",
    "cloaking is an illusion like a mirage : you steer light around an object and therefore you never see the object . the tailored response of the metamaterials has had a dramatic impact on engineering , optics , and physics communities alike , because they can offer electromagnetic properties that are difficult or impossible to achieve with naturally occurring materials .",
    "the recent research interest in surface plasmonic wave optics has been invigorated by the experiment performed on the transmission of light through subwavelength holes in metal films [ 40 ] .",
    "this experiment has spurred numerous theoretical [ 41 - 44 ] as well experimental [ 45 - 49 ] works on similar structured surfaces : either perforated with holes , slits , dimples , or decorated with grooves .",
    "it has been argued that resonant excitation of surface plasmonic waves creates huge electric fields at the surface that force the light through the holes , yielding very high transmission coefficients .",
    "the idea of tailoring the topography of a perfect conductor to support the surface waves resembling the behavior of the surface plasmonic waves at optical frequencies was discussed in the context of a surface with an array of two - dimensional holes [ 44 ] .",
    "the experimental verification of this proposal has recently been reported [ 50 - 52 ] on the structured metamaterial surfaces which support surface plasmonic waves at microwave frequencies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the plasmonic wave propagation in the coaxial cables fabricated of metamaterials interlaced with conventional dielectrics using the green - function ( or response function ) theory in the absence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "the roots of our theoretical approach lie virtually in the interface - response theory ( irt ) [ 53 ] generalized to be applicable to such quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) systems .",
    "ever since its inception , the irt has been extensively applied to study various quasi - particle excitations ( such as phonons , plasmons , magnons , etc . ) in heterostructures and superlattices [ 54 - 56 ] .",
    "the use of irt has numerous advantages over the traditional maxwell equations with boundary conditions .",
    "it is very well known that the maxwell equations with proper boundary conditions only provide us with the dispersion relations for the given electromagnetic waves in an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "the irt , which is essentially a matrix formulation , on the other hand , enables us to obtain not only the dispersion relations of the desired excitations but also provides us with a wide platform to study various static and dynamic properties in terms of the response functions of the resultant systems at hand .",
    "these include , for instance , the local and total density of states , reflection and transmission coefficients , inelastic light and electron scattering , tunneling phenomena , and selective transmission , to name a few .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss some relevant basic notions of the cylindrical geometry and calculate the bulk response function . in sec .",
    "iii we present theoretical formalism to derive the final expressions for the plasmonic wave dispersion relations in the compact form , discuss some analytical diagnoses of the general expressions under special limits , and give some explicit relationship between the response functions and the density of states . in sec .",
    "iv we report several interesting illustrative examples on the plasmonic wave dispersion and density of states in a variety of experimentally feasible situations . finally , we conclude our findings and list some interesting dimensions worth adding to the problem in the future in sec . v.",
    "we consider the electromagnetic waves propagating with an angular frequency @xmath9 and wave vector @xmath10 in a medium defined by the cylindrical coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "the plasmonic waves , here as well as in the later part of this work , will be assumed to observe the spatial localization along the direction perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder .",
    "note that the situation is totally unlike that in the cartesian co - ordinate system where one can safely and readily define the sagittal plane ( i.e. , the plane defined by the wave vector and the normal to the surface / interface ) and hence isolate the transverse magnetic ( tm ) and the transverse electric ( te ) modes , at least in the absence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "the only exception to this notion is the voigt geometry ( with a magnetic field parallel to the surface / interface and perpendicular to the propagation vector ) that can still ( i.e. , even in the presence of an applied magnetic field ) allow the separation of the tm and te modes ( see , for details , ref . 1 ) . in the literature on optics the tm and te modes",
    "are also known by the name of p - polarization and s - polarization , respectively .",
    "it should be pointed out that since we are interested in the artificially designed metamaterials whose response is measured both in terms of the effective @xmath12 and @xmath4 , @xmath13 in the maxwell curl - field equations . after eliminating the magnetic field variable @xmath14 from these curl - field equations , we obtain    @xmath15    here both @xmath12 and @xmath4 are scalar quantities , since the system we are concerned with is not subjected to any external magnetic field and the physical system is assumed to be isotropic . in eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) @xmath16 is the vacuum wave vector , where @xmath17 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "we will take the spatial and temporal dependence of the electromagnetic fields to be of the form of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 or @xmath14 . recalling the standard definitions of @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 as any scalar ) , and @xmath23 in the cylindrical coordinates , one should be able to split eq .",

    "we choose to work in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 components .",
    "then we first need to evaluate @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 from the maxwell curl - field equations .",

    "the idea of introducing the bbs in the irt [ 53 ] was conceived with two prominent advantages over the contemporary semiclassical approaches in mind .",
    "firstly , it allows one to disconnect completely from the extra mathematical world and hence to confine stringently within the truly building block of the system concerned .",
    "secondly , it implicitly provides a great opportunity to get rid of using the boundary conditions one is so routinely accustomed to in dealing with the inhomogeneous systems . what results is a number of simplified and compact forms of the response functions which one only needs to sum up in order to proceed further for studying the desired physical property of the resultant system at hand .",
    "conceptually , this is achieved by imposing that @xmath17 ( the speed of light ) , @xmath12 ( the electric permittivity ) , and @xmath4 ( the magnetic permeability ) vanish inside the specific region .",
    "this region represents a medium that could , in principle , be semi - infinite or finite . in order to create a medium bounded by a black - box surface , we assume that the eqs . @xmath43 are only valid for either @xmath44 or @xmath45 , with @xmath46 as the radius of the only cylinder in question by now .",
    "then we multiply the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "@xmath43 by the step function @xmath47 or @xmath48 , as the case may be .",
    "we first calculate the two derivatives needed to evaluate eqs .",

    "the plots are rendered in terms of the dimensionless frequency @xmath270 and the propagation vector @xmath271 .",

    "again , since there are two interfaces in the system we obtain two pairs of modes : one for the tm and the other for the te modes .",
    "their asymptotic limits are governed by eqs .",
    "( 3.53 ) and ( 3.54 ) .",
    "the presence of the resonance frequency @xmath237 gives rise to the resonance splitting of all the lower group of the pair of tm modes for different values of @xmath64 .",
    "although the lower group of the pair of te modes cross in between the split tm modes ( inside the shaded region ) , the resonance splitting is clearly pronounced between the corresponding tm modes .",
    "this is shown by the big hollow circle encompassing all the respective split tm modes in the region .",
    "again , the scheme of assigning the modes a tm or a te character is the same as discussed before .",
    "notice that the abruptness observed by the modes while crossing the light line is relatively smoother than that seen in the other cases ( cf . figs . 2 , 5 , and 8) .",
    "it is interesting to remark that all the illustrative examples on the plasmonic wave spectrum presented here reaffirm that the dispersive metamaterial components in the composite enable the structure to support the simultaneous existence of the tm and the te modes .",
    "this effect is solely attributed to the negative - index metamaterials and is otherwise impossible .",

    ", the five resonance peaks ( indicated by arrows ) observed in the local density of states stand exactly at these frequencies .",
    "this implies considerably a very good correspondence between the ( dispersion ) spectrum and the ldos at interface @xmath72 .",
    "the small ( unmarked ) noisy peaks occurring in the vicinity of the resonance frequency @xmath237 are not considered to be a bonafide peaks in the ldos . in the upper panel ,",
    "we plot the ldos for the interface 2 for the same parameters as considered for interface 1 in the lower panel .",
    "we observe five well - defined resonance peaks lying exactly at the aforementioned frequencies .",
    "that means that both interfaces share all the five resonances in the ldos , of course with a difference of magnitude . as to the second small resonance peak in this panel",
    ", we think that interface 2 only slightly feels this resonance .",
    "other resonance peaks in this panel are almost comparable to those in the lower panel . the rest of the remarks made with respect to fig .",
    "9 are also valid here .     and @xmath297 for the system discussed in fig .",
    "we call attention to the dos resonance peaks , indicated by the arrows , corresponding to the five modes in total at @xmath297 in fig . 11 .",

    "the dos are shown in arbitrary units throughout.,width=340,height=377 ]    figure 13 depicts the total density of states for the same two - interface system as investigated in figs .",
    "11 and 12 for @xmath137 and @xmath297 .",
    "such values of @xmath64 and @xmath271 characterize five propagating modes in total in fig .",
    "11 , covering both tm and te modes , and lying at @xmath298 , @xmath299 , @xmath300 , @xmath301 , and @xmath302 .",
    "we observe that there are five well - defined resonance peaks in the total density of states standing exactly at the aforementioned frequencies .",
    "this leads us to infer that there is a very good correspondence between the ( dispersion ) spectrum and the tdos .",
    "it has been observed that scanning other values of the propagation vector @xmath271 for computing the total density of states yields same degree of correspondence with the spectrum . what is more interesting in this case is the fact that the computation of tdos ( as well as ldos ) provides a much better correspondence with the modes in the spectrum even in the radiative region ( toward the left of the light line ) than in the previous cases .",
    "this is attributed to a relatively smoother propagation of the modes in the radiative region in the present case of a dielectric shell bounded by ( identical ) metamaterials .",
    "just as before , we do not give much importance to the pile up of the states near the resonance frequency @xmath237 and the negative peak at @xmath279 .",
    "while we consider their occurrence as natural , they do not bear any physical significance to the problem .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the plasmonic wave dispersion and the density of states in the coaxial cables in the absence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "we derived the general dispersion relations using a green - function ( or response function ) theory in the framework of irt , which has now found widespread use to study numerous excitations in various composite systems . in doing so",
    ", we not only clarify some basic notions in the use of the cylindrical geometries but also diagnose our general analytical results under special limits to reproduce some well - known results on the 2d and 1d plasmon dispersion in quantum wells and quantum wires .",
    "we have also successfully attempted to substantiate our results on plasmonic wave dispersion through the computation of the local and total density of states . while we considered the effect of retardation , the absorption was neglected throughout , except for a small imaginary part needed to be added to the frequency for the purpose of giving a width to the peaks in the dos .",
    "we believe that the present methodology for coaxial cables will also prove to be a powerful theoretical framework for studying , for example , the intrasubband plasmons in the multi - walled carbon nanotubes .",
    "an experimental observation of the radiative as well as non - radiative plasmonic waves in such coaxial cables would be of great interest .",
    "such experiments could possibly involve the well known attenuated total reflection , scattering of high energy electrons , or even raman spectroscopy .",
    "the electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) is already becoming known as a powerful technique for studying the electronic structure , dielectric properties , and plasmon excitations in carbon nanotubes and carbon onions , for example .",
    "our preference for plotting the illustrative numerical results in terms of the dimensionless frequency and propagation vector leaves free an option of choosing the plasma frequency lower or higher , just as the radii of the cables .",
    "future dimensions worth adding to the problem remain open in this context .",
    "the issues , which need to be considered and which could give better insight into the problem , include the role of absorption , the effects of the spatial dispersion , the coupling to the optical phonons , effect of an applied electric field , and most importantly the effect of an applied magnetic field in order to study , for example , the edge magnetoplasmons in the concentric cylindrical cables , to name a few . choosing the unidentical dielectrics and or unidentical metamaterials will only alter the asymptotic limits in the short wavelength limit .",
    "currently , we have been generalizing this theory to be applicable to the multicoaxial cables ( where there should be no limit on the number of interfaces ) and investigating the effects of an applied magnetic field in the faraday geometry on the plasmonic wave dispersion in such concentric cable structures and the results will be reported shortly .",
