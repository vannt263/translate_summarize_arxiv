    "* rationale for using the self - organized polymer ( sop ) model for allosteric transitions : * several studies have shown that the gross features of protein folding @xcite , mechanical unfolding of proteins and rna @xcite and the complicated global motions of large systems can be captured using native structure - based models @xcite . more recently , such native structure - based methods @xcite have also been used to probe transitions between two given end - point structures and to ascertain the nature of robust modes that mediate the allosteric transitions @xcite . in order to realistically simulate transitions between distinct allosteric states ,",
    "it is necessary to use simple coarse - grained models that can be used to capture , at least qualitatively , the inherent dynamics connecting two or more states .",
    "although simple elastic network models have given insights into the nature of low frequency dynamics of a number of systems @xcite , the inherent linearity of the model limits their scope when dealing with potential non - linear motions that must be involved in the allosteric transitions @xcite .",
    "we have recently introduced a novel class of versatile structure - based models that incorporates the fundamental polymeric aspects of proteins and rna .",
    "the sop model , which is easily adopted for use in very large systems , has already proven to be successful in obtaining a number of totally unanticipated results for forced - unfolding and force - quench refolding of rna and proteins @xcite .",
    "building on the successful application to single molecule force spectroscopy of biomolecules we used a variant of the sop model to probe the complex allosteric transitions in a prototypical biological nanomachine , namely , the _ e. coli .",
    "_ chaperonin groel .",
    "structures of groel ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) , that are populated in the reaction cycle , have been determined ( see fig .",
    "s1 for a side view ) .",
    "given the two allosteric states ( say @xmath0 and @xmath1 of groel ) we induce transitions between the two states by switching the energy function representing one structure to another .",
    "a few methods for achieving the switch smoothly have been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "we have advocated a langevin dynamics based method in which the switch is accomplished using eq . 2 of the main text ( see fig",
    ". s2 for a pictorial view ) . in writing the equations of motions given by eq . 2 in the main text , we assume that initially the ensemble of conformations are in the @xmath0 state so that the conformations obey the boltzmann distribution i.e , @xmath164 where @xmath90 is the sop energy for the @xmath0-state groel ( see eq . 2 in the main text ) . upon switching the hamiltonian",
    "( see below ) over a time interval @xmath165 the dynamics follows the equations of motion given in step ( iii ) of eq . 2 in the main text .",
    "as long as fluctuation dissipation theorem is satisfied , so that the standard potential conditions are met @xcite , it can be rigorously shown that at long times the biomolecule will reach the @xmath1 state with the conformations given by the equilibrium boltzmann distribution governed by the hamiltonian @xmath89 .",
    "from this perspective the procedure we have used is rigorous .",
    "the assumption that switch occurs over a predetermined duration requires a few comments .",
    "the allosteric transitions occur as a result of ligand - binding or interactions with other biomolecules . as a result of binding",
    ", local strain is induced at the interaction site or sites .",
    "as long as the rate of strain propagation is larger than the rate of conformational change of the molecule then the switch over a reasonable time is justified .",
    "extremely rapid switching , which is tantamount to very large local loading rates , is unphysical as is adiabatic change in the energy function . given these extreme situations",
    "we choose a value of @xmath104 that falls in between the extreme conditions . in our procedure @xmath104",
    "can be adjusted to mimic the potential rate of strain propagation , which induces the allosteric transitions .",
    "the efficacy of the procedure has been demonstrated by successful applications to describe the multiple allosteric transitions in groel .",
    "+ * implementation of the hamiltonian switch : * here we give details of the algorithm for executing the second step in the equations of motion ( see subsection _ additional details _ in the methods section in the main text ) . during the transition interval",
    "we define @xmath166 using linear combination of @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath167 is the distance between the residues @xmath64 and @xmath68 in the structure @xmath67 with @xmath168 or @xmath1 .",
    "the switch between @xmath105 and @xmath106 is carried out slowly every 100 time steps . in the initial stage of the @xmath18 transition ( 0 to 100 time steps ) we let @xmath169 .",
    "subsequently , we set @xmath170 where @xmath171 is changed every 100 time steps .",
    "thus , the switch in @xmath172 occurs over 10,000 time steps",
    ". the loading condition can be varied by changing the number of time steps used to achieve the switch in the distances between the native contacts .",
    "for convenience we used a linear combination of @xmath173 and @xmath174 during the switch process .",
    "more generally , one can use non linear combinations , i.e. , @xmath175 where @xmath176 is an arbitrary function ( exponential for example ) .    at the end of each interval",
    ", the new value of @xmath166 is substituted into the sop hamiltonian to compute the forces needed to solve the equations of motion in step ( ii ) ( see eq .",
    "2 of the main text ) . in the present application , the procedure for using",
    "@xmath172 lasts only @xmath177 @xmath122 . as a result",
    ", the dynamics of distant pair is not affected .",
    "only the equilibrium distances of native pairs , that are already in contact in the @xmath0 state but lead to instability in the intergration of equations of motion due to rapid switching from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , are corrected to the equilibrium distances at @xmath1 state ( see fig .",
    "s2 ) . + * time scales and their relevance : * the characteristic time scale of the brownian dynamics in the overdamped limit is @xmath178 where we used the friction coefficient @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 @xmath182 for proteins . the simulations are performed at @xmath183 @xmath117 ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "we chose the integration time step @xmath185 for ( i ) and ( iii ) while @xmath120 for ( ii ) .",
    "thus , @xmath186 integration time steps with @xmath185 in our brownian dynamics simulations correspond to @xmath187 @xmath27 . because we have used a minimal model for groel the time scales quoted in the main text",
    "should be viewed as lower limit for the various processes .",
    "the actual time scales are expected to be much longer .",
    "the relatively time scales for different aspects of the allosteric transitions are likely to be correct .",
    "for example , we find that the tilt of k and l helices occur four times more slowly than the f and m helices ( see fig . 3 in the main text ) .",
    "our prediction of factor of four is , in all likelihood , an accurate estimate . during simulations we collected the structures",
