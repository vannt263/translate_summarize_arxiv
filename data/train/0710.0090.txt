    "the finding we emphasize here is not the previously known concentration of high mass stars in the cluster core but the richness , extent , and symmetrical appearance of the w3  main stellar cluster on scales of several parsecs .",
    "the vast majority of these sources are low - mass pms stars with only minor contamination by galactic field stars or extragalactic sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while the stellar concentration in the central portion can be seen in @xmath12-band images @xcite , the full extent and simple structure of w3  main can not be discerned in the nir due to the combination of patchy obscuration , nebular emission , and galactic field star contamination .",

    "the absence of a cluster in w3  north was suggested by @xcite based on nir imagery , and we strongly confirm this result with our x - ray observations .",
    "we find that three famous massive star - forming sites in the w3 cloud show remarkable variety in their low mass stellar distributions : a rich spherical cluster , an elongated collection of sparse star clumps , and a completely isolated o star .",
    "evidence for these differences was provided by earlier infrared studies , but the _ chandra _ dataset gives a more definitive view of this morphological diversity from its more complete and unbiased sample of the low mass population",
    ". we can discuss the origin of the structures in w3 .",
    "the w3(oh ) cluster is an order of magnitude smaller and roughly 20 times less rich than the w3  main cluster .",
    "the patchy distribution of stars , elongated along an axis perpendicular to a vector pointing towards the older ic  1795 cluster , supports a triggered origin due to ic  1795 ionization and wind shock fronts as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the two small clusters , seen both in nir @xcite and x - ray images , lie along this same line and could have been triggered by the same shocks .",
    "the morphology of the pms stellar distribution around w3(oh ) resembles those seen in small cometary globules @xcite and in larger molecular clouds @xcite at the edges of hii regions .",
    "the elongation in stars around w3(oh ) appears perpendicular to the axis pointing towards ic  1795 , similar to the elongation of the m17  sw stellar distribution which lies along the photodissociation region and perpendicular to the axis pointing towards the m17 central cluster ngc  6618 @xcite .",
    "the w3(oh ) structure has the fragmented and elongated appearance expected from the `` collect and collapse '' scenario of triggered star formation at the edge of an hii region @xcite .    for w3  north",
    ", we have a clear demonstration that its ionizing o star is isolated , unaccompanied by a cluster of lower mass stars .",
    "the simplest explanation is a runaway o star ejected from a rich cluster in the w3/w4 region .",
    "the w3  north radio continuum structure does have a cometary tail on the sse side of the ionizing star , suggesting a northwesterly motion through the molecular medium @xcite .",
    "this is inconsistent with an origin in w3  main which would require a northeasterly motion , but may indicate an origin in the older ic  1795 or ic  1805 clusters .",
    "accurate proper motions are needed to test this model200  mas  yr@xmath43 ) for this star based on photographic sky survey plates , but examination of the digitized sky survey using nasa s _ skyview _ service shows a bright source in the same location in both dss1 and dss2 , implying that the nomad proper motions are erroneous .",
    "the region has bright irregular nebular emission , so mistakes can easily be made . ] .",
    "an alternative explanation , which seems feasible although improbable , is an origin within the local w3  north molecular cloud .",
    "statistical simulations of sparse clusters with random draws from a standard initial mass function show a wide dispersion of maximum stellar masses @xcite and a few cases of field o stars support occasional formation of massive stars in isolation @xcite . in particular , the late - o star ionizing kr  140 , lying a degree south of w3  main in the w3 molecular cloud , may have formed in isolation @xcite .",
    "our findings do not support a simple unified origin of w3  north , w3  main , and w3(oh ) as proposed by @xcite . in their interpretation , the three regions of high - mass star formation are components of a shell of molecular cloud material triggered into gravitational collapse by the ionization and wind shocks produced by the older ic  1795 star cluster lying east of the w3 molecular cloud . in contrast , we find that only the w3(oh ) stellar population has the morphology expected from direct triggering by ic  1795 shock fronts .",
    "the other two w3 stellar populations have very different morphologies : the single o star ionizing w3  north either formed in isolation or was dynamically ejected from one of the richer nearby clusters , and the w3  main cluster has a spherical , centrally condensed appearance that does not reflect the recent passage of a shock .",
    "two inferences can be made from the morphology shown in figure  [ fig : w3main_smooth ] .",
    "these provide strong constraints on the formation process of the rich w3  main cluster .",
    "first , as outlined above and shown in figure  [ fig : w3main_smooth ] , the large - scale sphericity of the cluster implies that the role of triggering by shocks from the older ic  1795 cluster ( or by the w4 superbubble further to the east ) discussed by @xcite is negligible , or at most indirect , in the sense that the star formation did not follow the passage of a localized shock .",
    "there is no elongation of the stellar distribution along an east - west axis associated with a shock .",
    "w3  main was either formed independently of an external trigger , or has dynamically evolved so that evidence of its triggered origin has been erased .",
    "the centrally concentrated , spherical morphology resembles the distribution of x - ray stars in the orion nebula cluster ionizing the orion nebula @xcite , the ngc  6618 cluster ionizing the m  17 hii region @xcite , the ngc  2244 cluster ionizing the rosette nebula @xcite , and many other yscs .",
    "these stand in contrast to the unconcentrated and elongated stellar distributions attributable to shock triggering in small cometary globules @xcite and in larger molecular clouds @xcite at the edges of hii regions .",
    "the second inference concerning the origin of w3  main to be made from the _ chandra _ image is that at least some of the ob stars  those ionizing the well - studied hypercompact and ultracompact hii regions at the core of w3  main  formed after the bulk of the more widely distributed cluster pms stars .",
    "these hii regions have dynamical ages of @xmath44  yr @xcite  km  s@xmath43 motion ) at the center of a dense molecular core , or that it has entered a second core at a later time .",
    "it seems doubtful that this would fortuitously occur for several o stars in the central region of w3 , and in any case can not explain the hypercompact regions in w3  m. ] . if the pms stars had similar ages , they would all be class  0i protostars .",
    "however , only a few percent of acis sources are class  ii , and @xmath45% appear to be class  o  i in the @xcite dataset of the brighter _ spitzer _ sources .",
    "it is not possible that there exists a vast population of class  o  i sources undetected by _ spitzer _ in the outer regions of w3  main . in the central region around",
    "irs  5 , whre _ spitzer _ sensitivity is limited by the bright diffuse emission , @xcite found that no more than 30% of the nir sources were class  i. this implies that most of the pms stars in w3  main are class  iii , as in most other young stellar clusters observed with _",
    "chandra _ , and the age of the low - mass population is @xmath46  myr . even in clusters rich in class 0 protostars , such as ngc  1333 ,",
    "many x - ray sources are class ii and iii systems @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy in w3  main may constitute the best case that a pms population is much older ( @xmath47  myr ) than at least part of its associated ob population ( @xmath48  myr ) .",
    "if the pms stars are characteristically @xmath22 years old and some of the central ob stars are @xmath49 years old , those ob stars must have formed after the lower mass stars .",
    "this form of age spread has long been noted in older stellar clusters from studies of hr diagrams @xcite . a young age has also been indirectly suggested for the trapezium ob stars in orion based on the inferred short lifetimes of proplyds in the presence of ultraviolet photoevaporation @xcite .",
    "the w3  main ob stars are directly confirmed to be extremely young and still forming based on their very small hii regions ; this is crucial for establishing that the central ob stars formed after the larger pms population .",
    "together , these two results strongly preclude the application of an old and simple model of cluster and high mass star formation ( see reviews by bonnell et al .",
    "2007 and larson 2007 ) .",
    "pre - stellar molecular cloud condensations were traditionally thought to be centrally concentrated with higher densities @xmath50 at the center ; e.g. , an isothermal equilibrium bonnor - ebert sphere .",
    "the free - fall time is then shorter at the core , @xmath51 , implying rapid gravitational collapse and fragmentation .",
    "gas quickly falls into the central region where , if bondi - hoyle accretion is unimpeded , the more massive protostars tend to grow fastest according to @xmath52",
    ". disk accretion of high mass protostars can be very rapid with @xmath53  m@xmath7  yr@xmath43 implying full growth in @xmath54  yr ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "in these simple scenarios for cluster formation , ob stars concentrated in the cores might be older , but certainly not younger , than the surrounding lower mass pms stars .",
    "however , several more complicated models for cluster and high - mass star formation are consistent with our w3  main results :    1 .",
    "star formation in large molecular clouds may occur inefficiently over a prolonged period , perhaps because their dynamics are dominated by supersonic turbulence within which only a small fraction of the molecular material resides in dense cores at a given moment @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the stars may form in a quick burst of star formation at the end of the cloud s life , as the star formation rate becomes efficient only when turbulence has subsided and the cloud contracts @xcite .",
    "astrophysical issues relating slow and fast star formation in clusters are discussed by @xcite .",
    "w3  main exhibits a particular mass - dependency in its extended star formation history in that the majority of lower mass stars appear in the widely distributed older population while only a minority accompany the ob stars at the core .",
    "the formation of massive ob stars specifically might be delayed with respect to lower mass stars .",
    "this delay might occur during the gaseous phase , where the formation of a high density core may be inhibited by the combined effect of many protostellar outflows @xcite . or the delay might occur during the stellar dynamical phase , waiting for stars to settle into the core gravitational potential where mergers form massive stars @xcite .",
    "3 .   star formation may occur primarily in spatially distributed molecular cores which , only after forming many lower mass stars over an extended time , settle towards the cluster center where densities are sufficiently high to form high - mass stars .",
    "a version of this model is described by @xcite as an explanation for mass segregation in massive clusters .",
    "w3  main may contain two generations of ob stars , the latter arising from triggering by the growing hii regions of the former @xcite . the basis for this model is the presence of both diffuse hii regions ( w3 a , d , h , j , and k in figure [ fig : w3main_small ] ) and ultracompact and hypercompact hii regions ( w3 b , e , f , g , and m ) .",
    "this would be a case of internal triggering by w3 ob shocks rather than external triggering by ic  1795 shocks .    at present",
    ", we can not differentiate between these models for w3  main . a useful observation",
    "would be high spatial resolution mir imaging to study disk properties of the lower mass _ chandra _ stars in the close vicinity of the ob stars ( figure [ fig : w3main_small ] ) .",
    "this would reveal whether these concentrated pms stars are younger than the more widely distributed pms stars .",
    "this paper introduces a new high - resolution x - ray mosaic of the w3 star forming complex , a large project of the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. a rich population of @xmath2 young stars is imaged and the three well - known regions of high - mass star formation are shown to have very different populations of low mass stars : w3  main is a large , rich , nearly spherical cluster ; w3(oh ) lies in an elongated group of sparse stellar clumps ; and w3  north is an isolated o star without low - mass companions .",
    "suggestions of these differences were inferred from earlier infrared studies , but they are more apparent here because the x - ray selection has the advantage of low contamination by the galactic field population or diffuse interstellar emission , high penetration into molecular environments , and little bias towards stars with massive protoplanetary disks .",
    "we emerge from this study with an improved view of star formation in the region .",
    "the w3(oh ) structures are consistent with collect - and - collapse triggering process caused by by shocks from the older ic  1795 cluster , as previously suggested .",
    "the w3  main cluster , however , does not show the elongated and patchy structure of a recently triggered star cluster and appears to have formed in an earlier episode .",
    "its pms population strongly resembles those seen in other _",
    "chandra _ studies of massive star - forming regions such as those ionizing the orion , m  17 and rosette nebulae .",
    "a major difference is that the individual hii regions in these other clusters have already merged into a large blister and dispersed their natal clouds .",
    "in contrast , the w3  main ob stars are very recently formed with small individual hii regions still embedded in a dense , clumpy molecular medium .",
    "star formation in w3 has proceeded in a prolonged fashion , and apparently with a time - dependent initial mass function .",
    "the ob stars exciting the hypercompact and ultracompact hii regions at the center of w3  main formed more recently than the hundreds of x - ray emitting pms stars distributed over several parsecs .",
