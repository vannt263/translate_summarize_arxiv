    "the problem of a two - state quantum system driven by a time - dependent pulsed external field plays a central role in quantum physics @xcite .",
    "first of all , this problem is interesting by itself both physically and mathematically : physically , because the two - state system is the simplest nontrivial system with discrete energy states in quantum mechanics ; mathematically , because the schrdinger equation for two states poses interesting mathematical challenges some of which are exactly soluble .",
    "furthermore , already in the two - state case , important nonclassical phenomena occur , for instance , the famous rabi oscillations , which often serve as a test for quantum behavior , and also provide a powerful tool for coherent control of quantum dynamics , e.g. by @xmath2 pulses . finally ,",
    "in almost all cases ( except for a few exactly soluble ) , the behavior of a multistate quantum system can only be understood by reduction to one or more effective two - state systems , e.g. , by adiabatic elimination of weakly coupled states or by using some intrinsic symmetries .    besides the well - known solution for exact resonance ,",
    "there exist several exactly soluble two - state models , the most widely used being the rabi rabi , landau - zener @xcite , rosen - zener @xcite , allen - eberly @xcite , bambini - berman @xcite , demkov - kunike @xcite , carroll - hioe @xcite , demkov @xcite and nikitin @xcite models .",
    "all these models provide the transition probability between two _ nondegenerate _ states .",
    "degenerate ( in rwasense ) states @xmath3 are coupled simultaneously to an upper state @xmath4 , possibly off single - photon resonance by a detuning @xmath5 , with rabi frequencies @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "bottom : the same system in the morris - shore basis .",
    "there are @xmath1 uncoupled dark states @xmath8 , and a pair of coupled states , a bright state @xmath9 and the upper state @xmath10 , with the same detuning @xmath5 as in the original basis and a coupling given by the rms rabi frequency @xmath11 , eq .",

    "@xcite we show that the ( @xmath12)-state problem can be reduced to an effective two - state problem involving a bright state and the upper , nondegenerate state . if known , the propagator for this subsystem can be used to find the solution for the full ( @xmath12)-state system .",

    "the phases of the couplings can easily be incorporated in the description and they can be used to control the inner phases of the created superposition states . furthermore , the rabi frequencies are assumed to be pulse - shaped functions with the same time dependence @xmath25 , but possibly with different magnitudes,@xmath26and hence different pulse areas,@xmath27      the linkage pattern described by the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be implemented experimentally in laser excitation of atoms or molecules .",

    "it will be followed by a detailed discussion of the rosen - zener ( rz ) model , which can be seen as an extension of the resonance solution to nonzero detuning for a special pulse shape ( hyperbolic secant ) . both the resonance and the rz model allow for the parameter @xmath74 to obtain the important values @xmath117 .",
    "the rabi model can also be used to illustrate the interesting cases of population distribution associated with these values of @xmath74 but its rectangular pulse shape is less attractive ( and also less realistic ) than the beautiful sech - shape of the pulse in the rz model .",

    "the demkov - kunike ( dk ) model is a very versatile model , which combines and generalizes the rz and ae models . indeed , as seen in table table - a - exact , the dk model reduces to the rz model for @xmath120 and to the ae model for @xmath121 . for the dk model",
