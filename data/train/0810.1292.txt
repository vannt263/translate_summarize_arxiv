    "the _ casimir force _ predicted in the seminal work of casimir @xcite is an attractive force @xmath0 between two perfect conducting neutral plates with area @xmath1 facing each other at a distance @xmath2 .",
    "this attraction originates from the modification of the long - range fluctuations of the quantum electromagnetic field , due to the boundary conditions imposed by the conducting plates @xcite . the casimir energy ",
    "the difference between the energies of the quantum electromagnetic field for the plates at distance @xmath2 and at @xmath3 , respectively  is proportional to @xmath4 @xcite ; so is the casimir force , that is the derivative of this energy with respect to the distance between the plates .",
    "although the original casimir interaction has a quantum nature , such an effect occurs in many classical systems where fluctuations are of thermal origin @xcite .",
    "in fact , fluctuation - induced forces appear in systems with fluctuating long - range correlations that are geometrically confined by inserting external objects in the correlated medium .",
    "examples can be found in nematic liquid crystals @xcite , critical mixtures @xcite , superfluid films @xcite , and granular media @xcite . in a thermally noisy correlated medium , where long range spatial correlations exist due to thermal fluctuations , the casimir energy ( and force ) is expected to be proportional to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the results of a recent experimental study on the critical mixtures reveal that the casimir energy is indeed very sensitive to the temperature of the system @xcite . depending on the characteristics of the system",
    ", the fluctuation - induced force has been found to be even repulsive , e.g.  in dielectric materials with nontrivial magnetic susceptibility @xcite , or the interaction between a perfectly conducting and an infinitely permeable plate @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation - induced force between two intruder objects immersed in a granular gas is studied in @xcite , where it is found that the confinement of the fluctuation spectrum of the hydrodynamic pressure field induced by the intruders , leads to different local pressures in the gap between the intruders and the outside region .",
    "this effect causes an effective casimir - like force between the intruders .",
    "the results of some experiments on granular fluids have confirmed the idea that the presence of large intruder particles modifies the thermodynamic properties such as pressure , velocity and density in the regions between the larger particles @xcite .",
    "appearance of long - range interactions ( despite the short - range nature of the interactions on the grain scale ) may shed new light on the mechanism of some collective behaviors , e.g.  segregation @xcite , in granular media .    in this paper we present the results of extensive numerical simulations to study the fluctuation - induced force between two large objects immersed in a noisy granular gas .",
    "although the interactions between particles in granular systems are dissipative @xcite , we maintain the dynamics by means of an external driving force .",
    "our main aims in the present work are to investigate the probability distribution of the fluctuating casimir - like force and the relationship between the average force and important parameters of the system such as the steady - state temperature , the mass density of gas particles and the distance between the intruders . the question of whether the average force depends on the system size is also addressed .",
    "the system we consider is a two - dimensional granular gas of identical rigid disks of radius @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 interacting via inelastic collisions . in order to exclude the undesired effects of side walls ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in both directions of the square - shaped system of length @xmath8 .",
    "two immobile rigid intruder particles of radius @xmath9 and infinite mass and moment of inertia are immersed in the granular gas bed , separated by a distance @xmath2 .",
    "we have one reference system whose parameters are denoted by zero subscripts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - schematic ] ) . throughout the paper we either use this reference system or vary only one parameter to check its effect while other parameters are kept fixed at their reference values .",
    "we perform molecular dynamics simulations in which the number density @xmath10 of the granular gas is @xmath11 and the effective normal coefficient of restitution @xmath12 of the particle - particle and particle - intruder collisions is set to 0.8 .    , @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the reference system . ]",
    "the system is coupled to an external heat bath that homogeneously transfers energy into the system .",
    "the acceleration of each particle @xmath15 is perturbed instantaneously according to @xmath16 , where prime refers to the acceleration after perturbation , and @xmath17 can be considered as gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlation @xmath18 , where @xmath12 and @xmath19 denote cartesian components of vectors @xcite .",
    "practically , the energy is transferred into the system in the following way @xcite : we update the momentum of each grain at each time step @xmath20 .",
    "the components of the momentum are updated by adding random values that are chosen from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath21 .",
    "the simulation results [ solid line in fig .  [ fig - forcedistribution](a ) ] reveal that the temperature @xmath22 is time dependent and finally saturates . note that the temperature @xmath22 is a uniform field in our simulations in contrast to the case where energy flows into the system from the boundaries which leads to the spatial gradient of temperature @xcite .",
    "we follow a mean - field approach to describe the time evolution of @xmath22 . on the one hand the system gains energy due to coupling with the heat bath .",
    "the rate of the energy gain of a single particle averaged over the uncorrelated noise source @xmath23 is @xmath24 g(\\xi ) d\\xi = dm\\xi_{_0}^2.\\ ] ] on the other hand the system losses energy due to inelastic collisions .",
    "the rate of the energy loss of a single particle is described by @xmath25 @xcite , where @xmath26 is the dimension of the system , @xmath27 is the temperature - dependent collision frequency given by the enskog theory @xcite , and @xmath19 is a coefficient that contains all of the relevant parameters except the temperature .",
    "therefore the time dependence of temperature ( energy ) according to mean - field approximation is given by @xmath28 . by integrating the equation @xmath29 @xcite ,",
    "one arrives at the following expression for the evolution of @xmath22 [ dash - dot line in fig .",
    "[ fig - forcedistribution](a ) ] : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the initial temperature and @xmath32    starting from any initial configuration , the driven granular gas finally converges to a nonequilibrium steady state , where energy dissipation due to inelastic collisions is balanced with the energy input . although the mean - field prediction for the saturated temperature is @xmath33 , the temperature of the nonequilibrium steady state @xmath34 [ dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig - forcedistribution](a ) ] is expected to be larger than @xmath35 since it is logarithmically divergent in the system size ( in 2d ) due to the existence of spatial hydrodynamic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "after the system achieves the stationary state , we study the effective interaction between the two fixed intruders .",
    "we measure the total momenta @xmath36 and @xmath37 transferred from the granular gas to the left and right intruders respectively , during a time interval @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath38 corresponds to @xmath39 time steps ( @xmath40 collisions per grain ) .",
    "the components of @xmath36 and @xmath37 parallel to the line connecting the two centers of intruders provide the fluctuation - induced force as @xmath41 . since this force is itself a fluctuating quantity ,",
    "as expected for such correlated media @xcite , we let the simulation run until we measure the force for more than @xmath39 consecutive time intervals @xmath38 .",

    "the ensemble average of @xmath42 in the reference system equals to @xmath44 .",
    "the fluctuations are about two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath45 , thus very long simulations are required to measure the force with small numerical errors .",
    "such a repulsive force between two intruder objects sitting at a distance larger than their radii was reported in the previous studies of driven granular gases @xcite and even dense shaken granular packings @xcite .",
    "is scaled by the mean - field steady - state temperature @xmath35 .",

    "since the energy considerations yield @xmath49 @xcite , the steady state temperature ( according to the enskog theory ) then becomes @xmath50 to investigate how the casimir - like force is affected by the simulation parameters , we vary the parameter values one by one while the others are kept fixed at their reference values and measure the force . for this purpose , simulations are performed anew for each data point in figs .",

    "we note that the values of @xmath51 around @xmath52 reflect the accuracy level of our calculations .",

    "we obtain @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the stationary pressure and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the first and second derivatives of @xmath67 with respect to @xmath10 around @xmath68 , respectively . by employing the fourier transform of the fluctuating fields @xmath69 and the structure factors @xmath70 @xcite we rewrite @xmath60 @xcite : @xmath71 . \\label{pressurestructurfactor}\\ ] ] in the calculation of the pressure the main contribution comes from the region of small @xmath72 . substituting the structure factors of this region , @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is a function of the number density , restitution coefficient and noise intensity ) , we obtain the steady - state pressure : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a function of the number density @xmath10 and is negative for our simulations . in the gap between the intruders , the number of valid @xmath77 modes ( and therefore @xmath78 ) is smaller than the outside region . consequently , the pressure in the cross - hatched region is higher than the hatched region .",
    "this pressure difference @xmath79 causes an effective repulsive force between the intruders .",
    "interestingly , @xmath80 ( and therefore @xmath79 and the fluctuation - induced force ) is proportional to @xmath35",
    ".     scaled by @xmath81 in terms of the distance between the intruders @xmath2 scaled by @xmath82 .",
    "the dashed ( dash - dot ) line corresponds to the force calculation with ( without ) taking into account the actual boundary conditions .",
    "( b ) @xmath83 as a function of the system size @xmath8 .",

    "@xcite , supposing that @xmath77 vectors are confined in rectangular boxes of size @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the gap between the intruders and in the outside region , respectively . the dash - dot line in fig .",
    "[ fig - forcedistancesystemsize](a ) displays the casimir force for different distances between the intruders , calculated according to the above mentioned estimation .",
    "the force is overestimated because ( i ) the geometrical simplification ( using rectangular instead of circular boundary conditions ) causes an error in the computed pressure , and ( ii ) the fluctuations are indeed correlated in the hatched and cross - hatched regions .",
    "we have improved this estimation by taking into account the circular shape of the intruders . at each point in the hatched or cross - hatched regions , the components of the allowed @xmath88 vectors in the @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( perpendicular to @xmath89 ) directions are @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the length of the line segment that horizontally connects the surfaces of the two intruders . using the continuous form of @xmath78 , the pressure at this point reads @xmath93 where an upper cutoff @xmath94 is used beyond which hydrodynamics is not valid .",
    "this cutoff is also needed to exclude the singular vector @xmath95 from the integral .",
    "calculating the pressure in the hatched and cross - hatched regions at a given @xmath90 [ according to eq .",
    "( [ pressurenew ] ) ] , we obtain @xmath96 . next , by integrating @xmath96 over the whole range of @xmath90 ( @xmath97 ) to obtain the average force , and repeating the process for different distances between the intruders we get the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig - forcedistancesystemsize](a ) , revealing a significant improvement due to taking into account the actual boundary conditions .",
    "we note that the correlation between the fluctuations in the two regions seems to be important since our results still overestimate the force .",
    "one expects that the interaction between intruders would be affected if a new intruder is inserted into the system .",
    "therefore , our results provides an important evidence for the nonlinearity of the casimir - like forces in thermally noisy systems and offers new insight into the problem which should trigger new experiments and theoretical explanations .",
    "finally we study the system - size dependence of the effective force .",
    "it has been found in ref .  @xcite that @xmath98 in a two - dimensional driven granular gas is logarithmically divergent in the system size due to hydrodynamic fluctuations .",
    "such a size dependence is also expected for @xmath54 since we have verified a linear dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath99 .",
    "the simulation results [ fig .",
    "[ fig - forcedistancesystemsize](b ) ] reveal that @xmath54 increases slightly as the system size @xmath8 increases and the data can be well fitted to a logarithmic curve @xmath100 with less than @xmath101 error . within the investigated range of @xmath8 , the deviation of the data from the logarithmic relation does not show a systematic dependence on the system size [ inset of fig .  [",
    "fig - forcedistancesystemsize](b ) ] .",
    "the increase of @xmath54 with @xmath8 can be also explained qualitatively in the following way : when the system size is increased at a fixed @xmath2 , the number of possible @xmath77 modes ( and @xmath78 ) in the hatched region of fig .",
    "[ fig - schematic ] increases ; consequently , the mean pressure in the hatched region is reduced while the pressure in the cross - hatched region is not varied .",
    "this leads to the increase of pressure difference between the hatched and cross - hatched regions which yields the increase of @xmath54 .",
    "in summary , we have carried out numerical simulations of the fluctuation - induced force between two intruders in a driven granular gas bed .",
    "earlier works have demonstrated that such a force is expected since the thermodynamic properties are affected due to the presence of the intruders . here , our main focus has been to study the fluctuating nature of this interaction and the temperature dependence of the ensemble average of the force @xmath54 .",
    "we have verified that @xmath54 increases linearly with temperature , and slightly with system size that can be described by a logarithmic growth .",
    "we have also improved the estimation given in @xcite to explain the force , by taking into account the actual boundary conditions of the problem .",
