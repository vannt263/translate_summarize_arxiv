    "the assumption of quadratic spectrum in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is introduced for simplicity , and most of the results we obtain apply to a generic spectrum . in particular , our theory is applicable to the one - dimensional hubbard model , with an important exception of the half - filled case , where the charge excitation spectrum is gapped .    the effect of interactions on the low - energy properties of the system is quantified by the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the fourier transform of the interaction potential .",
    "parameter @xmath38 controls the amplitude of forward scattering of two electrons at the fermi surface .",
    "positive value of @xmath38 leads to the enhancement of the velocity of charge excitations @xmath8 over the fermi velocity .",

    "strong backscattering impedes propagation of spin excitations through the system and leads to the suppression of the spin velocity @xmath9 . in the case of short - range interactions ,",
    "the two parameters are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "on the other hand , in quantum wires the electrons interact via long - range coulomb repulsion , which is usually screened at a large distance @xmath40 by a metal gate . in this case @xmath41 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume strong backscattering , @xmath42 .      in the limit @xmath43 collisions of two electrons with opposite spins result in complete backscattering .",
    "in this case the processes of spin exchange are completely suppressed , and the energy of the system no longer depends on the spin degrees of freedom . to find the energy of any state ,",
    "one can assume that all the spins @xmath44 , or , equivalently , assume that the fermions in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : original_hamiltonian ] ) are spinless , @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian @xmath46 describes the charge excitations in the system .",
    "each eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : original_holon_hamiltonian ] ) for a system of @xmath47 electrons is a degenerate multiplet of @xmath48 spin states .    in this paper",

    "[ fig : spin - regions ] . due to the strong repulsive interactions",
    ", electrons can not pass through each other . as a result electron @xmath53",
    "is always confined between electrons @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and their spins can not move through the system .    at strong but finite repulsion",
    "the amplitude of forward scattering of electrons does not vanish .",
    "such processes give rise to a weak exchange of the spins at the neighboring sites , e.g. , @xmath53 and @xmath55 . to leading order",
    "the coupling of the next - nearest neighbors can be neglected .",
    "the symmetry with respect to spin rotations dictates the form of coupling between the spins : @xmath56 the exchange constant @xmath0 is positive , as otherwise the ground state of a system of one - dimensional electrons would have been spin - polarized , in violation of the lieb - mattis theorem.@xcite    thus we conclude that the hamiltonian of a one - dimensional system of strongly interacting electrons can be written as a sum @xmath57 . in the case of the hubbard model",
    "this was first noticed by ogata and shiba,@xcite who discovered that in the limit of strong repulsion the bethe ansatz ground state of the system factorizes into a direct product of the ground state of non - interacting fermions ( holons ) and the ground state of the heisenberg spin chain ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) . in the context of quantum wires the description based on the hamiltonian @xmath58",
    "was used in refs .  .",
    "the long - range nature of the coulomb repulsion between electrons in a quantum wire results in the exponential suppression of the exchange constant,@xcite @xmath59 here the prefactor @xmath60 , the bohr radius is defined as @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the dielectric constant .",
    "it is worth mentioning that one can replace the hamiltonian ( [ eq : original_hamiltonian ] ) with the sum of two independent hamiltonians ( [ eq : original_holon_hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) only at sufficiently low energies .",
    "indeed , the backscattering amplitude for two electrons with wavevectors @xmath63 is @xmath64 , and tends to zero at @xmath65 for any reasonable interaction potential .",
    "( here @xmath66 is the velocity of an electron with wavevector @xmath3 . )",
    "thus at high energies the initial assumption of strong backscattering is violated . to find the region of applicability of our low - energy theory",
    ", one can estimate the correction to the exchange constant ( [ eq : j ] ) caused by the fact that at higher energies the distances between electrons fluctuate , and the density @xmath11 is no longer constant .",
    "given that the rigidity of the wigner crystal is due to the coulomb repulsion between the electrons , we estimate @xmath67 , and the exchange @xmath0 acquires significant corrections in the presence of excitations with energies @xmath68",
    ". thus our subsequent results are valid up to energies of order @xmath1 , rather than the somewhat higher energy scale @xmath69 . in the case of short - range interactions the scales @xmath21 and @xmath1 are of the same order of magnitude .      the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : original_holon_hamiltonian ] ) , ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) is defined in terms of the holon field operators @xmath49 and the spin operators @xmath70 , rather than the original electron operators @xmath71 . in order to apply the effective theory ( [ eq : original_holon_hamiltonian ] ) , ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) to problems formulated in terms of electrons ( e.g. , calculation of the spectral functions ) we need to establish the relations between the electron operators and the new variables .    in the context of the hubbard model",
    "this issue was addressed by penc _",
    "et al._,@xcite who used the definition @xmath72 given the relation ( [ eq : holon_density ] ) between the densities of electrons and holons , creation of an electron at point 0 must be accompanied by creation of a holon .",
    "in addition , when a new particle is added to the system of @xmath47 electrons , the spin chain ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) acquires an additional site .",
    "this is accounted for by the operator @xmath73 . by definition ,",
    "operator @xmath74 adds a new site with spin @xmath32 to the spin chain between the sites @xmath54 and @xmath53 .    despite the fact that the rule ( [ eq : penc_operator ] ) leads to a number of correct results",
    "when applied carefully,@xcite it is not a completely satisfactory expression of an electron creation operator in terms of the charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : penc_operator ] ) to @xmath75 is not straightforward.@xcite the origin of the difficulty lies in the fact that unlike the electrons and holons , the spins in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) are not assigned to specific points in space .",
    "when an electron is created at point @xmath76 , the additional site in the spin chain ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) appears at @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the number of electrons ( or holons ) between @xmath79 and point @xmath76 .",
    "we shall therefore define the electron creation and annihilation operators as    [ eq : our_operators ] @xmath80    the most important difference between the expressions ( [ eq : penc_operator ] ) and ( [ eq : our_creation_operator ] ) is that the latter explicitly accounts for the fact that the spins are attached to electrons .",
    "thus despite the apparent separation of the charge and spin degrees of freedom in the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : original_holon_hamiltonian ] ) , ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) , the electron creation operator ( [ eq : our_creation_operator ] ) does not factorize into a product of two operators acting on only charge or only spin variables.@xcite in appendix  [ sec : anticommutation ] we show that our operators ( [ eq : our_operators ] ) satisfy the appropriate anticommutation relations .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the properties of strongly - interacting one - dimensional systems at energies well below the fermi energy , @xmath24 . in this case",
    "the dynamics of the charge degrees of freedom described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : original_holon_hamiltonian ] ) simplifies dramatically .",

    "thus the fermi wavevectors of holons and electrons are related by @xmath89 finally , the parameter @xmath90 in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : bosonized_holon_hamiltonian ] ) is the so - called luttinger - liquid constant .",
    "transformation of the hamiltonian @xmath91 from the fermionic form ( [ eq : original_holon_hamiltonian ] ) to the bosonic form ( [ eq : bosonized_holon_hamiltonian ] ) is accomplished via bosonization procedure,@xcite in which the fermion operators @xmath92 are expressed in terms of the bosonic fields @xmath82 and @xmath83 . at the first step one notices that at low energies the properties of one - dimensional fermi systems are dominated by excitations near the two fermi points .",
    "particles near each of the fermi points propagate in one of two possible directions , right or left .",
    "thus the fermion operator is presented as a sum of two chiral fermions , @xmath93 where the operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 destroy fermions with wavevectors near the right and left fermi points , respectively .",
