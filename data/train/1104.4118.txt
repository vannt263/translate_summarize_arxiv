    "co ( j=1 - 0 ) has historically been one of the most commonly used tracers of physical conditions in the molecular ism .",

    "may arise from the fact that molecular clouds appear have remarkably similar physical properties in both the milky way and nearby galaxies .",
    "gmcs in the galaxy and local universe appear to have a nearly constant surface density of 85 - 100 /pc@xmath20 , obey the size - linewidth relation , and have relatively low kinetic temperatures of 10 - 20 k @xcite .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic and radiative transfer modeling by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have shown that simulated gmcs with mean densities , sizes , velocity dispersions , and metallicities comparable to those found in the galaxy naturally produce  conversion factors comparable to equation  [ eq : xco_definition ] .",

    "the exact origin of a lower  factor in starburst galaxies is not entirely clear .",
    "models by @xcite which predate the aforementioned observations , predicted that warmer molecular gas temperatures in infrared - luminous galaxies may drive a lower  conversion factor due to an increase in co brightness temperature with kinetic temperature in optically thick clouds .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggest that the co line width in starbursts traces a combination of the gaseous and stellar potential , rather than just the  mass . in the case where co is optically thick",

    "while the scaling of  with environmental parameters is not yet known , the ramifications are profound . for example , if  does indeed systematically vary in higher surface density environments , our current understanding of the normalisation and index of the kennicutt - schmidt star formation rate - gas surface density relation in star forming galaxies may change @xcite . at higher redshifts , as high gas surface density galaxies begin to contribute substantially to the cosmic star formation rate density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "indeed , understanding the origin of  in galaxies is difficult in that many of the physical parameters driving the relation are coupled .",

    "as we aim to compare potential variations in  in our simulated galaxy mergers to those that are actually observed , it is worth briefly comparing the physical and synthetic observational properties of our model galaxies to real galaxies .",
    "our fiducial merger has been well - studied in the literature , and is very much an average merger simulation as far as the range of simulated sfrs , black hole accretion rates and bolometric luminosities .",
    "while the processes described in this section generically describe gas - rich mergers , what we summarise here has been calculated and published previously explicitly for our fiducial model .",
    "the merger goes through elevated star formation rate upon first passage as tidal torques on the gas cause the gas to lose angular momentum and fall toward the centres causing high - density regions @xcite .",
    "the galaxy undergoes a starburst upon final coalescence , and peaks in its bolometric luminosity .",

    "the kinematic @xcite , x - ray @xcite , nuclear emission @xcite , and molecular disc properties @xcite of this merger remnant have all been studied and found to be comparable to those observed .",
    "similarly , the remnant lies on the fundamental plane @xcite .",
    "in the far left panel of figure  [ figure : iso_d3_map ] , we show the velocity - integrated brightness temperature map of the model disc galaxy . as expected , the central regions are the brightest , and the outer disc has little co emission . in the top left panel of figure",
    "[ figure : xco_distribution ] , we plot the emission - weighted distribution of  values for the gmcs in our model disc galaxy and the fiducial model merger .",
    "we additionally plot the distribution of gmc physical properties in both the disc and merger .",
    "we will return to this plot frequently throughout this section and the next .",
    "the luminosity - weighted  in our model disc is @xmath155  with a relatively narrow dispersion .",
    "the dispersion is narrow because the surface densities , kinetic temperatures and velocity dispersions of the model disc gmcs show fairly little variation . to remind the reader , the column densities in the gmcs in our disc galaxy",
    "are set to be the surface density of cold gas in the cell .",
    "when the gmc is unresolved in the simulation , we set the subgrid value of the surface density to @xmath156 .",
    "this value was chosen to match the roughly constant surface density of galactic molecular clouds .",
    "nearly all of the gmcs in the model disc take on this value for a surface density .",
    "the kinetic temperatures of gmcs in the disc have a relatively tight distribution near 10 k , as shown in figure  [ figure : xco_distribution ] .",
    "because the gmcs have a relatively low density compared with starbursts ( the mass - weighted value is @xmath157 ) , there is little coupling with the dust grains ( which are a factor of a few hotter ; figure  [ figure : xco_distribution ] ) .",
    "thus the temperature is primarily determined by molecular line cooling , and heating by cosmic rays and the grain photoelectric effect .",
    "the kinetic temperature helps to set the brightness temperature , though the two are not identical . the emission - weighted brightness temperature for the merger(disc )",
    "are @xmath158(7)k .    finally , the distribution of velocity dispersions in the gmcs is fairly narrow . recalling   [ section : methods ] , the velocity dispersion of the clouds is taken by calculating the dispersion amongst the cell s nearest neighbours , with a subgrid model for unresolved clouds ( equation  [ equation : sigma ] ) . because the disc is dynamically cold , the velocity dispersions are primarily set by the latter case .",
    "this results in an emission - weighted velocity dispersion within gmcs in the model disc of @xmath159 , with a maximum of @xmath160 .",
    "these values compare favourably with the velocity dispersions reported in the comprehensive survey of @xcite , and the more recent review by @xcite .",
    "we can ask why the simulated  from the model galaxy is comparable to the galactic average , @xmath161 in principle this occurs because the physical conditions in the model gmcs by and large match those of observed gmcs in the milky way . in this sense , the fact that our model value for  in quiescent discs matches that of the galaxy is by construction . however , there are two salient points here .",
    "first , it is important to remember that we allow for the possibility that the galactic environment can set the physical conditions in the gmcs if the pressure is sufficiently high . the fact that the default value for the surface density and velocity dispersions in the clouds is typically used is a statement that the galactic environment in the model disc galaxy is not sufficiently extreme to cause significant changes in the surface densities , temperatures , or velocity dispersions in the gmcs from the galactic values .",
    "as we will see in the subsequent section , this is not the case in mergers .",
    "second , the subresolution values for the gmcs are not without physics .",
    "gmcs through the local group are observed to obey the @xcite relations : they follow a linewidth - size relationship with @xmath162 , they have virial parameters @xmath163 , and they all have roughly the same surface density @xmath164 @xmath165 pc@xmath166 @xcite",
    ". the origin of these observed relationships is debated , but their universality argues for some sort of internal regulation mechanism operating in gmcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regardless of the underlying mechanism , though , our subgrid model is not simply tuned to reproduce the  right \" @xmath167 .",
    "instead , it models the real physical properties of gmcs , @xmath168 , and @xmath29 remain within a modest range of values , @xmath169 @xcite . ] .    finally , it is important to note that the results presented in this section do not necessarily translate to disc galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "galaxies on the `` main - sequence '' of star formation rates at high-  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) still form stars at rates comparable to present - epoch mergers @xcite because they have very high gaseous surface densities , though they may be morphologically classified as discs @xcite .",
    "we now turn to  in galaxy mergers . before embarking on the remainder of this section ,",
    "it is important to emphasise that the many of the gmcs in the model starburst are resolved ( this is clear from the @xmath170 panel in figure  [ figure : xco_distribution ] ) .",
    "thus , the derived values for  are independent of subresolution assumptions .    during the merger",
    ", gas is funneled toward the nuclear regions , causing dense concentrations of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the surface densities of the gmcs in our simulations rise accordingly . in principle , this would cause a rise in the co-  conversion factor ( c.f .",
    "equation  [ equation : xco_units ] ) .",
    "however , during the merger - induced starburst , the increase in velocity - integrated line intensity exceeds the rise in surface density , causing  to drop from the galactic value .",
    "in figure  [ figure : xco_evolution ] , we show the evolution of the star formation rate , gas temperature , velocity dispersion and  as a function of time for the three model galaxy mergers .",
    "the shaded region denotes the range of mean values among the gmcs within the merger models at each timestep , i.e. at time 0 the lowest point outlined in gray corresponds to the lowest galaxy - averaged value of the three merger models , and the highest point in gray corresponds to the highest galaxy - averaged value among the three .",
    "the time axes are centred around the peak in the starburst for each model .",
    "when the galaxies merge , the discs are destroyed . during this time",
    ", the dominant contributor to @xmath29 within the gmcs is the nonthermal component derived from the local resolved velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "the nonthermal velocity dispersion is driven by the dynamics during the galaxy merger and mixing of stellar mass with the  gas .    during final coalescence in the merger ,",
    "when the sfr peaks at a few hundred , the fraction of dense gas rises , a result verified both in theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observations @xcite .",
    "the mass - weighted mean gmc density rises to roughly @xmath171 , compared to @xmath172  in the model disc . at these high densities ,",
    "the energy exchange between dust and gas becomes efficient , and the gas temperatures begin to approach the dust temperatures . at the same time , the dust is being heated by an amplified radiation field due to the merger - induced starburst .",
    "this is demonstrated explicitly in figure  [ figure : xco_distribution ] , where we show the dust and gas ( kinetic ) temperature distributions of the gmcs in the model galaxies .",
    "the mean gas temperature is higher by a factor of a few than the roughly @xmath2 k gmcs in the model disc .",
    "the rise in the gas kinetic temperature during the starburst is shown in figure  [ figure : xco_evolution ] as well - factor at various extinctions ) . ] .",
    "the large molecular gas densities in the merger also mean the co is thermalised in the ground state transition .",
    "when level populations are in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , their source function can be described by the planck function . in this limit",
    ", the source function rises with temperature .",
    "hence , the rise in gas kinetic temperature during the burst contributes to driving  down .",
    "the combination of the increased velocity dispersion and the brightness temperature combine to exceed the increase in surface density , which causes a depressed mean  from the galactic value during the merger .",
    "we now return to the first panel figure  [ figure : xco_distribution ] to explicitly compare  in the merger against the disc galaxy .",
    "we see that  has a broad distribution for the model merger .",
    "a number of gmcs outside of the nucleus are similar to the disc galaxy s in terms of their physical properties .",
    "these gmcs are unresolved in our simulations ( owing to the fact that they reside in lower - density environments ) , and thus take on surface density and velocity dispersion values comparable to those observed in the galaxy .",
    "however , the gmcs toward the centre of the galaxy all have larger surface densities , velocity dispersions , and kinetic temperatures . the latter two combine to depress  compared to the values seen in the disc by a factor of @xmath173 .",
    "because most of the mass in the merger is in the central regions , the luminosity - weighted mean is low .",
    "test simulations with fixed temperatures or velocity dispersions show that the increased kinetic temperature and velocity dispersion in the gas contribute roughly equally to the increased line intensity in the merger simulation .",
    "this is somewhat apparent from figure  [ figure : xco_distribution ] , where we see similar distributions values for the kinetic temperatures and velocity dispersions in the gas .",
    "the magnitude by which  decreases is dependent on the strength of the merger .",
    "turning to figure  [ figure : xco_evolution ] , we see a range in  values during the burst .",
    "the model with the largest  during the burst corresponds to the lowest peak sfr .",
    "a key point of this aspect of the model is that there is no `` merger value '' of :  depends on the physical parameters of the emitting galaxy .",
    "what happens in the post - starburst stage is also highly merger - specific . during this phase ,",
    "the galaxy is a gas - poor early type .",
    "generally , the gas has a large velocity dispersion for at least a dynamical time after the burst .",
    "this is consistent with what was seen in simulations of co gas in high-  submillimetre galaxies @xcite . during this phase",
    ", it is less trivial to simply relate the observed  to the gas velocity dispersion and temperature as there is a much larger dispersion in molecular gas fractions and co abundances .",
    "this owes to the fact that there are highly varying physical conditions in the post - burst galaxy , which drive strong variations in the  and co abundances .",
    "some of the simulations return to a galactic  value quickly , while others remain low",
    ".    in summary , during the merger - induced starburst ,  drops in galaxies from the standard galactic value due to increased gas temperatures and velocity dispersions . during this time , the co abundances are @xmath174/  and molecular gas fractions near unity in the main co emitting region . in the resulting gas - poor merger remnant , the dynamical and thermal history can vary from model to model , and the evolution of  is less uniform among mergers .      with the concepts presented in ",
    "[ section : xco_starbursts ] , we are now in a position to understand how  varies in galaxies as a function of spatial location . in figure",

    "the  values from figure  [ figure : xco_spatial_distribution ] come from the map in figure  [ figure : xco_map ] .",
    "the  values are binned in bins of distance , and represent the emission - weighted mean within a given distance bin .",
    "the bars denote the range of  values seen in a given distance bin .    in the centre of the model disc galaxy",
    "is systematically lower than in the rest of the galaxy . in particular , a number of gmcs along the line of sight have velocity dispersions larger than the typical virialised values , with values elevated by a factor of @xmath175 .",
    "similarly , due to the elevated densities in the nucleus combined with a warmer dust temperature , the gas temperatures of some gmcs can reach values up to 15 k. this causes  in the central kiloparsec to generally display the lowest values in the galaxy .",
    "depressed values of  from the galactic mean have been observed in at least a few gmcs toward the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the regions where @xmath176 represents much of the area , but a negligible fraction of the gas mass in the galaxy .",
    "this is evident from figure  [ figure : xco_distribution ] .    in the fiducial model merger , unlike the situation with the model disc galaxy , we see no clear trend in  with galactocentric radius . due to the violent nature of the gasdynamics during the merger , gas of a variety of physical conditions",
    "is mixed together .",
    "consequently , we see a large range of @xmath16-factors in the gmcs throughout the galaxy .",
    "because the emission from the merger is irregular , it is possible that by choosing a different centre , the results from figure  [ figure : xco_spatial_distribution ] would change . to test this , we recentered the image on the peak of the velocity - integrated intensity .",

    "shows a wide - range of values throughout the galaxy .",
    "[ figure : xco_spatial_distribution ] ]    we have presented a model in which  in gmcs is dependent on the physical conditions within the clouds . when the surface densities , kinetic temperatures and velocity dispersions within the gmcs resemble those of observed clouds in the galaxy , the resulting  factor is comparable to the observed galactic mean value . in starbursts , while the surface densities of clouds are higher , this is offset by both larger velocity dispersions in the gmcs as well as larger gas temperatures .",
    "the increased linewidths represent the turbulent velocity dispersion in the merger , as well as the stellar potential .",
    "the increased gas temperatures owe to efficient coupling with the dust at the high densities encountered in a merger .",
    "a fundamental point of this study is that the physical conditions which cause  to vary in starbursts are coupled .",
    "the same processes which drive the increased gas surface density also cause an increase in star formation rate which drives up the dust and consequently the gas temperatures .",
    "similarly , in a merger - driven burst , the gas velocity dispersion rises during the merger .    while it is of utmost importance to parameterise  in terms of observable properties , because the physical parameters which drive observed values of  are coupled , this is a nontrivial task which is outside the scope of this work ( though it will be investigated in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "empirically , there is a tentative trend that  decreases with increasing galaxy surface density @xcite . in the context of the models presented here ,",
    "such a trend is plausible ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "one might expect that higher surface density systems typically arise in situations when the velocity dispersion is high and the star formation rates , dust temperatures and gas temperatures are also high .",
    "while the models investigated here by no means comprise an exhaustive parameter - space study of galaxy masses , merger mass ratios , or merger orbits , we can investigate whether  can be parameterised by @xmath170 in the simulations . to increase the dynamic range of surface densities in our models , we include one additional simulation of a high - redshift merger .",
    "the merger is the model submillimetre galaxy of @xcite during the coalescence when the peak merger - induced starburst is @xmath177 .",

    "the galaxies are binned by @xmath170 .",
    "the trend seen is what is expected : that  should decrease with gas surface density . in principle",
    "this owes to the fact that the highest surface density galaxies in our simulations are also forming stars at @xmath179 , and have relatively large velocity dispersions .",
    "however , we emphasise strongly that figure  [ figure : xco_surfacedensity ] is to be taken as a qualitative trend , rather than robust",

    "work by the chicago group ( r. feldmann et al . in prep . ) is underway to investigate this .",

    "thus the relationship between our model results and the interpretation of high-  observations by @xcite and @xcite will depend on the distribution of surface densities in their observed galaxies , among other issues .",
    "we note , however , that our work , like that of @xcite , is consistent with the idea that the observed behaviour in the star formation rates and  can be explained without the need to invoke a volumetric star formation law that is different in discs and mergers .",
    "the change in  we see in our simulations occurs because of changes in the physical conditions of gmcs associated with the merger , and not because the underlying star formation law is different .",
    "finally , the concepts presented in this paper are testable in the near future with alma .",
    "our models suggest that high spatial resolution observations of nearby ulirgs will display both large velocity dispersions in the co gas , and larger brightness temperatures than those seen in observations of galactic gmcs on a comparable scale .",

    "these authours found that  would vary from the galactic value in cases of high kinetic temperature , high velocity dispersion or low metallicity .",
    "while not simultaneously modeling any of these effects , this model identified some of the most important driving factors in setting the observed @xmath16-factor in clouds .",
    "a number of other studies have also investigated  in models of giant molecular clouds .",

    "our simulations describe the ambient environment surrounding the model gmcs , though at best they resolve the surfaces of the clouds ( and require some amount of subresolution techniques ) .",
    "that both sets of models are converging upon the same result from different directions is encouraging .",

    "utilising a combination of hydrodynamic simulations of disc galaxy evolution and galaxy mergers , dust and molecular line radiative transfer calculations , we investigated the dependence of the co-  conversion factor on galactic environment .",
    "our main results follow :    1 .   provided that gmcs are gravitationally bound , disc galaxies in the local universe have relatively little influence on the physical properties of gmcs within them ( outside the central @xmath1 kpc ) .",
    "the velocity dispersions are typically dominated by internal processes to the gmc , and the temperatures are roughly constant at @xmath2 k , set by a balance of molecular / atomic line cooling and cosmic ray and grain photoelectric effect heating . in this situation ,",

    "2 .   in galaxy mergers , the gmc physical properties",
    "are strongly affected by the galaxy environment .",
    "the rise in surface density in gmcs during the merger is offset by an increase in the velocity dispersion coupled to a rise in the kinetic temperature of the gas caused by efficient dust - gas thermal exchange at high densities .",
    "the combination of increased velocity dispersion and kinetic temperature increases the co intensity , and lowers the observed  from the galactic value by a typical factor of @xmath5 .",
    "3 .   there is a slight trend with galactocentric radius such that gmcs toward the centres of disc galaxies will have a lower  than the disc - averaged value , owing to both increased velocity dispersions in the clouds , as well as higher kinetic temperatures .",

    "in   [ section : methods ] , we outlined a number of parameter choices which could potentially influence the results in this paper . here , we discuss the results in the context of these assumptions .",
    "first , there is a discrepancy between the way the dust temperature is calculated in  and in our temperature equilibrium model . in the former ,",
    "the dust temperature is assumed to be in equilibrium with the radiation field , but we do not take into account any thermal exchange between the gas and dust . in the temperature equilibrium model , the dust grains",
    "are assumed to be able to exchange energy with the gas , but we hold the ambient radiation field fixed , rather than allowing it to change as the dust temperature does . given the importance of the dust temperature in raising the gas temperature in this model , it is worth investigating any potential differences between the two dust temperatures .    in figure",
    "[ figure : dusttemp_contour ] , we plot the ratio of @xmath190 from  compared to @xmath191 from the temperature equilibrium model as a function of gmc density for our fiducial merger . there is generally good agreement between the two , though some number of points at higher densities deviate strongly from unity .",
    "the gas which has poor agreement between the two dust temperature calculations almost exclusively has all of its carbon in atomic form , rather than molecular . beyond this",
    ", this gas tends to be towards the outskirts of the galaxy , in rather large cells in the adaptive mesh with relatively low masses ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "because we enforce a rule that clouds must have a minimum surface density of 100  pc@xmath166 , these regions have extremely high densities , even if relatively low mass . in atomic gas of this density , the gas couples with the dust and can cause the dust temperature to change from that of the background radiation field .",
    "these outlying points have little effect on the final results , however , as they contain rather little mass .",
    "we denote the 95th mass percentile by the blue shaded region in figure  [ figure : dusttemp_contour ] .",
    "that is , the sum of the mass in the points outside of the blue region accounts for @xmath193 of the total molecular mass in the galaxy .",
    "as is shown , the differences in the two dust temperatures are small in this shaded region .",
    "similarly , a number of our assumptions in the  modeling can have an effect on the derived dust temperature .",
    "we investigate those here .",
    "the important figure for these tests is figure  [ figure : dusttemp_distribution.lowres ] .",
    "referring to   [ section : sunrise ] , the time - averaged covering fraction of birthclouds around stellar clusters is a free parameter . while we chose a modest covering fraction",
    ", it is possible that a larger fraction may be reasonable .",
    "for example , if we choose a fraction @xmath194 , the o and b stars would be blanketed by the ism for their entire lives .",
    "this situation may exist in ulirgs . to test for the effect in varying @xmath195",
    ", we plot the ratio of the dust temperatures derived from  for a model with @xmath196 over the dust temperature from our fiducial model with @xmath118 against gmc density .",
    "the blue shaded region shows the 95th mass percentile , and grey denotes the 99th mass percentile .",
    "the model with a larger clearing timescale for the birthclouds has cooler dust temperatures as less uv flux interacts with the ism .",
    "however , the differences in dust temperature are generally within a factor of 50% , and much less than that ( @xmath197 ) when considering the bulk of the mass of the galaxy .",
    "we conclude that the pdr covering fraction is not an important driver in our model results .",
    "we can explore the effect of discarding the pdr birthcloud model , and assuming the cold ism has a uniform volume filling fraction . in this case",
    ", the uv photons escape the star particles easily , though optical depths for the photons in the ism are large . for some number of the clouds outside of the nuclear region , the dust temperatures are thus colder than in our fiducial model ( the low ratio points in figure  [ figure : dusttemp_distribution.lowres ] ) .",
    "however , the bulk of the gas mass is in a confined nuclear region in the galaxy which sees the intense uv radiation field .",
    "because of this , this dust is heated well , and has comparable dust temperatures to our fiducial model .",
    "the dispersion in dust temperatures is again within 50% , and the 95th% percentile of mass shows relatively small discrepancies .",
    "it is possible that the agn in the model merger contributes strongly to the dust temperature . to test this",
    ", we investigate a model where we have turned off the contribution of the agn in determining the dust temperature in the merger . while it is difficult to see by eye , the dust temperatures in the model with the agn are hotter than the model with no agn . by and large , however , the agn is not powerful enough to have a significant effect on the overall temperature structure of the cold ism as noted by the blue and grey shaded regions .",
    "we now turn to possible parameters in the hydrodynamics simulations which may affect our results . as described in   [ section : sph ]",
    ", we make a number of parameter choices which may affect the star formation history of the model galaxies .",
    "because the gas densities and dust and gas temperature can depend on these assumptions , it is worth exploring the robustness of our model results in the context of these choices .",
    "there are two principle parameter choices which govern the physical state of the ism in our hydrodynamic modes : the star formation `` law '' , and the equation of state . as discussed in ",
    "[ section : sph ] , we adopt a star formation law such that the star formation time scale is assumed to be proportional to the local dynamical timescale , and whose rate matches the normalisation of the locally observed @xcite relation .    in the absence of a complete theory of star formation ,",
    "a number of possible choices exist regarding the implementation of a star formation recipe on subresolution scales .",
    "one can imagine a similar kennicutt - schmidt solution , though with an index of unity as appears to be observed on resolved scales in nearby galaxies @xcite , or steeper index as tentative observational @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence motivates at high - redshift . beyond this , more sophisticated physical models may provide reasonable prescriptions for star formation in galaxy evolution models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while it is outside the scope of this study to perform a detailed study of various star formation recipes in , we perform some simple tests to investigate the role of our adopted star formation law in driving the simulated  factors .    in the table",
    ", we show the luminosity - weighted mean  values for our fiducial merger during the peak of their starburst for a variety of input parameters in our  simulations .",
    "the kennicutt - schmidt index=2 case shows a comparable  value as the fiducial merger .",
    "while the burst is moderately diminished ( owing to rapid consumption of the gas during early phases of the merger s evolution , though still quite large at @xmath198 as opposed to @xmath199 in the fiducial merger ) , the large stellar mass upon coalescence maintains a large velocity dispersion in the gas .",
    "this drives a low mean .",
    "the model with the largest impact on our results is the model with kennicutt - schmidt index=1 ; this model merger has a mean  comparable to the model disc .",
    "models with a ks index of 1 do not go through a burst upon merging ( t. cox , private communication ) . with a ks index of 1 , to first order , the total star formation rate is proportional to the total gas mass . because we do nt include any gas replenishment from the intergalactic medium , the gas mass only decreases with time , as does the sfr in this simulation .",
    "the low sfr upon merging leads to low gas / dust temperatures , and increased .",
    "we note that this situation is unlikely to describe real mergers as , observationally , galaxy mergers exhibit the highest star formation rates in the local universe .",
    "both observational @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence suggest that a ks index @xmath200 may describe high - surface density systems .",
    "we utilise an equation of state for the ism which incorporates a subresolution prescription for capturing the effect of supernovae heating of the ism @xcite .",
    "the nominal @xcite and @xcite eos is given by :      where @xmath202 as the adiabatic index of the gas , @xmath203 is the density of the hot and cold phase , and @xmath204 is the specific thermal energy of the two phases . for a given imf , @xcite",
    "show that the eos is completely defined by the star formation time scale , the normalisation of the cloud evaporation rate , and a supernovae `` temperature '' which defines the heating rate from supernovae of a given imf .",
    "the full `` effective '' eos has the property in which pressure rises with density faster than an isothermal gas , as can be seen in figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "our fiducial model utilises a softer eos than the full model .",
    "in particular , we interpolate between the full `` stiff '' model ( where we assign a parameter @xmath205 ) and isothermal model ( @xmath206 ) and employ @xmath38 . in the full `` stiff '' eos as in simulations of discs scaled for the local universe , the ism can become so pressurised as to appear smooth with relatively few clumps @xcite . to test our assumption of a softer eos",
    ", we have run a test simulation with = 1 .    in the table",
    ", we show the mean  for our fiducial merger , though with = 1 ( denoted `` stiff eos '' ) .",
    "we see a larger value than the fiducial model .",
    "isolating the root cause is nontrivial . by effectively increasing the effect of supernovae feedback , we increase dust heating ( by reducing the clumpiness of the gas ) , though we also reduce the magnitude of the burst ( due to a retardation of gas fragmentation ) .",
    "these effects serve to somewhat offset one another with respect to the gas temperature .",
    "we test whether our assumption of @xmath207 outside of clouds plays a strong role in our model results .",
    "following @xcite , we have run a model in which we scale the interstellar radiation field by the value of the local sfr compared to that in the solar neighbourhood , and show the mean  value in the table ( denoted by `` oml g - scaling '' ) . because the clouds are strongly shielded in this model",
    ", scaling @xmath208 makes little difference .",
    "finally , we consider the spatial resolution of our model .",
    "our current resolution has cell sizes ( @xmath209 pc ) which are of order the sph smoothing length .",
    "further increasing the spatial resolution does not provide new physical information .",
    "more seriously , increasing the spatial resolution of the sph simulations would run into scenarios of unphysical descriptions of the ism with the @xcite multiphase model .",
    "we can see , however , what direction the results may go if it were possible to increase our resolution . to investigate this , we have run our fiducial merger snapshot with one less level of refinement in the adaptive mesh , giving a minimum cell size of @xmath210pc , and show the mean  in the table ( denoted by `` half - res '' ) .",
    "the mean  in the low resolution model is 60%  the value of the fiducial model .",
    "it is conceivable , then , that further increasing the spatial resolution would increase  in the merger model . on the other hand , reducing the cell size would result in more resolved gmcs . because it is the resolved gmcs that drive the mean  for the merger model",
    ", it is also possible that increased spatial resolution would result in little change to the results presented here ."
