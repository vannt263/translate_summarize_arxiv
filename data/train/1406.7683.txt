    "let @xmath0 be a polynomial map such that its jacobian determinant , @xmath9 , is nowhere zero in @xmath4 . by the inverse function theorem , @xmath3 is locally injective .",
    "the _ real jacobian conjecture _ asserts that @xmath3 is globally injective .",
    "this is closely related to the famous _",
    "jacobian conjecture _ , which claims that given @xmath10 a field of characteristic zero , any polynomial map from @xmath11 to @xmath11 such that its jacobian determinant is equal to @xmath12 is injective .",
    "jacobian conjecture was stated at the first time in 1939 by keller ( @xcite ) and up to now is open if @xmath13 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further informations on jacobian conjecture .",
    "the real jacobian conjecture is nevertheless not true : in 1994 , pinchuk constructed , in @xcite , a non injective polynomial map @xmath8 such that @xmath14 in @xmath4 . in this example , the polynomials @xmath1 and @xmath6 have high degrees : @xmath1 has degree @xmath15 and @xmath6 has degree @xmath16 .",
    "since the injectivity of @xmath3 is clear when the degree of @xmath3 is one ( in this case @xmath3 is an affine change of coordinates ) , it is natural to ask what would be the highest degree of @xmath1 or @xmath6 guaranteeing the global injectivity of @xmath3 .    in this direction ,",
    "gwodziewicz proved , in @xcite , that if the degrees of @xmath1 and @xmath6 are less than or equal to @xmath17 then @xmath3 is injective . in @xcite , braun and santos generalized gwodziewicz result proving that the injectivity of @xmath3 is true provided just the degree of @xmath1 being less than or equal to @xmath17 .",
    "thus a natural question is : what is the maximum degree of @xmath1 , between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , in order that the injectivity of @xmath3 is necessary independently of the degree of @xmath6 ? as a partial answer to this question , we prove in this note the following result .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath0 be a polynomial map such that @xmath14 in @xmath4 .",
    "if the degree of @xmath1 is less than or equal to @xmath2 , then @xmath3 is injective .",
    "since the assumption `` @xmath14 in @xmath4 '' gives that @xmath6 is strictly monotone along each connected component of a level set of @xmath1 ( as the level sets of @xmath6 are transversal to the level sets of @xmath1 ) , one strategy to show the injectivity of @xmath3 is to prove that the level sets of @xmath1 are all connected .",
    "actually , since injective polynomial maps are bijections ( see @xcite ) , this is also necessary to the injectivity of @xmath3 .",
    "thus to prove theorem [ main ] it is enough to consider all the polynomial submersions @xmath1 with disconnected level sets and to show that for these there is not a polynomial @xmath6 such that @xmath14 in @xmath4 . before continuing ,",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section_common_zeros ] ,",
    "we use subresultants of two polynomials to develop results to decide when two special polynomials in @xmath37 $ ] have common zeros .",
    "these special polynomials have the form of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath1 is a polynomials of degree @xmath2 . in section [ section_level_sets ] ,",
    "we construct results to decide when a special polynomial submersion has all its level sets connected .",
    "then in section [ section_classification ] , we use the results of sections [ section_common_zeros ] and [ section_level_sets ] to prove theorem [ classification ] .    in section [ quase_final ] , we will consider the polynomials of theorem [ classification ] and prove that for each of them there is not a polynomial @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , for all @xmath42 .",
    "for the arguments we shall use the concept of half - reeb component of a foliation .",

    "when we analyse the polynomial [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] , these techniques no longer work .",
    "thus we transform part of the problem in being able to decide when a special polynomial of one variable is positive .",

    "the following result is classical but we include a proof of it for the sake of completeness .",
    "our proof was based on @xcite .",

    "since @xmath66 is a complex number with does not depend on @xmath67 , it follows that @xmath1 and @xmath6 have a common root if and only if @xmath68 .",
