    "that is , the tangent line at the body 3 also passes through the point @xmath0 . since @xmath34 , it is obvious that if two tangent lines are parallel , the third line is also parallel to the other two lines .",
    "[ three normals ] if the linear momentum is zero and the moment of inertia is constant , three normal lines at the bodies meet at a point or three normal lines are parallel .",

    "( large grey triangle ) and the triangle whose perimeters are @xmath8 ( small grey triangle ) are inversely similar .",
    ", width=192 ]    * proof : * since @xmath34 , vectors @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 form a triangle . by the theorem [ circumcircle ] ,",
    "points @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath0 are on the circumcircle .",
    "then , the angles denoted by @xmath48 in are identical .",
    "the angles denoted by @xmath49 are also identical .",
    "we use the following notations @xmath50 and take the centre of mass to be the origin @xmath51    now let us prove the equation . let @xmath52 be the ratio of magnification @xmath53 here @xmath54 , and we always use this convention when indexes @xmath55 appear in one equation .",
    "then we get @xmath56 which leads to @xmath57 i.e. , the equation and @xmath58    now , consider the oriented area of the `` synchronised similar triangles '' . since the two triangles are inversely similar , we get the equation as follows @xmath59 where we have used the relation of @xmath60 which follows from @xmath61 .",

    ", @xmath4 can not be zero if @xmath108 and @xmath105 .",

    "moreover , if the angular momentum is zero , then by the use of the equation , @xmath112 can be expressed by the momentum @xmath113 , @xmath114 then the equations or yields @xmath115 the right - hand sides of the above equations are constant for all @xmath48 .",
    "note that for @xmath109 , @xmath116 is also constant along the orbit . thus we get the equation . as a consequence of this equation",
    ", @xmath117 can not be zero if @xmath108 , meaning that the bodies can not stop .    for @xmath105",
    ", the orbit of @xmath118 and @xmath103 is strictly constrained by the condition for @xmath18 and @xmath30 to be constant and the condition . for @xmath119 ,",
    "on the other hand , the condition is relatively loose and actually the figure - eight orbit shown in is that with @xmath118 and @xmath103 .",
    "the similarity for the momentum space and the force space also holds .",
    "this is interesting , but this similarity does not produce any new information .    differentiate the equation with respect to @xmath120 , we get @xmath121 where @xmath122 represents the force acting on the body @xmath123 . substituting the equation into the above equation",
    ", we get @xmath124 on the other hand , we have the following equality @xmath125 which is proved by substituting the equations of motion into the forces @xmath126 and showing that l.h.s .",
    "becomes @xmath127    let @xmath128 and @xmath129 then , the equations @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and are rewritten as @xmath132 by the theorem [ algebraic ] , the triangle whose vertexes are @xmath133 , and the triangle whose perimeters are @xmath134 , are the `` synchronised similar triangles '' .",
    "they are always inversely similar .",
    "however , this similarity gives no new information , because they are equivalent to the similarity in @xmath135 variables .",
    "in this section , we consider general three - body orbits with @xmath118 , but not with the assumption of @xmath103 . even in this case , we can find the `` synchronised similar triangles '' .",

    "we can easily verify the following equalities for the scaled variables , @xmath136 by the theorem [ algebraic ] , triangle whose vertexes are @xmath137 , and triangle whose perimeters are @xmath138 , are the `` synchronised similar triangles '' .",

    "@xmath68 , we have useful equalities for @xmath118 and @xmath140 orbits . for example , the equality for the scaled variables @xmath141 yields the equality , since @xmath142",

    "we do not assume @xmath103 .",
    "we derive an equation of motion for the oriented area defined by the positions @xmath7 of three bodies , and prove that any three - body orbits with @xmath118 under the potential @xmath102 with @xmath32 have infinitely many syzygies or collisions .",
    "let @xmath143 be the oriented area and @xmath144 be twice of the oriented area of the triangle defined by @xmath7 , @xmath145 and the origin .",

    "now , let us prove that the function @xmath154 or equivalently @xmath155 has infinitely many zeros for @xmath32 .",
    "note that the zeros of @xmath154 and @xmath156 are one to one .",
    "there are three cases when they take zero : syzygy without collision , two - body collision and triple collision @xmath157 .",

    "montgomery proved this property making use of the equation of motion for @xmath33 .",
    "we give here another proof from a different point of view .",
    "our proof consists of three steps .",
    "the first step : eliminate the first derivative term @xmath158 in the equation . to do this",
    ", we consider the equation for @xmath156 instead of @xmath154 .",
    "then , the equation is equivalent to @xmath159 where we have used two identities @xmath160 and for @xmath161 . the second step : write the equation as @xmath162 and show that @xmath163 is bounded from below by a positive constant @xmath164 for @xmath32 .",
    "the following inequalities hold @xmath165 where we have used an inequality that @xmath166 and @xmath167 . the symbol @xmath168 represents the minimum value of @xmath169 .",
    "then , we get the following inequality @xmath170 where we have used the fact that the orbit is bounded @xmath171 .",
    "the last step : since the restoring force for @xmath156 is always stronger than that of a harmonic oscillator with @xmath172 , it is natural to expect that @xmath156 has infinitely many zeros and intervals of zeros are shorter than @xmath173 . to prove this we show that for any initial conditions @xmath174 and @xmath175 , the function @xmath156 vanishes before @xmath176 .",
    "let us consider a harmonic oscillator @xmath177 which has the period @xmath178 and satisfies the same initial conditions as @xmath156 , @xmath179 define a function @xmath180 by @xmath181 then , the first derivative with respect to @xmath120 yields @xmath182 without loss of generality , we can take @xmath183 .",
    "let @xmath184 be the first time when @xmath177 vanishes .",
    "then we have @xmath185 and @xmath186 . to derive a contradiction ,",
    "suppose that @xmath187 for @xmath188 .",

    "since @xmath190 and @xmath191 , integration of the equation yields @xmath192 since @xmath193 , we get @xmath194 , which is a contradiction . therefore , @xmath156 must have zero before @xmath195 .",
    "this work may give rich information for some related problems .",
    "the first one is to investigate the nature of the figure - eight solution under @xmath3 potential which has zero angular momentum and constant moment of inertia .",
    "we hope that the equalities , and would be useful for further understanding of the figure - eight solution under this potential .",
    "the second problem is to find a conceptual proof of chenciner s problem 13 in his lecture at taiyuan  @xcite .",
    "consider the figure - eight solution under the homogeneous or logarithmic potential energy @xmath102 .",
    "chenciner s problem is the following : _ show that the moment of inertia of the `` eight '' stays constant only when @xmath119 .",
    "_ in the equal - masses three - body problem , ffo  @xcite showed that a motion satisfying the following three conditions exists under the potentials @xmath102 if and only if @xmath196 .",
    "the conditions are ( i ) @xmath118 , ( ii ) @xmath103 and ( iii ) one body passes through the centre of mass . then ffo explicitly proved that the orbits for @xmath197 are not the figure - eight .",
    "this solves chenciner s problem .",
    "but the method of ffo was a kind of `` brute - force '' one , in which they calculated the derivative of the moment of inertia with respect to time to the eighth order explicitly . a more `` conceptual '' proof would be appreciated .",
    "the present work shows what will happen if @xmath118 and @xmath103 orbit exist for @xmath102 with @xmath105 . as discussed in the section [ sec_homopot ] ,",
    "these orbits are strictly constrained .",
    "the third problem is to understand the nature of three - body orbits with zero angular momentum under various potential energy @xmath102 .",
