    "great excitement was caused by the observation by the cdf collaboration of a large apparent peak in @xmath0 that was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to be the result of a gaussian peak sitting on top of the @xmath0 continuum background . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated how an existing excess in the cdf measurement of single - top - quark production would translate into the @xmath0 signal region , and fit the apparent excess , assuming it was a fluctuation of single - top - quark production .",
    "we concentrated in that paper on single - top - quark production , rather than @xmath6 production , because of a statement in the cdf paper that the @xmath6 contribution had been fit to data , but single - top had only been modeled by monte carlo .",
    "this proceedings constitutes a significant update to ref.@xcite that clearly demonstrates the excesses in @xmath0 and in the single - top measurements are the same . unlike our paper , we are now able to show that no corrections to single - top are required to fit the data .",
    "what is less clear is whether the events are physically due to single - top , @xmath6 , or most likely a combination of many things .",
    "while we do not solve all problems , we demonstrate these anomalies reside solely within the cdf data , and reclassify the issues as a result of an anomaly in the number of @xmath2-tagged jets in the @xmath0 sample .    in order to clearly identify where the real discrepancies exist ,",
    "we first reexamine the data to learn more about the @xmath0 anomaly , and then show its resolution . in section [ sec : jets ] , we point out that the cdf data set strongly suggests that the excess is partly due to a feed down effect of the @xmath7-jet sample into the @xmath3-jet sample .",
    "the heart of this update is section [ sec : fits ] , where we refit the cdf data with single - top as extracted from data @xcite , and compare to the fit in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we explore several problems with the original cdf fit that all disappear under the assumption the excess is pure single - top .",
    "we also demonstrate that an identical prediction for d@xmath5  perfectly fits their data set . finally , in section [ sec : what ] we conclude by addressing the question again of whether the apparent excess is single top or something else .",
    "as additional tests have been performed on the cdf data set to try to pin down the source of the @xmath0 excess , we have attempted to place these results in context . in particular , one measurement by cdf provides an essential clue as to the source of the excess . in fig.[fig : lowercut ] we overlay two data sets on top of each other : the original @xmath0 sample from the cdf paper , and the cdf @xmath0 sample where the definition of a jet was loosened to @xmath8 gev from the original @xmath9 gev @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath10 cut is removed in the looser set .     for @xmath0 , where jets are defined to have @xmath9 gev ( solid red ) and @xmath8 gev ( dashed blue ) .",
    "[ fig : lowercut ] , width=351 ]    when first looking at this figure , it seems that perhaps there is a mistake in the data .",
    "the bins with more tightly defined jets have systematically _ more _ events than the bins with more loosely defined jets above 100 gev .",
    "if the looser jets were a super - sample , this would not be possible , and this would indicate a clear inconsistency .",
    "after some consideration , however , it is apparent the looser defined jets are only a _ partial _ super - set of the tighter jets . in particular , because this is an exclusive 2-jet final state , by lowering the threshold for jet acceptance , several 3-jet events that had a jet between 2030 gev are thrown away .",
    "the conclusion is that , assuming this data is correct , a significant portion of the excess appears to be coming from proto 3-jet events that are sneaking in to the 2-jet sample because of the effectively weaker jet veto .",
    "this is consistent with the cdf check that a more inclusive sample ( allowing in 3 jets ) did not change the result , because the relevant 3-jet events were already there .",
    "as we ll see below , this is what we see in single - top as well .",
    "in order to track down what could have faked a peak in the 120160 gev , we investigated the influence of several effects : jet energy resolution , sensitivity to particular cuts , etc . in our initial paper @xcite",
    "we thought we might need strong assumptions about these effects to explain what was going on .",
    "it has turned out we do not . after more thorough investigation we find that _",
    "absolutely no corrections _ are required to explain the excess as anything but single - top .",
    "hence , we hold off until sec.[sec : what ] any mention of the role of jet energy resolution effects , etc .",
    ", as we now find they are not needed .    using shapes from pure vanilla madevent , and normalizations from the cdf fit to single - top",
    ", we can perfectly explain not only the excess between 120160 , but in fact the entire region 28300 gev .",
    "we find our fits solve several problems with the initial cdf fits that were not emphasized before , but indicate a more complex story than just an excess in the 120160 gev region . in subsec .",
    "[ ssec : cdffit ] we reexamine the cdf sample and point out some statistical problems with the cdf fit .",
    "we then add our estimate of single - top in subsec.[ssec : stfit ] , and demonstrate the problems vanish .",
    "finally , we show our fit to d@xmath5  in subsec .",
    "[ ssec : dzero ] .      in order to make a quantitative statement about how top explains the excess , we start by extracting the data from ref .",
    "@xcite for three sources : the measured data , the @xmath11 diboson peak , and the rest of the background fit ( which includes everything else : @xmath0 , @xmath6 fit to data , single - top from monte carlo , and other smaller components ) .",
    "we then proceed to look at the remainder of the data after subtracting all backgrounds from the measurement .",
    "the result appears in fig.[fig : cdfsubbase ] .     for remainder after subtracting all backgrounds from the data .",
    "[ fig : cdfsubbase ] , width=360 ]    what is readily apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfsubbase ] ( more so than fig .",
    "1 of the cdf paper which leaves in dibosons ) is that there is a systematic problem with the @xmath12 shape across the entire spectrum , from 28300 gev . in particular , the _ deficit _ of events below @xmath11 threshold is more worrisome than the excess between 120160 gev .",
    "however , we see that the excess in fact exists everywhere from 84300 gev",
    ". already we can perceive that we will want a broad kinematic distribution to fix this , but that is discussed in the next subsection .    to explore this a bit more",
    ", we perform the @xmath13 fit on the data we extract to quantify the quality of the background fit .",
    "when fitting over 28200 gev we get a @xmath14 .",
    "it is not surprising the fit is poor , as it is already clear from fig.[fig : cdfsubbase ] that the data does not follow a gaussian statistical distribution .",
    "we emphasize this point in fig.[fig : cdfstats ] , where we plot the distribution of residual errors and compare it to a gaussian .",
    "the data exhibits significant positive skew and kurtosis  i.e. , there is a missing systematic effect .",
    "the cdf paper attempted to solve this by adding a gaussian peak and refloating the background and signal fits . a simple count of the number of points above and below the fit with a gaussian still shows a massive skew ( 14/30 points are at least @xmath15 above the fit )  hence",
    ", it will not be a good fit either .",
    "the need for exotic partial corrections disappears below , so we will not dwell on the gaussian hypothesis .",
    ", width=360 ]    in conclusion , it is clear that the backgrounds considered in the analysis do not fit the data , despite their normalizations being floated .",
    "as we are about to see , this is solved by adding single - top as extracted from data .      in order to quantify the effect of translating the cdf single - top measurement into the @xmath0 channel",
    ", we do the following : we run @xmath16-channel and @xmath17-channel single - top in madevent , producing both @xmath0 and @xmath18 final states .",
    "@xmath18 is an nlo correction to lo , but was separately extracted by cdf in their single - top fit .",
    "we apply all of the same cuts as the cdf paper , and produce @xmath12 for each sample . in the case of @xmath18 ,",
    "many events are killed by the jet veto , but not all . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mjjmodes ] we show the shapes for each channel , based on the number of jets initially produced .",
    "note the shapes are all about the same . in fact , under unit normalization , the shapes are nearly identical , with 2-jet @xmath16-channel slightly harder above 200 gev , and 2-jet @xmath17-channel slightly softer below 80 gev .    - and @xmath17-channel contributions to @xmath0 after all cuts from initial 2-jet and 3-jet samples multiplied by @xmath19-factors extracted from cdf single - top data . [",
    "fig : mjjmodes ] , width=351 ]    the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : mjjmodes ] are normalized to ref .",
    "@xcite , and the supporting web page , which _ did not _ find the predicted standard model - like ratio of these modes .",
    "in particular , @xmath17-channel production was extracted in the cdf analysis as being @xmath20 the expected size in 2-jets , and @xmath21 in 3-jets , and @xmath16-channel production was found to be too large by a factor of @xmath22 in 2-jets , and @xmath23 in 3-jets .",
    "an essential point is that this is the same raw data set that @xmath0 was drawn from  the same trigger , and almost the same integrated luminosity .    we want to see what the cdf single - top data set predicts for @xmath0 , so we do the following :    1 .",
    "we first remove a standard model size prediction for single - top from the cdf background estimate we extract from their paper ( call this @xmath24 for residual ) .",
    "we use nlo @xmath19-factors ( which have been checked in the past after cuts ) of 1 for @xmath17-channel and @xmath25 for @xmath16-channel @xcite .",
    "we refit the data using a minimal @xmath13 test on three samples : 1 .",
    "@xmath26  all backgrounds as predicted by cdf except for dibosons and single - top .",
    "2 .   @xmath27  @xmath11 dibosons .",
    "@xmath28single - top  where we add @xmath29 to match the ratios extracted by cdf .",
    "3 .   compare @xmath30 , @xmath2 , @xmath31 to 1 , and to the cdf fit .",
    "before we show the results , a word on these fits . while we have chosen to use the ratio extracted from cdf , we immediately notice that the deficit in @xmath17-channel 2-jet is largely cancelled by the excess in @xmath17-channel 3-jet , leaving us mostly sensitive to additional @xmath16-channel .",
    "however , as the shapes are all about the same , and the quoted cdf single - top errors are large ( 5080% ) , it is easily conceivable that there could be a different mixture in the sample .",
    "we choose the ratio observed by cdf to perform our fit , but in the end , we are really just fitting a shape .",
    "it turns out the normalization is also perfectly consistent .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : datavfits ] we compare the cdf fit to the data with the the new best fit using @xmath32 single - top as extracted from data .",
    "it is clear that the fit including single - top is now consistent everywhere from 28300 gev .",
    "our fit of the cdf @xmath33 of @xmath34 improves to @xmath35 ( we fit 30 points with 3 variables ) .",
    "our best fit finds we need @xmath36 as much @xmath24 and @xmath37 as was required in the cdf fit , but as those normalizations were floated in the cdf fit as well , it is not a surprise .",
    "data with cdf fit ( red dashed ) , and fit with single - top extracted from cdf data ( blue solid ) . [",
    "fig : datavfits ] , width=351 ]    to stress that the residual is statistically removed , we compare the background subtracted data before and after the new fit in fig.[fig : subnew ] .",
    "the red line represents the central values of the original baseline cdf subtracted data , and the blue error bars represent what remains after subtracting the new background fit .",
    "the systematic deficit(excess ) below(above ) @xmath37 is gone .",
    ", width=360 ]    before , the distribution of residual errors in the cdf fit did not have an obvious statistical distribution .",
    "we see in fig.[fig : newstats ] that after adding data - derived single - top , the distribution of errors is a textbook sampling of a gaussian distribution .",
    "hence , we have solved both the normalization issue , but , more importantly , all shape issues from , 28300 gev .",
    "we consider this extremely strong evidence that the excesses in the cdf single - top sample and in @xmath0 have the same origin .",
    "the @xmath0 excess is perfectly explained by the shape of single - top .",
    "whether this _ is _ single - top , we ll address more below , but the excess is @xmath0 is almost certainly a kinematic shoulder , and not a resonant particle .",
    ", width=360 ]    in case some are uncomfortable with using @xmath32 the central value of extraction of single - top , we point out this is only @xmath38 above the central value .",
    "nevertheless , we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : chisqfits ] that using @xmath39 the central value gives @xmath40 .",
    "interestingly , almost any increase above the baseline monte carlo prediction for something with the shape of single - top dramatically improves the @xmath33 .",
    "we find from fitting the published cdf data ( including @xmath41 the standard model prediction of single - top ) , and from adding @xmath28 single - top as extracted from the cdf data set.[fig : chisqfits ] , width=360 ]      in our paper @xcite we made a prediction that d@xmath5would see ( at most ) a very small excess in @xmath0 because their early single - top data agreed almost perfectly with the standard model prediction .",
    "since that time , d@xmath5  has released a paper @xcite claiming that their data is consistent with no excess .",
    "while that is statistically true , d@xmath5   actually does have a modest excess in @xmath17-channel production .",
    "specifically , d@xmath5  has found @xmath42 @xmath17-channel , and @xmath43 @xmath16-channel in ref .",
    "strangely , this small excess goes in exactly the _ opposite _ direction as the cdf excess .",
    "however , we thought it would be useful to use the same procedure to check our prediction for d@xmath5 .",
    "the result is that the @xmath33 goes from @xmath44 to @xmath45 with no change to the required amount of @xmath37 ( @xmath46 ) , slightly less @xmath24 ( @xmath47 ) , and @xmath48 single - top as extracted from the d@xmath5  measurement .",
    "not much was expected or needed , but interestingly , the fit is best with almost the same increase in single - top as cdf . obviously this is well within errors . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dzero ] one can see that above @xmath37 threshold adding a little more single - top is just as consistent as that predicted by the d@xmath5  monte carlo .",
    "hence , this is a suggestive consistency check , but is not statistically powerful enough to help understand the cdf anomaly .    data with and without additional single - top .",
    "[ fig : dzero ] , width=351 ]",
    "we have been very careful to state that the cdf excess in @xmath0 is fully explainable by something with the kinematic shape of single - top , and normalization that fits the criteria of the cdf single - top measurement excess , but we have been careful not to claim we can prove it _ is _ single - top .",
    "the burning question is : what is it ?",
    "initially , we made it clear we were not considering @xmath6 production solely because the cdf paper claimed to have fit it in data , and properly accounted for it . given our observation that 3-jet events feeding into 2-jet events is playing at least some role , this may need to be revisited .",
    "how well do we understand the sample of @xmath6 under these exact cuts ?",
    "we can not answer that theoretically .",
    "it requires deep access to the internal procedures used to fit @xmath6 in the first place .",
    "once thing we can show , however , is that the some of the kinematic shapes in @xmath6 are compatible with the single - top shape .",
    "there are _ many _",
    "@xmath6 final states that could be feeding into the @xmath0 analysis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tt ] we choose to focus on one : @xmath49 .",
    "this process could be playing a role , as @xmath50s are often reconstructed as jets .",
    "further , they represent only one particle to miss .",
    "@xmath6 certainly has 2 @xmath2 jets , which an excess of could help partially explain the anomalously large sample of 2 @xmath2-tag events in the single - top analysis .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : tt ] , we split out the contributions to @xmath0 from @xmath53 and @xmath54 to point out that the shapes are significantly different .",
    "the shape of @xmath53 is almost identical to that of @xmath16-channel production ( though @xmath6 is intrinsically smaller in this channel , there are other possible decay modes ) .",
    "@xmath54 falls sharply near 150 gev .",
    "it seems likely that a fit that allowed some additional @xmath51 would also fit the data . however , there are not enough degrees of freedom in the data we have to trust such a fit .",
    "so where does this leave the question ?",
    "the answer is likely that the excess is due to a combination of top - quark initiated backgrounds plus something else not understood .",
    "it is in the part that is not understood that we feel is where the emphasis should be placed .",
    "having tied together the single - top measurement anomaly and the @xmath0 excess leaves us with a strange quandary : the cdf @xmath0 data has too many @xmath55-tag events , too many @xmath56-tag events , and not nearly enough @xmath57-tag events in this simple kinematic region .",
    "if anything , one would expect that a missed @xmath2-tag would lead to an excess in the @xmath57-tag sample at the expense of the @xmath56-tag sample .",
    "the size of the effect seems large to be purely statistical , but that is a detail of the data set that cdf will have to study internally .",
    "nevertheless , we feel the solution to this whole conundrum is tied to explaining this more general discrepancy .    as a final comment on the @xmath2-tag issue : we had suggested looking for excess @xmath2-tags in the @xmath0 sample early on in this investigation . the only cdf analysis and plot we have seen claims that @xmath2 s can not be playing a role because the number of @xmath2 tags between 120160 is fractionally the same as outside that region .",
    "given that a single - top excess exists across the entire 28300 gev region , that is exactly what we would have predicted .",
    "the question is one of total absolute rate  not relative rate in a small mass window .    given our success in reproducing the wjj excess without any alterations to the shape or normalization of single - top ( as extracted from cdf data ) , it is not necessary to play with jet energy scale ( jes ) , etc .",
    "however , for completeness , we include a comparison of the shapes between the madevent @xmath16-channel shape and with what might be called the `` maximally distorted distribution '' ( mdd ) in fig.[fig : mdd ] . in the mdd",
    "we make the following modifications : multiply the jet energy scale ( jes ) by @xmath58 , multiply the missing energy scale by @xmath59 , lower the cut on @xmath60 to @xmath61 gev from 25  gev , and lower the cut to @xmath62 gev from 40  gev . the missing energy cut and energy shift",
    "are made because they are sensitive to slightly different physical effects .",
    "the change in the cut on @xmath10 is made because , as we pointed out in ref.@xcite this distribution is not all that well modeled by leading order .",
    "the conclusions are that shifts in jes , or misprediction on the shape of @xmath10 can both push the peak of the top backgrounds to slightly higher @xmath12 values ; and allowing uncertainty into the missing energy measurement can increase the normalization .",
    "neither is required , but does give some sense of the inherent uncertainties in the shapes and normalizations fit in the data .",
    "there are additional theoretical uncertainties on top of these , but they are a minor issue compared to understanding the origin of the significant deficit of @xmath17-channel production and excess in @xmath16-channel production in that 3.2 @xmath63 data set .    in conclusion , if a data - derived background estimation including single - top - quark production is used to measure @xmath0 we find that there is no evidence of any excess or deficit within the cdf data set .",
    "instead , a more interesting anomaly exists within cdf data : namely , there are too many @xmath1 and @xmath3 @xmath2-tag events , and too few @xmath4 @xmath2-tag events .",
    "hopefully , an understanding of the origin of this observation will explain the both the apparent @xmath0 and single - top - quark anomalies in the cdf data set .",
