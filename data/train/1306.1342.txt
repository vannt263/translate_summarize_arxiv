    "the fundamentals of quantum physics were discovered and formulated nearly a hundred years ago .",
    "three decades ago scientists postulated that the laws of quantum physics could be used to improve capabilities of computation and communication technologies @xcite .",
    "this idea sparked intense research resulting in the discovery of many quantum information protocols , some of them even with practical , modern implementations @xcite .",
    "one such application of quantum information is quantum cryptography , comprising various quantum key distribution protocols ( qkd ) @xcite .",
    "qkd offers unconditional security of private communications certified by the laws of quantum physics . in the real world",
    ", qkd suffers from various technological limits , especially the need to trust imperfect detectors and single photon sources , quantum channel losses , and background noise .",
    "the latter effects limit the maximum distance for unconditionally secure communications @xcite .",
    "long - distance qkd has been realized over 144 km in free - space @xcite and over 260 km in an optical fiber @xcite .",
    "trust in the imperfect devices used for cryptography allows eavesdroppers to attack unintended leakages of information or control detectors , known as side channels @xcite .",
    "the side channel attacks can be solved in principle by using bell - state projection measurements or using entanglement - based protocols .",
    "the simpler approach is measurement - device - independent qkd @xcite . in this case",
    "a projection on a bell state in the middle of the communication line removes all detector side channels are removed .",
    "the more complete approach is device - independent qkd ( di - qkd ) @xcite and its security is based on the loophole - free violation of a bell inequality .",
    "di - qkd removes all source and detector side channels but requires closing of the detector ( high - efficiency detection ) and locality ( distant detectors ) loopholes , which has not yet been achieved simultaneously @xcite .    for di - qkd and other protocols requiring high - efficiency detection ,",
    "a method is required to circumvent the channel losses inherent in photon transmission . in classical optical communication networks",
    "the problem of losses is solved using amplifiers of the classical signal . for quantum communication ,",
    "losses are more fundamental .",
    "the quantum signals are stored in polarization or temporal modes of individual photons and any quantum amplifier is bound by the quantum limits like the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "several proposals of quantum amplifiers were recently introduced , wherein the quantum limit can be circumvented by making the amplification non - deterministic . this type of amplification is called heralded noiseless amplification @xcite and is already seeing successful implementation @xcite . note that there exists a complete equivalence between distribution of two - qubit entanglement and secure key distribution @xcite . in other words , any quantum channel is capable of secret communication if and only if it is capable of distributing entanglement .    in this article",
    "we propose a new scheme of a linear - optical qubit amplifier that can restore the attenuated qubit and is also capable of distilling deteriorated entanglement of the qubit state .",
    "our amplifier is ready to be used in di - qkd schemes .",
    "moreover it outperforms previously published proposals .",
    "in contrast to gisin _",
    "et al . _",
    "scheme @xcite , the success probability of our device does not asymptotically approach zero when increasing the amplification gain . furthermore in comparison to pitkanen _ et al . _  scheme @xcite , our device provides tuneable gain and for the case of infinite gain allows better success probability due to its intrinsic elimination of the two - photon component after heralding .",
    "however , the pitkanen _",
    "_ device may perform better when using a probabilistic source for the ancilla photons , due to its extra stage of heralding .",
    "the scheme by curty and moroder makes use of entanglement as in our device , but it is limited to infinite gain only @xcite , and in this regime it performs comparably to our device .",
    "further to these works , we present a thorough investigation of the gain versus success probability tradeoff which is a crucial figure of merit for probabilistic amplifiers .",

    "are standard polarization analysis detection blocks ( for reference see @xcite ) . ]    the amplifier ( depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) consists of four polarizing beam splitters .",
    "two of them ( pbs@xmath2 and pbs@xmath3 ) form a mach - zehnder interferometer between signal input port `` in '' and output port `` out '' .",
    "these polarizing beam splitters totally transmit horizontally polarized light while totally reflect light with vertical polarization .",
    "the other two are partially - polarizing beam splitters , denoted as ppbs@xmath0 and ppbs@xmath1 , and placed in their respective arms of the interferometer .",
    "ppbs@xmath0 reflects vertically polarized light , while having reflectivity @xmath4 for horizontal polarization . in terms of creation operators",
    "this transformation reads @xmath5 where labelling of spatial modes has been adopted from fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] and h , v denote horizontal and vertical polarizations .",
    "similarly the ppbs@xmath1 reflects completely the horizontal polarization and with reflectivity @xmath4 it reflects vertically polarized photons .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is to be tuned as explained below .",
    "successful operation of the amplifier is heralded by two - photon coincidence detection on detection blocks d@xmath0 and d@xmath1 .    to demonstrate the principle of operation ,",
    "let us assume the input signal to be a coherent superposition of vacuum and a polarization - encoded single photon qubit @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes vacuum , @xmath8 , @xmath9 denote horizontal and vertical polarization states respectively and the coefficients meet the normalization condition @xmath10 .",
    "the amplifier makes also use of a pair of ancillary photons impinging on ports @xmath11 and @xmath12 of ppbs@xmath0 and ppbs@xmath1 respectively .",
    "these ancillary photons are initially in a maximally entangled bell state of the form @xmath13 where the indices denote the ancillary photons spatial modes .",
    "the total state entering the amplifier composed of the signal and ancillary photons reads @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we inspect evolution of all the individual terms present in previous equation .",
    "since the successful operation of the amplifier is conditioned by a two - photon coincidence detection by d@xmath0 & d@xmath1 we post - select only such cases : @xmath15 , it is impossible to have more than one photon in the output mode , even for multiple photons in the input mode",
    ". subsequently we perform polarization - sensitive detection on d@xmath0 and d@xmath1 in the basis of diagonal @xmath16 and anti - diagonal @xmath17 linear polarization .",
    "this way we erase the information about the ancillary state and project the signal at the output port to @xmath18 where we have incorporated the fact that only if both the detected polarizations on d@xmath0 and d@xmath1 are identical ( dd or aa coincidences ) the device heralds a successful amplification and thus only one half of the measurement outcomes contributes to success probability .    at this point",
    ", we define the amplification gain @xmath19 as a fraction between signal and vacuum probabilities @xmath20 and calculate the corresponding success probability @xmath21.\\ ] ] note that while the gain itself is input state independent , the success probability depends on both the gain and the input state parameters .",
    "this reflects the intuitive fact that it is for instance impossible to amplify a qubit that is actually not present in the input state ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "( color online ) success probability is depicted as a function of gain for three different input states parametrized by @xmath23 . for comparison , the success probability of gisin _ et al .",
    "_  scheme @xcite is presented ( in this case @xmath24 ) .",
    "note that the success probability of our amplifier converges asymptotically to a non - zero value for any state with @xmath25 .",
    "success probability is also plotted as a function of nominal gain @xmath26 for the case of @xmath27 .",
    "note that according to its definition ( [ eq : gain_nom ] ) , the nominal gain is upper bounded by the value of 20 in this particular case ( blue x symbol ) . ]",
    "let us analyse the results further . as expected the gain @xmath28",
    "is obtained for @xmath29 with success probability @xmath30 independent on the input state . on the other hand ,",
    "an infinite gain is obtained for @xmath31 with success probability of @xmath32 . in this particular case",
    ", it is however possible to increase the success probability twice by including also detection coincidences da and ad accompanied by a feed - forward operation @xmath33 on the output state .",
    "note that this regime is suitable for non - demolition presence detection of the qubit @xcite .",
    "[ fig : prob_gain ] depicts the trade - off between success probability and gain for three different input states containing different amounts of vacuum .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "its authors proposed also another measure of amplifier performance ",
    "the nominal gain @xmath26 defined as @xmath34 while the ordinary gain @xmath19 describes how much the qubit to vacuum intensity ratio has been increased under the amplification procedure , the nominal gain shows how much the overall success probability of finding the qubit state has increased .",
    "for this reason , the nominal gain is bound by the inverse value of the initial qubit probability ( e.g. for @xmath35 , the maximum value of nominal gain is 5 and in this case the vacuum state is completely eliminated ) .",
    "[ fig : prob_gain ] depicts the success probability as a function of nominal gain for one particular initial state ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in contrast to gisin _",
    "_  scheme @xcite , the success probability does not decrease asymptotically to 0 with increasing gain ( also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob_gain ] for comparison ) .",
    "one may however suggest that in the case of infinite gain , the scheme performs exactly as well as standard teleportation .",
    "while this is indeed true , standard teleportation does not allow to tune the amplification gain and therefore the superposition of vacuum and qubit state collapses either onto vacuum or qubit state .",
    "in contrast , our scheme allows for the coherent superposition of these two terms to be maintained . keeping coherence between vacuum and qubit terms is crucial for instance in all applications involving dual rail encoding .",
    "quantum entanglement is one of the key ingredients in quantum communications . it can be used for teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , or remote state preparation @xcite .",
    "it is also very sensitive to losses and decoherence occurring in the communication channel @xcite .",
    "for this reason , entanglement distillation  the way of improving entanglement of a state subjected to some degradation  is a very important tool in quantum communications @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we show how the amplifier can be used to distill entanglement on an example entangled state in dual - rail encoding .",
    "suppose an unknown polarization qubit @xmath37 is distributed in two spatial modes creating thus maximally entangled state of the form @xmath38 used to distribute the second spatial mode of this entangled state .",
    "this channel would deteriorate the state to @xmath39 where @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this state belongs to the class of amplitude damped states from ref .",
    "@xcite where the entanglement and nonlocality of such states was studied . since various measures of entanglement have different operational meaning , thus below we consider amplification of a few popular entanglement measures analyzed in @xcite ( for a review on entanglement measures see @xcite ) .",
    "the negativity ( concurrence ) of the mixed state before amplification is simply @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "after the amplification in the lossy mode the parameters of the state @xmath45 read @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath19 denotes the gain as defined in previous section and @xmath48 .",
    "the entanglement of @xmath45 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) can be quantified by its concurrence @xmath49 which can be further used to express its negativity as @xmath50\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\mathcal{n}}{2}[\\sqrt{(1-t)^2 + 4gt } - ( 1-t)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the third prominent measure of entanglement is the relative entropy of entanglement @xmath51 , but as demonstrated by miranowicz and ishizaka @xcite finding closed formula for @xmath51 in case of the amplitude - damped states requires solving a single variable equation for which no general analytic solution is known .",
    "hence , we calculate @xmath51 numerically as described in @xcite .    as shown on the example of negativity in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : opt_gain ] suggests that for any value of @xmath58 , there is an optimal gain @xmath59 regardless of the applied entanglement measure .",
    "the entanglement measures before and after optimal amplification are depicted in fig .",

    "note that for gain reaching infinity ( standard teleportation ) , the entangled state would collapse onto the qubit state thus destroying the entanglement .",

    "[ fig : ent_ampl ] we plot the amplified negativity as a function of the chosen gain for several different values of channel transmissivity .",

    "the above performed calculations reveal how qubit amplification can be used for partial entanglement recovery .",

    "experimentally demonstrated a rather clever way to eliminate the presence of such term @xcite .",
    "they considered only vacuum and a fixed polarization single photon state , but the technique can be adopted for qubit amplification as well .",
    "their approach is based on deliberate coherent attenuation before the state is transmitted via the lossy channel .",
    "this coherent attenuation is performed by subjecting the state to a beam splitter with transmissivity @xmath67 and subsequent post - selection on vacuum in the ancillary mode . with the probability of @xmath67",
    ", one can thus disbalance the original state ( [ eq : entangled ] ) to @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "the choice of attenuation factor @xmath67 influences the probability @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the density matrix @xmath45 of the state @xmath72 transmitted through the lossy channel",
    ". subsequent amplification will increase @xmath73 thus also the entanglement of the state .",
    "ideally for @xmath74 and gain @xmath75 the original negativity can be completely restored . of",
    "course such parameters lead to zero success rate so there is a need for some sort of compromise .",
    "nevertheless this line of reasoning demonstrates the importance of amplification with high gain , where our amplifier outperforms the original gisin _",
    "et al . _  proposal @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned compromise can be quantified using the entangling efficiency @xmath76 of the protocol @xcite .",
    "the entangling efficiency is an entanglement generation measure suitable for probabilistic devices .",
    "in contrast to a more widely used entangling power @xcite , the entangling efficiency optimizes over the device parameters in order to maximize the product of success probability and negativity ( or any other entanglement measure ) @xmath77     ( color online ) negativity and success probability trade - off obtained using coherent attenuation before transferring the state through a lossy channel . this trade - off",
    "is depicted for three different values of channel transmissivity @xmath52 . even though this strategy allows to increase the negativity arbitrarily close to @xmath78 , the product of negativity and success probability",
    "is maximized when no coherent attenuation is used . ]",
    "the negativity is calculated similarly as presented above using the analytical form of the density matrix .",
    "the success probability is composed of the success probability of attenuation ( @xmath67 ) and the success probability of amplification ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : psucc ] ) ) . in order to find the best strategy ,",
    "we perform a numerical simulation .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob_neg ] shows the trade - off between negativity and success probability obtained when using the coherent attenuation strategy .",
    "this simulation also reveals that the product of success probability and negativity is maximized for @xmath79 in all cases .",
    "so as far as the `` entanglement rate '' described by the entangling efficiency is concerned , the coherent attenuation does not offer any improvement . on the other hand , it is important to note that this strategy finds its merit when the goal is to achieve high negativity or high fidelity at the output .",
    "photon amplifiers can find additional applications in device - independent quantum key distribution , a stronger form of entanglement - based quantum cryptography based on the violation of bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , di - qkd does not require any knowledge of alice and bob s measurement devices , but does require closing the detection loophole @xcite .",
    "a number of ways of closing this loophole have been demonstrated , including using trapped ions @xcite and efficient photon detection @xcite , but none has done so over the long distances needed for cryptography due to the intrinsic loss associated with photon transmission in fiber or free space .",

    "one photon is sent to alice , which she detects directly with high efficiency , and the other photon is sent over a long channel to bob .",
    "bob routes the incoming photon through some heralded amplifier ( e.g. the one proposed by gisin _",
    "or by us ) before detection , closing the detection loophole by performing a bell measurement only upon successful amplification .    in order to compare the performance of the three previous amplifiers with ours , we performed numerical quantum optical simulations of the amplifiers .",
    "the initial source of entanglement was spontaneous - parametric down - conversion , with photon pair probability set to @xmath80 , and both amplifiers used on - demand photon sources ( two single photons for the gisin _",

    ", we used bucket detectors with 95  % detection efficiency and 91  % coupling efficiency as heralding detectors , and untrusted noiseless photon - number resolving detectors with the same efficiency for the detection of the photons for the bell test after heralding .",
    "the former are modelled on fast superconducting nanowire detectors @xcite and the latter transition edge sensors @xcite .",
    "we optimized all amplifiers over their tunable beam splitter reflectivity at each point .",
    "finally we calculated the secure key rate per laser pulse from eq .",

    "it additionally outperforms the pitkanen _",
    "_ scheme by a nearly constant factor , where this factor comes from improvements in success probability and the ratio of conclusive to inconclusive events after heralding .",
    "this is possible because in the pitkanen _",
    "_ scheme , the elimination of the unwanted two - photon component even for ideal ancilla photons after heralding comes at the cost of vanishing success probability , a tradeoff our amplifier does not suffer from .",
    "the optimal key rate in this di - qkd scenario for our amplifier occurs with @xmath31 for all values of channel loss , such that it performs identically to the curty and moroder proposal  @xcite .",

    "secondly , for device - independent quantum key distribution we have presented the significant improvement made by this amplifier over the previously proposed devices , including a key rate more than three orders of magnitude better for 100  km transmission distance .",
