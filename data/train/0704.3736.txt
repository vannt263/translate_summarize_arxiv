    "in the light of the results obtained from the analysis of several recent high - precision data sets , a wide consensus was reached in the cosmology community on a concordance model for a flat @xmath2 universe with a primordial phase of inflation__. _ _ in this framework , the universe is flat and filled in with cold dark matter ( cdm ) and dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant ( @xmath3 ) , in addition to the standard baryonic and electromagnetic components .",
    "the cosmological principle assumption states that the universe is globally homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the large scale structure and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation find their origin in gaussian quantum energy density fluctuations developed around the homogeneous and isotropic background , as predicted by the standard inflationary scenario taking place in the primordial universe .",
    "the cmb data , and specifically the data provided by the nasa wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite experiment , have played a leading role in defining this concordance model @xcite .",
    "however anomalies have been reported .",
    "they naturally question the basic hypotheses on which the model relies , in particular the gaussianity ( assumed by the standard inflationary scenario ) and statistical isotropy ( postulated by the cosmological principle ) of the statistical distribution from which the cmb temperature fluctuations arise in the primordial universe .",
    "departures from gaussianity of the one - year and three - year wmap data have been reported in terms of various statistics .",
    "firstly , non - gaussianity was notably detected through the use of a genus - based statistic @xcite .",
    "secondly , wavelet analyses have also reported non - gaussian deviations .",
    "an excess in the kurtosis of the wavelet coefficients of the axisymmetric mexican hat wavelet on the sphere was found at wavelet scales corresponding to angular sizes on the celestial sphere around @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this deviation is located in the southern galactic hemisphere , where a very cold spot was identified at @xmath5 , with @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 respectively standing for the co - latitude and longitude in galactic spherical coordinates .",
    "this detection was confirmed with various wavelets and various statistics @xcite .",
    "notice that the cold spot identified not only bears non - gaussianity , but also represents a departure from statistical isotropy , in terms of a north - south asymmetry in galactic coordinates .",
    "departures from statistical isotropy of the one - year and three - year wmap data have also been reported in terms of various statistics .",
    "firstly , a north - south asymmetry in ecliptic coordinates has been detected through the use of n - point correlation functions @xcite , minkowski functionals @xcite , local power spectra @xcite , local bispectra @xcite , and local curvature @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry is maximum in a coordinate system with the north pole lying at @xmath8 , close to the northern end of the ecliptic poles axis at @xmath9 .",
    "this north - south asymmetry was confirmed through the application of a pair angular - separation histogram method @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was again observed through the search for a best - fit dipolar modulation of the three - year wmap data @xcite .",
    "the corresponding dipolar axis has a northern end at @xmath10 .",
    "secondly , an anomalous alignment of the lowest multipoles of the wmap data was reported , especially at @xmath11 @xcite , but also up to @xmath12 @xcite , and for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this alignment highlights the so - called axis of evil , with northern end at @xmath14 , very close to the cmb dipole axis , with northern end at @xmath15 .",
    "very recently , a new statistic to analyze the alignment of multipoles that is robust against treatments of the galactic plane was proposed @xcite .",
    "the corresponding analysis highlights a weaker detection for these alignments .",
    "the large scale fluctuations of the cmb were also pointed out to fit with the expected pattern of an anisotropic bianchi vii@xmath16 universe @xcite , although the cosmological parameters derived from this hypothesis are ruled - out @xcite . notice on the contrary that bipolar power spectra analyses are consistent with no violation of the statistical isotropy of the universe @xcite",
    "finally , in a previous work , we detected a very significant deviation from statistical isotropy of the one - year wmap data through the use of a novel alignment analysis , based on the decomposition of the wmap data with steerable wavelets on the sphere @xcite . this alignment analysis probes the anomalous alignment of local cmb features toward specific directions on the celestial sphere . at wavelet scales corresponding to angular sizes around @xmath0 , an anomalous alignment",
    "is observed toward a mean preferred plane in the sky , whose normal axis , with a northern end at @xmath17 , is close to the cmb dipole axis and close to the axis of evil .",
    "in addition , a prominent cluster of directions toward which local features are aligned identifies a mean preferred axis in this plane , with a northern end at @xmath18 , very close to the ecliptic poles axis .",
    "the detection of this alignment anomaly actually synthesized the previously reported statistical anisotropy results by highlighting both the ecliptic poles axis and the cmb dipole axis as preferred axes in the sky .",
    "but further analyses were still required to establish their origin .",
    "the aim of this paper is to probe further the statistical isotropy of the cmb through two different analyses .",
    "firstly , we reproduce , on the three - year wmap data , the previously discussed alignment analysis of the local cmb features originally performed on the one - year wmap data . secondly , we propose a signed - intensity analysis of the local cmb features , based on the same steerable wavelet decomposition of the three - year wmap data",
    ". this _ _ _ _ signed - intensity analysis probes the anomalously high or low temperature of local cmb features . the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : methodology ] , we discuss the overall methodologies defined for the subsequent analyses . in section",
    "[ sec : analyses ] , we present the results of analysis of the three - year wmap data . in section [ sec : questfororigin ] , we investigate possible origins for the anomalies observed .",
    "we finally conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we firstly recall the notion of wavelet steerability and present the particular steerable wavelet on the sphere used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "secondly , we discuss how to differentiate between statistical anisotropy and non - gaussianity detections through the analysis of the cmb data with simulations produced following the concordance model .",
    "we finally recall the procedure for the alignment analysis , and define the new procedure for the signed - intensity analysis , both intended to probe the statistical isotropy of the cmb data .      a practical approach to the formalism of continuous wavelets on the sphere ( _ i.e. _ the unit sphere @xmath19 ) , and the corresponding notion of steerable wavelets",
    "were recently introduced @xcite .",
    "let us primarily fix some notations .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional cartesian coordinate system @xmath20 centered on the sphere , and where the direction @xmath21 identifies the north pole .",
    "any point @xmath22 on the sphere is identified by its corresponding spherical coordinates @xmath23 , where @xmath6 $ ] stands for the co - latitude , and @xmath7 for the longitude .",
    "any filter invariant under rotation around itself is said to be axisymmetric . by definition ,",
    "any non - axisymmetric , or directional , filter is steerable if a rotation by @xmath24 around itself may be expressed in terms of a finite linear combination of non - rotated basis filters . in this work ,",
    "we consider the second gaussian derivative wavelet ( 2gd ) , @xmath25 , which is obtained by a stereographic projection of the second derivative in direction @xmath26 of a gaussian in the tangent plane at the north pole .",
    "the filter obtained is a steerable wavelet on the sphere which may be rotated in terms of three basis filters : the second derivative in the direction @xmath26 itself , @xmath25 , the second derivative in the direction @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and the cross - derivative , @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "these basis filters dilated at any scale @xmath30 read :    @xmath31\\label{eq:2gdbasis1}\\\\ \\psi_{a}^{\\partial_{\\hat{y}}^{2}(gau)}\\left(\\theta,\\varphi\\right ) & = & f_{a}\\left(\\theta\\right)\\left[1-\\frac{4}{a^{2}}\\tan^{2}\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\sin^{2}\\varphi\\right]\\label{eq:2gdbasis2}\\\\ \\psi_{a}^{\\partial_{\\hat{x}}\\partial_{\\hat{y}}(gau)}\\left(\\theta,\\varphi\\right ) & = & f_{a}\\left(\\theta\\right)\\left[-\\frac{2}{a^{2}}\\tan^{2}\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\sin2\\varphi\\right],\\label{eq:2gdbasis3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 .",
    "the value of the scale @xmath33 identifies with the dispersion of the gaussian in units of @xmath34 .",
    "the angular size of the 2gd is defined as twice the half - width of the wavelet , where the half - width is defined by @xmath35 , which is closely approximated by @xmath33 at small scales .",
    "the analysis of a signal @xmath36 with a given wavelet @xmath37 simply defines a set of wavelet coefficients @xmath38 , which result from the directional correlation between @xmath36 and the wavelet dilated at any scale @xmath33 , @xmath39 . in other words",
    "these wavelet coefficients are defined by the scalar product between the signal and the wavelet dilated at scale @xmath33 , rotated around itself by @xmath40 , and translated at any point @xmath41 on the sphere , also denoted @xmath42 : @xmath43 the @xmath44 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the wavelet coefficients of a signal therefore characterize the signal at each scale @xmath33 , orientation @xmath40 , and position @xmath41 . by linearity of the operation defining wavelet coefficients from the wavelet , the relation of steerability of the wavelet is automatically transferred to the wavelet coefficients .",
    "the specific steerability relation for the wavelet coefficients of a signal @xmath36 with the 2gd reads:@xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the wavelet coefficients respectively obtained from the standard correlation ( _ i.e. _ @xmath49 ) of the signal with @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    at each scale @xmath33 and at each position @xmath41 ,",
    "one is typically interested in one or a few of the infinite number of wavelet coefficients associated with the infinite number of orientations @xmath40 @xcite . selecting",
    "the orientation @xmath53 that maximizes the absolute value of the wavelet coefficient , corresponds to selecting the local orientation at which the wavelet best matches the local feature of the signal .",
    "notice that , as the 2gd is invariant under rotation around itself by @xmath54 , orientations may arbitrarily be constrained in a range of length @xmath54 .",
    "as @xmath50 oscillates in the tangent direction @xmath26 , it actually detects features aligned along the tangent direction @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the local orientation of the feature itself , @xmath55 , is defined in terms of @xmath56 as : @xmath57 for the particular case of the 2gd , the steerability relation ( [ eq : steerability ] ) enables to compute the orientation @xmath58 from the wavelet coefficients obtained from the basis filters as : @xmath59 the wavelet coefficient itself at scale @xmath33 , position @xmath41 , and in direction @xmath58 , defines to so - called signed - intensity of the local feature:@xmath60    analyzing signals with steerable wavelets is interesting in several respects .",
    "firstly , the wavelet decomposition enables one to identify the scales @xmath33 of the physical processes which define the local feature of the signal at each point @xmath41 .",
    "secondly , the steerability theoretically gives access to the orientation and signed - intensity of these local features .",
    "finally , from the computational point of view , the calculation of a directional correlation at each analysis scale is an extremely demanding task .",
    "the relation of steerability is essential to reduce the complexity of calculation of the wavelet coefficients when local orientations are considered @xcite .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , under the cosmological principle assumption and in the framework of the standard inflationary scenario , the cmb signal can be interpreted as a realization of a gaussian and statistically isotropic random field .",
    "it is not a trivial task to develop an analysis procedure for testing statistical properties with only one realization ( because there is only one universe ) of the cmb signal . typically , the data are contaminated by noise and foreground emissions .",
    "simulations accounting for these peculiarities must be performed to test the compatibility of the data with a given set of assumptions .",
    "there are infinite ways of simulating departures from gaussianity or statistical isotropy .",
    "but unless one is interested in the compatibility of the data with a specific alternative model ( considering for example a non - standard inflationary scenario , an anisotropic universe , a non - trivial topology of the universe , topological defects , etc . )",
    ", simulations are produced following the concordance model . in that context ,",
    "any statistical incompatibility of the data with the simulations is to be interpreted as a departure from the whole assumption of gaussianity and statistical isotropy . despite that , postulating gaussianity allows one to interpret a detection as a departure from statistical isotropy , and conversely .",
    "typically , analyses using local estimators on the sphere , for example local power spectra , can naturally identify preferred directions and probe statistical isotropy , provided that gaussianity is postulated . on the contrary",
    ", analyses using global estimators on the sphere , for example statistical moments computed by averages on the whole sphere , explicitly assume statistical isotropy in order to probe gaussianity .    in this paper ,",
    "two analysis procedures are considered .",
    "the alignment analysis is recalled , which probes the anomalous alignment of local cmb features toward specific directions .",
    "a _ _ _ _ new signed - intensity analysis is also defined , which probes the anomalously high or low temperature of local cmb features .",
    "because of the local nature of the corresponding anomalies on the celestial sphere , we use these analyses as specific probes of the statistical isotropy of the cmb , while its gaussianity is postulated .",
    "the alignment of local cmb features toward specific directions on the celestial sphere can be probed with steerable wavelets by combining at each analysis scale @xmath33 and at each point @xmath41 the information on the orientation @xmath61 and on the signed - intensity @xmath62 ( the superscript @xmath63 identifies the cmb temperature field ) @xcite .",
    "firstly , the great circle is defined which passes by the point @xmath41 and admits as a tangent the local direction defined by @xmath61 .",
    "all directions on that great circle are considered to be seen by the local feature at @xmath41 with a weight naturally given as the absolute value of the signed - intensity @xmath64 at that point . at scale @xmath33 and in an arbitrary direction @xmath22 , the total weight @xmath65 is defined as the sum of the @xmath66 weights originating from all pixels @xmath67 in the original cmb signal , with @xmath68 , for which the great circle defined crosses the direction considered : @xmath69 the factor @xmath70 simply stands for the normalization of the total weights .",
    "it takes into account the total number of pixels on the sphere @xmath71 and the mean number @xmath72 of pixels on each great circle in the pixelization considered",
    ". it also accounts for the presence of an exclusion mask @xmath73 containing the pixels to be excluded from the analysis at each scale @xmath33 . as discussed in the next section ,",
    "our analyses are performed on healpix pixelizations @xcite . in this scheme , at a given resolution @xmath74 , the number of pixels on each great circle is constant and reads @xmath75 .",
    "these total weights constitute a new signal on the celestial sphere .",
    "notice that the procedure obviously assigns identical total weights to opposite directions , as any great circle on the sphere always contains a direction and its opposite direction on the same axis .",
    "in other words , the total weights signal is even under parity in the three - dimensional    cartesian coordinate system @xmath20 centered on the sphere .",
    "the analysis of this signal can be restricted to the directions @xmath22 in one arbitrary hemisphere of reference .",
    "in that hemisphere , the biggest total weights identify the directions toward which the cmb features are predominantly aligned , while the lowest total weights identify the directions predominantly avoided by the cmb features .",
    "an illustration of the procedure described is given in figure [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "alignment analysis procedure : example of signed - intensity distribution on the celestial sphere . at each point",

    "we have analyzed the three - year wmap data after correction for foreground emissions contamination by a template fitting technique @xcite .",
    "this procedure provides eight cleaned maps at various frequencies for the corresponding wmap radiometers : q1 and q2 at @xmath94 ghz , v1 and v2 at @xmath95 ghz , and w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 at @xmath96 ghz .",
    "these maps are available from the nasa lambda archive .",

    "it is assumed that the cmb is convolved with an instrumental beam that is well described by an isotropic window function and that the instrumental noise is to first order gaussian , statistically anisotropic , and uncorrelated .",
    "maps with better signal - to - noise ratio can be obtained , by an optimal combination of the eight cleaned maps obtained after foreground emissions removal and masking . at each pixel , this combination is obtained by weighting each map by the corresponding inverse noise variance to produce the so - called three - year wmap co - added cmb map @xcite , denoted here the wcm123 map . for the sake of the analysis , this map is considered to contain only cmb and instrumental noise .",
    "the residual foreground emissions are considered to be negligible .",
    "in addition to the wcm123 map , other maps are produced for different analysis purposes .",
    "three maps are built to optimize signal - to - noise ratio at each frequency by combining the foreground cleaned and masked maps of the corresponding radiometers : the wcm - q , wcm - v , and wcm - w .",
    "these frequency maps obviously contain cmb and instrumental noise , as well as residual foreground emissions which are precisely not neglected by principle .",
    "they are actually used to test whether detected anomalies are due to residual foreground emissions , which are frequency - dependent .",
    "three other maps are also produced to remove in depth both cmb and residual foreground emissions at each frequency by subtracting the foreground cleaned and masked maps of the corresponding radiometers : q1 - q2 defines the wcm - nq map , v1 - v2 defines the wcm - nv maps , and w1 - w2 + w3 - w4 defines the wcm - nw map . despite negligible cmb and foreground emissions residuals at small angular sizes ( well below @xmath99 ) due to the different beam window functions of the radiometers at each frequency ,",
    "these difference maps essentially contain instrumental noise .",
    "they are used to test whether detected anomalies are due to any effect associated with instrumental noise .",
    "a last map is produced to remove in depth only cmb by subtracting the foreground cleaned and masked maps at different frequencies , defining the wcm - nwvq map as w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 -v1 - v2 - q1 - q2 . despite negligible cmb residuals at small angular sizes ( well below @xmath99 )",

    "it can be used as an additional test of the impact of instrumental noise and residual foreground emissions on detected anomalies .    in order to minimize any contamination coming from errors on the cosmological dipole subtraction ,",
    "the dipole outside the mask is removed from each analyzed map @xcite .",
    "all these maps are initially produced in healpix pixelization at the resolution @xmath100 , corresponding to maps with several million equal - area pixels with a spatial resolution of @xmath101 .",

    "each of the simulations used to compare the results of the analysis of the data to what is expected from the concordance model was produced as follows .",
    "the spherical harmonics coefficients of a gaussian and statistically isotropic cmb realization are obtained from the angular power spectrum determined by the cosmological parameters of the three - year wmap best - fit model @xcite with camb ( code for anistropies in the microwave background ) .",
    "the observation at each of the eight wmap radiometers considered is simulated by convolving that signal in harmonic space with the corresponding isotropic window function .",
    "each map is then transformed to pixel space at the resolution @xmath100 , and a gaussian and statistically anisotropic noise realization is added with the proper dispersion per pixel .",
    "this provides simulations of the cmb signal , as seen by the radiometers at the different wmap frequencies considered .",
    "the same prescriptions as those described above for the data are then applied to produce one simulated coadded map ( wcm123 ) , three simulated frequency maps ( wcm - q , wcm - v , and wcm - w ) , and three simulated difference maps ( wcm - nq , wcm - nv , wcm - nw , and wcm - nwvq ) .",
    "these simulations are then also downgraded at the resolution @xmath104 for our analysis .",
    "ten thousand simulations of the wcm123 map were produced for the main analysis . in order to reduce the corresponding computation time ,",
    "only one thousand simulations were considered for the frequency maps and difference maps used to analyze the origin of a possible detection in terms of instrumental noise or foreground emissions .",
    "this is by far enough since no precise significance level is established from the analysis of these maps .",
    "only the general patterns of possible detections are studied in comparison with the patterns observed from the analysis of the wcm123 map .",
    "finally , in valid pixels close to masked regions , the result of the directional correlation of a signal with steerable wavelets at a given scale of analysis is inevitably affected by the zero values of the kp0 mask . on each of the maps presented above , and obviously both for the data and simulations , an exclusion mask @xmath73 is therefore defined at each wavelet scale @xmath33 in order to exclude the affected pixels from the analysis @xcite .",

    "the global significance level of detection is @xmath159 .",
    "let us also emphasize the peculiar distribution on the celestial sphere of the three spots detected , which are roughly separated two by two by right angles .",
    "they identify the three basis vectors of a coordinate frame with the north pole close to the southern end of the ecliptic poles axis .",
    "the hot spot coincides with the north pole , and the cold spots roughly lie in the perpendicular plane , with one of them very close to the southern end of the cmb dipole axis .",
    "an all - scale significance level may be computed , which should account for the fact that twelve wavelet scales have been probed , hence artificially increasing chances of detection at one or another scale .",
    "but it should also account for all the detections observed in both the alignment and the signed - intensity analyses . in the data , the two alignment detections at",
    "the wavelet scales @xmath125 and @xmath137 , and the four signed - intensity detections at the wavelet scales @xmath125 , @xmath137 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 are observed at global significance levels roughly lower than @xmath160 . in a conservative approach , the all - scale significance level defined is estimated as the percentage of simulations with a global significance level lower or equal to @xmath160 for at least two consecutive scales in the alignment analysis , and at least four consecutive scales ( not necessarily related with the first two ) in the signed - intensity analysis .",
    "the corresponding value for this robust all - scale significance level is @xmath161 .",
    "this actually confirms the best levels of detections observed in the data in terms of global significance levels at individual wavelet scales in each of the two analyses .",
    "in this section , we firstly establish that the alignment and signed - intensity anomalies detected are only very partially related .",
    "secondly , we consider and discard possible origins of these anomalies in terms of instrumental noise , foreground emissions , and some form of unknown systematics .      the alignment and signed - intensity anomalies both highlight the ecliptic poles axis and the cmb dipole axis as preferred axes in the sky .",
    "moreover , in terms of procedure , the alignment analysis based on the definition ( [ eq : total - weights ] ) of total weights can be interpreted as a variation of the signed - intensity analysis , taking into account the orientation of local cmb features .",
    "consequently , it is natural to raise the question of a possible relation between the corresponding anomalies detected .",
    "more precisely , one can verify if the part of the alignment anomaly associated with positive total weights originates , at least partially , in the signed - intensity anomaly . in order to probe this hypothesis ,",
    "the alignment analysis was repeated on the wcm123 map , in which each of the three spots responsible for the signed - intensity anomaly was in turn excluded from the analysis__. _ _ in that regard , the pixels corresponding to the spot considered were simply included in the exclusion mask .    when the hot spot close to the ecliptic poles axis is excluded , the number of directions anomalous at @xmath90 associated with positive total weights drops , in one hemisphere of reference , from @xmath130 to @xmath135 at wavelet scale @xmath125 , and the corresponding global significance level increases from @xmath162 to @xmath163 . at wavelet scale @xmath137 , the number of directions anomalous at @xmath90 associated with positive total weights drops , again in one hemisphere of reference , from @xmath140 to @xmath164 , and the corresponding global significance level increases more drastically from @xmath165 to @xmath166 . on the contrary",
    ", there is no significant impact on the alignment anomaly of neither of the two cold spots responsible for the signed - intensity anomaly . in other words ,",
    "the hot spot of anomalous signed - intensities is partially , but certainly not totally , responsible for the part of the alignment anomaly associated with positive total weights , while the two cold spots have no significant impact on it .",
    "the observed alignment anomaly associated with positive total weights ( see figure [ fig : perr03tw ] ) is therefore not due to the alignment of a small number of local cmb features with an anomalous signed - intensity .",
    "it is rather due to the alignment of a large number of local cmb features with a non - anomalous signed - intensity .",
    "this result is in agreement with a previous analysis showing that the local cmb features aligned toward the directions exhibiting anomalous positive total weights are essentially homogeneously distributed on the celestial sphere @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "the alignment anomaly observed originates only very partially in the signed - intensity anomaly .      before claiming a possible cosmological origin of the detections reported , it is essential to look for possible origins in terms of instrumental noise or foreground emissions .",
    "a possible origin in terms of instrumental noise in the wcm123 map is analyzed by reproducing the analyses on the difference maps wcm - nq , wcm - nv , and wcm - nw , which are essentially noise maps ( see subsection [ sub : datasimul ] ) .",
    "in particular , it is known that the wmap data present a small component of correlated noise at large angular sizes ( well above @xmath99 ) , which is not taken into account in our simulations .",
    "this instrumental noise might be detected through the analysis of these difference maps .",
    "moreover , the pattern of this correlated noise is related to the ecliptic coordinates system through the wmap scanning strategy .",
    "it is therefore a plausible origin of the alignment and signed - intensity anomalies observed .",
    "the corresponding maps representing the cumulative probabilities that the simulations exhibit a lower value than the data are presented in figure [ fig : noise ] , both for the total weights @xmath124 and signed - intensities @xmath143 at wavelet scale @xmath125 .",
    "the total weights and signed - intensities patterns revealed do not correspond to those obtained from the wcm123 map on which the anomalies are observed .",
    "instrumental noise can therefore be discarded as a possible origin of the alignment and signed - intensity detections .",
    "a possible origin in terms of residual foreground emissions in the wcm123 map is analyzed by reproducing the analyses on the frequency maps wcm - q , wcm - v , and wcm - w , which contain essentially cmb , with instrumental noise and residual foreground emissions ( see subsection [ sub : datasimul ] ) .",
    "the analyses are also reproduced on the difference map wcm - nwvq which essentially contains instrumental noise and residual foreground emissions ( see subsection [ sub : datasimul ] ) .",
    "the corresponding maps representing the cumulative probabilities that the simulations exhibit a lower value than the data are presented in figure [ fig : fore ] , both for the total weights @xmath124 and signed - intensities @xmath143 at wavelet scale @xmath125 .",
    "the total weights and signed - intensities patterns obtained from the wcm - q , wcm - v , and wcm - w maps are similar to those obtained from the wcm123 map on which the anomaly is observed .",
    "consequently , the detection is independent of the frequency . as foreground emissions themselves",
    "are frequency - dependent , they may be discarded as a possible origin of the alignment and signed - intensity detections reported above .",
    "moreover , the total weights and signed - intensities patterns obtained from the wcm - nwvq maps do not correspond to those obtained from the wcm123 map .",
    "this is an additional evidence that instrumental noise and foreground emissions can be discarded as possible origins of the alignment and signed - intensity detections .              in the absence of instrumental noise or foreground emissions explanations",
    ", the fact that the ecliptic poles axis and the cmb dipole axis are strongly highlighted through our detections as preferred axes in the sky still suggests the possible presence of unknown systematics , more than a cosmological origin of the detections .",
    "these directions are indeed local concepts with _ a priori _ no global cosmological meaning",
    ".    the wavelet analysis allowed us to identify the scales , roughly around @xmath4 of angular size , at which the anomalies are observed .",
    "this represents an important complementary piece of information in the search for their origin .",
    "let us recall in that respect that the size of the mesh of the wmap scanning pattern defined by the combination of the spin and precession of the satellite is of the order of several degrees @xcite .",
    "moreover , the wmap scanning strategy is also obviously connected to the ecliptic coordinates system .",
    "unknown systematics related to the wmap scanning strategy are therefore a plausible source of the detected anomaly .    in that vein , it was recently suggested that north - south asymmetries can in principle be explained by a bad calibration of the cmb dipole @xcite . more generally it was also suggested that a modulation @xmath167 $ ] of the cmb temperature field @xmath168 with a modulation function @xmath169 , potentially coming from systematic effects , could in turn explain north - south asymmetries and low multipoles alignment @xcite",

    "they are therefore also adequate for correction of the wcm123 map . ] .",
    "firstly , the results induced by the dipolar correction are as follows .",
    "the alignment anomaly is preserved at the wavelet scales @xmath125 and @xmath137 .",

    "the axis of the dipolar modulation has its southern end at @xmath173 , close to the cold spot centered at @xmath146 .",
    "the correction consequently reduces the number of anomalous pixels which define that spot , thereby reducing its impact on the anomaly @xcite .",
    "the other two spots are essentially left unchanged as they lie in the perpendicular plane , where the dipolar modulation is negligible .",
    "the global significance level of detection is increased at all scales . typically , at the main wavelet scale of detection @xmath125 , the global significance level rises from @xmath144 to @xmath174 .",

    "the correction pattern is such that it still reduces the number of anomalous pixels which define the cold spot centered at @xmath146 , while enhancing the number of pixels defining the hot spot .",
    "the second cold spot is essentially left unchanged .",
    "the global significance level of detection is not significantly modified at none of the scales .    consequently",
    ", the modulations considered clearly fail to explain the alignment and signed - intensity anomalies .",
    "moreover the impact of the correction is extremely sensitive to the arbitrary choice of the dipolar or dipolar - quadrupolar nature of the modulation .",
    "the existence of such a modulation , and its precise pattern , still need to be physically verified in terms of specific systematic effects before full credit may be given to the modifications induced .    in conclusion , neither instrumental noise nor foreground emissions seem to explain the alignment and signed - intensity anomalies reported . and first attempts to consider unknown systematics , potentially related to the wmap scanning strategy , also failed to explain our detections .",
    "consequently , a cosmological origin imprinted in the cmb can actually not be discarded . in that regard , as already emphasized @xcite , let us notice that the average wavelet scale at which our detections are made , around @xmath0 of angular size on the celestial sphere , is compatible with the size of primary cmb anisotropies due to topological defects such as texture fields @xcite or secondary anisotropies due to the rees - sciama effect @xcite .",
