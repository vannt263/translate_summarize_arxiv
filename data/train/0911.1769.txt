    "in matrix model proposals for type iib superstring theory and m - theory @xcite , describing gravity by matrices is one of the important subjects .",
    "gravity is not prepared at formulations of these matrix models , but it must be encoded in their matrix degrees of freedom .",
    "several years ago , a new interpretation of large @xmath0 matrix was proposed by hanada , kawai and kimura @xcite ; large @xmath0 matrices can describe covariant derivatives in curved space .",
    "they applied this new interpretation ( we call this interpretation  hkk interpretation \" or simply  hkk \" for later convenience ) to the ikkt matrix model @xcite , and derived the einstein equation in empty space from the classical matrix equation of motion .",
    "several studies have been done to explore this attractive proposal @xcite .    in the hkk interpretation ,",
    "large @xmath0 matrices contain not only vielbein and spin connection but also infinitely many other degrees of freedom with various higher spins .",
    "if one consider gravity derived by hkk without these higher spin fields , this is regarded as an effective theory in nearly empty space . even under such simplification , however , this effective theory has more degrees of freedom than einstein gravity . in hkk ,",
    "the vielbein and the spin connection encoded in large @xmath0 matrices are independent variables , then the matrix description of gravity gives rise to torsion degrees of freedom unless we impose some torsion free conditions by hand .",
    "therefore ikkt matrix model provides a torsion gravity .",
    "this arouses our curiosity on the role of torsion in the gravity from the matrix model .",
    "the classical field equation would be a good way to capture its semi - classical dynamics .",
    "gravity equations with torsion from several bosonic ikkt - type matrix models have been written down in @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to investigate classical solutions of the gravity equation with torsion , from the bosonic ikkt model , under simple settings of torsion .",
    "+ there are two remarks :    * a generalization of einstein gravity to including torsion has been known as the poincar gauge theory of gravity ( pgt ) , and has been studied extensively ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "it is described by a gravity lagrangian which includes bi - linear terms of torsion .",
    "vierbein and spin connection in this lagrangian are independent variables . on the other hand ,",
    "in this paper we will study a gravity equation with torsion which is derived from the hkk interpretation of a matrix model equation of motion , which is different from what is derived from the pgt .",
    "although the matrix equation of motion is derived from a matrix model action , the gravity equation of hkk seems difficult to derive by a variation of any gravitational lagrangian . * in @xcite , parts of torsion degrees of freedom were identified with scalar and 2nd rank antisymmetric tensor fields , which are analogous to the massless fields of string theory . in this paper",
    "we do not always follow such an interpretation but rather keep broader possibility for solutions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we briefly describe the gravity equation with torsion from the hkk interpretation and fix our notation .",
    "the original proposal was done for a matrix model with an euclidean signature . after writing down the field equation with euclidean signature ,",
    "we rotate it to one with a lorentzian signature . in section 3 , we consider time dependent solutions under homogeneous - isotropic ansatz . in section 4 ,",
    "static and spherical symmetric solutions are studied .",
    "in addition to the analytic method , we examine numerical computation to find solutions .",
    "finally we summarize and discuss our results in section 5 .",
    "large @xmath0 matrices can describe covariant derivatives in curved spaces @xcite . in this interpretation ,",
    "the large @xmath0 matrices are regarded as a map between sections of a fiber bundle over a curved manifold whose fiber is the vector space of structure group @xmath3 .",
    "formally differential operators may be expanded by a power series of covariant derivatives and lorentz generators . associated with this expansion , various fields : @xmath4 gauge field , vielbein , spin connection and other infinitely many higher spin fields appear . here",
    "we concentrate ourselves on the degrees of freedom associated with the vielbein and spin connection .",
    "in this situation the hkk interpretation is simply stated as @xmath5 where index @xmath6 labels @xmath7 hermitian matrices , on the other hand , another index @xmath8 is the local lorentz indices in @xmath9-dimensional curved manifold .",
    "@xmath10 is in the vector representation of the local lorentz group @xmath3 whose elements are denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "we describe curved space covariant derivative @xmath12 by the vielbein @xmath13 and the spin connection @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the curved space index and @xmath17 is the lorentz generator .",
    "commutator of these covariant derivatives gives @xmath18=-t^c{}_{,ab}\\nabla_c+r_{ab}{}^{cd}{\\cal o}_{cd}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are defended as @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "we do not impose torsion free condition by hand .",
    "thus the torsion @xmath19 is non - vanishing and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are independent of each other .",
    "next , to obtain a gravity equation , we apply this interpretation to the ikkt - type matrix model ( @xmath23 corresponds to the ikkt model ) .",
    "the bosonic part of the matrix model action is @xmath24[a_{(c)},a_{(d)}]\\delta^{(a)(c)}\\delta^{(b)(d)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] matrix equation of motion from this action becomes @xmath25=0 .",
    "\\label{mateqm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we now apply the hkk interpretation ( [ hkk ] ) to ( [ mateqm ] ) . with a help of a property ( 68 ) in @xcite , this equation becomes @xmath26=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this equation we obtain following equations @xmath27 where @xmath28 .    from a matrix jacobi identity @xmath29 + [ \\nabla_{(b)},[\\nabla_{(c)},\\nabla_{(a ) } ] ] + [ \\nabla_{(c)},[\\nabla_{(a)},\\nabla_{(b)}]]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have another set of equations : @xmath30 these equations are identical with bianchi identities of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus ( [ jacobi ] ) is automatically satisfied according to the definitions ( [ defoftr ] ) .",
    "see the appendix as a proof .",
    "+ equations ( [ fieldequation ] ) are derived from ikkt - type matrix model with euclidean signature . having a gravity equation once",
    ", we rotate it to have lorentzian signature in order to discuss classical solutions which describe manifolds with lorentzian signature",
    ". then , ( [ fieldequation ] ) with minkowski signature are basic equations which we will use from the next section .",
    "in this section we consider time dependent solutions with assumption of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "general ansatz for the spin connection under this assumption was already proposed in pgt @xcite .",
    "here we do not use this most general ansatz .",
    "rather we shall consider simple settings as possible , and examine the role of the torsion in our classical gravity",
    ".      we shall consider @xmath33-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic spacetime .",
    "for the metric and the spin connection we adapt following ansatz : @xmath34 under this ansatz non - vanishing components of torsion are @xmath35 substituting these forms into ( [ fieldequation ] ) , we obtain following equations : @xmath36 where ( [ feq31 ] ) and ( [ feq32 ] ) come from the first equation of ( [ fieldequation ] ) , and ( [ feq33 ] ) comes from the second equation of ( [ fieldequation ] ) .",
    "we have three equations here , but it turns out that ( [ feq33 ] ) can be written using ( [ feq31 ] ) and ( [ feq32 ] )",
    ". therefore we consider ( [ feq31 ] ) and ( [ feq32 ] ) as independent equations to determine @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "+ first , we find a solution of ( [ feq31])-([feq33 ] ) with following form : @xmath39 with an integral constant @xmath40 .",
    "the scale factor becomes @xmath41 , so it blows up as time with positive acceleration i.e. @xmath42 . in this solution",
    "all quantities calculated by riemann curvatures vanish because @xmath37 is zero .",
    "expansion of the space by @xmath43 is purely supported by the torsion .",
    "next we consider @xmath44 solution",
    ". we can solve ( [ feq31 ] ) by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an integral constant .",
    "substitute it into ( [ feq32 ] ) , we have @xmath47 a solution of ( [ feq34 ] ) can be written by @xmath48 and @xmath49 is determined by second order equation @xmath50 there are real solutions of @xmath49 if @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "the scale factor becomes @xmath53 and @xmath42 is possible if @xmath52 .    in the case of @xmath54",
    ", there is no simple analytic solution .",
    "however , ( [ feq34 ] ) tells us that its solution approaches to ( [ sol31 ] ) as @xmath55 increases .",
    "thus finally it blows up with positive acceleration . + every three cases which we have considered implys that introducing torsion gives expansion with positive acceleration to the universe",
    ".      we shall consider @xmath56-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic spacetime with two different scale factors .",
    "for metric and spin connections we adapt the following ansatz : @xmath57 under this ansatz non - vanishing components of torsion are @xmath58 by substituting these forms into ( [ fieldequation ] ) , we obtain following equations : @xmath59 where ( [ feq321 ] ) , ( [ feq322 ] ) and ( [ feq323 ] ) come from the first equation of ( [ fieldequation ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "( [ feq324 ] ) and ( [ feq325 ] ) come from the second equation of ( [ fieldequation ] ) .",
    "we have five equations here , but it turns out that one of these five is not an independent equation([feq321])=0 , one can see @xmath60 . ] .",
    "therefore we regard ( [ feq321])-([feq324 ] ) as independent equations to determine @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in the paper @xcite , torsion components @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "are identified with a time derivative of some scalar field .",
    "thus if we follow this proposal , additional constraint @xmath65 must be imposed .",
    "but here we do not impose this constraint and keep a broader possibility for the solution .    the same as in the previous subsection , the field equations above have the following curvature - less solution : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are integral constants .",
    "it is difficult to have an analytic result in the case of @xmath68 .",
    "here we consider linear approximation of the equations ( [ feq321])-([feq324 ] ) : @xmath69 these are easily solved by @xmath70 with integral constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 , for example . then we have @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath43 gives expansion or shrinking in @xmath76 directions , then @xmath77 gives shrinking or expansion in @xmath78 directions .",
    "acceleration @xmath79 is positive if @xmath80 .",
    "acceleration @xmath81 is negative at early time and becomes positive after @xmath82 .",
    "linear approximation may be valid during @xmath83",
    ". thus @xmath81 can be positive if @xmath84 , within the linear approximation .",
    "for large @xmath61 and @xmath62 we have to take care of full non - linearity of the equations ( [ feq321])-([feq324 ] ) .",
    "numerical computation is effective to do it .",
    "depending on initial conditions for @xmath85 , we may experience various periods of evolution ; @xmath86 give expansion or shrinking with or without acceleration .",
    "we left such detailed numerical analysis to future work .",
    "in this section we study solutions which describe static solutions with spherical symmetry . we restrict our interest to ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime . the same as in the previous sections , we do not intend to exhaust the most general ansatz which respects spherical symmetry for the spin connection .",
    "instead , we set a simple ansatz in order to investigate the role of torsion .",
    "+ we shall adopt the following ansatz for the metric and the spin connection : @xmath87 under this ansatz the non - vanishing components of the torsion are @xmath88 substituting these forms into ( [ fieldequation ] ) , we obtain the following equations : @xmath89-mab^2=0 , \\label{feq44 } \\\\ & & \\left(\\frac{1}{g}\\partial_r+a+2b - e\\right)\\left[\\frac{1}{g}b'+be\\right]-na^2b+q=0 , \\label{feq45 } \\\\ & & \\qquad p \\equiv b(b - e)+\\big(b^2-\\frac{1}{r^2}\\big ) , \\quad q \\equiv b\\big(\\frac{1}{r^2}-b^2\\big ) .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we introduced @xmath90 to write down these equations in more symmetric form .",
    "equations ( [ feq41 ] ) , ( [ feq42 ] ) and ( [ feq43 ] ) come from the first equation of ( [ fieldequation ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "( [ feq44 ] ) and ( [ feq45 ] ) come from the second equation of ( [ fieldequation ] ) .",
    "there are five equations , however , it turns out that one of them is not an independent equation , using ( [ feq41 ] ) , ( [ feq42 ] ) , ( [ feq43 ] ) and @xmath91 . ] .",
    "thus we use four equations ( [ feq41])-([feq44 ] ) to determine @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in the paper @xcite , @xmath94 and @xmath95",

    "the equations for @xmath100 and @xmath93 are @xmath101 recall that @xmath102 and @xmath103 , then we find two different solutions of ( [ feq46 ] ) . the first solution is @xmath104 with integral constants @xmath105 and @xmath106 . can be written as an elliptic integral . ]",
    "the second solution is @xmath107 with integral constants @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "@xmath93 behaves as @xmath115 , so this linear approximation breaks down not only in the small @xmath112 region but also in a very large @xmath112 region .",
    "an asymptotically flat solution can be constructed by a formal power series expansion . to do this we rewrite ( [ feq41])-([feq44 ] ) as first order differential equations : @xmath116 coefficients of formal @xmath117 expansion",

    "we obtain the metric @xmath120 and the torsion @xmath121 although we can formally continue to construct the power series solution to higher order , it is not clear whether the event horizon does appear or not .",
    "from the next subsection we examine a numerical integration to treat full non - linearity of equations and discuss the existence of horizon . in the numerical approach , a generic boundary condition does not give an asymptotically flat solution .",
    "probably the formal power series ( [ powers ] ) is not a convergent series and can not be a full solution .",
    "we may use it as an approximately solution which describes the asymptotic form of a spacetime with some matter in the inner region .",
    "a numerical approach is effective to treat full non - linearity of coupled differential equations . for convenience of the analysis ,",
    "we change variables in differential equations ( [ firstorder ] ) as @xmath122 after this , changing ( [ firstorder ] ) becomes @xmath123 we used the  desolve \" function of maple to obtain a numerical solution , imposing a boundary condition at @xmath124 .",
    "we have found four different classes of the numerical solutions which are characterized by singularities . some of them seem to correspond to the event horizon .",
    "we adopt an intuitive criterion for the horizon ; if numerically @xmath125 , then it is identified with the existence of the horizon , because @xmath126 is the speed of light seen by an observer at infinity in the case of schwarzschild spacetime .",

    "* type iv : there is a singularity at @xmath127 , but this is not a horizon , the solution exists in @xmath131 . around @xmath127 , it blows up with power laws .",
    "the curvature tensor @xmath20 and the scalar curvature @xmath132 can diverge at these horizons .",
    "however , it could be canceled by divergence of the torsion . according to the field equation ( [ fieldequation ] ) , a particular scalar combination : @xmath133 is always zero except at positions of sources . in this sense",
    "the divergences of the curvature tensor and the torsion at these horizons do not immediately mean the singularity of the solution .    in next subsection , we discuss these solutions in more detail .",
    "an example of type i solution is given by the boundary condition : @xmath134    ( -130,-140)@xmath135 ( -170,-70)@xmath136    ( -300,-20)@xmath137 ( -90,-20)@xmath138    figure [ de1 ] shows that there are two singularities for solutions .",

    "near @xmath166 , @xmath137 does not have divergent behavior ( at least numerically ) .",
    "it implies that @xmath137 and @xmath138 in figure [ de3 ] behave like @xmath172 we conclude that @xmath161 vanishes at @xmath158 using an argument similar to the previous ones .",

    "+ finally we point out that there are similarities between some of numerical solutions in this subsection and the analytic solution ( [ sol42 ] ) .",
    "in fact the type iii solution is similar to ( [ sol42 ] ) with @xmath176 , and the type iv solution is similar to ( [ sol42 ] ) with @xmath177 .",
    "we have studied classical solutions of the torsion gravity in empty spacetime , whose field equation stems from the matrix equation of motion of the ikkt model by using a hkk interpretation .",
    "the pgt is one of the known torsion gravities which is formulated by a lagrangian of the vielbein and the spin connection .",
    "our field equation is not derived from such lagrangian , so it is different from the pgt field equation , even though a matrix equation of motion itself is derived from a matrix model action . because of the lack of the gravitational lagrangian , no procedure for direct quantization of the vielbein and the spin connection is known in our approach .",
    "if their quantization rule is the same as the ordinary one , there is an anxiety about negative norm states caused from time - components of these fields as discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we treat these gravitational fields and their field equations as purely classical objects to describe semi - classical aspects of the large @xmath0 matrix model .",
    "time dependent solutions with homogeneity and isotropy were investigated in section 3 . we found that introducing torsion provides a simple mechanism to realize an accelerating expansion of spacetime . in pgt",
    "torsion degrees of freedom have been used to study cosmological problems like dark energy and inflation ( see @xcite , for example ) . to carry out further investigation along this line",
    ", we need to take care of contributions corresponding to the energy - momentum tensor from matter , which is beyond our scope in this paper .    time independent solutions with spherical symmetry were investigated in section 4 , with both analytical and numerical methods .",
    "we found solutions with singularities , which relate to the event horizons according to our criterion . except for the formal power series solution , all solutions with the torsion",
    "are not asymptotically flat .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is power law .",
    "it is contrast to pgt , in which an asymptotically flat solution has been found analytically @xcite ( several asymptotically non - flat solutions were also found @xcite ) .",
    "this would imply that torsions in our study are constrained to be very small in physically acceptable solutions , in order to well describe the solar system in present day gev by measurement @xcite . ] .",
    "however this observation itself does not prohibit a possibility of finding some solutions with a large effect of torsion in past or future period , which describes possible evolutions of the universe . more precise investigation on the structure of these solution and their systematic classification are future problems .",
    "we would like to thank yosuke imamura and chih - wei wang for discussions and comments .",
    "we also thank to neil russell for a comment about constraints on torsion .",
    "we use differential forms @xmath178 and @xmath179 with @xmath180 .",
    "then ( [ defoftr ] ) can be written as the following form : @xmath181 where exterior derivative @xmath9 acts as @xmath182 on a differential form @xmath155 .",
    "we have introduced a one form @xmath183 . to obtain ( [ torsion2 ] ) , we also used a property @xmath184 which follows from @xmath185 .",
    "now we may drive bianchi identities using ( [ torsion2 ] ) and ( [ curvature2 ] ) .",
    "first we take the exterior derivative of ( [ torsion2 ] ) , then obtain @xmath186 using ( [ torsion2 ] ) and ( [ curvature2 ] ) , then ( [ dtorsion2 ] ) becomes @xmath187 in this way we obtained the first bianchi identity @xmath188 similarly , from ( [ curvature2 ] ) , we can derive the second bianchi identity @xmath189 here we see that equations ( [ jacobi ] ) which follow from the matrix jacobi identity are identical with bianchi identities ( [ bianchi1 ] ) and ( [ bianchi2 ] ) .",
