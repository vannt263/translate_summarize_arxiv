    "brown dwarfs ( @xmath11 ) are an important class of object to test the mass dependence in the formation and early evolution of stars and planets . as of today , the origin of these substellar objects it not clear @xcite ; they may be the result of turbulent fragmentation or ejections from multiple systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , brown dwarfs might have been ejected from protoplanetary disks @xcite where they have formed by disk fragmentation , and we might observe the overlap of star and planet forming processes .",
    "further issues that can be addressed by investigating young brown dwarfs are , among others , the evolution of accretion disks ( e.g. , the impact of photoevaporation ) , the formation of multiple systems @xcite , the mass dependence of planet formation , and the early regulation of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the prerequisite for tackling these issues is to obtain a reliable picture of the frequency and properties of young brown dwarfs .",
    "the currently available surveys are affected by two major biases : a ) in most regions they do not extend below the deuterium - burning limit ( @xmath12 ) , i.e. they do not cover the regime of free - floating objects with planetary masses . in several regions , however , it has been shown that the mass function extends to 0.01@xmath13 @xcite or even below , and a lower mass limit ( the `` bottom of the imf '' ) has not been found yet , which indicates that our census of substellar objects is incomplete at the lowest masses ; b )  some of the deepest surveys are biased by design , either because they are based on mid - infrared data from spitzer and thus will only find objects surrounded by dusty disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) or because they are carried out using narrow - band methane imaging , which probes only a specific range of spectral types ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while samples obtained with these methods are useful to constrain the mass function , they are of limited use for other purposes ( for example , spitzer samples can not reliably probe disk lifetimes as a function of mass ) .",
    "our program sonyc ( substellar objects in nearby young clusters ) aims to mitigate these selection effects and to help in establishing a more complete census of brown dwarfs .",
    "the project is based on three basic principles : + 1 ) by making extensive use of 4- to 8-m - class telescopes , we aim to reach mass limits of @xmath14 and below , with the specific goal of probing the bottom of the imf .",
    "+ 2 ) the primary means of identifying candidates is broadband imaging in the optical and near - infrared , thus aiming to detect the photosphere .",
    "this results in large samples of candidates , i.e. requires extensive follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "this dataset is complemented by publicly available spitzer data .",
    "+ 3 ) by probing several star forming regions we want to probe for environmental differences in the frequency and properties of substellar objects .",
    "so far , we have published results for two regions , ngc@xmath21333 @xcite and @xmath15 ophiuchus @xcite .",
    "in ngc@xmath21333 we identify 19 substellar objects , 12 of them previously unknown .",
    "we tentatively find a cutoff in the mass function between 0.01 and 0.02@xmath13 .",
    "this may be the first sign that we have reached the bottom of the imf .",
    "in @xmath15 ophiuchus we spectroscopically confirm a previously unknown brown dwarf , and identify a number of new candidates based on spitzer data . in this region",
    ", however , the current census is highly incomplete due to strong and variable extinction .    in this paper",
    "we present the sonyc results for the star forming region chamaeleon i ( hereafter cha - i ) .",
    "cha - i harbors a rich population of known ysos @xcite , most of them grouped in two clusters , each dominated by a bright a star .",
    "cha - i is less compact than ngc1333 and has less extinction than @xmath15-oph .",
    "previous surveys have identified a significant number of substellar objects .",
    "extensive photometric and spectroscopic studies of the region result in 40 spectroscopically confirmed objects below the hydrogen - burning limit . among these",
    "are a few objects with estimated masses at or below the deuterium - burning limit @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we will use the current membership census , referred to as the `` luhman census '' , by luhman ( 2007 , 215 objects , his table 6 ) , complemented by the new members in and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* objects ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "observations and data reduction are described in section  [ s2 ] . in section  [ s3 ]",

    "this study is primarily based on data from the european southern observatory , obtained in runs 078.c-0049 and 382.c-0174 .",
    "the first campaign provided deep optical and near - infrared imaging . from the optical dataset we selected a list of candidate members which were observed using multi - object spectroscopy in the second run . additionally , we made use of the archival spitzer images for our target regions . in the following",
    "we describe the observations , the basic reduction and photometry .",
    "the fields covered by our surveys are outlined in figure  [ spatial ] .",

    "our goal is to identify young members of cha - i with masses in the substellar regime , which typically corresponds to objects with effective temperature below 3000@xmath2k .",
    "the photometrically chosen sample might be contaminated by embedded stellar members of cha - i , reddened background m - type stars , and ( less likely ) late m- and early l - type objects in the foreground .",
    "the red portion of m - dwarf spectra is dominated by molecular features ( mainly tio and vo ; @xcite ) , which allows a relatively simple preliminary selection of candidates based on visual inspection .",
    "here we included all the objects with a clear evidence , but also , for the sake of caution , those objects with only a tentative evidence of molecular features .",
    "another property that was used in the selection is the slope , which should be positive in the red portion of the optical regime for m - type stars .",
    "earlier stellar types typically have negative slopes , or appear flat ( late k - type ) . among the rejected spectra we mainly find flat spectra with no , or with very weak indication of molecular features ( late k - dwarfs , or reddened earlier - type stars ) , and reddened featureless spectra ( background or embedded stars of spectral type earlier than k ) .",

    ", we set the wavelength limits at 6200 and 8500   .",
    "the cut at the red side is set to exclude the fringe - dominated portion of the spectra , while the cut at 6200    is set to avoid the problematic region around 6100@xmath2 , where the models typically overestimate the observed flux .",

    "we show only the objects with the best - fit @xmath70 at or below 3800@xmath2k because the objects found at the edge of the fitting grid could be even warmer .",

    "as shown extensively in the literature , this diagram serves as a robust diagnostic for the presence of circumstellar dust around a particular object @xcite .",
    "objects with disks and/or envelopes show excess in the two irac colors .",
    "the overwhelming majority of our sources appears around the origin of the plot , which precludes the presence of a disk .",
    "a small group of 20 objects has significant excess in both axes and is clearly distinct from the bulk of the datapoints ( marked with crosses ) .",
    "18 of them are known members according to the luhman census .",
    "the remaining 2 are listed in table [ tjksp ] , and marked with squares in fig .",
    "[ mircmd ] . to our knowledge , these objects are new candidate members of cha - i , although they both look slightly extended in the near - infrared images and could be galaxies .",
    "for a definite statement about the membership of the new candidates , spectroscopy is needed .",
    "based on our optical and @xmath85 surveys we can put limits on the number of very low mass sources that are missing in the current census of ysos in cha - i . in figure",
    "[ spatial ] we show the spatial coverage of our @xmath86 survey ( solid lines ) , the positions of the known members ( black dots ) , including the known brown dwarfs ( diamonds ) , the two candidates from table [ tjksp ] ( squares ) , and the two new candidate members from spectroscopy ( circles ) .",
    "our fields cover 88 out of 227 known members ( 38% ) , from which 67 are recovered in our iz catalog .",
    "64 members are recovered in the @xmath6 catalog , including 21 with disks .",
    "since the object density across cha - i is highly variable , we consider it best to scale the numbers with the fraction of known objects covered by the survey , and not with the fraction of total area .",
    "the scaling factor for obtaining the number of potential new candidates in the regions not covered by our survey is then @xmath87 .",
    "@xcite derived extinction map of the chamaeleon - musca region based on optical star counts .",
    "here we define the extent of cha - i as the region on the plane of the sky outlined by a circle of radius @xmath88 and centered at ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , and within the contours of @xmath91 .",
    "only @xmath92 of this area is at @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , when deriving mass equivalent to certain brightness limit , we consider only extinctions below @xmath94 .",
    "let us consider the sources in the candidate selection box of the optical part of the survey in figure@xmath2[optcmd ] , that are brighter than the limit for spectroscopy , found at @xmath95 .",
    "the upper limit placed at @xmath96 corresponds to masses of ( @xmath97)@xmath13 , and the lower limit @xmath67 to ( @xmath98)@xmath13 , in both cases for @xmath99 .",
    "the estimates are based on dusty00 and cond03 evolutionary models . from the 45 sources in the box ,",
    "15 are known members according to the luhman census .",
    "we obtained spectra for 9 of the remaining 30 objects , and find 1 potential new m - type member , falling above the substellar temperature limit .",
    "from this we conclude that there are potentially 2 additional missing members in the @xmath100 range , in the surveyed part of the cluster .",
    "the total number of the missing vlm members with @xmath101 in cha - i is thus @xmath102 ( unsurveyed + surveyed parts of the cluster ) .    in our @xmath85 survey",
    ", we find zero new objects with disks brighter than @xmath103mag , and 2 potential new members with disks fainter than @xmath103mag . according to the cond03 and dusty00 models",
    ", the @xmath103 limit corresponds to ( 0.005 - 0.008)@xmath13 for @xmath99 , similar to the @xmath67 limit .",
    "these numbers have to be scaled with the disk fraction ( @xmath104% , according to @xcite ) and the coverage .",
    "the total number of potentially missing very low mass members in cha - i is @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108mag .",
    "this estimate relies on three assumptions :    \\a ) the disk fraction does not change as a function of mass . in cha - i , @xcite find that the disk fraction is roughly constant at @xmath6450% from 0.01 to 0.3@xmath57 .",
    "this is not necessarily the case in other star forming regions , as shown , for example , by @xcite and @xcite . below the deuterium - burning limits ,",
    "the fraction of the disk - bearing objects is even more uncertain .",
    "\\b ) the spatial distribution does not change as a function of mass .",
    "it is conceivable that brown dwarfs are scattered towards the outskirts of cha - i whereas the higher mass stars are more concentrated towards the cloud core . from the current census",
    ", however , there is no evidence for brown dwarfs being distributed different than stars @xcite .",
    "\\c ) the spitzer survey fully covers our @xmath6 area . in figure [ spatial ]",
    "we overplot the area on the deep and shallow irac images with dashed and dash - dotted lines , respectively .",
    "our fields 1 and 4 with the highest density of known members ( 55/88 ) are completely covered by the deep irac images .",
    "the shallow irac images cover about 5/8 of the remaining fields .",
    "however , in these regions the density of known members is significantly lower and they are offset from the two main cloud cores in cha - i .",
    "therefore we do not consider the missing coverage a serious limitation .    in summary , from both the optical and the @xmath85 survey",
    "we conclude that the current census of members in cha - i is mostly complete down to @xmath109 for @xmath110 . within these limits and barring a significant mass dependence in disk fraction or spatial distribution , the number of missing object is @xmath111 .",
    "there may still be a significant number of unidentified members below this threshold or at higher extinctions .      based on the current census in cha - i",
    ", we can estimate the ratio of low - mass stars ( @xmath112 ) to substellar objects . as substellar objects , we assume all objects with @xmath113k , i.e. of the spectral type m6 or later",
    ". there are 183 low - mass stars in the luhman census . here",
    "we do not include the two new low - mass - star candidates found in this work , since their membership yet has to be confirmed .",
    "the number of substellar objects in the current census is 40 .",
    "10 out of these 40 objects are of spectral type m9 or later ( @xmath114k ) .",
    "1@xmath2myr old objects at these low temperatures would have masses @xmath115 , according to the dusty00 and cond03 models .",
    "ratio of low - mass - stars to bds in cha - i is therefore @xmath116 , in agreement with the 3.38.5 limits found in other star forming regions ( @xcite ; calculated for the mass range at and above @xmath117 ) .",
    "this number represents the upper limit on the star - to - bd ratio , since we are probably still missing some objects .",
    "the ratio between the number of pmos to bds is currently @xmath118 .",
    "this number , however , is subject to a large uncertainty , due to missing bds and also a much larger number of missing pmos . from our statistics",
    ", we can give a crude estimate of the number of missing pmos in cha - i .",
    "the bd / pmo limit at @xmath119 corresponds to @xmath120 for @xmath99 .",
    "for the objects with @xmath121 in the selection box in figure  [ optcmd ] , and following the same reasoning as in section  [ missing ] , we estimate that the number of missing objects is @xmath122 .",
    "this means that the total number of missing bds is @xmath123 .",
    "all remaining missing objects should be pmos . down to @xmath67 ( @xmath103 )",
    "this gives 47 pmos . from our @xmath85 survey in section  [ missing ]",
    "we estimated the number of missing objects below this limit to be @xmath107 . in total , this estimate gives 413 missing pmos in cha - i .",
    "the pmo - to - bd ratio in cha - i then lies in the range between @xmath124 and @xmath125 while the ratio of pmos to the total cluster population becomes @xmath126 .",
    "we note that the ratios derived here should be taken with caution because they are subject to large uncertainties due to scaling from small numbers .",
    "we can compare the derived numbers with those found in other star forming regions . in @xmath127  ori , @xcite find the lower limit for the pmo versus bd ratio of @xmath128 . in the onc ,",
    "@xcite estimate the fraction of pmos in the total cluster population to be in range ( 114)@xmath129 .",
    "highly variable extinction and age uncertainty make an unbiased census in the onc difficult .",
    "while these numbers are in line with our cha - i estimates , significantly different behavior is observed in ngc  1333 .",
    "@xcite report an overabundance of bds relative to low - mass stars ( ratio of @xmath130 ) , and a deficit of pmos .",
    "they find no pmos in ngc  1333 , although clearly being able to do so , as judged from the completeness limit of the survey . while the reason for this observed difference is not obviouos , it might indicate that the environment may leave an imprint on the shape of the imf at the lowest masses . the major contributions to the uncertainties in the pmo / bd ratio are introduced by the completeness limits ( most of the surveys are incomplete in the pmo regime ) , and the mass estimates that are based on the models , together with the age and distance uncertainties .",
    "high and variable extinction that is typical for most star forming regions additionally complicates this situation , as color - magnitude criteria used for candidate selection may also include more massive members at higher extinctions . here",
    "we must stress the importance of obtaining follow - up spectroscopy of the photometrically - selected candidates , because only the spectra can give us the information about the youth ( and thus membership ) and temperature of the observed objects .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , and also apparent from figure [ spatial ] , the spatial distribution of brown dwarfs does not significantly differ from the distribution of stars in cha - i .",
    "this indicates that the ejection from multiple systems can not be the dominant process of brown dwarf formation in this cluster .",
    "any other statement concerning the relative importance of bd formation scenarios is not possible based only on ratios of bds to stars or pmos to bds .",
    "to some extent , any of the proposed models can successfully reproduce the observed imf .",
    "for example , in simulations of the turbulent cloud fragmentation by , abundances of brown dwarfs in different star forming regions can be matched by an appropriate combination of cloud density , temperature and the mach number of the turbulence . to constrain the relative contributions of different formation mechanisms to the observed substellar population in different star forming regions , we need secondary indicators that provide a more effective ways to distinguish between different scenarios ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these secondary indicators include spatial distribution of stars and bds in star forming regions , possible kinematic differences between the two populations , and binary properties ( frequency , separations , mass ratios ) and how they depend on the primary mass @xcite .",
    "this paper is the third in the series of papers presented in the framework of the sonyc project ( short for substellar objects in nearby young clusters ) .",
    "we have obtained deep optical and near - infrared observations of 4 fields in the chamaeleon - i star forming region , using vimos at the eso vlt and sofi at the eso ntt .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of the candidates selected from the photometry was obtained using vimos / vlt . in the following ,",
    "we summarize the survey and its most important results .    1 .   in our imaging survey , we reach completeness limits of 23.0 in @xmath19 , 18.3 in @xmath28 , and 16.7 in @xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to mass limits of @xmath131 , for @xmath99 and the distance of @xmath1160@xmath2pc ( based on dusty00 and cond03 models ) .",
    "this is more than 2@xmath2magnitudes deeper in all three bands than the completeness limits of the major part of the currently most extensive cha - i survey presented in @xcite . only one field in @xcite , covering @xmath132 ( equivalent to a quarter of our coverage ) ,",
    "did achieve photometric depths comparable to those presented here .",
    "the spatial coverage of our survey is 0.25@xmath2deg@xmath3 .",
    "it includes 38% of the previously known members of cha - i from the luhman census .",
    "3 .   from the optical photometry ,",
    "we select 142 objects with @xmath36 colors as expected for substellar members of the cluster .",
    "45 of these objects are above the @xmath67 limit observed in our spectroscopic follow - up , and for 18 of these sources we have obtained optical spectra .",
    "we have also obtained spectra for 211 randomly selected objects outside the selection box , including several known members .",
    "we find two objects with spectra consistent with the spectral type m , but do not have enough information to clarify membership .",
    "none of the two new potential members is substellar , as the temperature estimate resulting from the spectral fitting are well above 3000@xmath2k .",
    "4 .   our jk photometric survey combined with the spitzer data yields 2 new candidate members . the membership for these objects has to yet be confirmed by spectroscopy .",
    "5 .   based on the results of our survey ,",
    "while scaling for the coverage and disk fraction , we estimate that the number of the missing low - mass members down to @xmath133 and @xmath110 in cha - i is @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath134 of the total number of members according to the current census .",
