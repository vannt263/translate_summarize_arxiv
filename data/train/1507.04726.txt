    "many - body perturbation theory is one of the most common methodologies used to study quantum transport problems in which interactions among charge carriers or between them and other constituents play a significant role .",
    "the method is based on diagrammatic perturbation theory for the non - equilibrium green s functions together with a set of standard approximations to describe the many - body effects  @xcite . although these approximations have been widely used , and thus their properties explored , in the case of steady - state transport  @xcite , much less is known on their performance in the explicitly time - dependent case  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for systems with moderate to strong electron - phonon interactions in which interesting phenomena like bistability and hysteresis have been observed  @xcite . as such phenomena are typically driven by many - body interactions ,",
    "it is natural to ask whether or not the approximate method can describe the relevant physics even qualitatively .",
    "this is the case , for example , with the aforementioned bistability whose existence has been subject to doubt on the quality of the method itself  @xcite .",
    "the recent efforts to realize more sophisticated , but computationally more demanding , approximations have enabled addressing these questions also in the framework of time - dependent many - body perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "it is important to study these approximations on a wide scope to understand when they are predictive and the results can be trusted .",
    "time - dependent many - body perturbation theory has also been recently applied to study vibrational effects in ab - initio charge carrier dynamics in semiconductors e.g.  relaxation processes after a laser excitation  @xcite .",
    "this has become possible as further simplifications , in particular the generalized kadanoff - baym ansatz  @xcite ( gkba ) , have been developed to keep the approach computationally tractable along with the growing system sizes .",
    "one could also in this manner study time - dependent phenomena in realistic molecular systems continuing along the lines of the early studies of vibrational effects in photoelectron spectra of molecules  @xcite in this context , in order to understand the reasons behind the successes or failures of the methods , it is neccessary to understand the many - body approximations underlying the additional simplifications such as gkba .",
    "there are also topical fields in optoelectronics , such as cavity quantum electrodynamics , and optomechanics in which one deals with formally similar systems as in the quantum transport case .",
    "time - dependent many - body perturbation theory has been used in these fields e.g.  to derive time - dependent density functionals with preliminary results giving an indication of their quality  @xcite .",
    "there is however even less known about the properties of the approximations than in the more established quantum transport setup .    in this work ,",
    "we present an extension of a previously introduced numerical method  @xcite to study time - dependent , inhomogeneous systems of interacting electrons and phonons .",
    "this is also an extension of the equilibrium formalism which we introduced in our earlier work in ref .  .",
    "our approach is a variant of time - dependent many - body perturbation theory based on the kadanoff - baym equations ( kbe )  @xcite .",
    "here we introduce the relevant equations , time - dependent many - body approximations , and discuss some of their characteristic features e.g.  the mean - field , hartree ( h ) approximation is shown to lead to the semi - classical ehrenfest equations . the time - dependent partially  @xcite ( gd ) and fully  @xcite ( gd ) self - consistent born approximations",
    "are introduced to study correlation effects beyond the mean - field level .",
    "these many - body approximations are in particular suited to study time - dependent quantum transport with electron - phonon interactions as they are particle number conserving in the sense of baym  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", the method is instead applied to a finite system since this allows us to assess its performance by comparing the approximate results to an exact solution .",
    "although the method can handle complex time - dependent perturbations , we restrict ourselves here to linear response functions obtained by time - propagating the kadanoff - baym equations .",
    "the density response function @xmath0 obtained in this manner is equivalent to a solution of the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) with an integral kernel which is a functional derivative @xmath1 of the self - energy @xmath2 with respect to the electron propagator @xmath3  @xcite.the kernel therefore consists of dressed propagators and is fully frequency - dependent in the born approximations .",
    "this level of approximation has , to our best knowledge , not yet been reached in the standard frequency - domain approach even for the much studied purely electronic systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the phonon propagator is determined by the electronic response function , by comparing to the equilibrium phonon propagator we are able to comment on whether or not this additional level of sophistication amounts to improved results .",
    "lastly , we would like to note that although this paper is geared towards electrons and phonons , the method is in fact applicable to a variety of systems of interacting fermions and bosons e.g.  electron - photon models ( rabi  @xcite ) and electron - plasmon models ( lundqvist  @xcite ) .    as the application , we study a homogeneous , two - site , two - electron holstein model which is a standard model describing interacting electrons and phonons  @xcite .",
    "this continues along the lines of our prior work in ref .",
    "in which we focused on ground - state properties and studying the localizing effect of the electron - phonon interaction by comparing the many - body approximations against exact benchmark results .",
    "as a result , we found that the self - energy approximations gave rise to spontaneous symmetry - breaking characterizable by an asymmetric electron density and nuclear displacement .",
    "the symmetry - broken solutions as well as solutions obtained by enforcing symmetry were analyzed with the help of total energies , energy components , and natural occupation numbers .",
    "it was concluded that the symmetry - breaking can be seen physically to mimic the bipolaronic crossover of the underlying system in which two nearly free electrons form a bound pair with an accompanying nuclear displacement .",
    "moreover , out of the symmetric solutions , only the fully self - consistent born approximation showed evidence of partially describing this crossover .",
    "here we instead investigate the equilibrium electron and phonon propagators , and linear response functions of the same system using time - dependent many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the equilibrium propagators are studied in frequency - domain which gives a more detailed view to the properties of the approximations , and allows us to re - evaluate the physical picture obtained from the various energies .",
    "the linear response calculations on the other hand allow us to understand better the nature of the symmetric and asymmetric solutions found in our earlier work .",
    "in particular , we show that they are equivalent to the equilibrium solutions of the semi - classical equations of the dicke model  @xcite in which the appearance of the asymmetric solution represents the super - radiant phase transition in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "this transition moreover appears as a bifurcation leading to instability of the symmetric solution which in a finite system is not in agreement with the exact solution .",
    "one of the open questions addressed in this work concerns the stability of the symmetric and asymmetric solutions when going beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "in particular , we answer to the question whether or not the symmetric solution retains its stability in the born approximations . once stable solutions have been identified , we turn our attention to the linear response functions which are used to assess how the approximations describe the system reacting to a weak perturbation . there is a lot of systematic work on static i.e.  zero - frequency susceptibilities of either finite clusters  @xcite , or extended finite  @xcite and infinite  @xcite dimensional systems with a focus on e.g  charge - density wave phase transition temperatures . here",
    "we thus extend these studies beyond the static case by considering fully frequency - dependent response functions of a finite system .",

    "this feature instead emerges qualitatively correctly in the fully self - consistent approximation .",

    "we have introduced a method based on time - dependent many - body perturbation theory aimed at studying interacting electrons and phonons .",

    "the method has been applied to investigate both the non - neutral and neutral excitation spectra of a two - site , two - electron holstein model .",
    "we have presented results for the frequency - domain ground - state electron and phonon propagators , as well as for the density - density and displacement - displacement linear response functions .",

    ", we found that the approximations studied here support multiple , concurrently co - existing solutions some of which exhibit a broken reflection symmetry .",
    "the asymmetric solutions were found once the electron - phonon interaction @xmath114 reached a critical value @xmath184 , and were understood to mimic the bipolaronic crossover of the exact solution .",
    "the asymmetric solutions were furthermore found to be the lowest energy solutions for a large range of parameters .",
    "the total energies , and natural occupation numbers , also suggested that the symmetric solution of the fully self - consistent born approximation describes partially the crossover to a bipolaronic state . in the present work",
    ", we studied the frequency structure of the ground state propagators for a restricted range of adiabatic ratios @xmath121 and interactions @xmath122 $ ] which allows us to complete some of the observations made in  ref .  .",
    "firstly , the frequency - integrated observables obtained from the electron propagator are in a better qualitative agreement with exact results than the frequency - resolved objects themselves .",
    "in particular , our results show that none of the approximations give an electron propagator in which there is a rigid shift or redistribution of the spectral weight comparable to the exact solution for high @xmath178 interactions .",
    "the phonon propagator does not moreover show a clear spectral fingerprint of a double - well structure in the fully self - consistent born approximation for the parameters considered . as all of these features have been identified as spectral signatures of a bipolaronic state",
    ", our results here favor the statement that none of the approximations describe even partially the bipolaronic crossover for the parameters considered .",
    "this said , the results for the electron propagator can be roughly summarized by concluding that the hartree , partially self - consistent born , and fully self - consistent born approximations agree with the exact results up to very weak @xmath138 , weak @xmath334 , and weak to intermediate @xmath148 interactions , respectively .",
    "the non - interacting phonon propagator used in the hartree and partially self - consistent born approximations is only valid for very weak @xmath138 interactions while the dressed propagator of the fully self - consistent born approximation agrees reasonably well with the exact results up to borderline strong @xmath164 interactions .",
    "the linear response functions studied in the present work are obtained by time - propagation starting either from a symmetric or an asymmetric ground state solution . in the case",
    "@xmath310 , these solutions co - exits and we find that the symmetric solutions of the hartree and partially self - consistent born approximations are unstable , while the asymmetric solutions are stable , against a small asymmetric perturbation .",
    "the symmetric and asymmetric solutions of the fully self - consistent born approximation are , on the other hand , shown to be stable against the same perturbation . by identifying the stable ground state solutions , we have been able to evaluate linear response functions corresponding to these solutions . in particular ,",
    "the density - density response function obtained in the hartree and partially self - consistent born approximations is shown to have a zero - frequency component which appears and its intensity diverges as @xmath114 approaches @xmath184 . in the hartree approximation , this is caused by the build - up of a double - well structure in its ground state energy surface exactly at @xmath155 and by the need of the mean - field to minimize the total energy .",
    "our results further show that the fully self - consistent born approximation does not have a similar divergence .",
    "the comparison of the exact and approximate density - density response functions confirms that the range of validity of the many - body approximations is roughly the same as for the case of equilibrium propagators .",
    "in particular , none of the many - body approximations were able to describe the lowest excitation of the exact response function for strong interactions @xmath178 for which it is the dominant feature of the exact response function . by analyzing this excitation ,",
    "we further identified it as a signature of a bipolaronic system , and hence in agreement with the conclusions based on the equilibrium propagators , this suggests that the approximations do not describe the crossover to the bipolaronic state .",
    "finally , we could by time - propagation obtain another phonon propagator associated with a highly sophisticated self - energy , although a non - selfconsistent one .",
    "the results show that although the propagators obtained in the partially and fully self - consistent approximations are better than the equilibrium propagator of the fully self - consistent born approximation for the perturbative @xmath138 interactions , they lead to deterioration of the qualitative spectral properties for higher interactions .",
    "this suggests that , at least in this case , it is either important to maintain self - consistency , or that instead of infinite partial summations of dressed self - energy diagrams it is better to consider truncated approximations .    in order to go beyond the approximations studied here in many - body perturbation",
    "theory one needs to introduce vertex corrections which are in particular needed to improve the properties of the electron propagator .",
    "this is realizable in an equilibrium theory but leads to a substantial increase in the complexity of the time - domain method which makes the inclusion of vertex corrections challenging with the current computational resources .",
    "the two - time equations can be however cast as one - time equations via the gkba  @xcite which is a possible way to overcome the numerical challenge and reduce more advanced approximations tractable . on the other hand e.g.  in cavity quantum electrodynamics",
    "already our weak interactions are considered strong and thus the approximations used here could be a valuable asset for investigating non - linear time - dependent phenomena .",
    "in this context our results provide a basis for studying the approximation in an explicitly time - dependent situation , and for understanding properties of further approximations e.g.  the gkba which could be used in order to address physics of larger or more realistic systems .",

    "the hartree approximation is shown here to be equivalent to the time - dependent self - consistent field ( tdscf ) approach and to the semi - classical ehrenfest approximation .",
    "this equivalence is shown by deriving the time - dependent self - consistent field equations , noting that they reduce to the ehrenfest equations of motion , and finally by showing that their solutions can be used to construct the phonon field expectation value , and the electron propagator of the hartree approximation .",
    "we begin by introducing the product ansatz @xmath335 where @xmath336 and @xmath337 consist of only electronic and phononic degrees of freedom , respectively . by substituting this ansatz to the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath338 and projecting it to the states @xmath337 and @xmath336 , we arrive at the time - dependent self - consistent field equations  @xcite @xmath339 where @xmath340 are the phonon field expectation value and the reduced density matrix . in the derivation .",

    "taking advantage of this property and the bilinearity of the equation for @xmath343 in terms of the electronic operators , we arrive at the ehrenfest equations of motion    [ eq : ehrenfestequations ] @xmath344    such that @xmath343 can be written as a slater determinant of the time - dependent orbitals @xmath345 . in order to relate these orbitals to the electron propagator in the hartree approximation",

    "correspond to a set of non - linear eigenvalue equations for the eigenvalues @xmath347 and eigenvectors @xmath348 .",

    "the jacobian matrix @xmath362 is a function of the unperturbed solution @xmath363 which is in our case obtained by propagating either the symmetric or asymmetric ground state solution of the equilibrium hartree equations given in eq .",

    "the equation for the response function is linear , and hence admits the solution @xmath369 where we restored the explicit time - dependence .",
