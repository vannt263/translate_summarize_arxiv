    "the research fields of magnonics and , on a broader scale , magnon spintronics , which includes interfacing to electric charge transport phenomena , aim at the utilization of magnons , the quanta of spin - wave excitation in a magnetic material , as information carriers in a next generation of logic devices beyond conventional cmos@xcite .",
    "this research area has attracted prominent interest in the recent years due to the demonstration of various game - changing devices such as magnonic all - linear time - inverters@xcite , magnon transistors@xcite and reconfigurable magnonic waveguides@xcite , which are just a few , yet instructive , examples . however , for a successful application of magnonics on the micro- and nanometer scale , the research field still faces several challenges .",
    "one of the main issues is the spin - wave damping , which is substantial in most conventionally used , cmos - compatible ferromagnetic metals@xcite .",
    "while recent studies show the large potential to decrease this damping by material engineering@xcite , a reduction of the spin - wave damping comes together with a restriction of the maximum tolerable amplitude of the spin - wave excitation if nonlinear phenomena are to be avoided@xcite .",
    "this is , for example , the case if several spin waves are conveying information encoded in their phase in parallel in a magnonic waveguide .",
    "hence , in future magnonic devices , spin waves with small amplitudes and energies in the @xmath0- to @xmath1-range are envisioned to propagate through extended magnonic networks on a chip , conveying information through spin - wave conduits which feature a small , yet finite damping",
    ". therefore , spin - wave amplifiers are of crucial importance to restore the spin - wave amplitude during the course of their propagation as well as to increase the spin - wave intensity to allow for a convenient detection at the output of the network and interconnects to conventional electronics .    in the context of a phase - conserving , mode- and frequency - selective amplification of traveling spin waves ,",
    "the process of parallel pumping has , so far , proven superior to other approaches of spin - wave amplification , such as the reduction of the spin - wave damping by spin transfer torque ( stt)@xcite .",
    "parallel pumping , or parallel parametric amplification , results from the interaction of selected spin waves with a sufficiently large dynamic effective magnetic field , which acts in parallel to the static magnetization and features two times the frequency of these spin waves .",
    "any dynamic effective field modulation with proper frequency can act as source of parametric excitation .",
    "classically , this effective field , referred to as the pumping field , has been provided by a microwave field . in this case , the parametric process creates pairs of magnons by the splitting of microwave photons .",
    "alternatively , the pumping field can be provided by a variation of any magnetic control parameter , such as , e. g. , a dynamic variation of the magnetic anisotropy or an incident spin current .",
    "one general key feature of the process of parallel pumping is the creation of pairs of magnons which are mutually connected in their phase@xcite . due to this ,",
    "the application of parallel pumping goes way beyond a mere amplification of spin waves .",
    "since the relative phase between the created waves can be externally controlled , this allows for a phase - sensitive amplification , which can discriminate logic values encoded in the spin - wave phase@xcite .    in macroscopic systems ,",
    "the practical application of parallel pumping has suffered from the fact that the preferably amplified mode , referred to as the dominant mode , is generally not the signal carrying fundamental waveguide mode@xcite .",
    "the latter , which can be conveniently excited externally , features the largest group velocity and net magnetic moment of all modes available in a spin - wave waveguide .",
    "hence , it is the most interesting mode for magnonic applications .",
    "however , an efficient amplification of this mode could only be achieved under specific conditions .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that in microstructured magnonic waveguides and elliptical elements , the dominant mode can be tuned to be the fundamental mode@xcite . in this review",
    ", we will discuss this phenomenon as well as its consequences on the spin - wave amplification in these microscopic systems .",
    "we briefly review linear spin waves in thin films and microstructured waveguides and introduce the basic equations to describe the effect of parallel parametric amplification on the spin - wave dynamics in section [ theoback ] .",
    "consequently , in section [ pgen ] , we present examples of spin - wave generation by parallel parametric amplification of thermal spin waves in several geometries , showing the versatility and the advantages of this technique in comparison to other excitation schemes . in section [ pamp ]",
    ", we review the amplification of traveling , externally excited spin - wave packets in magnonic waveguides , addressing the potential and the limitations of this amplification scheme .",
    "finally , we provide an overview over the recent applications and novel concepts of spin - wave manipulation and characterization by means of parallel parametric amplification in section [ nov ] , and , ultimately , a brief conclusion of the review is provided in section [ concl ] .",
    "we begin with the presentation of the theory of linear spin waves .",
    "it describes the unperturbed eigenstates of the small - amplitude spin - wave excitation in a magnetic material .",
    "the spatial confinement in magnetic microstructures leads to the formation of quantized , laterally standing spin - wave modes in these systems .",
    "however , already in a thin , laterally extended ferromagnetic film , the finite thickness gives rise to quantized standing spin - wave modes across its thickness , referred to as perpendicular standing spin - wave ( pssw ) modes@xcite .",
    "in very thin films , experiments involving propagating spin waves and their theoretical description are restricted to the lowest , fundamental thickness mode , which features a quasi - uniform magnetization distribution across the thickness of the film .",
    "this is due to the fact that higher modes , which feature a non - uniform magnetization distribution across the thickness , exhibit a large exchange energy and , thus , are found at frequencies beyond the frequency - range typically studied in these experiments .",
    "for instance , for a @xmath2 thick film from the magnetic material ni@xmath3fe@xmath4 ( permalloy ) featuring standard parameters , exchange constant @xmath5 , gyromagnetic ratio @xmath6 . ] , the first standing spin wave modes lies at frequencies above @xmath7 and , thus , more than @xmath8 above the frequency of the uniform ferromagnetic resonance at @xmath9 for an effective magnetic field of @xmath10 within the waveguide .    for the uniform mode in an isotropic , in - plane magnetized film ,",

    "if the thin film is structured into a spin - wave waveguide , i.e. , a thin rectangular slab , an additional quantization of the wavevector @xmath14 is introduced across the width of the waveguide .",
    "this gives rise to the formation of waveguide modes .",

    "the process of parallel parametric amplification or parallel pumping can be realized by the interaction of a microwave pumping field @xmath39 , which is applied along the static magnetization , with the longitudinal component of the dynamic magnetization in a magnetic material . in an in - plane magnetized magnetic thin film ,",

    "this is a unique feature of microstructured elements and a major difference to the previously studied macroscopic samples ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . since this mode is the most interesting mode for magnonics as it features the largest net magnetic moment and the largest group velocity among all waveguide modes ( compare slopes of dispersion in fig .",

    "another very important feature can be seen from eq .",
    "[ eq : w+ ] : the energy flux into the mode @xmath14 is proportional to its density @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the mode @xmath14 needs to be initially populated in order to be amplified . at room temperature ,",
    "this initial population is generally provided by a homogeneous thermal excitation of practically all spin - wave modes @xmath14 in the investigated frequency range , since @xmath106 .",
    "alternatively , a ( in general significantly larger ) population of spin waves at a desired frequency can be realized by an external excitation with driving frequency @xmath107 .    as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : theo - pamp1 ]  ( b ) , due to the negligible linear momentum of the microwave photons @xmath108 , parallel pumping a priori leads to the formation of counter - propagating waves with @xmath109 in order to fulfill momentum conservation . in the context of parametric amplification of",
    "externally excited , signal carrying waves , these two waves are commonly referred to as the signal ( @xmath110 ) and idler ( @xmath111 ) wave , which share a mutual phase relation according to eq .",
    "[ eq : phaserel ] . hereby , the signal wave is the wave running in parallel to the input waves whereas the idler wave runs in the opposite direction .",
    "this process is commonly referred to as the adiabatic regime of parallel pumping . however , by providing a spatial confinement to the pumping field , it is possible to obtain a pumping source with an effective wavevector spectrum @xmath112 .",
    "in this so called nonadiabatic regime of parallel pumping@xcite , the finite momentum provided by the localization allows for a splitting of microwave photons with @xmath113 into pairs of co - propagating waves following @xmath114      several mechanisms can limit the amplitude of the amplified spin waves .",
    "the most important ones are the dephasing mechanism which has been originally introduced by zhakarov , lvov and starobinets and the nonlinear damping of the generated waves .",
    "in particular , the dephasing mechanism has proven to be responsible for most observations made in the material yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) , where the phenomenon of parallel pumping was extensively studied in bulk and thin - film samples ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the dephasing mechanism is already incorporated into eqs .",
    "[ eq : s - n]-[eq : s - nl ] and it is based on the fact that the generated waves provide a mutual pumping field by themselves , named the internal pumping can deviate from @xmath115 ( cf .",
    ".  [ eq : s - psi ] ) . ] . in a simple picture ,",
    "if a certain population @xmath105 is already established , a new magnon pair @xmath52 which is supposed to be generated feels the influence of the external pumping field as well as the one of the internal pumping field , which is proportional to @xmath100 . due to the fact that the phase of the already generated wave - pairs differs from the phase of the external pumping initially by @xmath102 , the newly generated magnons now have to adjust their phase to the phase of the effective pumping field . by doing so , the energy flux @xmath93 from the pumping field into the magnon group decreases until , at some point , at a pumping field above the threshold field @xmath44 , @xmath93 matches the flux @xmath94 and the spin - wave density @xmath105 saturates .    a numerical demonstration of the influence of this process under the assumption of the presence of two modes @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "can , for example , be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular , these works address the coexistence of two modes in the system of which one is the signal mode @xmath116 and the other one is the dominant mode @xmath117 . here",
    ", the dominant mode is supposed to be the thermally excited exchange wave featuring the lowest instability threshold while the signal mode is excited initially at a much larger level , i.e. , @xmath118 . in return",
    ", it features a larger damping @xmath119 .",
    "if now a pumping field , which is sufficiently large to exceed the threshold of the signal mode , is applied , the signal group is initially favored due to its higher starting population . however , after a certain period , the dominant mode will end up with a larger population due to its larger intensity increment @xmath120 per unit time ( cf .",
    "[ eq : thresh1 ] ) .",
    "once the amplitudes of the two waves have increased beyond a certain critical level , the dephasing mechanism limits the magnon density in the steady state .",
    "in particular , in the steady state the internal pumping field has decreased the total pumping field to the point where @xmath121 , where the last inequality is based on the fact of the dominant group is largest and/or @xmath94 is smallest , since it features the lowest @xmath43 and/or the largest @xmath89 . ] that @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the losses of the signal group are smaller than the inserted energy and it will start to decay in time .",
    "hence , on the long run , only the dominant mode survives in the steady state , which is a general feature of this mode that also holds if more than two modes are investigated .",
    "this concept puts important restrictions on the amplification of traveling spin waves by the mechanism of parametric amplification , especially if the signal mode is not the dominant mode .",
    "the second important limiting mechanism of the spin - wave amplitude is the nonlinear damping of the spin waves themselves , i.e. , a change of the spin - wave relaxation frequency @xmath43 due to magnon - magnon interaction .",
    "this can be included by an additional term @xmath122 in the rate equations@xcite .",
    "while in most experiments performed in bulk materials and thin films this is only a side effect which appears at a rather large supercriticality @xmath123 , the nonlinear damping can play a more decisive role in microstructures such as transversely magnetized waveguides .",
    "in particular , this can be the case because , depending on the geometry , the waveguide modes in these waveguides can exhibit very similar relaxation frequencies @xmath43 and coupling parameters @xmath50 and , thus , feature a very similar threshold ( cf .",
    "[ fig : theo - pamp2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the usual assumption that only one spin - wave mode is excited by the parametric amplification is not valid anymore . even at very low supercriticalities a whole set of waveguide modes",
    "is potentially amplified . before the aforementioned saturation due to the phase - mechanism sets in , where only the dominant mode is maintained by the action of the pumping field",
    ", this increases the amplitude of all of these modes . for a four - magnon process , the coupling between the involved modes is proportional to the product of their amplitudes ( cf .",
    ", for example , @xcite ) and the threshold for such processes is inversely proportional to the spin - wave damping .",
    "thus , the fact that the damping of several modes @xmath124 , @xmath125 , ... is compensated by the pumping field also increases the nonlinear damping of each of these modes due to the four - magnon interaction with all other modes which are excited in this transition phase .",
    "consequently , it is expected that nonlinear damping can also have a significant influence on the amplitude limitation in microstructures .",
    "it should be noted that both of these limitation mechanisms imply that the intensity level at which the parametrically amplified spin waves saturate depends on the supercriticality .",
    "the higher the applied pumping power above the threshold , the higher the saturation level which can be maintained in the steady state under the act of parallel pumping .",
    "thus , to achieve a large spin - wave density of the amplified waves , a large supercriticality is generally favorable .      as mentioned above",
    ", the fact that in the investigated waveguides generally more than one mode is excited for very small supercriticalities already limits the simple application of the @xmath38-theory described above .",
    "moreover , the @xmath38-theory has been derived explicitly for spatially homogeneous samples and pumping fields .",
    "therefore , it can not take into account the finite sizes of the analyzed waveguides or the resulting lateral quantization effects .",
    "the prediction of the thresholds , however , is expected to be correct since it comes from the very general energy balance which can - at least via the spin - wave dispersion - account for the effects arising from the quantization .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite that the general hamilton approach sketched above can describe the thresholds and the critical modes for spin - wave instabilities in waveguides reasonably well . since the treatment of the parallel - pumping instability is very similar to the treatment of these spin - wave interactions , one can expect that the prediction of the thresholds is valid . still , the predictions of the @xmath38-theory for the steady state and the limitation mechanisms have to be considered rather as a tool for a qualitative understanding of the occurring phenomena .",
    "an additional side effect of the quantization should be noted at this point : only a limited number of modes exists at a given frequency @xmath70 as a consequence of the lateral quantization and due to the low film thicknesses .",
    "thus , it is possible to realize the case in which the fundamental waveguide mode constitutes the dominant mode as well as the signal mode .",
    "as mentioned above , this is hardly ever the case in macroscopic samples . in these samples",
    "typically some exchange mode features the lowest threshold@xcite .",
    "thus , after a certain time , this mode diminishes the intensity of the signal wave and suppresses the information stored in this mode . in microstructures",
    ", this implies that , at least according to the phase mechanism , the steady - state can be reached for the signal waves and the information carried by these waves can , this way , be stored in the spin - wave system by the pumping field .",
    "parametric generation is referred to as the amplification of thermal spin waves@xcite .",
    "spin waves are always thermally excited at room temperature due to their @xmath0 excitation energy .",
    "the pumping field couples to the longitudinal dynamic component provided by these thermal waves and , if the instability threshold is overcome , they can be amplified . due to the fact that the parallel pumping process always allows for the creation of counter - propagating waves with a vanishing sum of wavevectors , this gives access to the excitation of spin waves with large wavevectors ,",
    "even with spatially extended pumping sources@xcite . this way , parametric generation has enabled the excitation of short - wavelength spin waves in macroscopic systems , an important prerequisite for the observation of , for instance , the bose einstein condensation of magnons@xcite .",
    "moreover , unlike conventional antennae@xcite , it is not primarily sensitive to the net magnetic moment of the excited modes and , thus , their symmetry .",
    "in contrast , the wavevector dependence of the threshold fields is mainly determined by the above mentioned characteristics and , thus , a function of the ellipticity of the mode pairs and their relaxation frequency@xcite .",
    "hence , parametric generation is a powerful tool to study the mode spectra in magnetic systems . due to the fact that on the long run the amplification of the dominant mode suppresses all other modes , a knowledge of the dominant mode spectrum of the investigated structures is mandatory in order to design the optimum amplification of externally excited spin waves . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the dominant mode spectra in the most commonly studied geometries in microstructures , namely in microscopic elliptical elements and longitudinally as well as transversely magnetized spin - wave waveguides .",
    "we will show that in all these systems a favored generation of the fundamental mode can be achieved .",
    "microstructured elliptical elements are widely used as basic elements in prototypes of magnetic random access memories@xcite and spin - transfer torque driven magnetic nano - oscillators@xcite .",

    "as mentioned above , this is mediated by the fact that the amplified wave - front needs a certain time until it reaches the intensity level needed for detection .",
    "due to the fact that the supercriticality is weak , the incremental change of the spin - wave intensity per unit time is small ( cf .",

    "[ fig : pamp - glob2 ]  ( b ) and ( c ) , it becomes evident that - if a single pumping pulse is used for the spin - wave amplification - a trade - off between a long propagation range and a high effective signal velocity of the amplified waves has to be made .",

    "the only difference in the temporal dynamics of these two spin waves is that the amplified spin - wave packet is detected at an earlier time because it starts with a larger starting amplitude than the thermal waves .",

    "[ fig : pamp - glob3 ]  ( b ) is used , the parametric amplifier can be operated with a comparably large pumping power , resulting in a fast effective signal propagation as well as a large peak spin - wave intensity and , at the same time , it can operate with a very low noise .",
    "if the amplification pulses are short enough to avoid that the intensity of the parametrically generated waves always stays well below the initial level of the signal spin waves and if they are applied with a repetition that ensures that the externally excited , amplified packet always recovers to its initial amplitude during the amplification , a loss - less propagation without a notable creation of parametrically generated noise can be realized . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pamp - glob3 ]  ( b ) , where the rise and fall times of the experiment in ni@xmath3fe@xmath4 have been assumed , this scheme would require a high repetition rate of the pumping pulses .",

    "if the amplifier is not extending along the entire magnetic structure but is still large in comparison to the spin - wave wavelength , the output of the amplifier in the forward direction is , however , not affected by the relative phase between signal spin waves and pumping field .",
    "hence , it is impossible to obtain a phase information which is not sensitive to the readout position or to pass on only spin waves with a desired phase within a magnonic network . in turn , this can be achieved by making the amplifier smaller than the wavelength of the spin waves which are to be amplified . in this",

    "the orange curve is a theoretical prediction of the frequency non - reciprocity based on ref .",
    "@xcite assuming nonidentical surface constants of @xmath282 and @xmath283 , values which are in the expected parameter range @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the model provides a reasonable description for wavevectors larger than @xmath284 , whereas there is a significant deviation for smaller wavevectors .",
    "thus , the region at very small wavevectors , which is not accessible to conventional bls measurements , indicates that a more involved theoretical model is necessary to explain all the ( nonreciprocal ) features of the spin - wave dispersion in such layer systems .",
    "another origin of frequency non - reciprocities which are an odd function of the spin - wave wavevector is the interfacial dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( idmi)@xcite , which can arise in thin magnetic films in a layer system featuring a structural inversion asymmetry ( sia)@xcite . the idmi has recently attracted a large research interest due to its intriguing consequences such as , among others , the stabilization of magnetic skyrmions@xcite , its impact on the domain wall dynamics @xcite or the deterministic magnetization switching driven by spin orbit torques@xcite .",
    "conventional measurements of the idmi - strength in ultra - thin films are either performed by analyzing the domain - wall expansion@xcite or by analyzing the non - reciprocal spin - wave dispersion by conventional , wavevector resolved brillouin light scattering spectroscopy in extended films@xcite .",
    "more recently , also an electrical characterization of the idmi in an individual microstructure has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite using similar means as have been used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the characterization of influence of unequal surface anisotropies .",
    "while the analysis of the domain - wall - motion in the presence of idmi can be rather involved , the bls measurements suffer from the rather small frequency resolution of the bls of a few @xmath285 , which , as mentioned above , hampers the determination of the idmi - constant ( or anisotropy - differences ) for small wavevectors or for very small idmi - strengths .",
    "moreover , since micro - focused bls comes along with a loss of wavevector resolution , this method can not be used to probe individual micro- or nanostructures unless phase - resolved bls is applied or spin - wave interference is studied .",
    "the demonstrated electrical detection schemes can be applied to individual microstructures . however , the demonstration in ref .",
    "@xcite has been carried out on pt / co / mgo , a system that features a very high dmi constant , and the method is already at the detection limit in this system .",
    "since the impact of the idmi on the spin - wave dispersion scales with the inverse of the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer , its determination is best performed in very thin films , which also helps to reduce the influence of the likely unequal surface anisotropies in the presence of sia .",
    "due to the large induced damping caused by the contact to the heavy metals in common systems featuring idmi such as co / pt , ni@xmath3fe@xmath4/pt or cofeb / pt and the low group velocity in very thin films , propagating spin - wave spectroscopy becomes a challenging task . here ,",
    "the presented method to use the interference pattern created by the parametric amplification of traveling waves offers a good alternative : it can detect very tiny shifts and it is not limited by the small propagation range .",
    "thus , together with the determination of the spin - wave dispersion using short microwave pulses to determine the spin - wave wavevector from the spatial interference pattern , it constitutes a valuable alternative method for the characterization of idmi in individual microstructures .      besides the amplification of traveling waves ,",
    "parallel parametric amplification has also been applied to spin - transfer torque driven nano - oscillators ( stno)@xcite to study the underlying physical phenomena and to improve their output characteristics . in an stno ,",
    "the magnetization of an active layer , typically referred to as the free layer , is subjected to an incident spin current .",
    "this spin current can be provided , for instance , by a direct current in a magnetoresistive device such as a spin valve or a magnetic tunneling junction@xcite or by the inverse spin hall effect in an adjacent heavy - metal layer@xcite . despite the various differences in geometry ,",
    "magnetization configuration and material systems , all stnos are based on the common principle that the incident spin current results in a spin transfer torque ( stt)@xcite acting on the magnetization of the free layer which counteracts the damping . similar to the impact of parametric amplification , this leads to a growth of the oscillation amplitude of the stno if the inserted energy per unit time exceeds the loss rate of the stt - driven mode .",
    "spin - wave amplification by stt is , thus , also a threshold process .",
    "this mechanism allows for the generation of an rf current by the conversion of a dc current .",
    "it should , however , be noted that it is hardly possible to select the fundamental mode to be the dominant mode amplified by stt in a spin - wave waveguide .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to implement it as a means of spin - wave amplification in extended systems such as spin - wave waveguides@xcite .",
    "in contrast , it was demonstrated that it can constitute an efficient means to excite standing waves in a highly - quantized geometry in stnos .",
    "the manifold of device geometries for stnos leads to a large span of frequencies which can be covered by such rf sources .",
    "this renders stnos highly attractive for device applications , such as rf communications , where miniaturized rf sources with a large tunability are needed .",
    "however , due to the lack of a frequency - selectivity , the dc stt interacts with the entire spin - wave spectrum . from a fundamental point of view",
    "this gives rise to many interesting nonlinear phenomena and creates a large playground to study non - linear spin - wave dynamics .",
    "for a device application , however , this hampers the functionality of the stnos , since the interaction of the stt with the entire spin - wave spectrum leads to an undesired increase of the noise present in the oscillator . the resulting spin - wave  spin - wave interaction can result in a loss of phase - stability and increases the linewidth of the oscillator .",
    "thus , typically stnos are systems where the spin waves are strongly quantized and the spin - wave spectrum should be as simple and diluted as possible to ensure good device properties . since this is not always easy to achieve , many stnos suffer from a rather large linewidth .",
    "in addition , the output power of individual stnos is too low for most practical applications .",
    "one proposed way to overcome these issues is the synchronization of an array of oscillators .",
    "such an array with oscillators working in parallel can produce a large output power where the mutual phase - locking of the oscillators provides the necessary phase - stability and reduces the linewidth@xcite .",
    "first experimental evidence of phase - locked pairs of point contacts@xcite has been followed by the demonstration of the synchronization of up to 5 oscillators@xcite . however , the creation of large synchronized arrays is a challenging task .",
    "this is , for instance , due to the limited reproducibility of the exact device shape , resulting in a frequency detuning between individual devices , and the large joule heating created in an array@xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the limited spin - wave propagation range , only oscillators situated close - by can be directly synchronized via spin - wave beams . in order to analyze the full potential and the limitations of phase - locking experimentally , as well as to explore the optimum operation conditions , large efforts have also been devoted to study the interaction of an stno with an external locking - source , such as a microwave generator . among these experiments ,",
    "the parametric interaction of oscillators with a microwave current at twice their free - running auto - oscillation frequency has proven a vital technique , since it allows to decouple the driving frequency from the detected fundamental frequency of the oscillator . as will be briefly discussed in the following , these experiments have , among others , allowed to study the influence of noise and the applied pumping power on the locking bandwidth , have enabled an alternative quantification of the effect of the stt on the damping by analyzing its influence on the parametric instability threshold , and have proven that the coupling to an external pumping field can compensate the frequency mismatch of different oscillators in the locked state .",

    "its selectivity makes parallel pumping a superior method for the amplification of traveling waves , since the energy from the pumping field is not distributed over the entire spin - wave spectrum",

    "this approach is limited in scalability and requires quite large microwave fields . on the one hand , since the absorption of the individual structures is low and the applied microwave field can interact with a large number of structures , the field can be used as a global reference phase on the chip and it can be implemented as an active part in the logic circuits - benefiting in particular from the development of new materials with large saturation magnetization ( i.e. , large coupling ) and low damping . nevertheless , the interplay with individual nanostructures will require alternative approaches to create the pumping field in a local and energy - efficient way .",
    "since any interaction which alters the effective field in parallel to the alignment of the static magnetization can be used , there are , however , plenty of options to achieve this .",

    ", the journey will be a rewarding one : a decay - free propagation of spin waves in extended magnonic circuits becomes possible by parallel parametric amplification .",

    "<S> magnonics and magnon spintronics aim at the utilization of spin waves and magnons , their quanta , for the construction of wave - based logic networks via the generation of pure all - magnon spin currents and their interfacing with electrical charge transport . the promise of efficient parallel data processing and low power consumption renders this field one of the most promising research areas in spintronics . in this context , the process of parallel parametric amplification , i.e. , the conversion of microwave photons into magnons at one half of the microwave frequency , has proven to be a versatile tool to excite and to manipulate spin waves . </S>",
    "<S> its beneficial and unique properties such as frequency and mode - selectivity , the possibility to excite spin waves in a wide wavevector range and the creation of phase - correlated wave pairs , have enabled the achievement of important milestones like the magnon bose einstein condensation and the cloning and trapping of spin - wave packets . </S>",
    "<S> parallel parametric amplification , which allows for the selective amplification of magnons while conserving their phase is , thus , one of the key methods of spin - wave generation and amplification .    </S>",
    "<S> the application of parallel parametric amplification to cmos - compatible micro- and nanostructures is an important step towards the realization of magnonic networks . </S>",
    "<S> this is motivated not only by the fact that amplifiers are an important tool for the construction of any extended logic network but also by the unique properties of parallel parametric amplification . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the creation of phase - correlated wave pairs allows for rewarding alternative logic operations such as a phase - dependent amplification of the incident waves . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the successful application of parallel parametric amplification to metallic microstructures has been reported which constitutes an important milestone for the application of magnonics in practical devices . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated that parametric amplification provides an excellent tool to generate and to amplify spin waves in these systems in a wide wavevector range . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the amplification greatly benefits from the discreteness of the spin - wave spectra since the size of the microstructures is comparable to the spin - wave wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up new , interesting routes of spin - wave amplification and manipulation . in this review </S>",
    "<S> , we will give an overview over the recent developments and achievements in this field .    </S>",
