    "the lorentz gas , originally introduced by lorentz @xcite in 1905 to model the motion of electrons in a metal , describes an ensemble of non - interacting point particles in an infinite array of spherical scatterers .",

    "the first step towards the proof of the existence of a limiting process for the periodic lorentz gas is the understanding of the distribution of the free path length in the limit @xmath2 , which is the key result of the present paper .",
    "the distribution of the free path lengths in the periodic lorentz gas was already investigated by polya , who rephrased the problem in terms of the visibility in a ( periodic ) forest @xcite .",

    "it is not hard to see that this sequence ( or rather : this sequence of sequences ) is uniformly distributed mod 1 , i.e. , for every @xmath51 , @xmath52 this ( classical ) equidistribution statement follows from the fact that the asymptotic number of lattice points in a fixed sector of a large disc is proportional to the volume of the sector .    a popular way to characterize the `` randomness '' of a uniformly distributed sequence is the statistics of gaps .",
