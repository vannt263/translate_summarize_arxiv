    "current efforts in observational cosmology are directed towards characterizing the energy content of the universe .",
    "the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe inferred from the hubble diagram for sn type ia @xcite combined with constraints from cosmic microwave background radiation from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite , from cosmic shear observations @xcite , cluster baryon fractions @xcite , galaxy surveys @xcite suggests that @xmath0 per cent of the energy in the universe is in the form of dark energy .",
    "dark energy is best described by the equation of state that relates its pressure , @xmath1 , to its energy density , @xmath2 , via @xmath3 , with @xmath4 corresponding to the case of the cosmological constant .",
    "massive foreground clusters often produce many sets of highly distorted arcs and multiple images of background galaxies @xcite .",
    "the lensing effect is determined by the mass distribution , the precise configuration of the lens and source with respect to the observer , and the angular diameter distances between the lens , source and observer .",
    "when at least two sources at distinct redshift are strongly lensed in a cluster , the relative positions of the arcs depend on the ratios of angular diameter distances . in principle therefore , cosmological parameters can be constrained from the lensing configuration .",
    "constraining the geometry and matter content of the universe using multiple sets of arcs in cluster lenses has been explored by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite has suggested using multiple images produced by galaxy lenses instead of clusters and attempted an application to the case of the lensing system hst14176 + 5226 .",
    "@xcite showed that the cosmological sensitivity of the angular size - redshift relation could be exploited using sources at distinct redshifts and developed a methodology to simultaneously invert the lens and derive cosmological constraints .",
    "@xcite applied the technique to the cluster cl0024 + 1654 and found support for an accelerating universe .",
    "@xcite showed that the recovery of cosmological parameters was feasible with 3 sets of multiple images for a single simulated cluster .",
    "@xcite then applied the technique to the lensing cluster abell 2218 and using 4 multiple image systems at distinct redshifts , find @xmath5 and @xmath6 assuming a flat universe .",
    "recently , a double einstein ring has been discovered and applied to cosmography @xcite . as the system has only two sources ,",
    "only weak cosmography constraints were obtained .",
    "there have been several studies that have explored the cross - sections of multiple image formation using simulated clusters from cosmological _",
    "n_-body simulations .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied the efficiency of numerical clusters to produce multiple images in different dark energy models .",
    "they found the expected abundance of arcs with a given length - to - width ratio and the lensing cross - sections depend on the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "these statistical studies of multiple image formation concluded that strong lensing offers a plausible method to discriminate amongst various dark energy models .",
    "in this paper we study two basic aspects of the non - statistical approach to cosmography with cluster strong lensing ( csl ) , which have yet to be addressed .",
    "these are : 1 ) how many clusters must be individually marginalized , with the resulting @xmath7 from each cluster added together to form a final @xmath7 for cosmology recovery ( i.e. stacked ) , in the ideal case to obtain cosmological constraints comparable with other methods and 2 ) the required accuracy of the observational parameters , i.e. the source redshift and image positions . by studying these two aspects separately from the subtleties involved with cluster mass distribution reconstruction , we can make definitive statements on the type of cluster surveys required for a first application of csl .",
    "we do not model the lensing effects induced by the distribution of substructure along the line of sight .",
    "this additional complication has been examined in earlier work by @xcite and @xcite , who both used ray tracing methods through @xmath8-body simulations . simulating a representative shell of the universe centered at @xmath9",
    ", @xcite found that approximately 10%-15% of the lensing mass was to be found in substructure along the line of sight , for about one third of lensing configurations with a source redshift above @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , it was shown that substructure along the line of sight is limited to a finite number of lens planes , typically one or two additional planes , when line of sight substructure played a significant role in lensing .",
    "they have shown explicitly that @xmath11 of the contribution to the convergence arises from secondary lens planes . for cluster",
    "strong lensing the critical factor is not the error induced in the convergence but rather the perturbations caused in the positions of the multiple images due to the presence of matter in additional lens planes .",
    "a detailed and exhaustive set of cosmological simulations that will enable the matter distribution of a typical line of sight to be averaged over many representative lines of sight is needed to accurately quantify this effect . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that systematic errors in the cosmology recovery could result , if the line of sight substructure was not taken into account .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we begin with an introduction to the basics of strong lensing and dark energy in section  2 .",
    "then in section  3 we discuss image families , and define the cosmological family ratio , which csl constrains . the methodology used to generate smooth simulated clusters",
    "is described in section  4 and section  5 , along with the @xmath7 minimization scheme used in the cosmology recovery .",
    "we present the results of recovering the input cosmology in section  6 , and study the dependence of the recovery on lens parameters in section  7 .",
    "we then study the allowed errors in the source redshift and image positions in section  8 .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the simplifying assumptions made in this work in section  9 .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our technique , and the implications for future survey strategies .",
    "the gravitational lens equation is a mapping from the source plane at redshift @xmath12 to the image plane ( or lens plane ) at redshift @xmath13 and is given by , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the angular position of the image , @xmath16 is the unobserved source position , @xmath17 is the deflection angle which depends on @xmath18 the reduced angular diameter distance , @xmath19 the mass distribution of the lens and @xmath15 . the cosmological dependence is contained in @xmath18 , which we call the reduced angular diameter defined by : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angular diameter distance between redshift @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the observer - lens , lens - source and observer - source angular diameter distances respectively . in a flat homogeneous friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology",
    "the angular diameter distance is given by , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the speed of light ; @xmath29 is the present day value of the hubble constant , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the fractional contributions of the total matter and dark energy respectively , in units of the critical density and @xmath32 is the dark energy equation of state .",
    "note that we do not consider evolving dark energy models in our simulations , since there is currently no observational evidence for such a time evolution in the dark energy equation of state @xcite .    to further explore the dependence of the lens equation on cosmological parameters",
    ", we note that the deflection angle can be written in terms of the gradient of the reduced gravitational potential @xmath33 : @xmath34 .",
    "the reduced gravitational potential can be related to the projected surface mass density along the line of sight , @xmath35 , through the poisson equation , where the projected gravitational potential @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37 in the thin lens approximation the projected gravitational potential is a solution of : @xmath38 .",
    "the total deflection @xmath39 is therefore determined both by the cosmological parameters ( via @xmath40 ) and the projected surface mass density of the intervening lens . for a given configuration of the source , lens and observer ,",
    "the critical value of the surface mass density is : @xmath41 the region where the projected surface mass density of a lens exceeds this critical value defines the strong lensing regime .",
    "background sources that are aligned behind this region are likely to be multiply imaged , magnified and distorted .",
    "there are hence two fundamental equations which define the gravitational lensing dependence on the angular diameter distances @xmath42 .",
    "the first is the lens mapping , equation  ( [ lensequation ] ) , which defines the configuration of the images produced by a lensing cluster , and the second is equation  ( [ eqn : sigmacrit ] ) which defines the strong lensing regime .",
    "the cosmological dependence of strong lensing is discussed further in section  [ sec : cosmofamilyratio ] .",
    "consider a lensing configuration where at least two sources have been strongly lensed by a cluster .",
    "once the multiple images of each source have been identified , we can write the source and the associated image positions with a family index @xmath43 .",
    "the lens equation is then , @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the position of the @xmath46 image of family @xmath43 . when there are @xmath47 multiple images detected in family @xmath43 , we can sum over all the images in equation  ( [ lenseqintrofinot ] ) .",
    "substituting into equation  ( [ projgravpot ] ) for the reduced gravitational potential allows the summed equation to be written in terms of the line of sight projected gravitational potential as follows : @xmath48 note that equation  ( [ lenscos1 ] ) is a non - linear function of the image positions , since the sum of the image positions depends on the projected cluster potential gradient .    given a set of input cosmological parameters , the lens redshift and a source redshift for a single family of images , i.e. @xmath49 , the angular diameter distance ratio is specified and constant .",
    "the cluster potential is conventionally normalized by the square of the velocity dispersion , which we denote by @xmath50 . in equation  ( [ lenscos1 ] )",
    "the reduced angular diameter distance @xmath18 and the cluster mass normalization @xmath51 are degenerate when recovering cosmological parameters .",
    "_ therefore , cosmological parameters can not be disentangled from the cluster mass normalization with only one family of multiple images . _",
    "possible solutions to remove this degeneracy are considered by @xcite .",
    "they show an additional prior on the mass profile is required and this must come from observations independent of strong lensing . for parametric models ,",
    "this is typically a total mass determination from the detected x - ray emission of the cluster .",
    "now consider the case when two strongly lensed sources are observed as multiple image families in the same cluster lens at two redshifts .",
    "let family 1 have a total of @xmath52 observed images and family 2 have @xmath53 observed images .",
    "we require that at least two images from each are observed , i.e. @xmath54 . taking the ratio of family 1 to family 2 ( equation [ [ lenscos1 ] ] ) we obtain , @xmath55 note that we now have a ratio of two factors of @xmath56 .",
    "this clearly means that the degeneracy between the cosmological parameters and the cluster potential normalization is broken when 2 families of multiple images are observed in a cluster lens .    in equation  ( [ lenscos2 ] ) , the term in braces is a function of the angular diameter distances only .",
    "this quantity is fundamental to the determination of cosmological parameters through csl and we define this term as the family ratio and denote it by @xmath57 : @xmath58 where @xmath13 is the lens redshift , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the two source redshifts , and @xmath61 is the angular diameter distance defined in equation  ( [ angulardiameter ] ) .",
    "the cosmological family ratio can be written in terms of the reduced angular diameter distance , @xmath62 , where the subscripts 1 and 2 here denote the family index .",
    "we plot @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ fig : familyratio ] for a fixed lens redshift of @xmath63 and differing source redshifts . since the non - evolving dark energy component with @xmath64",
    "can also be interpreted as the cosmological constant @xmath65 , we plot the contours of the cosmological family ratio in both the @xmath66-@xmath65 plane in addition to the @xmath66-@xmath32 plane .",
    "note that the contours in the @xmath66-@xmath65 plane are not as sensitive to the lens - source configuration as they are in the @xmath66-@xmath32 plane .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the cosmological family ratio , @xmath57 , depends on the source redshifts and the lens redshift ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : familyratio ] ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that the distribution of sources in magnitude and redshift as well as the cluster redshift distribution are key inputs in our simulations .",
    "therefore we base our simulations of strong lensing clusters on high resolution observational data from _ hst _ images .",
    "we note that although the cluster normalization is irrelevant to our method for constraining the cosmological parameters , we still construct this quantity rigorously .",
    "this ensures the simulations produce lensing clusters with cross - sections similar to those of observed clusters .      in order to simulate the lensed images",
    "produced by a massive cluster , it is necessary to characterize the number density , @xmath8 , of the sources behind the lens .",
    "we consider background point sources for which the number density is a function of magnitude and redshift , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , space - based positional accuracy is assumed throughout this paper . we must therefore draw redshifts and magnitudes from a space - based source distribution .",
    "the hubble deep field ( hdf ) @xcite and hdf - south ( hdf - s ) wfpc2 @xcite are the ideal data sets to derive the source distribution .",
    "it is also possible to use the recent cosmos data to derive the redshift and magnitude source distributions , see @xcite .",
    "in particular we have checked that our source redshift distribution , which is derived below , is equivalent to that of @xcite .",
    "we employ the wfpc2 hdf and hdf - s photometric redshift catalogues derived by the stony brook collaboration @xcite and characterize the hdf sources by a distribution function .",
    "this method is chosen since we wish to analyse an ensemble of clusters , where each cluster lenses a unique source configuration . characterizing the source distribution by a function",
    "is preferable in our case , since we do not want to bias the results by lensing large scale structures such as voids or filaments .",
    "note that there is evidence of a weak cluster in the hdf @xcite .    to model the source distribution from the hdf and hdf - s data ,",
    "we first make two cuts to the catalogues .",
    "initially , we drop all objects with magnitudes greater than @xmath68 .",
    "next we select objects in the redshift interval @xmath69 .",
    "the lower bound is chosen because the lensing efficiency is negligible for low source redshifts .",
    "the upper redshift bound is chosen because the photometric redshift determination is unreliable for @xmath70 and most observed multiply imaged sources behind massive clusters have redshift @xmath71 .",
    "this yields @xmath72 objects when the catalogues are merged .",
    "the corresponding projected source number density is @xmath73arcmin@xmath74 for the ensemble catalogue .",
    "we now bin the merged catalogue in magnitude from @xmath75 in intervals of @xmath76 and in redshift from @xmath77 in intervals of @xmath78 .",
    "these data are then fit with functions of the form , @xmath79\\,\\exp[-\\,c\\,(z - d)^{t } ] \\\\    & & \\times\\exp[-\\,g\\,(m - b)^{u}(z - d)^{v}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the exponents in the exponential terms , @xmath80 , can take an even integer value .",
    "the constants @xmath81 and @xmath43 are determined in the fitting procedure .",
    "we simply use the lowest @xmath7 fit to construct a probability distribution function in the simulations .",
    "this is @xmath82 , with the other parameters given by : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "notably , the @xmath7 of the above fit is approximately one half of the @xmath7 that is obtained when the binned magnitude and redshift data are decoupled and fitted on an individual basis , i.e. @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it is therefore clear that to avoid a systematic bias in the source generation , a joint fit in magnitude and redshift space is required .",
    "deep acs imaging of abell 1689 has allowed identification of more than 30 families of multiply images systems @xcite .",
    "it is clear that abell 1689 is the ideal candidate to compare with our source distribution .",
    "we base our analysis on @xcite , however our conclusions are unchanged if we use the analysis of @xcite . with the lens model as a guide",
    "@xcite have identified multiple images to @xmath91 .",
    "this means images with magnitudes comparable to and less than the magnitude limit of our hdf catalogues , @xmath92 , are detected in the acs observations .",
    "this means we can compare our source distribution to the properties of abell 1689 directly .    in order to compare the source characteristics of abell 1689 with our source distribution ,",
    "we need to lens this distribution through a mass model . @xcite",
    "have published an navarro , frenk , & white ( nfw ) fit ( see section  [ sec : nfw ] ) to approximate the true mass profile . using a radially averaged ( and therefore circular ) mass profile",
    ", they provide the tangential and radial critical curves , computed at redshift @xmath93 .",
    "they also determine the nfw scale radius @xmath94kpc and we adopt @xmath95kpc .",
    "we then adjust an nfw fit until the two critical curve locations are reproduced .",
    "since we are using a smooth profile , the properties of abell 1689 we compare our source distribution with can not depend on the small scale details of the mass distribution .",
    "there are two quantities which satisfy this requirement : 1 ) the total number of lensed sources and 2 ) their redshift distribution",
    ". a test of the hdf constructed source distribution would be the ability to reproduce these two quantities for simulated lenses similar to abell 1689 .",
    "note that we do expect some systematic effects due to the lack of assumed substructure in the modeling .",
    "in particular , the fact that abell 1689 is non - circular , and is known to have images which are influenced by substructure , means any comparison between the actual data and our model ( which is circular , and has no structure ) will exhibit residuals .    to compare our simulations with the abell 1689 sources , we take @xmath96 as the source redshift for each image from table  2 of @xcite . also , because the hdf catalogues used to derive the source distribution",
    "have been cut at @xmath97 , we drop all sources with redshift @xmath98 .",
    "the abell 1689 source redshifts are then binned in intervals of @xmath99 from @xmath100 to @xmath97 . for proper comparison with the simulations",
    ", the bin counts are normalized by the total number of families in abell 1689 .",
    "we simulate the smooth abell 1689 nfw profile for 500 source configurations generated with our source distribution .",
    "we then lens the sources independently for each configuration , using the procedure explained in section  [ sec : clusterandimage ] .",
    "multiply imaged sources are identified and binned identically as the abell 1689 sources .",
    "the average number of multiply imaged sources in the 500 simulations is @xmath101 per simulation .",
    "the minimum and maximum number of families are 7 and 28 respectively and of the 500 configurations 102 exhibit 20 or more families of images .",
    "to @xmath97 there are 27 families in the @xcite analysis .",
    "although the mean number for our generated images is lower than that of the 27 strongly lensed sources in abell 1689 by @xmath102 , we do not consider this a serious problem .",
    "the total number of strongly lensed sources is within factor of 2 in 69 per cent of the 500 realizations .",
    "we now examine the redshift distribution of the lensed sources in the simulations .",
    "the configurations are combined to produce a distribution of redshift probabilities in each bin .",
    "this allows the mean and standard deviation to be computed , see fig .",
    "[ figabell ] .",
    "our simulated redshift distribution lies within 1@xmath103 of the abell 1689 sources , except for the @xmath104 bin for which there are no observed multiply imaged sources in abell 1689",
    ".    finally we discuss the image properties themselves .",
    "since the mass model does not include substructure , we do not expect to reproduce the source multiplicity distribution or the image magnitude distribution of abell 1689 accurately . for a circular nfw mass profile , lensed sources with multiplicity of at most 3",
    "can only be produced , whereas higher multiplicities are observed in abell 1689 .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figabell ] , the image magnitude distribution as generated through our source distribution does match that of abell 1689 , and the overall shape is reproduced .",
    "both 1 ) the total number , and the 2 ) redshift distribution of the simulated sources are consistent with the source characteristics of abell 1689 . given the results of this comparison , we conclude that the hdf derived source population distribution is a faithful representation of the actual source distribution behind massive lensing clusters .      in order to generate a set of massive , strong lensing clusters in our simulations , we need to derive redshifts from an observed cluster redshift distribution .",
    "to do so , we use the massive cluster survey ( macs ) @xcite sample as our template .",

    "this bound restricts the simulations to massive clusters that plausibly exhibit image configurations that are measurable with the hrc .",

    "first we consider the case where one has complete knowledge of the gravitational lens , i.e. all lens parameters are known exactly .",
    "the result of the marginalization with all lens parameters fixed is shown in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nfwarray ] for the nfw lensing cluster .",
    "note that the confidence region for the nfw profile is non - zero .",
    "in fact , the existence of a non - zero confidence region is a general feature of the lensing systems in our simulations .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ fig : nfwarray ] it is clear that the intrinsic confidence region of a lensing system represents a fundamental limit on the determination of the cosmological parameters from a single configuration . even in the optimal scenario , i.e. complete knowledge of the lens system , one must consider the confidence region and not the best fitting cosmology in a rigorous statistical treatment .",
    "the best - fitting cosmological parameters , as for example employed in @xcite , can not be used to characterize the cosmological parameter recovery , since they do not take into account the limitation of the intrinsic confidence region . noting this property , we have used cis exclusively in this work .      in practice",
    ", one does not have prior information on all the parameters defining the mass profile of an observed lensing cluster .",
    "for the nfw lensing profile , there are three combinations of the lens parameters to consider marginalizing over when recovering the cosmology .",
    "these are : the velocity dispersion @xmath50 , the scale radius @xmath115 and both @xmath50 and @xmath115 .",

    "for the case of marginalization over @xmath115 alone , in which @xmath50 is held fixed , closed confidence contours are obtained in the @xmath30-@xmath32 plane .",
    "this is distinct from the contours derived for the marginalization over @xmath50 alone , which yields a confidence region which follows the contours of constant cosmological family ratio @xmath57 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfwarray ] , the simultaneous marginalization of @xmath115 and @xmath50 expands the 4@xmath103 confidence region asymmetrically .",
    "in addition , note that all other confidence contours qualitatively follow the contours for the family ratio .",
    "therefore it is obvious that optimization over both the characteristic density and scale radius is required when recovering cosmology constraints from the nfw profile .",
    "an additional comment on fig .",
    "[ fig : nfwarray ] is warranted with regard to the cosmology recovery .",
    "it is obvious from the panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfwarray ] that when only @xmath170 or only @xmath50 are allowed to vary , that tighter cosmological constraints are obtained , compared to the case where both @xmath170 and @xmath50 are marginalized over simultaneously ( bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nfwarray ] ) .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask , what are the cosmology recovery properties in the cases where only @xmath170 or @xmath50 are marginalized for stacked clusters ? however , when considering actual cluster lenses , if we were to marginalize over say only @xmath170 , we would have to fix the velocity dispersion .",
    "this would require an additional prior , and in actual cluster lenses this prior is not typically available .",
    "it may be possible to constrain the total cluster mass through x - ray observations , and in this case , one would use equation  ( [ eqn : nfwtotalmass ] ) to apply the priors to _ both _ the velocity dispersion and the scale radius .",
    "however , in general , when using an nfw profile to model an actual strong lensing cluster , both @xmath170 and @xmath50 are not known a priori @xcite .",
    "the reader should therefore note that although stronger cosmological constraints could be obtained if @xmath170 or @xmath50 were known a priori , this is not the case in actual cluster models because separate priors on @xmath170 or @xmath50 can not be found . to this end , we have only presented the marginalization over both @xmath170 and @xmath50 in section  [ sec : recovery ] .",
    "up to this point , we have considered a simple minimization routine of the lens parameters with respect to the @xmath7 estimator .",
    "we have done this over the cosmological plane and for different lens parameter combinations for the nfw profile .",
    "however , we now examine the validity of this assumption for the nfw lensing configuration in section  [ sec : marglens ] .    we now perform a full multi - dimensional marginalization over the lens parameters , @xmath115 and @xmath50 , for the nfw lensing configuration .",
    "our adopted method is as follows : first , we find the optimized lens parameters which gives the minimum @xmath171 at each cosmology point . from the optimized lens parameters ,",
    "we then compute a @xmath7 surface extending to @xmath172 .",
    "the parameter spacing on the @xmath7 surface is @xmath78arcsec for @xmath115 and @xmath173 km s@xmath161 for @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath7 surface is then converted into a likelihood surface using , @xmath174 which is integrated to obtain the marginalized likelihood at a given cosmology input .",
    "this likelihood is then converted to a @xmath7 surface , using @xmath175 .    to quantify the difference between the multi - dimensional marginalization and the simple optimization method",
    ", we consider an integral which characterizes the enclosed area , @xmath176 where @xmath53 defines the confidence contour , and @xmath177 the region enclosed by the given contour .    for the multi - dimensional marginalization over @xmath115 and @xmath50 , we have approximately , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "whereas for the simple @xmath7 minimization @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "the difference between the enclosed area is largest for @xmath154 , which is @xmath186 per cent .",
    "importantly , the 1@xmath103 contour from the simple optimization method encloses an area larger than the full multi - dimensional marginalization .",
    "both methods recover a @xmath187 at the input cosmology .    given the maximum @xmath188 per cent difference between the enclosed areas from the multi - dimensional marginalization and the simple @xmath7-optimization , we are justified in using the simple optimization method .",
    "with sufficient multiple images to constrain the cluster potential , one expects only one global minimum in the @xmath7 optimization surface .",
    "this is the case for the nfw lensing configuration considered here , and for similar lensing configurations one expects the optimization method to accurately reproduce the confidence contours derived from a full multi - dimensional marginalization .",
    "we have also simulated smooth cluster lenses that contain observational noise .",
    "the noise sources we have considered are positional errors and redshift error .",
    "these two sources are the two major observational parameters which will determine the type of survey required for the application of csl .",
    "our simulations are restricted to the 5 families 10 cluster case ( see bottom right panel in fig .  [ fig5and10clusters ] ) in the @xmath30-@xmath32 plane .",
    "our objective is to examine the levels of noise which do not lead to relaxation of the cis , when compared to our simulations of the ideal case .",
    "we use this approach since this will represent a tolerance threshold where parameter constraints will weaken .",
    "first we consider redshift accuracy .",
    "we have re - run the 5 families 10 cluster simulation with gaussian redshift noise with the following standard deviations @xmath189 and @xmath190 . when adding the noise to the source redshift , we draw from the appropriate gaussian and add the resultant value to the known redshift .",
    "note that all multiple images of a given family receive the same noise contribution to their redshift .",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "we find that photometric redshift accuracy , i.e. @xmath191 , leads to significant relaxing of the cis and in some cases does not recover the input cosmology correctly . of the remaining standard deviation simulations , all recover the input cosmology with increasingly tighter constraints . for @xmath192 ,",
    "there is negligible confidence contour relaxation when compared to the ideal simulation .",
    "next we move onto image positions . following a similar procedure to the redshifts",
    ", we find that a positional accuracy of @xmath193 pixels of the _ hst _ acs is required to recover the confidence region in the @xmath66-@xmath32 plane .",
    "this means that space based imaging of the strong lensing clusters will be required .",
    "we have also considered image position error in combination with redshift error , and find that the combination @xmath192 and @xmath193 pixels in acs does not lead to relaxation of the confidence contours compared to the ideal case .",
    "this means that space based imaging of strong cluster lenses , followed up by spectroscopic redshift determination of the multiple images , is the appropriate survey method to pursue for the application of csl to cosmography .",
    "as with any other method used to constrain cosmological parameters , csl has a number of sources of error one must consider .",
    "our goal has been to examine observational strategies under the most optimal conditions in this first detailed study .",
    "our results demonstrate that by stacking lensing clusters with several multiple image families , confidence regions for the input cosmological parameters can be recovered , as shown in figs  [ fig5and10clusters ] and [ fig40and100clusters ] .    in earlier work",
    ", @xcite raised the issue of parameter bias introduced by the unknown cluster mass profile , and the presence of substructure .",
    "they concluded from extracting the best - fitting cosmological parameters ( rather than confidence regions ) that this technique produces @xmath194 per cent errors for a single cluster .",
    "we are not disputing the importance of correctly modelling the mass profile and substructure .",
    "however , in our simulations we have focused on the recovery properties of the ideal scenario , and the errors cosmography csl can tolerate in an observational data set .",
    "@xcite has also investigated the recovery bias including line of sight density fluctuations using a single numerical cluster .",
    "it should also be pointed out that any parameter recovery bias resulting from substructure along the line of sight ( fig .",
    "4 of @xcite ) , will be minimized if uncorrelated lines of sight are used when constructing the cosmological constraints .",
    "also , bias due to line of sight substructure could possibly be accounted for , by performing redshift surveys behind cluster lenses and modeling any detected structure along the line of sight in multiple lens planes . removing the systematic parameter bias due to substructure along",
    "the line of sight is an important topic that requires further investigation and is left for future work .",
    "since we have only used positional accuracy in our cosmological recovery , we should ask : what additional @xmath7 measures can we add to our current recovery measure of equation ( [ eqn : chi2 ] ) that will further constrain the input cosmology ?",
    "the first obvious candidate is a higher order shape estimators for multiple images , since we have ignored all shapes and simply used a point approximation in our simulations . in real clusters",
    "multiply imaged sources will have their shapes distorted as they are strongly lensed and this will give additional information about the lensing mass distribution , see for example @xcite .",
    "another improvement may come from the possibility of using other observational maps of clusters to infer additional properties of the cluster .",
    "for example , a total mass constraint can be obtained from x - ray cluster observations .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the recovery of input cosmological parameters using the cosmological family ratio for several sets of multiple images in stacked simulated smooth lensing clusters . for a given lensing configuration ,",
    "the constraints on the @xmath30-@xmath32 plane are tighter than those on the @xmath66-@xmath65 plane .",
    "we find that the recovery of input parameters depends both on the number of multiple image families with known redshifts and the number of clusters stacked .",
    "as shown in figs  [ fig5and10clusters ] and [ fig40and100clusters ] , the confidence contours tighten as we increase the number of families from 2 - 5 , and as the total number of stacked clusters is increased from 1 - 100 .",
    "for example , the recovery is comparable in terms of area enclosed within the 1@xmath103 - 4@xmath103 contours for the case with 5 families using 40 clusters and 3 families using 100 clusters . as we demonstrate , both strategies  stacking fewer clusters with a larger number of image families or a larger number of clusters with fewer families lead to comparable constraints .",
    "currently there are about 40 clusters with high resolution _ hst _",
    "acs images , of which a handful ( about 7 - 10 ) have more than 3 families of multiple images with measured redshifts . proposed future space missions , the james webb space telescope and jdem will enlarge the existing lensing cluster samples by a factor of 20 or more , while simultaneously detecting a larger number of families on average for each cluster through very deep imaging .",
    "determining spectroscopic redshifts for multiple image families is likely the limiting step in terms of the observational effort for the csl method .",
    "if 10 clusters with 3 multiply imaged sources are stacked , the dark energy equation of state in a flat universe can be constrained to @xmath195 at 2@xmath103 where @xmath66 has been marginalized over , see fig .  [ fig5and10clusters ] .",
    "this is comparable with current methods @xcite .",
    "therefore to be competitive with current methods , given that actual massive cluster lenses will present sub - optimal recovery conditions relative to those considered here , an initial application of csl to actual lensing clusters will require at least 10 clusters with 3 or more multiply imaged sources with abell 1689 quality _ hst _ acs images .",
    "such constraints may be obtained only if the source redshifts are determined spectroscopically .",
    "these factors indicates that initial observations should focus on massive clusters that exhibit large lensing cross sections .",
    "once these strong lensing clusters are imagined to abell 1689 quality with the _ hst _ , those with 3 or more multiply imaged sources should be given priority when determining which lensing clusters to follow up spectroscopically .",
