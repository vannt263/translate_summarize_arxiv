    "recent solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments have provided us with compelling evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the mns matrix reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 ) .",
    "the latest global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data yields @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 at the @xmath3 c.l . , and the best - fit values of three mixing angles @xmath5 , @xmath20 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "note that the global analysis has shown more than @xmath3 evidence for a non - vanishing reactor mixing angle @xmath21 , while the maximal atmospheric mixing @xmath9 is still allowed at the @xmath22 c.l .",
    "however , three cp - violating phases @xmath23 are entirely unconstrained . the smallest mixing angle @xmath24 and the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath25 will be measured in the ongoing and forthcoming neutrino oscillation experiments , while the majorana cp - violating phases @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be constrained in the neutrinoless double beta decay experiments and colliders .    how to understand the lepton flavor mixing pattern remains an open question in elementary particle physics .",
    "based on the observed neutrino mixing angles , however , several interesting constant mixing patterns have been proposed and widely discussed in the context of flavor symmetries . for instance , the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern with @xmath28 , @xmath9 and @xmath29 is in good agreement with current oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "its predictions of @xmath9 and @xmath29 have motivated a torrent of activities in the model building with discrete flavor symmetries , which give rise to the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing at the leading order ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . nevertheless , the latest result from the t2k experiment  @xcite , in which @xmath30 oscillations have been observed , indicates @xmath31 for the normal mass hierarchy and @xmath32 for the inverted mass hierarchy at the @xmath33 c.l .",
    "the best - fit value from t2k data is @xmath34 , which is also consistent with the global - fit analysis .",
    "moreover , the minos experiment has recently reported the observation of @xmath30 oscillations , disfavoring the assumption of @xmath29 at the @xmath35 c.l .",
    "possible ways to realize a relatively large @xmath24 have recently been discussed in ref .",

    "the prediction of @xmath8 from the tetra - maximal mixing pattern is in excellent agreement with the latest neutrino oscillation data , while that of @xmath37 and the maximal cp - violating phase @xmath38 may hint at a certain flavor symmetry .    in the present work , we consider possible deviations from the tetra - maximal mixing pattern .",
    "the motivation for such an investigation is two - fold .",
    "first , the solar mixing angle predicted by the tetra - maximal mixing pattern is @xmath39 , which is much smaller than the best - fit value @xmath5 and even not lying in the @xmath3 range from the global analysis .",
    "second , if the tetra - maximal mixing pattern is obtained by assuming a certain flavor symmetry , which in general works at a high - energy scale , the mixing angles will receive significant radiative corrections when running from the symmetry scale to the low - energy scale , at which the mixing angles are actually measured in oscillation experiments .",
    "one immediate question is whether it is possible to increase @xmath4 to the observed value by introducing explicit perturbations to the tetra - maximal mixing pattern or by taking into account the radiative corrections , while both @xmath40 and @xmath24 remain consistent with experimental data .",
    "we have found the answer is affirmative .",
    "the remaining part of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we show that only one perturbation parameter is enough to increase @xmath4 to its best - fit value , and leads to an even larger @xmath24 . furthermore , we demonstrate that both the maximal atmospheric mixing angle @xmath9 and the maximal cp - violating phase @xmath41 are not affected by the perturbation to any order . in sec .",
    "iii , we explicitly solve the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) for neutrino mixing parameters within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and confirm that the observed @xmath4 can be obtained at the electroweak scale @xmath42 from the tetra - maximal mixing pattern at the high - energy scale @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , both @xmath24 and @xmath40 , as well as three cp - violating phases @xmath44 , are rather stable against the radiative corrections . finally , we summarize our conclusions in sec .  iv .",

    "although @xmath8 is relatively large and well compatible with the recent t2k and minos results , @xmath54 is much smaller than the best - fit value @xmath55 , and even not covered in the @xmath3 range , i.e. , @xmath56 . in order to increase @xmath4 significantly but not change much both @xmath40 and @xmath24 such that all three mixing angles become consistent with current oscillation data",
    ", we have to slightly modify the tetra - maximal mixing pattern in a proper manner .",
    "one straightforward way is just to introduce a small perturbation to the maximal rotation in the @xmath57-@xmath58 complex plane . in this case , the mns matrix turns out to be @xmath59 with @xmath60 . in order to see how the neutrino mixing angles are changed , we expand the mns matrix in eq .",

    "inserting @xmath65 into the second identity , one can obtain @xmath66 , which is in good agreement with the t2k result  @xcite and close to the @xmath3 upper limit @xmath67 from the global - fit analysis  @xcite .",
    "note that the maximal atmospheric mixing angle , i.e. , @xmath37 , is not modified , because there is a generalized permutation symmetry in the tetra - maximal mixing matrix in eq .",
    "( 3 ) and its perturbed version in eq .  ( 5 ) : @xmath68 for both @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 denotes the exchange of the second and third rows .",
    "such a permutation symmetry originates from the pure phase matrix @xmath72 and the first maximal rotation @xmath73 , which are the only complex matrices .",
    "hence we have @xmath74 that is independent of the perturbation .",
    "3 .   the tetra - maximal mixing pattern predicts the maximal cp - violating phase @xmath41 and the jarlskog invariant @xmath75 = -1/32 $ ] for leptonic cp violation  @xcite .",

    "the proof is as follows : 1",

    "as long as the perturbations are small , the sign of @xmath93 is determined by the tetra - maximal mixing matrix @xmath94 and thus @xmath95 is valid to any order of perturbations .",
    "4 .   in the basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal",

    "<S> the tetra - maximal neutrino mixing pattern predicts a relatively large reactor mixing angle @xmath0 , which is in good agreement with the latest best - fit value @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , its prediction for @xmath2 is inconsistent with current oscillation data at the @xmath3 c.l . </S>",
    "<S> we show that explicit perturbations to the tetra - maximal mixing can naturally enhance @xmath4 to its best - fit value @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate that if the tetra - maximal mixing is produced by a certain flavor symmetry at a high - energy scale @xmath6 , significant radiative corrections in the minimal supersymmetric standard model can modify @xmath4 to be compatible with experimental data at the electroweak scale @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as well as the cp - violating phases @xmath10 , are rather stable against radiative corrections . </S>"
