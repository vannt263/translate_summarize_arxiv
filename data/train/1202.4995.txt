    "the discovery by hawking @xcite of the result that the area @xmath1 of an arbitrary black hole never decreases , together with the idea of the penrose process @xcite of extraction of energy of rotating black holes , led to the establishment of the thermodynamics of the gravitational field .",

    "the initial mass @xmath2 and angular momentum @xmath3 of the kerr black hole vary by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , such that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the angular velocity of the external event horizon of the black hole . in this process ,",

    "this result is justified because inside the ergosphere it is not possible to maintain any observer in static regime . inside the ergosphere",

    "<S> the concept of gravitational pressure is naturally defined in the context of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> together with the definition of gravitational energy , we investigate the thermodynamics of rotating black holes in the teleparallel framework . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the value of the gravitational pressure over the external event horizon of the kerr black hole , and write an expression for the thermodynamic relation @xmath0 , where the variations refer to the penrose process for the kerr black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we employ only the notions of gravitational energy and pressure that arise in teleparallel gravity , and do not make any consideration of the area or the variation of the area of the event horizon </S>",
    "<S> . however , our results are qualitatively similar to the standard expression of the literature .     </S>",
