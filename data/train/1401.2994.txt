    "recent work is bringing forth a picture of complex and diverse globular cluster ( gc ) populations in elliptical galaxies , consistent with several merging episodes of which the different gc populations are the fossil remnant  ( @xcite , for m87 ;  @xcite , for ngc4365 ) . our work on the elliptical galaxy ngc4261 has shown large - scale spiral - like features in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) gc distribution  @xcite , which would have been unreported in the study of radial distributions .",
    "this continuing merging evolution would be expected in the framework of simulations based on the @xmath0cdm model of hierarchical galaxy formation  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model of hierarchical galaxy formation  @xcite has been successful in reproducing several results of both deep and large sky surveys ( e.g. ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , direct observational validation of continuous galaxy evolution via satellite merging from observations of galaxies in the local universe is only recently appearing in the literature , and has been mostly limited to the milky way and local group .",
    "large - scale surveys of the stellar population of the milky way have shown an increasing complex dynamical environment of satellite dwarf galaxies interacting gravitationally with and being accreted by our galaxy ( e.g. the sloan digital sky survey results of  @xcite ) .",
    "the sagittarius stream  @xcite is a well - studied example of this phenomenon .",
    "a wide - area survey of the m31-m33 region confirms this picture , detecting streams and dwarf galaxies in the halo of m31 and in the region between m31 and m33  @xcite .",
    "although these subtle details may not be perceivable beyond our local group , gcs may provide a marker of these interactions in farther away systems .",
    "observationally , for example , the sagittarius dwarf / stream is associated with several gcs ( e.g. ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "although the parent dwarf galaxy may be disrupted , and therefore hard to be detected against the background of the more luminous dominant galaxy , gc may retain the information of the encounter .",
    "this is suggested by simulations - albeit limited to the tidal evolution of gcs in dwarf spheroidal dark matter halos - which show that gcs with combined high mass and high density will survive the encounter  @xcite .",
    "the giant elliptical galaxy ngc4649 ( m60 ) in the virgo cluster was recently surveyed with several chandra and hst exposures , completely covering the area within the d25 ellipse  @xcite and extending with variable coverage to larger radii .",
    "the resulting catalogs of gcs  @xcite and low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs )  @xcite give us a unique opportunity to study the properties of these populations and to explore further the gc - lmxb connection  ( see review , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with full spatial coverage .",
    "ngc4649 is a relatively isolated galaxy , except for the close neighbor spiral ngc4647 , with which ngc4649 may be tidally interacting  @xcite .    in the first follow - up paper based on these chandra and hst data  @xcite , we studied the radial distributions of the gcs and lmxbs populations and compared them with that of the optical surface brightness , which is a good proxy of the stellar mass for the old stellar population of ngc4649 .",
    "the radial distributions of red and blue gcs differ , as generally observed in other galaxies  ( see review , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the blue gc radial profile is definitely wider than that of the stellar light .",
    "the red gcs profile is steeper , close to that of the stellar light , with a noticeable `` dip '' in the denser centermost region ( r@xmath1 3 kpc at the ngc4649 distance of 16.5 mpc  @xcite ) , where tidal disruption of gcs may be more efficient .",
    "the lmxbs associated with gcs follow the same radial distributions as their parent gc populations .",
    "roughly three times more of these lmxbs are found in red rather than in blue gcs , as generally observed in early - type galaxies  ( @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ; see  @xcite for a theoretical explanation ) .",
    "the field lmxbs - those without a gc counterpart - follow the stellar light , i.e. , the mass distribution of old stars , within the @xmath2 ellipse  @xcite .",
    "@xcite also report a departure of the lmxb radial distribution from that of the stellar mass at larger galactocentric radii , which could also be associated with more luminous sources . as discussed there , this over - luminosity may point to a younger field lmxb population : evolutionary models of native field lmxb populations have shown that lmxbs become fainter with the increasing age of the parent stellar population  @xcite .    here",
    "we complete our study of the spatial distribution of the gc populations in ngc4649 , by examining their 2d observed distributions , to explore the presence of irregularities that may point to mergers or satellite accretion by ngc4649 .",
    "given the association and possible evolutionary relation between gcs and lmxbs  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and refs .",
    "therein ) , we also extend this study to the lmxb population of ngc4649 .",
    "in particular we seek to explore if the regularity observed in the radial distributions of these sources still persists in the azimuthal dimension .    in section 2",
    "we describe the catalogs of gcs and lmxbs used in this paper .",
    "these data were analyzed with the method described in  @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the k - nearest neighbor ( knn ) density estimator  @xcite , augmented by monte carlo simulations , to estimate the statistical significance of any spatial feature ( section  [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : densityresidual ] and discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we summarize our finding in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . in this paper",
    "we adopt a distance of 16.5 mpc to ngc4649  @xcite . at this distance ,",
    "an angular separation of 1@xmath3 corresponds to a linear distance of @xmath44.8 kpc .",
    "the gc and lmxb samples used in this work are the results of the joint chandra - hst large - area mapping of ngc4649 ( pi fabbiano ) . the gc sample is based on the gc catalog extracted by  @xcite from six hst acs pointings of ngc4649 .",
    "it contains 1603 gcs with photometry in @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters , selected by requiring @xmath7 and @xmath8 and discarding all sources with size consistent with the psf ( presumed to be foreground stars ) .",
    "this catalog includes 841 red gcs with @xmath9 , and 762 blue gcs with @xmath10 .",
    "the color threshold was derived from  @xcite after verifying that significant color substructures are visible in the whole interval of galactocentric distances explored by the catalog of gcs .",
    "while the shapes and positions of the red and blue features in the color distribution of gcs ( see figure  6 in  @xcite ) show a slight dependence on the galactocentric distance within ngc4649 , the @xmath11 value allows a clear separation of the two gcs color classes over the whole range of distances . for our analysis",
    "we have also considered a split of the sample in luminosity , resulting in 467 high - luminosity gcs with @xmath12 , and 1136 low - luminosity gcs with @xmath13 . as discussed later in section",
    "[ sec : method ] , small variations of both color and luminosity boundaries do not alter the results of our analysis . in this particular case ,",
    "the magnitude threshold used to define low- and high - luminosity gcs was chosen only to provide luminosity classes of similar sizes ( see table  [ tab : summary ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : positions ] ( left ) shows the spatial distributions of the gcs in the plane of the sky .",
    "the hst pointings overlap marginally with the @xmath2 elliptical isophote of the neighboring spiral galaxy ngc4647 .",
    "we have excluded all the gcs within the ngc4647 @xmath2 ellipse from the sample used to evaluate the observed density profile of gcs in ngc4649 ( see section  [ sec : method ] ) , but we have kept them in the density maps .         the lmxb sample is from the catalog of  @xcite , where identifications with gcs are based on  @xcite .",
    "this catalog was derived from six _ chandra _ acis - s3 pointings of ngc4649 , reaching a total exposure of 299 ks and yielding a total of 501 x - ray sources with 0.3 - 8.0 kev luminosities ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ergs s@xmath16 . out of the total 427 lmxbs within the hst combined footprint ,",
    "161 are gc - lmxbs and 266 are found in the stellar field of ngc4649 ( field lmxbs ) .",
    "moreover , 74 lmxbs were detected in the region external to the hst footprint ( see  @xcite ) . of the x - ray sources detected in the area",
    "not overlapped by the hst observations used to extract the catalog of gcs used in this paper , twelve of them can be identified with gcs in the ground - based catalog of  @xcite ; the other x - ray sources in this area are likely to be mostly background active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , based on the contamination estimates of  @xcite . to avoid the large uncertainties on the sample of x - ray sources detected at larger radii , in this paper we will derive the density reconstruction of only the gcs and field lmxbs located within the hst footprint .",
    "only @xmath17 background agns are expected within the @xmath2 elliptical isophote of ngc4649 ; these are likely to contaminate the field lmxb sample , because the gc identification excludes this contamination in the sample of gc - lmxbs .",
    "we have also explored luminosity classes based on a threshold of @xmath18 erg s@xmath16 for the lmxbs .",
    "the two luminosity classes comprise 339 and 162 sources respectively .",
    "the higher luminosity class may contain a larger proportion of black hole binaries or of younger lmxbs  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the lmxbs is shown in figure  [ fig : positions ] ( right ) .",
    "the number of members of each class of sources investigated in this paper is reported in table  [ tab : summary ] .",

    "we determined the 2d spatial distributions of gcs and lmxbs by applying a method based on the knn density estimator  @xcite .",
    "we used simulations to evaluate the significance of the results .",
    "a detailed explanation of our application of the knn method can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the assumption behind the knn method is that the density is locally constant .",
    "the uncertainty on the knn density scales with the square root of @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is the index of the nearest neighbor used to calculate the density and the fractional accuracy of the method increases with increasing k at the expense of the spatial resolution . for each sample discussed in this paper , we calculated the 2d surface densities for @xmath26 ranging from 2 to 9 , and a regular grid with spacing @xmath27 @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) for the gcs , and @xmath27 @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath30 @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) for the lmxbs .",
    "these grids define 2d cells of `` pixels '' .",
    "this choice of grids is justified by the different areas covered by the hst and _ chandra _ observations and produces similar average number of source per pixel for both gcs and lmxbs .",
    "this choice permits to compare meaningfully the statistical reliability of the features determined in density and residual maps for both classes of sources .",
    "the density in the boundary pixels was weighted according to the fraction of the pixel within the observed region .    to assess the statistical significance of features suggested by the knn density maps ( hereafter `` observed '' density maps ) , we employed monte - carlo simulations , using the observed radial distributions of each of the classes of gcs and lmxbs investigated , as seeds .",
    "the azimuthal distributions were independently extracted from a uniformly random distribution between 0@xmath35 and @xmath36 . a geometrical correction on the expected number of gcs per elliptical annulus",
    "was applied to take into account the eccentricity of the galaxy .",
    "we performed @xmath37 simulations for each of the samples described in table  [ tab : summary ] , and analyzed the results as done with the observed data ( see above ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : radialprofiles ] compares observed and simulated mean radial density profiles for the gc and lmxb samples , respectively .    to characterize the deviations from the average 2d trends of the gc and lmxb distributions , we calculated maps of residuals by subtracting pixel - by - pixel the mean simulated density map from the corresponding observed density map , and normalizing to the value of the density in the average simulated map .",
    "the pixel - by - pixel distributions of the simulated knn densities are well approximated by gaussians , simplifying the calculation of the statistical significance of the residuals . to evaluate the latter , for each set of simulated density maps we calculated the fraction of pixels with values above the 90-th percentile of the densities in the observed maps ( the `` extreme '' pixels ) . since these extreme pixels in both observed density and",
    "residual maps tend to be spatially correlated , we also evaluated the fraction of simulations with at least one group of contiguous extreme pixels ( with area equal to 18 pixels ) as large as the observed . since we did not impose any specific geometry to the groups of simulated contiguous extreme pixels , these fractions are upper limits to the fraction expected for a given spatial distribution of residuals .",
    "the results are given in section  [ sec : densityresidual ] .",
    "as discussed above , the radial distributions of the simulated distributions of sources follow the observed radial distributions , while the azimuthal distribution is uniform in the @xmath38 $ ] interval .",
    "if the incompleteness of the observed distribution of sources is a function only of the radial distance from the center without azimuthal dependencies , it will affect in the same way both observed and simulated density maps .",
    "accordingly , in this paper we have not included completeness corrections for either gc and lmxb samples because both populations are affected by incompleteness which only depends on the radial dependence from the center of the ngc4649 galaxy ( see  @xcite for gcs and lmxbs incompleteness maps respectively ) .",

    "our analysis of the two - dimensional projected distribution of the gc and lmxb populations of the giant virgo elliptical ngc4649 ( m60 ) confirms a well - known feature of this gc system , that red gcs are more centrally concentrated than blue gcs , as usually observed in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; see also  @xcite for ngc4649 ) , but also finds unexpected significant and complex 2d asymmetries in their projected distributions .",
    "ngc4649 is the third most luminous galaxy in the virgo cluster , and resides in a galaxy - dense environment , where gravitational interactions and accretion of satellites may be frequent .",
    "kinematics evidence , suggesting a merging and accretion past for this galaxy , was recently found in studies of planetary nebulae ( pn ) and gcs  @xcite . in particular ,  @xcite show that at galactocentric radii larger than 12 kpc , pns and gcs may belong to separate dynamical systems .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by  @xcite , who propose either tidal stripping of gcs for less massive companion galaxies , or a combination of multiple mergers and dwarf galaxy accretion events to explain the observed kinematics .",
    "besides experiencing continuing evolution at the outer radii via interaction with and accretion of companions , ngc4649 itself may be the result of a major dry merger .",
    "this is suggested by recent kinematical measurements of the diffuse stellar light that revealed disk - like outer rotation , as it may have stemmed from a massive lenticular galaxy progenitor  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropies we find in the 2d distribution of gcs may be a different pointer to this complex evolution .",
    "we have found that in ngc4649 , the 2d distribution of gcs shows strong positive residuals along the eastern major axis of the galaxy , with a northward arc - like curvature beginning at a galacto - centric radius of @xmath95 kpc and extending out to @xmath96 kpc .",
    "this large - scale feature is more prominent in the distribution of red gcs , but can still be seen in the 2d distribution of blue gcs , which is overall noisier .",
    "high - luminosity gcs tend to concentrate at the southern end of this feature , while low - luminosity gcs are found in the northern portion .",
    "these trends and differences are highlighted in figure  [ fig : sigma_pixels_maps_gc ] , which displays the most significant single pixels ( @xmath97 ) of each residual distribution .",
    "the extreme pixel distributions of red gcs ( upper left ) and low - luminosity gcs ( lower right ) are similar , and differ from those of high - l gcs .",
    "the reason for this similarity resides in the choice of the particular magnitude threshold used to define luminosity classes ( see discussion in section  [ sec : data ] and table  [ tab : summary ] ) . with the @xmath12 threshold ,",
    "red and blue gcs comprise @xmath98 and @xmath99 of low - l gcs , respectively . using @xmath100 as a threshold instead , the residual maps of low - l and high - l gcs are more similar , although high - l and low - l still are spatially segregated in the n side of the `` arc '' . however , this magnitude threshold yields 140 high - l gcs and 1463 low - l gcs .",
    "+     +    the color and luminosity differences suggest that we may not simply be witnessing the disruption of a satellite dwarf galaxy , and observing the stream of its gc system .",
    "perhaps some additional gc formation resulted from this merger , increasing the population of red , high - metallicity gcs .",
    "gc formation during galaxy merging has been suggested as an important mechanism for the assembly of gc systems , especially in the case of large elliptical galaxies  @xcite , and is supported by high - resolution simulations of galaxy mergers  @xcite .",
    "numerous young massive stellar clusters , which may evolve into gcs , are for example seen in the advanced merger remnant ngc7252  @xcite .",
    "this picture is being confirmed by other observational studies .",
    "a kinematical study of the gc system of the central galaxy of the virgo cluster , m87 , shows the presence of significant sub - structures , pointing to active galaxy assembly  @xcite . in the virgo elliptical ngc4365 ,",
    "three separate rotating gc systems have been reported associated with the three color - families of gcs , in addition to a stream - like system  @xcite .    with the exception of the large - scale arc structure observed in ngc4261  @xcite",
    ", little evidence is available in the literature about the 2d spatial distribution of gcs in early - type galaxies , let alone about the differences in the spatial distributions of gc color and luminosity classes due to major mergers .",
    "@xcite discussed the existence of a phase space shell composed of gcs located in the inner halo of m87 , which is possibly due to a significant merger , but there is no evidence of similar structures in the gc spatial distribution in m87 . based on these results",
    ", we deduce that the differences in the spatial distribution of high- and low - luminosity gcs in the n section of the ngc4649 arc suggests a more complex history involving both external minor accretion events and internal mechanisms that could influence the evolution of the ngc4649 gc system ( i.e. , dynamical friction and/or disk shocking ) .",
    "overall , the emerging picture is a perturbed gc system , suggesting a still evolving ngc4649 , perhaps caught in the moment of accreting some smaller satellite galaxy .",
    "this interpretation is not straightforward because other supporting evidence is still lacking other than the overall kinematics of pn , gcs and the stellar component of ngc4649  @xcite .",
    "we have searched for the kinematical signature of gravitational interactions and accretion of satellites undergoing in ngc4649 , by comparing the gc over - densities with the radial velocities for the sample of 121 gcs discussed by  @xcite with spectroscopic observations .",
    "we do not find any obvious correlation .",
    "moreover ,  @xcite obtained spectra of 38 gcs in ngc4649 ( all included in our sample ) and did not find evidence that red gcs are significantly younger than blue gcs",
    ". however , the gc samples of  @xcite and  @xcite are both sparse and do not provide the optimal coverage of the over - density feature .    the similarity of the radial density profiles of red and blue gcs in ngc4649 ( per figure  [ fig : radialprofiles ] , left ) would be in principle consistent with ngc4649 being the result of a major dry merger  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , our results suggest that the flattening of the radial density profiles of both color classes , instead than being the result of a global process with no azimuthal dependence , could be driven by the existence of major features in the spatial distribution of gcs . in the case of ngc4649 ,",
    "the arc extending from the center of the galaxy to the @xmath2 isophote and more significant for red gcs than for blue gcs , could be the responsible for the overall similarity of the radial density profiles of the two gc color classes .",
    "it has been recognized since their early discovery in the milky way that dynamical formation of lmxbs in gcs is highly efficient  @xcite ; some of these binaries could then be either kicked out from the parent cluster or be left in the stellar field after cluster disruption  @xcite  ( see also * ? ? ? * for early - type galaxies ) .",
    "therefore at least some field lmxbs could have been formed in gcs . however",
    ", lmxbs can also evolve from native binary systems in the stellar field  ( see review from * ? ? ?",
    "the effectiveness of either or both formation channels for the lmxb populations of both the milky way and external galaxies is still a matter of debate .",
    "based on statistical considerations on the properties of the lmxb populations detected with chandra in early - type galaxies , there is some indication that field evolution is a viable formation channel  @xcite , and that the lmxbs detected in the stellar field may be of mixed origin  @xcite .    as is the case for gcs , lmxbs are",
    "also objects that can be detected individually in elliptical galaxies with the resolution of chandra  ( see * ? ?",
    "therefore , their spatial distribution may provide some constraints on their origin .",
    "in particular , native field lmxbs should - within statistics - trace the stellar surface brightness distribution of their parent galaxy .",
    "although there has been some debate on the radial profiles of lmxbs and their comparison with those of the stellar surface brightness and of gcs  @xcite , in ngc4649 there is clear evidence  @xcite that gc - lmxbs in red and blue gcs follow the same radial profiles as their parent gc populations , while field lmxbs in ngc4649 are radially distributed like the stellar surface brightness .",
    "however , within the limited sample statistics , lmxbs in red gcs are also distributed as the stellar light , with the exception of a marked lack of both red gcs and associated lmxbs in the centermost region . therefore these results are still consistent with a mixed origin for the field lmxb population .",
    "+     +    we have found ( section  [ subsec : lmxbdensity ] ) that the 2d distribution of lmxbs shows a positive excess over a simple radial distribution with no azimuthal dependences , in the region near to the eastern major axis of ngc4649 , where the excess feature of gcs is also observed ( see figure  [ fig : sigma_pixels_maps_lmxb ] , which displays the higher significance individual pixels for the residual distribution of different classes of lmxbs ) . not surprisingly , the excess residuals of the distribution of lmxbs in gc , which are overwhelmingly associated with red gcs  @xcite , resemble those of the red gcs .",
    "however , the 2d distribution of field lmxbs also shows large - scale anisotropy , which would not be expected if these sources were solely associated with native field binaries .",
    "the excess residuals appear to be adjacent to , but not overlapping , those seen in the 2d distribution of gc - lmxbs .",
    "this excess of field lmxbs is dominated by high luminosity lmxbs ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "a second excess clump of these high - luminosity lmxbs is instead associated with the eastern end of the major axis ; this over - density of high - luminosity lmxbs is composed by equal number of gc - lmxbs and field lmxbs ( see right plot in figure  [ fig : positions ] ) .",
    "positive residuals in the low luminosity lmxb 2d distribution are found extending along the eastern major axis , mostly associated to the positions of field lmbxs ( compare right plot in figure  [ fig : positions ] ) ; given their spatial distribution , though , these are also likely to have been originated in gcs .",
    "of the two over - densities visible in the residual map generated with all the lmxbs ( figure  [ fig:2dmapsngc4649_lmxb ] ) in the n - e and s - w corners of the _ chandra _ field , only the s - w structure can be seen in the residual map generated by low - l@xmath102 lmxbs ; neither is see in the high - l@xmath102 residuals ( figure  [ fig : sigma_pixels_maps_lmxb ] ) .",
    "the differences in the significance of these two lmxb over - density structures are due to the higher values of the radial density profile of high - l lmxbs at larger radii compared to that of low - l at large radii ( see figure  [ fig : radialprofiles ] ) , while both over - densities are composed of similar fractions of high and low luminosity x - ray sources .",
    "the n - e structure contains a total of 23 x - ray sources ( 12 low - luminosity and 11 high - luminosity ) , while the s - w region contains 45 total sources ( 27 low - luminosity and 18 high - luminosity ) .",
    "the presence of this high - l excess of field sources , to the south of the gc ( and gc - lmxb ) excess feature , suggests that these sources can not have been formed in gcs and ejected in the field , unless the streaming motion of the gcs and of the ejected lmxbs are subject to different accelerations . the escape velocity for a typical gc can be as low as @xmath430 km s@xmath16  @xcite , where the range of line of sight velocities observed for gcs in massive elliptical galaxies extends from few to few thousands",
    "km s@xmath16  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that lacking other forces , the lmxbs ejected should settle into a cloud surrounding their parent gcs . however , dynamical friction may cause the observed positional offset between the over - density of red gcs observed along the e side of the major axis ( upper right plot in figure  [ fig : sigma_pixels_maps_lmxb ] ) and the field lmxbs structure observed along the @xmath2 isophote south of the main gcs over - density ( upper left plot in figure  [ fig : sigma_pixels_maps_lmxb ] ) .",
    "we assume a standard mass for the lmxbs - hosting gcs @xmath103 consistent with their average absolute magnitudes  @xcite .",
    "we further assume a circular velocity @xmath104 km s@xmath16 based on the results from  @xcite .",
    "using as starting radial distance half the length of the major axis of the galaxy equivalent to @xmath105 kpc , we estimate the time required to recreate the angular and radial separation of the field lmxbs and gcs lmxbs over - densities with equation ( 7 - 26 ) of  @xcite , that evaluates the time required for a gc moving on a circular orbit of radius @xmath106 with velocity @xmath107 to reach the center of the galaxy ( @xmath108 is assumed , based on typical values of the gc physical parameters ) :    @xmath109    we obtain a time scale of @xmath110 gyr . this timespan is shorter than the average gc age of @xmath11110 gyr estimated by  @xcite , and within the range of single gcs measurements by these authors .",
    "accurate kinematic measurements for gc population in ngc4649 would be needed to test this hypothesis . also , we point out that our simple evaluation of the effects of the dynamical friction should only be considered indicative",
    ". a full set of dynamical simulations of the evolution of the gc system of ngc4649 as the results of satellite accretion and mergers is required .",
    "alternatively , one could speculate that the merging event originating the gc over - density may have also resulted in a compressed gaseous stream from the disrupted satellite galaxy , with subsequent star and x - ray binary formation .",
    "the higher luminosity of the over - dense field x - ray sources would be consistent with a younger age than the overall lmxb population  ( @xcite ) .",

    "our analysis of the 2d projected distribution of the gc and lmxb populations of the giant virgo elliptical ngc4649 ( m60 ) has led to the following results :    * there are significant 2d asymmetries in the projected distributions of both gcs and lmxbs . *",
    "red gcs are more centrally concentrated than blue gcs , as usually observed in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; see also  @xcite for ngc4649 ) .",

    "positive excess in low luminosity lmxb , mostly composed of field lmxbs , is found extending along the e major axis ; given their position , we speculate that these sources are likely to have formed in gcs and subsequently ejected in the field .",

    "the higher x - ray luminosity portion of these sources tends to concentrate in the southern half of ngc4647 .",
    "these results have important implications for the evolution of ngc4649 .",
    "in particular , they suggest accretion and merging of satellite galaxies , of which the gc anisotropic distribution is the fossil remnant .",

    "this over density suggests that these lmxbs should be somewhat connected with the gc overdensity .",
    "the displacement , however , implies either ( 1 ) gc formation followed by ejection and dynamical friction drag on the parent gcs , or ( 2 ) field formation stimulated by compression of the ism during a merging event .",
    "we also clearly detect the over - density of x - ray sources connected with the x - ray binaries ( xrb ) population of the companion spiral galaxy ngc4647 .",
    "we note that the xrbs sources located in the southern half of the ngc4647 , where the star formation rate appears to be more intense ( see  @xcite ) , are significantly more luminous that the x - ray sources observed in northern region of ngc4647 , with @xmath101 .",
    "this result may suggest a younger xrb population .",
    "we speculate that this asymmetry may indicate the beginning of the tidal interaction of ngc4647 with ngc4649 .    our analysis and",
    "the kinematics of ngc4649  @xcite suggest a complex assembly history for this galaxy , including one major merger and a sequence of satellite accretion events , with possibly continuous tidal stripping of gcs and pns from nearby low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "explaining the origin of the over - density structures in the spatial distribution of gcs and of the luminosity and color segregations within such features in ngc4649 will require both detailed numerical simulations with a realistic model of the galaxy potential and extensive campaign for the spectroscopic observation required to reconstruct accurately the kinematics of the whole gc population .",

    "<S> we report significant anisotropies in the projected two - dimensional ( 2d ) spatial distributions of globular clusters ( gcs ) of the giant virgo elliptical galaxy ngc4649 ( m60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar features are found in the 2d distribution of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , both associated with gcs and in the stellar field . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from azimuthal symmetry suggest an arc - like excess of gcs extending north at 4 - 15 kpc galactocentric radii in the eastern side of major axis of ngc4649 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is more prominent for red gcs , but still persists in the 2d distribution of blue gcs . </S>",
    "<S> high and low luminosity gcs also show some segregation along this arc , with high - luminosity gcs preferentially located in the southern end and low - luminosity gcs in the northern section of the arc . </S>",
    "<S> gc - lmxbs follow the anisotropy of red - gcs , where most of them reside ; however , a significant overdensity of ( high - luminosity ) field lmxbs is present to the south of the gc arc . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that ngc4649 has experienced mergers and/or multiple accretions of less massive satellite galaxies during its evolution , of which the gcs in the arc may be the fossil remnant . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the observed anisotropy in the field lmxb spatial distribution indicates that these x - ray binaries may be the remnants of a star formation event connected with the merger , or maybe be ejected from the parent red gcs , if the bulk motion of these clusters is significantly affected by dynamical friction . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect a luminosity enhancement in the x - ray source population of the companion spiral galaxy ngc4647 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that these may be younger high mass x - ray binaries formed as a result of the tidal interaction of this galaxy with ngc4649 . </S>"
