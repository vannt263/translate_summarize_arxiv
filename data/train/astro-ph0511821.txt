    "almost all current cosmological observations indicate that the present universe is accelerating .",
    "it can be explained by assuming that the universe is dominated by dark energy today .",

    "many studies have been devoted to investigate dark energy assuming or constructing a specific model and then study its consequences on cosmological observations such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure ( lss ) , type ia supernovae ( sneia ) and so on . on the other hand , many efforts have also been made to study dark energy in phenomenological way , i.e. , as model independent as possible . in such approaches",
    ", dark energy can be parameterized with its equation of state and constraints on it can be obtained using cosmological observations .",
    "assuming that the equation of state for dark energy @xmath0 is constant in time , current observations give the constraint as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "although one of the most famous models for dark energy is the cosmological constant whose equation of state is @xmath2 , most models proposed so far have time - varying equation of state .",
    "thus , when we study dark energy , we should accommodate such time dependence in some way .",
    "many recent works on dark energy investigate the time dependence of the dark energy equation of state using simple parameterizations such as @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the scale factor of the universe @xcite . parameterizing the dark energy equation of state in simple ways , the constraints on the time evolution of @xmath0 have been considered ( for recent works on this issue , for example , see ref .",
    "it should be mentioned that , when one studies the equation of state for dark energy , it is usually assumed that the universe is flat .",
    "it should be also noted that dark energy is usually assumed to be the cosmological constant when one derives the constraint on the curvature of the universe .",
    "however , it has been discussed that , assuming a non - flat universe , the constraints on @xmath0 and the curvature of the universe can be relaxed to some extent even with the time independent @xmath0 from the cmb data alone @xcite . also ,",
    "even if we assume a flat universe , there are degeneracies among the parameters which describe the evolution of dark energy , i.e. , the time dependence of @xmath0 when we consider the constraints on dark energy @xcite .",
    "furthermore it has been also discussed that if we remove the prior of a flat universe , the degeneracies becomes much worse @xcite .",
    "since it is very important to study the time dependence of @xmath0 to differentiate the models of dark energy and also the curvature of the universe to test the inflationary paradigm , we should investigate how the prior on the curvature of the universe affects the determination of the time - varying equation of state for dark energy and vice versa .",
    "some works along this line have been done using a specific one - parameter parameterization for the time - varying @xmath0 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study this issue , namely the determination of the evolution of dark energy and the curvature of the universe , in some detail using widely used parameterization of the equation of state for dark energy .",

    ". then we discuss the constraints from above mentioned observations on the curvature of the universe with time - varying equation of state for dark energy followed by the analysis on @xmath0 without assuming a flat universe .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary of the paper .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the method for constraining the parameters which describe the dark energy evolutions and other cosmological parameters .",

    "since we are interested in the late - time acceleration of the universe due to dark energy , we consider the case where the dark energy dominates the universe only at late time . thus , in this paper , we assume @xmath9 in order not to include the possibilities of early - time dark energy domination . with this parameterization",

    "@xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "it has been discussed that using the cmb shift parameter is a robust way to include the constraints from observations of cmb @xcite . from the recent observations of cmb including wmap , cbi and acbar",
    ", the shift parameter is constrained to be @xmath33 @xcite    in this paper , we only consider the effect of the modification of the background evolution by the change in the cosmological parameters .",
    "in fact , the properties of dark energy can also modify the evolutions of cosmic density fluctuation .",
    "when we consider the effects of dark energy perturbation , we also have to specify the speed of sound of dark energy component .",
    "however , such modification can arise at low multipole region of the cmb power spectrum where the errors due to cosmic variance are large .",
    "thus the constraints from cmb on dark energy mostly come from the position of acoustic peaks which can be described by the shift parameter .",
    "hence we do not consider the perturbation of dark energy in this paper .",
    "now we discuss the implication of the dark energy evolution on the determination of the curvature of the universe . for this purpose",

    "first we consider the case with the constant equation of state for dark energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : om_ox_wm1 ] , we show the contours of 1@xmath36 and 2@xmath36 constraints from observations of sneia ( a ) , the baryon acoustic oscillation peak ( b ) and the cmb shift parameter ( c ) .",

    "@xcite and the data from snls @xcite separately . as we can see , although each constraint from a single observational data has the degeneracy in the @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 plane , when all the data sets are combined , we can obtain a severe constraint as @xmath38 with @xmath39 , which is a well - known result .",
    "next we consider the case where the equation of state for dark energy is allowed to vary , but still we keep @xmath0 constant in time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : om_ox_wmarg ] , we show the contours of 1@xmath36 and 2@xmath36 constraints after marginalizing over the values of @xmath0 . here",
    "we assumed the prior on @xmath0 as @xmath40 .",
    "as seen from the figure , the allowed regions become larger compared to those for the case with @xmath37 when we use a single data set alone . however , by combining all data , we can obtain almost the same constraint as the case with @xmath37 even though we marginalize over @xmath0 .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the values of @xmath0 which give the minimum @xmath41 for fixed @xmath42 from each data set are different . to see this , we also plot contours of constant @xmath0 which gives minimum values of @xmath41 at each point on the @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : om_ox_wmarg_w0min ] .",
    "we can clearly see that the favored values of @xmath0 vary for different data sets .",

    "if we vary the value of @xmath0 , the density parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 can have more freedom to be consistent with observations since the fit to the data depends on the combinations of these quantities .",

    "thus while the allowed regions become larger for each data set , when we combine all the data , the allowed region converges towards the concordance model with @xmath43 and @xmath44 even if we do not assume the cosmological constant as dark energy .",
    "next we discuss the case with the time dependent equation of state parameterized as eq .",

    "we discuss to what extent the evolution of dark energy equation of state can affect the determination of @xmath34 and @xmath35 when we do not assume a flat universe . in fig .",
    "[ fig : om_ox_w01marg ] , the contours of 1@xmath36 and 2@xmath36 constraints are shown as the same manner as fig .  [",

    ", the allowed regions get larger compared to the case with the constant equation of state discussed above ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : om_ox_wmarg ] ) . as for the constraint from the baryon acoustic oscillation peak and the cmb shift parameter , the allowed regions are almost the same as the case with a constant equation of state . for observations which measure a single distance scale ,",
    "the fit to the data does not significantly become better , even if the time evolution of @xmath0 is allowed , due to the degeneracy between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , when we use all three different observations together , the allowed region becomes almost the same as that of the case with a constant equation of state .",
    "this is because each observation favors different values of @xmath0 .",
    "even if we consider the time - varying equation of state , different combinations of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are chosen to minimize the value of @xmath41 for each observation .",
    "thus the allowed region from the combined data set is almost unchanged although the constraints from a single observation , in particular from sneia , can become weaker .    here",
    "we comment on the effect of the prior on @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "although the constraints from a single data alone somewhat depend on the prior , the allowed region for all data combined is almost unaffected since the combinations of @xmath45 and @xmath46 favored around the allowed region from all data sets are far from the the edge of the prior we assumed .",

    "although the allowed region of @xmath45 extends to larger values , @xmath34 is constrained to be @xmath50 which is the almost same as the case with assuming a constant equation of state .",

    "as in the previous cases , using each observational data alone , the allowed region becomes significantly larger compared to those with constant equation of state and a flat universe .",

    "in particular , we can obtain the constraint such that @xmath50 without assuming a flat universe . moreover",

    "in this section , we consider the constraints on the time dependence of dark energy equation of state , i.e. , on @xmath45 and @xmath46 without assuming the prior of a flat universe .",
    "however first we discuss the case with a flat universe for the later comparison with the case where a flat universe is not assumed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : w0_w1_flat ] , contours of 1@xmath36 and 2@xmath36 allowed regions are shown for the case with a flat universe . here",
    "we fix the energy density of matter as @xmath54 .",
    "notice that we do not consider the region where @xmath55 in order not to include the possibilities of early - time dark energy domination . as we can see from the figure ,",
    "the constraint from sneia is stringent compared to baryon acoustic oscillation peak and cmb . since the position of the baryon acoustic oscillation peak measures a single distance scale from @xmath56 to @xmath57 and the cmb shift parameter also gives a single scale from @xmath56 to @xmath58 , there is strong degeneracy among the parameters which describe the equation of state for dark energy .",
    "notice that the distance scales are determined by the integration of the inverse of the hubble parameter , which can smear out the information on the time dependence of the equation of state .",
    "this is the reason why the strong degeneracy exists when only a single scale is considered .",
    "however , as for sneia data , the degeneracy is removed to some extent since we have the distances from @xmath56 to various redshifts .",
    "thus observations of sneia can mainly constrain the time dependence of the equation of state for dark energy .",
    "next we show the constraints on @xmath45 and @xmath46 in a flat universe without assuming a particular value for @xmath34 . to obtain the constraint , we marginalized over @xmath34 with the prior @xmath59 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : w0_w1_flat_ommarg ] , we show the constraints on @xmath45 and @xmath46 from sneia ( a ) and all data combined ( b ) .",

    "also in this case , such severe degeneracies among the parameters exist because those observations measure a single distance scale . as in the previous case ,",
    "when we include all data sets in the analysis , we can obtain almost the same constraint as that with @xmath34 being fixed to @xmath60 .",
    "this is partly because the best fit value of @xmath34 is near @xmath60 when we marginalized over it , but also because the values of @xmath34 minimizing @xmath41 for each observational data set are different . to see this , in fig .",
    "[ fig : w0_w1_flat_ommarg_minom ] , we show contours of constant @xmath34 which minimize @xmath41 when we marginalize over @xmath34 for the constraints from sneia ( a ) , the baryon acoustic oscillation peak ( b ) , the cmb shift parameter ( c ) and all data combined ( d ) . as is clear from the figure , preferred values of @xmath34 for each observation are quite different .",
    "thus when all data are used , we can obtain a severe constraint although a single observation can not constrain the equation of state for dark energy .",

    "we only report here the constraint from sneia ( a ) and that from all data combined ( b ) since the baryon acoustic oscillation peak and the cmb shift parameter can not give meaningful constraints on this plane in this case too .",
    "as we can see , when we consider the constraint from all data sets , it significantly becomes severe compared to that from sneia alone as seen from the figure .",
    "this is because the favored values of @xmath34 and @xmath51 from each data set are different as in the previous cases .",
