    "that is , one has to run the markov chain until the cutoff point in order for it to even slightly mix , and yet running it any further would be essentially redundant .",

    "the focus of this paper is on random walks on a random regular graph , namely on @xmath44 , a graph uniformly distributed over the set of all @xmath1-regular graphs on @xmath2 vertices , for @xmath3 and @xmath2 large .",
    "this important class of random graphs has been extensively studied , among other reasons due to the remarkable expansion properties of its typical instance .",
    "one useful implication of these expansion properties is the rapid mixing of the corresponding _ simple random walk _ ( ) , the chain whose states are the vertices of the graph , and moves at each step to a uniformly chosen neighbor .",
    "namely , the  on such a graph has a mixing time of @xmath4 _ with high probability _ ( @xmath5 ) , that is , with probability tending to @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",

    ". then @xmath5 , the _ simple _ random walk on @xmath50 exhibits cutoff at @xmath9 with a window of order @xmath10 . furthermore , for any fixed @xmath51 , the worst case total - variation mixing time @xmath5  satisfies @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the c.d.f . of the standard normal .",
    "the essence of the cutoff for the  on a typical @xmath55 lies in the behavior of its counterpart , the non - backtracking random walk ( ) , that does not traverse the same edge twice in a row ( formally defined soon ) .",
    "curiously , this chain also exhibits cutoff on @xmath0 @xmath5 , only this time the cutoff window is _ constant _ : holds for @xmath56 and @xmath57 logarithmic in @xmath58 :    [ thm - nbrw]let @xmath48 be a random regular graph for @xmath49 fixed .",

    "the height of a , started at the root , is analogous to a biased @xmath45-dimensional random walk with speed @xmath65 .",
    "hence , the time it takes this walk to reach height @xmath11 is concentrated around @xmath66 with a standard deviation of order @xmath10 .",
    "our results establish that at this time , the walk on @xmath0 is mixed .",
    "one of the keys to showing this is estimating the number of simple paths of length just beyond @xmath67 between most pairs of vertices ( see lemma  [ lem - k - roots - intersections ] for a more precise statement ) . in comparison , as the  started at the root of a tree is forbidden from backtracking up , it reaches height @xmath11 after precisely @xmath11 steps , hence the sharper cutoff window .    establishing the above theorems",
    "requires a careful analysis of the local geometry around typical pairs of vertices , via a poissonization argument .",
    "namely , we show that the number of edges between certain neighborhoods of two prescribed vertices is roughly poisson .",
    "similar arguments then allow us to formulate analogous results for the case of regular graphs of high degree , that is , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is allowed to tend to @xmath68 with @xmath2 , up to @xmath69 .      the cutoff phenomenon was first identified for the case of random transpositions on the symmetric group in @xcite , and for the case of the riffle - shuffle and random walks on the hypercube in @xcite . in their seminal paper @xcite from 1985 , aldous and diaconis established cutoff ( and coined the term ) for the top - in - at - random card shuffling process .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more on the cutoff phenomenon , as well as @xcite for a survey of this phenomenon for random walks on finite groups .",
    "unfortunately , there are relatively few examples where cutoff has been rigorously shown , whereas many important chains are conjectured to exhibit cutoff .",
    "indeed , merely deciding whether a given family of finite markov chains exhibits cutoff or not ( without pinpointing the precise cutoff location ) can already be a formidable task ( see @xcite for more on this problem ) .    in 2004 , peres @xcite proposed the condition @xmath70 as a cutoff criterion , where @xmath71 is the spectral gap of the chain ( i.e. , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the largest nontrivial eigenvalue of the transition kernel ) . while this `` product - condition '' is indeed necessary for cutoff in a family of reversible chains , there are known examples where this condition holds yet there is no cutoff ( see @xcite*section 6 ) .",
    "nevertheless , peres conjectured that for many natural chains the product - condition does imply total - variation cutoff ( e.g. , this was recently verified in @xcite for the class of birth - and - death chains )",
    ".    an important family of chains , mentioned in this context in @xcite , is s on transitive `` expander '' graphs of fixed degree @xmath1 ( graphs where the second eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix is bounded away from @xmath1 ) .",
    "chen and saloff - coste @xcite verified that such chains exhibit cutoff when measuring the convergence to equilibrium via other ( less common ) norms , and mentioned the remaining open problem of proving total - variation cutoff .    on the other hand , it is well known that almost every @xmath1-regular graph for @xmath3 is an expander ( see @xcite , and also @xcite for an analogous statement under a closely related combinatorial definition of expansion ) .",
    "in fact , it was shown by friedman @xcite that the second eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of @xmath55 for @xmath3 is @xmath5  @xmath74 , essentially as far from @xmath1 as possible . thus ,",
    "random regular graphs are a valuable tool for constructing sparse expander graphs , and furthermore , for any fixed @xmath3 , any statement that holds @xmath5  for @xmath0 also holds for almost every @xmath1-regular expander .",
    "see , @xcite,@xcite and also @xcite for more on the thoroughly studied model @xmath0 .    by the above",
    ", it follows that for any fixed @xmath8 , the mixing time of the  on @xmath75 is typically @xmath4 , whereas its @xmath71 is bounded away from @xmath15 . hence ,",
    "if we consider the  on graphs @xmath76 for some fixed @xmath8 , then the product - condition typically holds , and according to the above conjecture of peres , these chains should exhibit cutoff @xmath5 .",
    "a special case of this was conjectured by durrett , following his work with berestycki @xcite studying the  on a random @xmath6-regular graph @xmath77 .",
    "they showed that at time @xmath78 the distance of the walk from its starting point is asymptotically @xmath79 .",
    "this implies a lower bound of @xmath80 for the asymptotic mixing time of random @xmath6-regular graphs , and in particular , an asymptotic lower bound of @xmath81 for the _ lazy _ random walk ( the lazy version of a chain with transition kernel @xmath82 is the chain whose transition kernel is @xmath83 , i.e. , in each step it stays in place with probability @xmath84 , and otherwise it follows the rule of the original chain ) . in @xcite , durrett conjectured that this latter bound is tight :    the mixing time for the lazy random walk on the random @xmath6-regular graph is asymptotically @xmath81 .    theorem [ thm - rw ] stated above confirms these conjectures of peres and durrett ( one can readily infer an upper bound on the mixing time of the lazy random walk from theorem  [ thm - rw ] ) .",
    "not only does this theorem establish cutoff and its location for the  on @xmath0 ( an analogous result immediately holds for the lazy walk ) , but it also determines the second order term in @xmath85 for any @xmath51 ( the term corresponding to the cutoff window of order @xmath10 ) .    the  on @xmath0 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 fixed , starting from @xmath88 ( not worst - case ) , was studied by hildebrand @xcite .",
    "he showed that in this case there is cutoff @xmath5  at @xmath89 , and asked whether this also holds for @xmath90 . as we soon show , the answer to this question is positive , even from worst - case starting point and after replacing the @xmath91 by an additive @xmath92 . to describe this result",
    ", we must first discuss the  in further detail .      while the  of a graph is a markov chain on its vertices ,",
    "the  has the set of directed edges ( i.e. , each edge appears in both orientations ) as its state space : it moves from an edge @xmath93 to a uniformly chosen edge @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "however , in most applications for s on regular graphs ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) , one often considers the projection of this chain onto the currently visited vertex ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) , as it also converges to the uniform distribution on the vertices , and can thus be compared to the .",
    "in @xcite the authors compare the  and this projection of the  on regular expander graphs , showing that the  has a faster _ mixing rate _ ( see @xcite for the definition of this spectral parameter , which for the  coincides with the largest nontrivial eigenvalue in absolute value ) .",
    "however , it was not clear how this spectral data actually translates into a direct comparison of the corresponding mixing times .",
    "theorems [ thm - rw ] and [ thm - nbrw ] , as a bi - product , enable us to directly compare the mixing times of the  and  ( not only its projection onto the vertices ) .",
    "namely , we obtain that the  indeed _ mixes faster _ than the  on almost every @xmath1-regular graph , by a factor of @xmath97 .",
    "surprisingly , the delicate result stated in theorem [ thm - nbrw ] also shows that once we omit the `` noise '' created by the backtracking possibility of the , we are able to pinpoint the cutoff location up to @xmath14 ( see @xcite for an example of such an @xmath14 cutoff window related to random walks on the symmetric group ) .    recalling that the cutoff window in theorem [ thm - nbrw ] had the form @xmath98 , one may wonder what the effect of large degrees would be .",
    "our results extend to the case of large @xmath1 , all the way up to @xmath13 , beyond which the mixing time is constant ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) hence there is no point in discussing cutoff .",
    "the cutoff window indeed _ vanishes _ as @xmath99 , and the entire mixing transition occurs within merely two steps of the chain :    [ thm - nbrw - large - d ] let @xmath48 where @xmath13 tends to @xmath68 with @xmath2",

    "on @xmath50 has cutoff @xmath5  within two steps of the chain .",
    "as a corollary , the relation between s and s directly implies an analogous statement for the  on regular graphs of large degree . here , the cutoff window becomes @xmath102 ( compared to @xmath10 for @xmath1 fixed ) , and if @xmath103 then the walk completely coincides with the .",

    "furthermore , if @xmath105 , then for any fixed @xmath100 , the worst case total - variation mixing time of the _ _ on @xmath50 @xmath5  satisfies @xmath101    in particular , this answers the above question of hildebrand ( the case of @xmath106 for any @xmath107 fixed ) in the affirmative , even from a worst starting position .",
    "furthermore , instead of a multiplicative @xmath108 , the cutoff point is determined up to an additive 2 if @xmath109 .      as mentioned above , one of the original examples of cutoff was for the lazy random walk on the hypercube @xmath110 , which was shown by aldous @xcite to exhibit cutoff at @xmath111 .",
    "when compared to the  on @xmath112 , guaranteed by corollary  [ cor - rw - large - d ] to have cutoff @xmath5  at @xmath113 ( in this setting , @xmath114 has @xmath115 ) , this demonstrates the slower than typical mixing of the hypercube .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : prelim ] contains several preliminary facts on random regular graphs . in sections  [ sec : rw ] and [ sec :",
    "nbrw ] we prove the main theorems , theorems  [ thm - rw ] and [ thm - nbrw ] resp . , and in section  [ sec : large - d ] we extend these proofs to the case of @xmath1 large .",
    "let @xmath116 , and let @xmath117 denote the set of directed edges ( i.e. , @xmath117 contains both orientations of every edge in @xmath118 ) . throughout the paper , we will use @xmath119 for vertices in @xmath120 , as opposed to @xmath121 for directed edges in @xmath117 .",
    "this model , introduced by bollobs @xcite and sometimes also referred to as the _ pairing model _ , provides a convenient method of both constructing and analyzing a random regular graph .",
    "we next briefly review some of the properties of this model which we will need for our arguments ( see @xcite,@xcite and @xcite*section 2 for further information ) .    given @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath122 even , a @xmath1-regular ( multi-)graph on @xmath2 vertices is constructed via the configuration model as follows .",
    "each vertex is identified with @xmath1 distinct points , and a random perfect matching of all these @xmath123 points is then produced .",
    "the resulting multi - graph is obtained by collapsing every @xmath1-tuple into its corresponding vertex ( possibly introducing loops or multiple edges ) .",
    "let @xmath124  denote the event that the outcome is a simple graph .",
    "it can easily be verified that , on the event @xmath124 , the resulting graph is uniformly distributed over @xmath0 .",
    "crucially , for any fixed @xmath1 , @xmath125 where the @xmath91-term tends to @xmath15 as @xmath46 . in particular",
    ", as this probability is uniformly bounded away from @xmath15 , any event that holds @xmath5  for multi - graphs constructed via the configuration model , also holds @xmath5  for @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the statement in equation was extended to any @xmath126 by mckay @xcite .",
    "although the asymptotical behavior of this probability was thereafter determined for even larger values of @xmath1 ( see @xcite for additional information ) , in this work we are only concerned with the case @xmath13 , and hence this result will suffice for our purposes .",
    "a highly useful property of the configuration model is the following : we can expose the `` pairings '' sequentially , that is , given a vertex , we reveal the @xmath1 neighbors of its corresponding points one by one , and so on .",
    "this allows us to `` explore our way '' into the graph , while constantly maintaining the uniform distribution over the pairings of the remaining unmatched points .",
    "we need the following definitions with respect to a given graph @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath127 denote the distance between two vertices @xmath128 in this graph . for any vertex @xmath129 and integer @xmath20 ,",

    "the _ tree excess _ of @xmath134 , denoted by @xmath135 , is the maximum number of edges that can be deleted from the induced subgraph on @xmath134 while keeping it connected ( i.e. , the number of extra edges in that induced subgraph beyond @xmath136 ) .",
    "the next lemma demonstrates the well known locally - tree - like properties of a typical @xmath55 for any fixed @xmath8 .",

    "choose @xmath140 uniformly at random , and consider the process where the neighborhood of @xmath130 is sequentially exposed level by level , according to the configuration model .",
    "when pairing the vertices of level @xmath141 ( and establishing level @xmath142 ) for some @xmath143 , we are matching @xmath144 points among a pool of @xmath145 yet unpaired points . for @xmath146 ,",
    "let @xmath147 denote the @xmath148-field generated by the process of sequentially exposing pairings up to the @xmath149-th unmatched point in @xmath150 .",
    "further let @xmath151 denote the event that the newly exposed pair of the @xmath149-th unmatched point in @xmath150 already belongs to some vertex in @xmath152 . clearly , @xmath153 ( where the last inequality holds for a sufficiently large @xmath2 ) , and hence the number of events @xmath154 that occur is stochastically dominated by a binomial random variable with parameters @xmath155 .",
    "( we say that @xmath156 stochastically dominates @xmath157 , denoted by @xmath158 , if @xmath159 for every bounded increasing function @xmath160 . )",
