    "experimental investigations of fluctuations of conserved charges , expressed as cumulants of net - particle multiplicity distributions , probe the response of the system to external perturbations .",
    "for example , the liquid gas phase transition can be probed by the response of the volume to a change in pressure , which is encoded in the isothermal compressibility .",
    "such measurements are hence particularly interesting for studies of possible critical phenomena and the existence of a critical endpoint in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite . to make any quantitative headway the objective is to isolate , in the experimental data , the dynamical part of the fluctuations and compare the corresponding cumulants to those from predictions for a thermal system as obtained by calculations within the framework of lattice gauge theory or other dynamical theories .",
    "indeed , for a thermal system of volume @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 , within the grand canonical ensemble , fluctuations of a given net - charge @xmath2 are related to the corresponding reduced susceptibility @xmath3  @xcite :    @xmath4    with @xmath3 defined as the second derivative of the reduced thermodynamic pressure @xmath5 with respect to the corresponding reduced chemical potential @xmath6    @xmath7    in a similar way , higher order cumulants are related to the corresponding higher order susceptibilities  @xcite .",
    "this means that the response function of the system to external parameters can be obtained from thermal averages of macroscopic variables by employing the probability distribution of micro - states of the system .",
    "furthermore , in order to get rid of not directly measurable quantities such as volume and temperature , which enter into eq .",
    "[ cumulants ] , it is advocated in  @xcite to look for ratios of cumulants . however , a comment is in order here : eq .",
    "[ cumulants ] is derived under the assumption that the volume of the system is fixed . within the wounded nucleon model",
    "this means that the number of participants is fixed in each event . in experiments , however , events are classified into centrality bins . in most theoretical approaches ,",
    "centrality is specified using the collision impact parameter ; zero for central collisions , and close to the sum of the radii of the colliding nuclei for peripheral collisions .",
    "more specifically , one can define a centrality window incorporating the @xmath8 most central collisions .",
    "experimentally , however , one does not have direct access to the impact parameter , hence the centrality classes are typically defined as windows of energy deposited in a zero - degree calorimeter , the number of participants , the multiplicity of charged particles produced in a given acceptance , etc .",
    "for the analysis of average quantities it is often not critical which of the centrality determination approaches are used , because all of them give similar results for such physical quantities .",
    "however , the situation changes dramatically if one considers event - by - event fluctuations of these quantities . in this case",
    ", the centrality determination details become crucial and differently influence the magnitude of measurements of moments such as described in eq .",
    "[ cumulants ] .",
    "it is , therefore , important to subtract from experimentally measured cumulants the contributions originating from the fluctuations in the number of wounded nucleons .",
    "one should also note that fluctuation signals of conserved quantities such as the net - baryon number need to be studied in a restricted phase space  @xcite .",
    "otherwise there are no fluctuations .",
    "this is achieved by placing appropriate cuts in rapidity and/or transverse momentum of the detected particles . by construction ,",
    "the smaller the acceptance the smaller the effect of global conservation laws .",
    "however , a too small acceptance may also destroy the fluctuations of interest if the acceptance window is less than the intrinsic dynamical correlation length @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this issue becomes more and more important as one approaches a critical endpoint in the qcd phase diagram , where the correlation length becomes large  .",
    "clearly there , one should not select a too small acceptance window . at low center - of - mass energies of @xmath10 gev ( corresponding to top sps energy )",
    "the ( pseudo)rapidity width of the distribution of produced baryons @xmath11 becomes smaller than the typical correlation length @xmath12 ( both expressed in terms of standard deviations ) even if there is no critical endpoint nearby , and effects of baryon number conservation are expected to become dominant .    in this paper",
    "we address both of the effects mentioned above . by simulating the actually used centrality selection criteria in the alice experiment at the cern lhc and the star experiment at the bnl rhic",
    ", we provide a framework to study the effects of participant fluctuations on measured cumulants of any order and provide numerical estimates on cumulants up to the order of four .",
    "likewise , we give simple but quantitative estimates of the corrections due to baryon number conservation on measured cumulants .",
    "we would like to mention that the contributions of participant or volume fluctuations to dynamical event - by - event fluctuation signals have been investigated previously in different contexts  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the authors of  @xcite studied the effects of volume fluctuations on susceptibilities . however , none of the previous studies have employed a detailed implementation of the experimentally used centrality measures , a crucial ingredient of our approach .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way : first we collect and summarize the notations and definitions used to compute cumulants .",
    "the next two sections deal with participant or volume fluctuations and the description of a simple model in which the effects of participant fluctuations can be quantitatively simulated .",
    "we apply these considerations in the following sections first to data from the alice experiment at the lhc , followed by applications to selected star data from the rhic beam energy scan ( bes ) .",
    "next we discuss how to correct cumulant data for the effect of global conservation laws . in the final section we provide a conclusion and outlook .",
    "in the following we choose the notations as used e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 central moment of a discrete random variable @xmath14 , with its probability distribution @xmath15 , is generally defined as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 denotes the mean of the distribution    @xmath18    in a similar way we introduce moments about the origin , thereafter referred to as raw moments    @xmath19    furthermore , to avoid particular units we introduce dimensionless moment ratios    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the variance defined by    @xmath22    for @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ moments_ratios ] ) yields the skewness of the distribution    @xmath24    the quantity skewness is a way to describe the asymmetry of a particular distribution .",
    "the distribution is said to have positive skewness if it has a longer tail to values larger ( to the right ) than the central maximum compared to the left ones .",
    "if the reverse is true the skewness is negative . on the other hand ,",
    "the skewness is zero if the data are symmetrically distributed about the mean .",
    "the kurtosis of the distribution of @xmath14 is obtained by taking @xmath25 = 4 in eq .",
    "( [ moments_ratios ] ) ,    @xmath26    the kurtosis is the degree of peakedness of the distribution , usually taken relative to a normal distribution . since , for a normal distribution , the value of the kurtosis is 3 , it is usual to redefine it as    @xmath27    which is generally referred to as kurtosis ( sometimes it is called kurtosis excess ) .",
    "positive values of @xmath28 imply a relatively narrower peak and wider wings than the normal distribution with the same mean and variance , while negative @xmath28 values imply a wider peak and narrower wings .",
    "the cumulants of @xmath14 are defined as the coefficients in the maclaurin series of the logarithm of the characteristic function of @xmath14 .",
    "the first four cumulants read @xmath29 from eqs .",
    "( [ skew_definition ] ) ,  ( [ kurtosis_definition2 ] ) and  ( [ kumulants_definition ] ) we obtain the following relations which are widely used in fluctuation analyses of conserved charges :    @xmath30    and    @xmath31    finally , for the poisson distribution , all its cumulants are equal to its mean . the probability distribution of the difference @xmath32 - @xmath33 of two random variables , each generated from statistically independent poisson distributions , is called the skellam distribution . according to the additivity of cumulants , the cumulants of the skellam distribution",
    "will then be    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are mean values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "experimentally measured dynamical event - by - event fluctuation signals such as cumulants of net - particle distributions can , as we will demonstrate quantitatively below , be considerably modified by the fluctuations of the target and projectile participants for a given centrality selection . in this section",
    "we will study the fluctuations of participants within the framework of the wounded nucleon model ( wnm )  @xcite .",
    "we note that , in the wnm , particles are produced from independent exited states of the nucleons ( thereafter referred to as sources , wounded nucleons , participants or mini - fireballs ) .",
    "each source can produce a number of particles , however there are no correlations between different sources . both particles and antiparticles",
    "are produced from each source with the same probability distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ , all sources are statistically identical .",
    "we introduce the moment generating function for the net particle @xmath37 distributions from each source @xmath38 , the exact expression of which is irrelevant for our studies . here",
    "@xmath39 is an auxiliary parameter , which is set to zero after taking corresponding derivatives with respect to it .",

    "it is then straightforward to calculate any moments of the @xmath42 distribution .",
    "for example , for the first and the second raw moment we obtain    @xmath45_{t=0 } = \\left[n_{w}\\left[m_{\\delta n}(t)\\right]^{n_{w}-1}\\frac{dm_{\\delta n}(t)}{dt}\\right]_{t=0 } = n_{w}\\left<\\delta n\\right > \\label{wnm_3}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath46_{t=0 }   = n_{w}\\left(n_{w}-1\\right)\\left<\\delta n\\right>^{2}+n_{w}\\left<\\delta n^{2}\\right > , \\label{wnm_4}\\ ] ]    where the index @xmath47 refers to the fixed number of @xmath44 and by definition @xmath48 .    for a fluctuating number of wounded nucleons an additional summation over the probability distribution of wounded nucleons @xmath49",
    "is needed    @xmath50    and    @xmath51    in a similar way any higher moments can be calculated . finally , substituting the",
    "so obtained raw moments into the above definitions of cumulants ( cf .",
    ".  [ kumulants_definition ] ) we get the following expressions for the first four cumulants    @xmath52 here , @xmath37 is the number of net - particles from a single source .",
    "we note that the corresponding cumulants for particles can be obtained by replacing @xmath42 and @xmath53 in eqs .",
    "[ cum1]-  [ cum4 ] with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . in the same way the cumulants for antiparticles are obtained .    as can be seen from the above equations , starting from the second",

    "this particular case is then indeed equivalent to eq .",
    "[ cumulants ] .",
    "this assumption is , however , not applicable for a description of relativistic nuclear collisions , as mentioned above .",
    "interestingly , for lhc energies , fluctuations of @xmath44 are irrelevant for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this is because in eqs .",
    "[ cum2 ] and  [ cum3 ] the participant fluctuation part scales with the mean number of net - particles @xmath62 and its powers , which vanish for lhc energies at mid - rapidity .",
    "this , however , does not hold for @xmath63 and all higher even cumulants . indeed , taking @xmath64 in eq .",
    "[ cum4 ] we get @xmath65 .",
    "nevertheless , for the fourth and higher even cumulants the situation is much more favourable at lhc because some contributions from higher cumulants of @xmath44 drop in these cases , too .",
    "in this section we develop a model to simulate the effects of participant or volume fluctuations in the experimental environment and compare obtained results with the equations derived in the previous section .",
    "an important advantage of this approach is that it allows a precise determination of the statistics needed for a particular cumulant measurement , which is of crucial importance for the preparation of an event - by - event experiment .",
    "further input from experimental data is necessary for a successful analysis : ( i ) a detailed description of the centrality selection procedure employed in a particular experiment , and ( ii ) measurements of the first moments ( mean multiplicities ) of particles and antiparticles .    as the centrality determination is a delicate experimental issue ( cf .",
    "the discussion in the introduction ) , each experiment has to be considered separately .",
    "below we implement one of the centrality selection approaches used in the alice experiment , where the measured multiplicities ( signal amplitudes in vzeros ) are fitted with those obtained from a glauber monte carlo simulation ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "technically , following a two - component model  @xcite , in which one decomposes nucleus - nucleus collisions into soft and hard interactions , we first calculate the number of ancestors    @xmath66    where @xmath44 and @xmath67 are the number of wounded nucleons and binary collisions , simulated in each glauber monte carlo event for a given value of the impact parameter  @xcite and @xmath68 is taken from  @xcite .",
    "next , from each ancestor we generate particles from a negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) , defined by the probability distribution    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the mean multiplicity of particles emitted from each ancestor and @xmath71 controls the width of the nbd .",
    "numerical values of the parameters , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are taken from the alice paper  @xcite .",

    "[ cent1 ] , respectively .",

    "[ cent1 ] , where each dot represents one single event , the impact parameter as well as the number of wounded nucleons fluctuate from event - to - event , thus generating a distribution . to demonstrate this explicitly we present , in fig .",
    "[ cent2 ] , distributions of wounded nucleons for 3 different centrality classes .    for the @xmath75 most central collisions",
    "we observe that the distribution is asymmetric and has a tail towards lower values of wounded nucleons .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the number of wounded nucleons can not exceed two times the mass number of the colliding nuclei , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath76 , in the case of @xmath77 collisions . as a consequence ,",
    "higher cumulants of the distribution of wounded nucleons acquire large values for this centrality bin .",
    "this , in turn , distorts the experimentally measured cumulants of both particles and net - particles .",

    "[ norm_cum ] .    protons and antiprotons",

    "the mean values of protons and antiprotons , which define the corresponding poisson distributions , are taken from the alice measurements in @xmath77 collisions at @xmath80 tev  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the first moment of the net - proton distribution vanishes , hence we take the same mean number of antiprotons and protons , which is quantitatively supported by both experimental measurements  @xcite and hadron resonance gas model analysis , see @xcite .",

    "[ k4 ] fourth cumulants of protons are presented .",
    "for the first centrality bin ( 0 - 5@xmath87 ) we observe rather small difference between red and black symbols .",

    "the requirements of gce have to be achieved in experiments .",
    "this is typically done by analysing the experimental data in the finite acceptance by imposing cuts on rapidity and/or mean transverse momentum of detected particles . however , if the selected acceptance window is too small , the possible dynamical correlations we are after will also be strongly reduced  @xcite and consequently , net baryons will be distributed according to the difference of two independent poisson distributions , the skellam distribution .",
    "this statement is analytically proven below . on the other hand , by enlarging the acceptance , in order to catch dynamical fluctuations , correlations due to baryon number conservation will be significant .",
    "the aim of this section is to estimate the contribution from the conservation laws and subtract it from the measured fluctuation signals .    in order to get a quantitative estimate for what means `` large '' acceptance we will model the finite acceptance with the binomial distribution .",
    "we first define the acceptance factor for baryons as the ratio of mean number of detected baryons @xmath98 to the number of baryons in the full phase space @xmath99 :    @xmath100    furthermore , we assume the same acceptance factor for anti - baryons . given the number of baryons @xmath54 in the full phase space , the probability of measuring @xmath55 baryons in the acceptance is    @xmath101    if the number of baryons in @xmath102 are distributed according to some probability distribution @xmath103 the corresponding multiplicity distribution in the acceptance will then be    @xmath104    the moments of the measured baryon distributions can be then calculated    @xmath105    @xmath106    in a similar way corresponding moments for the anti - baryons can be derived :    @xmath107    @xmath108    finally , the mixed moment of baryons and anti - baryons are obtained    @xmath109    the second cumulant of net baryons inside the acceptance can be written as    @xmath110    using eqs .  [ binomial1]-[binomial5 ] in eq .",
    "[ secondcumacceptance ] we obtain    @xmath111    here @xmath112 refers to the second cumulant of the skellam distribution , which , according to eq .",
    "[ skellam_definition ] is equal to @xmath113 .",
    "[ conserv1 ] leads to    @xmath114    because net - baryons do not fluctuate in @xmath102 , _",
    "i.e _ , @xmath115 in eq .",
    "[ conserv1 ] vanishes .",
    "[ conserv2 ] shows that fluctuations of net - baryons inside the acceptance will be modified due to the baryon number conservation .",
    "moreover , the modification depends only on the acceptance factor @xmath116 , defined in eq .",
    "[ accdef ] .",
    "we first examine a number of useful properties of eqs .",
    "[ conserv1 ] and  [ conserv2 ] .",
    "when @xmath116 approaches zero the eq .",
    "[ conserv2 ] converges to unity .",
    "this means that , in a small acceptance , net - baryon distributions can be described with the skellam probabilities . on the other hand , with increasing @xmath116 , the fluctuations of net - baryons decrease because of the increasingly significant effect of overall baryon number conservation , and eventually vanish when @xmath116 becomes 1 .",
    "moreover , from eq .",
    "[ conserv1 ] it is evident that , if in a larger acceptance the net - baryon fluctuations follow the skellam distribution , then in any smaller acceptance the multiplicities will also be distributed according to the skellam distribution .",
    "indeed , in this case @xmath117 which leads to @xmath118 .",
    "the latter is important and once again underlines the importance of large acceptance .    experiments typically report on net - proton cumulants which are used as a proxy for the net - baryons .",
    "the validity of this assumption is fulfilled at the lhc energies  @xcite . in order to correct net proton distributions for the baryon number conservation eq .",
    "[ conserv2 ] can still be employed by redefining the the @xmath116 ( see eq .",
    "[ accdef ] ) parameter as    @xmath119    where , @xmath120 refers to the mean number of protons inside the acceptance .",
    "in summary , we studied non - dynamical contributions to fluctuations of net - protons within the wounded nucleon model .",
    "since the impact parameter is not measurable in a nuclear collision such fluctuations of participants can not be avoided experimentally . to study their impact",
    ", we developed a monte carlo method to describe realistically the centrality dependence of the collision geometry and its influence on higher moments of net - baryon distributions . to this end",
    "we provide analytic relations between net - particle and wounded nucleon cumulants for any cumulant order .",
    "furthermore , we discuss a procedure for selecting an optimal acceptance for fluctuation measurements .",
    "the results of our studies exhibit a strong centrality and energy dependence for these non - dynamical fluctuations .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is very significant , exceeding the fluctuations computed for a non - interacting hadron resonance gas by more than a factor of 2 . only for the case of vanishing mean values of net - protons ,",
    "as observed at mid - rapidity for lhc energies , their second and third cumulants are found to be independent of participant fluctuations , while higher even moments are significantly affected . at lower energies ,",
    "where the mean numbers of protons and antiprotons are different , the second and all higher cumulants depend strongly on fluctuations of wounded nucleons ( or participants ) .",
    "the simplest way to use our approach in the interpretation of experimental data is to start from a particular theoretical prediction and fold the results with our calculations for fluctuations of participants and conservation of net - baryon number before any detailed comparison with experiment .",
    "a more ambitious and ultimately necessary program would be to unfold experimental data in the inverse approach .",
    "this will require a very detailed understanding of experimental resolutions and efficiencies .",
    "the effects we have observed , in particular for higher than 2nd cumulants , are so significant at all beam energies that their inclusion into analysis procedures seem mandatory before quantitative physics conclusions from fluctuation data can be obtained .",
