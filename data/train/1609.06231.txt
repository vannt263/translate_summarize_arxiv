    "we have observed more matter than antimatter in our daily lives , e.g. , more protons than antiprotons , more electrons than positrons , and more hydrogen than anti - hydrogen .",
    "the list can go on and on .",
    "indeed , experimentalists have also observed more matter than anti - matter in cosmic ray experiments .",
    "such an asymmetry is known as matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "charge - parity ( @xmath0 ) violation is one of the key ingredients to the understanding of the evolution in the early universe why we have observed more matter than antimatter nowadays .",
    "@xmath0 violation was first observed in the kaon system in early 60 s @xcite .",
    "it was only evident until early 2000 that @xmath0 violation was observed in the @xmath7-meson system @xcite .",
    "both kaon and @xmath7-meson @xmath0 violation data can be accommodated by the so - called kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) mixing matrix in the quark sector @xcite within the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is well - known that the amount of @xmath0 violation allowed by the sm is not large enough to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "further sources of @xmath0 violations are hot topics for physics beyond the sm .",
    "recently , the t2k experiment reported measurements of appearance rates for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and they found that they indeed have different rates .",
    "thus , it is a hint of @xmath0 violation and thus resulting in nonzero values for the @xmath0-odd phase @xmath1 .",
    "the data preferred maximal @xmath10 mixing , @xmath11 ( or equivalently @xmath3 ) , and normal mass hierarchy ( nh ) over the inverted mass hierarchy ( ih ) @xcite . the fitted range for @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 \\;\\;({\\rm nh } ) , \\qquad   \\delta_{cp } = \\left [   - 2.09 , - 0.74   \\right ] \\;\\ ; ( { \\rm ih})\\ ] ] at 90% cl , with the best fit at around @xmath14 ( or equivalently @xmath3 ) . also , the experiment claimed a 90%cl exclusion of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this is consistent with the most recent global analysis of neutrino oscillation data @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the radiative neutrino - mass model , due to krauss , nasri , and trodden ( knt ) @xcite , can accommodate the @xmath0-odd phase with the choice of the complex @xmath4 parameters .",
    "the knt model generates tiny neutrino masses based on a 3-loop diagram with right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos at tev scale and a @xmath17 symmetry to avoid the type - i see - saw mass .",
    "it was also shown that the tev scale rh neutrinos can be the dark matter candidate and searchable at the future linear colliders @xcite .",
    "we shall extend the model by employing three rh neutrinos and complex @xmath4 parameters , so that we can satisfy not only neutrino oscillation data and dark matter constraints , but also the lepton - flavor violations , as well as favors a nonzero @xmath0-odd phase .",
    "the whole setup is consistent with neutrino oscillation data , lepton - flavor violations , @xmath5-@xmath6 conversion , and dark matter constraints .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the knt model with 3 rh neutrinos and the neutrino mass matrix , as well as the constraints and phenomenology of the model , such as lepton - flavor violations , dark matter , and collider physics .",
    "we also show numerically that the model is consistent with all the data .",
    "section  iii is devoted for conclusions and discussion .",

    "@xcite for linear colliders .",
    "we shall briefly highlight here .",
    "the lightest rh neutrino @xmath25 is the dark matter candidate , while the other rh neutrinos @xmath62 and the charged boson @xmath63 are slightly heavier because of the requirement of coannihilation .    at @xmath64 colliders ,",
    "one can produce @xmath65 followed by the decays of @xmath66 , which gives rise to a final state of a pair of charged leptons ( not necessarily the same flavor ) plus missing energies .",
    "one can also consider the pair production of @xmath67 via @xmath68 .",
    "note that the @xmath69-channel diagram with an exchange of a rh neutrino is suppressed by the mass of the rh neutrino .",
    "the @xmath70 so produced will decay into @xmath71 , and so the final state consists of a pair of charged leptons ( again not necessarily the same flavor ) and missing energies .",
    "the decay of @xmath62 is analogous to the heavier neutralinos @xmath72 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which can then give a pair of charged leptons plus missing energies . on the other hand , the decay of @xmath70 is analogous to the slepton in mssm .",
    "therefore , the limits from @xmath64 colliders mainly come from lep2 , and the limits are roughly @xcite , without taking any assumption on the underlying particle theory , @xmath73    at hadron colliders , the leading order production process is the drell - yan process @xmath74 , followed by the decays of the @xmath75 .",
    "the final state consists of a pair of charged leptons ( again not necessarily of the same flavor ) plus missing energies .",
    "such a signature is possible at the lhc and indeed the final state is similar to the direct production of a chargino pair at the lhc , in which each chargino can decay into the lightest neutralino and a charged lepton .",
    "thus , the final state consists of a pair of charged leptons whose flavors can be different , plus missing energies .",
    "for example , the atlas collaboration has searched for the same and different lepton flavors plus missing energies at the lhc , using the channel @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the best mass limit on the chargino is @xmath77 gev for @xmath78 gev , but for heavier @xmath79 the mass limit for @xmath80 becomes much weaker because of the soft leptons .",

    "[ fig : nums - cp - free ] .",
    "it can be seen that that the coannihilation process with @xmath90 is more crucial than those with @xmath91 in reproducing the correct relic density .",
    "motivated by a recent result of t2k on the @xmath0-odd phase @xmath1 @xcite , we have studied the possibility of accommodating the @xmath0-odd phase @xmath1 in the framework of the krauss - nasri - trodden ( knt ) model supplemented by a total of 3 right - handed neutrinos of mass tev .",
    "we have analyzed the neutrino oscillation data , lepton - flavor violations , and the dm relic density in a coannihilation system including @xmath70 and @xmath92 in the setup , and found the allowed parameter regions that satisfy all the above constraints , in particular the whole setup can easily accommodate the @xmath0-odd phase @xmath1 in the range preferred by the t2k experiment .",

    "2 .   we do not find any allowed parameter space below about 1 tev of the mass @xmath93 of the dm .",
    "3 .   once we satisfy the constraints of @xmath94 processes , the other lfvs such as lepton universality and @xmath95 conversion are automatically satisfied in our framework .",
    "the minimal values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively reach at @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which will be within the search ranges of the future experiment of comet collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the typical scale of the muon @xmath20 is @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 with negative sign , which has negligible effects on the deviation of the experimental @xmath20 value of @xmath103 .",
