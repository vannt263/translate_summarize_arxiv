    "sharpe ratio @xcite has become a `` gold standard '' for measuring performance of hedge funds and other institutional investors ( this note uses the generic term `` portfolio '' ) .",
    "it is sometimes argued that it is applicable only to i.i.d .",
    "gaussian returns , but we will follow a common practice of ignoring such assumptions . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the benchmark return ( such as the risk - free rate ) is zero .",
    "the ( ex post ) _ sharpe ratio _ of a sequence of returns @xmath0 is defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 ( none of our results will be affected if we replace , assuming @xmath3 , @xmath4 by @xmath5 , as in @xcite , ( 6 ) . )",
    "intuitively , the sharpe ratio is the return per unit of risk .",
    "another way of measuring the performance of a portfolio whose sequence of returns is @xmath6 is to see how this sequence of returns would have affected an initial investment of 1 assuming no capital inflows and outflows after the initial investment .",
    "the final capital resulting from this sequence of returns is @xmath7 .",
    "we are interested in conditions under which the following anomaly is possible : the sharpe ratio @xmath8 is large while @xmath9 .",
    "( more generally , if we did not assume zero benchmark returns , we would replace @xmath9 by the condition that in the absence of capital inflows and outflows the returns @xmath6 underperform the benchmark portfolio . )",
    "suppose the return is @xmath10 over @xmath11 periods , and then it is @xmath12 in the @xmath13th period . as @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , making @xmath13 large enough , we can make the sharpe ratio @xmath17 as large as we want , despite losing all the money over the @xmath13 periods .",
    "if we want the sequence of returns to be i.i.d .",
    ", let the return in each period @xmath18 be @xmath10 with probability @xmath19 and @xmath12 with probability @xmath20 , for a large enough @xmath13 . with probability one",
    "the sharpe ratio @xmath21 will tend to a large number as @xmath22 , despite all money being regularly lost .",
    "of course , in this example the returns are far from being gaussian ( strictly speaking , returns can not be gaussian unless they are constant , since they are bounded from below by @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that our examples lead to the same conclusions when the sharpe ration is replaced by the _ sortino ratio _",
    "@xcite @xmath24 , where @xmath25",
    "the examples of the previous section are somewhat unrealistic in that there is a period in which the portfolio loses almost all its money . in this section",

    ", @xmath31 is the best achievable sharpe ratio for sequences of returns that lose money , assuming that none of the returns falls below @xmath32 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath33 , and in the previous section we saw that @xmath34 . in this section",

    "@xmath37 $ ] the slope of @xmath39 is roughly 1 .",
    "we can see that even for a relatively large value of @xmath40 , the sharpe ratio of a losing portfolio never exceeds 0.5 ; according to table  [ tab : f1 ] , @xmath41 ( much less than the conventional threshold of 1 for a good sharpe ratio @xcite ) .",
