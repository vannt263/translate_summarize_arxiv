    "understanding and modeling wind speed statistics is a key for a better understanding of atmospheric turbulence and diffusion and for use in such practical applications as air quality and pollution transport modeling , estimation of wind loads on buildings , prediction of atmospheric or space probe and missile trajectory and wind power analysis . in the context of wind energy production ,",
    "it is necessary to characterize the wind in a planned wind turbine farm location , in order to calculate the optimal cut - in and cut - out speed and the likely power output of a given wind turbine ( drobinski 2012 ) .",
    "this is done using the distribution of wind speed @xmath0 . in particular ,",
    "a key parameter to describe wind power is the average wind power produced by a wind turbine , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the area of the flow , @xmath3 is the density of the fluid , @xmath4 is the coefficient of power of the wind turbine which measures how efficiently the wind turbine converts the energy in the wind into electricity , @xmath5 is the energy pattern , and @xmath6 is the third moment of the distribution . in order to describe the wind energy potential independently of the turbine shapes , observed histograms are fitted to the weibull distribution , defined as follows , @xmath7 , \\label{eq : weibull}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the wind speed , @xmath8 is the shape parameter and @xmath9 is the scale parameter of the distribution . in this case ,",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gamma function .",
    "the weibull distribution is thus an extremely used paradigm to model wind statistics ( e.g. justus et al .",
    "1976 , 1978 , seguro and lambert 2000 , cook 2001 , weisser 2003 , ramrez and carta 2005 ) because it can be easily fit after estimating the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 and it produces analytical expressions for the different moments and the wind power .",
    "however , its use is purely empirical and there is a lack of physical background justifying the use of the weibull distribution to model wind statistics . besides , the validity of the description of wind statistics by a weibull distribution is not clearly established .",
    "therefore , the estimated wind potential might be systematically mis - estimated .    in this paper",
    ", we use meteorological data to show that , in some locations with particularly high wind potential but wind anisotropy , wind statistics _ is not well described _ by the weibull distribution , thus leading to a systematic under - estimation of wind power , up to @xmath15 .",
    "we then provide physical insights for the origin of such a discrepancy . to this end",
    ", we consider wind velocity as a bivariate distribution of the two orthogonal ( _ e.g. _ north - south and east - west ) wind components and we compute it analytically in the simple case of normal distributions .",
    "this allows us to derive a rayleigh - rice super - statistical distribution , which is better suited than the weibull distribution to describe real data in locations where the wind is not isotropic .",
    "finally , we generalize this approach to the case of isotropic wind with non - gaussian wind components , where the weibull distribution better describes the meteorological data .",
    "in this study , we use wind measurements collected between december , 28@xmath16 2006 and march 20@xmath17 2008 at 10  m height from 4 surface weather stations at different locations in france ( fig .  [ fig : topo ] ) . among the 4 stations , 3 are operational weather stations from the french national weather service mto - france and one is the research observatory ( haeffelin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "while the wind components from the 3 operational weather stations are recorded every three hours , the sirta observatory data is recorded every minute .",
    "the sirta observatory is located at palaiseau , 20  km south of paris , france .",
    "the site is in a suburban area .",
    "we use the wind measurements on a tower surrounded by different types of surface , i.e. close and distant forest , buildings and an open field sector ( drobinski et al .",
    "2006 , barthlott et al .",
    "2007 , fesquet et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the mto - france stations are located in a much more complex environment with elevated mountain ridges . in this region ,",
    "frequent channelled wind can persist for several days .",
    "the strongest and most frequent channeled valley wind is the mistral , which blows from the north / north - west in the rhne valley , separating the french alps ( highest elevation 4807 m ) to the east from the massif central ( highest elevation 1885 m ) to the west by a gap 200 km long and 60 km wide ( fig .",
    "[ fig : topo ] ) ( drobinski et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it occurs when a synoptic northerly flow impinges on the alpine range . as the flow experiences channeling",
    ", it is substantially accelerated and can extend offshore over horizontal ranges exceeding few hundreds of kilometers ( salameh et al .",
    "2007 , lebeaupin - brossier and drobinski 2009 ) .",
    "the mistral occurs all year long but exhibits a seasonal variability either in speed and direction , or in its spatial distribution ( mayencon 1982 , orieux and pouget 1984 , gunard et al .",
    "2005 , gunard et al .",
    "2006 ) . during summer",
    ", the mistral shares its occurrence with a northerly land breeze and southerly sea - breeze ( e.g. bastin and drobinski , 2005 , 2006 ; drobinski et al . , 2006 , 2007 ) , which can also be channelled in the nearby valleys ( bastin et al . , 2005 )",
    "or interact with the mistral ( bastin et al . , 2006 ) . in such region",
    ", accounting for such persistent wind systems for modeling the wind speed statistics is thus mandatory .",

    "as opposed to the regular shape of wind speed and the surrounding topography at sirta , the complexity of the distributions in the rhne valley might originate in the complexity of the surrounding topography . for a deeper insight of the differences between observed wind speed distributions and",
    "the commonly used weibull distribution , the distribution of the wind components are now investigated ( fig .",

    "[ fig : wind_pdf_components]a ) , the zonal and meridional wind components have the same symmetrical distributions with zero mean and equal width : the wind is isotropic .",
    "in addition , the distributions of wind components have larger tails than gaussian .",
    "( a)(b )    ( c)(d )    at lyon ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wind_pdf_components]b ) , at the entrance of the rhne valley , the pdf of the zonal wind component is still symmetrical with almost zero mean and has a gaussian shape .",
    "the pdf of the meridional wind component is fairly symmetrical for values below 5  m  s@xmath21 but is skewed for the strongest values .",
    "also the width of the meridional wind pdf is larger than that of the zonal wind . at montlimar and orange , none of the wind component pdfs look like gaussian distribution and the meridional wind pdf become significantly larger than the pdf of the zonal wind .",
    "this shows evidence of the channelled nature of the wind by the north - south oriented rhne valley ( salameh et al .",
    "2009 ) . for low winds ,",
    "the pdfs of the zonal and meridional components are more similar , evidencing a less efficient impact of the valley flanks to orientate the wind .",
    "the two wind components may however be correlated .",
    "the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : wind_pdf_components ] show the joint distribution of the two wind components at sirta observatory , lyon , montlimar and orange . at the sirta observatory",
    ", the rather flat terrain produces an isotropic wind statistics ( _ i.e. _ the wind blows in all directions ) with no correlation between the two components ( _ i.e. _ the joint distribution displays a circular shape ) .",
    "conversely , the joint distributions at lyon , montlimar and orange display strongly correlated wind components in specific directions .",
    "the main directions correspond to the north - south orientation of the rhne valley .",
    "to conclude on the observations , it appears that at sirta and lyon , while the weibull function fits better wind speed distributions , the wind components are less anisotropic .",
    "therefore , it seems that isotropy is crucial for the weibull description to be valid . in the following , despite the fact that none of the observed distributions is gaussian , we shall focus on anisotropic bivariate distribution to understand the effect of anisotropy on the resulting wind speed distribution .",
    "the very first approach to model anisotropy is to consider a bivariate distribution of gaussian wind components with means @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and variances @xmath24 and @xmath31 and finite cross - correlation @xmath3 . after a change of variable , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ,",
    "the resulting joint distribution is a bivariate elliptical distribution with variances @xmath34 and @xmath35 without correlation . in the case",
    "@xmath36 ( crutcher and baer 1962 ) , @xmath37 applying the usual transformation from cartesian to polar coordinates ( @xmath0,@xmath38 ) , and integrating over the angle @xmath38 , the joint pdf for @xmath0 and @xmath38 is ( chew and boyce 1962 ) : @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and where @xmath42 is the modified bessel function of the first kind and zero order . when the variance are equal @xmath43 , so @xmath44 and eq .  ( [ eq : wind_speed_pdf_anisotrop ] ) is the weibull distribution with parameter @xmath45 , which is the rayleigh distribution . when comparing the elliptical normal joint distribution with data , ( table  [ tab : comp_obs_pdf_vs_model_pdf ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : wind_pdf_modulus_3 ] ) , it is worse than a fit by the weibull distribution . despite the fact taking account of anisotropy of wind components modifies the tail of the distributions , the gaussian approximation is too crude to model wind speed components .",
    "however , using gaussian distributions is a powerful approach because analytic calculation can be performed .",
    "( a)(b )      as a second order approximation and for the sake of simplicity , we now consider the case of elliptic distributions with non zero mean @xmath29 and @xmath46 and equal variances @xmath47 .",
    "equal variances for the two wind components .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath48 with @xmath49 . the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wind_speed_pdf_mean_wind ] ) is called the rice distribution and @xmath50 is the @xmath51 order modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "the key assumption we do in the following is that , in the rhne valley area , there are two regimes : ( i ) random flow : the wind components have zero means and same variances , and the rayleigh distribution describes well the wind speed statistics ; ( ii ) channeled flow : the wind components have different means , and the rice distribution describes well the wind speed statistics . the resulting distribution is a sum of the distribution ( i ) and ( ii ) conditioned to the absence and presence of the channeled flow occurrence . in other words , in the long - term , the wind system is described as the superposition of different local dynamics at different intervals that has been coined by beck and cohen ( 2003 ) as superstatistics or statistics of statistics .",
    "this yields , for one wind component , for instance the zonal wind , @xmath52 ( similar expression would arise for the meridional component , @xmath53 ) : @xmath54 in the case of the two regimes scenario , @xmath55 is bimodal , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the dirac function and @xmath58 is here the weight corresponding to channeled flow events occurrence .",
    "the pdf of @xmath59 , is thus a combination of a rayleigh distribution ( corresponding to @xmath60 ) and a rice distribution .",
    "such a method has been used to include in wind statistics modeling the contribution of zero wind speed ( tackle and brown 1978 , tuller and brett 1983 ) . as a result",
    "we obtain the rayleigh - rice distribution : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the normalization factor .",
    "when comparing to data , the weighted rayleigh - rice function provides a much better fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wind_pdf_modulus_3 ] ) and estimates much better the wind power ( table  [ tab : comp_obs_pdf_vs_model_pdf ] ) than the weibull distribution .",
    "we indeed obtain less than @xmath63 relative error for all locations and even less than @xmath64 in montlimar .",
    "table  [ tab : comp_obs_pdf_vs_model_pdf ] shows that the weighted rayleigh - rice function gives by far the best estimate of the wind power at lyon , montlimar and orange .",
    "the values of @xmath58 correspond very accurately to the probability of occurrence of the dominating mistral situations ( orieux and pouget 1984 ) .",
    "thus , taking account of the existence of regimes in regions where mountain environments is a fruitful approach to quantify wind speed statistics and to estimate wind power potential .",
    "figure  [ fig : wind_pdf_components ] shows that at sirta , where the environment is much less complex than at the 3 other weather stations , the pdfs of the two wind components are not accurately predicted by a normal distribution and displays heavy tails .",
    "such heavy tails illustrate the departure of the wind component pdfs from the normal distribution model .",
    "we show here that super - statistics can help for the understanding the non - gaussian shape .",
    "since both wind components at the sirta station have very close statistical properties ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wind_pdf_components]a ) , for the sake of concision , we will focus on one component , @xmath52 , throughout this section .    the large tails of the wind component distributions at sirta ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wind_pdf_components]a ) originate in the transient nature of the wind .",
    "meteorological conditions indeed change on several time - scales ( day , anticyclones duration , season ) .",
    "for instance , the strongest wind being typically recorded in the winter , whereas in summer , long - lasting anticyclonic conditions give lower wind speeds .",
    "this induces a change of the statistical properties ( e.g. wind component variance ) on several entangled time scales . here",
    ", we model this by assuming gaussian shape of wind distribution , but with changing standard deviation , @xmath65 .",
    "the super - statistics of the wind components can be derived as follows ( rizzo and rapisarda 2004 ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the probability distribution of the fluctuating variable @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sirta_superstat]a shows the distributions of short samples of wind component speed @xmath52 measured at the sirta observatory , rescaled by their standard deviation , @xmath65 , computed over 4  hr time periods .",
    "( a)(b )    ( c)(d )    we see that the distributions of wind component velocity acquired during short time samples is well rescaled by its standard deviation",
    ". we can therefore assume the wind component distributions to be @xmath69 figure  [ fig : sirta_superstat]b shows the distribution of each sample standard deviation @xmath70 and its fit by a gamma distribution .",
    "we see that the distribution of @xmath71 is consistent with a gamma distribution , of parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath12 is the gamma function .",
    "hence , combining it to eq .",
    "( [ eq : superstatistics_2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the euler integral of the first kind .",
    "this distribution is called the generalized boltzmann factor .",
    "it has been obtained when attempting to generalize the entropy definition ( tsallis 1988 , beck and cohen 2003 ) . the distributions modeled with eq .",
    "( [ eq : superstatistics_4 ] ) display heavy power law tails reminiscent of rare events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sirta_superstat]c ) .",
    "unfortunately , our data has not enough statistics to observe such rare events and we can not compare the tails of the distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sirta_superstat]d ) . yet , note that the central part of the observed distributions matches very well the distributions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : superstatistics_4 ] ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sirta_superstat]d ) .",
    "we now turn to wind speed distribution , which is at stake for wind energy . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the components @xmath52 and @xmath53 are independent statistically . besides , we had previously observed that : ( i ) there is no correlation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wind_pdf_components]a - inset ) ; ( ii ) @xmath52 and @xmath53 have similar statistics , _",
    "i.e. _ both components are described by the same @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the wind speed distribution is obtained by computing the joint distribution in radial coordinates and integrated over the angle .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath77 where @xmath76 is the euler integral of the first kind and @xmath78 is the hypergeometric function . again , this yields a heavy tail distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sirta_superstat_module]a ) , but for the set of parameters that fits the data the most ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sirta_superstat_module]b ) , the wide tails occur for very low probability , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : superstat_5 ] ) fits very well the data .",
    "( a)(b )      for a more in - depth analysis of the physical processes , several studies model the wind speed or its components using stochastic differential equation ( sde ) ( e.g. nfaoui et al .",
    "2004 , bernardin et al .",
    "a first order sde for stochastic process @xmath52 can be written as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are arbitrary functions and @xmath82 is a random function of time , often referred to as a `` noise term '' . considering the time evolution of the probability density function , @xmath83 , associated to the stochastic variable , @xmath52 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdex ] ) can be converted into the fokker - planck equation , @xmath84 if @xmath81 is constant , the system is said to be subject to additive noise , otherwise it is said to be subject to multiplicative noise .",
    "the stochastic processes @xmath52 is usually a markov process , i.e. characterized as memoryless : the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it .",
    "a number of authors have modeled explicitly the temporal dependence of the wind speed through markov chain models ( youcef ettoumi et al .",
    "2003 , nfaoui et al .",
    "2004 , shamshad et al .",
    "2005 , fawcett and walshaw 2006a , fawcett and walshaw 2006b ) .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : superstatistics_4 ] ) is also the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fokker - langevin_x ] ) , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are constants governing the strength of the multiplicative ( first term ) and additive ( second term ) noise . the relations between @xmath87 , @xmath88 and the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : superstatistics_3 ] ) are : @xmath89 the multiplicative and additive noise terms can be physically interpreted as an interplay between turbulence , chaotic atmospheric variability and the mean wind ( bernardin et al . 2009 ) . in the case of non - multiplicative noise , @xmath90 ,",
    "the strength of the noise does not depend on the mean wind and the resulting stationary distribution is gaussian .",
    "conversely , the multiplicative stochastic process , used to model wind stress over the ocean by sura and gille ( 2003 ) , makes the link between the wind variability and its mean state and induces a stationary power - law distribution ( sakaguchi 2001 ) .",
    "yet , as the observed wind component distributions are narrower than power - laws , this multiplicative stochastic model is crude to describe them .",
    "finally , besides the rather accurate but empirical fit of the weibull distribution to measured wind speed distribution , is there thus a physical reason to model wind speed statistics with a weibull distribution ? in order to address this question ,",
    "a first step might be to consider a sde with @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( queirs 2008 ) .",
    "indeed , this yields the joint pdf for wind speed , @xmath0 and direction , @xmath38 , @xmath93 .",

    "despite the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq : superstatistics_pdf_polar ] ) can not be integrated with respect to @xmath38 between 0 and @xmath95 because of integration singularities , it shares common features with a weibull distribution , namely the power - law and stretched - exponential with exponent @xmath96 .",
    "future works will thus explore in more detail the potential of such sde to model wind speed statistics .",
    "the use of the weibull distribution for wind statistics modeling and wind energy evaluation is a convenient and powerful approach .",
    "is is however based on empirical more than physical justification and might display at times strong limitations for its application . in this article , we model the wind components instead of the wind speed itself , and thereby provide more physical insights on the validity domain of the weibull distribution as a possible relevant model for wind statistics .",
    "based on wind measurements collected nearby paris in a rather flat environment and in southern france in the rhne valley in a ridge and mountains environment , this article proposes different probability density functions of the wind components .",
    "this opens the path to the analysis of the applicability of the weibull distribution as a suited model for wind statistics and the quantification of the errors on the mean wind speed and wind power arising from the use of the weibull distribution .",
    "this study first shows that in complex terrain , the existence of terrain induced wind system affects the surface wind distribution which does not display a weibull shape . modeling the wind statistics with a weibull distribution produces errors exceeding @xmath97 on the wind power estimate .",
    "the combination of a rayleigh distribution to model the `` isotropic '' wind and a rice distribution to model persistent wind regimes gives excellent results for the three surface weather stations located in the rhne valley .",
    "combining rayleigh and rice distributions is equivalent to applying the recently developed super - statistics theory , which models the wind system as the superposition of different local dynamics at different intervals with different mean wind speeds .",
    "however , rayleigh and rice distributions assume normal distributions for the two wind components .",
    "the distributions of the wind components , even over flat terrain , however exhibit non gaussian distribution .",
    "this can also be modeled using super - statistics theory , which assumes fluctuating variances of the two wind components , that are eventually modeled by a gaussian distribution over a short time interval",
    ". however , this produces power - law distribution for large wind speed value which contradict observed distributions and weibull model .",
    "this can be partly overcome by assuming the wind components to verify stochastic differential equation with multiplicative noise with power coefficient .",

    "<S> wind speed statistics is generally modeled using the weibull distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is convenient since it fully characterizes analytically with only two parameters ( the shape and scale parameters ) the shape of distribution and the different moments of the wind speed ( mean , standard deviation , skewness and kurtosis ) . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is broadly used in the wind energy sector to produce maps of wind energy potential . however , the weibull distribution is based on empirical rather than physical justification and might display strong limitations for its applications . </S>",
    "<S> the philosophy of this article is based on the modeling of the wind components instead of the wind speed itself . </S>",
    "<S> this provides more physical insights on the validity domain of the weibull distribution as a possible relevant model for wind statistics and the quantification of the error made by using such a distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we thereby propose alternative expressions of more suited wind speed distribution . </S>",
