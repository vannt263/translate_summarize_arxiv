    "<S> the recent measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath0 shows a @xmath1 deviation from the standard model value . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it puts strong constraints on the parameter space of the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) ii . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contribution of the higgs bosons comes at the two - loop level , and in order to explain the data it favors a pseudoscalar @xmath2 with a light mass range and a large @xmath3 . at 95% c.l . , </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit for @xmath4 is @xmath5 gev for @xmath6 , and @xmath3 is bounded below at 17 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in sharp contrast to the conclusion one draws from considering one - loop higgs contributions alone . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also discuss the role of the higgs contributions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent result on the measurement of muon anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath0 ) by the experiment e821@xcite at brookhaven national laboratory has reduced the error to a very small level . comparing the data with the prediction from the standard model ( sm)@xcite , one gets the deviation @xmath7 which may suggest the presence of contributions from physics beyond the sm . taking the above numbers at face value , the range of @xmath8 at 95% c.l . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath9 ) is given by @xmath10    most of the extensions of the sm start with an extended higgs sector , the simplest of which is the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the more interesting model ii@xcite shares the same higgs structure as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , going beyond the sm to look for extra contributions to @xmath0 , the 2hdm should be among the first to be examined seriously .    in this rapid communication </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the contributions from the 2hdm ii . </S>",
    "<S> stringent constraints are thus obtained on the parameter space of the model . </S>",
    "<S> the results are summarized as follows . in the 2hdm ii , </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contribution actually comes at the two - loop level , and in order to explain the data @xmath11 is preferred to come from the higgs pseudoscalar @xmath2 , the mass of which is required to be less than 29 ( 55 ) ( 85 ) gev for @xmath12 by the 95% c.l . </S>",
    "<S> range of eq.([95 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath3 has to be larger than 17 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been some work on the same subject @xcite ; however , the paper only considered the one - loop contributions from the higgs bosons , which become smaller than their corresponding two - loop contributions when the higgs bosons are heavier than a few gev and substantially smaller for heavier higgs bosons . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the two - loop contributions considered here dramatically change the story of the higgs sector contributions to @xmath0 and invalidate most of the results of the one - loop studies . </S>",
    "<S> although we focus on the 2hdm ii here , a similar conclusion holds for most models with possible large contributions from the higgs sector . in models with flavor - changing higgs couplings , in particular , </S>",
    "<S> there are potentially 1-loop contributions substantially larger than the flavor - conserving ones@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the barr - zee type 2-loop contributions would still have an important role to play and should be taken into consideration . </S>",
    "<S> this fact has often been overlooked in the literature .    in the mssm , </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contribution comes from the chargino - sneutrino - loop diagrams and it has been shown @xcite that to satisfy @xmath8 requires the gaugino mass and the smuon mass below about @xmath13 . because of additional mass constraints on the scalars in mssm , the total contribution from the higgs bosons is not at a significant level and thus will not affect the conclusion of ref.@xcite . while the typical failure of the mssm studies to address this kind of 2-loop contribution is a potential problem , our results here get rid of the worry , at least for the case of a more generic scalar mass spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> many other extensions of the sm have extra contributions to the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> some examples are additional gauge bosons@xcite , leptoquarks@xcite , and muon substructure@xcite . however , not all of them can contribute in the right direction as indicated by the data . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath14 measurement can differentiate among various models , and perhaps with other existing data can put very strong constraints on the model under consideration .    </S>",
    "<S> given the mass bound on sm higgs boson @xcite , the higgs contribution to @xmath8 at one - loop level is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been emphasized , in ref.@xcite for example , that for higgs boson mass larger than about @xmath15 , the dominant higgs contribution to @xmath0 actually comes from the two - loop barr - zee diagram ( first discussed by bjorken and weinberg ) @xcite with a heavy fermion ( @xmath16 ) running in the loop . a @xmath17 factor could easily overcome the @xmath18 loop factor . the two - loop scalar contribution with a heavy fermion @xmath16 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , is given by @xmath19 where f(z)=12 z ^1_0 dx , @xmath20 represents the number of color degrees of freedom in @xmath16 , and @xmath21 its electric charge . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath22 denotes a generic lepton , @xmath23 is the ( scalar ) higgs boson mass , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent plausible modifications to the higgs couplings of the fermions ( @xmath26 in the sm ) .    </S>",
    "<S> ref.@xcite quoted an electroweak contribution , calculated up to two - loop level , of @xmath27 included in this number is a barr - zee diagram contribution with a @xmath28 loop . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value of this result barely exceeds the order of @xmath29 ( see also ref.@xcite ) and is negative for any reasonable value of @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , there are other purely bosonic two - loop contributions @xcite , in which the sm higgs boson also plays a role </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , all the contributions involving the sm higgs boson are quite small@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when considering a model with an extended higgs sector , a complete analysis would first require one to subtract the sm higgs contribution and recalculate all the higgs contributions . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the number of higgs bosons , their effective couplings , and mass constraints would be different from the sm scenario . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in our study here , we only calculate the higgs barr - zee diagram contributions and assume that this does give a very good approximation of @xmath0 from the diagrams involving higgs bosons ( @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our rationale is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the region of parameter space where the higgs contributions could explain the discrepancy of eq.([exp ] ) , or at least , in the case of models that have other important contributions , do play a substantial role in @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we focus on the region where @xmath31 is at or close to the order of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see below , the possibility of having such largely enhanced higgs contributions comes from the combined effect of coupling enhancements and weakened higgs mass constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling enhancement is only to be found among the yukawa couplings , thus illustrating the special importance of the barr - zee diagram considered .    in a model with an extended higgs sector </S>",
    "<S> , we can write the fermion couplings of a neutral higgs mass eigenstate @xmath33 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the effective scalar and pseudoscalar couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of two - loop diagram ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) to @xmath0 is then given by the sum of eq.([s ] ) ( with @xmath37 ) and the pseudoscalar expression @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ) , where g(z)=12 z ^1_0 dx . without cp violation in the higgs sector , eqs.([s ] ) or ( [ ps ] ) gives directly the contribution from a scalar or a pseudoscalar , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding contributions with the @xmath40 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] replaced by the @xmath41 are suppressed by about two orders of magnitude@xcite , hence neglected here . </S>",
    "<S> we also skip the details about the similar contribution from a charged higgs boson , which involves a @xmath42 boson and is thus suppressed also . </S>",
    "<S> note that a light charged higgs boson less than @xmath43 is ruled out by the cern @xmath44 collider ( lep ) experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , analysis of its contribution to @xmath45 leads to a much stronger lower bound  @xmath46 , as claimed in ref.@xcite , for instance .    </S>",
    "<S> the 2hdm has three physical neutral higgs bosons : two scalars @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and the pseudoscalar @xmath2 . for model ii under consideration , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding nonzero @xmath49 or @xmath50 for @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are given by & & h ( _ f ) : - - + & & h ( _ f ) : + & & a ( a_f ) : respectively , in the standard notation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what is particularly interesting phenomenologically is the enhancement of the couplings of @xmath53 at large @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the dominant contributions then come from the diagrams with a @xmath55 or @xmath56 loop .    </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out in ref.@xcite that the two - loop pseudoscalar contribution to @xmath0 is positive while the two - loop scalar contribution is negative in the large @xmath3 region . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is always true for the dominating contributions with a @xmath55 or @xmath56 loop , independent of the scalar mixing angle @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the reverse happens in the corresponding one - loop contributions , but these one - loop contributions are suppressed relative to the two - loop contributions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , using the one - loop @xmath0 result in constraining the 2hdm ii has been studied extensively@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using the two - loop result , however , changes the story dramatically and invalidates most of the conclusions from the one - loop studies .    applying the @xmath8 constraint to the 2hdm ii </S>",
    "<S> , we need to suppress the scalar - higgs ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) contributions , as it comes in the opposite direction as indicated by the data , relative to the pseudoscalar contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this is in direct contradiction to what is suggested in the one - loop studies . at large @xmath3 both the dominating contributions from the scalars and the pseudoscalar scale roughly as @xmath3 . for the scalar part </S>",
    "<S> , we can adjust the mixing angle @xmath57 to zero such that the contribution from the light higgs boson @xmath47 is negligible , and impose a large mass hierarchy between the scalar higgs @xmath48 and the pseudoscalar @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> then a relatively light mass for the pseudoscalar @xmath2 will give a sufficiently large positive contribution to @xmath8 , or the required @xmath8 value could be used to obtain the admissible range for @xmath4 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we show the contribution of @xmath58 from the pseudoscalar @xmath2 versus @xmath4 for various values of @xmath3 . we included the one - loop and two - loop pseudoscalar contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded region is the 95% c.l . </S>",
    "<S> range of eq.([95 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the required range of @xmath4 is then given by about 4  29 ( 15  85 ) gev for @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a @xmath60 is always required .    </S>",
    "<S> what happens when other mixing angles @xmath57 are chosen ? </S>",
    "<S> the light higgs boson @xmath47 will give a negative contribution to @xmath0 and thus offsets the pseudoscalar contribution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the required range of @xmath4 shifts to a lower value in order to accommodate the data . </S>",
    "<S> we show the contour plots of @xmath8 in the plane of @xmath61 for a small and a large @xmath57 at @xmath62 and @xmath63 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath64 limit , which corresponds to switching off the contribution from the scalar @xmath47 , can be easily read off from the vertical asymptotes . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath65 corresponds to the maximal contribution from @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the contour plots show how the contribution from the scalar @xmath47 affects the solution to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at @xmath66 for @xmath67 , the 95% c.l . required range of @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> lowers to 1347 gev for @xmath68 .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> , it is interesting to take into consideration other experimental constraints on higgs masses . </S>",
    "<S> a collider search for the neutral higgs bosons in the context of the 2hdm typically rules out a region of small @xmath23 and @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an opal analysis@xcite using the lep ii data up to @xmath70 excludes the regions @xmath71 _ and _ @xmath72 at 95% c.l . , independent of @xmath57 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a conservative limit . </S>",
    "<S> details of the exclusion region vary with @xmath57 and @xmath3 , and go substantially beyond the rectangular box@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , the search for @xmath2 relies on the process @xmath73 , therefore , if @xmath23 is so large that this process becomes negligible for @xmath2 production , there would be no limit on @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , below @xmath74 gev , the direct search in @xmath75 was not included because the detection efficiency vanishes and the total @xmath41 width only provides very limited exclusion . </S>",
    "<S> the opal exclusion region is roughly sitting at the center on the @xmath4 axis going up to about @xmath76 in the plots of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , and cuts out part of the admissible region of the @xmath77 solution . for @xmath23 larger than the opal limit the admissible @xmath4 range </S>",
    "<S> is roughly from 3 to 50 gev for @xmath78 . at larger @xmath3 ( 60 as the illustrated example ) , the range widens , especially at the upper end ; but a middle range ( about 4 to 15 here ) is lost as @xmath77 gets too large . </S>",
    "<S> there is another admissible small window at very small @xmath23 ( a few gev ) with large @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this region is indeed dominated by the one - loop contribution from @xmath47 , but even here , the two - loop contribution ( from @xmath47 ) has an important role to play . </S>",
    "<S> this tiny @xmath23 window and the similar solution with this kind of small @xmath69 are in fact excluded by upsilon decay@xcite and some other processes@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the constraint from direct search , there are also other constraints on the masses of the higgs bosons coming from the electroweak precision data . </S>",
    "<S> while a comprehensive treatment of the topic is really beyond the scope of the present study , we discuss below the basic features , using results from a recent paper@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scope of the latter study is limited to the large @xmath79 region and @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> there , the ratio @xmath81 is constrained at 95% c.l . </S>",
    "<S> ( based on the bayesian approach ) via the function @xmath82 where @xmath83 solving for @xmath81 at @xmath84 , we obtain , respectively , @xmath85 we can see that the precision electroweak data prefers a region close to the diagonal of the @xmath23 verses @xmath86 plot . if one naively imposes the result of @xmath87 at @xmath88 onto fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) , which is at a different @xmath57 but with which a similar result is expected to be valid , together with the direct search limit @xmath89 gev and the @xmath0 requirement , only a small  triangle \" is left . </S>",
    "<S> this triangle is bounded by @xmath90 gev , @xmath91 and the contour of @xmath92 [ labeled by  10 \" in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the surviving parameter space region , however , is in the more favorable  larger \" mass area . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it re - enforces our previous comment at the end of the last paragraph that the one - loop dominating tiny @xmath23 window of solution to @xmath0 is ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> the situation for the other @xmath57 values is expected to be similar . </S>",
    "<S> it will be very interesting to have the complete phenomenological analysis combining all the constraints on the 2hdm .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the role of the higgs sector contributions to @xmath0 in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> the lep bound on the higgs boson masses is in the range 85  95 gev@xcite . from the above result , one may naively conclude that if a higgs particle is just around the corner , it could have an important role to play in @xmath0 . however , there are some strong theoretical constraints on the relation of the higgs boson masses in the mssm . at the large @xmath3 value required , </S>",
    "<S> one has @xmath93 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of the higgs contributions to @xmath0 cancel among themselves . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a small higgs boson mass may require a @xmath94 parameter so small that the chargino / neutralino contributions to @xmath0 get far too large . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we have checked and found no interesting solution within mssm in which the higgs contributions play a substantial role . in the admissible range of chargino / smuon masses found in ref.@xcite , the total higgs contribution is only about 1% of the susy contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of this null result should not be underestimated .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the new measurement on the muon anomalous magnetic moment constrains severely on the parameter space of the 2hdm ii , and our results , including one - loop and two - loop contributions , change dramatically from the conclusion that one draws by using only one - loop results . </S>"
