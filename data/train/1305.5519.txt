    "clusters of galaxies play a critical role in understanding the formation and evolution of large - scale structure , and determining cosmological parameters .",
    "their mass is one of the most crucial quantities to be evaluated .",
    "strong @xcite and weak ( @xcite , @xcite ) lensing measurements , and sunyaev & zeldovich ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sz ) effect observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) have become reliable mass estimators .",
    "still , x - ray observations provide one of the fundamental methods to recover the galaxy cluster mass .",
    "most of these studies include the assumption of the hydrostatic equilibrium for the intracluster medium ( icm ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this hypothesis implies that only the thermal pressure of the hot icm is taken into account .",
    "it has been claimed that non - thermal motions , such as turbulence and rotation , could play a significant role in supporting the icm , in particular in the innermost region , and so biasing the mass measurements based on the hydrostatic equilibrium ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite evaluated that x - ray measurements of relaxed clusters assuming hydrostatic equilibrium can lead to underestimate the virial mass by up to @xmath2 ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to the recent improvements in hydrodynamical simulations , the expected pressure support from random turbulent gas motion can be estimated ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite noticed that , in simulated clusters , the velocity dispersion tensor @xmath3 of the icm is approximately isotropic in the outskirts of clusters and it becomes increasingly tangential at smaller radii , especially for the most relaxed systems .",
    "@xcite showed that the support of the icm from rotational and streaming motions is comparable to the support from the random turbulent pressure out to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the radius enclosing a mean overdensity of 500 in units of the universe critical density .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by @xcite , who considered non radiative simulations of cluster formation .    the direct observation of the velocity structure of",
    "the icm would help in understanding the robustness of the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis and in revealing the mechanisms altering this equilibrium .",
    "in particular , icm rotation and turbulence can be induced from mergers and accretion of external matter , and can trace the cooling gas in the inner regions @xcite . the most direct way to measure gas motions in galaxy clusters",
    "would be via the broadening of the line profile of heavy ions and the shift of their centroids .",
    "this method has been discussed in detail in @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the imprint of icm motions on the iron line profile requires high - resolution spectroscopy , which will become possible in the near future with the next - generation x - ray instruments , such as astro - h @xcite",
    ". only few observational constraints on icm internal motions have been obtained with the currently available instruments .",
    "@xcite , using xmm - newton reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) spectra of about 60 among x - ray bright galaxy clusters , groups and elliptical galaxies , find an upper limit on the velocity broadening of @xmath6 in about a third of the sample , with 5 targets with limits of @xmath7 or lower .",
    "another indirect signature of large - scale rotation in galaxy clusters is the ellipticity of the x - ray isophotes due to flattening of the underlying gas density distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "clearly , if the halo deviates significantly from spherical symmetry , flattening of the x - ray isophotes is expected even in absence of rotation . in this context , the triaxiality of the galaxy clusters is a standard scenario confirmed both by the observations ( @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite ) and by @xmath8-body numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "however , it is not excluded that a substantial part of the observed x - ray ellipticity is due to rotational flattening @xcite . @xcite",
    "have evaluated the isophote shapes of clusters observed with chandra and rosat , with a mean value of @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite , using the chandra and rosat / pspc nearby cluster sample by @xcite , observed a mean ellipticity of @xmath10 in the radial range @xmath11 .",
    "the rotation of the icm is potentially relevant also to studies of the thermal stability of the icm itself . an important question to understand",
    "the evolution of galaxy clusters is whether the icm is subject to thermal instability , so that cold clouds of gas can condense spontaneously far from the cluster centre ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this problem has been investigated in detail under the assumption that the icm does not rotate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent work on the thermal stability of rotating plasmas @xcite has shown that the onset of thermal instability can be significantly influenced by rotation .",
    "it follows that , not only x - ray based mass estimates , but also the question of the thermal stability of the icm should be reconsidered if significant rotation is detected in the hot gas of galaxy clusters .    in this work ,",
    "we study the signatures of the presence of rotation of the icm in observable properties of models representative of massive x - ray luminous galaxy clusters .",
    "we present simple rotation velocity laws consistent with the observed ellipticity profiles .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate the capability of the the next generation x - ray instruments , such as the x - ray calorimeter spectrometer on board the astro - h satellite , in detecting and discriminating between different type of motions in the icm distribution .",
    "this calorimeter , thanks to its excellent energy resolution ( with a requirement of @xmath12 and a goal of @xmath13 ) , will allow us to directly detect non - thermal contributions to the cluster pressure support , such as measuring the line centroid doppler shift due to the rotational velocity in the icm and the emission line broadening due to turbulent motions .",
    "here we present the fluid equations governing our models of rotating icm .",
    "we consider the equations describing an axisymmetric gaseous system in permanent rotation in equilibrium in an axisymmetric gravitational potential @xmath14 .",
    "the imposed symmetry implies that the physical variables depend only on the cylindrical coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the stationary hydrodynamic equations governing the gas distribution are then @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the gas density , pressure , and angular velocity , respectively .",
    "the gas rotational velocity is given by @xmath21 , whilst we assume @xmath22 ; @xmath14 represents the total gravitational potential , including the stars , gas and dark matter contribution .    in general @xmath23 , but for simplicity we consider here the case of cylindrical rotation @xmath24 .",
    "the _ poincar - wavre _ theorem ( @xcite ) states that cylindrical rotation ( i.e. @xmath20 depends only on @xmath15 ) is a necessary and sufficient condition to have a barotropic stratification , in which the isobaric and isodensity surfaces coincide , so @xmath25 . when @xmath24 , introducing the effective potential @xmath26 the system of equations  ( [ sys ] ) can be written as @xmath27 which shows that a barotropic fluid can be seen as in hydrostatic equilibrium in the effective potential . assuming that the distribution is polytropic , so @xmath28 , in which @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a reference point , and @xmath32 is the polytropic index , equation  ( [ eqpoi ] ) becomes @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "as @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 , leading to @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "we do not attempt to model a particular cluster , but we present an idealised case study representative of massive clusters . for our case study , we consider a model cluster with a total mass fixed to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mass measured at the radius @xmath48 , within which the mean cluster density is 200 times the cosmic critical density at the cluster redshift .",
    "the @xmath8-body simulations of the structure formation in cold dark matter models show that the density distribution of the dark matter haloes can be well characterized , for given @xmath47 , with only two parameters , the scale radius @xmath49 and the concentration parameter @xmath50 ( @xcite ; hereafter nfw ) , which are related to @xmath48 by @xmath51 . in order to fix @xmath50",

    "this relation points out the tendency of more massive cluster haloes to be less concentrated than the smaller haloes . for @xmath56 , we get @xmath57 , which we assume for our models",
    ". we can now evaluate @xmath48 ( and then @xmath49 ) of the cluster model from the equation @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the critical density at the cluster redshift @xmath16 and @xmath60^{1/2}$ ] is the hubble parameter .",
    "we consider @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which we adopt in our model cluster .",
    "we assume also that the mass distribution of the cluster is spherical with nfw density profile .",
    "the total gravitational potential is @xmath66 where @xmath67 therefore , we do not include explicitly the self gravity of the icm ( which is not spherically symmetric because of rotation ) : this is justified to first order because dark matter is known to be dominant .",
    "the assumption of a spherical dark matter halo deserves some discussion . of course",
    ", it would be possible to build analogous models with ellipsoidal dark matter halos ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , which are expected to be more realistic .",
    "the deviation from spherical symmetry of the dark matter halo is especially relevant in the present context because it can contribute to the flattening of the icm .",
    "however , for this very reason , we assume here spherically symmetric dark matter halo to disentangle the effect of rotation from the effect of a flattened gravitational potential .",
    "of course , with this choice we maximize the role of rotational flattening , so the velocity profiles here obtained must be considered upper limits to the line - of - sight rotational velocity , consistent with the observed isophote flattening .      in our models",
    "we assume that the icm rotates differentially with rotation speed constant on cylinders , so @xmath68 .",
    "the icm velocity pattern is currently almost unconstrained , both observationally and theoretically .",
    "this allows us to choose the velocity profile without particular restraint .",
    "here we consider the following rotation velocity laws : @xmath69 , \\label{eq : rot1}\\ ] ] @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the characteristic radius of the velocity law .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rot1 ] ) mimics the circular velocity profile of the nfw model , with a null value in the centre , followed by a steep rise at intermediate radii and a shallow decrease in the outer regions .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rot2 ] ) presents a steeper increase at small radii followed by a stronger decrease in the outer region .",
    "based on the above rotation laws , we choose three specific velocity profiles :    * equation ( [ eq : rot1 ] ) with @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; * equation ( [ eq : rot2 ] ) with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ; * equation ( [ eq : rot2 ] ) with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "the global properties of these models are the same as for models i and ni ( see table  [ common ] ) . in terms of the gas number density @xmath259 and temperature @xmath260 at the boundary ( related to pressure and density by @xmath261 and @xmath262 , where @xmath263 and @xmath264 is the proton mass ) , we assume @xmath265 , @xmath266 for model cc1 , @xmath267 , @xmath268 for model cc2 , and @xmath269 , @xmath270 for model cc3 . in fig .",
    "[ tempcc ] we plot the temperature profiles in the @xmath61 plane , for the rotating cc models .",
    "we obtain the surface brightness profiles along the @xmath61 and @xmath122 axes , shown in fig .",
    "[ britcc ] , where we included the composite non - rotating model , having the same gas fraction as the corresponding rotating models .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of the rotating models along @xmath122 and @xmath61 present a depletion of the inner regions comparable to the i and ni models .",
    "as expected , the cc models have higher central surface brightness compared to the ni models and steeper inner surface brightness profiles",
    ". the ellipticity profiles of the cc models are shown in fig  [ ccmod ] : the profiles are similar to those of the i and ni models , and therefore consistent with the observations by @xcite .     for the cc models cc1 ( dotted green line ) , cc2 ( dashed blu line ) and cc3 ( dot - dashed purple line ) . ]        .",
    "the symbols with error bars are the same as in fig .",
    "[ lau12 ] . ]    following the procedure in section  [ sec : spec ] , we build the simulated spectra of the cc models .",
    "the resulting spectra from region a2 present a shift ranging from @xmath271 for the vp1 model to @xmath138 for the vp2 and @xmath139 vp3 models , similar to the values obtained for the non - cool core models ( see section  [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "we show the results of the redshift fitting in table  [ zfit ] and in fig .",
    "[ ccpeso ] , plotted with the corresponding theoretical emission - weighted shift .",
    "we note again a slight asymmetry ( within the uncertainties ) due to the different response of the instrument at different energies .",
    "globally , the cc models maintain the same properties as the i and ni models .    , but for the cool core models cc1 ( triangles ) , cc2 ( squares ) and cc3 ( circles ) . ]",
    "the study of the dynamics of the intracluster medium is fundamental to depict the physical processes involved in the cluster evolution . in this work",
    ", we demonstrate the capability of the x - ray observations to characterise the features induced from a rotating icm on the shape of the surface brightness isophotes and on the spectral emission lines .",
    "this can be extended to test the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis on which the majority of the current x - ray mass estimate and calibrations of the scaling laws relies .",
    "we consider , as case study , representative models of massive galaxy clusters with a spherical dark matter halo .",
    "a simple modelling of the gas , obtained through the assumption of a polytropic distribution @xmath272 , allow us to span the whole range of the observed ellipticity profiles and to reproduce the observed values of @xcite .",
    "for instance , we find good agreement with the observed ellipticities for the rotation profile vp2 , with a peak velocity of @xmath273 at @xmath274 decreasing to @xmath275 at @xmath276 .",
    "we demonstrate also the capability of the future generation of the x - ray calorimeter expected to fly onboard the next generation of x - ray satellites , like the x - ray calorimeter spectrometer onboard the astro - h , to investigate some of the features induced by rotating icm .",
    "thanks to its excellent energy resolution ( with a goal of @xmath277 ) , such a calorimeter is suitable for detecting the doppler shift ( @xmath278 , @xmath279 and @xmath280 for our vp1 , vp2 and vp3 models , respectively ) and the emission line broadening ( of the order of @xmath281 ) on the icm emission lines with a good significance . together with a resolved imaging of the icm isophotes and the determination of their ellipticity , a calorimeter - like detector will permit to discriminate among the different velocity profiles here considered . we have extended this procedure to cool - core clusters , by using composite polytropic profiles .",
    "overall , the cool - core models are similar , in terms of ellipticity profile and spectral line shift , to the corresponding non cool - core models . a natural extension of our work would be the introduction of less crude rotation velocity patterns , for instance considering baroclinic distributions , in which the azimuthal velocity is not stratified on cylinders .",
    "this would help in obtaining a more regular gas morphology .",
    "also the question of the thermal stability of these rotating models has to be addressed in detail .",
    "finally , it would be useful to compare the icm shape obtained with high - resolution sz imaging .",
    "this is a potentially powerful means of extending this analysis to higher redshifts , because of the redshift independence of the sz effect .",
