    "at a redshift of 0.042 , mrk 231 is one of the nearest radio - quiet quasars to earth .",
    "mrk 231 is a well studied object because it is one of the brightest agn in the infrared sky .",
    "it is a quasar that is partially obscured by dusty gas as evidenced by its red optical / uv spectrum @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy has a strong starburst contribution , but the obscured agn bolometric luminosity , @xmath5 , can be inferred from a pronounced 10 @xmath6 peak in the ir spectrum @xcite . using the extracted ir agn luminosity , we estimate from qso composite spectra ( see @xcite ) that the total thermal luminosity created by the central engine is @xmath7 and mrk 231 would appear as a quasar with @xmath8 if not for the semi - transparent dusty shroud ( in agreement with the estimate in @xcite)=71 km / s / mpc , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in all our calculations . at z = 0.042 , 1 mas",
    "angular separation equates to 0.818 pc displacement in the sky plane in the adopted cosmology . ] .",
    "this equates to about 2.7 magnitudes of visual extinction created by the dusty enveloping gas . comparing the composite spectrum to the optical / uv spectrum in @xcite indicates even more severe reddening in the blue band , 3.1 magnitudes at @xmath11 .",
    "it is the closest radio quiet quasar in which there is sufficient radio flux to permit high signal to noise imaging with high frequency vlbi ( very long baseline interferometry ) observations . as a result of the ability to utilize the high resolution of vlbi ,",
    "this nucleus can be resolved with higher precision than any other radio quiet quasar nucleus .",
    ", is usually defined as a 5 ghz flux density 10 times larger than the @xmath11 flux density , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this definition is not appropriate , if there is intrinsic extinction as in balqsos .",
    "one must correct for the intrinsic blue band extinction and recompute the @xmath13 with dereddened blue fluxes , @xcite . noting the blue band extinction in the text and using the historic 5 ghz flux densities from ned yields a dereddened radio loudness , @xmath14 .",
    "this is close to the radio intermediate quasar category , @xmath15 , which are often just doppler boosted radio quiet quasars @xcite .",
    "we show that doppler boosting greatly enhances @xmath13 in mrk 231 as well .",
    "the intrinsic radio quiet nature of the agn in mrk 231 is not directly apparent because of optical reddening and doppler boosting . ]",
    "our 43 ghz observations can resolve the nucleus to within @xmath16 ( @xmath17 0.16 pc ) .",
    "it is a fortuitous circumstance that this object is a broad absorption line quasar ( balqso ) as well .",
    "about 10% - 15% of quasars show broad absorption line ( loosely defined as absorbing gas that is blue shifted at least 5,000 km / s relative to the qso rest frame and displaying a spread in velocity of at least 2,000 km / s ) outflows @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that most or all radio quiet quasars have bal outflows , but the designation of a quasar as a balqso depends on whether the line of sight intersects the solid angle subtended by the bal outflow .",
    "mrk 231 is a lobalqso ( a balqsos that exhibits low ionization resonant absorption troughs ) .",
    "mrk 231 has broad absorption in a variety of low ionization species , mg ii @xmath18 2798 , the well known na i d doublet , he i @xmath183889 i , ca ii k @xmath183934 and ca ii h @xmath183968 @xcite .",
    "thus , mrk 231 displays the full panoply of quasar related phenomena , broad emission lines , powerful thermal luminosity , uv broad absorption lines and a radio jet . therefore , as a consequence of its proximity to earth",
    ", mrk 231 can provide an optimal opportunity to study the interaction of these physical elements by means of high resolution vlbi observations on sub - parsec scales .",
    "earlier 15 ghz self - calibrated vlba ( very long baseline array ) observations reported in @xcite with sub mas resolution revealed a double radio source separated by approximately 1 pc .",
    "we initiated a program to look for more sub - structure and component motion at higher resolution by means of phase - referenced observations at 22 ghz and 43 ghz vlba as discussed in section 2 .",
    "no further resolution into sub - components was achieved even at 43 ghz .",
    "the two archival epochs showed that the nucleus was very dynamic and set a lower bound on the time variability brightness temperature of @xmath19 , below the inverse compton limit , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "thusly motivated , our program of observations attempted short time interval sampling ( 3 months between the epoch 2006.07 and 2006.32 ) in order to elucidate this highly dynamic behavior .",
    "mrk 231 did not disappoint , there was an enormous flare between these two epochs .",
    "section 5 is dedicated to analyzing the rapidly changing core .",
    "we use our data and the adopted cosmological model to show that the strong flare will violate the constraints associated with the brightness temperature limit unless relativistic doppler beaming is invoked .",
    "we also explore the steep spectrum secondary component of the nucleus of mrk 231 in section 6 .",
    "it is mildly variable and it is just less than a parsec from the core . based on the nature of the relativistic core , it is natural to wonder if there is any relativistic motion of the secondary . in section 3 ,",
    "we determine that the secondary is either not moving at all or is moving at velocities far below relativistic values .",
    "thus , the more relevant question becomes what is constraining the secondary from having such motion .",
    "section 6 uses our vlba observations and archival low frequency observations to model the apparent free - free absorption of the secondary emission .",
    "we argue that this same gas is confining the secondary by ram pressure and that this gas is likely one and the same as the bal wind .",
    "high frequency ( 15 , 22 and 43  ghz ) observations were conducted at epochs 2006.07 ( project i d bp124a ) and 2006.32 ( project i d bp124b ) with all ten antennas of the vlba .",
    "in addition , data from 2000.02 ( project i d bu013e ) at frequencies of 8.4 , 15 and 22  ghz and 8.3 ghz data from 2006.67 ( project i d ba080b ) were retrieved from the vlba public archive .",
    "the data were correlated on the vlba correlator in socorro , nm and calibrated with nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package .",
    "in addition to the standard calibration procedure for vlbi polarization observations @xcite , an attempt was made to correct for amplitude losses due to opacity using the aips task apcal @xcite .    at all epochs and frequencies , except 2006.67 , the data were initially phase - referenced @xcite to j1302 + 5748 . at frequencies below 43",
    "ghz the data were then phase self - calibrated , but at 43  ghz there was insufficient signal - to - noise to allow this .",
    "the phase reference source was imaged to provide the best possible model for the phase referencing procedure , but proved in any case to be a very close approximation to a point source .",
    "figure [ 8ghzmaps ] captures the images of the 8.4  ghz observations from 2000.02 and 2006.67 .",
    "figures  [ 15ghzmaps ] and [ 22ghzmaps ] are the images at 15 and 22  ghz , respectively , for all three epochs and figure  [ 43ghzmaps ] is the 43  ghz images from 2006.07 and 2006.32 .",
    "all images of mrk231 presented in this paper are made with briggs robust weighting scheme @xcite , with the robustness parameter set to zero , with the exception of the 43  ghz image at epoch 2006.32 where natural weighting is used .",
    "all images are centered on the position of the southwestern , secondary , component at rectangular coordinate ( 0  mas , 0  mas ) .",
    "each of the images shows a pair of unresolved components separated by about 1  mas that vary in brightness , but do not vary significantly in separation .",
    "the ne component is the most variable and has the flattest spectrum and it is assumed to be associated with the agn nucleus .",
    "gaussians were fitted to the positions of the two components using the difmap software package @xcite and the resultant parameters are presented in tables  [ table : fluxes ] and [ table : sep ] .",
    "errors in the flux density in table 1 arise from two sources : the absolute flux scale error , and an error due to uncertainties in the model fit .",
    "the method used to determine the model fit part of the error is from @xcite .",
    "the absolute flux scale errors for the vlba are estimated to be @xmath21 at 8  ghz @xcite and 15  ghz @xcite , and @xmath22 at 22  ghz @xcite . at 43  ghz",
    "we estimate the error on the absolute flux density scale to @xmath23  the non - symmetric error arising from the fact that some flux density is likely lost due to the inability to phase self - calibrate this source at that frequency .",
    "an analysis of the amplitude corrections derived from self - calibration of various calibrator sources indicates that these observations were not affected by any unusual amplitude errors that would lead to larger errors than the values quoted above .",
    "based on the inverted spectrum from epoch 2000.02 , we anticipated dramatic behavior on the smallest of scales .",
    "thus , we proposed for two epochs of high frequency observations that were closely spaced in time , 2006.07 and 2006.32 .",
    "the observations were phase referenced to j1302 + 5748 at 15 , 22 and 43 ghz .",
    "we also gathered polarization data .",
    "there is no evidence that the flux density recovered at any of our frequencies was strongly dependent on the weighting used , indicating that we are dealing with two compact components with little , if any , diffuse flux on the range of spatial scales probed by these observations .",
    "the inability to phase self - calibrate at 43  ghz opens the possibility that some flux density may have been lost due to phase errors . in lieu of the undetected secondary calibrator , j1306 + 5529",
    ", one can use the secondary component to the sw in mrk231 as a crude amplitude calibrator . note",
    "the flux density of the secondary was the same between epochs 2000.02 and 2006.32 at 22  ghz to within a few percent in table 1 indicating that it is not strongly variable .",
    "therefore , we treat this component as approximately steady at high frequency and it can potentially serve as a crude calibrator for the core flux density at 43 ghz .",
    "the flux density of the secondary ( our crude high frequency amplitude calibrator ) measured at both epochs at 43  ghz agrees to within 1.2  mjy ( 0.6 sigma ) .",
    "this supports the suggestion that the phase referencing with respect to j1302 + 5748 recovered the majority of the flux at 43  ghz , and any amplitude loss due to phase errors is likely to be similar at the two epochs .",
    "we note that in epoch 2006.07 bad weather and technical problems allowed us to recover data from effectively just 5.25 of the 10 array antennas at 43  ghz , so these data have sparser u - v coverage and an increased rms noise level .",
    "our 43  ghz images in figure  [ 43ghzmaps ] show partial resolution of the core at epoch 2006.07 with an extension at pa = @xmath24 from ne to sw .",
    "unfortunately , we must consider this detection unreliable due to the poor beam shape and the low snr .",
    "we stress that the data from all 10 antennas were recovered at 43 ghz at epoch 2006.32 .",
    "this higher quality data is used extensively in section 5 .    in figures 5 and 6 , we plot the spectrum of the core and the secondary , respectively , for all three epochs of observation as well as the two archival data sets in @xcite .",
    "the core spectra in figure 5 are highly variable in magnitude .",
    "all the epochs reveal an optically thick core that is indicated by flat or inverted spectra in a finite band of frequency .",
    "clearly the most powerful epoch is 2006.32 which we explore in detail in section 5 .",
    "in contrast figure 6 shows that the secondary is optically thin , steep spectrum at all epochs .",
    "the data are supportive of a secondary that is mildly variable , characterized by changes of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) on time scales of 0.25 years , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) on time scales of 6 years and @xmath29 on time scales of 9.4 years .",
    "notice that the spectra show significant curvature , reflecting a deficit of high frequency flux relative to a power law extrapolated from lower frequency .",
    "an important part of this analysis is to try to determine the motion of the secondary relative to the core over the 9.4 year history of vlba observations that were capable of resolving the compact nuclear double ( i.e. , observations at @xmath30 15 ghz ) .",
    "the entries in tables 1 and 2 include the historical data from @xcite for this reason .",
    "it is clear that there is very little component motion .",
    "therefore , a careful analysis of the errors that arise in the determination of the component separation is critical .",
    "the displacements between the core and secondary are entered in table 2 .",
    "those entries in the first five rows have errors computed by a method that is based on the error in discerning the position of the centroid of an elliptical gaussian fit to the data in the presence of background noise ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath31^{0.5}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the error in the estimate of the separation in mas , @xmath33 is the beamwidth in mas and snr is the signal to noise ratio .",
    "notice that the component separations in table 2 widen with increasing observing frequency at each epoch as expected for an optically thick core @xcite .",
    "thus , in computing a change in the component separation between epochs a common frequency should be used .",
    "the lone common frequency of observation for all epochs is 15 ghz .",
    "however , the method described by equation ( 1 ) does not account for core subcomponents that flare on scales below the resolution limit of the beam without any actual motion occurring .",
    "if a subcomponent flares , the centroid of the elliptical fit of the core can shift in position and give the illusion of secondary motion .",
    "this is a concern for mrk 231 since figure clearly indicates the presence of strong core flares that are not resolved by vlbi .",
    "for example , the core flux density flares at 1998.71 relative to the flux density of the core at 1996.93 and the components appear to separate by 0.08 mas at 15 ghz according to table 2 .",
    "this can be described by the base of the jet at the far eastern edge of the core being the source of the flare with no actual secondary motion .",
    "the position of the elliptical fit just shifts to the east by about 0.08 mas , well below the resolution of the beam at 15 ghz or 22 ghz where the flare is detected .",
    "thus , we need an estimate of the error in component separation that incorporates the maximum size subcomponent flare in the core that can not be resolved with vlbi ( equivalently , the minimum size subcomponent that can be resolved by vlbi ) . comparing the maps of the compact double in @xcite at 15.3 ghz ( resolved ) , 8.4 ghz ( partially resolved ) and 5 ghz ( unresolved )",
    ", it appears that the uncertainty posed by unresolved subcomponents in the core will be about 1/2 - 1/3 of the beamwidth projected along the direction toward the secondary . fortuitously for the compact double in mrk 231",
    "this direction is close to the minor axis of the beam . in general , the minimum size subcomponent that is resolvable by vlbi will depend on the snr , so we look for a more general and quantitative formulation . to this end",
    "we invoke the technique of @xcite that considers the ability of an interferometer to resolve components modeled by elliptical fits in presence of noise assuming a rectangular power law interferometric visibility sampling function , @xmath34^{0.5}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in equation ( 2 ) , @xmath35 is the minimum size subcomponent in mas that can be resolved by the interferometer . in our calculations",
    "we have the weighting of the data , @xmath36 corresponding to unweighted data .",
    "the major axis and minor axis of the beam in mas are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath35 that we derive from equation ( 2 ) range from @xmath39 - @xmath40 for the observations in table 2 .",
    "we consider , @xmath35 an estimate of the uncertainty in the core position due to unresolved flaring subcomponents .",
    "the secondary does not flare , so we do not consider this a likely source of error in the position of the secondary .",
    "we add this error to the error introduced in equation ( 1 ) in quadrature ( @xmath35 is the dominant contributor ) .",
    "the results computed by the formula , ( 2 ) , are listed for the separation error on rows 6 - 10 of table 2 .",
    "they are large compared to the variations in the component separation between any pair of epochs .",
    "we conclude that the observations in table 2 are not precise enough to determine the rate of component separation , except as an upper limit determined by @xmath35 .",
    "the vlba observations indicate that the separation in components changed in 9.4 years ( from 1996.93 to 2006.32 ) by @xmath41 in arriving at the result given by equation ( 3 ) , we noted that the core at epoch 1996.93 was at an extreme historic low .",
    "thus , we do not consider core flares relevant in this quiescent state .",
    "therefore , we use the error derived from equation ( 1 ) that appears in the first row of table 2 as an accurate assessment of the error in the measured component separation at this epoch . at 2006.32",
    ", there is clearly a flare , so we use the 15 ghz entry derived from equation ( 2 ) that appears in row 10 of table 2 to estimate the error in the component separation at this epoch .",
    "the secondary separation in equation ( 3 ) equates to a time averaged secondary separation velocity , @xmath42 @xmath43 our data is consistent with no apparent motion of the secondary relative to the core .",
    "it should be remembered that @xmath42 is the projection of the separation velocity of the components onto the sky plane .",
    "table 2 indicates that the component separation increases with observing frequency at all epochs , this is expected in optically thick cores as the @xmath44 surface for synchrotron self absorption moves outward relative to the true core position with decreasing frequency @xcite . in order to ascribe",
    "a quantitative measure of this phenomena one must resort to highly model dependent estimates that involve much speculation about many unknown physical quantities that parameterize the putative jet @xcite . however ,",
    "notice that this variation is particularly pronounced at 2006.07 .",
    "furthermore , from figure 5 , the core is actually optically thin between 15 ghz and 22 ghz , yet there is an 84 @xmath6as differential in the component separations . in this section",
    "we study the ramifications of this to see if we can make some quantitative statements with a minimal amount of model dependent assumptions .",
    "we begin by overlaying the component positions on the 43 ghz radio image at epoch 2006.07 in figure 7 .",
    "the main issue is how does one register the image centers at different observing frequencies .",
    "this was not designed as an astrometric experiment and we do not have a good handle on the positional jitter that is induced by fluctuations in the tropospheric delay .    ostensibly there is no obvious way to place errors on the component positions in figure 7 .",
    "however , notice that the secondary components are fairly close in position .",
    "in fact we can argue that they should be even closer than this based on the steep spectrum in figure 6 .",
    "we seek to register all of the epoch 2006.07 radio images relative to the 22 ghz position of the unresolved secondary at 2006.07 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the region containing the plasma that emits the bulk of the 22 ghz secondary emission .",
    "for any reasonable ensemble of energetic particles , there must also be emission at 43 ghz and 15 ghz .",
    "first , consider the 43 ghz emission . the spectral index in figure 6 between 22 ghz and 43 ghz is incredibly steep , @xmath46 , where the spectral index is defined in terms of the flux density by the convention , @xmath47 . between 15 ghz and 22 ghz",
    "the spectral index is significantly flatter , but still very steep , @xmath48 .",
    "thus , unless there is an incredibly abrupt spectral break above 22 ghz and a second weak 43 ghz component , virtually all of the 43 ghz radiation from the secondary would be emitted from the particles in @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , we consider the assumption that the 43 ghz emitting electrons are co - spatial with the 22 ghz emitting plasma is most likely valid .",
    "we can not make the same argument for the 15 ghz emitting electrons .",
    "since the spectrum is so steep between 43 and 22 ghz and the spectrum above 22 ghz is also steep , we make the conservative assumption that the 15 ghz flux density from @xmath45 is at least as big as the 22 ghz flux density , 43.1 mjy . with this conservative assessment",
    ", we can estimate an upper bound on the error in the 15 ghz secondary position if it is re - registered co - spatially with the 22 ghz secondary position .",
    "namely , if the remaining 26.4 mjy of residual 15 ghz flux resides primarily in a disjoint component , @xmath49 , this would create the maximum offset in the true absolute position of the 15 ghz component position relative to @xmath45 .",
    "the 15 ghz secondary is unresolved in figure 2 , and according to @xcite and our own experience discussed in section 3 , if @xmath49 was half a beam width away from @xmath45 , the secondary would be partially resolved in the radio map at 15 ghz .",
    "there is no partially resolved component in figure 2 .",
    "thus , we can set an upper bound on the error in registering the 15 ghz secondary position to the 22 ghz position , by positing that 26.4 mjy of flux density arise from an optically thin component , @xmath49 , that lies one half of a beam width from @xmath45 ( which accounts for the remaining 43.1 mjy of the 15 ghz flux density of the secondary ) .",
    "then taking the flux density weighted average of the component positions ( i.e. , offset from @xmath45 = @xmath50 yields a conservative upper bound on the offset between the true 15 ghz position and the 22 ghz position .",
    "the resultant upper bound on the error in the re - registered 15 ghz position is 0.11 mas and 0.018 mas in the x and y directions , respectively .",
    "figure 8 is the figure 7 overlay re - registered to the 22 ghz secondary position ( i.e. , all three of the secondary positions agree ) .",
    "the errors on the re - registered 22 and 43 ghz core data points in figure 8 arise from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the error on the 22 ghz core position is too small to be seen in this figure .",
    "the re - registered map in figure 8 makes the component positions appear almost linear .",
    "we believe that our assignment of errors justifies further analysis of the frequency dependent component separation data .",
    "apparently , we have uncovered sub - structure on scales smaller than the 43 ghz beamwidth .",
    "but , unlike the optically thick case in which the core position movement reflects the location of the frequency dependent @xmath44 surface , the 2006.07 core spectrum is optically thin below 22 ghz and we are revealing direct data on the distribution of the synchrotron emitting gas . in particular ,",
    "the spread in the 15 ghz and 22 ghz core positions in figure 8 , reflects the fact that there are significant amounts of 22 ghz emitting plasma to the east of the plasma that emits the 15 ghz data .",
    "in fact , the spectrum in figure 5 and core component positions are well represented by a two component model .",
    "component a is located @xmath51 40 @xmath6as to the northeast of the 43 ghz core position , along a line connecting the three core position components and component b is @xmath51 40 @xmath6as to the southwest of the 15 ghz core position along the same axis .",
    "component a is synchrotron self absorbed with a peak flux density of @xmath51 27 mjy at @xmath51 32 ghz .",
    "component b is steep spectrum with @xmath52 .",
    "we only introduce the model to give a qualitative feel for the underlying substructure not to fine tune the parameters .",
    "this model explains the inflection point in the sed at epoch 2006.07 inferred from figure 5 and predicts @xmath51 3 mjy at 43 ghz in component b , similar to what we see in the southwest core extension in the radio image in figure 4 .",
    "again , we caution that this feature might just be phase noise . without a higher signal to noise detection",
    ", we can not say more .",
    "however , the spread in component positions and the sed are consistent with there being some emission in this region .",
    "the reason for pursuing this two component model in figure 8 is not to make precise statements about the components that are not directly detected , but to explore the more general implications of a core substructure at 2006.07 , composed of an optically thick component and a steep spectrum component , that is required to fit the sed . to this end",
    ", we plot the sed of the theoretical components a and b relative to the seds at 2006.07 and 2006.32 in figure 9 .",
    "the first deduction is that the flare at 2006.32 can not be created by the simple adiabatic expansion of the flaring core component a at 2006.07 .",
    "if it were simple adiabatic expansion of a flare that is peaked at 32 ghz at 2006.07 , then the optically thin flux at 43 ghz should be much weaker at 2006.32 , @xcite , but it is actually stronger .",
    "thus , the flare at 2006.32 requires a large injection of energetic particles and energy after 2006.07 .",
    "the second important implication is that component b is very steep spectrum above 15 ghz .",
    "figure 9 shows that there is some mechanism that causes the high energy spectrum to decay rapidly in the core of mrk 231 .",
    "all the components are extremely steep in the optically thin region , thus there is a very efficient cooling mechanism that preferentially cools the particles with the highest energy first .",
    "the most common mechanism in agn that fit this prescription are inverse compton cooling from a strong radiation field or synchrotron emission from a strong magnetic field .",
    "the cooling is so efficient that by the time that an ejection from the nucleus is far enough away so that it could be resolved by 43 ghz vlba , it is generally too weak to be detected .",
    "even with all 10 antennas working at peak efficiency , two good calibrators at 43 ghz and good weather , partial resolution of the ejecta might be the best one can do when studying flare evolution in the nucleus of mrk 231 .",
    "the next section is the main topic of this study .",
    "we explore the formation of the powerful flare at 2006.32 .",
    "furthermore , we try to get an understanding of the rapid cooling mechanism that causes drastic temporal changes in the emissivity of the ejected flares .",
    "the data in table 1 indicates that the ne component is highly variable and is likely associated with the agn nucleus .",
    "the two epochs of the observations , 2006.07 and 2006.32 , reveal a strong flare at 22 ghz that increased the flux density by 45 mjy in just 91 days .",
    "the inverted spectrum from 15 ghz to 22 ghz juxtaposed to the steep spectrum , @xmath53 , from 22 ghz to 43 ghz is extremely unusual for a radio source and provides a strong constraint on the nature of the flare that we exploit in this section .",
    "the steep spectrum above 22 ghz is inconsistent with free - free emission unless the temperature of the gas is @xmath54 k which is unlikely within a few pc of a quasar nucleus .",
    "thus , we consider synchrotron radiation as a more likely source of the emission .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the inverted spectrum near 22 ghz .",
    "first , the spectral luminosity , @xmath55 , might be seen through a free - free absorbing ( ffa ) screen . for a powerlaw synchrotron spectrum seen through a ffa gas with number density of free electrons , @xmath56 , temperature , @xmath57 , and thickness in parsecs , @xmath58",
    ", we adopt the following expressions from @xcite , @xmath59\\\\ & & \\kappa(\\nu ) = 9.8 \\times 10^{-3}l_{\\mathrm{pc } } n_{e}^{2 } t^{-1.5}\\nu^{-2}[17.7 + \\ln ( t^{1.5}\\nu^{-1})]\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have only three data points in table 1 , the flux densities at 15 , 22 and 43 ghz of the core . if we rewrite the free - free opacity as @xmath60 $ ] , we can separate out the frequency dependence , where the coefficient @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that the emission region is a homogeneous sphere ejected along the jet direction toward the secondary .",
    "this is certainly more accurate than a continuous jet for emission that shows no evidence in figure 5 or table 1 of being quasi - steady .",
    "the lack of protracted periods of quasi - steady flux is in contradiction to what would be expected from a large smoothly varying structure , like the jet models in @xcite .",

    "it seems unlikely ( but not impossible ) that a radio quiet quasar should have flares with a strong fr ii kinetic energy flux .",
    "based on these two considerations , it seems difficult to reconcile the large kinetic energy flux with a doppler factor of order unity in mrk 231 .",

    "small deviations in the line of sight can greatly alter the flux density since by equation ( 12 ) , @xmath167 .",

    "similarly , a strong dependence on @xmath74 is compatible with the extreme flares and spectral variations that appear in table 1 .",
    "it seems likely that the subparsec scale radio jet in mrk 231 is highly doppler enhanced , i.e. relativistic and viewed pole - on .",

    "the time variablity brightness temperature is @xmath169 k. in order to avoid the inverse compton catastrophe , the analysis in @xcite indicates that the line of sight to the jet is less than @xmath170 .",

    "epoch 2006.67 ( ba80b ) .",
    "the historic high levels of 8 ghz of core flux density at 2006.67 indicated in table 1 and figure 5 is supportive of the flare evolving to lower frequency 0.35 years later . unfortunately we could not recover the 15 ghz data at 2006.67 which would have told us much more .",
    "in this section we study the interaction of the secondary component with the surrounding medium .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , using low frequency ( 1.4 ghz - 15.3 ghz ) vlba observations that the compact radio double is seen through a ffa shroud .",
    "the ffa absorption creates a spectral turnover near 6 ghz . from table 1 , it is clear that the radio emission of the compact double is dominated by the secondary at low frequency .",
    "thus , the emission measure ( see equation ( 6 ) , @xmath171 ) , that is calculated in @xcite from this 6 ghz peak in the spectrum represents the shroud of gas that envelopes the secondary and might not be indicative of the gas density surrounding the core . in @xcite , it was stated that @xmath172 produced the spectral turnover .",
    "however , it was not clear what temperature was assumed for the gas .",
    "thus , we re - derive this result in a form that incorporates the temperature .    in order to study the spectral turnover ,",

    "our best fit used a covering factor , @xmath174 .",
    "the corresponding solution for the emission measure is close to the value stated in @xcite , @xmath175    considering that the secondary is surrounded by a dense cloud of free electrons as indicated in equation ( 22 ) and the secondary does not move appreciably according to table 2 , even though the core jet is relativistic , it is natural to consider the possibility that the secondary is being braked to a slow speed by the surrounding gas that supports @xmath56 . in physical language , is the pressure of the secondary in dynamic equilibrium with the ram pressure of the surrounding gas ? to explore this possibility we first try to estimate the pressure within the secondary .    to estimate the pressure , we first find the @xmath160 associated with the secondary and use the physical size to convert it to a pressure . since the secondary is very steep spectrum at all epochs and is mildly variable , we consider it to be a compact analog of the radio lobes that are seen in classical double radio sources",
    ". offset from the sub - pc scale jet direction .",
    "the very steep spectral index in figure 6 , above 8.4 ghz ( which equates to a background spectral index of @xmath176 in the ffa fit above ) , seems more indicative of lobe emission than knot emission .",
    "for such a steep spectrum structure , the distinction of knot or lobe is probably irrelevant with respect to the application of estimate of the jet kinetic energy flux in equation ( 23 ) ] furthermore , this compact lobe is seen through the effects of a ffa shroud and we can not detect its low frequency emission , even though it is plausibly @xmath177 jy considering the 8.4 ghz flux density in table 1 .",
    "perhaps the most sophisticated estimate of jet kinetic energy flux was developed by @xcite which incorporates deviations from the overly simplified minimum energy estimates .",
    "the method also considers geometric effects , filling factors , protonic contributions and low frequency cutoff .",
    "the long term time average of the jet kinetic energy flux of a steep spectrum radio lobe , @xmath178 , is estimated in @xcite : @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the total optically thin luminosity from the lobes in units of @xmath181 at 151 mhz .",
    "the obstacle to implementing equation ( 23 ) is that it depends on the 151 mhz flux density .",
    "this is problematic since the 151 mhz flux from the secondary is blocked from our view by the ffa shroud .",
    "the lowest frequency measurement that we have in table 1 is 8.4 ghz and we need to extrapolate this value to 151 mhz .",
    "we know that the spectrum is very steep between 8.4 ghz and 15 ghz , @xmath182 , even with some diminished flux at 8.4 ghz from ffa .",
    "there are very few ( if any ) known radio lobes that are this steep between 151 mhz and 8.4 ghz .",
    "thus , there is no justification for extrapolating the 8.4 ghz flux density with @xmath182 .",
    "a more typical value for steep lobe emission seems to be @xmath183 @xcite . under this assumption",
    ", we used table 1 and equation ( 23 ) to estimate the long term time average kinetic energy flux of the putative jet connecting the core to the secondary , @xmath184 .    even though this estimate of @xmath178 is crude",
    ", we can use it to estimate the pressure in the secondary .",
    "we can approximate the energy flux through the jet as @xmath185 , where d is the diameter of the lobe , @xmath42 is the velocity that the lobe is advancing into the external medium and @xmath186 is the total internal energy density .",

    "we also get a value of @xmath193 from the angular size of the emission region , 0.31 mas ( this was determined from model fits to the 15 ghz vlba data by @xcite and was verified by our fits in various epochs as well )",
    ". we can then solve ( 25 ) with these parameters derived from the ffa fit and the vlba data to get a qualitative understanding of the ram pressure confinement of the lobe .",
    "we explore equation ( 25 ) in two limits , first the enveloping gas is stagnant @xmath194 which yields @xmath195 = 3490 km / sec .",
    "secondly , we note that the distance from the secondary to the core is typical for the location of the lobal gas .",
    "the velocity of the mgii absorption trough relative to the h@xmath64 emission ( which we take as an approximation to the quasar rest frame ) from @xcite can be equated with the velocity of the enveloping medium , @xmath196 , from which equation ( 25 ) implies that @xmath197 = 7570 km / sec .",
    "these values are consistent with the slow advance speed indicated in table 2 .",
    "the dynamic estimates correspond to a separation increase between the core and the secondary in 9.4 years of @xmath198 mas and @xmath199 mas , respectively ( where @xmath77 is the angle between the line of sight and the jet propagation axis ) .",
    "these values are consistent with our observations which by equation ( 4 ) bounds @xmath200 , at the one sigma level .    in summary ,",
    "the relativistic jet is over - pressurized relative to the gas density of the ffa absorbing gas , so it advances .",
    "however , the ffa gas is very dense and the kinetic energy flux is modest , thus the jet can drill through the dense medium relatively slowly at a non - relativistic rate .",
    "independent of the assumptions involved in deriving and evaluating equation ( 25 ) , this qualitative conclusion is robust and is consistent with the observed vlba component separation data in table 2 .",
    "this analysis raises the question , what is the medium that is confining the relativistic jet and braking its velocity to a virtual halt ?",
    "is it the putative dusty molecular torus , @xmath194 , or is it the bal gas , @xmath201 ?",
    "we argue that the ffa absorbing screen is more likely the bal gas than the molecular torus based on the following points .    * the low frequency vlbi observations of @xcite led them to conclude that  the lack of 21 cm absorption or maser amplification against the compact core ( which is the compact double with our higher resolution ) shows that the molecular disk does not cover the central source . \"",
    "* the high doppler factor inferred from our modeling of the core flare indicates that the jet is viewed in a nearly pole - on orientation .",
    "furthermore , the existence of bal troughs in the spectrum of mrk 231 indicates that our line of sight is through the bal gas .",
    "thus , the jet direction seems pass through the bal gas on pc scales .    in summary ,",
    "the observational data is consistent with the jet ramming through the bal gas and inconsistent with the jet plowing through the molecular disk .",
    "thus , we proceed to consider the bal gas as the ffa medium .",
    "if the jet is ramming through the bal gas then the jet can be used as a remote probe of properties of the bal region .",
    "thus , mrk 231 might be uniquely suited for studying the bal gas .",
    "we find that the properties of the gas derived in this section are consistent with published interpretations of balqso physics .",

    "we interpret this value of @xmath203 within the context of the polar models of bal outflows flows in @xcite . consider a conical outflow that experiences very little acceleration as might be the case in the lobal region ( near uv lines ) since most of the line driving acceleration is provided by far uv and euv absorption lines @xcite . in this scenario , by conservation of mass , @xmath206 and we can integrate the emission measure in general form as @xmath207 where the observed @xmath208 is the projection of @xmath203 in the sky plane and @xmath77 is the angle to the line of sight to the radio jet axis ( symmetry axis of the bal outflow ) . in @xcite , it was calculated that @xmath209 was typical for a lobal or from table 2 , @xmath210 pc and from equations ( 22 ) and ( 25 ) , @xmath211 .",

    "the implication was that these balqsos must have civ @xmath2151548 , 1550 troughs that are completely saturated with the bottoms of the troughs filled in by scattered light and un - attenuated ( or mildly attenuated ) lines of sight that are a consequence of partial covering of the central agn by the predominant thick absorber .",
    "after , numerically modeling the absorption region , @xcite found that the civ @xmath2171548 1550 troughs are saturated as a consequence of absorption presented by a column that contained almost completely ionized hydrogen , @xmath218 .",

    "it was concluded that these large column densities are likely common in bal regions .",
    "based on the analysis of @xcite , the values of @xmath214 determined by equation ( 27 ) are typical of many balqso absorbing columns .",
    "furthermore , we remind the reader that there is very little neutral hydrogen absorption towards the nuclear secondary as noted in @xcite . yet by equations ( 22 ) and ( 27 ) there are large values of em and @xmath214 which implies that the intervening hydrogen column density must be almost completely ionized as expected from the ionization models of dense bal winds in @xcite . in particular , the photo - ionization models of @xcite yield a range of allowed ionization states : for a total hydrogen column density of @xmath219 ,",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density is quite small , @xmath220 .    from our analysis above",
    ", we have enough parameters to estimate the kinetic energy flux of the the bal wind , @xmath221 in terms of the parameters of the enveloping gas surrounding the leading edge of the secondary .",
    "first , assume that the bal wind has a bulk velocity in the range of velocity spread given by the mgii bal absorbing gas and nai d absorbing gas relative to the quasar rest frame , @xmath222 .",
    "from the numerical models in @xcite , a polar lobal wind will have an opening angle of @xmath223 . combining this opening angle and the bal wind velocity with the 3.75 pc displacement from the nucleus and @xmath224 yields @xmath225 .",
    "it is curious that this is similar to the kinetic energy flux of the relativistic flare that was discussed in section 5 .",
    "one can compare this parametric analysis , with the theoretical polar bal models in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "first of all , for the numerical models , the kinetic energy flux in the bal wind solutions is @xmath226 , in agreement with what we deduced for mrk 231 .",
    "however , the mass density in the bal wind of mrk 231 is estimated to be a factor of 10 - 50 times larger than that which is predicted by mass conservation in the numerical models .",
    "a possible explanation of the additional gas density is that the polar bal entrains gas as it propagates through the surrounding medium .",
    "this seems reasonable on two counts .",
    "first of all , there is the dusty , enveloping gas that partially obscures the nuclear region and reddens the spectrum .",
    "this gas distribution could be a consequence of the merger that is in progress with a nearby smaller galaxy to the south @xcite .",
    "so there is a potential for significant gas entrainment .",
    "secondly , the bal absorption is deep , but not particularly blue - shifted for a balqso , only about 5000 km / s : this is consistent with a resistive drag resulting from mass loading of the wind .",
    "in this article , we used high frequency vlba observations to determine that the central engine of the nearby balqso mrk 231 , ejects relativistic plasma along a trajectory close to the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , it appears that this jet is interacting strongly with the dense bal gas at a de - projected distance @xmath17 3 - 4 pc from the radio core .",
    "the most striking finding was the strong 22 ghz flare that emerged from the core between epochs 2006.07 and 2006.32 .",
    "the core spectrum , during the flare , is characterized by extreme gradients , namely it transitions from being very steep spectrum , @xmath227 above 22 ghz to being inverted @xmath228 at @xmath229 ghz .",
    "the magnitude of the flare combined with the three month interval between observations sets a lower bound on the time variability brightness temperature of @xmath230 , below the inverse compton limit , @xmath231 .",
    "however , all attempts in section 5 to model the high frequency peak of the spectral turnover , 19.5 ghz , in combination with the steep spectral index above 22 ghz ( @xmath227 ) indicate that the flare is synchrotron self - absorbed and @xmath232 , unless the flux density is doppler boosted .",
    "our doppler boosted models indicate a kinetic energy flux , @xmath1 and an intrinsic ( rest frame of the plasma ) brightness temperature @xmath233 .",
    "our discovery of a relativistic jet in a radio quiet quasar does not stand alone .",
    "there are the aforementioned balqsos in @xcite as well as pg 1407 + 263 in @xcite and iii zw 2 in @xcite . by definition ,",
    "most radio quiet quasars are weak radio sources , so there are not many observations with vlbi .",
    "consequently , we can not say if the relativistic jets that have been detected are more the exception or the rule .",
    "the compact nature of the jet emission in mrk231 and the strong interaction with the surrounding medium has many strong similarities to ghz peaked ( gps ) radio sources @xcite . in the interval between 2006.07 and 2006.32 ,",
    "mrk 231 seemed to transform from a weak version of a gps source ( as it was in 1996.93 ) to a weak version of a rare class of radio sources known as high frequency peakers , but on a scale 1000 times smaller @xcite .",
    "it is weakly polarized like gps sources , but unlike gps sources mrk 231 is highly variable @xcite .",
    "we were unable to reliably detect any morphological changes associated with this change in character .",
    "it would be interesting to see if long term vlba monitoring at 43 ghz and 22 ghz would reveal ejecta emanating from the core @xmath17 a month after a flare .",
    "another interesting aspect of high frequency vlba monitoring would be to understand the flare growth and decay time scales .",
    "the information gleaned from this data would further constrain the physical model of section 5 .",
    "this monitoring would undoubtedly reveal large time variability brightness temperatures and might confirm the presence of synchrotron cooling , i.e. is there a short lived 43 ghz precursor to a 22 ghz flare .",
    "if the basic ssa model of the flare that was presented in section 5 is confirmed by these observations , a natural question arises : what is the origin of the strong magnetic field , @xmath17 a few g , on scales approaching @xmath234 cm ?",
    "if the field propagates from the base of the jet , does it tell us something about the turbulent plasma inside the accretion disk ?",
    "another important finding was that the core was unpolarized even during a flare .",
    "this implies that the magnetic field is not ordered or there is a huge amount of weakly magnetized gas around the central engine which depolarizes the synchrotron emission by faraday rotation .",
    "the arguments in section 5 , regarding @xmath138 seemed to favor magnetically dominated models .",
    "it is hard to understand how a strong field would not be ordered in a magnetically dominated plasma .",
    "this would seem to indicate a dense magnetized envelope surrounding the radio core . perhaps this is the source of the seed field that is ultimately responsible for the strong magnetic field in the core flares .",
    "it is intriguing that in spite of the highly relativistically beamed doppler core that the steep spectrum secondary ( @xmath235 ) is mildly variable and has very little apparent motion .",
    "this peculiar situation was studied in section 6 .",
    "a standard estimate of the long term time averaged kinetic energy flux of the secondary reveals @xmath236 which is consistent with the core having episodic flares of @xmath237 , if the two components are part of the same jetted beam of plasma .",
    "thus , we established consistency between the analysis of the core in section 5 and the kinetic energy flux of the secondary that was estimated in section 6 .",
    "we also noted that matched ( to 5 ghz ) resolution vlba observations indicates that the secondary is seen through a shroud of free - free absorbing gas with an emission measure of @xmath238 .",
    "we argue that the steep spectrum secondary seems to be a radio lobe associated with the jet advancing into a dense medium ( the jet is confined by ram pressure ) that is also the source of the free - free absorption .",
    "the properties of the dense gas are consistent with a temperature , @xmath239 , a displacement from the nucleus , 3 - 4 pc , and a total hydrogen column density , @xmath240 .",
    "these gas parameters are often associated with the bal wind @xcite .",
    "the implied kinetic luminosity of this bal wind is within the narrow range of values that are predicted by the polar bal wind theory in @xcite .",
    "the density is at least an order of magnitude larger than what is expected from such a wind , indicating that there is substantial gas entrainment as the bal wind propagates outward from the nucleus .",
    "the jet in mrk 231 might offer a unique opportunity to study the central dynamics of a radio quiet quasar .",
    "not only is the quasar near to earth , but the jet is the brightest at high frequency of any radio quiet quasar jet .",
    "thus , no other radio quiet quasar central engine can be explored with such high resolution ( vlbi ) .",
    "furthermore , now we know the orientation of the jet . the high resolution of 43 ghz vlba allows us to peer into the inner regions of this quasar , using the relativistic jet as a probe of the x - ray emitting gas , the x - ray absorbing gas , and the bal wind . in summary , there are many potential discoveries that can be made with future vlba monitoring coordinated with observations at other frequency bands .",
    "our observations lead us to ask the the following questions    1 .",
    "is there more evidence of superluminal motion , like apparent velocities of radio emission larger than the speed of light that can be detected ? 2 .",
    "what is the maximum kinetic energy flux of the high frequency flares ?",
    "3 .   are these types of flares present in other radio quiet quasars , but with varying magnitude ? 4 .",
    "why are the flares so powerful , yet cool off so fast that mrk 231 never becomes a strong fr",
    "i radio source ? more specifically ,",
    "why do all the components in the the core and secondary seem to show such steep high frequency spectra ? what is the powerful cooling mechanism ? 5 .",
    "is this cooling mechanism found in all radio quiet quasars and why does it not occur in radio loud quasars ? 6 .   is the gas that entrains the secondary one and the same as the bal gas ?",
    "how fast do strong flares grow and what are the details of their rapid decay ? 8 .",
    "do the detected ( but absorbed ) x - rays come primarily from the same plasma that is responsible for the 22 ghz flares ( i.e. , the accretion disk x - rays are completely attenuated ) ?",
    "do we see correlated flares in the x - ray and microwave bands ? 9 .",
    "since the microwave flare emission is from such small scales , it is nearly coincident with the scales of x - ray emission and absorption .",
    "thus , can we expect a strong interplay between microwave flares and the x - ray spectral properties of mrk231 ? 10 .",
    "if the x - rays in mrk 231 are predominantly inverse compton emission from the microwave jet , does the dense x - ray absorption column constrain the physical parameters of the enveloping medium that gets entrained by the propagating jet and thwarts it propagation to large scales ? 11 .",
    "does a strong microwave flare blast holes in the x - ray absorbing column allowing us to get a brief mildly attenuated glimpse of the x - ray emission from the accretion disk corona ? 12 .",
    "do flares in the microwave correspond to a decrease in the x - ray emission of the accretion disk corona as has been hypothesized as a universal phenomenon in black hole accretion systems ( the  low - hard \" state)@xcite ?",
    "based on these considerations that were raised by our observations , it seems clear that a coordinated observing program of vlba and x - ray observations would shed light on many of these issues , in particular points 8 to 12 . generally speaking , coincident x - ray and vlba monitoring",
    "is potentially a powerful method of studying any  disk - jet connection . \"",
