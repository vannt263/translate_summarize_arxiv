    "within the gravitational instability framework for the growth of cosmic structures , the peculiar velocity field of galaxies and clusters is a direct probe of density fluctuations of the underlying mass distribution . among several possible statistics that can be used , measurements of the bulk motion amplitude on different scales are the simplest and provide , at least in principle , constraints on the power - spectrum of mass fluctuations .",
    "this has motivated several attempts to measure the dipole component of the local peculiar velocity field and to determine the volume within which the streaming motion vanishes in the restframe defined by the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) . at this distance",
    "the distribution of matter within the encompassing volume should explain the @xmath8  motion of the local group relative to the cmb restframe .",
    "observational searches of large - scale flows date back to the pioneering work of rubin ( 1976 ) . since then , redshift - distance surveys have greatly expanded , the data quality has improved significantly , and several recent attempts have been made using different techniques and samples ( strauss & willick 1995 ) . despite these efforts , the results remain to a large extent controversial . the original claim that the flowfield out to @xmath9is characterized by a coherent , large - amplitude @xmath10  streaming motion ( dressler 1987 ) relative to the cmb was revised to incorporate a large concentration of mass , the so - called great attractor ( hereafter ga ) , near @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( lynden - bell 1988 ) .",
    "more recent claims for the existence of a large amplitude flow @xmath13  , with a coherence length of @xmath14 1001 mpc ( willick 1990 ; mathewson , ford & buchhorn 1992 ) , suggesting excess power on very large scales , have also received reconsideration from the following standpoints .",
    "first , a careful re - analysis of the available data yielded a significantly smaller bulk velocity ( courteau 1993 ) .",
    "second , the analysis of the independent sfi ( @xmath15-band field spiral ) tf - survey led to a different characterization of the flowfield .",
    "indeed , the sfi velocity field shows that the flow is not as coherent as originally envisioned , exhibiting along the supergalactic plane a bifurcation towards the great attractor and perseus - pisces , similar to that predicted from reconstructions of the surveys ( da costa 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , the flow within 6000  is characterized by a strong shear across the volume , in contrast to the picture of a coherent motion of all structures .",
    "recent analyses based on the re - calibrated mark  iii catalogs lead to a roughly consistent picture to that obtained with sfi ( da costa 1996 ; dekel 1999 ) , even though some discrepancies still remain . for instance , mark  iii yields a systematically larger amplitude of the bulk motion @xmath16  on scales @xmath14 5000  as compared to values @xmath17  obtained by applying different techniques to the sfi sample ( da costa 1996 ; giovanelli 1998a ) . in particular",
    ", a direct fit to the sfi radial velocities yields a bulk velocity of @xmath18  within the sphere of radius @xmath19  consistent with that obtained from the sci cluster sample ( giovanelli 1998b ) .",
    "these results suggest that a significant fraction of the lg motion is generated on scales @xmath20  . while recent direct measurements of the bulk velocity on larger scales ( dale 1999 ) suggest that this may indeed be the case , other works ( lauer & postman 1994 ; willick 1999 ; hudson 1999 ) argue for the existence of large amplitude ( @xmath21  ) streaming motions out to a depth of 15,000  .",
    "in this paper we use the recently completed all - sky , homogeneous redshift - distance survey of early - type galaxies ( enear , da costa 2000 , hereafter paper  i ) to study the dipole component of the peculiar velocity field within @xmath22  .",
    "our main goal is to compare our results using an entirely independent sample to those obtained by existing tully - fisher surveys .",
    "in the present analysis , we use the enear redshift - distance survey described in greater detail in paper  i of this series .",
    "briefly , the enear sample consists of @xmath141600 early - type galaxies brighter than @xmath1 and with @xmath23 7000  , with distances available for 1359 galaxies . of these",
    "1145 were deemed suitable for peculiar velocity analysis ( paper  i ) . to the magnitude - limited sample we added 285 galaxies fainter and/or with redshifts @xmath24  , 129 within the same volume as the magnitude - limited sample . in total ,",
    "the cluster sample consists of 569 galaxies in 28 clusters , which are used to derive the distance relation . over 80% of the galaxies in the magnitude - limited sample and roughly 60% of the cluster galaxies",
    "have new spectroscopic and r - band photometric data obtained as part of this program .",
    "furthermore , repeated observations of several galaxies in the sample provide overlaps between observations conducted with different telescope / instrument configurations and with data available from other authors .",
    "these overlaps are used to tie all measurements into a common system , thereby ensuring the homogeneity of the entire dataset .",
    "in contrast to other samples new observations conducted by the same group are available over the entire sky .",
    "the comparison between the sample of galaxies with distances and the parent catalog also shows that the sampling across the sky is uniform .",
    "individual galaxy distances were estimated from a direct template relation derived by combining all the available cluster data , corrected for incompleteness and associated diameter - bias ( lynden - bell 1988 ) .",
    "the construction of the template relation was carried out following giovanelli ( 1997 ) . from the observed scatter of the template relation",
    "the estimated fractional error in the inferred distance of a galaxy is @xmath25 , nearly independent of the velocity dispersion .",
    "since early - type galaxies are found preferentially in high - density regions , galaxies have been assigned to groups / clusters using well - defined criteria imposed on their projected separation and velocity difference relative to the center of groups and clusters , as described in paper  i. early - type galaxies in a group / cluster are replaced by a single object having : ( 1 ) the redshift given by the group s mean redshift , which is determined considering all morphologies ; ( 2 ) the distance given by the error - weighted mean of the inferred distances , for groups with two or more early - types ; and ( 3 ) the fractional distance error given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of early - types in the group . in some cases groups were identified with abell / aco clusters within the same volume as the enear sample and fainter cluster galaxies were added , as described in paper  i.    the inferred distances are corrected for the homogeneous and inhomogeneous malmquist bias ( imb ) .",
    "the latter was estimated using the pcsz density field ( branchini 1999 ) , corrected for peculiar velocity effects , following willick ( 1997 ) . in this calculation",
    "we also include the correction for the sample redshift limit .",
    "it should be noted that this is an approximation as early - types are biased relative to galaxies .",
    "a complete description of the sample used and the corrections applied will be presented in a subsequent paper of this series . as an illustration of the velocity field mapped by the enear objects we show in figure  [ fig : all ] the projected distribution of objects in galactic coordinates with the sample split into different distance shells .",
    "the different symbols distinguish between objects with positive ( crosses ) and negative peculiar velocities ( circles ) .",
    "the peculiar velocities are relative to the cmb restframe and have been computed from fully corrected distances as described above . for an alternative view of the data we refer the reader to paper  i. in figure  [ fig : all ] structures such as the ga at @xmath28 , @xmath29 and",
    "the perseus - pisces ( pp ) complex at @xmath30 , @xmath31 are easily recognized in the two outermost shells .",
    "note that in these directions one finds evidence of outflow and infall as expected around mass concentrations .",
    "as will be shown in a later paper of this series , the presence of mass concentration in the pp region is confirmed from the reconstruction of the three - dimensional velocity field and mass distribution which shows that both structures have comparable peak density contrasts .",
    "the prominence of the pp complex is perhaps the most significant difference between the reconstructions based on the enear and the 7s samples .",
    "the enear reconstructed fields are also in good agreement with those obtained from the pscz redshift survey ( branchini 1999 ) , corrected for peculiar velocities , as it will be shown in a forthcoming paper .",
    "one of the primary goals of the enear survey has been to investigate the robustness of previous peculiar velocity analyses using an independent and uniform sample of early - type galaxies probing a comparable volume as the recently completed tf - surveys . while many tests are possible and will be explored in more detail in separate papers ( borgani 2000 ) , here we consider the dipole component of the velocity field .",
    "a bulk flow model is the simplest way to globally characterize the velocity field , having been extensively used in previous work ( dekel 1999 for a recent review ) . to determine the best - fitting bulk flow we minimize ( lynden - bell 1988 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the radial component of the peculiar velocity of the @xmath34 object in the cmb restframe , located in the direction @xmath35",
    ", @xmath36 is the bulk flow and @xmath37 is the weight given to the @xmath34 object in the sample . in our calculations we use either uniform ( equal ) weights @xmath38 or @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , is the sum in quadrature of the distance and redshift errors ( the latter is negligible in the case of field objects ) , and @xmath41 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion due to true velocity noise generated on small scales .",
    "table  [ tab : bulk ] summarizes the bulk flow results obtained using various sub - samples extracted from the combined sample of 696 objects within different volumes .",
    "the table gives for each volume of radius @xmath42 in units of , the number of objects in each sub - sample , the amplitude and direction of the best - fitting bulk motion , and their respective errors , obtained using different weighting schemes .",
    "the amplitude of the bulk motion is relative to the cmb restframe and its direction is expressed in terms of the galactic longitude and latitude .",
    "the errors were estimated from 1000 monte - carlo realizations generated by adding gaussian random deviates of the distance errors to the original distances , from which the dispersion of the dipole components are calculated . in the table ,",
    "the weighted solutions assume a thermal component of @xmath43  which is combined with the object s distance errors in quadrature .",
    "the bulk amplitudes listed in table  [ tab : bulk ] have been corrected for the error - bias obtained subtracting from the square of the best - fitting value of the bulk velocity the sum in quadrature of the errors in each cartesian component ( lauer & postman 1994 ) .",
    "the amplitude of this correction is relatively small @xmath14 50 .",
    "we point out that the amplitude of the bulk velocity at 6000  is insensitive to the malmquist bias correction .",
    "the comparison between the results obtained using raw distances , with those corrected only for homogeneous malmquist bias ( hmb ) and those obtained using the full correction , are comparable to the estimated errors in the bulk velocity .",
    "typical values for the hmb and imb corrections are 13% and 4% , respectively .",
    "only the direction of the dipole shows some dependence on the adopted correction . in particular , neglecting the imb correction yields lower values of @xmath44 .",
    "the good agreement between the direction of the fully corrected enear and those of sfi and mark  iii , using different procedures to estimate the imb , is reassuring .    from the direct fit of the radial velocities using equal weights we find @xmath45 in the direction @xmath46 , @xmath47 within a radius of @xmath0 .",
    "note that this value is smaller than the preliminary value reported earlier by wegner ( 1999 ) which was not corrected for the error - bias and was determined before the full sample had been assembled .",
    "a somewhat larger value is obtained when objects are weighted by their distance errors , but the amplitude is still less than 300  and essentially in the same direction .",
    "the direction of the enear dipole is compared in figure  [ fig : simul ] to other recent estimates measured on similar scales ( @xmath48  ) using the sfi ( giovanelli 1998a ) and the revised mark  iii ( dekel 1999 ) samples .",
    "the contours represent the 1 - 3@xmath41 confidence levels , derived from the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result is the excellent agreement both in direction and amplitude between the enear and sfi dipole solutions , probably the two most homogeneous all - sky samples currently available for the analysis of peculiar velocity data . particularly important",
    "is the well known fact that early - type ( e and s0 ) and late - type ( sc ) galaxies probe distinct regions of the galaxy distribution - while spirals are found predominantly in low - density regions and are more uniformly distributed , the distribution of ellipticals is clumpier , delineating more clearly the most prominent nearby structures . equally important",
    "is the fact that the peculiar velocities used in the two studies are based on independent distance relations involving different measurements and corrections . in figure",
    "[ fig : simul ] we also show the direction of the dipoles recently measured on larger scales .",
    "the results obtained on scales of @xmath3  are consistent , both in direction and amplitude , with those measured on much larger scales using the sci+scii sample .",
    "combined these results suggest that while most of the lg motion stems from fluctuations within 6000  some contribution also comes from larger scales where a better agreement between the dipole direction and the lg motion is found .",
    "it is important to note , however , that currently there is very little agreement among various determinations of the dipole on scales @xmath49 10,000  .    to evaluate the possible impact of sampling effects directly from the data , we have also computed the dipole solution splitting the sample into field galaxies and groups / clusters .",
    "we find that for @xmath50  6000  these sub - samples yield bulk velocities of @xmath51  for groups / clusters and @xmath52  for field galaxies , with errors of the order of @xmath53  .",
    "these velocities are somewhat higher ( @xmath54  ) when the objects are weighted by their distance error . however , in this case the mean weighted depth is small , for instance , @xmath55  in the case of field galaxies .",
    "the results obtained for field galaxies and groups / clusters are , individually , in good agreement with the amplitude and direction of the dipole obtained from tf surveys ( giovanelli 1998a ) .",
    "we conclude that on scales of @xmath56  the sampling error is small and comparable to the estimated random error of the bulk velocity ( @xmath5740  ) . adding this value in quadrature to that estimated from the simulations we estimate the random error to be @xmath58  .",
    "another potential source of error in the bulk velocity are systematic uncertainties in the distance arising from mismatches in the velocity dispersion scale .",
    "typically , the correction applied to @xmath41 for different runs is less than 0.020  dex with an uncertainty of 0.009 - 0.018  dex , which in principle could lead to large errors in the amplitude of the bulk flow .",
    "however , given the large number of runs covering each region of sky and the fact that the observed galaxies in each run were selected randomly , we estimate this contribution to be at most @xmath59  in each hemisphere . on the other hand , the uncertainty in the offset between measurements of the velocity dispersion from northern and southern observations is estimated to be @xmath57  0.006  dex , as determined from the a sample of galaxies observed from both hemispheres .",
    "this uncertainty corresponds to about 1.5% in distance or to @xmath14 50  , which we take as an an upper limit to the systematic error in the measured bulk velocity .",
    "using a sample of 1274 early - type galaxies in 696 objects comprising 414 isolated galaxies and 282 groups / clusters , drawn from the recently completed all - sky enear redshift - distance survey , we have computed the dipole component of the local velocity field to a depth of @xmath56  .",
    "our main conclusion is that the streaming motion amplitude of the ensemble of galaxies within the largest volume considered is small @xmath14 200  .",
    "similar small amplitudes are obtained when the sample is split into isolated galaxies and groups / clusters , indicating that sampling effects are relatively minor on these scales .",
    "the amplitude and direction of the enear dipole agree well with the results obtained from similar analysis using the sfi tf - survey .",
    "this is a remarkable result since these samples consider galaxies of different morphological types sampling different regions of space , were selected using different criteria , and the peculiar velocities are derived using different distance relations .",
    "small bulk velocities have also recently been obtained using new tf data ( courteau 2000 ) as well as other distance indicators ( see dekel 1999 for a review ) . if these results are confirmed , the peculiar velocity field observed locally can easily be accounted for by the currently popular cosmological models .",
