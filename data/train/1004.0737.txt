    "einstein s general relativity is not only the most successful classical theory of gravity in four dimensions , it is also the simplest theory possessing some nice properties .",
    "the two of the most important characteristics being general covariance and second order field equations .",
    "in fact , it was shown by lovelock that , in four dimensions , general relativity is the unique generally covariant theory of gravity ( upto an addition of a cosmological constant ) which gives second order equations of motion @xcite . however , in higher dimensions , there exists higher curvature theories , namely the lovelock theories , which also gives second order field equations .",
    "these theories are generically characterized by higher curvature invariants in the action . at each order @xmath0 ,",
    "the combination of higher curvature invariants is unique , the integral of which on a compact manifold of dimension @xmath1 gives the euler characteristic of the manifold .",
    "there are also other interesting characteristics of the lovelock class of theories . primarily , exact analytic black hole solutions are known to exist @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "black holes are widely believed to exist in nature as a final state of a gravitational collapse .",
    "they are also the simplest objects to study in any gravitational theory . therefore , exact black hole solutions are of significant importance .",
    "more recently , in the context of ads / cft correspondence , exact asymptotically ads black hole solutions in a gravity theory have been proven to be useful in studying the holographic properties of a finite temperature conformal field theory on the boundary @xcite .",
    "secondly , the lovelock theories also admit birkhoff s theorem , which states that any solution which has spherical , planar or hyperbolic symmetry must be locally isometric to the corresponding static black hole solution @xcite .",
    "generically , the admittance of birkhoff s theorem suggests the lack of spin-@xmath2 mode excitations in the linearized field equations .",
    "there are also other theories of gravity which admit exact analytic black hole solutions and further admit birkhoff s theorem . these theories , being outside the lovelock class , are generically higher derivative theories and consequently possess ghost degrees of freedom .",
    "one well known higher derivative theory is the conformal theory of gravity in four dimensions , which is obtained from an action quadratic in the conformal weyl tensor .",
    "the action is thus invariant under weyl rescalings and the field equations are traceless .",
    "birkhoff s theorem in conformal gravity states that modulo a conformal factor the most general spherically symmetric solution is static @xcite .",
    "considering the same action in dimensions other than four , one loses the property of invariance under weyl rescalings .",
    "even then , the theory admits exact analytic black hole solutions with spherical , planar or hyperbolic symmetry , and further admits birkhoff s theorem @xcite . note that , in arbitrary dimensions , though the field equations are of fourth order , the trace of the field equations are of order two .",
    "this can easily be seen as follows .",
    "varying the action gives @xmath3 now , consider infinitesimal weyl - rescalings of the metric @xmath4 . under such variations ,",
    "the lagrangian will vary as @xmath5 , which implies @xmath6 .",
    "this shows that the trace of the field equations , being proportional to the lagrangian density , must be of second order .",
    "recently , a theory of massive gravity was constructed in three dimensions @xcite , where the lagrangian is a particular combination of quadratic curvature invariants given by @xmath7 again , the theory admits exact analytic black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of this theory has a unique property in three dimensions , that the field equations have a second order trace .",
    "so , it is natural to wonder if there could be other theories of gravity which , although non - realistic , have some special properties which allows one to obtain exact analytic black hole solutions and can serve as toy models of gravitational theories . specifically , it might be useful to classify higher - derivative theories of gravity whose traced field equations have a reduced order .    in this paper",
    "we construct the most general lagrangian which is a linear combination of scalars of the form @xmath8 which are characterized by the number of derivatives of the metric ( hereafter , the degree of differentiation ) @xmath9 , such that the trace of the field equations is of order three or less .    we will show that when the trace is resticted to be of order two , then , in dimensions six or higher , there are only three linearly independent possible invariants which have a second order trace .",
    "they are the six - dimensional euler density , and the two linearly independent scalars constructed by contracting all the indices of three conformal weyl tensors . however , in five dimensions , we obtain a peculiar independent invariant which can be thought of as a cubic generalization of ( [ knmg ] ) and has been studied separately in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also obtain the general static spherically symmetric solution for some of these theories . based on our analysis for six - derivative theories ,",
    "we present a conjecture classifying all the scalars of arbitrary order , which give second order traced field equations in various dimensions .",
    "when the trace is restricted to be of order three , in arbitrary dimensions , we obtain two additional scalars .",
    "these two scalars are not independent in dimensions three and six . in six dimensions they reduce to one of the conformal anomalies .",
    "one future direction of study is to see which of these theories admit a birkhoff s theorem .    in section [ quadratic ] , for completeness",
    "we review the @xmath10 case . the case @xmath9 is analyzed in section [ cubic ] . in section [ exact solutions ] we focus our attention on obtaining the general static , spherically symmetric solution for some of the theories defined in section [ cubic ] in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "in this section , we review how to obtain the most general quadratic lagrangian , having second order traced field equations @xcite .    the most general quadratic combination of curvature invariants in arbitrary dimension is given by is @xmath11 , which is boundary term . ]",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the trace of the field equations coming from this lagrangian are@xmath15 imposing the trace @xmath16 to be of second order , implies that the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 must be chosen such that the first two terms in ( [ trqua ] ) vanish , i.e.,@xmath17   = 0 . \\label{seedqua}\\ ] ] the above equation is satisfied only if the term inside the bracket is proportional to the einstein tensor , which is the most general divergenceless , symmetric , rank two tensor linear in the curvature can not be constructed locally out of the curvature , the equation @xmath18 , with @xmath19   $ ] , does not have any non - trivial solution . ] .",
    "consequently , the coefficients in ( [ seedqua ] ) must fulfill@xmath20 since there are four variables ( @xmath21 ) and two equations , there is a bi - parametric family of solutions given by@xmath22 one can further factor out the four dimensional euler density to write ( [ lq2 ] ) in the form@xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are arbitrary constants , @xmath26 is defined by@xmath27 and @xmath28 is the gauss - bonnet combination which corresponds to the four dimensional euler density .",
    "thus , we have shown that for combinations quadratic in the curvature , the most general lagrangian which has second order traced field equation , can be expressed as a linear combination of the four dimensional euler density @xmath29 and @xmath26 defined in eq .",
    "( [ f4 ] ) .    in dimensions",
    "higher than three , one can further use the following relation@xmath30 where @xmath31 is the weyl tensor and @xmath32 is the four - dimensional conformal weyl invariant .",
    "this means that for dimensions higher than three , @xmath33 in ( [ lq2 ] ) can be equivalently expressed as a linear combination of the four - dimensional weyl invariant and the euler density .",
    "in this section , we generalize the previous discussion for lagrangians of degree of differentiation six in arbitrary dimensions @xmath34 .",
    "we start by considering a generic combination of the twelve linearly independent @xcite , curvature invariants of degree six @xmath35 where @xmath36 s are arbitrary coefficients and @xmath37 s are given by@xmath38 note however that when we neglect a total derviative the twelve terms are not linearly independent , as one can write two of the invariants in terms of the other ten in the following way@xmath39\\nonumber\\\\ l_{12 }   &   = l_{5}-l_{6}+{\\frac{1}{4}}l_{9}+\\nabla_{a}\\nabla_{c}[r_{\\ b}^{a}r^{bc}-rr^{ac}+{\\frac{1}{4}}g^{ac}r^{2}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the above relations , one can rewrite the lagrangian as a linear combination of only ten curvature invariants with coefficients @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) . extremizing the action constructed with the lagrangian ( [ lcubic ] ) with respect to the metric",
    "gives the field equations@xmath42 where @xmath43 are defined respectively in equations ( [ gab1]-[gab8 ] ) in the appendix [ eom ] .",
    "now , requiring the trace @xmath44 to be of order three , is the same as imposing trace to be proportional to @xmath45 ( see appendix [ tofe ] ) .",
    "this gives us a set of eight equations ( [ systemd ] ) for the twelve variables ( @xmath36 ) and a parameter @xmath46 ( analoguous to @xmath47 in the quadratic case ( [ constraintsquadratic ] ) ) .",
    "solving these equations for arbitrary dimensions , we obtain a five - parameter family of solutions .",
    "the details of the equations and its solution are given in the appendix [ eom ] .",
    "this implies that in @xmath48 , there are five linearly independent curvature invariants ( of degree of differentiation six ) which gives rise to third ( or lower ) order traced field equations .",
    "they are as follows .",
    "firstly , the six - dimensional euler density given by @xmath49 obviously gives second - order traced field equations .",
    "secondly , there are two independent algebraic invariants constructed out of three weyl tensors , namely @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which also gives second order traced filed equations .",
    "these two weyl invariants are given in terms of the @xmath37 s as@xmath52 and @xmath53 in addition , there are two other curvature invariants @xmath54 and @xmath55 listed in equations ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ theta ] ) respectively which give third order traced field equations .",
    "however , in dimensions @xmath56 , the above curvature invariants are not all linearly independent .",
    "for example , in @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the invariants @xmath54 and @xmath55 are proportional to each other modulo a total derivative .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in six dimensions , requiring the traced field equations to be of third order ( or less ) , we recover all the four ( @xmath59 type - a and @xmath60 type - b ) non - trivial conformal anomalies @xcite-@xcite . in table",

    "however , in @xmath63 this is not the case .",
    "in particular , there exists a special \" linearly independent invariant which generalizes @xmath26 to the cubic case .",
    "this is realized by noting that the following relation is analogous to equation ( [ keyrelation ] ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the cubic counterpart of @xmath26 .",
    "let us rewrite equation ( [ relforn6 ] ) in the form @xmath80 the term inside the parenthesis on the right hand side vanishes identically in dimensions lower than five , since for @xmath81 @xmath82 however , in @xmath63 ( and greater than @xmath83 ) this gives a non - vanishing invariant as can be seen by expressing @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath71 in terms of @xmath86 , thereby obtaining the expression ( [ definen6 ] ) .",
    "this imples that in @xmath63 , the basis is @xmath87 up to a total derivative .",

    "first , consider the following invariant of order @xmath0 @xmath96 obviously , the above invariant vanishes in dimensions lower than @xmath1 .",
    "however , if one expands the weyl tensor in terms of the riemann tensor , then it can be factorized by @xmath97 .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "consider the basis set of @xmath0-th order riemann invariants in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "in @xmath91 , not all elements of this set are linearly independent .",
    "in fact , the basis set contains one less invariant than in @xmath92 .",
    "this is because of the vanishing of the @xmath0-th order lovelock density .",
    "now , after the expanding in terms of the riemann tensors , the term ( [ termone ] ) will not contain any @xmath98 .",
    "so , this invariant can not vanish identically in @xmath91 unless it is factorized by @xmath97 . since one obtains another identity involving the riemann invariants which is obtained",

    "further expanding all the weyl tensors , one can convince one self that the dimensional dependence of the coefficient of the term with @xmath100 riemann tensors and one ricci tensor must be @xmath101 .",
    "we can now divide this factor out to get a non - vanishing invariant in @xmath91 .",
    "thus , we write the @xmath0th order generalization of @xmath26 by evaluating @xmath102 in @xmath91 . note that , by construction , the trace of the field equation arising from the above invariant is of second order in all dimensions .",
    "in this section , we present exact , static solutions for the theories defined previously . for simplicity",

    "finally for @xmath111 the geometry of @xmath112 is given by the quotient @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is a freely acting , discrete subgroup of @xmath115 .",

    "@xmath122 * * @xmath135 for dimensions other than six , the situation is different .",
    "since the theory defined by ( [ lagw1andw2 ] ) is not invariant under local weyl rescaling , one naively expects the factor @xmath136 in ( [ anzreal ] ) to be fixed by the field equations .",

    "this can be easily seen as follows : since in dimensions other than six , the trace of the field equations for the theory ( [ lagw1andw2 ] ) is proportional to the lagrangian , the invariants @xmath67 evaluated on a solution should vanish . for the spacetime under consideration ( [ anzreal ] ) , it has been shown in @xcite , that all the components of the weyl tensor are proportional to a single function @xmath139 , such that the vanishing of @xmath139 implies that the metric should be conformally flat . since the restriction @xmath140 , transforms covariantly under weyl rescalings , it does not involve the function @xmath124 , and the mentioned restriction reduces to @xmath141 , which implies @xmath142 .",
