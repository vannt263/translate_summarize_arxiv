    "with the start of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) a new energy regime is accessible , either to confirm the standard model ( sm ) or to verify new physics at the tev scale .",
    "famous possible sm extensions are heavy gauge bosons ( e.g. @xmath0 ) , supersymmetry or kaluza - klein resonances in models with extra dimensions . beside the outstanding discovery of the higgs boson , processes involving top - quarks , gauge bosons of the weak interaction and jets",
    "are of particular interest .",
    "the experimental identification will rely on their characteristic decay products with leptons or ( bottom- ) jets as characteristic examples .",
    "in addition to this sm processes , ( bottom- ) jets are also involved in many decays originating from signals for physics beyond the sm .",
    "in particular new resonances , e.g. heavy gauge bosons , decaying into @xmath1-jets or light quark jets require a detailed sm - based prediction to prove a possible deviation from the sm .",
    "this needs a detailed theoretical understanding of the corresponding processes like bottom - quark pair , single bottom - quark and di - jet production .",
    "these processes were studied in the past . the differential cross section for bottom - quark pair production",
    "is known to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "for massless single bottom production and di - jet production the nlo qcd can be found in . + it is well known that weak corrections can also be significant because of the presence of possible large sudakov logarithms .",
    "these effects were studied intensively for several processes like weak boson and top - quark pair production @xcite . earlier work on sudakov logarithms in four - fermion processes can be found in . a study for @xmath1-jet production",
    "can be found in .",
    "in the following processes with initial state photons are neglected and we distinguish between quark - induced processes ( with two quarks in the initial state , one of these being @xmath2 ) , gluon - induced contributions ( with one or two gluons in the initial state ) and in the case of @xmath1-jet production also pure bottom - quark induced processes .",
    "the lo gluon induced processes proceed through qcd amplitudes only while the four quark processes can be seperated into qcd @xmath3 , electroweak qcd @xmath4 and mixed qcd - electroweak @xmath5 contributions .",
    "sample diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkborns ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : gluonborns ] . here",
    "the light quarks ( denoted generically by @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and the bottom - quark ( @xmath1 and @xmath8 ) are taken as massless . since jets close to the beam pipe escape detection",
    ", we require a minimal transverse momentum @xmath9 of 50 gev .",
    "the leading order cross section is then obtained from @xmath10 where the factorization scale dependence is suppressed and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the partonic momentum fractions . the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) for parton @xmath13 in hadron @xmath14",
    "are denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "the sum runs over all possible parton configurations @xmath16 in the initial state .              for @xmath1-jet production three types of partonic processes",
    "will be distinguished at leading order : @xmath17 furthermore we distinguish between single @xmath1-tag and double @xmath1-tag events .",
    "the lo @xmath18-distribution for single @xmath1-tag events at the lhc is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt - bjet - lhc](a ) .",
    "the gluon - induced processes dominate in the low energy regime ( @xmath19 gev ) . for @xmath18 larger than 500 gev the quark - induced processes take over and finally dominate the distribution .",
    "this `` cross over '' of gluon- and quark - induced contributions is a consequence of the different behaviour of lhc quark and gluon luminosities .",
    "the relative contributions from the exchange of electroweak bosons and bottom - induced processes are always below @xmath20 and therefore negligible .",
    "a similiar picture is observed for the differential cross section for double @xmath1-tag events at the lhc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pt - bjet - lhc](b ) ) . here",
    "the `` cross over '' of quark- and gluon - induced contributions is around @xmath21 tev . for low @xmath18",
    "the pure bottom - induced processes are as important as quark - induced contributions .",
    "this seems surprising , because the parton luminosities of bottom - quarks in a proton should be highly suppressed compared to the light flavours .",
    "there are two reasons for the relatively large cross section of the purely bottom - induced processes .",
    "first , the partonic cross sections of @xmath22 and @xmath23 scattering are strongly enhanced for large @xmath24 values . in this region",
    "the parton processes with bottom - quarks in the initial state can be several orders of magnitude larger than the quark  antiquark - induced process .",
    "second , the bottom - quark pdf is essentially obtained by multiplying the gluon distribution in the proton with the splitting function of a gluon into a bottom - quark pair . because of the high gluon luminosities at low energies , the bottom - quark pdf becomes of the order of a few percent relative to the pdf s of the light flavours .",
    "this , together with the large partonic contributions is responsible for the relatively large bottom - induced differential cross section .",
    "the argumentation implies that the main contribution from @xmath22 , @xmath25 and @xmath23 scattering comes from the low @xmath18 region , while for high @xmath18 values these effects are small",
    ". it might be interesting to study whether the @xmath1-pdf could be further constrained using @xmath23 production at low @xmath18 . + as shown above , the leading order contributions from electroweak gauge boson exchange are always negligible for the study of @xmath1-jet production .",
    "this is also true in the context of nlo corrections with an expected size of serveral percent relative to the leading order distributions .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the qcd contributions from processes with two bottom - quarks in the initial state are unimportant for the study of @xmath18-distributions at large transverse momentum .",
    "in particular with regard to the sudakov logarithms becoming important at high energies this approximation is justified .",
    "consequently the weak @xmath26 corrections to @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 will not be taken into account . for further details",
    "we refer to .",
    "( -8.7,2.8)(a ) ( -1.25,2.8)(b )      for di - jet production the partonic final state consists of light quarks and/or gluons .",

    "the contributions of @xmath5 and @xmath4 are at the permille level for transverse momenta up to 1 tev . for higher @xmath18 values",
    "the electroweak contributions remain insignificant while the mixed qcd - electroweak contributions yield up to 5% to the differential cross section at @xmath32 2 tev . in context of",
    "the sudakov logarithms the four gluon process will not receive weak corrections within the sm at nlo accuracy .",

    "is delivered by the remaining qcd processes , which receive nlo weak corrections .",
    "+ the discussion shows that the contributions of @xmath4 are always negligible for di - jet events at the lhc .",
    "investigating the nlo @xmath36 corrections to di - jet production the @xmath5 and @xmath3 contributions can not be seperated and therefore qcd and weak corrections must be calculated .",
    "moreover it was shown , that the relative contribution of the partonic channel @xmath34 is of the order of 5 - 20% in the high energy regime , which justifies the calculation of the weak corrections .",
    "as before we subdivide the partonic channels in contributions from quark - induced and gluon - induced processes .",
    "for the calculation of the next - to - leading order weak corrections the  t hooft - feynman gauge with gauge parameters set to 1 is used .",
    "the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the massive gauge bosons @xmath37 and @xmath38 are thus represented by the goldstone fields @xmath39 and @xmath40 . since all incoming and outgoing partons are massless there are no contributions from the goldstone boson @xmath39 and the higgs boson ( also not @xmath40 for di - jet production ) .",
    "ghost fields do not contribute at the order under consideration .",
    "the virtual contributions to quark - induced processes contain infrared and ultraviolet singularities , while the gluon - induced ones are infrared finite .",
    "concerning @xmath26 corrections to qcd processes only wave function renormalisation is needed and no mass or coupling renormalisation has to performed",
    ". for the qcd corrections to @xmath5 processes the renormalisation is performed in the @xmath41 scheme .",
    "the quark - induced contributions consist of virtual and real corrections and to handle the ir singularities we use the dipole subtraction formalism by .",
    "in addition the results for @xmath1-jet production were cross - checked by implementing a phase space slicing method @xcite .",
    "the comparison between slicing and subtraction method is shown in fig .",
