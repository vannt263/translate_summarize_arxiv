    "0.5 cm in treating nuclear many - body problems , one can often reduce the  full \" many - body problem to a much smaller and more manageable problem , referred to as a model - space problem . in so doing , an important step is to determine the model - space effective interaction @xmath0 . in this paper , we would like to present an introductory and pedagogical review of this topic , especially the derivation of @xmath0 from realistic meson - exchange nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "many - body problems are difficult as we are all aware of .",
    "they are particularly so , when a , the number of particles in the system , is large .",
    "in fact a many - body problem with a=3 is already a very hard problem . in the real world , a is usually much larger .",
    "for example , a=18 when the nucleus @xmath6 is treated as an 18-nucleon problem .",
    "it becomes an a=54 problem if it is treated as composed of 54 quarks .",
    "so the complexity of the problem depends largely on how we look at the problem , or , more precisely , it depends on what is our  model space \" within which we are making our observations .",
    "let us consider the nucleus @xmath6 as an example ; it is a system of 18 nucleons .",
    "the nuclear shell model has been the most successful model for nuclear structure .",
    "this model is in fact a model - space approach .",
    "the wave functions @xmath7 of this nucleus consists of , in principle , shell - model wave functions @xmath8 , @xmath9 , .... and @xmath10 ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 denoting particles and holes with respect to a closed @xmath13 core .",
    "the dimension of this full shell - model space is practically  infinite \" . for actual calculations ,",
    "some truncation or renormalization of the full - space problem is indispensible . to describe the low - energy properties of this nucleus",
    ", it may not be necessary to consider all these wave - function components ; it may be sufficient to include just some low - energy parts of them .",
    "this is actually the approach commonly used in the shell - model description of @xmath6 , where this nucleus is treated as composed of two valence neutrons in the 0d1s shell outside a closed @xmath13 core . denoting this restricted model space as p",
    ", the hamiltonian for this nucleus is @xmath14 where @xmath0 is the effective interaction and @xmath15 denotes the single - particle ( sp ) hamiltonian .",
    ".binding energies of ca isotopes in mev given by talmi s",
    "model.@xcite [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown in the table , the @xmath17 coefficients for the @xmath18 channel are all very small . thus the counter term for the nn tensor force is nearly vanishing and consequently @xmath19 .",
    "it appears that the tensor force is exempted from renormalization .",
    "it should be of interest to further study this possible exemption property of the tensor force .",

    "hermitian low - momentum interactions * 0.3 cm it should be pointed out that the low - momentum nn interaction given by the above folded - diagram expansion is not hermitian .",
    "this is not a desirable feature , and one would like to have an interaction which is hermitian .",
    "methods for deriving hermitian effective interactions have been developed by okubo @xcite and andreozzi @xcite . a general framework for constructing hermitian effective interactions",
    "was recently studied by holt , kuo and brown @xcite . in this section",
    ", we shall discuss their method for derivation of hermitian effective interactions . as we shall see shortly , one can in fact construct a family of hermitian low - momentum nn interactions that are phase - shift equivalent .",
    "let us denote the folded - diagram low - momentum nn interaction as @xmath20 .",
    "( recall that we have used the lee - suzuki ( ls ) method for its derivation . ) @xmath20 preserves the half - on - shell @xmath3-matrix @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "if we relax this half - on - shell constraint , we can obtain low - momentum nn interactions which are hermitian .",
    "( note the hermitian potentials discussed below all preserve the fully on - shell @xmath3-matrix and are phase - shift equivalent @xcite . )    the model - space secular equation for @xmath20 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a subset of the eigenvalues @xmath25 of the full - space schroedinger equation @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the @xmath28-space projection of the full - space wave function @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 .",
    "the above effective interaction may be rewritten in terms of a wave operator @xmath31 , namely @xmath32 where @xmath31 possesses the usual properties : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the complement of @xmath28 , @xmath35 .",
    "while the full - space eigenvectors @xmath7 are orthogonal to each other , the model - space eigenvectors @xmath27 are clearly not so and consequently the effective interaction @xmath20 is not hermitian .",
    "we now make a @xmath36 transformation such that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the dimension of the model space .",
    "this transformation reorients the vectors @xmath39 such that they become orthonormal to each other .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 s ( @xmath40 ) are linearly independent so that @xmath41 exists , otherwise the above transformation is not possible . since @xmath42 and @xmath36 exist entirely within the model space , we can write @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    using eq .  ( 52 ) , we transform eq .",
    "( 50 ) into @xmath45 which implies @xmath46 since @xmath47 is real ( it is an eigenvalue of @xmath48 which is hermitian ) and the vectors @xmath42 are orthonormal to each other , @xmath49 is clearly hermitian . the non - hermitian secular equation , eq .",
    "( 12 ) , is now transformed into a hermitian model - space eigenvalue problem @xmath50 with the hermitian effective interaction @xmath51 or equivalently @xmath52    to calculate @xmath53 , we must first have the @xmath36 transformation .",
    "since there are certainly many ways to construct @xmath36 , this generates a family of hermitian effective interactions , all originating from @xmath20 . for example",
    ", we can construct @xmath36 using the familiar schmidt orthogonalization procedure , namely : @xmath54 with the matrix elements @xmath55 determined from eq .",
    "we denote the hermitian effective interaction using this @xmath36 transformation as @xmath56 . clearly there is more than one such schmidt procedure .",
    "for instance , we can use @xmath57 as the starting point , which gives @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and so forth .",
    "this freedom in choosing the orthogonalization procedure actually gives us many ways to generate a hermitian interaction , and this is our family of hermitian interactions produced from @xmath20 .",
    "we now show how some well - known hermitization transformations relate to ( and in fact , are special cases of ) ours .",
    "we first look at the okubo transformation @xcite . from the properties of the wave operator @xmath31",
    "@xmath60 it follows that an analytic choice for the @xmath36 transformation is @xmath61 this leads to the hermitian effective interaction & & v_okb-1= p ( 1+^+ ) ^1/2p(h_0+v_ls)p ( 1+^+ ) ^-1/2p + & & 0.8 cm -ph_0p .",
    "it is easily seen that the above is equal to the okubo hermitian effective interaction & & v_okb = p ( 1+^+ ) ^-1/2(1+^+)(h_0+v ) + & & ( 1 + ) ( 1+^+ ) ^-1/2p - ph_0p , giving us an alternative expression , eq .",
    "( 62 ) , for the okubo interaction .",
    "there is another interesting choice for the transformation @xmath36 .",
    "as pointed out by andreozzi @xcite , the positive definite operator @xmath62 can be decomposed into two cholesky matrices , namely @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a lower triangle cholesky matrix , @xmath65 being its transpose . since @xmath64 is real and it is within the @xmath28-space , we have @xmath66 and the corresponding hermitian effective interaction from eq .  ( 56 ) is @xmath67 this is the hermitian effective interaction of andreozzi @xcite .",
    "the hermitian effective interaction of suzuki and okamoto @xcite is of the form @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it has been shown that this interaction is the same as the okubo interaction @xcite . in terms of the @xmath36 transformation",
    ", it is readily seen that the operator @xmath71 is equal to @xmath72 with @xmath36 given by eq .",
    "thus , these three well - known hermitian effective interactions indeed belong to our family .",
    "the family of hermitian potentials are all phase - shift equivalent to @xmath20 @xcite .    using a solvable matrix model",
    ", one finds that the above hermitian effective interactions @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be quite different @xcite from each other and from @xmath20 , especially when @xmath20 is largely non - hermitian . for the @xmath1 case , it is fortunate that the @xmath2 coresponding to @xmath20 is only slightly non - hermitian . as a result , the hermitian low - momentum nn inteactions corresponding to @xmath73 and @xmath74 are all quite similar to each other and to @xmath20 .",
    "thus in applications it is the @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath20 which is commonly used @xcite .",
    "as indicated by figs .  6 - 8 , the @xmath2 interactions derived from free - space @xmath1 have worked well in shell - model calculations involving mainly valence nucleons .",
    "but for infinite symmetric nuclear matter , such free - space two - nucleon interactions alone are unable to reproduce simultaneously the empirical saturation energy and density ( @xmath75mev and @xmath76@xmath77 ) @xcite . to illustrate , we display in fig .",
    "15 results from a recent nuclear matter calculation @xcite using a non - pertubative ring - diagram resummation method that will be outlined later . there the lowest curve ( c ) is obtained with the free - space bonns potential @xcite .",
    "as seen this curve descends rapidly with density , showing no sign of reaching a local minimum at the saturation energy and density . in the present section",
    "we outline how this over - binding problem may be overcome by using density - dependent effective interactions generated by the brown - rho scaling mechanism @xcite or the inclusion of three - nucleon potential @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "( the symbol @xmath1 will be used to denote the two - nucleon potential . )",
    "realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials are mediated by the exchange of mesons such as the @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath31 and @xmath80 mesons . in constructing these potentials the meson - nucleon coupling constants ( and in some cases their masses )",
    "are adjusted to fit the ` free - space ' nn scattering data .",
    "mesons in a nuclear medium , however , can have properties ( masses and couplings ) that are different from those in free space , as the former are ` dressed ' or ` renormalized ' by their interactions with the medium .",
    "thus , the nn potential in a medium of density @xmath81 , usually denoted by @xmath82 , should be different from that in free space .",
    "the well - known brown - rho ( br ) scaling mechanism @xcite provides a schematic framework for deriving such density - dependent interactions .",
    "a main result is the universal scaling relation for nucleon and meson masses : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote respectively the in - medium and in - vacuum masses , and the parameter @xmath17 has the value @xmath86 .",
    "this scaling naturally renders @xmath1 a density - dependent interaction @xmath82 . as we shall describe later",
    ", it is remarkable that the above simple scaling law , derived in the context of chiral symmetry restoration in dense matter , would have important consequences for traditional nuclear structure physics .",
    "we have carried out several studies on the effects of br scaling on finite nuclei , nuclear matter and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "let us just briefly describe a few of them . for convenience in implementing br scaling , we have employed the bonna and/or bonns one - boson - exchange potentials @xcite whose parameters for @xmath79 , @xmath31 and @xmath80 mesons are scaled with the density ( in our calculations the meson masses and cut - off parameters are equally scaled ) .",
    "note that @xmath78 is protected by chiral symmetry and is not scaled .",
    "that we scale @xmath79 but not @xmath78 has an important consequence for the tensor force , which plays an important role in the famous gamow - teller ( gt ) matrix element for the @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89-decay @xcite . the tensor force from @xmath78- and @xmath79-meson exchange",
    "are of opposite signs . a lowering of only @xmath90 , but not @xmath91 , can significantly suppress the net tensor force strength and thus largely diminish the gt matrix element .",
    "in addition , the scaling of the @xmath31 meson introduces additional short - distance repulsion into the nucleon - nucleon interaction , which was found to also contribute to the suppression @xcite .",
    "with br - scaling we were able to satisfactorily account for the anomalously - long @xmath92-yr lifetime of this decay @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the br scaling as given in eq .",
    "( 65 ) is a linear scaling , and it may be suitable for low densities near @xmath93 only ( @xmath94 of eq .",
    "( 67 ) may become negative for large @xmath81 ) . for high densities ,",
    "we need a different scaling such as the new - br scaling @xcite . before describing this scaling ,",
    "let us first describe briefly a @xmath2 ring - diagram formalism @xcite on which our nuclear - matter calculations with the new - br scaling are based .    in this ring - diagram formalism @xcite",
    "the nuclear - matter ground - state energy is given by the all - order sum of the particle - particle hole - hole ( @xmath95 ) ring diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "the ground - state energy of asymmetric nuclear matter is expressed as @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the energy for the non - interacting system and @xmath98 is the energy shift due to the nn interaction .",
    "we include in general three types of ring diagrams , the proton - proton , neutron - neutron and proton - neutron ones .",
    "the proton and neutron fermi momenta are , respectively , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 denote respectively the proton and neutron density .",
    "the isospin asymmetry parameter is @xmath103 . with such ring diagrams summed to all orders , we have [ eng ] e(n,)&=&_0 ^ 1 d_m _",
    "ijkl < y_m(ij , ) y_m^*(kl , ) + & & ij|v_low - k|kl , where @xmath104 is a strength parameter , integrated from 0 to 1 . the transition amplitudes @xmath105 are obtained from a @xmath95 rpa equation @xcite .",
    "these @xmath105 amplitudes represent & & y_m(,)=_0|a_^ a_^|_m , + & &  ( , ) = ( h , h )  or  ( p , p ) , where @xmath106 and @xmath29 are respectively the ground state and @xmath85th excited state of nuclear matter with two additional particles or holes .",
    "@xmath107 is a measure of the particle - particle excitations in the ground state .",
    "setting @xmath107=0 means the ground state is taken to be the closed fermi sea , and the above ring - diagram method reduces to the usual hf method where only the first - order ring diagram ( diagram ( a ) of fig .",
    "3 ) is included for the energy shift . in this case , the above energy shift becomes @xmath108 where @xmath109=(1,0 ) if @xmath110 for protons and @xmath109=(1,0 ) if @xmath111 for neutrons .",
    "the above @xmath2 ring - diagram framework has been applied to symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite and to the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "this framework has also been tested by applying it to dilute cold neutron matter in the limit that the @xmath112 scattering length of the underlying interaction approaches infinity @xcite .",
    "this limit  which is a conformal fixed point  is usually referred to as the unitary limit . for many - body systems at this limit , the ratio @xmath113 is expected to be a universal constant of value @xmath114 .",
    "( @xmath115 and @xmath116 are , respectively , the interacting and non - interacting ground - state energies of the many - body system . )",
    "the above ring - diagram method has been used to calculate neutron matter using several very different unitarity potentials ( a unitarity cdbonn potential obtained by tuning its meson parameters , and several square - well unitarity potentials ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath117 ratios given by our calculations for all these different unitarity potentials are all close to 0.44 , in good agreement with the quantum - monte - carlo results ( see @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "in fact our ring - diagram results for @xmath117 are significantly better than those given by hf and bhf ( brueckner hf ) @xcite .",
    "the above unitary calculations have provided satisfactory results , supporting the reliability of our @xmath2 ring - diagram framework for calculating the nuclear matter eos .",
    "we now describe the new - br scaling @xcite on which the results shown in fig .  15 are based .",
    "the idea behind this scaling is that when a large number of skyrmions as baryons are put on an fcc ( face - centered - cubic ) crystal to simulate dense matter , the skyrmion matter undergoes a transition to a matter consisting of half - skyrmions @xcite in bcc ( body - centered - cubic ) configuration at a density that we shall denote as @xmath118 .",
    "this density is difficult to pin down precisely but it is more or less independent of the mass of the dilaton scalar , the only low - energy degree of freedom that is not well - known in free space .",
    "the density at which this occurs has been estimated to lie typically between 1.3 and 2 times normal nuclear matter density @xmath93  @xcite . in our model",
    ", nuclear matter is separated into two regions i and ii respectively for densities @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "as inferred by our model , they have different scaling functions @xmath121 it has been found that both the br and new - br scalings are important for nuclear - matter saturation @xcite .",
    "the eos shown by ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "15 are obtained with the new - br scaling with @xmath122 and 2.0@xmath93 respectively .",
    "both give an energy per nucleon @xmath123 mev , saturation density @xmath124 and compression modulus @xmath125=208 mev , all in satisfactory agreement with the empirical values @xcite .",
    "we believe that this scaling works well for low densities of @xmath126 .    as described in @xcite , we employ in our new - br scaling calculations the bonns potential @xcite with scaling parameters @xmath127=0.13 , @xmath128=0.121 , @xmath129=0.139 , @xmath130=0.13 and @xmath131=0 for region i , where @xmath132 is the associated scaling of the meson - nucleon coupling constant . for region",
    "ii the scaling parameters are @xmath127=0.13 , @xmath128=0.121 , @xmath129=0.139 , @xmath133=0.13 , @xmath134=0 and @xmath135=0.77 for ( a ) and 0.78 for ( b ) .",
    "note that this scaling has some special features : in region i the coupling constants @xmath136 and @xmath137 are not scaled , while in region ii only the coupling constant @xmath136 is scaled . also in region ii the nucleon mass is a density - independent constant as given earlier .",
    "note that our choices for the @xmath17 parameters are consistent with the ericson scaling which is based on a scaling relation for the quark condensate @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "according to this scaling , at low densities one should have @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",

    "16 where the calculated @xmath141 for neutron matter ( upper panel ) and symmetric nuclear matter ( lower panel ) are compared with the danielewicz constraints @xcite . for neutron matter , there are two constraints , one for stiff eos ( upper box ) and the other for soft eos ( lower box ) .",

    ", how to scale the hadrons with the medium is an interesting question and should be further studied .",

    "the resulting eos for symmetric nuclear matter is presented in fig .",
    "19 ( lower panel ) , denoted by ` @xmath197 ' .",
    "this eos has ground - state energy per nucleon @xmath198 mev , compression modulus @xmath199 mev and saturation density @xmath200 , all in satisfactory agreement with the empirical values .",
    "our eos calculated with @xmath196 has worked well in the low - density region near @xmath93 . in this region , this eos and the new - br one shown in the upper panel of the figure agree well with each other , indicating that the new - br - scaled @xmath1 and the combined potential @xmath201 can both describe nuclear matter at low density near @xmath93 satisfactorily .",
    "but for densities beyond @xmath202 , the eos given by these two potentials have significant differences as shown by fig .",
    "19 . in the lower panel of fig .  19",
    ", we also present the eos given by the combined potential ( @xmath203 ) where @xmath149 is the same skyrme - type density - dependent interaction used in the upper panel of the figure .",
    "the same ring - diagram method is used for both eos . as seen , this eos and the one from ( @xmath204 ) are in good agreement for densities lower than @xmath205 , indicating that for such low densities the effect of @xmath5 can be well reproduced by @xmath149 .",
    "but at higher densities , the @xmath149 eos is significantly lower . to have better agreement between the two",
    ", we may need to use a @xmath149 with different @xmath152 and @xmath153 parameters .",
    "this possibility is being studied by us and some recent work in this direction can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "medium modifications to the nucleon - nucleon interaction resulting from brown - rho scaling or three - nucleon forces have also succeeded in explaining the very long lifetime ( @xmath92yrs ) of the @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89-decay .",
    "the expected lifetime is only several hours , and in order to achieve the empirical lifetime a precise cancellation in the gamow - teller matrix element to the order of one part in a thousand is required .",
    "calculations using @xmath1 ( unscaled ) find only a small suppression @xcite of the transition , and it is only with the inclusion of medium modifications that it has been possible to explain the long lifetime @xcite .",
    "based on the above @xmath201 eos we have also calculated the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath143 using a method as described in ref .",
    "lattimer and lim @xcite have studied the constraints on @xmath143 and @xmath64 ( defined as @xmath206 ) . at density @xmath207",
    "their constraints are @xmath208 and @xmath209 . at @xmath207 ,",
    "our results are @xmath210 mev and @xmath211 mev , both in good agreement with the lattimer - lim constraints . at densities",
    "higher than @xmath202 , our calculated @xmath143 exhibits , however , a supersoft behavior ( namely it decreases with density after reaching a maximum near @xmath212 ) . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , predictions of @xmath143 at high densities are rather diverse , depending on the nucleon - nucleon interactions employed . further studies of @xmath143 at densities beyond @xmath202 are certainly needed and of interest .",
    "as illustrated by the pioneering work of talmi @xcite , nuclear shell - model calculations in small model spaces can describe empirical nuclear properties highly successfully .",
    "an important ingredient in such calculations is the use of empirically determined effective interactions .",
    "it is of interest to see if such interactions can be derived microscopically from an underlying nn interaction and how .",
    "this question has been widely studied in past years . in this paper",
    "several developments related to this question have been discussed .",
    "first we reviewed the @xmath213-box folded - diagram theory , with which the full - space nuclear hamiltonian can be reduced to a model - space effective one of the form @xmath214 . here",
    "@xmath215 is the sp hamiltonian extracted from experimental sp energies , and the effective interaction is given by a folded - diagram expansion in terms of the irreducible vertex function @xmath213-box .",
    "methods for summing up this series for both degenerate and non - degenerate model spaces are discussed . to calculate @xmath0 , a first step is to calculate the @xmath213-box , which is composed of irreducible valence - linked diagrams , from the input nn interactions .    we have reviewed the low - momentum interaction @xmath2 which has been commonly used in the @xmath0 calculations .",
    "this interaction has been obtained from realistic @xmath1 by integrating out their high - momentum components beyond a decimation scale @xmath177 using a renormalization - group procedure .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 interaction is a smooth potential ( without strong repulsive core ) which is convenient for calculations .",
    "furthermore such interactions derived from different @xmath1 models are nearly the same , for @xmath177 less than @xmath216 , leading to a nearly unique low - momentum interaction .",
    "as indicated by the few sample calculations presented earlier , shell - model calculations using the effective interaction derived from @xmath2 have indeed worked rather successfully in describing low - energy experimental data .",
    "turning to nuclear systems at densities near and above @xmath93 , a long standing problem has been that calculations with the two - nucleon potential @xmath1 alone are unable to give satisfactory saturation properties .",
    "we have demonstrated that this shortcoming can be amended by including either the new - br scaling or @xmath196 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "19 , the eos from new - br ( @xmath217 ) and ( @xmath197 ) are close to each other for densities below @xmath205 .",
    "both can reproduce the empirical nuclear saturation properties well . in our eos calculations",
    "we have employed a ring - diagram method where the particle - particle hole - hole ring diagrams are summed to all orders .",
    "the symmetry energy at densities near @xmath93 can also be well reproduced by the above two approaches .",
    "there may be some underlying equivalence between new - br scaling and @xmath5 at low densities , and its further study will be interesting as well as useful .",
    "a similar equivalence is observed concerning the famous gamow - teller ( gt ) matrix element for the @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89-decay , which has an anomalously long half - life of @xmath218yrs .",
    "the use of the br - scaled @xmath1 has been crucial in highlighting the important role played by medium effects not normally included in many - body perturbation theory calculations with free - space two - body interactions .",
    "these medium effects can be recast in the language of three - body forces , which have been equally successful in describing the transition .",
    "but at densities higher than @xmath202 , the nuclear - matter eos given by these two approaches are significantly different , as indicated by fig .  19 . at such high densities ,",
    "the symmetry energies given by them are also very different .",
    "studies of these differences and their impact on neutron star properties , such as the mass - radius relationship and maximum mass , will be of interest .",
    "we have compared the new - br and @xmath5 eoss with the eos given by ( unscaled-@xmath1 + @xmath149 ) .",
    "it is observed that all three are in good qualitative agreement in the density region below @xmath205 . that the density - dependent effects on symmetric nuclear matter near @xmath93 from the new - br scaling and from @xmath5 may be well reproduced by an empirical density - dependent force of the skyrme type is an interesting result , indicating that the empirical skyrme force may have a microscopic connection with the new - br scaling and/or @xmath5",
