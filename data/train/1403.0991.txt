    "there are three different regimes of interest , depending on the behavior of @xmath11 near the origin and at infinity  local dissipation , fractional dissipation and nonlocal alignment .",
    "here is a brief overview .",

    "system belongs to the class of compressible navier - stokes equations with degenerate viscosity @xmath21 which vanishes at the vacuum .",
    "the study of such equations is mostly limited to one dimension . for existence and uniqueness of weak solution with `` moderate degeneracy '' , @xmath22 , we refer to @xcite .",
    "mellet and vasseur @xcite proved that the degenerate viscosity is nevertheless strong enough to enforce global existence and uniqueness of the strong solution away from vacuum assuming @xmath23 .",
    ". fractional dissipation .",
    "_ consider an influence function with a sufficiently strong singularity at the origin , @xmath24 , associated with fractional dissipation of order @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding incompressible setup ( setting , formally , @xmath26 in ) reads @xmath27 @xmath28-energy bound implies that global smooth solutions exist for @xmath29 , e.g. @xcite .",
    "additional pointwise bounds available in the one - dimensional case , imply that burgers equation with fractional dissipation , @xmath30 , admits global solutions for @xmath31 ; the critical case , @xmath32 was the subject of extensive recent studies @xcite    _ # 3 .",
    "nonlocal alignment .",
    "_ in this paper we focus our attention on the remaining case where @xmath11 is bounded at the origin and decays sufficiently slow at infinity . as a prototypical example we may consider @xmath33 with @xmath34 : the nonlocal alignment ( due to the divergent tail of @xmath35 ) enforces an unconditional flocking of both the cs and mt models ( [ eq : first]),([eqs : mod ] ) , consult @xcite .    the main system we are concerned with in this paper is the corresponding `` pressure - less '' compressible euler equations with nonlocal alignment    [ eq : main ] @xmath36 subject to compactly supported initial density @xmath37 and uniformly bounded initial velocity @xmath38 , @xmath39    the scaling function @xmath40 corresponds to the cs and mt models , @xmath41    throughout the paper , the influence function , @xmath11 , is assumed non - increasing , lipschitz and non - local in the sense of having a divergent tail @xmath42 without loss of generality , we assume @xmath43 .    our first main result , stated in theorem [ thm : flock ] below shows , in analogy with the agent - based models , that lipschitz solutions of driven by nonlocal alignment are self - organized into a macroscopic flock .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask , when does the system ( [ eq : main ] ) preserve the lipschitz regularity of @xmath44 for all time ?",
    "this question regarding the uniform global bound @xmath45 occupies the rest of the paper .",
    "we begin with the one - dimensional case .",
    "our second main result , summarized in corollary [ thm : global ] , shows that there exists a large set of so - called _ sub - critical initial configurations _ , under which @xmath46 remains bounded for all time . on the other hand",
    ", there exists a set of super - critical initial configurations which leads to the lose of regularity at finite time , @xmath47 as @xmath48 . the so called _ critical threshold _",
    "phenomenon for eulerian dynamics was first systematically studied in @xcite in euler - poisson equations , followed by a series of related studies @xcite .",
    "in particular , liu and tadmor @xcite studied the critical threshold phenomenon of the one - dimensional burgers equation with nonlocal convolution source term , @xmath49 , corresponding to the one - dimensional cs alignment system with @xmath50 . here , we extend this result , proving critical threshold phenomenon for the non - vacuum density - dependent model ( theorem [ thm:1dnf ] ) .",
    "thus , global regularity and hence flocking follow for sub - critical data , which in turn enables us to significantly improve the critical threshold derived in @xcite .",
    "next , we extend the global regularity and hence flocking result of cs hydrodynamics to two - space dimension ( theorem [ thm:2dcs ] ) .",
    "these global regularity results are complemented by the unique feature of the non - local alignment , which prevents finite - time blow - up dynamics within regions of vacuum ( theorem [ thm : vacuum ] ) .",
    "finally , the flocking of one- and two - dimensional mt hydrodynamics is summarized in theorem [ thm : mainmt ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we state the main results in section [ sec : results ] . in section",
    "[ sec : flock ] , we prove that global strong solution implies flocking . in section [ sec : nonvacuum ] , we prove critical thresholds for cucker - smale system , in dimension one and two .",

    "vacuum ] , we discuss the boundedness of @xmath51 inside the vacuum .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : mt ] , where we extend these results to the motsch - tadmor system .",
    "we begin with the notion of flocking , e.g. @xcite .    [",

    "the following theorem shows flocking property for _ strong _ ( lipschitz ) solutions of the non - local alignment system .",
    "in fact the following fast alignment holds for strong solutions of both cs and mt models .",
    "this is quantified in terms of the following interaction bound , which will be used throughout the paper , @xmath58 recalling that @xmath59 one may use the cs interaction bound @xmath60 , whereas @xmath61 for the mt model .",

    "it is an extension of the result in @xcite for the case where @xmath50 .",
    "taking advantage of the fast alignment property , we are able to improve the result to the lighter area .    the last theorem is restricted to the non - vacuum portion of the solution . for local systems , e.g. ,",
    "the dynamics inside the vacuum acts the same way as the inviscid burgers equation , with generic formation of shock discontinuities .",
    "it is here that we take advantage of the non - local character of the alignment model ( [ eq : main ] ) : our next theorem identifies an upper threshold which ensures that @xmath72 remains bounded even outside the support of @xmath89 .",
