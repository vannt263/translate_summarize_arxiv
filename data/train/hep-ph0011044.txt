    "mass predictions for scalar  @xmath0 glueballs extracted from qcd sum - rules have been problematic mainly due to discrepancies between analyses which are sensitive to the low - energy theorem for gluonic correlation functions and those which are insensitive to this quantity  @xcite .",
    "such a discrepancy would be indicative of two widely - separated states , a result which has already been seen to occur in explicit two - resonance analyses of laplace sum - rules even in the absence of mixing with quark scalar resonances @xcite .",
    "however , there exists substantial evidence that these discrepancies are resolved by the inclusion of instanton  @xcite effects in the laplace sum - rules for scalar glueballs  @xcite .",
    "recently , techniques for using gaussian sum - rules  @xcite to predict hadronic properties have been developed  @xcite .",
    "in particular , these methods concentrate on normalized gaussian sum - rules which are independent of the finite - energy sum - rule constraint which is central to the original heat - evolution studies @xcite of the gaussian sum - rules",
    ". advantages of this approach compared with laplace sum - rules include enhanced sensitivity to the hadronic spectral function over a wide range of energy . in this paper ,",
    "these techniques are employed and generalized in an effort to obtain resonance parameter predictions for scalar gluonium .",
    "furthermore , the formulation of these sum - rules is extended to include gaussian kernels weighted by integer powers , @xmath1 } \\frac{1}{\\pi } \\rho(t ) { \\ensuremath { \\mathrm{d}t } }    \\quad,\\quad k\\geq -1\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a hadronic spectral function with physical threshold @xmath3 .",
    "similar to the laplace sum - rules , the low - energy theorem ( let )  @xcite ( see  ( [ let ] ) below ) for scalar gluonic currents enters _ only _ the @xmath4 gaussian sum - rule , and instanton contributions to the correlation function serve to mitigate the discrepancy between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 sum - rules . however , theoretical uncertainties associated with the instanton and let parameters are shown to be overwhelming in the @xmath4 sum - rule , rendering it unsuitable for phenomenological analysis .",
    "thus the @xmath6 gaussian sum - rule is the focus of our detailed predictions for scalar glueballs , including an estimate of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we show that the gaussian sum - rules of scalar gluonic currents contain signatures that the hadronic spectral function is distributed over a broad energy range , ( 0.81.6 ) gev including qcd uncertainties , and that this distribution most likely consists of two separate resonances . since these sum - rules probe the gluonic content of hadronic states , they are sensitive to the glueball component of the observed scalar mesons which in general could be glueball - quark meson mixtures .",

    "the results of this analysis are summarized in table  [ moms_summary_table ] .",
    "the deviation of the phenomenological predictions from the values computed using qcd was typically 2050% , with the best agreement occurring in the skewed gaussian resonance model . while certainly not perfect , this represented a vast improvement over analogous calculations performed in the various single non - zero width resonance models ( see table  [ width_tab ] ) .",

    "therefore , in addition to our previous conclusion concerning the necessity for distributed resonance strength , we note further that a single non - zero width resonance model is insufficient to account for this spreading and that far better consistency between theory and phenomenology ( as encapsulated in the gaussian sum - rules of scalar gluonium ) is achieved by employing models which allow for a second resonance .    although certainly relevant to the nature of the spectrum of scalar states with masses under 2 gev , it is difficult to make a direct comparison between our results and the entries of the pdg  @xcite since the typical mass separation between the various observed scalar states is relatively small : on the order of 0.2 gev .",
