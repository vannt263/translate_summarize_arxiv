    "the interaction between light and matter , and more generally between harmonic oscillators and few - level quantum systems , is ubiquitous in nature . in spite of the simplicity in its basic mathematical description , it results in a wide variety of phenomena ,",
    "some of which have been analyzed in detail over the past few decades @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting phenomena involving light - matter interaction is superradiance .",
    "the study of this phenomenon started with the idea that an ensemble containing a large number of atoms can exhibit quantum - coherent collective behaviour in its absorption and emission of photons @xcite .",
    "this observation gave rise to the dicke model , where a large number of atoms interact with a single ( harmonic - oscillator ) mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "it was later realized that the dicke model exhibits a phase transition , both thermal and quantum , between a state with negligible light - matter correlations and one with strong correlations @xcite . in the case of the quantum phase transition",
    ", the correlations appear when the coupling strength between the two subsystems exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "the prediction of the superradiance phase transition in the dicke model has resulted in enormous interest , including a debate that continues to this day @xcite on whether such a phase transition could occur for a system with the usual electric coupling between light and matter .",
    "studies on the superradiance phase transition in the dicke model typically consider the thermodynamic limit , where the number of atoms approaches infinity with the effective coupling strength between the collective atomic mode and the electromagnetic mode kept independent of atom number .",
    "this approach to realizing the phase transition is naturally motivated by the fact that the interaction between natural atoms and optical - frequency cavities is weak compared to the bare atomic and cavity frequencies .",
    "recently , the realization of qubit - oscillator systems using superconducting qubit circuits has made it possible to achieve the so - called ultrastrong - coupling regime , where the coupling strength between a single qubit and a single oscillator is comparable to the bare frequencies of the two constituents @xcite .",
    "this ability relaxes the requirement of using large atomic ensembles in order to study strong - coupling effects ; a single ( artificial ) atom suffices .",
    "since the artificial atom in these studies is effectively a two - level system , we shall sometimes refer to it as the qubit .",
    "it has been noted in a number of recent studies that the single - qubit  single - oscillator problem exhibits similar phase - transition - like behaviour in the limit where the ratio of the resonator frequency to the qubit frequency tends to zero @xcite .",
    "here we examine this limit closely and analyze the associated transition .",
    "we do so by analyzing the behaviour of several physical quantities in the transition region .",
    "these include the energy - level structure , the average value of the field in the cavity , the squeezing in the oscillator and the qubit - oscillator entanglement .",
    "it should be emphasized that the limit considered here is clearly distinct from the thermodynamic limit with a large number of qubits .",
    "we shall therefore not use the term  phase transition \" in this paper .",
    "it is quite interesting that several ground - state properties exhibit essentially the same behaviour in the two distinct limits .",
    "the correspondence between the two limits is not complete , however , as evidenced by the fact that no thermal phase transition occurs in the simple system considered here ( see sec .",
    "the system that we consider here is composed of a single qubit coupled to a single harmonic oscillator .",
    "the coupling contains only one term , and this term is linear in the oscillator variables .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this quantum system is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the usual pauli matrices ( with @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the creation and annihilation operators of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the so - called gap and bias of the qubit , @xmath9 is the oscillator s characteristic frequency , and @xmath10 is the qubit - oscillator coupling strength .    for purposes of the present study , we focus on the case with the qubit biased at its symmetry point ( @xmath11 ) , where the hamiltonian can simply be expressed as @xmath12 it should also be noted that in writing this hamiltonian [ and also in eq .",
    "( [ eq : detailed_hamiltonians ] ) ] we ignore the so - called @xmath13 term that is at the heart of the superradiance - phase - transition controversy @xcite .    in the absence of coupling , i.e.  when @xmath14 , the ground state of the system is given by @xmath15 for very strong coupling , the quantitative definition of which will become clear below , the ground state is highly correlated and ( to a good approximation ) given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 are coherent states with opposite values of the oscillator variable that couples to the qubit , i.e.  the field operator @xmath18 .",
    "using the results from the thermodynamic limit , i.e.  the limit where the number of atoms is large , the critical coupling strength separating the uncorrelated and correlated ground states is expected to occur at the point @xmath19 we shall show through the behaviour of various quantities that similar behaviour is obtained in the single - atom case in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "it should be emphasized that , even though one might worry about the possibility that @xmath21 might vanish or diverge in this limit , this apparent complication disappears if one treats @xmath21 as a reference point for measuring the coupling strength .",
    "if one then considers the behaviour of the system as the parameter @xmath22 is varied across the point @xmath23 , no complications related to the behaviour of @xmath21 arise .     as a function of the oscillator frequency @xmath24 and the coupling strength @xmath10 , both measured in comparison to the qubit frequency @xmath7 .",

    "let us now consider the case with a finite number @xmath49 of qubits @xcite . in this model , the qubits",
    "are usually assumed to have the same single - qubit energies @xmath7 and the same coupling strength to the oscillator , which is usually defined as @xmath59 .",
    "the hamiltonian in this case is given by @xmath60 where we have defined the total spin operators @xmath61 . in the limit @xmath20 ,",
    "all the results concerning the low - energy spectrum of the resonator remain unchanged ; one could say that the reduction of the coupling strength by the factor @xmath62 is compensated by the strengthening of the spin raising and lowering operators by the same factor because of the collective behaviour of the qubits . in particular",
    ", the transition occurs at the critical coupling strength given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : criticalcouplingstrength ] ) .",
    "because the qubits now have a larger total spin ( when compared to the single - qubit case ) , spin states that are separated by small angles can be drastically different ( i.e.  have a small overlap ) .",
    "in particular , the overlap for @xmath49 qubits is given by @xmath63 . by expanding this function to second order around @xmath64",
    ", one can see that for small values of @xmath65 the relevant overlap is lower than unity by an amount that is proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "this dependence translates into the dependence of the qubit - oscillator entanglement on the coupling strength just above the critical point .",
    "the entanglement therefore rises more sharply in the multi - qubit case ( with the increase being by a factor @xmath49 ) , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropyloglog ] .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ground_state_infinite_coupling ] ) gives the ground state deep in the superradiance region .",
    "the first - excited state has the same form , but with a minus sign instead of the plus sign .",
    "the energy separation between these two states decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath10 . as a result",
    ", an infinitesimally small temperature would be sufficient to destroy the coherence between the two branches of the wave function in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation function @xmath33 exhibits essentially the same behaviour for the two states .",
    "furthermore , all low - lying energy levels have a qualitatively similar correlation between the state of the qubit and the field in the oscillator ( even though the entanglement might be lost ) .",
    "one can therefore ask whether a finite - temperature phase transition would still occur between a region of correlated qubit - oscillator states and a region with no correlation .    the energy level structure in the single - qubit case is simple in principle . in the limit @xmath20",
    ", one can say that the energy levels form two sets , one corresponding to each qubit state .",
    "each one of these sets has a structure that is similar to that of a harmonic oscillator with some modifications that are not central in the present context .",
    "in particular the density of states has a weak dependence on energy , a situation that can not support a thermal phase transition .",
    "if the temperature is increased while all other system parameters are kept fixed , qubit - oscillator correlations ( which are finite only above the critical point ) gradually decrease and vanish asymptotically in the high - temperature limit .",
    "no singular point is encountered along the way .",
    "this result implies that the transition point is independent of temperature . in other words , it remains at the value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : criticalcouplingstrength ] ) for all temperatures .",
    "if , for example , one is investigating the dependence of the correlation function @xmath33 on the coupling strength ( as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinfieldsigncorrelationfunction ] ) , the only change that occurs as we increase the temperature is that the qubit - oscillator correlations change more slowly when the coupling strength is varied .",
    "as we have mentioned above , the singular transition in the limit @xmath20 is distinct from that encountered in the thermodynamic limit @xmath66 . given the similarities between the two transitions , one can ask whether it is possible to identify a single , unified condition for the realization of singular behaviour . for example , one candidate for this unified condition could be @xmath67 .",
    "if such a unified condition existed , we would expect that for any large value of @xmath49 there is a proportionately large value of @xmath26 above which the sharp transition is replaced by a smooth crossover .",
    "however , the presence of a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit is independent of the ratio @xmath26 , including the zero and infinite limits . in particular ,",
    "if we consider the dicke model with an arbitrary value of @xmath49 and first take the limit @xmath68 ( meaning that this is the most dominant infinite limit in the problem ) , the system effectively reduces to the lipkin - meshkov - glick model , which exhibits singular behaviour in the limit @xmath66 ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "we therefore conclude that the two limits @xmath20 and @xmath66 can not be unified in a nontrivial manner .",
    "in fact , the consideration of the thermodynamic limit provides at least a partial explanaton for why singular behaviour is obtained only in the limit @xmath20 in the single - qubit case . in the limit @xmath66",
    ", the phase transition occurs independently of the ratio @xmath26 .",
    "however , depending on the value of this ratio , the phase transition region involves larger changes in the lower - frequency subsystem , i.e.  either the collective state of the qubits or the state of the oscillator . in the limit @xmath20 , the state of the qubits only slightly deviates from the ground state when the transition point is crossed , and it is plausible that the singular behaviour would persist even when the ensemble of qubits is replaced by a single qubit . in the limit @xmath68 , the oscillator stays close to its ground state while the state of the qubit ensemble undergoes large changes upon crossing the transition point , a behaviour that clearly can not translate straightforwardly to the single - qubit case .",
    "we have analyzed the transition from an uncorrelated composite system to superradiance behaviour in the single - qubit  single - oscillator rabi model .",
    "we have shown that as the ratio of the oscillator s frequency to the qubit s frequency approaches zero , various physical quantities exhibit singular dependence that closely resembles that encountered in the study of the superradiance phase transition in the thermodynamic limit of the dicke model .",
    "the qubit - oscillator entanglement and appropriate qubit - oscillator correlation functions remain very small below the transition point but increase rapidly as soon as the coupling strength exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "the low - lying energy levels ( almost ) collapse to a single highly degenerate ground - state manifold at the transition point .",
    "the amount of squeezing also peaks in a singular manner at the critical point .",
    "the energy - level separations and the degree of squeezing scale as @xmath69 on both sides of the critical point , while the qubit - oscillator entanglement rises as @xmath70 above the critical point , with the exponent @xmath56 being slightly below unity .    in spite of the similarities in the behaviour of this system with the behaviour of the dicke model in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the analogy is not complete , as evidenced by the absence of a thermal phase transition in the single - qubit  single - oscillator system .",
    "the rabi model with arbitrary coupling strength remains an active area of research .",
    "recent studies have addressed questions related to the integrability of the model @xcite , various approximations and exact solutions @xcite , dynamics and dissipation @xcite , proposals of potentially robust designs for quantum bits @xcite and novel strongly correlated many - polariton states @xcite .",

    "<S> we consider the phase - transition - like behaviour in the rabi model containing a single two - level system , or qubit , and a single harmonic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the system experiences a sudden transition from an uncorrelated state to an increasingly correlated one as the qubit - oscillator coupling strength is varied and increased past a critical point . </S>",
    "<S> this singular behaviour occurs in the limit where the oscillator s frequency is much lower than the qubit s frequency ; away from this limit one obtains a finite - width transition region . by analyzing the energy - level structure , the value of the oscillator field and its squeezing and the qubit - oscillator correlation </S>",
    "<S> , we gain insight into the nature of the transition and the associated critical behaviour . </S>"
