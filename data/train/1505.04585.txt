    "<S> the segmentation performance of the g3pd method is compared to five state - of - the - art methods on a benchmark which comprises manually marked ground truth segmentation for 10560 images . </S>",
    "<S> performance evaluations show that the g3pd method consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of segmentation accuracy . </S>"
