    "( we shall say sometimes that @xmath0 is of codimension @xmath32 in @xmath2 . )",
    "the hypersurface case of this statement follows from works of lupacciolu , stout , chirka and others , with weaker regularity assumptions , @xmath2 being @xmath33-smooth , @xmath34-smooth or even a lipschitz graph ( _ see _ [ ls ] , [ cs ] ) , so theorem 1.1 is new essentially in codimension @xmath35 .",
    "recently , many geometrical removability results have been established in case the singularity @xmath0 is a submanifold ( _ see _ [ st ] , [ ls ] , [ cs ] , [ j2,3 ] , [ p1 ] , [ mp1,2,3 ] , [ js ] , [ p2 ] , [ mp4 ] ) and theorem 1.1 appears to answer one of the last open general questions in the subject ( _ see _ also [ j3 ] , [ mp4 ] for related open problems ) . as a rule @xmath4-removability follows once @xmath15-removability being established ( _ see _ especially proposition 2.11 in [ mp1 ] ) . in the case at hand",
    "we have already proved @xmath4-removability by different methods earlier ( theorem 3.1 in [ mp3 ] ) and also @xmath15-removability if @xmath2 is real analytic ( _ see _ [ mp2 , theorem 5.1 ] , with @xmath2 being @xmath36-smooth and @xmath31 ) .    for the special case where @xmath2 is @xmath37-smooth and levi - nondegenerate ( _ i.e. _  the convex hull of the image of the levi - form has nonempty interior ) , theorem  1.1 is due to dinh and sarkis [ ds ] .",
    "it is known that this assumption entails the dimensional inequality @xmath38 . especially , in the case of cr dimension @xmath39 , the abovementioned authors recover only the known hypersurface case ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we also point out a general restriction : by assuming that @xmath2 is levi - nondegenerate , or more generally that it is of bloom - graham finite type at _ every _ point of @xmath2 , one would not take account of propagation aspects for the regularity of cr functions .",
    "for instance , it is well known that wedge extendability may hold despite of large levi - flat regions in manifolds @xmath2 consisting of a single cr orbit ( _ cf . _",
    "[ trp ] , [ tu1,2 ] , [ j1 ] , [ m ] ) . for the sake of generality",
    ", this is why we only assume that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are globally minimal in theorem  1.1 .",
    "a straightforward application is as follows .",
    "first , by [ trp ] , [ tu1,2 ] , [ j1 ] , [ m , theorem 3.4 ] , as @xmath3 is globally minimal , there is a wedgelike domain @xmath41 attached to @xmath3 to which every continuous cr function ( resp .",
    "cr distribution ) @xmath25 on @xmath3 extends as a holomorphic function with continuous ( resp .",
    "distributional ) boundary value @xmath25 .",
    "then theorem  1.1 entails that there exists a wedge @xmath15 attached to @xmath2 such that every such @xmath25 extend holomorphically as an @xmath42 . there is _ a priori _ no growth control of @xmath43 up to @xmath0 .",
    "however , as proved in [ mp1 , proposition  2.11 ] , in the case where @xmath25 is an element of @xmath44 which is cr on @xmath3 , some growth control of hardy - spaces type can be achieved on @xmath43 to show that it admits a boundary value @xmath45 over @xmath2 ( including @xmath0 ) which is @xmath4 and cr on @xmath2 .",
    "this is how one may deduce @xmath4-removability from @xmath46-removability in theorem  1.1 .",
    "we now indicate a second application of theorem 1.1 to the extension of cr - meromorphic functions . this notion was introduced for hypersurfaces by harvey and lawson [ hl ] and for generic cr manifolds by dinh and sarkis .",
    "let @xmath25 be a cr - meromorphic function , namely : * 1 .",
    "* @xmath47 is a @xmath34-smooth mapping defined over a dense open subset @xmath48 of @xmath2 with values in the riemann sphere ; * 2 . *",
    "the closure @xmath49 of its graph in @xmath50 defines an oriented scarred @xmath51-smooth cr manifold of cr dimension @xmath52 ( _ i.e. _ cr outside a closed thin set ) and * 3 .",
    "* we assume that @xmath53=0 $ ] in the sense of currents ( _ see _ [ hl ] , [ sa ] , [ ds ] , [ mp2 ] for further definition ) . according to an observation of sarkis based on a counting dimension argument , the indeterminacy set @xmath54 of @xmath25 is a closed subset of empty interior in a two - codimensional scarred submanifold of @xmath2 and its scar set is always metrically thin  : @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , outside @xmath54 , @xmath25 defines a cr current in some suitable projective chart , hence it enjoys all the extendability properties of an usual cr function or distribution .",
    "however , the complement @xmath56 need not be globally minimal if @xmath2 is , and it is easy to construct manifolds @xmath2 and closed sets @xmath57 with @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) which perturb global minimality ( _ see _ [ mp1 ] , p.  811 ) .",
    "it is therefore natural to make the additional assumption that @xmath2 is minimal ( locally , in the sense of tumanov ) at _ every _ point , which seems to be the weakest assumption which insures that @xmath3 is globally minimal for arbitrary closed sets @xmath57 ( even with a bound on their hausdorff dimension ) .",
    "finally , under these circumstances , the set @xmath54 will be @xmath15-removable : for its regular part @xmath60 , this already follows from theorem 4 ( ii ) in [ mp1 ] and for its scar set @xmath61 , this follows from theorem 1.1 above .",
    "the removability of @xmath54 means that the envelope of holomorphy of every wedge @xmath21 attached to @xmath62 contains a wedge @xmath22 attached to @xmath2 . as envelopes of meromorphy and envelopes of holomorphy of domains in @xmath6 coincide by a theorem of ivashkovich ( [ i ] ) , we conclude  :    suppose @xmath2 is @xmath1-smooth and locally minimal at every point .",
    "then there exists a wedgelike domain @xmath15 attached to @xmath2 to which all cr - meromorphic functions on @xmath2 extend meromorphically .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to the proof of theorem  1.1 .",
    "we combine the _ local _ and the _ global _ techniques of deformations of analytic discs , using in an essential way two important papers of tumanov [ tu1 ] and of globevnik [ g1 ] . in sections  2 and 3",
    ", we first set up a standard local situation ( _ cf .",
    "_ [ mp1,2,3 ] ) .",
    "these preliminaries provide the necessary background for an informal discussion of the techniques of deformations of analytic discs we have to introduce .",
    "after these motivating remarks , a detailed presentation of the main part of the proof is provided in section  4 ( _ see _ especially main lemma  4.3 )",
    ".    acknowledgements .",
    "the authors would like to thank n. eisen and f. sarkis for instructing discussions in this subject .",
    "this article was conceived when the second author was visiting the latp , umr 6632 du cnrs , at the university of provence , aix - marseille i. the second author is very grateful to this institution for its hospitality .",
    "the following section contains important preliminary steps for the proof of theorem 1.1 ( _ cf . _ [ mp1,2,3 ] ) .    as in [ cs , p.96 ] , we shall proceed by contradiction , since this strategy simplifies the general reasonings in the large .",
    "also , in section  3 below , we shall explain how to reduce the question to the simpler case where the functions which we have to extend are even holomorphic near @xmath3 .",
    "whereas such a strategy is carried out in detail in [ mp1 ] ( with minor variations ) , we shall for completeness recall the complete reasonings briefly here , in sections  2 and  3 .    thus , we fix @xmath21 attached to @xmath3 and say that an open submanifold @xmath16 containing @xmath3 enjoys the _ @xmath15-extension property _ if there is a wedgelike domain @xmath63 attached to @xmath64 and a wedgelike set @xmath65 attached to @xmath66 such that , for each function @xmath67 , its restriction to @xmath68 extends holomorphically to @xmath63 .    this notion can be localized as follows .",
    "let @xmath69 be an arbitrary closed subset of @xmath0 .",
    "we shall say that a point @xmath70 is ( locally ) _ removable _ ( with respect to @xmath71 ) if for every wedgelike domain @xmath21 attached to @xmath72 , there exists a neighborhood @xmath73 of @xmath74 in @xmath2 and a wedgelike domain @xmath22 attached to @xmath75 such that for every holomorphic function @xmath76 , there exists a holomorphic function @xmath77 which coincides with @xmath25 in some wedgelike open set @xmath78 attached to @xmath72 .",
    "next , we define the following set of closed subsets of @xmath0 : @xmath79 then the residual set @xmath80 is closed . here , the letters `` nr '' abbreviate `` non - removable '' , since one expects _ a priori _ that no point of @xmath81 should be removable in the above sense .",
    "notice that for any two sets @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 consist of a single cr orbit and have nonempty intersection .",
    "hence @xmath85 is globally minimal and it follows that @xmath86 is globally minimal .    using ayrapetian s version of the edge of the wedge theorem ( _ see _ also [ tu1 , theorem  1.2 ] ) , the different wedgelike domains attached to the sets @xmath72 can be glued ( after appropriate contraction of their cone ) to a wedgelike domain @xmath21 attached to @xmath87 in such a way that @xmath86 enjoys the @xmath15-extension property . clearly , to establish theorem  1.1 , it is enough to show that @xmath88 .",
    "let us argue indirectly ( by contradiction ) and assume that @xmath89 .",
    "with respect to the ordering of sets by the inclusion relation , @xmath81 is then the minimal non - removable subset of @xmath0 . in order to derive a contradiction to the minimality of @xmath90",
    ", it suffices therefore to remove one single point @xmath91 .",
    "more precisely one has to look for a neighborhood @xmath92 of @xmath20 such that @xmath93 is globally minimal and has the @xmath15-extension property .    in order to achieve the first required property",
    ", it is very convenient to choose the point @xmath20 such that locally the singularity @xmath81 lies behind a `` wall '' through @xmath20 .",
    "more precisely we shall construct a generic hypersurface @xmath94 containing @xmath20 such that a neighborhood @xmath95 of @xmath20 in @xmath2 writes as the disjoint union @xmath96 of connected sets , where @xmath97 are two open `` sides '' , and the inclusion @xmath98 holds true . since @xmath99 is a generic cr manifold , there is a cr vector field @xmath100 on @xmath2 defined in a neighborhood of @xmath20 which is transverse to @xmath99 . by integrating @xmath100 ,",
    "one easily finds a basis of neighborhoods @xmath73 of @xmath20 in @xmath2 such that @xmath101 is globally minimal .",
    "hence it remains to establish the @xmath15-extension property at @xmath20 , which is the main task .",
    "for sake of completeness , we recall from [ mp1 ] how to construct the generic wall @xmath99 .",
    "there is a point @xmath102 and a @xmath103-smooth generic hypersurface @xmath94 passing through @xmath104 so that @xmath105 lies near @xmath104 on one side of @xmath99 @xmath106see figure  1@xmath107 .",

    "after shortening @xmath109 , we may suppose that @xmath112 and that @xmath109 is a smoothly embedded segment .",
    "therefore @xmath109 can be described as a part of an integral curve of some nonvanishing @xmath113-smooth cr vector field ( section of @xmath114 ) @xmath115 defined in a neighborhood of @xmath20 .",

    ", we may assume that @xmath123 corresponds to a point of @xmath109 close to @xmath20 which is not contained in @xmath124 , again denoted by @xmath125 .",

    "the explicit construction of @xmath335 allows an easy determination of the partial indices .",
    "we begin by constructing @xmath517 holomorphic vector fields along @xmath458 which generate ( over @xmath518 ) the tangent bundle of @xmath335 .",

    "we obtain @xmath525 , @xmath523 .    by [ g1 , proposition 10.2 ] ,",
    "the maximal number of linearly independent holomorphically extendable sections equals the number of non - negative partial indices .",
    "hence we deduce that all @xmath464 are non - negative .",
    "furthermore it is easy to see that the total index @xmath28 , which is twice the winding number of @xmath526 around @xmath204 , equals @xmath233 .",

    "this heuristic argument can be made precise in the following way .",

    "the only possible constellations for the partial indices are @xmath531 , @xmath204 and @xmath532 .",

    "this choice of smoothness is very adapted to our purpose . indeed ,",
    "using cut - off functions and the weierstrass approximation theorem , we can construct a @xmath210-smooth maximally real manifold @xmath538 to which @xmath239 is still attached and which is also _ real analytic _ in a neighborhood of @xmath539 .",
