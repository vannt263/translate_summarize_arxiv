    "quasars are believed to be powered by supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) rapidly growing by accreting matter at a large fraction of their eddington rate which , assuming the typical quasar sed of @xcite , corresponds to @xmath30  . we will therefore also refer to obscured agns as obscured quasars if they have @xmath30  . ] .",
    "the accreted matter forms a disk , is heated to temperatures of @xmath31  k , and emits thermal emission at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "clouds of gas ionised by this radiation will emit line radiation , and lines which are relatively close to the black hole have rapid orbits which will show broad velocity dispersions ( @xmath322000 km  s@xmath1 ) , while clouds further away will show narrower lines .",
    "dust can survive when the equilibrium temperature with the ultraviolet photons is @xmath332000  k. this dust absorbs optical and ultraviolet radiation and re - emits it at infrared wavelengths characteristic of the dust temperature .",
    "if the line of sight of an observer to the central region is blocked by dust , the optical and ultraviolet continuum , as well as the broad lines , will not be observable .",
    "such a source is known as an obscured quasar .    while radio - loud obscured quasars have been known for a long time , in the form of high - excitation narrow - line radio galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , the population of radio - quiet obscured quasars had remained elusive , with only a few individual objects known .",
    "this has changed recently , when large numbers of these sources have been found in the spectroscopic database of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "samples of spectroscopically - confirmed obscured quasars have now also been identified in surveys using x - ray selection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as mid - infrared , sometimes combined with radio , selection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "it seems that the obscured quasars are at least as common as the the unobscured quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "there is a large body of evidence supporting obscuration of quasars as an orientation effect , where obscured and unobscured quasars are intrinsically identical sources , only dust around the accretion disk covers certain lines of sight so that the broad emission lines and the optical and ultraviolet continuum are not visible ( the dusty torus of the unified schemes , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , dust distributed within the host galaxy can also cause obscuration , particularly if the galaxy is at an early evolutionary phase and is rich in gas and dust ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the importance of galaxy - scale dust is evident in recent studies of quasars where obscuration can not be solely assigned to dust from a torus around the accretion disk : in some objects even the narrow - lines are obscured @xcite .",
    "the jets emanating from some obscured quasars are face - on @xcite , something that is not expected for quasars obscured by the torus , but can be explained if the obscuring dust is on a larger ( @xmath8kpc ) scale .",
    "the deep silicate absorption features and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) suggest foreground extinction is sometimes present @xcite .",
    "this all provides indirect evidence suggesting obscuring dust on @xmath8  kpc scales , something which has been spectroscopically confirmed through the measurement of the h@xmath34 to h@xmath35 balmer decrement @xcite .",
    "dust present on kpc scales is expected to be relatively cool ( @xmath3650  k ) and will emit thermally in the far - infrared ( @xmath3740  @xmath11 m ) , regardless of whether it is heated by young stars or by the central active galactic nucleus .",
    "observing this dust around the peak of its emission ( around rest - frame @xmath865  @xmath11 m ) is not optimal , since warmer dust can still contribute significantly there .",
    "the rayleigh - jeans tail of the emission , however , will have a much smaller contribution from warm dust , and has the additional advantage of being observable from the ground , for example in the atmospheric windows at 850  @xmath11 m or 1.2  mm .",
    "in this paper we present continuum observations of a sample of 21 high - redshift ( @xmath382 ) radio - intermediate obscured quasars at 1.2  mm , combined with other infrared and submillimetre data , as well as a search for co in two of the sources .",
    "the sample was selected to approximately match the break in the unobscured luminosity function at @xmath12 ( @xmath39 - 25.7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so in terms of radiation these quasars represent the energetically - dominant population around the peak of the quasar activity .",
    "the sources are , however , radio - intermediate in that their radio luminosities are slightly higher than those expected from radio - quiet quasars ( with @xmath40 @xmath41  w  hz@xmath1  sr@xmath1 * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , observations with very large baseline interferometry suggest the relative importance of the compact cores makes them more similar to the genuinely radio - quiet population than to the radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the sample of obscured quasars was observed at a wavelength of 1.2  mm ( 250  ghz ) using the 117-element max - planck millimetre bolometer array ( mambo - ii * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter simply mambo ) , at the iram pico de veleta 30  m telescope .",
    "the observations were carried out in `` on - off '' mode during the mambo pool at the iram 30  m telescope throughout various semesters .",
    "ams16 was observed in winter 2005 - 2006 , while the remaining objects were observed between summer 2007 ( sum07 ) and winter 2007 - 2008 ( win07 ) . due to a warning issued by iram ( see below ) , the objects detected during the win07 pool were re - observed in summer 2008 ( sum08 ) and winter 2008 - 2009 ( win08 ) .    to minimise the effect of atmospheric absorption , the science targets were observed whenever possible at elevations @xmath4245  deg , and often at around 60  deg .",
    "observing at elevations higher than 75  deg is , however , not possible with the 30  m telescope .",
    "for the first - order removal of the sky , the observations make use of a secondary mirror to chop ( or `` wobble '' ) , with a typical azimuthal throw of 32 to 45 arcsec and a chopping frequency of 2  hz . the on - off observations are done by nodding , so that the sky - only position sampled by the chopping is alternatively on the right or on the left of the sky - plus - source position . each nod position ( on or off )",
    "is observed for one minute , and to minimise overheads an on - off - off - on sequence is used .",
    "hence integration blocks ( `` scans '' ) are multiples of 4 minutes .",
    "the on - off observations were carried out centred on the most sensitive pixel , number 20 , with the atmospheric opacity @xmath43 and medium - to - low sky noise ( @xmath33200  mjy beam@xmath1 ) . each source",
    "was typically observed in several blocks of 20 minute integrations .",
    "the `` sky - only '' position can sometimes fall on a real astronomical source .",
    "given that high - redshift agns are often found to have ( sub)millimetre - bright galaxies nearby @xcite , there is a real risk of ruining the sky subtraction by chopping onto a bright source . to minimise the risk of this happening ( and the impact on the final data ) , the chop angle ( `` wobbler throw '' )",
    "was alternatively varied between 32 , 35 and 42 arcsec , and observations were carried out on different dates and at different times of the day .",
    "this means the chop in azimuth corresponds to different physical offsets in ra and dec , so the chance of repeatedly falling on the same astronomical source is minimised .    throughout the observing",
    "runs , gain calibration was performed by observing neptune , uranus or mars , and the flux calibration was always found to be accurate to @xmath4420% .",
    "the gain calibration was also monitored regularly by observing other sources with known bright millimetre fluxes ( @xmath425  jy ) .",
    "total power measurements at different elevations were made to infer the atmospheric opacity ( `` skydip '' ) .",
    "these were performed typically every 2 hours under stable weather conditions , and at shorter intervals for less stable conditions .",
    "the skydips were generally done with the telescope azimuthal angle matched to that of the science targets .",
    "the focus of the telescope was also regularly monitored on bright sources . before the first science target and every 40 minutes the accuracy of the telescope pointing",
    "was checked using the nearby source j1638@xmath45573 ( 0.6  jy ) .",
    "observations of j1638@xmath45573 and other bright sources were also used to check for anomalous refraction , in which case no science observations were made .    during the observations , the sensitivity of mambo in a 1 second integration was typically between 35 and 45 mjy beam@xmath1 . including typically 60% overheads , the observations of this sample of 21 obscured quasars totalled approximately 65  hours .",
    "the data were reduced using the mopsic pipeline ( developed by r. zylka ) .",
    "mopsic removes the atmospheric emission using the two chopper positions .",
    "the sky noise is measured by taking the weighted mean of the correlated signal from adjacent pixels , and subsequently removed .",
    "the mambo pixels are separated in the array by two beams and weak point sources ( @xmath25150  mjy ) will therefore not be detected in adjacent pixels . using the measurements of the atmospheric opacity from the skydips , and the elevation at which objects",
    "were observed , the extinction due to atmospheric water vapour is then corrected .",
    "gain calibration converts counts to flux density , and finally , for each science target the weighted mean of all the scans is taken .",
    "these are the flux densities quoted in table  [ tab : obs ] : a relatively uniform root mean square ( rms ) noise @xmath80.55  mjy beam@xmath1 was achieved for most of the sources , with only a few sources having an rms @xmath80.7 - 0.9 mjy beam@xmath1 .    in september",
    "2008 iram issued a warning to mambo observers : several technical problems had ocurred during the win07 semester , which included thermal and electric malfunctions in the preamplifier , heightened sensitivity of the bolometer to microphotonics and spikes in the detected signal .",
    "these problems were expected to affect a fraction of the scans , and the warning suggested that any @xmath2510  mjy detections obtained during this semester should be checked .",
    "four of sources from this sample were detected during win07 : ams07 , ams08 ams12 and ams17 . all four were observed again during the win08 period , together with extra scans of ams10 , ams11 and ams20 . the data for win07 and win08 were reduced independently , with the results shown in table  [ tab:07_08 ] .",
    "the win07 flux densities are systematically higher , so only sources detected in the sum08/win08 period are considered safe detections .",

    "we used the sweep mode of sharc - ii to observe the sources : in this mode the telescope moves in a lissajous pattern that keeps the central regions of the maps fully sampled , but causes the edges to be much noisier than the central regions .",
    "pointing was checked with uranus and secondary object crl_16293 - 2422 several times during the observations .",
    "the pointing accuracy is better than 3 arcsec .",

    "we used starlink s `` stats '' package to measure the flux of the calibrator and estimate the noise of the image .",
    "the resulting root - mean - square noise values for ams13 and ams16 are 7.0 mjy beam@xmath1 and 5.5 mjy beam@xmath1 , respectively , and neither source is detected at the 3@xmath48 level .",
    "two sources , ams12 and ams16 were observed using the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) to search for molecular gas in the host galaxies , by using carbon monoxide ( co ) as a tracer of the molecular gas .",
    "ams16 was the first object observed with mambo , in 2005 . at the redshift of the source , @xmath49 , the co ( 4 - 3 ) rotational transition falls in the 3  mm atmospheric window [ where ( 4 - 3 ) stands for the transition from the @xmath50 to the @xmath51 angular quantum numbers ] .",

    "the continuum rms is 0.1  mjy beam@xmath1 , and no continuum is detected at 3  mm , so that we obtain a 3@xmath48 limit of @xmath530.3  mjy . in the case of ams16 ,",
    "the lack of continuum sets an 3@xmath48 upper limit on the 89  ghz ( 3  mm ) flux density of @xmath530.2  mjy .",
    "the millimetre continuum observations provide us with a wealth of information about the far - infrared luminosities and cool - dust masses of our sources .",
    "they can also be used to test whether there is enough dust along the host galaxy to cause the obscuration in the quasars . in the following section ,",
    "we derive these physical properties from our observations .    the data uniformly available for this sample includes the following wavelengths : 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , 24 , 70 and 160  @xmath11 m , as well as 1.2  mm .",
    "for a small number of sources data is also available at 350 or 850  @xmath11 m .",
    "with such excellent wavelength coverage , one might expect the far - infrared luminosities and cool - dust masses to be very accurately constrained .",
    "however , the wavelengths corresponding to the rest - frame mid - infrared are dominated by hot dust from the warm torus around the central engine , and can not be used to constrain the cool - dust component as we explain below .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity is dominated by cool dust , expected to be characterised by temperatures @xmath835 - 50  k. this means that emission is expected to peak around 65 - 90  @xmath11 m and drop exponentially at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the emission from the warm torus is caused by dust at a range of temperatures , typically @xmath8100 - 2000  k , whose emission will peak at shorter wavelengths than that of the cool dust .",
    "if the agn is powerful enough , as is the case in the sources making up this sample , the dust emission from the torus will dominate at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "hence , the mid - infrared emission is not useful in constraining the cool dust mass and luminosity .    to illustrate this , figure  [ fig : illu ] shows a model rest - frame sed consisiting of cool dust modelled by a gray body with temperature @xmath54  k and emissivity @xmath55 together with a model agn torus from the radiative transfer models of @xcite .",
    "the spitzer mips bands at 24 , 70 and 160  @xmath11 m , as well as the mambo band at 1.2  mm have been marked in gray , assuming this source to be at @xmath5 .",
    "the emission seen at 1.2  mm will be completely dominated by the cool dust , while the emission at 24  @xmath11 m will be completely dominated by the warm dust of the torus .",
    "the 70  @xmath11 m band is expected to be dominated by the torus , with some contribution from the cooler dust , while the situation for the emission observed at 160  @xmath11 m is expected to be reverse : the cool dust dominates with some contribution from the torus .",
    "this is only an illustration , and the relative importance of each component will vary depending on the actual temperature of the cool dust , the actual sed of the torus and their relative luminosities .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : illu ] does show that when a powerful agn is present , the data at 24 and 70  @xmath11 m and the mid - infrared spectra will not provide very powerful constraints on the cool - dust emission .",
    "it is the data at 1.2  mm that will provide the best measurement of this emission . the data at 160  @xmath11 m should provide useful constraints but for most sources in our sample it is too shallow to provide detections . data at 350 or 850  @xmath11 m is extremely useful but is only available for 3 sources .",
    "hence , we will determine the far - infrared luminosities based on the flux densities at 1.2  mm alone for most of the sources in this sample . for sources where the data at 160 , 350 or 850  @xmath11 m provide a useful constrain",
    ", we will make use of this data too .",
    "however , the 24  @xmath11 m data will not be used to constrain the cool dust emission ( and in most cases , neither will the 70  @xmath11 m data ) .",
    "the mambo observations yield detections at the @xmath423@xmath48 level for 5 out of 21 sources observed ( 24% ) .",
    "the results are summarised in table  [ tab : obs ] and figure  [ fig : s_z ] ( where sources with no spectroscopic redshift were placed at @xmath56 , the median for sources with a spectroscopic redshift ) .",
    "the mean noise achieved is 0.56  mjy beam@xmath1 , the median is 0.54  mjy beam@xmath1 .",
    "hence , for the non detections , typical 3@xmath48 limits @xmath81.65  mjy are obtained .",
    "with 76% of the sources undetected , the median flux density does not provide a useful characteristic number for the sample .",
    "a more meaningful number is the mean flux density at 1.2  mm for the entire sample .",
    "the flux densities of all sources were therefore combined using a weighted mean :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 .",
    "this yielded a statistical detection , with @xmath59 mjy .",
    "a potential worry is that a few bright sources might be causing the statistical detection , while the rest of the sources are intrinsically faint .",
    "stacking only the non - detections still yields a detection at the 3.9@xmath48 level : @xmath60 mjy . stacking all the detections",
    "leads to a mean flux density of @xmath61 mjy .",
    "figure  [ fig : dbn_s ] shows the distribution of flux densities ( from table  [ tab : obs ] ) , which is centred on a positive value and skewed towards the higher flux densities .",
    "this figure supports the statement that the typical flux density of an object from this sample is @xmath80.5 - 1.0  mjy .",
    "if the actual flux densities of the sources were so low that the distribution were dominated by the noise , figure  [ fig : dbn_s ] would be centred on 0 , with a symmetric characteristic width @xmath80.55  mjy , and only a slight skew towards the high fluxes ( the detections with @xmath62@xmath631.65  mjy ) .",
    "we now consider whether the detection at 1.2  mm is related to the presence or lack of narrow lines in the optical spectra .",
    "of the 5 detections at 1.2  mm , 4 show narrow lines ( 80% ) and only 1 ( 20% ) has a blank optical spectrum ( ams19 ) .",
    "alternatively , of the 9 objects with narrow lines , 4 have detections at 1.2  mm ( 44% ) , while of the 12 with no narrow lines , only 1 is detected ( 8% ) . due to the small numbers , no trend is significant , but at first sight the data hints that sources with narrow lines are more likely to be detected at 1.2  mm .",
    "looking at the stacked flux densities for narrow - line and for blank objects ( no narrow lines ) suggests the dust content to be similar : the weighted mean for narrow - line sources is 1.09@xmath150.16  mjy , while for blank sources it is 0.81@xmath150.16  mjy , so both are statistically detected .",
    "although at first sight the difference appears significant , the narrow - line objects include ams12 with a flux of 3.7  mjy which is affecting the mean : the mean of the other 8 narrow line objects excluding ams12 is 0.76  mjy , very similar to that of the objects with no narrow lines .",
    "hence , the mean mm flux densities for both narrow line and blank objects appear similar .      given a flux density ,",
    "the infrared luminosity of a gray body is given by :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is planck s constant , @xmath66 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath67 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath68 is the luminosity distance at redshift @xmath69 .",
    "the terms @xmath70 and @xmath71 refer to observed and rest - frame frequency respectively , @xmath72 .",
    "the term @xmath73 is the planck radiation function :    @xmath74    figure  [ fig : lir ] and table  [ tab : infer ] show the inferred values of @xmath6 assuming two different gray bodies , one with @xmath75  k and @xmath76 ( representative of unobscured quasars at high redshift , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the other with @xmath77  k and @xmath55 ( representative of submillimetre - selected galaxies , smgs , see * ? ? ?",
    "the value of @xmath78 , also assuming @xmath56 , corresponds to @xmath796.3@xmath150.7@xmath80   ( @xmath75  k and @xmath76 ) or 1.6@xmath150.2@xmath80   ( for @xmath77  k and @xmath55 ) .",
    "hence , the obscured quasars are typically ultra - luminous in the far - infrared , with a characteristic luminosity of @xmath7   ( the mean of both values ) .    despite the range in spectroscopic redshifts ( 1.6 @xmath814.2 ) , the relatively flat selection function at 1.2",
    "mm means that the detection of sources is primarily determined by their far - infrared luminosities , and is only weakly dependent on redshift ( see figure  [ fig : lir ] ) .",
    "in fact , for a given flux density , the corresponding far - infrared luminosity is actually smaller at high redshift .",
    "hence intrinsically less luminous objects are easier to detect at higher redshift .",
    "this probably explains why in our sample , the higher redshift sources ( @xmath382 ) have a slightly higher detection rate than the lower redshift sources ( @xmath822 ) .",
    "the luminosity arising in the far - infrared is a considerable fraction of the agn bolometric luminosity ( @xmath83 , between infrared and x - ray energies , so between @xmath84 and @xmath85 hz ) which is typically @xmath86   for our sample ( see section  [ sec : broad ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath6 is typically @xmath80.1 - 0.3@xmath83 depending on the assumed gray body .",

    "the dust responsible for this emission must be directly illuminated by the accretion disk , and must be relatively close to the source of ultraviolet photons : it is likely to originate in the inner region of the torus .",

    "again , our results provide evidence for obscuration due to dust on kpc scales , dust that has lower temperatures and is distributed on larger scales than what is expected for the dust of the torus .",
    "figure  [ fig : mean_comp ] shows the mid - infrared component of the mean sed with the spectra of four local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies overplotted ( ulirgs , with @xmath148 l@xmath149 ) .",
    "the spectra for these sources were obtained from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these ulirgs represent one pure - agn , iras  12514@xmath451027 ( hereafter iras  12514 ) , two agn - starburst composites , mrk  231 and mrk  273 , and one starburst - dominated source , arp  220 .",
    "all spectra have been normalised to match our mean sed between 7.0 and 7.8  @xmath11 m ( around 4@xmath150  hz ) .",
    "compared to these sources , our mean sed is relatively flat , similarly to mrk  231 or iras  12514 , yet the silicate absorption feature is significantly deeper , more similar to that of mrk  273 or even arp  220 .",
    "once again , we see the peculiar spectral shape of this mean sed , where the silicate feature is suprisingly deep given the relative flatness of the continuum .",
    "the most similar nearby ulirg is iras  12514 , which is known to be an obscured quasar @xcite , although this source has a shallower feature at 9.7  @xmath11 m .",
    "two sources , ams12 and ams16 , were observed with the iram pdbi to search for the co ( 3 - 2 ) or ( 4 - 3 ) rotational transitions , tracers of molecular gas .",
    "the co ( 3 - 2 ) line in ams12 is clearly detected , and is well described by a gaussian with a peak flux of 2.14  mjy and a full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 275  km  s@xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig : coams12 ] ) .",
    "the integrated line flux of this gaussian is @xmath14630@xmath1550 mjy  km  s@xmath1 , where @xmath151 is the velocity - integrated co line flux .",
    "this corresponds to a ( frequency - integrated ) luminosity of @xmath163.2@xmath17  , or a brightness - temperature luminosity of @xmath152 k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath19 .",
    "the central frequency of the line is at -16  km  s@xmath1 , corresponding to a frequency shift of 4.9  mhz ( so a central frequency of 91.801  ghz ) , so the redshift of the co line is @xmath153 . at our signal to noise ,",
    "the line shape is well described by a gaussian , there is no double profile visible , which could suggest a disk .",
    "there is also no hint of two separate lines which could suggest that the molecular gas is undergoing a major merger .    in the case of ams16 ,",
    "no line was detected ( see figure  [ fig : coams16 ] ) .",
    "the full data cube was searched by looking for line emission at various spectral resolutions , using a routine provided by roberto neri , but no significant emission was detected at the position of the source .",
    "a signal at the 4.5  @xmath48 level can be seen at 17  19  44 @xmath4558  47  00 . if real this would correspond to a line offset from the narrow - line redshift by @xmath8600  km  s@xmath1 and with a full width at zero intensity of @xmath8850  km  s@xmath1 . however , the position does not correspond to any source detectable in the r - band , 3.6  @xmath11 m or 1.4  ghz image .",
    "this position corresponds to a 17  arcsec offset , or 116  kpc at the redshift of the source .",
    "we do not consider this emission any further",
    ".    the lack of detection of the co  ( 4 - 3 ) line can either be due to the line being shifted outside of the observed bandwidth ( @xmath1541680 km  s@xmath1 shift ) , or the line being within the bandwidth but too faint .",
    "the redshift was determined from three narrow lines , ly  @xmath34 ( 1216   ) , n  iv ( 1240   ) and c  iv ( 1549   ) with individual redshifts of @xmath155 , 4.166 and 4.170 respectively ( see martnez - sansigre et al . , 2006a ) .",
    "thus the maximum redshift offset of any individual line , with respect to the average @xmath156 is that of the n  iv line with @xmath157 , which only corresponds to a 175  km  s@xmath1 offset .    given the bandwidth used , we consider the possibility that the co  ( 4 - 3 ) line falls outside of the observed range unlikely , so detection of co  ( 4 - 3 ) in ams16 can be ruled out down to a 3@xmath48 limit of @xmath1580.23 jy km  s@xmath1 , assuming a box - car line shape with full width to zero intensity of 400  km  s@xmath1 . from these limits , we now estimate the limits on the co ( 4 - 3 ) luminosities and derived molecular gas properties .",
    "figure  [ fig : coams16 ] shows the spectrum extracted at the position of ams16 .    at @xmath49",
    ", @xmath159230 mjy km  s@xmath1 corresponds to a frequency - integrated line luminosity of @xmath1603@xmath17  , or a brightness - temperature luminosity of @xmath161 k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath19 .      if we assume the molecular gas responsible for the co emission is dense enough and warm enough for the ( 3 - 2 ) or ( 4 - 3 ) transitions to be thermalised , then the brightness - temperature luminosities of these high - j transitions are the same as that of the ( 1 - 0 ) transition : @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "following @xcite , we can then estimate an upper limit on the mass of molecular hydrogen , by using    @xmath164    where @xmath1650.8",
    "( k km  s@xmath1 ) @xmath1 is the conversion factor for local ulirgs @xcite .",

    "the values of @xmath176 are ultimately derived from the quantity @xmath177 and are thus also at the low end of the observed values .",
    "a possible explanation for the high values of @xmath177 is that a fraction of the far - infrared luminosity is due to agn heated dust , rather than by dust heated by young stars .",

    "the inferred mass is then @xmath183  , and is obviously dependent on the unknown inclination angle @xmath184 .",
    "the ratio of gas to dynamical mass is then @xmath185 .",

    "* s05 ) , with similar values of @xmath83 to our sample , @xmath191 .",
    "they were observed at 850  @xmath11 m with 6 out of 19 sources detected at the @xmath2 level ( 32% ) .    in all samples ,",
    "the bolometric luminosities have been estimated consistently using the @xcite sed , and correcting for absorption at x - ray energies ( s05 ) or dust - extinction at optical wavelengths ( this sample ) .",
    "the far - infrared luminosities have all been computed assuming a gray body with @xmath75  k , @xmath76 .",
    "changing these parameters will affect very similarly the far - infrared luminosities of all samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfir_lbol1 ] shows @xmath6 vs @xmath83 for the four samples of @xmath12 quasars .",
    "the coloured symbols represent the individual sources , the black filled symbols the mean values for each sample , and the black empty symbols the mean of the non - detections .",
    "the dashed line shows a constant far - infrared fraction of @xmath192 , characteristic of the low - redshift quasars studied by @xcite .    from the available data ,",
    "the o03 and p04 samples as a whole have a ratio of @xmath193 similar to the low - redshift quasars . however , our sample and the s05 samples both seem to have larger far - infrared fractions than the o03 and p04 samples .",
    "if all obscuration were orientation dependent then the host galaxies of obscured and unobscured quasars would be expected to have , on average , the same properties , such as star - formation rates and cool dust content . if , however , some obscured quasars are at a different evolutionary stage , then their host galaxy can be reasonably expected to have a larger gas and dust content , which might be causing the obscuration , or at least contributing to it",
    ". obscured quasars might therefore be in a different evolutionary phase to unobscured quasars .",
    "the extinction due to dust is negligible in the far - infrared ( fir ) , so that at wavelengths @xmath194  @xmath11 m the emission becomes essentially isotropic .",
    "hence , if orientation is the only difference between obscured and unobscured quasars , they should have virtually identical cool dust properties , irrespective of whether this emission is due to dust heated by the quasar or by young stars in the host galaxy .",
    "although it is difficult to quantify the significance of the difference between samples , it seems that optically obscured quasars ( and optically - unobscured but x - ray absorbed quasars ) have , on average , higher far - infrared luminosities than unobscured quasars . in turn",
    ", this implies that the cool - dust content of the host galaxies are different so that , on average , obscured quasars are hosted by dustier galaxies .",
    "this is , of course , partly a result of selection .",
    "the samples selected to contain obscured sources will of course be biased towards dustier objects , but such a bias will only show in the far - infrared observations if obscuring dust on kpc scales is important ( as opposed to dust in the torus only , which will emit mostly at mid - infrared wavelengths ) . the s05 sample is particularly biased towards such host obscuration , since it contains optically - bright quasars that are not obscured by the torus , but which show absorption at x - ray energies .",
    "hence , the difference in far - infrared luminosities between obscured and unobscured quasars lends strong support to the scenario that some of the obscuring dust is in the host galaxy , not only the torus , and there is a hint that many obscured quasars might represent a different evolutionary phase to unobscured quasars .",
    "we have observed a sample of @xmath0 radio - intermediate obscured quasars at 1.2  mm ( 250  ghz ) using mambo . the detection rate is 5 out of 21 ( 24% ) .",
    "sources with narrow lines seem to have a higher detection rate than sources with no narrow lines , but with such small numbers the difference is not significant .",
    "larger samples will be required to study any differences .",
    "stacking leads to a statistical detection of @xmath195 .",
    "even if only the non - detections are stacked , they still yield a statistical detection , with @xmath196 .",
    "thus , the typical flux density of this sample is @xmath80.5 - 1.0  mjy , and this corresponds to a far - infrared luminosity @xmath7  .",
    "if the far - infrared luminosity is powered entirely by star - formation , and not by agn - heated dust , then the typical inferred star - formation rate is @xmath8700  .",
    "this large star - formation rate is comparable to those inferred in ulirgs and smgs , the most powerful starburst galaxies known .",
    "the observations at 1.2  mm also allow us to estimate the mass of the cool dust , and we find a typical mass of @xmath10  .",
    "if heated by young stars , this dust is expected to be distributed on @xmath82  kpc scales ( the scale found for smgs ) .",
    "if it is heated by the central agn , with @xmath83@xmath93  , then it is expected to be distributed on scales @xmath3310  kpc .",
    "combining our observations at mid - infrared and millimetre wavelengths , we present dust seds for our sample , and derive a typical sed for our sample of high - redshift obscured quasars .",
    "the clumpy tori models can not reproduce the sed .",
    "however , clumpy tori models with an additional screen of cold dust ( and the corresponding far - infrared emission ) do reproduce this mean sed .",
    "the amount of extinction from this additional screen is derived from the cool dust mass , from the observations at 1.2  mm .",
    "the depth of the silicate feature can be consistently achieved by the inferred cool dust mass provided that the dust is on scales @xmath332  kpc , which is in excellent agreement with the typical radius of the far - infrared emission in smgs .",
    "again , this lends support to kpc - scale dust along the host galaxy playing an important role in the obscuration of these sources .",
    "obscuration by dust on kpc scales would also explain why in about half of the sample the narrow emission lines from the central agn are not detectable , as well as why in some cases the jets seem to be pointing towards us , something unexpected if they are only obscured by the torus of the unified schemes .",
    "however , we remind the reader that unobscured quasars have also been found to have similar cool - dust masses , and that in our sample there is not a one - to - one correspondence between the presence ( or lack of ) narrow lines and detection at 1.2  mm .",
    "the presence of a large mass of dust does not guarantee obscuration .",
    "a clumpy dusty interstellar medium where different lines of sight have vastly different optical depths is a likely explanation for why some quasars with large dust masses are obscured while others are not .    when comparing to other samples of high - redshift quasars , we find that the obscured quasars probably have a higher fraction of their luminosity emerging at far - infrared wavelengths , compared to unobscured quasars .",
    "the far - infrared emission is isotropic , so that this difference can not be ascribed to orientation - dependent obscuration : obscured quasars are likely to have higher far - infrared luminosities and cool - dust masses than unobscured quasars , suggesting the host galaxies are in a dustier , presumably earlier , phase .",
    "additionally , we have searched for molecular gas in two sources at @xmath13 and 4.169 , using the co ( 3 - 2 ) and ( 4 - 3 ) transitions . in the @xmath13 source",
