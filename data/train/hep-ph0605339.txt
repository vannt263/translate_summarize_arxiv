    "while no clear experimental evidence for the higgs boson has been found so far , even today the standard model is accurately tested and the higgs boson mass @xmath1 strongly constrained through precision measurements of @xmath6- and @xmath7-boson properties .",
    "one of the most important observables in this context is the effective leptonic weak mixing angle @xmath0 .",
    "it can be defined through the vertex form factors for the vector and axial - vector interactions between the @xmath6 boson and fermions @xmath8 : @xmath9 with the @xmath10 the effective couplings in the vertex @xmath11 .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath0 is derived from various asymmetries measured at the @xmath6 resonance pole .",
    "the precision of the current experimental value @xmath12 @xcite could be improved by about one order of magnitude by a future linear collider experiment @xcite . since the radiative corrections to @xmath0",
    "depend sensitively on the value of @xmath1 , the high experimental precision allows to put strong constraints on the higgs boson mass when the standard model is assumed to be valid .",
    "thus a lot of effort has been put into accurate theoretical calculations for @xmath0 .",
    "while one - loop corrections and two- and three - loop qcd corrections have been known for several years @xcite , only recently the fermionic two - loop corrections , i.e. the two - loop contributions with at least one closed fermion loop , were computed in @xcite and confirmed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , leading three - loop effects of order @xmath13 and @xmath14 for large values of the top quark mass @xmath15 have been calculated @xcite , as well as the behavior of the full @xmath16 corrections for large @xmath1 @xcite . finally , the precision of the qcd corrections to the universal part , the @xmath17 parameter , has been pushed to the four - loop level @xcite .",
    "however , for the remaining bosonic two - loop corrections , only a partial result for the @xmath1-dependent diagrams is available so far @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to finalize the calculation of the @xmath18 two - loop corrections by giving a complete result for the bosonic two - loop contributions .    at tree - level ,",
    "the effective weak mixing angle is identical to the on - shell weak mixing angle @xmath19 .",
    "the effect of higher - order corrections to the @xmath20 vertex can be summarized in the quantity @xmath21 , @xmath22 where for the purpose of this work , it is understood that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined in the on - shell scheme .",
    "the most precise result for @xmath0 is obtained when using the fermi constant @xmath25 instead of @xmath23 as input .",
    "then the calculation of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath25 involves also the computation of the radiative corrections to the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "this has been carried out with complete electroweak two - loop corrections in @xcite . in this letter ,",
    "the remaining bosonic two - loop corrections to the form factor @xmath21 are presented .",
    "any higher order calculation consists of two parts : the computation of the bare diagrams and the determination of the renormalization constants .",
    "the latter has been discussed at length in connection to two - loop electroweak precision observables in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we are , therefore , left with the calculation of the bare diagrams , which in our case , are massive two - loop three - point functions with two massless and one massive external leg .    just as in the case of the fermionic corrections @xcite , there are three mass scales in the problem , with the difference that there is no dependence on the top quark , but on the higgs boson mass .",
    "this is , however , an important difference , because contrary to @xmath15 , @xmath1 is not a fixed parameter and can assume a broad range of values . from the many possible strategies that one might apply , we chose to expand in the various parameters in order to obtain a result expressed through single scale integrals , which are in fact just numbers to be determined in a final step .",
    "in a first step , we apply an expansion in the difference of the masses of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 bosons , where the expansion parameter is just @xmath26 . since there are diagrams where there is a threshold when @xmath27 , the appearance of divergences at higher orders in the expansion is inevitable .",
    "in this case , we apply the method of expansions by regions , see @xcite .",
    "the two regions that contribute to the result come from the _ ultrasoft momenta _",
    ", @xmath28 , and _ hard momenta _ , @xmath29 .",
    "the new integrals that appear from this procedure are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the reduction to the set of master integrals proceeds with integration - by - parts identities @xcite solved with the laporta algorithm @xcite as implemented in the _ idsolver _ library @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson is treated in two regimes . for low masses",
    "we expand in the mass difference between @xmath1 and @xmath24 , with the expansion parameter defined to be    @xmath30    where this time , no thresholds are encountered . to guarantee a reasonable precision ,",
    "we compute six terms in the combined expansion in @xmath26 and @xmath31 . for the second regime , which is the region where @xmath32",
    ", we apply the large mass expansion , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the resulting single scale master integrals are treated with various methods , usually with two or three different ones for test purposes .",
    "most can be obtained with numerical integration , using dispersion relations ( see method ii in @xcite ) . for diagrams of simpler topologies",
    "we use differential equations @xcite and large mass expansions , whereas for more complicated ones we used the mb package @xcite implementing mellin - barnes methods @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "whenever possible we performed cross checks with sector decomposition , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a final , algebraic check of all the procedures is the cancellation of the dependence on the gauge parameter , which we verified for the first orders of the expansion .",
    "the different electroweak contributions to @xmath21 are shown in tab .  [",
    "tab : resultsmwfixed ] , under the assumption that the @xmath7 boson mass is fixed at its experimental value given in tab .",
    "[ input ] together with the remaining input parameters .",
    "note that @xmath33 denotes the two - loop contribution of the fermionic diagrams known from @xcite , whereas @xmath34 is our new result , namely the two - loop contribution of the bosonic diagrams .",
    "the complete prediction , @xmath21 , contains additionally other known corrections .",
    "in particular , the following have been taken into account ( see also @xcite ) : one - loop electroweak corrections , qcd corrections to the one - loop prediction at the two- @xcite and three - loop level @xcite , @xmath35 and @xmath36 corrections to @xmath37 @xcite , as well as leading reducible effects at @xmath38 and @xmath13 .",
    "the exact @xmath1 dependence of the two - loop contributions to @xmath0 , obtained from @xmath21 by rescaling with @xmath39 , can also be read off from fig .",
    "[ cntbs2lew ] , which makes it even more apparent that both fermionic and bosonic corrections are of the same order for low to moderate higgs boson masses .",
    ".higgs boson mass dependence of @xmath40 evaluated with a fixed w boson mass as in tab .  [ input ] .",
    "the normalization factor is @xmath41 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : comparison ]",
    "our calculation shows that the last piece of the two - loop electroweak corrections to the effective weak mixing angle , the one coming from purely bosonic diagrams , gives a very small contribution .",
    "in fact , being of the order of a few times @xmath42 , it is below the anticipated precision of the linear collider , not even to mention the current experimental accuracy .",
    "this strengthens the validity of our fitting formula @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the recent calculation of the @xmath43 corrections to the rho parameter @xcite , has also given a very small contribution , the results of @xcite implemented in zfitter @xcite still provide a reliable prediction for @xmath0 under consideration of all new results .",
    "we estimate the error from unkown higher order corrections on @xmath0 as described in @xcite , including contributions for the next missing loop orders , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath44 , @xmath14 , @xmath45 .",
    "we accidentally mentioned a number for the @xmath46 contributions , but did not include it in the combined error .",
    "] we find a total theoretical error of @xmath5 , which should be taken as a very conservative error estimate , which makes it however necessary to determine further missing corrections if we want to obtain a result at the level needed by a future linear collider .",
