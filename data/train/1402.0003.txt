    "one of the most controversial questions regarding the formation and evolution of galaxies is when and how today s most massive galaxies formed . in the standard paradigm of structure formation ,",
    "dark matter halos build in a hierarchical fashion through the dissipationless mechanism of gravitational instability , while galaxies form inside these structures following the radiative cooling of baryons , with stars forming out of gas that cools within the halos . in this picture ,",
    "the most massive galaxies are naturally at the endpoint of the hierarchical merging process , and offer an opportunity to constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution , since their predicted galaxy properties are sensitive to various model assumptions , such as gas cooling , star formation , stellar and agn feedback processes , chemical evolution , and mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .    in the local universe ( @xmath19 ) , the most massive galaxies ( i.e. , stellar mass @xmath20  m@xmath12 ) constitute a homogeneous population .",
    "these local ultra - massive galaxies tend to live in high - density environments ( typically rich groups or clusters of galaxies ; e.g. , @xcite for a review ) and are characterized by early - type morphologies , red rest - frame optical colors , extremely quiescent stellar populations , old mean stellar ages , significant enhancements of the @xmath21 element ratio , and little dust attenuation , and populate the extreme massive end of the very tight red sequence ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", two decades of archeological studies ( i.e. , the detailed investigation of the stellar populations in local galaxies to constrain their formations and evolutions with cosmic time ) have robustly shown that the more massive the galaxy is today , the earlier its star formation must have started and more promptly must have subsided , in an apparently `` anti - hierarchical '' fashion of the star formation .",
    "quantitatively , most of the stars in local ultra - massive galaxies must have formed in the first @xmath22  gyr of cosmic history ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) through short ( @xmath241  gyr , as low as @xmath25  gyr for the most massive galaxies ) , hence intense , bursts of star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "increasingly more sophisticated models of galaxy formation and evolution have shown that the apparent down - sizing in the star formation of ultra - massive galaxies is not in contradiction with the hierarchical paradigm .",
    "recent models do predict ` anti - hierarchical ' star - formation histories for the most massive galaxies in a @xmath26cdm universe ( with most stars formed by @xmath27 ) , whereas the assembly of these galaxies is indeed hierarchical , with @xmath1480% of the final mass typically locked up in a single galaxy only at @xmath28 and with a number of effective progenitors as high as @xmath145 for the most massive galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these predictions are qualitatively in agreement with the nearly constant rest - frame optical luminosity density of red - sequence galaxies since @xmath29 found by the combo-17 and the deep2 surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this result in fact implies that the stellar mass density in red - sequence galaxies has roughly doubled since @xmath29 driven by a combination of galaxy merging and truncation of star formation of the blue star - forming population . in particular , @xcite have used these results in support of a scenario for the formation of massive red - sequence ( spheroidal ) galaxies involving early mass assembly and star formation ( with such progenitors living on the blue cloud ) , followed by quenching ( which migrates the progenitors onto the red sequence ) and further dry merging ( allowing for additional growth along the red sequence to explain the assembly of the most massive galaxies in the local universe ) .",
    "however , an independent analysis by @xcite of the evolution of the rest - frame optical luminosity function of red - sequence galaxies since @xmath30 from combo-17 and deep2 has shown that the massive ( @xmath31  m@xmath12 ) red - sequence galaxies have actually not grown in mass over the past @xmath147 billion years , while the inferred growth by a factor of @xmath142 of the stellar mass density of red - sequence galaxies since @xmath30 appears due to the build - up of the less - massive red - sequence population .",
    "in addition to the anti - hierarchical formation of the stars , this result implies also an anti - hierarchical assembly of the stellar content of the most massive galaxies , in contrast to the predictions from theoretical models .",
    "recent measurements of the stellar mass function of galaxies out to redshift @xmath32 have intensified the tension between observations and theoretical predictions . indeed ,",
    "increasingly wider and deeper near - infrared surveys have provided evidence for the existence of very massive galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) when the universe was only 1.5 gyr old ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) , and of their number densities evolving very little in the following @xmath1434  gyr from @xmath32 to @xmath3511.5 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "while the stellar mass function of galaxies provides a mean to measure the abundance of a galaxy population at a given time and the overall growth as a function of time of its stellar content , it does not tell us how individual galaxies have evolved and assembled their mass .",
    "ultimately , we would like to be able to connect local ultra - massive galaxies with their progenitors in the early universe to understand how their stellar populations have actually changed over cosmic time and to answer the following outstanding questions .",
    "do local ultra - massive galaxies really form in short and intense bursts of star formation at high redshift ?",
    "when do they actually stop forming stars ?",
    "how does their stellar population age ?",
    "how much mass is assembled over time ?",
    "do they really evolve from the blue cloud to the red sequence as suggested by , e.g. , @xcite ?",
    "needless to say , answering these questions have proved difficult , as it requires the non - trivial task of linking galaxies and their descendants / progenitors through cosmic time , which in turn requires assumptions for how galaxies evolve . however",
    ", in recent years , several approaches have been developed to link galaxies across cosmic time .",
    "a popular approach easy to implement is to compare galaxy properties at fixed cumulative number density ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while this approach has the advantage of relying solely on observations , it does not take into account galaxy - galaxy mergers and scatter in mass accretion histories , both affecting the median cumulative number density of a galaxy population ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more advanced comparisons have adopted either semi - analytical or semi - empirical galaxy - halo connections to deduce galaxy evolution from simulated dark matter merger histories ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the evolution with cosmic time of the progenitors of local ultra - massive ( @xmath36 m@xmath12 ) galaxies from @xmath0 .",
    "the progenitors are selected using both the fixed cumulative number density technique and a semi - empirical approach using abundance matching in the @xmath26cdm paradigm .",
    "the stellar population properties of the progenitors are then studied as a function of redshift .",
    "this analysis provides a direct test of the star - formation histories predicted from the archeology studies of local ultra - massive galaxies and returns a clear and consistent picture of their evolution in the past 11.4 billion years of cosmic history .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : the adopted dataset and the selection of the sample of progenitors are described in  [ sec - dataset ] and  [ sec - sample ] , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the properties of the progenitors of local ultra - massive galaxies is presented in  [ sec - results ] , while the results are summarized and discussed in ",
    "[ sec - discussion ] .",
    "we assume @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39  km  s@xmath15mpc@xmath15 . a @xcite initial mass function ( imf )",
    "is assumed throughout the paper .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "this study uses the k@xmath40-selected catalog of the cosmos / ultravista field from @xcite .",
    "the catalog includes psf - matched photometry in 30 photometric bands over the wavelength range 0.15@xmath41 m @xmath42 24@xmath41 m from the available galex @xcite , cfht / subaru @xcite , ultravista @xcite , and s - cosmos @xcite datasets .",
    "sources are selected from the dr1 ultravista k@xmath40-band imaging @xcite which reaches a depth of k@xmath43 at 90% completeness .",
    "a detailed description of the photometric catalog construction , photometric redshift measurements , and stellar population properties estimates ( e.g. , stellar mass ) is presented in @xcite , which accompanies the public release of all data products from the catalog . a brief description of the relevant aspects of the catalog with respect to our analysis is also provided in @xcite , presenting the measurements of the stellar mass function of galaxies , including quiescent and star - forming galaxies , from @xmath32 to @xmath44 .",
    "briefly , stellar population properties were derived by fitting the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from the _ galex _ uv to the _ spitzer_-irac 8@xmath41 m photometry with @xcite models assuming exponentially - declining star - formation histories ( sfhs ) of the form sfr@xmath45 , where sfr is the star formation rate , @xmath46 is the time since the onset of star formation , and @xmath47 sets the timescale of the decline in the sfr , solar metallicity , a @xcite dust law , and a @xcite imf .",
    "we allow @xmath48 to range between 7.0 and 10.0 gyr , @xmath49 between 7.0 and 10.1 gyr , and @xmath50 between 0 and 4 mag .",
    "median random errors on stellar mass , sfr , stellar age , and dust extinction are @xmath51  dex , @xmath520.2  dex , @xmath53  dex , and @xmath54  mag , respectively , for the quiescent progenitors , and @xmath55  dex , @xmath520.6  dex , @xmath56  dex , and @xmath57 mag , respectively , for the star - forming progenitors , similar to the typical uncertainties from low - resolution spectroscopy @xcite . to assess the systematic effects of the adopted sed - modeling assumptions , we have also investigated different sfhs , metallicities , and extinction curves ( see  [ s - sedmodel ] ) .",
    "the sfrs from sed modeling can be strongly influenced by the assumption of the sfh .",
    "a more robust estimate of the instantaneous sfr is obtained from the combination of the rest - frame uv flux ( @xmath58 ) and the rest - frame total infrared luminosity ( @xmath59 ) . to determine @xmath58 we used eazy @xcite to integrate the best - fit template over the wavelength range 2600 - 2950 .",
    "the inclusion of the _ galex _ photometry in the ultravista multiwavelength catalogs of @xcite guarantees that @xmath58 is constrained by the data over the full targeted redshift range .",
    "the approach presented in @xcite was followed to determine @xmath59 from the 24@xmath41 m emission . specifically , as already described in detail in @xcite",
    ", we used the infrared seds of star - forming galaxies from @xcite , which allow us to derive the ir / mir flux ratio for different heating levels of the interstellar environment , parameterized by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the dust mass heated by an intensity @xmath62 of the interstellar field .",
    "the total infrared luminosity @xmath63 was computed for each template in @xcite within the range @xmath64 .",
    "we adopted the log - average of the resulting @xmath65 as the best estimate for the ir luminosity .",
    "this approach returns sfrs in better agreement with the sfrs estimated from sed modeling ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and from dust - corrected h@xmath66 line fluxes ( @xcite ) , compared to the often adopted local luminosity - dependent approaches , which systematically overestimate sfrs by a factor of 4 - 6 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we convert the @xmath58 into sfr@xmath67 using the conversion factor sfr@xmath68 from @xcite , adapted to a @xcite imf by @xcite .",
    "sfr@xmath67 is the observed sfr , and is not corrected for dust extinction .",
    "the @xmath59 is converted into a sfr@xmath69 using sfr@xmath70 from @xcite , adapted to a @xcite imf .",
    "the total sfr of the galaxies is then derived via sfr@xmath71=sfr@xmath72sfr@xmath69 .",
    "following previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we connect progenitor galaxies by requiring that they have the same cumulative co - moving number density of the low - redshift galaxy population , i.e. , galaxies at @xmath73 with @xmath74 m@xmath12 .",
    "effectively , galaxies are ranked according to their stellar mass and we select galaxies at different redshifts that have the same rank order as the low - redshift population .",
    "the implicit assumption is that rank order is conserved through cosmic time , or that processes that break the rank order do not have a strong effect on the average measured properties .    in order to apply the fixed cumulative number density selection ,",
    "we derive cumulative number densities , @xmath75 , as a function of stellar mass using the recently published and publicly available stellar mass functions from the ultravista survey @xcite .",
    "the contributions from poisson errors , cosmic variance , and photometric redshift uncertainties to the total error budget of the stellar mass functions were quantified and presented in @xcite .",
    "we refer to this paper for a detailed description of the derivations of the errors of the stellar mass functions .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows @xmath75 in the six targeted redshift ranges from @xmath44 to @xmath76 , namely @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "also shown is the total 1@xmath83 error ( including poisson errors , cosmic variance , and photometric redshift uncertainties ) on @xmath75 for the lowest and highest targeted redshift bins .",
    "galaxies with stellar masses @xmath84  m@xmath85 m@xmath12 at @xmath86 have a cumulative number density of @xmath87 mpc@xmath88 ( shown by the horizontal dashed line in the left panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we then trace the progenitors of these galaxies by identifying , at each redshift , the stellar mass for which the cumulative number density is @xmath87 mpc@xmath88 ( indicated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by the filled triangles ) .",
    "the stellar mass evolution for galaxies with the rank order of the low-@xmath89 population is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] with colored filled triangles .",
    "also shown is the formal 1@xmath83 uncertainty on the stellar mass of the progenitors at the given cumulative number density and including the contributions from poisson errors , cosmic variance , and photometric redshift uncertainties . as previously done in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we parameterize the evolution of the stellar mass of the progenitors with a quadratic function of the form @xmath90 , with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 ( dashed curve in the right panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , corresponding to a value of the stellar mass in the local universe of @xmath94 .",
    "this value is comparable to the typical stellar masses of local brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fixed cumulative number density approach does not take into account galaxy - galaxy mergers and scatter in mass accretion histories , both altering the median cumulative number density of a galaxy population ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , to select the progenitors we also adopt a semi - empirical approach using abundance matching in the @xmath26cdm paradigm , accounting for mergers and scatter in mass accretion histories .",
    "a detailed description of this technique is presented in @xcite ( and references therein ) , who also made publicly available the code implementing this technique .",
    "briefly , the galaxy cumulative number density at redshift @xmath95 is converted to a halo mass with equal cumulative number density using peak halo mass functions .",
    "then , for halos at that mass at @xmath95 , the masses of the most - massive progenitor halos at @xmath96 are recorded using to the halos mass accretion histories .",
    "finally , the median halo progenitor mass at @xmath97 is converted back into cumulative number densities using the halo mass function at @xmath97 .",
    "similarly to the fixed cumulative number density approach , the progenitors of the low-@xmath89 population of very massive galaxies are traced by identifying , at each redshift , the stellar mass for which the evolving cumulative number density ( determined with the semi - empirical approach using abundance matching ) intersects the cumulative number density curves derived from the ultravista stellar mass functions ( plotted as filled circles in the left panel fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    the resulting stellar mass evolution with the corresponding 1@xmath83 uncertainty is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] with colored filled circles .",
    "errors on the stellar mass of the progenitors were derived in the same way as described in  [ fcnda ] . adopting the same parameterization as for the fixed cumulative number density approach , we find @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , also implying a value of the stellar mass in the local universe of @xmath94 ( continuous curve in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "here we study and present the evolution as a function of cosmic time of the properties of the progenitors of local ultra - massive ( @xmath101 ) galaxies ( umgs , hereafter ) since @xmath0 . for a given redshift , we select the progenitors of @xmath19 umgs within a bin of size @xmath25  dex in stellar mass centered on @xmath102 , following the approach adopted by @xcite .",
    "the actual boundaries of the bins are adjusted such that the median mass is close to the value given by @xmath102 . given the steepness of the stellar mass function , in practice this results in selecting galaxies at @xmath103 .",
    "as shown by the dashed curve in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , the evolution in stellar mass of the progenitors of @xmath19 umgs is quite small when the progenitors are selected using the fixed cumulative number density method , i.e. , @xmath104  dex ( i.e. , a factor of @xmath142.1@xmath105 ) from @xmath76 to @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , about half of the stellar mass in local umgs was assembled at @xmath106 , i.e. , in the first 2  gyr of cosmic history .",
    "if the progenitors are instead selected with the semi - empirical approach using abundance matching , the evolution in stellar mass is much more significant , @xmath107  dex , @xmath108  dex , and @xmath109  dex from @xmath76 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , respectively , to @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the progenitors have grown by a factor of @xmath143.6@xmath112 over the last 11.4  gyr from @xmath76 to @xmath2 , with only about a fourth of the stellar mass in local umgs having been assembled by @xmath27 .",
    "if the 68th - percentile range in stellar mass ( shown in figure  [ fig1 ] as a light gray filled region ) resulting from the scatter in the progenitors number density is included in the error budget , the uncertainty on the inferred growth would be larger by a factor up to @xmath141.7 , i.e. , @xmath113  dex , @xmath114 dex , and @xmath115  dex from @xmath76 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , respectively , to @xmath2 .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] also shows the predicted median and 15@xmath116/85@xmath116 percentiles of the ` formation ' ( light blue ) and ` assembly ' ( light green ) histories of bcgs from the theoretical study using semi - analytic techniques presented in @xcite .",
    "the formation history of bcgs is defined as the sum of the stellar masses in all progenitors at each time , whereas their assembly history corresponds to the stellar mass of the main branch . as highlighted in @xcite",
    ", there is a very small scatter in the formation histories of bcgs , with most of their stars having formed at @xmath1173 ( @xmath1490% of the stars formed at @xmath118 ) .",
    "the assembly histories exhibit a much larger scatter with a much later assembly time .",
    "specifically , the fraction of mass in the main progenitor varies between 15% and 40% at @xmath7 , and between 40% and 70% at @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the inferred evolutions in stellar mass of the progenitors of @xmath19 umgs ( solid or dashed curves ) are faster than the model - predicted assembly histories , but much slower than the predicted formation histories of bcgs . in other words , in semi - analytic models most of the stars were not formed in the main branch , but star formation happened very early in low- to intermediate - mass halos ( with stellar masses @xmath14a few @xmath12010@xmath121  m@xmath12 ) , which were accreted steadily over time following the assembly history of the dark matter .",
    "we note that , as the median cumulative number density of the progenitors increases with redshift as @xmath122 @xcite , using the fixed cumulative number density approach would preferentially select progenitors which potentially had an unusually rapid assembly at earlier times .",
    "this should be kept in mind in the comparison between the model - predicted assembly history of bcgs with the inferred growth in stellar mass of the progenitors of local umgs selected with the fixed cumulative number density approach . at @xmath0 ,",
    "the progenitors of umgs have a typical observed stellar mass of @xmath123 , a factor of @xmath124 larger than the model - predicted stellar mass assembled by @xmath0 , implying a predicted abundance of bcgs progenitors at @xmath0 significantly larger than observed .",
    "we note that the dominant source of uncertainty in the stellar mass evolution of the progenitors is due to the scatter in the progenitors cumulative number density . when this source of error is included , as shown by the light gray filled region in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , the disagreement between the observed stellar growth of local umgs and the model - predicted assembly history of bcgs becomes less significant , and the two marginally agree at the @xmath142@xmath83 level .",
    "the disagreement between observed and model - predicted evolutions of the stellar mass content of the progenitors of local umgs is another manifestation of the previously highlighted tensions between observed and model - predicted stellar mass functions .",
    "specifically , semi - analytic models were found to significantly overpredict the observed number density of galaxies below @xmath125  m@xmath12 at @xmath126 - 1.5 and to underpredict the number density of massive galaxies at @xmath23 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with low - mass galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath127  m@xmath12 forming too early in the models and being too passive at later times ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note that , whereas the typical errors on stellar masses are not large enough to explain the disagreement at the high - mass end between the observed and the model - predicted stellar mass functions at @xmath128 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the disagreement between the inferred evolution in stellar mass of the progenitors of local umgs and the model - predicted assembly history of bcgs shown in figure  [ fig1 ] could potentially be further reduced ( although at most only partly ) if the model predictions were to be convolved by the typical statistical errors in the stellar masses of ultravista .    whereas the inferred growth in stellar mass from @xmath0 is quite different depending on the adopted method to select the progenitors , the derived evolution in the stellar population parameters ( e.g. , rest - frame colors , level of star formation activity , stellar ages , extinction , rest - frame optical absolute magnitudes , and mass - to - light ratios ) is qualitatively similar .",
    "moreover , observationally , recent works have robustly revealed that most early - type galaxies show tidally disrupted features indicative of their past merging histories ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with evidence of major dry ( i.e. , dissipationless ) merging being an increasingly important mechanism for the evolution of galaxies with @xmath129  m@xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "contrary to the fixed cumulative number density method , the semi - empirical approach using abundance matching accounts for mergers , making the latter a more desirable approach to constrain the evolution of the median cumulative number density for a galaxy population @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the sections below , we present only the evolution of the stellar population properties of the progenitors of @xmath19 umgs when selected with the semi - empirical approach using abundance matching . for completeness ,",
    "appendix  [ appendixa ] presents the evolution of the stellar population properties of the progenitors of local umgs when selected with the fixed cumulative number density method .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath130 versus @xmath131 color - color diagram ( hereafter the @xmath132 diagram ) has become , in recent years , a common tool to separate quiescent from star - forming galaxies for its ability to separate red galaxies that are quiescent from reddened ( i.e. , dust obscured ) star - forming galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the evolution of the rest - frame @xmath130 and @xmath131 colors of the progenitors of umgs since @xmath0 ( colored filled circles ) , along with the evolution of the rest - frame @xmath130 and @xmath131 colors of the overall galaxy population ( grayscale representation ) above the 95% mass - completeness limit from the ultravista survey . to distinguish between star - forming and quiescent galaxies we use the same box adopted in @xcite for the study of the evolution of the stellar mass functions of star - forming and quiescent galaxies since @xmath32 .",
    "the adopted box is plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] , with the quiescent and star - forming progenitors highlighted in red and blue , respectively .",
    "color evolution tracks from the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite are also plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] for different assumed star - formation histories ( sfhs ) and amount of dust extinction : an exponentially declining sfh with an e - folding timescale of @xmath47=100  myr and no dust extinction ( @xmath133 ; dark gray track ) , a constant sfh with no dust ( csf ; light blue ) , and the same csf model with @xmath134  mag of extinction ( light brown ) .",
    "the color tracks are plotted up to the maximum allowed age of the universe corresponding to the lower limit of each redshift interval .",
    "we note that the @xmath133 color track is very similar to the color track of a single stellar population , with the latter reaching the same @xmath130 and @xmath131 colors of the @xmath133 model at slightly younger ( by @xmath25  gyr ) ages .    at @xmath73 ,",
    "the progenitors of umgs constitute a homogeneous population with similar rest - frame @xmath130 and @xmath131 colors , typical of quiescent galaxies with old ( age@xmath135  gyr ) stellar populations ( from the comparison with the @xmath133 color track ) .",
    "as the progenitors of umgs are followed to higher redshifts , such population becomes increasingly diversified . out to @xmath7 ,",
    "the progenitors are still all quiescent galaxies and constitute a homogeneous population , while at @xmath9 the contribution from star - forming galaxies progressively increases , with the population of the progenitors being dominated by star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "quantitatively , the fraction of quiescent galaxies in the progenitors of local umgs is seen to decrease from 100% at @xmath136 , to @xmath1486% at @xmath18 , and down to @xmath1417% by @xmath16 .",
    "the location of the star - forming progenitors in the @xmath132 diagram clearly indicates that these galaxies are quite dusty , with typical extinction in the visual band of @xmath137  mag ( inferred from the comparison with the color track of a csf model with @xmath134  mag ) .",
    "the dusty nature of the star - forming progenitors can be further tested with _ spitzer_-mips 24@xmath41 m data . for the targeted redshift range ,",
    "the mips  24@xmath41 m probes the rest - frame mid - infrared ( mir ; @xmath146 and 20@xmath41 m at @xmath0 and @xmath44 , respectively ) , offering a powerful method of separating two basic sed types : evolved quiescent systems ( whose stellar emission drops drastically at @xmath1382@xmath41 m ) , and active dusty galaxies , i.e. , those that are powered by either star formation or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , both of which produce substantial mir emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , in pure starburst galaxies , the mir emission is dominated by features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) that are strong relative to the underlying dust continuum , which only begins to rise above @xmath139@xmath41 m @xcite .",
    "the hard radiation field of an agn destroys pah carriers , and the continuum emission from hot small dust grains is strong throughout the mir @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of umgs detected with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath140 in the mips 24@xmath41 m data are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] by green filled circles .",
    "on average , @xmath1484% of the star - forming progenitors are robustly detected with @xmath140 in mips , with a fraction of 24@xmath41m - detected sources as high as 90% at @xmath141 , supporting the dusty nature of the star - forming progenitors .",
    "we note that the adopted mips flux limit ( 35@xmath41jy , 5@xmath83 ) translates into a large range of mir luminosities sampled at a broad range of rest - frame wavelengths over the large considered redshift range , preventing the detection rate alone to be an ideal proxy of the level of obscured star - formation activity as a function of redshift , since larger sfrs are needed in order to be detected at higher redshifts .",
    "therefore , the roughly constant detection rate of the star - forming progenitors over the targeted redshift interval is a strong evidence for increasing levels of the dust - enshrouded activity with redshift in the star - forming progenitors of umgs ( see a more quantitative analysis of the evolution of the sfr and specific - sfr in  [ ssfr ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the star - forming progenitors , only @xmath1421% of the quiescent progenitors are on average detected at 24@xmath41 m with @xmath140 , with this fraction ranging from @xmath1436% at @xmath86 to @xmath1412% at @xmath16 .",

    "worth noting is also a significant increase in the spanned ranges of rest - frame @xmath130 and @xmath131 colors toward redder values , especially at @xmath229 , when the new template is included .    despite these differences , the overall evolutionary picture of the progenitors of local umgs does not change at all in , e.g. , the @xmath130 versus @xmath146 diagram ,",
    "hence our main results and conclusions are robust against the inclusion of the `` old and dusty '' template , whose relevance has yet to be confirmed and assessed spectroscopically .",
    "contamination of the photometry from emission lines is another source of systematic effects , potentially resulting in significant overestimated stellar masses .",
    "several recent spectroscopic investigations have shown serious systematic effects due to emission lines on the derived stellar masses of rest - frame uv selected , star - forming galaxies at @xmath227 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have used the best - fit eazy template to quantify the impact of emission lines on the estimated stellar masses .",
    "specifically , the eazy templates used to derive photometric redshifts include emission lines , and we have measured emission lines equivalent widths on the best - fit eazy templates of the progenitors sample .",
    "then , we used the measured equivalent widths to correct the observed seds , and we re - estimated stellar masses using the emission lines corrected seds . this modeling leads to conclude that the majority of the progenitors sample at @xmath198 is not affected significantly by emission line contamination , with a mean difference of 0.03@xmath520.05  dex in the stellar mass estimated before and after emission line correction .",
    "we estimate that @xmath145% of the sample appears to be affected significantly by emission line contamination , with stellar masses overestimated on average by a factor of @xmath142.5 .",
    "since these galaxies represent less than 10% of the sample of star - forming progenitors at @xmath147 , we conclude that , based on the emission line ratios and simplistic modeling adopted in eazy , our results appears to be relatively robust against emission line contamination .    however , we caution that unusually high line ratios , especially [ oiii]/h@xmath230 , are being consistently found in star - forming galaxies at @xmath106 , significantly biasing estimated stellar masses @xcite .",
    "while these studies have been currently targeting only rest - frame uv selected galaxies with smaller stellar masses ( @xmath231 ) compared to our progenitors sample , we stress that a robust quantitative assessment of emission line contamination in the @xmath23 galaxy population at the high - mass end will necessarily require spectroscopic studies for large samples of massive star - forming galaxies , currently missing .",
    "the derived stellar population properties depend on the adopted choice of sed - modeling assumptions .",
    "we have investigated the effects of different sed - modeling assumptions by adopting different sfhs , extinction curves , and metallicities .",
    "specifically , in place of the exponentially - declining sfh we have used a delayed-@xmath47 sfh of the form @xmath232 , which allows for increasing sfr at earlier times . in place of the @xcite extinction curve ,",
    "we have adopted both the milky way extinction law @xcite and the extinction curve proposed by @xcite , which assumes a dust attenuation curve with @xmath233 and a uv dust bump which is 20% of the strength of the milky way bump , following the prescription by @xcite .",
    "finally , we have relaxed the assumption on metallicity by leaving it as a free parameter in the sed modeling .",
    "the systematic effects on the stellar population properties of the progenitor galaxies are found to be significantly smaller than the corresponding typical random uncertainties for most of the different sed - modeling assumptions .",
    "for the stellar mass , the systematic effect is found to be relevant only when adopting the milky way extinction curve , although still comparable to the typical random uncertainty , with @xmath146 smaller by 0.05(0.09 ) dex for the quiescent ( star - forming ) progenitors .",
    "the adoption of the milky way extinction curve also results in the largest systematic effects for the dust extinction , although significantly smaller compared to its typical random uncertainty , with @xmath50 smaller by 0.05(0.2 )  mag for the quiescent ( star - forming ) progenitors compared to the case when the @xcite law is adopted . the largest effect on the star - formation rate for the quiescent progenitors",
    "is found when the delayed-@xmath47 model is adopted , with sfr smaller by 0.1  dex , whereas the largest effect on the star - formation rate for the star - forming progenitors is found when the milky way extinction curve is adopted , with sfr smaller by 0.13  dex .",
    "finally , the largest effects on the stellar ages of the star - forming progenitors are found when the delayed-@xmath47 model is adopted , with @xmath168 larger by @xmath140.1  dex compared to the default sed - modeling assumptions .",
    "the stellar ages of the quiescent progenitors changes at most by 0.02  dex depending on the different sed - modeling assumptions .",
    "we therefore conclude that the inferred evolution with redshift of the stellar population properties of the quiescent and star - forming progenitors of local umgs are robust and not very sensitive to reasonable choices of the sed - modeling assumptions .",
    "however , systematic effects in the modeling of the observed seds , and hence in the estimated stellar masses , can be relevant in galaxies characterized by composite stellar populations .",
    "specifically , the stellar masses of the dusty , massive star - forming progenitors at @xmath147 could be potentially overestimated when modeled with a single stellar population , especially if characterized by multiple stellar population components with differential dust extinctions , such as a quiescent un - obscured population and a young , dusty star - bursting component .    to investigate potential biases in the stellar masses of the star - forming progenitors at @xmath10 ,",
    "we have derived stellar masses by allowing for multiple stellar components to contribute to the observed seds of the dusty star - forming progenitors .",
    "no systematic differences are found , with a median difference smaller than 0.1  dex and a scatter of @xmath140.5  dex ( brammer et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) .",
    "we also note that the observed seds of most of the dusty star - forming progenitors of umgs at @xmath147 can not be well modeled by an ad hoc combination of a quiescent un - obscured population and a young , dusty star - bursting component , which would arguably cause the largest biases in the stellar mass estimates ( brammer et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that , while the stellar masses of individual star - forming progenitors may be systematically different by a factor of a few - to - several due to simplified sed - modeling assumptions , the stellar mass distribution of the overall population appears to be largely unaffected by the adopted sed - modeling assumptions .",
    "nonetheless , we stress that the multi - component modeling in brammer et al .",
    "( 2014 ) is still over simplified ( e.g. , a dust screen with an adopted @xcite extinction curve ) , and systematic errors up to a factor of several in stellar mass can not be excluded for a subset of the most extreme star - forming progenitors .      in this study",
    "we have demonstrated that a significant fraction of the progenitors of umgs at @xmath23 are dusty star - forming galaxies . amongst that population ,",
    "@xmath1419% have extraordinary seds with very red @xmath131 colors ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , effectively zero galaxies with such red @xmath131 colors exist at @xmath8 ( down to the ultravista mass limit ) , and therefore it is tempting to classify them as a `` new '' population of galaxies .",
    "these extremely red galaxies are intriguing , and in figure  [ fig8 ] we show four representative examples of their seds .",
    "the solid lines are the best - fit fast seds using the default sed modeling assumptions .",
    "the fits are reasonable and hence with the default assumptions we naturally interpret this population as massive , extremely red , star - forming progenitors .",
    "however , the seds are quite unlike local galaxies , and given that they only appear at @xmath9 , it is important to consider carefully what else this unusual population might be and how accurate their stellar masses are . as already discussed , systematic effects likely dominate the uncertainties in both the photometric redshifts and sed modeling of individual galaxies among this extreme population .",
    "specifically , strong emission lines ( or unusual emission - line ratios ) could result in significantly overestimated stellar masses , while the presence of optically thick regions could even cause the underestimating of their stellar masses .",
    "perhaps of most concern are composite stellar populations and/or potential blending / confusion of sources in ground - based images which could result in the unusual seds and therefore biased stellar masses .    without additional data",
    "it is difficult to say how reasonable the sed modeling assumptions are for this population , and how reliable their stellar masses are .",
    "therefore , currently we advise caution in interpreting this extreme population . while they are only @xmath1419% of the overall population , and unlikely to change our overall picture of umg formation , they are intriguing , and detailed investigations , beyond the capabilities of current photometric catalogs , will be needed to confirm the existence of this population , and to assess its relevance in the formation of massive galaxies in the early universe .",
    "we note that a better understanding of this population could be made with current instrumentation .",
    "spectroscopy from ground - based near - infrared spectrographs and alma could measure spectroscopic redshifts and clearly identify the level of contamination of the broad band colors from emission lines ( if any ) .",
    "likewise , _",
    "hubble space telescope _ near - infrared observations could resolve them spatially and be used to test for confusion / blending , as well as potential systematics from resolved composite stellar populations .",
    "lastly , deep spectroscopy could be used to determine velocity dispersions , which will be the key for understanding how reliable the photometrically - derived masses are .",
    "followup of this extreme population will be key for a more complete understanding of the evolutionary history of umgs .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the evolution since @xmath0 of the properties of the progenitors of ultra - massive galaxies ( @xmath1 ) at @xmath2 ( umgs ) .",
    "the progenitors have been selected using the fixed cumulative number density approach and a semi - empirical method using abundance matching in the @xmath26cdm paradigm .",
    "when the progenitors are selected with the fixed cumulative number density approach , the stellar mass of the progenitors is seen to grow by a factor of @xmath235 from @xmath0 to @xmath2 , implying that about half of the stellar mass in local umgs was assembled at @xmath106 .",
    "if the progenitors are selected with the semi - empirical method using abundance matching , the evolution in stellar mass is much more significant ( @xmath113  dex ) , with only about a fourth of the stellar mass in local umgs having been assembled by @xmath0 . since the semi - empirical approach using abundance matching accounts for merging , whereas the fixed cumulative number density method does not , the former is a more desirable and robust approach to constrain the evolution of the median cumulative number density and therefore to select progenitors .",
    "the comparison between the assembly history of local brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) as predicted from semi - analytic models with the inferred evolution in stellar mass since @xmath0 of the progenitors of local umgs provides yet another manifestation of the previously highlighted tensions between the observed and model - predicted evolutions of the stellar mass function since @xmath32 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , low - mass galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath127  m@xmath12 form too early in the models and are too passive at later times @xcite , with the mass growth of simulated bcgs being dominated by accretion since @xmath236 @xcite , in contrast to what is measured in our study .    the progenitors of umgs have been separated in quiescent and star - forming galaxies using the rest - frame @xmath130 versus @xmath131 diagram ( @xmath132 diagram ) . at @xmath86 , the progenitors of umgs constitute a homogeneous population with similar rest - frame @xmath130 and @xmath131 colors , typical of quiescent galaxies with old stellar populations ( age@xmath147  gyr ) . as the progenitors are followed to higher redshifts , this population becomes increasingly diversified . at @xmath8 ,",
    "the progenitors are all quiescent , while at @xmath9 the contribution from star - forming galaxies progressively increases , with the progenitors population being dominated by dusty , star - bursting galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "the stellar population properties ( i.e. , stellar age , dust extinction , star - formation rate , specific star - formation rate , rest - frame absolute @xmath203-band magnitude , and mass - to - light ratio in the rest - frame @xmath203 band ) have been estimated from the modeling of the uv - to-8@xmath41 m spectral energy distributions and 24@xmath41 m data , and their evolutions with redshift have been investigated . at @xmath16 ,",
    "most of the progenitors of umgs are dusty ( @xmath131 - 2.2  mag ) star - bursting ( sfr@xmath14100 - 700  m@xmath12  yr@xmath15 ; ssfr@xmath140.8 - 4  gyr@xmath15 ) galaxies with a large range in stellar ages , i.e. , 0.3 - 1.6  gyr . at the same redshift ,",
    "the quiescent progenitors have properties typical of young ( age @xmath140.6 - 1 gyr ) post - starburst galaxies with little dust extinction ( @xmath130.4 mag ) and strong balmer breaks , showing a large scatter in rest - frame @xmath130 color ( @xmath140.2 mag ) . with decreasing redshift",
    ", the fraction of quiescent progenitors increases as the star - forming progenitors quench to build the quiescent population . at the same time , the stellar population of the already quiescent progenitors is clearly seen to age with cosmic time , with their properties changing accordingly .",
    "specifically , their stellar ages and mass - to - light ratio increase with decreasing redshift , and their median seds evolve from being characterized by a strong balmer break to being shaped by the 4000  break in the rest - frame optical .",
    "moreover , the quiescent progenitors are seen to migrate from the bottom - left to the upper - right corner of the @xmath132 quiescent box and their rest - frame @xmath130 color to redden , as expected from an aging quiescent stellar population .",
    "it is interesting to note that the stellar properties of the star - forming progenitors do not appear to be changing substantially over the redshift interval @xmath237 , and that over this same interval the scatter in the @xmath130 color of the quiescent progenitors remains constant and large ( @xmath140.17  mag ) and it starts to decrease only at @xmath238 .",
    "it appears indeed that @xmath165 marks the time by which most of the star - forming progenitors have quenched , as indicated by the very few star - forming progenitors at @xmath186 . consistent with this interpretation , the last star - forming progenitors to quench at @xmath18 are characterized by lower levels of star formation and older ages on average compared to the star - forming progenitors at @xmath147 .",
    "by @xmath7 , all star - forming progenitors have quenched , and the quiescent progenitors are simply left aging thereafter in the following @xmath147.7  gyr to @xmath2 , and some additional growing due to , e.g. , minor dry mergers .    whereas the existence at @xmath16 of a small fraction ( @xmath1415% ) of quiescent progenitors implies that the assembly of the very massive end of the local quiescent red - sequence population must have started at @xmath106 , our results suggest it had been mostly assembled between @xmath0 and @xmath165 , with all the growth by in - situ star formation ceased by @xmath7 .",
    "most of the quenching of the star - forming progenitors is seen to happen between @xmath16 and @xmath18 , implying a mean age difference of @xmath142.6  gyr among the umgs .",
    "our results are in remarkably good agreement with the typical formation redshift of quiescent , red - sequence umgs in the local universe ( @xmath239 ) and their rms scatter in age ( @xmath1831.8 - 2  gyr ) as derived from archeological studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and provide a direct probe in the early universe of the results and implications of the fossil records in the population of umgs today .",
    "finally , we have shown that the progenitors of umgs have never lived on the blue star - forming cloud in the last 11.4  gyr of cosmic history , i.e. , since @xmath0 .",
    "this is true also for the star - forming progenitors , which have a median rest - frame @xmath130 color at @xmath16 similar to the quiescent progenitors , with a significant fraction of them having @xmath130 colors much redder than most of the quiescent progenitors at the same redshift . in light of our findings",
    ", the picture in which early - type umgs at @xmath19 have formed from star - forming galaxies living on the blue cloud that reddened after quenching and further grew through moderate dry merging has to be refined .",
    "such scenario is pictured in figure  [ fig9 ] as taken from the `` evolution track c '' in @xcite .",
    "this scenario involves early mass assembly and star formation in galaxies on the blue cloud of star - forming galaxies .",
    "when the star - formation activity in the blue galaxies gets quenched , they rapidly move onto the red sequence .",
    "once on the red sequence of quiescent galaxies , any further growth in stellar mass in these progenitors mostly proceeds via dry merging among galaxies on the red sequence . whereas such path is still viable to explain the formation of less massive ( e.g. , @xmath125",
    "m@xmath12 ) local red - sequence galaxies which may have gone through mostly unobscured ( hence blue ) episodes of early star formation , our study suggest an alternative path for the formation of umgs at @xmath19 .",
    "this new scenario , pictured as a green arrow in figure  [ fig9 ] , involves early mass assembly and stellar growth in a short and intense dusty burst of star formation during which the progenitors manifest as a red , heavily dust - obscured star - bursting galaxies .",
    "after quenching , the progenitors continue reddening due to the aging of their stellar populations , and eventually grow in mass through ( mostly minor ) dry merging , finally reaching their current positions on the color - mass diagram .",
    "this scenario qualitatively agrees with the predictions from the theoretical model of the co - evolution of massive galaxies and super - massive black holes originally proposed in @xcite and further developed in @xcite and @xcite , which indicates that the star formation in the progenitors of local very massive spheroids proceeded within a heavily dust - enshrouded medium at @xmath147 over a timescale @xmath240  gyr .",
    "our study provides a complete and consistent picture of how the most massive galaxies in the local universe have formed and assembled since @xmath0 .",
    "while we see the star - forming progenitors disappearing and turning into the quiescent progenitors , we do not know what physical mechanisms are responsible for halting the star formation .",
    "is the agn , if present , playing a major role ?",
    "what about feedback from the starburst itself ?",
    "for the first time , our analysis provides a sample of star - forming progenitors that must quench by @xmath7 .",
    "detailed studies of the agn content , physical conditions of the gas ( e.g. , gas fraction and gas - phase metallicity ) , stellar population properties ( e.g. , stellar ages and metallicities , sfrs ) , structural and dynamical properties , and environment of these star - forming progenitors can shed light into the physical processes responsible for the inevitable quenching of their star - formation activity .",
    "high @xmath241 optical and near - infrared spectroscopic studies , as well as deep sub - millimeter studies with alma will provide the datasets to answer the remaining outstanding questions .",
    "needless to say , our study needs to be extended to earlier times to investigate the properties of the progenitors at @xmath106 , i.e. , in the first 2 billion years of cosmic history .",
    "have the progenitors ever lived on the blue star - forming cloud ? which are the progenitors of the quiescent , massive , post - starburst galaxies we see at @xmath242 ?",
    "much deeper near - infrared selected catalogs over a large surveyed area are required to push this investigation to higher redshift .",
    "the second data release ( dr2 ) of the ultravista survey will provide much deeper near - infrared coverage over @xmath1470% of the full cosmos field , reaching @xmath243  mag deeper in the @xmath244 band , and allowing to probe the stellar population 0.5  dex deeper in stellar mass .",
    "the observed assembly since @xmath0 of the most massive galaxies need to be investigated in more detail in the context of theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution . the new generation of semi - analytic models accounting for a better treatment of satellite galaxies , for the formation of the intra - cluster component , including detailed chemical enrichment models , and coupled with radiative transfer codes or templates to predict the infrared luminosities of model galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) will provide valuable tools to further test the physical mechanisms driving the formation and evolution of today s most massive galaxies .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath1419% of the star - forming progenitors at @xmath23 have extraordinary seds with very red @xmath131 colors ( @xmath234 ) , potentially representing a `` new '' population of galaxies in the early universe that effectively disappear by @xmath29 .",
    "while unlikely to change our overall picture of the formation of umgs , systematic effects dominate the uncertainties in both the photometric redshifts and sed modeling of individual galaxies among this extreme population .",

    "<S> using the ultravista catalogs , we investigate the evolution in the 11.4  gyr since @xmath0 of the progenitors of local ultra - massive galaxies ( @xmath1 ; umgs ) , providing a complete and consistent picture of how the most massive galaxies at @xmath2 have assembled . by selecting the progenitors with a semi - empirical approach using abundance matching , </S>",
    "<S> we infer a growth in stellar mass of 0.56@xmath3 dex , 0.45@xmath4  dex , and 0.27@xmath5 dex from @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively , to @xmath2 . at @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> the progenitors of umgs constitute a homogeneous population of only quiescent galaxies with old stellar populations . at @xmath9 , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from star - forming galaxies progressively increases , with the progenitors at @xmath10 being dominated by massive ( @xmath11m@xmath12 ) , dusty ( @xmath1312.2 mag ) , star - forming ( sfr@xmath14100400  m@xmath12 yr@xmath15 ) galaxies with a large range in stellar ages . at @xmath16 , @xmath1415% of the progenitors </S>",
    "<S> are quiescent , with properties typical of post - starburst galaxies with little dust extinction and strong balmer break , and showing a large scatter in color . </S>",
    "<S> our findings indicate that at least half of the stellar content of local umgs was assembled at @xmath9 , whereas the remaining was assembled via merging from @xmath17 to the present . </S>",
    "<S> most of the quenching of the star - forming progenitors happened between @xmath16 and @xmath18 , in good agreement with the typical formation redshift and scatter in age of @xmath2 umgs as derived from their fossil records . </S>",
    "<S> the progenitors of local umgs , including the star - forming ones , never lived on the blue cloud since @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an alternative path for the formation of local umgs that refines previously proposed pictures and that is fully consistent with our findings . </S>"
