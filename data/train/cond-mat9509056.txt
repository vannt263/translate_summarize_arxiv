    "characteristic spin glass features are : ( i ) remanence effects in the frozen state@xcite , ( ii ) a pronounced cusp in the susceptibility around @xmath20@xcite with strong frequency dependence of the cusp temperature@xcite , ( iii ) absence of long range spin order as observed by magnetic neutron diffraction@xcite , ( iv ) dynamic scaling near @xmath20 of frequency - dependent response function@xcite and  most importantly  ( v ) a divergent nonlinear susceptibility around the cusp temperature@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the antiferromagnetic correlation length @xmath21 grows continuously with decreasing temperature until it saturates at the cusp temperature to an enormously large value as high as 70  at @xmath19 ; it is only below @xmath22 that short range afm order disappears . in the intermediate dilution range",
    "@xmath23 the spin glass interpretation has been questioned , and it was suggested briefly@xcite ( on the basis of an `` activated '' scaling analysis ) that the equilibrium transition at @xmath20 was to the antiferromagnetically ordered state of a random  field system .",
    "this motivates a numerical study of a diluted antiferromagnet , in which we can observe the interplay of strong afm local order with spin glass order , and can measure the quantities now considered to be the signatures for spin - glass transitions .",

    "in this section , we collect the qualitative expectations for all the different concentration regimes expected in the phase diagram . as with the results in the subsequent sections , we begin by reviewing the pure case and proceed in the direction of greater dilution .",
    "the global phase diagram is qualitatively similar to those conjectured for _ vector _ spins in ref .   and ref .  , except of course that distinctive collinear and noncollinear phases can not exist in the ising case",
    "the pure ising antiferromagnet on a fcc lattice has been extensively studied both analytically and with simulations .",
    "each spin has 12 nearest neighbours which in the ground state can only satisfy 8 bonds , 4 of them being always violated .",
    "this effect of frustration , which follows from the triangles in the fcc lattice , leads to a large ground state degeneracy@xcite of the order @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the linear extent of the system .",
    "thus the entropy per spin is zero as @xmath28 .    at small temperatures in this system ,",
    "thermal fluctuations generate free energy terms which have the same effect as ferromagnetic second neighbor interactions : this favors the `` type  i '' afm order , meaning that the system orders into one of the six periodic ground states with a @xmath29 type ordering wavevector@xcite .",
    "this is an example of what villain called `` ordering due to disorder '' @xcite .",
    "the discrete choice between the three @xmath29 type directions suggests a similarity in behavior to the 3-state potts model , which has a weakly first order phase transition in three dimensions .",
    "indeed , the @xmath30 renormalization group predicts a first - order phase transition@xcite .",
    "simulations @xcite and series expansions@xcite confirm that the phase transition is at finite temperature and is of first order .",
    "the antiferromagnetic state may be handled quantitatively by constructing ( in the spirit of ref .  )",

    "take the case of rather weak dilution , which justifies assuming ( as a sort of variational state ) one of the six @xmath29 type ground states .",
    "consider the effect of strengthening one _ bond _ lying within the @xmath35 plane : it will favor the four states with ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) ordering wavevectors and disfavor the two with ( 001 ) wavevectors , since the bond in question is violated in the ( 001 ) states .",
    "the effect is much like a random field , except that it does not destroy the global up / down symmetry . in our case of _ site _ dilution ,",
    "the random - field - like effects of removing an isolated site cancel each other ; however , removing a _ pair of sites _ has the same effect as would strengthening the bond between them@xcite .    quite generally ,",
    "when the random field is sufficiently strong , the first - order transition is converted to a continuous one@xcite . in the present context , since the effective random field grows with dilution , this argument predicts a tricritical point : the ordering transition is first - order for @xmath36 but becomes continuous for @xmath37@xcite .",
    "for @xmath38 the transition from the paramagnet is expected to be a novel universality class@xcite . it would seem plausible if its dynamic scaling behavior were of the `` activated '' type , as in the random - field ising model .",
    "no experiments have tested this , however ( the materials in this concentration range , roughly @xmath39 , can be grown only as thin epitaxial slabs , meaning that very little signal is available for susceptibility experiments . ) .",
    "a claim was made that `` activated '' scaling could fit the data @xcite for lower values of @xmath40 , which we would identify as the spin - glass phase , but this was quickly corrected@xcite .",
    "when the `` effective random fields '' are sufficiently strong , the antiferromagnetic order disappears and is replaced by spin - glass order at a critical value @xmath41@xcite . note that this threshold to propagate afm order is far above the @xmath42 , the geometrical percolation threshold for propagating connectivity of nearest - neighbor sites@xcite ( on the fcc lattice , @xmath43@xcite . ) .",
    "any spin glass , by definition , requires random frustration .",
    "this can be realized by dilution of a uniformly frustrated antiferromagnet , as in the present case , just as well as by a random mix of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions@xcite .",
    "indeed , the effective coupling between two spins may be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on how intervening sites happen to be occupied .",
    "of course , this spin glass state is expected to show residual short  range correlations as opposed to the cases of the @xmath44 or gaussian random bond distributions , where symmetry implies that @xmath45=0 $ ] if @xmath46 .",
    "it is intriguing that this `` spin glass '' state , which occurs below @xmath41 , from the viewpoint of the antiferromagnetic phase , is the same as the disordered domain state which is favored by the `` effective random fields '' mentioned above@xcite .",
    "this state is different from the familiar random  field disordered state ( and similar to the usual spin glass state ) because the global up / down symmetry is preserved ; consequently , for @xmath47 there is still a true phase transition in which this symmetry is broken@xcite .      in a concentration range @xmath48",
    ", the ground state is presumed to be a spin glass .",
    "spin glass investigations tend still to be preoccupied with the issue of the existence of a transition as a function of dimension , external field , and spin type . indeed",
    ", it is still unsettled whether the @xmath49 ising spin glass really has a transition at finite temperature , or whether it is at the lower critical dimensionality@xcite .",
    "rather little has been done to test the universality of the critical exponents , as almost all simulations have used simple cubic ( sc ) lattices with the discrete @xmath44 distribution of random bonds .",
    "monte carlo and series studies for the fcc lattice with @xmath44 bonds @xcite gave values of the spin - glass exponents @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 consistent with the sc @xmath44 model ; so did _ diluted _ @xmath44 model on a simple cubic lattice@xcite and ( modulo large error bars ) gaussian - distributed random bonds on the simple cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "the above results are consistent with universality .",
    "however , it has also been proposed that @xmath50 is more negative and the binder cumulant is larger for gaussian bond randomness than for @xmath44 randomness@xcite ; presumably the diluted fcc is more similar to the latter model , since its discrete randomness generically allows exact degeneracy of ground states .",
    "we now consider the approach @xmath54 , where the spin glass long  range order finally disappears . in this regime , the order is just barely propagating along tortuous , effectively one  dimensional paths , and consequently we expect @xmath55 ( exponentially ) as @xmath54@xcite .    note that @xmath56",
    ". in frustrated models with discrete bond distributions , such as the present case , two portions of a connected cluster might be connected by ( say ) two chains of bonds , each canceling the other and allowing one portion to be flipped relative to the other portion at no cost in energy ; for propagation of order , it is as if no chain existed , i.  e. , the effective concentration of bonds is lowered by the cancellations .",
    "we use the single spin flip monte carlo metropolis algorithm in our simulations .",
    "spins are updated sequentially and randomly .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed , limiting the possible lattice sizes to even numbers .",

    "we wish to determine the order of the phase transition and how the order of the transition is changed by introducing disorder into the system in form of slight stochastic dilution .",
    "the magnetic order in this regime is clearly antiferromagnet , consistent with earlier simulations , and shall be closer examined in section [ sec : cont - afm ] .",
    "the pure antiferromagnet on a fcc lattice is known to undergo a temperature driven first order phase transition@xcite , as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "early monte carlo simulations by grest and gabl@xcite as well as giebultowicz@xcite reported a change from a first order to a continuous phase transition upon dilution .",
    "grest and gabl located the tricritical point at a critical concentration @xmath78 using ising  spins , whereas giebultowicz found a slightly lower @xmath79 with a heisenberg  spin simulation .",

    "[ stag - sus ] .",

    "[ chi - sgp=7-scale ] .",
    "all data for @xmath66 with the exception of @xmath164 scale well with @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "the fact that the spin glass susceptibility satisfies the above scaling form ( [ scale - chi - sg ] ) strongly suggests that the magnetic order of this model has changed between @xmath24 and @xmath19 from antiferromagnet to spin glass .    in fig .",
    "[ binp=7 ] we present our data of @xmath198 at @xmath19 .",
    "the data show the typical behaviour as it has been observed in short range spin glasses , i.  e. , the data merge at approximately @xmath194 , indicating the phase transition .",
    "there is even a slight tendency of fanning out of the data below this intersection point , which is a strong evidence for the occurrence of a phase transition .",
    "such a fanning out is usually observed in uniform systems . in our system",
    "this may be due to the proximity to the tricritical point or to residual short range antiferromagnetic order ( see below ) .",
    "the best fit was achieved with @xmath199 and @xmath200 , which agrees well with our estimates from the scaled spin glass susceptibility .",
    "the stronger scattering of this quantity , especially of the @xmath201 $ ] data , may be due to insufficient disorder averaging ( 40 systems for @xmath60 ) and could probably be decreased with additional computational power .    in fig .",
    "[ sg - cor - len ] the temperature dependence of @xmath202 and @xmath21 are presented .",
    "while the spin glass correlation length is very small for large @xmath82 but increases drastically as @xmath203 , the antiferromagnetic correlation length starts at a higher level but increases slower than @xmath202 ; it ceases to increase at about @xmath204 and saturates for lower temperatures .",
    "all these results of our simulations at @xmath19 are consistent with the interpretation that in this dilution regime we witness indeed a spin glass transition , but also encounter antiferromagnetic order of long but _",
    "finite _ range being embedded into long range spin glass order .",
    "apparently , a change of magnetic order has taken place within the interval @xmath205 , where @xmath41 denotes the critical dilution , where this change happens .",
    "additional simulations were performed for concentrations @xmath206 . with stronger dilution",
    "we find that the spin glass phase already encountered for @xmath19 persists .",
    "both , spin glass susceptibility and binder cumulant of the order parameter scale well in this regime with slight dilution dependent critical exponents .",
    "also , in this regime the data of the binder cumulant stay together below @xmath20 for all sizes , as has been observed in other short range ising spin glass simulations .",
    "unfortunately , it is increasingly difficult in this regime to equilibrate the systems . as the concentration is lowered , the critical temperature decreases rapidly ( as expected from our argument earlier , that @xmath207 with @xmath208 ) , but the characteristic microscopic energy barriers remain of order unity .",
    "metastability becomes an increasingly important problem and is prohibitive in large systems . in our simulations , for @xmath209 we were unable to equilibrate the @xmath60 systems sufficiently close to @xmath20 within reasonable computer time .",
    "from analysing the correlation function in the strong dilution regime we find two results : first , the spin glass correlation length shows a similar divergence close to the critical temperature for @xmath210 as we have seen in the previous subsection , confirming again the development of long range spin glass order .",
    "second , we still find short range antiferromagnetic order , which decreases with lower concentration : for @xmath211 @xmath21 rises slowly when @xmath82 is lowered and at @xmath20 we have @xmath212 ; for @xmath22 the correlation length remains constant at @xmath213 for all temperatures which we can simulate ( @xmath214 , t_c(p=0.4)\\approx 0.47 $ ] ) .    furthermore , both critical exponents @xmath51 and @xmath50 apparently decrease with increasing dilution ( see the fitted values in table  i ) .",
    "the generic theoretical expectation is that the exponents should be universal all along the spin glass transition line , but the issue of universality is not completely settled in diluted systems@xcite . in our case , we note that the drift in the exponents is pronounced for @xmath215 but minimal for @xmath216 .",
    "thus we suggest that this dependence is an artifact of the antiferromagnetic correlation length , which is large and @xmath40-dependent for @xmath215 , but is quite small for @xmath217 . however , we have insufficient information to check this proposition , and shall come back to this issue in the conclusion .",
    "we conclude , that for the whole range @xmath25 $ ] our simulations testify the existence of a spin glass phase transition for the short range antiferromagnetic ising model on a fcc lattice .",
    "simultaneously , the model also exhibits residual antiferromagnetic order , that is relatively long ranged at @xmath19 and saturates close to the critical temperature ; it decreases with further dilution , showing no temperature dependence for @xmath22 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a monte carlo simulation of the diluted short range antiferromagnetic ising model on a fcc lattice . the main purpose was to investigate the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of this model .",
    "in the undiluted case ( @xmath13 ) we have found a first order phase transition to an antiferromagnetically ordered state , consistent with earlier simulations . upon slight dilution ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic order persists , the first order transition becoming weaker and changing to a continuous transition at the tricritical concentration @xmath218 . at @xmath24",
    "we still find antiferromagnetic order from analysis of the correlation function and scaling of the staggered susceptibility .",
    "together with scaling of the heat capacity , we find mutually consistent critical exponents .",
    "the question of universality remains unclear ; in view of the proximity to @xmath218 it seems likely that we observe tricritical exponents at this point .",
    "below @xmath24 the divergence of the spin glass correlation length as well as scaling of the spin glass susceptibility and the binder cumulant of the order parameter signal spin glass order .",
    "this means , that there must be a multicritical point at some concentration @xmath205 , where the change of magnetic order takes place .",
    "simultaneously , the quasi temperature independent staggered magnetization and the saturation of the antiferromagnetic correlation length suggest the breakdown of antiferromagnetic long range order .",
    "the fact , that the antiferromagnetic correlation length saturates while spin glass correlations still grow contradicts the view of a dynamically inhibited transition to an antiferromagnet .",
    "rather , our data suggest that the coexistence of antiferromagnetic short range order together with long range established spin glass order seems to be a special phenomena of this diluted model .",
    "let us now turn to the question of universality in the spin glass phase .",
    "in this phase ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : spin - glass - order ] ) our scaling fits yielded critical exponents slightly dependent on dilution ( compare table  [ exponents ] ) ; we speculated , that this could be an artifact of the changing antiferromagnetic correlation length .",
    "even in unfrustrated models , there is still controversy over the universality of exponents under dilution@xcite . although our simulations are less extensive than the mc ",
    "simulations of the short range ising spin glass by bhatt and young and by ogielski , it is interesting to compare our exponents with their values for the @xmath44model in @xmath49 . for this model ,",
    "they find@xcite @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "these values are just at or slightly out of the error margins of the present simulations , so that it is not entirely clear , whether the two models lie in the same universality class .",
    "note also , that our value of @xmath52 is smaller than for the `` classic '' spin glass simulations , roughly @xmath221 for @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "additional simulations of larger systems would be desirable to confirm our result .",
    "it should be noted that even the best current simulations on hypercubic lattices have not put to rest the basic question whether the lower critical dimension for ising spin glasses is below 3 , or equal to 3@xcite . at the more modest scale of our simulation , it can not be decisively answered whether the diluted fcc ising antiferromagnet has a genuine spin glass transition , and if so whether it has precisely the same exponents as the standard example of @xmath44 spin glasses on hypercubic lattices using array processors .",
    "however , our data is consistent with both of these propositions .",
    "although in this work we have performed an ising model simulation we find striking similarities with experimental observations in dms , which have heisenberg like magnetic moments@xcite . not only are the respective phase diagrams ( compare fig .",
    "[ phase - diag ] and ref .  ) qualitatively similar and the various critical concentrations are numerically close , but also the concentration dependence of @xmath21 in the spin glass phase agrees well with experiment . to be more specific",
    ", a comparison of our simulations with intensive experimental studies by giebultowicz et  al.@xcite on @xmath222 shows the following agreements : ( i ) the afm transition is first order for @xmath77 $ ] , ( ii ) the transition is continuous ( to an afm long  range state ) for @xmath17 $ ] , ( iii ) the afm order is of large but finite range for @xmath223 in the spin glass phase and ( iv ) the afm correlation length decreases with increasing dilution @xmath224 .",
    "these results together with the measured divergence of the nonlinear susceptibility in @xmath225 ( see ref .  ) below @xmath226 do support the view of a spin glass phase in experimental heisenberg systems .    c.  w. and a.  z. would like to thank reiner kree for helpful discussions and j.  holm for his assistance .",
