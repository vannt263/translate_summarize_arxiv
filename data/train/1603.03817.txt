    "-4 mm      limit theorems for random shapes have been a topic of recurring interest in both probability and statistical mechanics .",
    "one successful line of attack came up in the 1990s under the banner of the _ wulff construction_. there one was interested in the asymptotic shape of a `` droplet '' of one equilibrium phase ( e.g. , the minus phase of the ising model at inverse temperature  @xmath2 ) immersed in another ( the plus ising phase ) subject to a restriction on the overall order parameter ( the magnetization , or the total number of plus spins , in the ising case ) .",
    "see , e.g. , alexander , chayes and chayes  @xcite , dobrushin , koteck and shlosman  @xcite , ioffe and schonmann  @xcite for studies in the spatial dimension @xmath8 and cerf  @xcite , bodineau  @xcite , cerf and pisztora  @xcite and bodineau , ioffe and velenik  @xcite for work in dimensions @xmath9 .    in all of the above mentioned studies the asymptotic shape is determined as a solution of an _ isoperimetric problem _ ; namely , @xmath10 for @xmath11 denoting the lebesgue measure of  @xmath12 and @xmath13 being a perimeter functional given explicitly in terms of a model - dependent surface tension @xmath14 by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the unit outer normal to  @xmath17 at point  @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the @xmath20-dimensional hausdorff measure on  @xmath17 .",
    "the mode of convergence of the random shape to its deterministic limit is generally stronger in @xmath8 than in  @xmath9 .",
    "this is due to a different type of continuity of the perimeter functional .",
    "recently , an interesting example which is related to but does not quite fit under the umbrella of the wulff construction program emerged in the work of berestycki and yadin  @xcite .",
    "they studied random walks of time - length  @xmath0 that are subject to an interaction suppressing , through a gibbs weight at inverse temperature  @xmath2 , the internal vertex boundary of the walk range ( i.e. , the set of sites visited by the walk ) .",
    "the analysis in  @xcite determined the ( typical ) spatial size of the range in the limit @xmath3 but made no definitive conclusions on the limit shape .    in the present paper",
    "we prove the existence of a limit shape for a class of self - interacting random walks closely related to that studied in  @xcite ; namely , those where the `` energy '' of a random walk configuration is the length of the external edge boundary of the range measured using a sample of random , non - negative , shift - ergodic weights .",
    "a novel feature here is that this limit shape is _ no longer _ a solution of an isoperimetric problem . instead , after a judicious rescaling of the relevant quantities , it is the minimizer of @xmath21 where @xmath13 is a quantity of the form defined above and @xmath22 denotes the principal ( i.e. , smallest ) eigenvalue of the negative laplacian in  @xmath12 with dirichlet boundary conditions on  @xmath17 .",
    "some attributes of the isoperimetric problem of course remain in effect ; e.g. , the eigenvalue part of the functional acts as a kind of soft lower bound on the volume . however , the precise shape is a consequence of a subtle interplay between both terms and , in general , the minimizers of and are not homothetic .",
    "a companion paper ( biskup and procaccia  @xcite ) carries out a detailed study of this variational problem .",
    "as it turns out , our results are restricted to spatial dimension @xmath8 and they require the limit of zero temperatures , @xmath4 .",
    "the restriction on the dimension is ( partly ) a matter of convenience  indeed , the control of the shape in @xmath9 would suffer the same technical challenges as in the above wulff construction studies .",
    "the limit of zero temperatures is more serious and is dictated by our inability to control all aspects of the problem in full generality .",
    "( in particular , the variational problem may be relevant only at  @xmath23 . )",
    "notwithstanding , since we allow the edge weights to be random , we are able to demonstrate a rich class of possible limit shapes .",
    "let us now move to precise definitions .",
    "although we will ultimately restrict attention to  @xmath8 we will keep  @xmath24 general in the forthcoming discussion until we get to the main result .",
    "this will allow us to track the role of  @xmath24 in the numerical values of some important exponents .",
    "given a finite set  @xmath25 ,",
    "let @xmath26 denote the complement in  @xmath27 of the set of vertices in the unique infinite connected component of  @xmath28  in short , @xmath26 is  @xmath29 with all of the `` holes '' filled .",
    "consider the continuous - time simple random walk @xmath30 on  @xmath31 with uniform jump rate  @xmath32 and let @xmath33 be its law for @xmath34 .",
    "write @xmath35 for the local time at  @xmath18 and define @xmath36 the reason for taking the hull is that we wish the interaction energy to depend only on the geometry of the outer boundary of the visited set .",
    "consider now the set @xmath37 of ( unoriented ) edges in  @xmath31 and let  @xmath38 be a collection of edge weights .",
    "given a set  @xmath25 , let  @xmath39 denote the set of edges in  @xmath37 that have exactly one endpoint in  @xmath29 .",
    "the `` energy '' of a finite set  @xmath29 is then given by the hamiltonian @xmath40 for  @xmath41 we consider the gibbs measure @xmath42 on the path space defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 with @xmath45 denoting the expectation with respect to  @xmath33 .",
    "a canonical ( and simplest ) choice of the weights is @xmath46 .",
    "however , this will lead to a rather uninteresting limit shape ( namely , a square ) and so , in order to get a larger variety of possible limit shapes , we will permit the weights to be random . some natural restriction on the law of the weights is still in order ; these are the subject of :    [ def1 ] we will call a probability law  @xmath47 on  @xmath48 _ admissible _ if it is stationary and ergodic with respect to translates of  @xmath31 and the marginal law of @xmath49 is compactly supported in @xmath50 for each  @xmath51 .    the basic problem we wish to address is the behavior of the walk sampled from @xmath52 for  @xmath0 and  @xmath2 large , for a given ( typical ) sample of the random weights",
    "@xmath53 distributed according to some admissible law  @xmath47 .",
    "the main focus is the asymptotic shape of the random walk support ; cf fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    a reader interested in physics might wish to have a physical system in mind that could be represented by the above class of models .",
    "one such system consists of a hydrophobic polymer chain of length  @xmath0 immersed in a water - based solvent .",
    "the negative affinity between the polymer and the solvent causes the polymer to fold so that the number of contacts with the solvent is minimized .",
    "the contact energy is represented by  @xmath54 ; the inverse temperature  @xmath2 tunes the balance between the energy and the entropy of the paths .",
    "making the weights random is quite natural , and particularly so in dimension  @xmath8 , as that permits us to take into account spatial inhomogeneities of the physical substrate on which the solvent and the polymer co - exist .",
    "we refer to , e.g. , the book by den hollander  @xcite for more information on polymers in random environment .    0.2 cm    , from @xmath55 for the random walk of time - length @xmath56 at four values of the inverse temperature @xmath57 @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and  @xmath61 , respectively as labeled left to right .",
    "the emergence of an asymptotic shape , which by our main result should be a perfect square in the limit @xmath4 , is quite apparent .",
    "the sizes of the external boundary in these samples are 156 , 112 , 66 and 54 , respectively .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]      as noted above , berestycki and yadin  @xcite ( apparently prompted by questions from i.  benjamini ) studied a related model of an interacting random walk .",
    "there are two notable differences between their and our setting : first , their interaction includes the internal components of the boundary and , second , it is given by the number of _ vertices _ on the inner boundary .",
    "for this case they showed that the path is confined ( with different type of control in @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) on the spatial scale @xmath62 the exponent is strictly less than @xmath63 in all spatial dimensions @xmath64 ; the walk is thus `` squeezed '' by the interaction relative to its typical ( diffusive ) scaling .",
    "this conclusion should naturally be compared with that for the model where the `` self - interaction '' is proportional to the cardinality of the whole range . in this case",
    ", bolthausen  @xcite showed that the walk is confined to the spatial scale @xmath65 .",
    "( bolthausen s paper is actually focused on @xmath8 only but one can relate this to the problem of brownian motion among poissonian obstacles studied by sznitman  @xcite in @xmath8 and povel  @xcite in all @xmath9 . )",
    "the minimizing shape is then determined by the variational problem @xmath66 whose unique minimizer is , thanks to the faber - krahn inequality , a euclidean ball .",
    "the appearance of the dirichlet eigenvalue has to do with the large - deviations cost of keeping the walk confined to a given spatial region .",
    "the associated large - deviations principle ( which goes back to donsker and varadhan  @xcite ) underlies a large body of literature on random walks interacting via their local time and/or through an underlying random environment ; e.g. , the study of the parabolic anderson model ( cf knig  @xcite for a recent review ) , random walk and/or brownian motion among random obstacles ( sznitman  @xcite ) , etc . two recent papers of asselah and shapira  @xcite are relevant for our context as they develop a detailed large - deviation approach to the size of the boundary of the random walk range in spatial dimensions @xmath9 .",
    "this expands on the study of moderate deviations for the brownian `` sausage '' by van den berg , bolthausen and den hollander  @xcite .",
    "our variational problem is kind of a mix of and .",
    "this is because the mechanisms underlying the latter two problems meet , and are able to compete , in our model .",
    "understanding this competition is key for a proper description of the walk at large time scales .",
    "we are now ready to give the statements of our results . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to dimension @xmath8 .",
    "the main take - away message from this note is :    [ thm-0 ] let  @xmath8 and suppose that the law of edge weights  @xmath47 is admissible .",
    "then there is a non - empty bounded open convex set  @xmath67 and , for each  @xmath68 , there is @xmath69 such that for all @xmath70 and for @xmath71 as in , @xmath72 for @xmath47-almost every realization of the weights .",
    "a natural problem next is the determination of the shape  @xmath73 for specific choices of the interaction .",
    "as hinted above , this will be done by characterizing  @xmath73 as the minimizer ( unique , modulo translates ) of a suitable variational functional . we will take @xmath74 as our class of admissible continuum domains .",
    "( this means that each @xmath75 is a bounded , open , connected and simply - connected set in  @xmath76 whose boundary is the trace of a simple closed curve . ) given a norm  @xmath77 on  @xmath76 and writing @xmath78\\to{{\\mathbb{r}}}^2 $ ] for the curve constituting @xmath17 ( where , necessarily , @xmath79 ) we define the @xmath77-perimeter of  @xmath12 by @xmath80\\\\0= t_0<t_1<\\ldots < t_n=1 \\end{subarray } } \\,\\sum_{i=1}^n\\rho\\bigl(\\gamma(t_i)-\\gamma(t_{i-1})\\bigr).\\ ] ] for @xmath75 we then set @xmath81 with @xmath82 as defined in .",
    "the object  @xmath83 plays the role of a large - deviation functional for the asymptotic shape ; we will thus particularly be interested in sets in  @xmath84 that minimize  @xmath85 .",
    "this is an analysis problem that has been studied in a companion paper ( biskup and procaccia  @xcite ) .",
    "let us recall the salient conclusions of this work :    1 .   for any choice of the norm",
    "@xmath77 , the functional @xmath85 achieves its minimum on  @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , there is @xmath86 such that @xmath87 2 .",
    "the set @xmath73 is convex and can be taken to be symmetric under reflections ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "it is also symmetric under all rotations that preserve the norm  @xmath77 .",
    "letting @xmath89 denote the hausdorff distance between sets  @xmath90 , for each @xmath68 there is @xmath91 such that , for each @xmath75 , @xmath92 moreover , the map @xmath93 is continuous as a map between the set of continuous functions on the unit circle ( endowed with the supremum norm ) and the set of bounded non - empty open subsets of  @xmath76 ( endowed with the hausdorff metric ) .    in order to use these results to determine  @xmath73",
    ", we thus have to show how to extract the relevant norm  @xmath77 from the particular problem at hand .",
    "we first need some terminology and notation .",
    "consider  @xmath94 regarded as a graph with its nearest - neighbor structure and let @xmath95 denote its graph dual .",
    "a path of length  @xmath96 is a sequence of vertices @xmath97 such that @xmath98 and  @xmath99 are nearest neighbors for each  @xmath100 .",
    "a similar definition applies to paths on  @xmath95 which we then call dual paths .",
    "a path ( or a dual path ) is self - avoiding if no vertex appears in the corresponding sequence of vertices more than once .",
    "for any @xmath101 , let  @xmath102 denote the set of all self - avoiding dual paths @xmath103 ( for any  @xmath104 ) such that  @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    ".    given a self - avoiding dual path  @xmath103 , let @xmath107 denote the sequence of edges in  @xmath94 such that  @xmath108 is the edge dual to  @xmath109 . assuming a collection of weights  @xmath110 is given , we then set @xmath111 and define @xmath112 relying on duality ,  @xmath77 can be identified with the distance in the _ first - passage percolation _ ( fpp ) for weights distributed according to  @xmath47 .",
    "( in this identification , @xmath49 is the passage time for the edge dual to  @xmath113 . )",
    "it is known ( see , e.g. , auffinger , damron and hanson  @xcite for a recent review ) that the fpp distance is asymptotic to a deterministic norm .",
    "this underlies our next claim :    [ thm - norm ] suppose  @xmath8 and assume that  @xmath47 is admissible . then there is a norm  @xmath77 on  @xmath76 such that for @xmath47-almost every realization of the weights , @xmath114    the fpp norm  @xmath77 is actually constructed from  and is thus completely determined by  the @xmath47-almost sure limits @xmath115 whose existence is , in our case , fairly immediate from the subadditive ergodic theorem ; cf lemma  [ lemma-3.1ue ] .",
    "the above statement just requires combining with some additional uniformity considerations .",
    "as soon as the norm  @xmath77 is identified for each given law of the weights , we can complete the above shape theorem by :    [ thm-1 ] the set  @xmath73 in theorem  [ thm-0 ] is a minimizer ( unique , up to translates ) of  @xmath85 with the perimeter functional @xmath13 constructed using the asymptotic fpp norm  @xmath77 defined , e.g. , by .",
    "let us proceed with some remarks on the above setting and results .",
    "we begin with comments on the connection between the norm and the limit shape .",
    "\\(1 ) in the canonical situation @xmath46 ( i.e. , with constant weights ) ,  @xmath77 is the @xmath116-norm and  @xmath73 is then an @xmath117-ball ( a square ) .",
    "in the situation treated by berestycki and yadin  @xcite  where the interaction is through the number of boundary vertices rather then edges  we expect  @xmath77 to be the @xmath117-norm and  @xmath73 thus an @xmath116-ball ( a diamond ) .",
    "this is in fact quite consistent with the numerical simulations shown in  @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) for non - degenerate laws of the weights , the fpp norm  @xmath77 is generally not explicitly computable .",
    "a question then arises what possible norms one can get in our class of models and what shapes then arise as minimizers of the associated functional @xmath85 . here",
    "we recall :    for each compact convex set  @xmath118 that has a non - empty interior and is symmetric under the reflection @xmath88 there is a translation - invariant , ergodic law  @xmath47 on @xmath48 such that  @xmath119 is the unit ball in the norm  @xmath77 defined implicitly by .",
    "moreover , the weights @xmath49 are bounded under  @xmath47 and their law is strongly mixing .",
    "the norms on  @xmath120 are in one - to - one correspondence with the symmetric ( non - empty ) compact convex sets @xmath118 via the equivalence @xmath121 in particular , all norms in  @xmath120 arise as fpp norms for some law of the weights as described in the theorem .",
    "however , the construction in @xcite does not make @xmath49 bounded away from zero ( the whole argument is based on existence of arbitrarily fast edges ) and so we are unfortunately not guaranteed to get all norms from laws that are admissible in the sense of definition  [ def1 ] .",
    "notwithstanding , thanks to a continuity of the fpp norm in the underlying law of the edge weights , we get at least a dense subset of all norms .",
    "the question on what limit shapes arise from the class of admissible laws is more complicated .",
    "indeed , at this time we do not even know whether the map @xmath93 ( of a norm to a symmetric , bounded , open and convex set ) is injective and/or surjective .",
    "this is very different for the isoperimetric problem where we have the one - to - one correspondence  .",
    "\\(3 ) a particularly interesting sub - class of admissible laws are those that make the weights i.i.d .",
    "a good amount of research has gone into the analytic properties of such norms .",
    "durrett and liggett  @xcite gave examples of i.i.d .",
    "laws for which  @xmath77 is not strictly convex ; this implies facets on the ball in the  @xmath77-metric and , by theorem  1.7 of biskup and procaccia  @xcite , appearance of corners on  @xmath73 .",
    "however , the opposite regime  namely , the conditions for strict convexity of the fpp norm  is only poorly understood ( for the i.i.d .",
    "setting ) ; see the review by auffinger , damron and hanson  @xcite .",
    "we advance some of the existing conjectures into :    [ conj-1.5 ] for i.i.d",
    ".  laws of the edge weights that are continuously distributed and bounded uniformly away from zero and infinity , @xmath73 as well as the isoperimetric minimizer ( a.k.a .",
    "the wulff shape ) for the associated fpp norm have no corners .",
    "notwithstanding , facets on both  @xmath73 and the wulff shape are allowed and , most likely , typical .    the rest of our comments are concerned with possible extensions of the present work .",
    "\\(4 ) we believe that a shape theorem holds for all  @xmath2 sufficiently large although we do not think that the limit shape is obtained by optimizing the functional of the form  .",
    "our need for taking @xmath4 stems from the inability to control the surface - order terms in the `` eigenvalue part '' of the contribution to the partition function ; see also remark  [ remark : note ] .",
    "any progress on this question is certainly of interest .",
    "\\(5 ) theorem  [ thm-0 ] should extend without significant changes to discrete - time random walks .",
    "our focus on continuous - time walks is more advantageous technically as that makes functional - analytic techniques and particularly , spectral calculus , readily available .",
    "\\(6 ) the above results should be extendable to all @xmath64 ( still under  @xmath4 ) provided that we weaken the hausdorff metric to @xmath122 the extension would carry a significant amount of technical overhead that would ultimately detract from the principal message of our paper",
    ". however , we still think it is worthy an attempt .",
    "another obstruction is that our understanding of the variational problem for the functional is presently considerably more advanced in @xmath8 than in  @xmath9 .",
    "\\(7 ) theorem  [ thm-0 ] discusses the asymptotic shape of the random - walk support but one can also ask about how this shape is positioned relative to the starting point of the walk .",
    "similarly , one might also be interested in the asymptotic law of the endpoint of the path .",
    "we expect that both of these laws can be expressed using the principal eigenfunction of the laplacian .",
    "( essentially , the eigenfunction should correspond to the local - time profile of the walk . )",
    "\\(8 ) our choice of the interaction  the sum of non - negative weights on the outer boundary of the range  is reasonably canonical , but other natural choices exist as well .",
    "one is the size of the inner - vertex boundary ( i.e. , the case related to that in berestycki and yadin  @xcite ) .",
    "however , even this example harbors some of the complications that turn out to be the more severe the more general the interaction becomes : the minimal `` energy '' of paths from @xmath123 to  @xmath124 may no - longer be subadditive in  @xmath96 .",
    "there are ways to overcome this in specific cases ( e.g. , by way of considering random - walk bridges ) but a general approach seems elusive at this point .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to the proofs of the above results .",
    "these come roughly in three parts each of which is the content of one section .",
    "here is the basic starting idea : consider the collection of sets @xmath125 for the random walk started from the origin , @xmath126 takes values in  @xmath127 . since the interaction depends only on  @xmath126 , to control the shape it suffices to study @xmath128 to estimate this probability , we generally need upper bounds on the numerator and lower bounds on the denominator .",
    "the essential point is that , in both of these , the computation separates into two parts : computing @xmath129 and matching the result against @xmath130 .",
    "the proofs are then organized as follows : section  [ sec3 ] expresses the probability @xmath129 by means of the principal eigenvalue  @xmath131 of the ( negative ) discrete laplacian in  @xmath132 ( defined precisely below ) .",
    "this yields an expression of the form @xmath133}.\\ ] ] the next step , carried out in section  [ sec4 ] , is a coarse - graining argument .",
    "this is achieved by a resummation of all  @xmath132 that give rise to the same continuum object , called the _ skeleton _",
    "@xmath134 , which is a polygonal domain in  @xmath76 that closely approximates the given set  @xmath132 ( in the hausdorff distance ) .",
    "the result is now expressed in terms of the norm  @xmath77 and the perimeter functional  @xmath135 defined above in the form that looks , roughly , as @xmath136}.\\ ] ] the reason for using skeletons is that they permit us to perform local optimization of the boundary energy while , at the same time , reduce the combinatorial complexity of possible shapes .",
    "the expression in the exponent on the right of has the form of the functional  @xmath83 .",
    "with some extra work , this allows us to complete the proofs of main results .",
    "this occurs in section  [ sec5 ] ; the final section ( section  [ sec5a ] ) derives some useful estimates for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the laplacian in finite subsets of  @xmath94 .",
    "the goal of this section is to express the probability law of  @xmath126 under the random walk measure using the principal eigenvalue of the laplacian .",
    "this is a classical problem that lies , in one way or another , at the heart of all the aforementioned studies by bolthausen  @xcite , sznitman  @xcite , povel  @xcite and others .",
    "still , since our focus is on controlling all aspects of the problem at the _ surface _",
    "order , some additional caution is needed .",
    "let @xmath127 be as above and let @xmath137 . abusing the earlier notation slightly ,",
    "let @xmath138 where the first sum is over unordered pairs of nearest - neighbor vertices in  @xmath31 and the infimum is over functions @xmath139 with the stated properties .",
    "modulo a sign change , this is the principal eigenvalue of the discrete laplacian @xmath140\\ ] ] in  @xmath132 with dirichlet boundary conditions on  @xmath141 .",
    "we will also frequently need the notation  @xmath142 for the @xmath143-th eigenvalue of  @xmath144 in  @xmath132 , where @xmath145 , and we will write @xmath146 to denote the associated ( @xmath143-th ) eigenfunction normalized so that @xmath147 this eigenfunction is not necessarily unique , but it can always be taken real valued .    let us start with bounds on  @xmath129 .",
    "the upper bound is quite simple :    [ prop-3.1w ] for any @xmath137 , @xmath148    proof let @xmath149 denote the first exit time of the random walk @xmath150 from  @xmath132 .",
    "the function @xmath151 solves the differential equation @xmath152 with initial / boundary data @xmath153 in terms of the canonical inner product @xmath154 in  @xmath155 , we get @xmath156 which in the language of eigenvalues / eigenfunctions of  @xmath157 becomes @xmath158 invoking the cauchy - schwarz inequality , the bound @xmath159 along with the fact that @xmath146 is normalized , and in particular obeys @xmath160 ,  yield @xmath161 but @xmath162 and so the claim follows",
    ".    the corresponding lower bound is somewhat more involved .",
    "fortunately , we will only need it for a reduced class of sets .",
    "then we have :    [ prop-3.2 ] given @xmath75 convex , let @xmath163 there is @xmath164 and , for each  @xmath165 , there is  @xmath166 such that for all @xmath167 , all @xmath68 small enough and all @xmath137 with @xmath168 then @xmath169 holds as soon as  @xmath0 is sufficiently large .",
    "given a finite and connected  @xmath170 , let @xmath171 denote the _ intrinsic diameter _ of  @xmath132 ; i.e. , the diameter of a graph with vertices in  @xmath132 and edges with both vertices in  @xmath132 measured using the intrinsic distance . an important input in the proof are the following estimates on the size of the spectral gap and decay of the principal eigenfunction relative to the size of the set in :    [ lemma-2.3 ] for  @xmath75 convex and @xmath68 small enough , there are constants @xmath172 such that if @xmath137 obeys @xmath173 , then @xmath174 @xmath175 once @xmath71 is sufficiently large .",
