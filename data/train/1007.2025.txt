    "recent progress in experimental and theoretical techniques have triggered enormous possibilities of using organic molecules as a fundamental complement to silicon in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "this has opened up possibilities of fabricating logical circuits at the single molecule level @xcite .",
    "such molecular state electronics requires the precise knowledge of electron transport in organic molecules the finite size of atoms , molecules and clusters offers an advantage in designing tailor - made materials to perform desired functions by exploiting the quantum mechanical phenomena of electrons in a confined space . besides such exciting developments on the design and fabrication of molecular devices ,",
    "experiments have been performed on the electrical properties of single molecules @xcite , and highly sophisticated simulation tools for charge transport through molecules have been developed @xcite .",
    "recently , using a single benzene molecule , the first molecular transistor was developed @xcite .",
    "several molecular device concepts are based on the existence of potential barriers within molecules , which prevent the free flow of electrons and thus create a tunable system @xcite .",
    "aviram and ratner @xcite proposed such a device in 1974 based on an organic molecule made of @xmath5 donor and @xmath5 acceptor moieties linked by a saturated spacer and sandwiched between two metallic electrodes .",
    "this concept has recently been verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "the presence of potential barriers is essential also in devices which are closer to traditional electronic electronic components .",
    "a diode is a two - terminal switch consisting of source and drain that can turn a current on and off depending on the direction of flow . in the case of molecular diodes ,",
    "switching the current on or off requires tuning the molecular discrete energy levels . in an experiment in 1999 @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a single molecule of @xmath6 could behave like a resonant tunneling diode .",
    "the resonance effect of tunneling the electrons was observed at @xmath7 bias with a peak current of @xmath8 .",
    "the molecule consists of three benzene rings connected to each other by the acetylene group .",
    "two @xmath9 atoms of the central ring are replaced by the @xmath10 and @xmath11 group on opposite sides .",
    "this asymmetrical configuration enables the molecule susceptible to change its configuration under perturbation .    in the present work we are interested in a quantitative investigation of molecular structures containing aliphatic chains acting as barriers inserted between aromatic @xmath5 conjugated rings ,",
    "focusing on systems made up of three phenyl rings separated by insulator groups @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we show analytically as well as numerically that when the two insulator groups are different an asymmetric electron transport in the presence of external electric field is possible , thus resembling a diode which allows one way electron transport . to test the barrier properties we have performed analytical quantum mechanical calculations and also performed numerical simulations .",
    "we have based our analysis on the analytical results obtained for the occupation probability of the energy levels , the delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the homo - lumo energy gap ( hlg ) .",
    "the hlg is a critical parameter for the molecular admittance because it is a measure of the hardness of the electron density @xcite .",
    "the larger the hlg , the more stable the molecule , and therefore the harder it is to rearrange its electron density under the presence of an external electron .",
    "thus the molecule presents lesser admittance to the incoming electron .",
    "and @xmath12 are any one of the insulating groups @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "the source of conductivity for a polyphenylene wire is a set of delocalized @xmath5 type molecular orbitals above and below the plane of a single benzene ring . in this section",
    ", we present a quantum mechanical analysis of electron density behaviour of the polyphenylene wire in which insulator groups @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are inserted between two aromatic rings and an external electric field is applied .",
    "the system considered is shown in figure 1 , where @xmath14 and @xmath12 are the insulator groups @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . if @xmath13 then an asymmetry is generated in the electron conduction process when an electric field is applied .",
    "we now present here a simple three state quantum mechanical model which provides an intuitive understanding of the role played by the aliphatic fragments in the triphenyl system .",
    "the hamiltonian for a single electron in a system with three levels @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , coupled through an external perturbation , can be written , in second quantized formalism , as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are the occupation numbers of the three levels accessible to the electron , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron in the @xmath22 level , @xmath23 and @xmath24 represents the interlevel coupling or the tunneling matrix element .",
    "the second term takes into account the perturbing potential @xmath25 through its value @xmath26 in the location corresponding to the @xmath22 level . if the hamiltonian is expanded in the following simple basis    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    and written in matrix form , it reads , in atomic units , as    @xmath30    we now define the energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 and obtain the three eigenvalues of the above hamiltonian as the roots of the following cubic equation    @xmath33    now for the simple case @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we obtain two eigenvalues as    @xmath36    @xmath37    , for three different values of the ration @xmath38 . ]    in figure 2 we plot the occupancy of the first level @xmath39 as a function of @xmath40 for three values of the ration @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the first coefficient of the eigenvector of the ground state .",
    "the analytical expression for @xmath41 is    @xmath42    the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 describes the effective interaction between the orbitals of the three aromatic rings and therefore will be smaller when an aliphatic group breaks the @xmath0-conjugation and spaces the rings .",
    "an asymmetry is produced when @xmath43 . in figure 2 , when @xmath44 , the single electron will find it easier to tunnel from the first ring to the middle ring through the insulator @xmath14 as compared to the path starting from the middle ring to the third ring via insulator @xmath12 . since @xmath45 ,",
    "the internal barrier between the first ring and the middle ring is small and the aromatic fragments are closer together and strongly interacting . on the other hand when @xmath46 exactly opposite",
    "is true and hence the electron density will tend to localize on the first ring as evident from figure 2 when @xmath47 at a smaller value of @xmath40 compared to the cases @xmath48 and @xmath44 .",
    "this asymmetry that is introduced when @xmath43 can be utilized to design a tunable molecular tunneling diode .",

    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath43 . for @xmath73 the homo",
    "is delocalized over the entire molecule indicating a reduction in the molecular admittance . in this case , the shift of the electron density is obviously less pronounced , since all the @xmath0- electrons are strongly involved in chemical bonds and transfer of an electron from one ring to the other becomes clearly much harder to achieve . on the other hand when @xmath74 the homo energy levels are localized on the central and the right phenyl rings which indicates localization of the excess electron on the right phenyl ring .",

    "a plot of energy gap @xmath59 versus electric field is shown in fig.7 .",
    "for the molecule @xmath63 , the plot is symmetric indicating the absence of any mrtd behaviour . on the other hand , for the second molecule @xmath65 ,",
    "the electron experiences a energy barrier on the positive electric field side .",
    "this basically indicate that on application of an electric field in the positive direction of the molecular axis , the electron experiences a higher barrier as compared to the case of an electric field in the negative direction of the molecular axis .",
    "this asymmetric response of the molecule to the external field is useful for possible molecular tunneling diode application .",
    "replacing @xmath77 with @xmath78 in the @xmath65 molecule does not significantly change the @xmath59 ( @xmath79 ) but on the other hand replacing @xmath77 with @xmath80 significantly reduces the @xmath59 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "this is probably due to the metallic nature of @xmath80 .",
    "we also carried out dft simulations on the @xmath65 molecule with @xmath82 metal atoms replacing the terminal @xmath9 atoms .",
    "the results indicate that the incorporation of the @xmath83 atoms decreases the hlg energy gap to @xmath84 due to the transfer of charge from @xmath83 atoms to the molecule .",
    "motivated by recent interest in the development of alternative to traditional electron devices , we have investigated a oligo - phenyl based double barrier molecular device .",
    "the double barriers have been created by using insulator spacers @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 inserted between two aromatic rings we have carried out analytical as well as numerical studies using hf and dft methods .",
    "we found that when the insulator spacers are same the tunneling matrix elements of the barriers are identical and this leads identical current flowing in both directions of the molecule .",
    "the symmetry can be broken by making the two insulator spacers different .",
    "this leads to asymmetrical electron conduction along either direction of the molecule leading to the desired characteristics of a typical diode .",
    "the asymmetric conduction properties such as the one investigated in this study are relevant for the implementation of molecular tunneling diodes .",
