    "_ introduction . _ [ intro ] a number of light elements like hydrogen , boron , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , silicon , phosphorous , etc . , and their mixtures form strong covalent bonds in the solid and retain much of this bonding structure even when molten  @xcite and in warm - dense - matter ( wdm ) regimes  @xcite .",
    "a theory for predicting the properties of these elements and their mixtures reliably and rapidly is much in demand in many technological applications .",
    "their properties under high compression and temperature are also of great interest in astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "for instance , carbon is an important component of neptune , uranus , extra - solar planets and white dwarfs .",
    "carbon is also a principal ablator material for inertial - confinement fusion ( icf )  @xcite .",
    "many of these applications require the equation of state ( eos ) and transport properties like the electrical conductivity in regimes where experimental determinations are not feasible . the experiments , even when feasible , are still very demanding  @xcite . the theoretical prediction requires the electronic and ionic structures of the system together with their interaction potentials . at very low temperatures ( compared to the fermi energy @xmath3 ) , numerically demanding density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations coupled to molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations provide a reliable method . here",
    "electronic structure calculations for a periodically repeated sample of carbon ( e.g , consisting of @xmath4 atoms , with @xmath4 typically 64 - 100 atoms ) are carried out over a large number of ionic configurations which are evolved using molecular dynamics algorithms .",
    "this method becomes rapidly impractical at finite temperatures due to the large number of electronic states that have to be calculated .",
    "nevertheless , dft+md methods provide benchmark results for testing other more analytical methods .",
    "standard dft reduces the many - electron problem to an effective one - electron problem , while the multi - ion problem is _ not _ reduced to a  single - ion problem .",
    "bonding and molecular formation among the ions are explicitly treated but this limits the number of ions that can be included in the simulation , especially at high temperatures .",
    "sophisticated semi - empirical methods that have emerged from the  embedded - atom \" approach have led to  reactive - potentials \" models which account for bond formation , change of coordination and dependence on bond angle .",
    "carbon presents a complex liquid where conjugated bonds ( @xmath5 ) and weak graphite - like links ( partial conjugation ) are possible .",
    "the potentials developed by brenner incorporate conjugation .",
    "they were used by glosli _",
    "et al . , _",
    "@xcite in their study of the liquid - liquid phase transition in carbon .",
    "the modern versions by los , fasolino , ghirengheli _ et al . , _  @xcite of carbon bond - order potentials ( lrbop ) include long - range effects as well .",
    "these are `` semi - empirical '' in using parameters fitted to bond energies , bond tortional energies etc .",
    ", over a range of data from experiments and simulations .",
    "however , their performance in the wdm regime has been disappointing , even in the low temperature 0.5 to 0.9 ev range , as seen from results on shock - compressed carbon at 100 gpa corresponding to @xmath63.7 g/@xmath1  @xcite .    _ the neutral - pseudo - atom model in the context of complex fluids .",
    "_ in this study we show that the neutral - pseudo - atom ( npa )  @xcite approach works quite well for complex liquids in their _ metallic phase _ , even near the melting point , as was already claimed by the present author and franois perrot in 1990  @xcite .",
    "density - functional theory asserts that the free energy @xmath7)$ ] is a functional of the _ one - body _ electron density @xmath8 , and the _ one - body _ ion density @xmath9 , irrespective of the existence of complex interactions ( e.g. , superconductive associations for electrons ) , and complex - bonding structure for ions .",
    "density - functional theory constructs non - interacting `` kohn - sham electrons '' that move in the one - body kohn - sham potential , and similarly there are non - interacting `` kohn - sham '' ions moving in the `` potential of mean - force '' .",
    "the latter is the classical form of the dft potential acting on an ion , well known in the theory of classical liquids .",
    "such an approach puts a heavy burden on constructing the exchange - correlation functional @xmath10 for the electrons , and the ion - ion correlation functional @xmath11 for the ions which are classical , and do not have exchange ( see eq .  1.13 , p 628 ref .",
    "we model @xmath11 as a sum of hyper - netted - chain and bridge diagrams .",
    "the usual dft+md codes do not use an @xmath12 since the ion - ion many - body problem is not reduced to a one - body problem , unlike in the npa which uses only the one - body ion distribution @xmath13 .",
    "major computational simplifications follow from this full - dft approach .",
    "the method adopted in the npa is to construct the electron - ion pseudopotentials @xmath14 from the dft free - electron - charge pile up @xmath15 formed around a single nucleus placed in the appropriate environment  @xcite ) . very briefly ,",
    "if the electron response function is @xmath16 , the pseudopotential is taken as @xmath17 , giving a simple local pseudopotential at the temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the npa uses an all - electron kohn - sham - mermin calculation and defines within itself the bound and  free \" parts of the electron spectrum , providing the effective ionic charge @xmath2 for a nucleus of charge @xmath19 immersed in the given wdm environment .",
    "the value of @xmath2 changes with density and temperature .",
    "since the npa is an effective `` single - ion '' theory of the complex fluid , one may imagine that it can not provide accurate pair - distribution functions @xmath20 and structure factors @xmath21 of complex fluids prone to covalent bonding .",
    "however , a properly formulated  average - atom \" wdm - model is an _ exact dft theory _  @xcite of such systems , with approximations arising essentially from the electron - xc functional and the ion - correlation functional used .",
    "the `` average - atom '' is the ` kohn - sham ion ' of the fluid .",
    "the npa approach enables us to define a pair - potential between such ions , viz . ,",
    "@xmath22 ; @xmath23 ( atomic units are used throughout ) .",
    "thus the method allows for  bonding \" between two `` effective '' kohn - sham ions . in liquid - c ,",
    "the bond in npa theory is an `` effective bond '' , averaging over electronic effects equivalent to the @xmath24 and other possible configurations with one or many neighbors , used in the valance - bond picture . in the fermi - liquid picture underlying npa",
    ", they are captured through the interplay of friedel oscillations in the electron response to the two ions .",
    "an `` average dimer '' may be more complex than just two ions bonded together . at very low @xmath25 , the bonded form of the liquid",
    "becomes increasingly favored , while at high @xmath25 the monomer - fluid ( i.e. , single ions ) becomes dominant .",
    "one may even anticipate a dimer - monomer phase - transition between the `` average - bond '' dimer and the ` average - monomer ' form .",
    "the ` average ' monomer ( i.e. , the average atom ) covers several ionization states , and hence the mean ionization @xmath2 is not an integer .",
    "thus , even the simplest npa approach implicitly allows a mixture of two fluids .",
    "this point of view is in fact theoretically equivalent to strassler and kittel s  @xcite  pseudo - binary mixture \" model basic to the theory of complex fluids . in ref .",
    "@xcite dharma - wardana and perrot showed that the ionic - structure of liquid - metal phases of c , si and ge can be obtained using an npa - like approach , except that the electron effective mass @xmath26 is re - normalized to a value higher than unity .",
    "the electrons form transient bonds , and become  heavy \" due to self - energy corrections accruing to the electron propagators .",
    "this fermi - liquid interpretation quantitatively explained the unusual features of the @xmath21 of si and ge , viz .",
    ", the shoulder on the high-@xmath27 side of the main peak  @xcite without invoking the picture of transient bonds `` captured '' in computer simulations  @xcite .",

    "the present study does not use the parametrization of the carbon charge density etc .",
    ", proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but use the current npa approach .",
    "recent simulations of wdm carbon to support x - ray scattering experiments  @xcite provide data to test the applicability of npa to complex liquids in the wdm regime .",
    "the npa method used is that of perrot and dharma - wardana  @xcite .",
    "this approach does not use a cell - model but a large correlation sphere of radius @xmath28 which is @xmath6 5 to 10 wigner - seitz radii .",
    "the wigner - seitz radius @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 , where the electron sphere radius @xmath31 is obtained from the mean electron density @xmath8 via @xmath32 .",
    "the npa code works with a given trial input of the electron density , and obtains the quantum mechanically consistent ion density by a self - consistent process , as discussed in , say , murillo _ et al . _",
    "the interacting electrons are mapped to a non - interacting electron fluid at the _ interacting density _ , as needed by kohn - sham theory .",
    "thus the electron chemical potential @xmath33 is unambiguously the non - interacting @xmath33 at the given temperature . a somewhat complex liquid , viz .",
