    "[ sec : intro ]    an @xmath0 linear collider , the international linear collier ( ilc ) , has been discussed as a new experimental tool to study the physics at the electroweak scale and beyond @xcite . the primary purpose of the ilc is to clarify the physics of the electroweak symmetry breaking and physics beyond the standard model ; in order to solve the naturalness problem in the standard model , it is expected that some new physics shows up at the energy scale of @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "discovery and , in particular , precise studies of such new physics should become very important once the ilc will be built .",
    "thus , at the current stage , we should study the potential of the ilc for such purposes .    among various possibilities , supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is one of the prominent candidates of the new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "accordingly , superpartners of the standard - model particles are regarded as significant targets of the ilc . as well as the superparticles , however , we should also study another class of new particles which show up in the supersymmetric models , that is , the heavy higgs bosons .",
    "since the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains two higgs doublets , i.e. , up- and down - type higgs bosons , cp even and odd neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) as well as the charged higgses @xmath10 exist in the physical spectrum as well as the standard - model - like higgs @xmath11 .",
    "detailed study of the heavy higgses provides information about some of the parameters in the mssm like , for example , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of the heavy higgses will be important for the study of the higgs potential and electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the study of the heavey higgses is important both from the point of view of understanding electroweak symmetry breaking as well as for its deep impacts on cosmology .",
    "it has long been recognized that the dark matter in the universe , whose origin can not be explained in the framework of the minimal standard model , may be explained in the mssm . with the @xmath12-parity conservation ,",
    "the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) is stable and hence , if its interaction is weak enough , lsp can be a viable candidate for the cold dark matter .",
    "importantly , in large fraction of the parameter space , the lightest neutralino becomes the lsp which can be the cold dark matter in this case . in the past",
    ", the relic density of the lightest neutralino has been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that , in order to realize the lsp dark matter , there is one caveat ; in many cases , the thermal relic density of the lsp becomes larger than the currently measured dark matter density .",
    "in particular , the density parameter of the dark matter is now well constrained by the wmap @xcite @xmath13 and it is not automatic to realize such density parameter with the lsp .",
    "it is often the case that some mechanism is needed to enhance the annihilation of the lsp to realize the lsp dark matter .",
    "detailed study shows that the relic density of the lsp can become consistent with the wmap value with some particular annihilation process . in the so - called msugra models , the parameter regions where the density parameter of the lsp becomes consistent with the wmap value are classified as `` bulk region , '' `` coannihilation region , '' `` focus - point region , '' `` rapid - annihilation funnels , '' although the annihilation mechanisms used in those regions work in more general framework .",
    "once the supersymmetry is discovered , one of the challenge will be to determine the thermal relic density of the lsp and to see if the lsp dark matter is plausible @xcite .",
    "if successful , it will give us deeper understandings of our universe up to the temperature of @xmath14 .",
    "for this purpose , it is necessary to measure various parameters in the mssm for the calculation of the thermal relic density of the lsp .",
    "such studies have been also performed for the case of the lhc @xcite .",
    "most of those studies have , however , assumed very simple model of supersymmetry breaking , like the msugra model , in estimating the expected uncertainties in the reconstructed value of the thermal relic density of the lsp .",
    "we believe that , once the superparticles are found , it is necessary to calculate the relic density in a model - independent way . only with the lhc",
    ", such a study seems difficult in many cases .    with the ilc , on the contrary , precise determination of the mssm parameters will be possible without assuming any particular model of susy breaking . thus , in this case , the ilc will be able to help reconstructing the relic density of the lsp in many cases . for example , in the focus - point case , in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the ilc can provide useful and significant information for the calculation of the thermal relic density of the lsp .    here",
    ", we pay particular attention to another case , the rapid - annihilation funnels . in this case ,",
    "pair annihilation of the lsp is dominated by the diagram with the @xmath15-channel exchange of the cp - odd neutral higgs boson . in particular , in order to enhance the pair annihilation of the lightest neutralino ,",
    "@xmath1 parameter becomes large in this case .",
    "if the lsp dark matter is realized in the rapid - annihilation funnels , detailed study of the heavy higgs sector in the large @xmath1 case is necessary to calculate the annihilation cross section of the lsp .",
    "strongly motivated by the dark matter physics in the rapid - annihilation funnels ( as well as the study of the higgs potential ) , in this paper , we consider the strategy for studying the properties of the heavy higgs bosons at the ilc assuming an energy and integrated luminosity of @xmath2 tev and @xmath3 ab@xmath4 .",
    "we concentrate on the case where @xmath1 parameter is large and see how and how well we can constrain the properties of the heavy higgs bosons . as we will discuss in the following sections , interactions of the heavy higgses are well parameterized by five parameters .",
    "using pair production processes of the neutral and charged higgs bosons , these parameters can be constrained .",
    "if information from the neutral and charged higgs production processes is combined , it will help improving the determination of properties of the heavy higgses . in this paper",
    ", we particularly consider how to combine information from various processes and how well the resultant constraint can be , using systematic consideration of the production and decay processes .",
    "then , we also study how the results can be used to reconstruct the thermal relic density of the lsp .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : higgs ]",
    ", we briefly review the properties of the heavy higgs bosons . in section [ sec : ilc ] , we discuss how and how well we can study the properties of the heavy higgses at the ilc .",
    "in particular , we estimate the expected errors in the observed values of masses and widths of the heavy higgses .",
    "then , in section [ sec : cdm ] , we discuss the implication of the ilc study of the heavy higgses to the reconstruction of the dark matter density .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to the conclusions and discussion .",
    "[ sec : higgs ]    we start by discussing the higgs bosons in the mssm and by summarizing the relevant parameters for our analysis .",
    "as we mentioned , the mssm contains two higgs bosons @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 , where we have shown their quantum numbers of @xmath20 gauge group in the parenthesis .",
    "both of these higgs bosons acquire vacuum expectation values , which are parameterized by @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and the angle @xmath23 is a free parameter . after the electroweak symmetry breaking ,",
    "it is usually the case that one linear combination of @xmath16 and @xmath18 becomes the standard - model - like higgs @xmath24 while the other combination @xmath25 contains physical heavy higgs , which are given bystrictly speaking , mixing in the cp - even neutral higgs sector differs from those of other higgses , and conventionally the mixing in the cp - even neutral higgses are parameterized by the parameter @xmath26 @xcite . when the heavy higgses are much heavier than the lightest higgs ( i.e. , in the so - called `` decoupling limit '' ) , however , it is expected that @xmath27 and eq .",
    "( [ higgs_diag ] ) holds with good accuracy . in this paper",
    ", we only consider such a case . @xmath28 using the mass eigenstates @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , the heavy higgs doublet @xmath29 is expressed as @xmath30 in general two higgs models , masses of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are unconstrained . in the mssm , however ,",
    "their masses , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , are quite degenerate within a few gev or so . for the neutral higgs sector",
    ", this fact makes the study difficult . in our following study",
    ", we do not adopt the theoretical relation among these masses but we consider how well we can determine these three masses ( in particular , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) at the ilc .",
    "= 0.5    the productions of the heavy higgses at the ilc are dominated by the gauge - boson exchange diagrams . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] , we show the cross section for the processes @xmath34 and @xmath35 for several cases .",
    "( we will give the formula for the cross section in the following section ; see eqs .",
    "( [ cs_ah ] ) and ( [ cs_hchc ] ) . ) here and hereafter , in our numerical study , we assume un - polarized electron beam .    decay processes of the heavy higgses have more model - dependence . in the rapid - annihilation funnels ,",
    "heavy higgses mostly decay into the third generation quarks and leptons .",
    "we write the relevant interaction asnotice that the yukawa coupling constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are different from those in the superpotential .",
    "@xmath39 where @xmath40 @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47 , and @xmath48 @xmath49 are third - generation quarks and leptons . in the parameter region",
    "we are interested in , the ( fundamental ) yukawa coupling constants in the superpotential are fairly large .",
    "so , we expect that the radiative corrections do not significantly affect the relations between those with yukawa coupling constants of the heavy higgses .",
    "if we try to extract the information about these yukawa coupling constants from the observed fermion masses , however , radiative correction may become important . at the tree level ,",
    "the yukawa coupling constants are related to the masses of the bottom quark , top quark and @xmath50 as @xmath51 thus , once the `` bottom - quark mass '' @xmath52 is well determined by the study of , for example , the lightest higgs boson @xmath11 , then the yukawa coupling constant for @xmath50 can be also well determined at the tree level .",
    "it has been pointed out , however , that @xmath36 receives sizable radiative correction from supersymmetric loop diagrams in particular at the large @xmath1 region @xcite .",
    "thus , in determining the interaction of the heavy higgses , it is dangerous to adopt the tree level relations .    in our analysis",
    ", we assume that several qualitative features of the large @xmath1 region hold ; in particular , we consider the case where the heavy higgses decay into third generation quarks and leptons because of large @xmath36 and @xmath38 .",
    "we do not , however , rely on the tree level relations among these yukawa coupling constants but regard all the yukawa couplings ( in particular , @xmath36 and @xmath38 ) to be free parameters which should be experimentally determined .    in the large @xmath1 region , @xmath37 is extremely suppressed and , hereafter , we neglect its effects .",
    "then , the neutral higgses @xmath9 and @xmath8 decay mostly into the @xmath53 or @xmath54 final states.@xmath8 may also decay into the gauge - boson or higgs boson pair , but those processes are extremely suppressed in the large @xmath1 region that we are interested in .",
    "the decay rates of the heavy higgses are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the color factor and we neglect the masses of the fermions other than the top quark .",
    "here , we denote the qcd corrections to the individual decay processes as @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "importantly , the qcd corrections are calculable once the higgs masses are determined @xcite .",
    "thus , if we can measure the decay widths and branching ratios of the heavy higgses , we can constrain the yukawa coupling constants .",
    "in addition , the total decay width of the heavy higgses are given by @xmath59 as we will see below , in the rapid - annihilation funnels , decay widths of heavy higgses are relatively large .",
    "thus , from the invariant - mass distribution of the decay products , the decay widths may be measured at the ilc .    in summary , for the study of the heavy higgs sector in the large @xmath1 region , there are five relevant parameters so far : three masses @xmath32 ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath33 , and two yukawa coupling constants @xmath36 and @xmath38 . as we will see , the relic density of the lsp can be also well calculated in the rapid - annihilation funnels once these parameters are fixed . in the following , we will discuss how well these parameters are experimentally determined .",
    "although our method can be applied to various cases , the whole parameter space is too large to be studied .",
    "thus , we choose several parameter points and see how well we can experimentally measure parameters at the ilc in those cases . for simplicity",
    ", we generate the mass spectrum of the mssm particles by adopting the msugra boundary condition which is parameterized by the following parameters : universal scalar mass @xmath60 , unified gaugino mass @xmath61 , tri - linear coupling coefficient @xmath62 , @xmath1 , and the sign of the susy invariant higgs mass @xmath63 . although we adopt the msugra model as the underlying theory to fix the mass spectrum and mixing parameters , we consider a procedure to experimentally measure the parameters without assuming the msugra .",
    "since we are interested in the implication of such analysis to the study of the dark - matter physics , we adopt underlying parameters in the rapid - annihilation funnels . in table",
    "[ table : params ] , we list the underlying parameters which we use .",
    "( we also show the density parameter of the lsp @xmath64 with those underlying parameters . )    .underlying parameters to be used in our study . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "[ sec : ilc ]      now we discuss the study of the properties of the heavy higgs bosons at the ilc . in particular , we are primarily interested in how and how well we can constrain the five parameters listed in the previous section by combining the information from the neutral and charged higgs production processes . for this purpose ,",
    "we adopt several reasonable approximations to simplify our analysis as we explain below , instead of studying the details of individual production and decay processes .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , decay rates of the heavy higgses are sensitive to the yukawa coupling constants .",
    "thus our strategy is to study branching ratios and the energy distribution of the final - state fermions produced by the decay of the heavy higgses .",
    "since the ( total ) decay rates are much smaller than the masses of the heavy higgses , we can also measure the masses of the heavy higgses from the energy distributions of the decay products .",
    "since we will try to determine the decay rates from the energy distribution of the final - state particles , we do not use the narrow width approximation for the heavy higgs production cross section . in our analysis ,",
    "the following type of the processes play a significant role : @xmath65 where , in our case , @xmath66 is @xmath67 or @xmath68 and @xmath69 s are quarks and leptons .",
    "let us denote the invariant - mass squared of the @xmath70 system as @xmath71 .",
    "then , for the processes we are interested in , the differential cross sections are well approximated by the following formulafor the process we consider ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) , there are in fact several diagrams where some of the fermions are not emitted from the virtual higgs bosons ( like @xmath73 , followed by @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) . in the parameter region where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are both close to the higgs mass(es )",
    ", however , we have checked that the cross section is dominated by the process @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we use eq .",
    "( [ dsigma / dsds ] ) for simplicity . @xmath78 where the second term should be omitted if @xmath79 and @xmath80 are identical . here , @xmath81 is the cross section for the process @xmath82 with the masses of @xmath83 and @xmath84 being set equal to @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath85 denotes the decay rate of @xmath86 whose mass is identified as @xmath87 ; @xmath85 can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ a->bb ] ) @xmath6 ( [ hc->taunu ] ) by replacing the physical mass of the higgs by @xmath87 .",
    "explicit formulae of @xmath88 will be given in the following subsections .",
    "notice that , when @xmath89 , the total cross section becomes @xmath90 where @xmath91    as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ dsigma / dsds ] ) , the distributions of the invariant masses of the final - state fermions have peaks around @xmath92 . in addition , the distributions become broader as the decay rate @xmath93 becomes larger .",
    "thus , in the heavy higgs production processes , the invariant - mass distributions of the final state fermions have important information about the masses and the decay widths of the heavy higgses .",
    "it should be , however noted that the observed invariant - mass distributions are deformed by several effects .",
    "one reason is the energy loss by the neutrino emission . with",
    "the leptonic decays , some fraction of the initial energy of the bottom quark may be carried away by energetic neutrinos and the energy of the @xmath94-jet becomes underestimated .",
    "another important effect is from the resolution of the calorimeters ( in particular , the hadronic calorimeter ) . in order to simulate these effects",
    ", we perform a monte - carlo ( mc ) analysis . here",
    ", we first generate parton - level events for a given value of the collider energy @xmath95 , which we take to be @xmath7 throughout this paper unless otherwise mentioned . in each event , in general ,",
    "momenta of bottom quarks @xmath96 , other lighter quarks @xmath97 , and leptons @xmath98 are generated .",
    "if the final - state partons contain the top quark , its decay ( as well as the subsequent decay of @xmath99 ) is also taken into account at this state . here and hereafter , the superscript @xmath100 is for momenta of the primary partons before the hadronization and cascade decay . in order to consider the energy loss of the bottom quark in the leptonic decay events , we used isajet package @xcite to follow the hadronization and decay chain of the bottom quark . for individual primary bottom quark with ( initial ) momentum @xmath101",
    ", we calculate the fraction of the visible energy @xmath102 after its hadronization and decay .",
    "then , the @xmath94-jet ( after the hadronization and the decay ) is treated as the jet with the momentum @xmath103 .",
    "in addition , because of the detector resolution , distribution of the observed energy of the jet is smeared . in order to determine the observed momentum of the individual jets , we adopt the energy resolution of the hadronic calorimeter to be @xmath104 ( with @xmath105 being the energy of the jet ) @xcite . as a result , with the generated momenta of the quarks @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we determine the observed energy @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "( we also denote corresponding observed energy as @xmath108 and @xmath109 . )",
    "let us first consider the neutral higgs production @xmath110 . in the large @xmath1 region , @xmath9 and @xmath8 both dominantly decay into @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    ", we use the first two types of events : @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) final state and @xmath126 final state .",
    "we do not consider @xmath127 final state because the branching ratios of the heavy neutral higgses into the @xmath128 final state are fairly small ( @xmath129 ) so the number of @xmath130 events is suppressed .",
    "the branching ratios @xmath131 and @xmath132 are @xmath133 so sizable number of @xmath125 event is expected . at the ilc , such an event will be identified by the following features :    * 4 @xmath94-tagged jets .",
    "* small missing energy .",
    "* no isolated leptons .",
    "once observed , the distribution of the invariant mass of two @xmath94-jets provides important information about the properties of the heavy higgs bosons .",
    "energy and invariant - mass distributions of the primary partons are relatively easily calculated . as we mentioned in the previous subsection , however , observed distributions are different from the primary ones because of the leptonic decay of the bottom quark and also because of the resolution of the calorimeters .",
    "we are particularly interested in the distribution of the invariant mass of two @xmath94-jets which originate from ( virtual ) neutral higgs bosons . in order to pair the @xmath94-jets",
    ", we use the fact that the masses of the two ( heavy ) neutral higgses are expected to be quite degenerate .",
    "consequently , the total energy of @xmath53 system from the virtual @xmath9 becomes very close to that from the virtual @xmath8 .",
    "thus , for the event @xmath134 ( where the @xmath94-jets are ordered so that the observed energy be @xmath135 ) , we define the following two invariant masses : @xmath136 in general , we can perform statistical analysis based on the distributions of these two invariant masses . for simplicity , however , we use `` averaged '' distribution @xmath137_{m_{bb,2}=m_{bb } }    + \\frac{1}{2 }      \\int d m_{bb,2 } \\left [ \\frac{dn_{4b}}{d m_{bb,1 } d m_{bb,2 } }      \\right]_{m_{bb,1}=m_{bb } } ,    \\label{dn(4b)/dm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is the number of @xmath125 events .",

    "( [ dn(4b)/dm ] ) , we calculate the `` transfer functions '' for the @xmath125 events @xmath139 ; @xmath140 is the distribution of the observable @xmath141 for the event with @xmath142 and @xmath143 being fixed . in calculating the transfer function , several kinematical constraints are taken into account to eliminate standard - model backgrounds . in the @xmath125 events ,",
    "all the beam energy is carried away by the bottom quarks .",
