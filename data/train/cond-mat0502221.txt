    "the question of whether zero - temperature attenuation exists in the transverse spin dynamics of spin - polarized normal fermi fluids continues to attract experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "one idea@xcite is that in strongly polarized fermi fluids , the gap between the spin - up and spin - down fermi surfaces is available for scattering quasiparticles in mixed - spin states , leading to a finite transverse relaxation time @xmath3 as @xmath4 , with an anisotropy temperature @xmath2 that is of the order of the gap energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the magnetic moment and @xmath7 is the effective external magnetic field .",
    "for very dilute mixtures with _ s_-wave interactions , jeon and mullin@xcite found @xmath8 mk with currently available magnetic fields of @xmath9 tesla .",
    "several high @xmath10 spin - echo experiments have been performed to observe zero - temperature attenuation in pure @xmath0he and dense @xmath0he-@xmath1he solutions @xmath11 , which have degenerate temperature regimes that are accessible with dilution refrigeration .",
    "measurements of the anisotropy temperature have thus far yielded @xmath2(@xmath12 t , @xmath13)@xmath14 mk , @xmath2(@xmath12 t , @xmath15)@xmath16 mk , and @xmath2(@xmath12 t , @xmath17)=1@xmath18mk,@xcite @xmath2(@xmath19 t , pure)@xmath20",
    "mk,@xcite @xmath2(@xmath21 t , @xmath22)@xmath16mk@xcite and @xmath2(@xmath21 t , pure)@xmath23.@xcite although the experimental evidence for zero temperature attenuation is convincing , the measured values of @xmath2 seem rather high compared to the dilute limit prediction , and more puzzling , are not proportional to the magnetic field .    on the other hand",
    ", fomin@xcite argues that when the ground state of a polarized system is properly defined , the quasi - particles between the fermi surfaces are not excitations and do not scatter . he has derived a spin wave dispersion relation at @xmath24 which contains no damping up to second order in the wave vector . a recent cw experiment@xcite to measure the damping of spin - wave modes ( @xmath25 tip ) in a saturated 9.4% @xmath0he-@xmath1he solution at 7 bar showed no evidence of spin diffusion anisotropy , supporting fomin s prediction that @xmath26 .",
    "thus the existence of zero temperature attenuation is still a somewhat open question .    in hope of clarifying the situation ,",
    "spin - echo experiments are being performed at the high @xmath10 facility at nhmfl ( @xmath27 t and @xmath28mk ) with very low concentrations to test the dilute limit prediction of jeon and mullin . at this high value of @xmath10",
    "the spin rotation parameter is expected to be very large @xmath29 . under these conditions",
    "special care must be taken to avoid experimental defects that might mimic or mask zero - temperature attenuation such as joule heating , boundary effects , instabilities , and inhomogeneous demagnetization fields .",
    "below we describe another effect which can mimic zero - temperature attenuation .    in a @xmath30 spin echo experiment",
    "the initially uniform equilibrium magnetization is tipped out of thermal equilibrium by a @xmath31 pulse .",
    "because of the field gradient , the transverse components of the magnetization mix until , at a time @xmath32 , the magnetization becomes uniform with polarization @xmath33 .",
    "note that the system is still out of equilibrium with @xmath7 , which , for times much less than the longitudinal relaxation time @xmath34 , has no effect on the nonequilibrium dynamics other than an overall larmor precession .    as the nonuniformities in the magnetization mix , the ( non - equilibrium ) temperature of the momentum distribution increases .",
    "the temperature increase occurs as the mixed - spin states between the fermi surfaces of the polarized @xmath0he gas scatter and are converted into thermal excitations near the spin - up and spin - down fermi surfaces .",
    "the thermodynamics of this irreversible process have been analyzed previously in a study of the polarization dependence of the viscosity in @xmath0he.@xcite note that at these low temperatures ( @xmath35 mk ) , the specific heat of the background @xmath1he is negligible compared to the @xmath0he gas.@xcite    a simple example illustrates the effect . consider two @xmath24 fermi distributions , one unpolarized and one completely polarized .",
    "the polarized distribution has a fermi momentum that is @xmath36 times greater than the unpolarized distribution , and a total kinetic energy which is @xmath37 times greater .",
    "if the polarized distribution is tipped by @xmath38 and allowed to relax by diffusion in a field gradient , its temperature must increase from @xmath24 to @xmath39 since the total kinetic energy is conserved .",
    "for a small tip angles , the effect is smaller since the effect of the spin - echo experiment on the polarization is @xmath40 .    in the following ,",
    "we calculate the temperature increase for various tipping angles , initial temperatures and concentrations , with special attention paid to the nhmfl experiments .",
    "we also estimate the size of the effect in past measurements of the anisotropy temperature .",
    "consider a polarized ideal fermi gas in thermal equilibrium with a magnetic field @xmath7 . so that the following applies to the nhmfl experiments",
    ", we shall assume @xmath27 t , @xmath41 mk , and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 mk ) .",
    "the explicit formulas for the normalized particle densities are ,     mk , @xmath27 t , and @xmath44 . ,",
    "height=240 ]    n_= _ 0^ [ dist ]     tip angle .",
    "the dotted line is the initial temperature.,height=240 ]    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . solving for the chemical potential numerically ,",
    "we find @xmath49 and a polarization @xmath50 . the kinetic energy of the @xmath0he distribution is calculated from    ke / ke_f= _ 0^(+)x^4dx [ energy ] during a spin - echo experiment the system is out of equilibrium with the magnetic field , we may remove the zeeman energy term in the exponentials and introduce two nonequilibrium chemical potentials . in order to calculate the temperature increase , we re - solve eqs.[dist]-[energy ] for @xmath51 and @xmath52 with the initial kinetic energy but with @xmath53 .",
    "the resulting temperature increase is shown in fig.1 as a function of the tip angle . for small",
    "tip angles the effect is small : for tip angles of @xmath54 the temperature increases from an initial temperature of 2 mk to final temperatures of @xmath55 mk .",
    "however , the final temperature increases rapidly with increasing tip angle to a maximum of 6.5 mk for a @xmath38 tip .    in fig.2 the final temperature is plotted as a function of the initial temperature for a @xmath56 tip angle .",
    "since the diffusion coefficient and @xmath57 vary like @xmath58 without zero - temperature attenuation , we also plot @xmath59 in the inset .",
    "one can see that the temperature increase could mimic anisotropy effects , with an apparent anisotropy temperature of 0.75 mk .",
    "this , however , is much lower than the expected anisotropy temperature of 3.8 mk for 15 t.    for a given temperature and field strength the effect in @xmath0he-@xmath1he solutions is nearly independent of concentration ( the calculations are not presented here ) . on the other hand , for pure @xmath0he the effect is larger because the polarization is enhanced by the factor @xmath60 . in previous spin - echo experiments with pure @xmath0he and magnetic fields of 8 t@xcite and 11.3 t @xcite ,",
    "the temperature increases were from initial temperatures of 4 mk and 2.5 mk to final temperatures of 4.57 mk , and 3.5 mk , repectively , which are both consistent with an apparent anisotropy temperature of @xmath61 2 mk . in both cases",
    "the temperature increase was not large enough to mimic the observed anisotropy temperatures of 13 - 16 mk , but the increase certainly shifted the observed @xmath2 upward . for previous experiments in @xmath0he-@xmath1he solutions",
    "the effect is hardly noticeable .",
    "next , we consider the effect that the temperature increase has on the spin- echo data and the resulting measurements of @xmath62 and @xmath57 .    .",
    "the dotted line results when the temperature increase is included . ,",
    "height=240 ]    if the time to restore thermal equilibrium in the momentum distribution @xmath63 is small compared to the diffusion time @xmath64 , then in computer simulations the distribution can treated as having an instantaneous temperature @xmath65 $ ] during the spin - echo experiment . when the temperature increase is small compared to the anisotropy temperature @xmath2 , the effect on the spin echo data is barely noticeable .",
    "however , if fomin is correct and @xmath26 the temperature increase can mimic the effects of zero temperature attenuation . to illustrate this , fig.3 shows the effect of the temperature increase on the calculated spin echo heights for @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 mk as in the nhmfl experiment , with @xmath69 mk and @xmath26 . since the temperature increase develops after a time @xmath70 the initial slope of the @xmath71 vs. @xmath72",
    "is unaffected .",
    "within typical experimental error bars the echo height curve still appears linear , but with an somewhat increased slope .",
    "the slope , which is proportional to @xmath73 , is increased since the temperature increase reduces both @xmath62 and @xmath57 by the same factor . by similar arguments ,",
    "the phase of the echo ( not shown ) is unaffected .",
    "when the echo height and phase data are fitted to lines , the resulting values of @xmath62 and @xmath57 are reduced by 13% , which is consistent with the ( false ) anisotropy temperature of @xmath74 mk shown in fig.2 .    from these calculations of the temperature increase , we can eliminate this effect as the explanation for the observation of anisotropy temperatures in previous spin - echo experiments , although this effect will become increasingly important at higher values of @xmath10 .",
