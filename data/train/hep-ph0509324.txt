    "it was shown that the measured momentum anisotropy parameter @xmath2 at rhic energy can be well described by ideal hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the quark - gluon matter produced seems to behave like a perfect fluid which represents a strongly interacting and thus locally thermal system . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial situation of the quark - gluon system is far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is therefore important to understand how and which partonic interactions can thermalize the system within a short timescale .",
    "a convenient way to study thermalization of particles is to carry out microscopical transport simulations which , however , need large computational power .",
    "there are several such numerical realizations @xcite currently applied for investigating the space time evolution of partons . in these models",
    "only elastic @xmath3 interactions are considered and no thermal equilibrium can be realized in au+au collision at rhic when using reasonable pqcd cross sections .",
    "it is thus essential to study the contribution of multiple interactions to the thermal equilibration .",
    "in addition , the possible importance of the inelastic scatterings on thermalization was raised in the `` bottom up thermalization '' picture @xcite .",
    "recently we have developed a new @xmath4 dimensional monte carlo cascade solving the kinetic on - shell boltzmann equations for partons including inelastic @xmath0 pqcd processes @xcite .",
    "detailed balance is fulfilled in a consistant manner .",
    "the three - body gluonic interactions are described by the matrix element @xcite @xmath5 } \\right ) \\theta(k_{\\perp}\\lambda_g-\\cosh y ) \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 . @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote , respectively , the perpendicular component of the momentum transfer and that of the momentum of the radiated gluon in the c.m .",
    "frame of the collision .",
    "we regularize the infrared divergences by using the debye screening mass @xmath9 which is calculated locally over the actual particle density obtained from the simulation . the suppression of the radiation of soft gluons due to the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect , which is expressed via the step function in eq .",
    "( [ m23 ] ) , is modeled by the consideration that the time of the emission , @xmath10 , should be smaller than the time interval between two scatterings or equivalently the gluon mean free path @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to a lower cutoff of @xmath12 and to an effective increase of the collision angles .    until now only gluonic dynamics",
    "is considered in the cascade . in the future quarks will be included .",
    "a special interest is put on the investigation of elliptic flow of heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "the production of the primary partons at the very onset of a heavy ion collision is based on the picture of a free superposition of minijets being liberated in the individual semihard nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "minijets denote here on - shell partons with transverse momentum being greater than a certain cutoff @xmath13 .",
    "their production is controlled by perturbative qcd for sufficient high @xmath13 @xcite . on the other side , the smaller the cutoff @xmath13 is , the denser will be the initial minijet system , which may accelerate thermalization .",
    "phenomenologically the cutoff @xmath13 can be chosen in a way to fit the ( final ) @xmath14 as seen in experiment .",
    "the space time configuration of the produced partons will be determined by applying the glauber symmetry with a woods - saxon nuclear distribution .",
    "we have also considered the conditions of the initial partons according to color glass condensate @xcite .",
    "first results can be found in @xcite .",
    "to study possible thermalization of gluons we concentrate on the local central region which is taken as an expanding cylinder with a radius of @xmath15 fm and within a unit interval of space time rapidity @xmath16 around the collision center @xmath17 . figure [ dndpt ] shows the varying transverse momentum spectrum with time obtained in the central region .",
    "the bold - faced histogram with a lower cutoff at @xmath18 gev ( a very conservative setting ) denotes the spectrum of the primary gluons ( or minijets ) . in the simulation",
    "including inelastic @xmath0 scatterings ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ dndpt ] ) the curves from second upper to lowest depict , respectively , the spectrum at @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 fm / c .",
    "we see that the spectrum reaches an exponential shape at 2 fm / c and becomes increasingly steeper at late times .",
    "this is a clear indication for the achievement of thermal equilibrium and the onset of hydrodynamical evolution . in contrast , without including inelastic collisions ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ dndpt ] ) one has no hints for equilibration .          while @xmath26 is significantly larger than @xmath27 , its transport cross section is smaller than that of typical @xmath28 collision . inspecting the fraction of the transport cross sections to the total cross sections we realize that the distribution of the collision angle in @xmath28 processes is almost isotropic , while the @xmath29 collisions are much more forward peaked . taking the contribution of @xmath30 collision to the equilibration into account , the total inelastic interactions are the dominant processes compared to the elastic collisions . besides the kinetic scatterings plasma instabilities of the gluon field may also have contribution to a very early and fast momentum equilibration @xcite .",
    "the latter should be further quantified .",
    "we have also performed simulations when the momentum cutoff for the initial minijets is taken smaller .",
    "it turns out that for the more dense system at @xmath31 gev ( being in line with the measured @xmath14 ) the full equilibrium comes slightly sooner at @xmath32 fm / c .",
    "the timescale tends to saturate at smaller @xmath13 .",
    "these results will be presented in a sequent paper .",
    "taking @xmath33 gev for the initial minijets we simulate the parton evolution for noncentral collisions at rhic energy in order to calculate the elliptic flow parameter @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ v2 ] shows the time evolution of @xmath2 extracted in the central rapidity for various impact parameter @xmath25 .",
    "these calculations are still preliminary and no exhaustive tests have been finished .",
    "we see that @xmath2 increases with time and saturates at late times , @xmath34 fm / c . the larger the initial space anisotropy is , the larger is the generated @xmath2 .",
    "the results give us strong indication that an early pressure is being built up .",
    "the symbols in fig .",
    "[ v2 ] mark the time from which the energy density in the central region decreases below 1 @xmath35 .",
    "therefore after this time the system can be hardly described by the dynamics among partons .",
    "if we take the @xmath2 values at the marked times as the contribution from the partonic phase , one realizes that they lie well in the region covered by the experimental data with the systematic errors @xcite",
