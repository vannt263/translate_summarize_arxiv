    "let under rescaling @xmath74 @xmath75 hence the structure factor scales as @xmath76 .",
    "the choice of @xmath77 ensures that @xmath78 at the @xmath79 fixed point , the hamiltonian is not scale invariant , but has a non - zero scaling dimension @xmath80 : @xmath81 .",
    "after rescaling the langevin equation reads @xmath82 where the new noise @xmath83 and the noise correlator @xmath84 .",

    "the scale dependence of temperature @xmath87 appears essentially as the coarse - grained langevin equation has been rewritten in the form ( [ coarse ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is dominated by the @xmath88 term .",
    "one can construct the porod law @xcite for this problem which tells us @xmath89 the energy density @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the uv cutoff .",
    "it is obvious that for large @xmath0 , @xmath93 . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the dominant contribution comes from @xmath95 ( which is the lower cut off or the system size ) hence , for @xmath1 , @xmath96 ; @xmath97 , @xmath98 and for @xmath6 , @xmath99 . for @xmath100 , @xmath93 and in addition to",
    "that there is an additional logarithm factor .",
    "thus for @xmath1 we substitute @xmath96 and obtain @xmath101 under coarse graining in the free theory @xmath27 change only under rescaling : since @xmath102 in the free theory @xmath103 .",
    "the nonlinear term becomes important when @xmath104 the interface thickness ; in that regime @xmath27 reaches its fixed point value @xmath105 which can be determined by matching with the value in the free theory ( when @xmath106 ) @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath107 ( @xmath108 is measured in units of the lattice spacing ) .",
    "we now argue this ( which in turn suggests @xmath102 ) is consistent with the more conventional dynamical scaling at the critical point @xmath109 . at @xmath110 the domain length @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the surface tension and @xmath113 is the magnetisation ( see @xcite for the corresponding ising case ) .",
    "thus for @xmath102 we have @xmath114 . here",
    "@xmath112 , @xmath27 etc .",
    "are functions of @xmath87 . in the critical region , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the correlation length ,",
    "@xmath117 is the anomalous dimension and @xmath118 is the critical dynamical exponent of ncop .",
    "also the interfacial thickness @xmath119 . substituting we find @xmath120 which is consistent with the conventional dynamical scaling @xcite .",
    "this provides justification of @xmath102 and the existence of another length scale @xmath108 in the problem .",
    "this can also be seen in an allen - cahn type approach for this model ( similar to ref.@xcite for an ncop in the ising model ) : we get for a flat equilibrium profile @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the coordinate normal to the interface . also , noting @xmath123 and by using the equation for the equilibrium profile , we find @xmath124 where we have neglected terms containing higher order derivatives of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath122 for gently curving walls . here",
    "@xmath125 is a unit vector normal to the wall ( in the direction for increasing @xmath16 ) .",
    "since @xmath126 is just the wall velocity @xmath127 we get @xmath128 which is the analogue of the allen - cahn equation for this model .",
    "@xmath129 is the laplacian of the mean curvature . since for a single characteristic length @xmath95 , velocity @xmath130 and @xmath131 giving @xmath132 for non - conserved scalar order parameter .",
    "so we find @xmath102 same as predicted by the rg analysis .    for @xmath133 , i.e. , for vector order parameters , the hamiltonian renormalises as a free theory but eventually flows to the strong - coupling fixed point characterised by @xmath134 , which eliminates one degree of freedom from the problem but the remaining ones still renormalise as free fields suggesting that @xmath27 changes only due to rescaling .",
    "the analogue of eq.([scalscale ] ) for a vector order parameter is @xmath135 here @xmath136 is the large scale spin stiffness and @xmath137 in the critical region . thus we find , for a vector order parameter @xmath138 which is again consistent with the conventional dynamical scaling .",
    "so we see @xmath102 for both @xmath97 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath100 case is interesting due to an extra logarithm : @xmath139 $ ] , similar to the @xmath97 case of non - conserved landau - ginzburg theory .",
    "however , rg can not detect that .    it is easy to extend the large-@xmath0 method to the @xmath9 lifshitz point :",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath140 @xmath52 being the same as in eq.([nclarge ] ) . neglecting @xmath141 ( like the previous case ) ,",
    "we get @xmath142 giving @xmath143\\ln t$ ] .",
    "hence the structure factor scales as @xmath144 we see that there are two _ dynamic exponents _ @xmath145 and @xmath146 for the parallel and the perpendicular directions respectively , which follows easily from the form of the bare propagator for the equation of motion for the @xmath9 lifshitz point is @xmath147 this can be written in a scaling form @xmath148 .",
    "the existence of two _ dynamic exponents _ is clear from this form .",
    "the nonlinear terms in the long time limit only modify the scaling form keeping the dynamic exponents same ( within this self - consistent calculation ) . the results above",
    "immediately yield surprising results for @xmath8 : as before we find @xmath149.\\ ] ] thus the two - time correlator scales as @xmath150.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we identify two @xmath151 : @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "so in presence of anisotropy , like the dynamic exponents , one finds two two - time correlation exponents .",
    "again it is important to find out how @xmath71 corrections may affect the effects of anisotropy on the @xmath8-exponents .",
    "folk and selke @xcite studied the relaxation near the lifshitz point .",
    "they characterised relaxation rate by two exponents : a single dynamic exponent @xmath7 and a second exponent @xmath154 which characterises spatial anisotropy .",
    "our eq.([ncopfinal ] ) can also be written in terms a single dynamic exponent @xmath7 and a new exponent @xmath154 : @xmath155\\nonumber \\\\ & = & t^{(d - m)/z+m/(xz)}\\exp[-2k_{\\parallel}^zt ( 1+k_{perp}^x / k_{\\parallel})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "thus our results agree with the scaling form at the lifshitz point .",
    "having considered the simpler case of quench of the nonconserved order parameter , we now go over to the more interesting case of conserved order parameter .",
    "we first work out the @xmath24 lifshitz point using the large-@xmath0 method : in the large-@xmath0 limit the equation of motion in fourier space becomes @xcite @xmath158\\phi.\\ ] ] the solution of this is @xmath159.\\ ] ] as usual , @xmath160 .",
    "we solve for @xmath64 self - consistently .",
    "using the solution of the equation of motion we have @xmath161.$ ] neglecting @xmath52 in comparison with 1 ( which we jusitify _ aposteriori _ ) , @xmath162,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath163 and @xmath164 . evaluating the above integral by using steepest descent method we obtain @xmath165 , ( @xmath59 is a constant ) in the long time limit .",
    "so the asymptotic form of the structure factor is @xmath166 where @xmath167 . now",
    "@xmath168 as @xmath67 .",
    "thus there are two time scales present in @xmath40 , separated by @xmath169 ; in other words this form , instead of simple scaling , exhibits multiscaling similar to the quench of conserved ordinary ising order parameter @xcite .",
    "following @xcite it is easy to show that the equal time correlation function @xmath170 satisfy the equation @xmath171 equation ( [ finn ] ) is similar to that in ref.@xcite .",
    "this however is not correct to @xmath71 as pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "this can be derived by using the gaussian auxiliary field method of mazenko @xcite . for @xmath172 ,",
    "the @xmath173 term can be ignored and the resulting equation exhibits temporal multiscaling . for finite @xmath0",
    "we start with a scaling form consistent with @xmath174 growth law , i.e. , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the fourier transform of @xmath178 and @xmath179 is a constant . substituting these in eq.([finn ] )",
    "gives @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the fourier transform of @xmath182 .",
    "we have @xmath183 for a conserve order parameter .",
    "we have the constraint @xmath184 , i.e. , @xmath185 to fix @xmath179 @xcite . for large @xmath0",
    "we find that @xmath186 which diverges with @xmath0 .",
    "this defines a lengthscale @xmath187 .",
    "thus , as in the ising case , our approximate analysis gives consistent scaling solutions .",
    "so we do not find any temporal multiscaling for finite ( but large ) @xmath0 .",
    "fourier transform of @xmath178 gives the scaling function @xmath177 .",
    "recently , in a series of papers castellano _ et al _ @xcite discussed preasymptotic multiscaling and eventual crossover to simple scaling in the asymptotic limit for the cop of the ising model .",
    "they showed that there are competitions between terms representing multiscaling and simple scaling respectively ; and consequently they found a crossover time scale beyond which simple scaling is recovered .",
    "analogous analysis on eq.([finn ] ) reveals similar features .",
    "in a rg set up for cop , @xmath27 should be replaced by @xmath188 in the equation of motion that we used while discussing the rg arguments for the nonconserved order parameter .",
    "after suitable coarse graining and rescaling of variables , the equation of motion reads ( under rescaling @xmath189 ) @xmath190 while the new noise correlator is given by @xmath191 as usual the temperature scales as @xmath192 . since the noise correlator is singular in the @xmath193 limit , no new term can be generated by integrating out the short wavelength fluctuations which is at least as singular as the bare correlator @xcite .",
    "hence in the long wavelength limit , the bare correlator dominates and consequently we claim that @xmath194 can change only under rescaling .",
    "we write the recursion relation for @xmath194 : @xmath195 provided @xmath194 is nonzero at the fixed point , we have @xmath196 where we used @xmath197 . as before we have ( from porod law ; see previous sec . )",
    "@xmath96 for @xmath1 , @xmath98 for @xmath97 , @xmath99 for @xmath6 and @xmath93 for @xmath198 .",
    "plugging in these values we get @xmath199 for scalar order parameter ( _ lifshitz - slyzov _",
    "law for this model ) , @xmath102 for @xmath97 component case , @xmath200 for @xmath6 and @xmath201 for the large-@xmath0 case .",
    "for @xmath100 there is additional logarithm in the form : @xmath202 $ ] ; our rg treatment can not see this extra logarithm .",
    "it is surprising that we find @xmath7 for the ordering of non - conserved dynamics of the scalar order parameter ( @xmath1 ) higher than that in the conserved dymamics , as normally conservation law is expected to slow down the dynamics .",
    "since rg for ncop is not exact it is difficult to interpret this surprising result .",
    "numerical simulations are required to settle this .",
    "we now show a simple argument leads to the @xmath203 growth for the @xmath1 scalar conserve order parameter ( cop ) .",
    "the diffusion current @xmath204 with @xmath205 being the chemical potential difference between the two species . if there is only one scale @xmath206 at large times then @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the change in @xmath205 . near coexistence , the free enery difference is of order @xmath209 ( where @xmath16 is the magnitude of the order parameter in either of the phases ) . since in the nucleation of ncop , there is a critical length scale set by @xmath210 the surface - energy and the free energy difference @xmath211 : @xmath212 .",
    "thus we get @xmath213 .",
    "since @xmath214 we have @xmath215 this gives @xmath216 at long times , which is the analogue of the _ lifshitz - slyzov _",
    "law for this model .",
    "this prediction is in accordance with our rg result above .",
    "we extend a simple argument due to j. das and m. rao @xcite to study the effects of the mode - coupling terms on the ordering dynamics . in presence of a mode - coupling term , the eq .",
    "of motion with the free energy ( [ free ] ) is @xmath217 notice that the precisional term involves @xmath218 instead of @xmath219 as in the precisional dynamics of heisenberg ferromagnet .",

    "it is easy to see that beyond a crossover time given by @xmath224 dynamics crosses over from @xmath200 to @xmath102 .",
