    "during the past two years , we have been theoretically  and experimentally investigating coherent backscattering ( cbs ) of near - resonant light in a sample of cold rubidium atoms @xcite .",
    "cbs is an interference effect in the multiple scattering regime of propagation inside random media , yielding an enhancement of the backscattered light intensity @xcite .",
    "this interference is very robust and can be destroyed only by a few mechanisms , including faraday rotation @xcite and dynamical effects @xcite . in the particular case of atomic scatterers , we have shown that  the existence of an internal zeeman structure significantly degrades the cbs interference @xcite .",
    "the breakdown of cbs due to the faraday effect in classical samples has been recently observed and studied in details @xcite , in a situation where the scatterers are embedded in a faraday - active matrix .",
    "we are currently exploring the behavior of cbs when a magnetic field is applied to the cold atomic cloud .",
    "since the faraday effect is expected to be large even at weak applied fields ( of the order of @xmath1 @xmath2 t ) , it seems relevant to evaluate its magnitude in the particular regime of near - resonant excitation .    the faraday effect , i.e. the rotation of polarization experienced by light propagating inside a medium along an applied magnetic field , is a well - known phenomenon @xcite .",
    "faraday glass - based optical insulators are widely used in laser experiments to avoid unwanted optical feedback .",
    "due to the presence of well - defined lines ( strong resonances ) , the faraday effect is potentially strong in atomic systems , and has been extensively studied in hot vapors @xcite .",
    "in addition , light can modify the atomic gas as it propagates and induce alignment or orientation  via optical pumping , yielding various non - linear effects @xcite",
    ". however , our experiment is quite insensitive to these effects and the scope of this paper will only be the linear ,  standard  faraday rotation .",
    "even though laser - cooled atomic vapors appear interesting due to suppression of doppler broadening and collisions , few experiments on cold atoms are , to our knowledge , reported in the litterature @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we expose a simple formalism to understand the main characteristics of optical activity in an atomic system .",
    "this model , adapted to the atomic structure of rb , will be used in the quantitative analysis of the experimental results .",
    "we also briefly recall in this section the principles of the stokes analysis of a polarization state . the experimental setup and procedure",
    "are described in section 3 .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 , and compared to the model .",
    "let us consider a gas of two - level atoms excited by a near - resonant monochromatic light field of frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the induced electric dipole has a component in phase with the excitation , which corresponds to the real part of the succeptibility of the atomic medium ( with a dispersive behavior ) , and a component in quadrature , which corresponds to the imaginary part of the succeptibility ( absorptive behavior ) .",
    "the former thus relates to the refractive index of the gas , while the later corresponds to the absorption or scattering . at low light intensity @xmath4",
    "mw/@xmath7  is the saturation intensity for rubidium ) , the refractive index @xmath8 of a dilute gas is given by :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the atomic  gas density , k @xmath11 the light wave number in vacuum , @xmath12 = @xmath13 the light detuning , and @xmath14  the natural width ( @xmath15 mhz for rb ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary part of the succeptibility yields the atomic scattering cross - section @xmath16 : @xmath17 with the usual lorentzian line shape .",
    "this term will result in an attenuation exp@xmath18 of the incident light as it propagates over a distance @xmath19 inside the medium ; the quantity @xmath20 is the optical thickness of the atomic sample .",
    "we thus see that the wave will experience both a phase shift and an attenuation as it propagates .",
    "let us now consider a j @xmath21 j@xmath22 transition excited by a linearly polarized light field . a magnetic field *",
    "b * is applied along the wavector * k * , whose direction is taken as the quantization axis . the magnetic field displaces the resonance frequencies of the excited state zeeman sublevels of magnetic number @xmath23 by an amount @xmath24 , where @xmath25 mhz / g .",
    "the incident linearly - polarized light decomposes as the sum of @xmath26 and @xmath27waves of equal amplitudes , which couple the unshifted ground state to excited state sublevels of magnetic number @xmath28 respectively .",
    "these waves thus propagate in media with different refractive indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 and scattering cross - sections @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and experience different phase shifts and attenuations . if , in a first step , we neglect the absorption term , the two transmitted waves recombine in a linearly - polarized wave , rotated by an angle @xmath31 .",
    "this is the faraday rotation angle . at small magnetic field @xmath32 ,",
    "the rotation angle is simply : @xmath33 .",
    "thus , at small @xmath34 , the faraday angle is simply the optical thickness @xmath35 times the zeeman shift expressed in units of the natural width @xmath36 ( however , the proportionality between @xmath37 and @xmath35 remains valid for arbitrary magnetic field ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that , in atomic vapors , the faraday effect is very strong compared to that of standard faraday materials ( like faraday glasses ) , due to the high sensitivity of atomic energy levels to magnetic field : for a density @xmath3810@xmath39 @xmath40 , the verdet constant is @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , more than four orders of magnitude above that of typical  faraday glasses .",
    "however , for cold atomic gases , the linear increase of rotation angle with magnetic field is restricted to a small field range of a few gauss ( the zeeman splitting must remain smaller than the natural width ) , above which the faraday effect decreases .    of course",
    ", in the regime of near - resonant excitation we are dealing with , one usually can not neglect absorption .",
    "the different attenuations for the @xmath43 and @xmath27 components cause a deformation of the transmitted polarization as well as rotation .",
    "the polarization thus becomes elliptic with an ellipticity ( ratio of small to large axis ) determined by the differential absorption between @xmath26 and @xmath27 light.this effect is known as circular dichroism .",
    "the angle @xmath37 is then the angle between the initial polarization and the large axis of the transmitted ellipse .",
    "we will see how the stokes analysis allows to extract @xmath37 and the ellipticity from the measurements .",
    "although the simple picture developed above gives access to the main mechanisms of optical activity in a an atomic gas , it does not  accurately describe the f @xmath44f@xmath45 transition of the d2 line of rb@xmath46 used in this experiment . to expand the description to the case of a ground state zeeman structure",
    ", we will make the simplifying assumption that all the transitions between different ground state zeeman sublevels are independent .",
    "we thus neglect optical pumping and coherences . the refractive index for , say , @xmath26 light",
    ", then writes as @xmath47p@xmath48 , where the p@xmath49 are the ground state sublevels populations , the @xmath50 the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the various @xmath26 transitions , and the @xmath51 the refractive indices for the zeeman - shifted transitions ( a transition from a ground state of magnetic number @xmath52 to an excited state @xmath53 is frequency - shifted by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the land factors for the f @xmath57f@xmath45 transition of the d2 line of rb@xmath46 ) .",
    "we can express in the same way the total scattering cross - section for each circular polarization . in the absence of magnetic field and assuming a uniform population distribution among the ground state sublevels , the total scattering cross - section on resonance is @xmath58 , the 0.43 prefactor being the average of the squared clebsch - gordan coefficient ( or the degeneracy factor of the transition @xmath59 ) .    as discussed above",
    ", the polarization of the transmitted light can differ from the incident linear polarization .",
    "it is thus necessary to fully characterize the polarization state of the transmitted light .",
    "this can be done using the stokes formalism @xcite .",
    "four quantities need to be measured : the ( linear ) component of the transmitted light parallel to the incident polarization ( @xmath60 ) , the ( linear ) orthogonal component ( @xmath61 ) , the ( linear ) component at 45@xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , and one of the two circular components ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the sum of the first two is the total intensity @xmath65 ; the three other stokes parameters are : @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "one can then compute the three quantities which characterize any polarization state :    @xmath69    here , @xmath70 is the degree of polarization of the light , i.e. the ratio of the intensities of the polarized component to the unpolarized one ( a pure polarization state yields @xmath71 while @xmath72 corresponds to totally unpolarized light ) .",
    "even though we would not _ a priori _ expect any unpolarized component , we will see that this analysis is indeed necessary in our case .",
    "the quantity @xmath73 is the ellipticity of the polarized component ( @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath35 are the small and large axis of the ellipse respectively and the + or - sign denotes the sense of rotation of the electric field ) .",
    "the faraday angle @xmath37 is the angle between the large axis of the ellipse and the direction of the incident polarization .",
    "the experimental setup , essentially the same as in our coherent backscattering experiment , is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) is loaded from a dilute rb@xmath46 vapor ( p @xmath76 mbar ) using six laser beams ( diameter 2.8 cm , power 30 mw ) , two - by - two counter - propagating and tuned to the red of the f@xmath77f@xmath45 of the rb@xmath46 d2 line ( wavelength @xmath78 nm ) .",
    "the applied magnetic field gradient is typically 10 g / cm . during the experiment , the mot ( trapping beams , repumper , and magnetic field gradient ) is continuously turned on and off .",
    "the  dark ",
    "period is short enough ( 8 ms ) so that the cold atoms do not leave the capture volume and are recaptured during the next  bright  period ( duration 20 ms ) .    to characterize the cold atomic cloud",
    ", we measure its optical thickness as described in the next subsection . the shape and size of the cloud",
    "is recorded in 3d using fluorescence imaging , by illuminating the sample with a laser beam detuned by several @xmath36 .",
    "we use a time - of - flight technique to measure the atom s @xmath79 velocity , typically 10 cm / s .",
    "the atomic cloud contains typically @xmath80atoms with a quasi - gaussian spatial distribution @xmath81 5 mm fwhm ( on average , the cloud being usually slightly cigar - shaped ) , yielding a peak density of @xmath82 @xmath40 .",
    "the laser probe used for transmission measurements lies in the horizontal plane containing 4 of the trapping beams , at an angle of 25@xmath62 .",
    "it is produced by a 50 mw sdl diode laser injected by a yokogawa dbr diode laser , whose linewidth is 2 - 3 mhz fwhm as estimated from the beatnote between 2 identical diodes .",
    "this laser is passed through a fabry - perot cavity ( transmission peak fwhm 10 mhz ) before being sent through the atomic cloud .",
    "although this filtering does not significantly reduce the linewidth of the laser , it strongly suppresses the spectral components in the wings of the initial lineshape which limit the accuracy of the transmission measurement .",
    "the frequency of the probe can be scanned in a controlled way by @xmath83 mhz around the @xmath84 transition of the d2 line .",
    "the probe beam diameter is 1 - 2 mm , and its polarization is linear ( vertical ) .",
    "the power in the probe is typically 0.1 @xmath85 , yielding a saturation parameter s @xmath86 .",
    "it is turned on for 2 ms ( yielding a maximum of about 80 photons exchanged per atoms ) , typically 5 ms after the mot is switched off .",
    "the transmitted beam is detected by a photodiode after a rough spatial mode selection by two diaphragms of diameter 3 mm , distant of 1 m. the optical thickness measurement is performed without applied magnetic field . as we emphasized in @xcite , simply measuring the on - resonance transmission yields a strongly biased estimate for the optical thickness @xmath35 , due to the off - resonant components in the probe laser s spectrum . to overcome this problem , one solution is to scan the laser detuning @xmath12 and record the transmission line shape .",
    "we describe this curve as the convolution product of the transmission line for a purely monochromatic laser t@xmath87 with the laser line shape .",
    "if the later is known , one can extract the optical thickness from the transmission data ( for instance from the fwhm of the transmission curve ) .",
    "this method is quite accurate for large values of @xmath35 , where the width of the transmission curve is only weakly dependent on the laser s linewidth . for small values of  @xmath35 ,",
    "measuring the transmission at @xmath88 is more accurate but still requires some knowledge of the probe laser s spectrum .",
    "when working with dense atomic clouds at non - zero detuning , one should also keep in mind the possible influence of  lensing  effect ( focussing or deflection of the transmitted beam ) , due to the spatially - inhomogeneous refractive index of the sample . in our case ,",
    "the rather large cloud size ( @xmath89 mm ) and moderate density ( @xmath82 @xmath40 ) yield a large focal length of about 25 m for the cloud , and a small ( but still measurable ) lensing effect .    using the measured size of the cloud and assuming a uniform population distribution in the ground state , we",
    "can then obtain the peak atomic density and the number of atoms in the sample .",
    "the maximal optical thickness measured in our trap is @xmath90 ( yielding a fwhm for the transmission curve @xmath91 ) .",
    "as mentioned in section 2 , the stokes analysis relies on four transmission measurements . to perform the polarization measurement ,",
    "we insert a polarimeter in the path of the transmitted beam , as shown in fig.@xmath1 .",
    "it consists of a quarter - wave plate ( only used for the circular component ) , a half - wave plate and a glan prism polarizer ( fixed ) .",
    "the rejection factor of the polarizer is @xmath92 .",
    "the four transmission signals ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) are recorded as a function of the laser detuning .",
    "the degree of polarization , ellipticity and rotation angle can then be computed using expressions ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) .",
    "fig.@xmath93 shows a typical example of the raw signals obtained in the four polarization channels necessary for the stokes analysis detailed in sec.@xmath93 .",
    "the transmitted intensity is recorded as a function of the detuning ( expressed in units of @xmath36 ) in the parallel ( * a * ) , orthogonal ( * b * ) , 45@xmath62 ( * c * ) and circular ( * d * ) polarization channels .",
    "all curves have been scaled by the incident intensity .",
    "these data were obtained for a sample of optical thickness @xmath94 and an applied magnetic field @xmath95 = 3 g .",
    "we see on curve ( * b * ) that more than 10% of the incident light is transferred to the orthogonal channel . on curves ( * c * ) and ( * d * ) ,",
    "the off - resonant detected intensities are close to 0.5 , since the incident linear polarization projection on each of these channels is 1/2 .",
    "the transmission curve ( * d * ) , which corresponds to the @xmath26 component , presents a minimum shifted towards positive detunings by the zeeman effect ; the position of the minimum corresponds roughly to the splitting of the @xmath96 transition ( 1.4 mhz / g ) , which has a maximum clebsch - gordan coefficient of 1 .",
    "curves ( * b * ) and ( * c * ) exhibit noticeable asymmetries , which we will discuss later .    from the data of fig.@xmath93 , we computed the three curves @xmath97 ( * a * ) , @xmath98 ( * b * ) and @xmath99 ( * c * ) characterizing the  polarization state of the transmitted light ( fig.@xmath100 ) .",
    "we note on the curve ( * * a)**of fig.3 that the degree of polarization @xmath70 is not always equal to unity , and can be substantially smaller depending on the parameters .",
    "this unexpected observation is due to the finite linewidth of our probe beam : light components at different frequencies , initially all linearly polarized , experience different rotations and deformations while passing through the cloud .",
    "because these components have different frequencies , the result of their recombination , when integrated over a time long compared to their beatnote time , is a loss of polarization ( for example , two orthogonal linearly - polarized waves of different frequencies and same intensity yield a totally unpolarized light @xmath72 ) .",
    "the result of the recombination of all the spectral components is not straightforward to predict , since each frequency is transmitted with a different intensity , ellipticity and rotation angle .",
    "however , if we assume that all the spectral components are mutually incoherent , the total intensity detected in each channel is the sum of  the intensities corresponding to all the spectral components .",
    "thus , in order to compare the experimental data with the model , we convolute the transmission curves @xmath101 @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , as calculated with the model of sec.@xmath93 , with the power spectrum of the probe laser .",
    "we can then compute the curves @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 using expressions ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) .",
    "we stress that the influence of the laser s linewidth is quite strong : even for a ( lorentzian ) linewidth of a tenth of the natural width , for an optical thickness @xmath108 and a magnetic field @xmath109 , the loss of polarization is already 32% ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "this phenomenon also affects the estimates for the ellipticity and the rotation angle , since these quantities reflect mainly the polarization state of the dominant transmitted spectral component . indeed ,",
    "if one again considers the example of the superposition of two waves of different frequencies and polarizations ( pure states ) , the results of the stokes analysis will vary continuously from one polarization state to the other depending on the intensity ratio of the two waves . in the intermediate regime of comparable intensities ,",
    "the stokes analysis will not describe adequately any of the two polarizations .",
    "it should be noted that this situation differs from the case where the studied light consist of a polarized component plus a depolarized one @xcite ; in this case , the stokes analysis provides the  correct  result ( that is , the ellipticity and angle of the polarized component ) , even for arbitrarily small proportion of polarized light .",
    "we experimentally tested the influence of a polychromatic excitation by superimposing to the normal probe beam a weaker one , obtained from the same laser but detuned by 80 mhz with an acousto - optic modulator .",
    "the calculated degradation of  @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath107 account well for the experimentally observed behavior .",
    "fig.@xmath100 ( * b ) * shows how the ellipticity @xmath111 of the polarized component of the transmitted light varies with laser detuning . for @xmath112 , it is mainly the @xmath26 component of the incident light which is absorbed , yielding a mostly @xmath27 transmitted polarization ( negative ellipticity ) . on resonance ( @xmath88 )",
    "both components are absorbed in the same proportion , an the transmitted polarization is linear ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "since the ellipticity depends on the differential absorption between circular components , it is a direct measurement of the dichroism in the sample .",
    "the curve on fig.@xmath100 ( * c ) * is the faraday rotation angle computed from expression ( 5 ) .",
    "the on - resonance rotation in this case is about 40@xmath62 .",
    "the solid lines in fig.@xmath100 are obtained with our model using the convolution procedure discussed above ; the probe light spectrum is described by the product of a lorentzian laser lineshape ( fwhm  = 3 mhz ) by a lorentzian fabry - perot transmission ( fwhm = 10 mhz ) .",
    "we account for the observed asymmetry in the experimental curves by introducing a linear variation in the populations of the ground state sublevels ( i.e. a partial orientation of the sample ) , with maximum variation @xmath114 between extreme magnetic numbers @xmath115 we have checked some other possible mechanisms for this asymmetry , such as the proximity of the f@xmath44f@xmath116 transition ( 121 mhz to the red ) or optical pumping , but both effects seem to play a small role .",
    "the fact that we were also able to invert the asymmetry by varying the orientation of the magnetic field produced by the compensation coils also favors the hypothesis of a partial orientation of the medium .",
    "we actually do see some optical pumping effects , manifested by variations of the measured transmission signals with time during the probe pulse ( duration 2 ms ) .",
    "the overall effect of optical pumping is to increase the faraday rotation as the number of exchanged photons ( i.e. time ) increases , i.e. the measured rotation immediatly after turning on the probe is smaller than after 2 ms of presence of the light ( by about 6% ) .",
    "the comparison of fig.@xmath100 between experiment and theory shows that , despite some discrepancies due to our rather vague knowledge of the probe lineshape and to the simplicity of our model , the overall agreement is quite satisfying .      to determine the verdet constant , it is necessary to measure the faraday angle as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "fig.@xmath117 shows such curves obtained for two different optical thicknesses : @xmath118 ( solid circles ) and @xmath119 ( open circles ) . for each curve ,",
    "the on - resonance faraday angle @xmath120 is scaled by the optical thickness of the cloud , since one expects the rotation to be proportional to the optical thickness ( thus , all experimental data should lie on the same  universal  curve ) .",
    "the solid line is the prediction of the model with a infinitely narrow probe laser .",
    "its slope around @xmath121 is about @xmath122 , yielding a verdet constant @xmath123 for an optical thickness @xmath124 and a sample diameter of 5 mm .",
    "the dashed curve represents the small optical thickness limit when the laser linewidth is taken into account , which lowers the slope at around @xmath125 .",
    "both curves exhibit the expected dispersive shape , with a linear increase of the faraday angle at small magnetic field values ( where the verdet constant is defined ) , and then a decreasing rotation when the splitting between the @xmath43 and @xmath27 transitions becomes larger than the natural width .",
    "the experimental curve for small optical thickness is quite close to the model prediction ( dashed line ) . for larger values of the optical thickness ,",
    "the measurements depart from this ideal situation due to the finite linewidth of the laser : the curve for @xmath119 presents a smaller slope around @xmath121 and the scaled rotation is globally reduced . as the optical thickness is further increased , the transmitted light becomes increasingly dominated by off - resonant components of the laser spectrum and the information about the central ( resonant ) frequency is lost .",
    "this process is further illustrated in the following subsection .      in the ideal case of a monochromatic laser ,",
    "one expects the faraday rotation to increase linearly with optical thickness .",
    "we thus recorded the rotation at @xmath88 and a fixed value of @xmath95 , as a function of the optical thickness which was varied by detuning the trapping laser .",
    "the result of such an experiment is shown in fig.@xmath126 .",
    "the open circles correspond to an applied magnetic field @xmath127 g , while the solid circles are for @xmath128 g. the solid line is the expected evolution for @xmath128 g and a monochromatic laser ; the dashed line is the prediction of the same model for @xmath127 g. we see that , for the higher value of @xmath95 , the expected linear behavior is indeed obtained , yielding a slope of about @xmath129 .",
    "the ( absolute ) rotation angle increases up to @xmath130 .",
    "however , the evolution observed at smaller magnetic field ( @xmath127 g , circles ) is quite different , where the data quickly depart from the linear evolution  even at low optical thickness and suddenly drop towards positive values of the angle at large optical thickness .",
    "qualitatively , this reflects the fact that , at small applied field and large optical thickness , the central ( resonant ) frequency of the probe laser is strongly attenuated and can become smaller than other ( off - resonant ) spectral components .",
    "the measured rotation angle then passes continuously from the angle of the central frequency component to that of the dominant detuned component ( in the wings of the absorption line ) , which can be negative ( see fig.@xmath100 ( * c ) * ) .",
    "the large dispersion of the data for @xmath127 g above @xmath131 is due to the important relative error in this low transmission regime . at larger @xmath95  field ,",
    "the on - resonance transmission increases due to the zeeman splitting , and the central frequency component remains dominant for larger values of the optical thickness ( for instance , the total transmission at @xmath132 is around 0.1 for @xmath128 g , while it is only 3@xmath133 for @xmath127 g ) .",
    "thus , the simple model of section 2 provides us with a good description for the various behaviors observed experimentally .",
    "a fair quantitative agreement is obtained for moderate optical thickness or high magnetic field .",
    "the model is also helpful to understand the important role played by the lineshape of the probe laser in this experimental situation of optically - thick sample and resonant light .",
    "the experimental data confirm the occurrence of large faraday effect inside our atomic cloud , with a verdet constant in the range of @xmath134 for a typical optical thickness of 10 .",
    "we have reported in this paper the measurement of large faraday effect in an optically - thick sample of cold rubidium atoms .  due to near - resonant excitation",
    ", we need to take into account both faraday rotation ( differential refractive index ) and dichroism ( differential absorption ) to analyze the experimental data . using a very simple model for our f @xmath44f@xmath45 transition",
    ", we obtain a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we measure large verdet constant of the order of @xmath134 .",
    "we have shown that the finite width of the laser spectrum plays a crucial role in the signals obtained for an optically - thick sample .",
    "a complete analysis of the transmitted light polarization state is then necessary to correctly interpret the data .",
    "the determination of the verdet constant @xmath135 in the cloud is an important step in our current study of the effect of an applied magnetic field on the coherent backscattering of light by the cold atoms . for faraday effect to seriously affect the cbs cone",
    ", one needs the phase difference between time - reversed waves , accumulated on a distance of the order of the light mean - free path @xmath136 , to be of the order of @xmath137 ( i.e. a rotation of @xmath138 for a linear polarization ) .",
    "this corresponds to a situation where @xmath139 @xmath140 @xcite . however , the main difference between the situation of ref.@xcite ( scatterers in a faraday - active matrix ) and our atomic cloud situation is that , in our case , the verdet constant is determined by the density of scatterers @xmath10 ( @xmath135 proportional to @xmath10 ) , which in turn fixes the mean - free path ( @xmath136 proportional to@xmath141 ) .",
    "thus , _ there is a maximum rotation per mean - free path length scale _ , which is about 13@xmath62 ( for @xmath142 g )  according to the curve of fig.@xmath117 ( solid line ) .",
    "it seems to us interesting to study this unusual situation .",
    "our aim is also to understand how the faraday effect combines to  the other effects due to the atom s internal structure to determine the cbs enhancement factor in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
