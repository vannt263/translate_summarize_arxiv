    "therefore , every triangulation of @xmath37 has more than @xmath190 interior vertices of a larger degree . by the pigeonhole principle",
    ", there exists a vertex @xmath187 that has a degree larger than 3 in more than @xmath191 triangulations of @xmath37 . combining this with the first observation from theorem [ le : old ] ( for every pseudo - triangulation with @xmath41 as the set of its pointed interior vertices , we can insert a ( unique ) single edge to obtain a pseudo - triangulation with @xmath42 as the set of its pointed interior vertices ) , we obtain @xmath192    in the proof of the following theorem [ th : ppt ] , we show that this observation can be extended to cases where @xmath41 has a larger size .",
    "moreover , at the end of this section we show how observation [ ob : first ] can be further improved . but",
    "first , since the bound in the observation gets better as the convex hull gets smaller , we derive the following lemma .",
    "consider a set @xmath37 of @xmath2 points with no restriction on the size of its convex hull .",
    "we pick three new points @xmath195 , such that the convex hull of @xmath195 contains the convex hull of @xmath37 in its interior .",
    "we set @xmath196 .",
    "let @xmath197 be the first point of @xmath37 that is hit when rotating the segment @xmath198 counterclockwise around @xmath199 .",
    "the points @xmath200 and @xmath201 are defined symmetrically ( see figure  [ fi : ppt1](b ) ) .",
    "let @xmath47 be a pointed pseudo - triangulation of @xmath37 . by inserting the edges @xmath202 into @xmath47 ( together with the points @xmath195 ) we obtain a pointed pseudo - triangulation of @xmath203 that contains @xmath47 .",
    "this implies that we can map every pointed pseudo - triangulation of @xmath37 to a distinct pointed pseudo - triangulation of @xmath203 , and thus , @xmath204 .",
    "the lemma then follows since @xmath205 .",
    "next , notice that we can use the trick from the proof of observation [ ob : first ] once again .",
    "recall that every triangulation has at least @xmath190 interior vertices of degree larger than 3 .",
    "removing a single edge can make one vertex pointed and reduce the degree of another vertex down to 3 .",
    "thus , every pseudo - triangulation that is counted in @xmath209 contains at least @xmath210 interior non - pointed vertices of degree larger than 3 .",
    "the same analysis implies the existence of an interior vertex @xmath211 such that @xmath212 repeating this iteratively , we get in the @xmath213-th step at least @xmath214 interior non - pointed vertices of degree larger than 3 , which implies @xmath215 we can perform @xmath216 steps of this process and then use theorem [ le : old ] , to obtain @xmath217 next , we notice that @xmath218 by using stirling s approximation ( that is , @xmath219 ) , we have @xmath220 finally , by combining and , we obtain @xmath221        * remark . *",
    "we believe that this technique can yield more significant improvements , since our analysis is not tight in several places : ( i ) there exist vertices with no separable edge adjacent to them .",
    "such vertices get a multiplier of 0 instead of 2 .",
    "( ii ) when removing a vertex of degree 3 ( which is the common case in our analysis ) , we remove at most one vertex of a larger degree , instead of two , which should provide a better ratio for the following round .",
    "( iii ) we will now show that observation [ ob : first ] is far from being tight , though our proof does not easily extend to the following rounds ( i.e. , when there is more than a single pointed interior vertex ) .        in the proof of observation [ ob :",
    "first ] we relied on the worst case bound on the number of vertices of degree 3 in a triangulation .",
    "however , it can be shown that the average case is much better .",
    "for any point set @xmath37 , on average , a triangulation of @xmath37 has at most @xmath224 vertices of degree 3  @xcite .",
    "that is , a uniformly chosen triangulation ( from the set of all triangulations of @xmath37 ) is expected to have at most @xmath224 vertices of degree 3 . using the same analysis as in the proof of [ ob : first ]",
    ", we notice that there exists some @xmath225 , such that @xmath226    * acknowledgements . *",
