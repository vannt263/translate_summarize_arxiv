    "the earth s magnetosphere can be considered as non - linear , dissipative system which is driven by the time varying solar wind .",
    "accumulated energy is ultimately dissipated , at least in part , through a system of currents generated in the auroral zones of the ionosphere .",
    "these currents produce small changes in the terrestrial magnetic field which can be used to monitor magnetospheric activity .",
    "the complex behavior of the magnetosphere , as suggested by many observations ( see , for example , @xcite ) , could then be attributed either to intrinsic magnetospheric processes , the complex nature of its coupling with the solar wind and the ionosphere or both .",
    "recent observations suggest that the multi - scale nature of this coupling is a fundamental aspect of magnetospheric dynamics ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "evidence is provided by a variety of observations which exhibit statistical properties previously identified as hallmarks of multi - scale systems . for example , bursty transport events have been reported in the magnetotail@xcite and their auroral signatures suggest self - similar statistics @xcite .",
    "= 0.5    the fluctuations in the ground based measurements of the magnetic field are non - gaussian and also exhibit scaling @xcite . in the context of time series analysis , geomagnetic indices are of particular interest as they provide a global measure of magnetospheric output and are evenly sampled over a long time interval .",
    "these indices also show non - gaussian statistics of fluctuations and anomalous scaling over the short time scales of up to few hours @xcite . the extent to which observed statistical features of the geomagnetic indices arise directly from those of the solar wind driver or the auroral currents",
    "is of fundamental interest .",
    "this is an example of the generic problem of distinguishing between features intrinsic to a driven system and those in the driver , when both show scaling .",
    "some recent studies has focused on direct comparison of scaling properties of the driver with these found in the geomagnetic indices@xcite to establish whether , to the lowest order , they are directly related .",
    "the difficulty with interpreting these observations arises from the fact that statistical features described above can be recovered from many existing models .",
    "self - organized criticality ( soc ) and turbulence have both been extensively used @xcite , + @xcite in the past . practically , one needs to obtain experimental constrains with which different models with similar characteristics can be tested . in this paper",
    "we present one possible approach to characterizing the time series in the context of scaling that does not rely on a specific model of multi - scale systems@xcite .",
    "the aim is to obtain statistical scaling properties directly from the data .    here",
    ", we will examine the statistical properties of akasofu s @xmath2@xcite parameter , which represents the energy input from the solar wind into the magnetosphere , and that of magnetospheric response as seen by the geomagnetic indices .",
    "previously , scaling has been quantified over a @xmath4 year data set for the indices and a comparison between @xmath5 and the indices included , but was not restricted to , the solar minimum ( @xmath6)@xcite . here , we will perform this comparison over intervals of solar minimum and maximum separately . the statistical description of the experimental data will be extended to @xmath4 standard deviations of the fluctuations .    to facilitate the comparison of all considered quantities we will first explore to what extend their fluctuations exhibit approximate self - similar scaling for temporal scales of @xmath3 hours .",
    "the quality of this self - similar approximation combined with values of the scaling exponents obtained at the solar minimum and maximum can be used to characterize each quantity .",
    "we will see that values of scaling exponents on these temporal scales for the geomagnetic indices are different from these found in the solar wind @xmath2 regardless of the phase of the solar cycle .",
    "remarkably , the scaling exponent of the @xmath0 index is unchanged between solar minimum and maximum whereas the @xmath1 scaling exponent changes with the solar cycle .",
    "= 0.5    in this respect , the @xmath1 index seems to follow the trend found in the driver , @xmath2 i.e. , the value of scaling exponent increases with increasing solar activity .",
    "we then construct a fokker - planck model for fluctuations in the geomagnetic indices and the @xmath2 at solar maximum as these exhibit the most satisfactory self - similar scaling .",
    "= 0.5    this allows us to obtain analytically a functional form of the fluctuation probability density function ( pdf ) which we can then check against the data . a stochastic dynamical model",
    "can then be formulated by considering the most general form of the langevin equation and deriving functional forms of the coefficients that are consistent with the fokker - planck equation ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "to facilitate this analysis we used multiple data sets that spanned over different phases of the solar cycle .",
    "two year intervals of data were selected centered on solar minimum and solar maximum .",
    "the solar wind data were obtained from wind and ace spacecraft observations .",
    "these were collected in the vicinity of the l1 point approximately @xmath7 au ( astronomical units ) from the sun .",
    ".data sets description [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab3 ]    this stochastic approach can be extended to obtain the langevin equation for the dynamics of the fluctuations@xcite .",
    "the langevin equation can be written in the most general form as : @xmath8 where the random variable @xmath9 is assumed to be @xmath10-correlated .",
    "equation [ langevin ] can be transform into purely additive noise form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that one can obtain a functional form of coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 in terms of @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( from equation [ mdl1.5 ] ) and the scaling exponent @xmath17 . such an equation provides a dynamical model for time series with the required statistical properties .",
    "the response of the earth s magnetosphere to the solar cycle and , by implication , a changing character of solar wind activity , illuminates the interplay between intrinsic magnetospheric dynamics and solar wind - magnetosphere coupling .",
    "statistical studies provide a simple and yet unifying way to quantify this behavior in the context of models for intermittency . in this paper",
    "we considered scaling properties of the solar wind driver , quantified by the @xmath2 parameter , and geomagnetic indices during solar minimum and maximum .",
    "we find that :    1 .",
    "fluctuations in the geomagnetic indices show approximate statistical self - similarity for a range of temporal scales .",
    "fluctuations in the @xmath2 at solar minimum show departure from scaling for @xmath18 minutes .",
    "the self - similar scaling emerges as a reasonable approximation for fluctuations @xmath5 at solar maximum .",
    "fluctuations in the geomagnetic indices exhibit self - similar scaling on temporal scales between @xmath19 minutes to @xmath20 hours .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath2 scales from @xmath19 minutes to @xmath21 hours , but only at solar maximum .",
    "2 .   fluctuations in the @xmath0 index exhibit scaling properties insensitive to the phase of the solar cycle .",
    "the scaling exponent of @xmath22 changes with the solar cycle and the trend follows that of the @xmath2 parameter 4 .   the value of the scaling exponents of indices and that of the @xmath2 parameter differ from each other at both solar minimum and maximum .",
    "this difference between scaling exponents of @xmath22 and the driver @xmath5 is approximately the same at solar minimum and maximum .",
    "a fokker - planck approach can be used to model the fluctuation pdf for the geomagnetic indices in both phases of the solar cycle and the @xmath2 at solar maximum to a good approximation    the approximate statistical self - similarity found for the indices for solar minimum and maximum and the @xmath2 at solar maximum is consistent with complex multi - scale processes such as turbulence or self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "the distinct values found for scaling exponents may reflect physical differences in the solar wind and the magnetosphere but may also be due to the very different way in which these quantities are derived .",
    "the fluctuations in the @xmath1 index depend on the solar cycle but the scaling exponent is distinct from that of @xmath2 fluctuations . interestingly , the difference between scaling exponents of @xmath22 and the driver @xmath5 appears to be approximately constant .",
    "these observations , when combined together , suggest that the process involved in generating fluctuations in the @xmath1 index is coupled to the solar wind driver , as seen in the solar cycle dependence .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath1 index fluctuations , these in the @xmath0 index are nearly insensitive to the change in solar cycle implying that the @xmath0 index is a measure of activity intrinsic to the magnetosphere . this is consistent with the @xmath1 index more closely monitoring activity on the day - side and @xmath0 reflecting activity in the magnetotail .",
    "the self - similar scaling of fluctuations allows us to model their statistics using a fokker - planck approach .",
    "we obtained analytically a functional form of the fluctuation pdf which approximates the measured pdf rather well .",
    "we stress that such an approach links the statistical features discussed here to dynamical modeling of the time series via stochastic langevin equations .",
