    "while the topological matter and related phenomena have become a popular subject especially in the past few years within the condensed - matter community  @xcite , a new window has just recently been opened to the exotic world of topological phases in atomic and molecular physics communities , with arguably a greater premise on a route toward studying them under highly controllable atomic settings  @xcite .",
    "the current advances in atomic systems offer the possibility of engineering both abelian or non - abelian artificial gauge fields on demand , by coupling the internal states of atoms to their center - of - mass motion via raman dressing of atomic hyperfine states with laser fields . while there are a number of theoretical proposals for implementing atomic gases with various soc symmetries , several experimental groups have so far only achieved an abelian erd coupling , first with bose  @xcite and then with fermi  @xcite gases .",
    "allured by the experimental possibilities , there has been a growing interest in studying spin - orbit coupled atomic bose and fermi gases as functions of the tunable laser parameters including the strength and symmetry of the soc field , @xmath0-wave scattering length and zeeman fields .",
    "both the uniform and trapped systems have been considered in all one , two and three dimensions , already revealing exotic single- , two- , few- and many - body properties at both zero and finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "[ htb ]    in particular to the fermi gases , depending on both the strength and the symmetry of the soc field , it has been shown that the interplay between the soc and out - of - plane zeeman fields gives rise to a variety of topologically - nontrivial and thermodynamically - stable gapless superfluid phases  @xcite . in confined geometries ,",
    "some of these phases have been shown to feature majorana zero - energy bound states , for which the associated quasiparticle operators are self - hermitian , i.e. a majorana quasiparticle is its own anti - quasiparticle  @xcite .",
    "these quasiparticles play a key role in fault - tolerant quantum computation , and although they are predicted to be found in strongly - correlated systems in many fields of physics , including the fractional quantum hall systems  @xcite , chiral two - dimensional @xmath1-wave superconductors  @xcite / superfluids  @xcite , three - dimensional topological insulator - superconductor heterostructures  @xcite , one - dimensional nanowires  @xcite , spin - orbit coupled semiconductor - superconductor heterostructures  @xcite , etc .",
    ", their realization has proved to be quite difficult .",
    "given that the cold atoms offer unprecedented control in comparison to the condensed - matter ones , there is a good chance of creating and observing majorana quasiparticles with atomic systems in the near future .",
    "motivated by these recent developments  @xcite , here we analyze the effects of not only the out - of - plane but also the in - plane zeeman fields on the phase diagram of a fermi gas with erd coupling .",
    "since the inclusion of an in - plane zeeman field complicates the many - body problem considerably even at the mean - field level , this term has been completely ignored in the recent literature  @xcite , even though it appears naturally in the active experiments  @xcite . by including it here , we find gapless superfluid phases that can be distinguished with respect to the topology of the momentum - space regions with zero excitation energy .",
    "for instance , for the bcs - like uniform superfluid phases with zero center - of - mass momentum , the zeros may correspond to one or two doubly - degenerate spheres , two or four spheres , two or four concave spheroids , or one or two doubly - degenerate circles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : topclass ] ) .",
    "these phases are distinct because , even though their order parameters all have the same @xmath0-wave symmetry , changes in the topology leave strong signatures on some of the thermodynamic quantities , signaling a topological quantum phase transition .",
    "we also analyze the possibility of fflo - like nonuniform superfluid phases with finite center - of - mass momentum  @xcite and obtain an even richer phase diagram .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian in sec .",
    "[ sec : mft ] , and derive a complete set of nonlinearly - coupled self - consistency equations for the amplitude of the superfluid order parameter , center - of - mass momentum , total number and polarizations .",

    "these fields have very different origin in cold - atom systems , where the raman coupling and detuning between the two laser beams driving the raman transition from the two - photon resonance correspond to the out - of and in - plane zeeman fields , respectively , and the erd coupling is the doppler shift an atom experiences as it moves in the two laser fields  @xcite .    the mean - field hamiltonian for this system ( in units of @xmath9 )",

    "to analyze the bcs - like uniform superfluid phases , it is sufficient to solve four equations only , i.e. ( [ eqn : gap ] ) , ( [ eqn : ntot ] ) , ( [ eqn : pi ] ) and ( [ eqn : po ] ) , with @xmath57 , for a self - consistent set of @xmath58 and @xmath59 values .",
    "we also checked the stability of our mean - field solutions for the uniform superfluid phase using the curvature criterion , i.e. a nonuniform superfluid phase ( e.g. a phase separation ) is favored when @xmath60 , since this criterion coincides with that of the compressibility one , i.e. the matrix @xmath61 must be positive - definite for the stability of the obtained solutions .",
    "before , we present the resultant phase diagrams , let us first analyze the excitation spectrum of the system .      in general , all four branches of the excitation spectrum may be different from each other , and hence both @xmath62 and their @xmath58 and @xmath59 derivatives are not analytically tractable and need to be evaluated simultaneously with the self - consistency eqs .",

    "[ fig : pdbcs](c ) , this particular data has the same @xmath44-space topology as the @xmath104 limit .",

    "in addition , on the @xmath3 axis when @xmath94 , our results recover the recent works  @xcite .",
    "away from the @xmath8 and @xmath3 axes , we find that the gapless superfluid phases with two or four concave spheroids of zeros occupy quite large regions in the phase diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdbcs ] . depending on @xmath93 and @xmath27 ,",
    "note that the transition from a gapless superfluid phase with two or four spheres of zeros to the one with two or four concave spheroids of zeros may require a finite threshold for @xmath59 .",
    "for instance , when the soc is weak so that the spheres of zeros contain doubly - degenerate circles as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : topclass](b ) and  [ fig : topclass](f ) , an arbitrarily small @xmath59 splits these degeneracies , immediately giving rise to the transition .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdbcs](c ) . on the contrary ,",
    "when the soc is sufficiently strong so that it splits the spheres of zeros completely away from each other leaving no degeneracy , the transition occurs at a finite @xmath59 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pdbcs](a ) and  [ fig : pdbcs](b ) .",
    "[ htb ]    next we note an important difference between the grand - canonical ( zeeman fields ) and canonical ( number polarizations ) phase diagrams on the bcs side of the bcs - bec evolution , and consider the @xmath75 limit for the sake of its simplicity . in a grand - canonical phase diagram , where @xmath110 is increased from 0",
    ", it can be shown that while @xmath36 is unaffected by @xmath115 until @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the value of the field - free order parameter when @xmath94 , it immediately vanishes for @xmath118 . therefore",
    ", increasing @xmath110 leads to a first - order quantum phase transition between a gapped superfluid and normal phase , without any intermediate gapless superfluid phase in between . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of a canonical phase diagram , where @xmath111 is increased from 0 , there exists a @xmath119 solution with @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is determined by the maximum possible number polarization @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , in sharp contrast to the grand - canonical case , it is possible to obtain a gapless superfluid phase with increasing @xmath111 .",
    "for this reason , the canonical phase diagram suits better for presenting the possible gapless superfluid phases at unitarity as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdbcs](c ) .",
    "however , on the bec side of the bcs - bec evolution , such a complication does not exist , and it is possible to map the grand - canonical and canonical phase diagrams onto each other as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pdbcs](a ) and  [ fig : pdbcs](b ) .",
    "we emphasize that even though all of these gapless superfluid phases have order parameters with the same @xmath0-wave symmetry , they can be classified with respect to the topology of their zeros .",
    "it is well - known in other contexts that such changes in the topology leave strong evidences on the thermodynamic quantities such as the atomic compressibility , spin susceptibility and momentum distribution , signaling a topological quantum phase transition .",
    "for instance , in nodal @xmath1-wave superconductors and superfluids for which the order parameters are @xmath44 dependent , while the excitation spectrum @xmath123 has gapless points of zeros in @xmath44 space ( which are determined by the nodes of @xmath124 ) when @xmath125 on the bcs side , it is fully gapped when @xmath126 on the bec side , showing a lifshitz - type phase transition in the bcs - bec evolution which occurs precisely at @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "the presented phase diagrams clearly demonstrate here that it is possible to simulate a much richer variety of gapless superfluid phases and numerous possible ways of phase transitions between them with active experiments .",
    "next , we investigate whether these phases survive if we allow a finite center - of - mass momentum @xmath127 .",
    "in the previous section , having shown that the presence of an in - plane zeeman field has a dramatic effect on the stability of bcs - like uniform superfluid phases with @xmath57 , i.e. nonuniform superfluid phases occupy a very large region in the phase diagrams when @xmath103 , here we discuss the possibility of fflo - like nonuniform ( spatially - modulated ) superfluid phases with @xmath128 as a possible ground state of the system such that @xmath129 ( see sec .  [ sec : mft ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , one needs to solve all seven equations , i.e. eqs .  ( [ eqn : gap])-([eqn : po ] ) , in general for a self - consistent set of @xmath130 and @xmath59 values , which is a highly nontrivial task .",
    "our numerical solutions suggest that @xmath131 for a greater portion of the parameter space , and therefore , we set @xmath132 , and solve only for @xmath133 .",
    "[ htb ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfflo ] , we show the color maps of the magnitude of the order parameter @xmath36 and @xmath8 component @xmath133 of the center - of - mass momentum , together with the ground - state phase diagram when @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "these parameters correspond to that of the figure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdbcs](c ) .",
    "first of all , we find that @xmath136 on the @xmath137 axis when @xmath104 , and therefore , conclude that fflo - like nonuniform superfluid phases are not favored in the absence of an in - plane zeeman field , which is consistent with the stability analysis given in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdbcs](c ) . on the other hand , we find that @xmath133 grows almost linearly on the @xmath111 axis , i.e. @xmath138 , and the fflo - like phases are strongly favored in the absence of an out - of - plane zeeman field , which is again consistent with the stability analysis given in fig .  [",
    "fig : pdbcs](c ) . therefore , there is a clear competition between out - of- and in - plane zeeman fields when both fields are present .",
    "it turns out that the effects of in - plane field rapidly dominates over the out - of - plane one , as a result of which fflo - like phases occupy almost the entire phase diagram .",
    "in addition , a direct comparison between figs .  [",
    "fig : pdbcs](c ) and  [ fig : pdfflo](c ) shows that fflo - like phases are more favored than the bcs - like ones against the normal phase .",
    "( figure  [ fig : nkfflo ] )    [ htb ]    we note that while allowing the superfluid order parameter to have a single nonzero center - of - mass momentum @xmath127 favors the nonuniform phase over the uniform one where @xmath57 , this may not be the case if we allow multiple @xmath127 momenta , e.g. @xmath139 .",
    "this is because fflo - like nonuniform superfluid phases in spin - orbit coupled fermi gases are stabilized mainly by the asymmetry of the fermi surfaces in @xmath44 space , and this mechanism is in contrast with that of the condensed - matter ones where they are stabilized by the symmetric zeeman mismatch in @xmath44 space .",
    "therefore , only in the latter case , we expect the solutions involving the superpositions of @xmath127 and @xmath140 momenta to be favored even more than the @xmath141 or @xmath140 solutions themselves .",
    "however , such a comparison is beyond the scope of this work .    in addition ,",
    "similar to our analysis for the bcs - like uniform superfluid phases given above in sec .",
    "[ sec : bcs ] , we further classify the fflo - like nonuniform superfluid phases with respect to the topology of the momentum - space regions with zero excitation energy . although the zeros of some of the phases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfflo](c ) are very similar to the bcs - like ones shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : topclass ] and  [ fig : pdbcs](c ) , there are also a variety of new ones arising due solely to @xmath142 .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : nkfflo ] , we illustrate the gapless branches of the excitation spectrum as well as the projections of the momentum distribution @xmath143 for three of the topologically distinct phases labeled in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfflo](c ) . unlike the case of bcs - like superfluid phases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nkbcs ] , note that the particle - hole symmetry @xmath144 does not necessarily require the zero - energy regions of the fflo - like superfluids to have the inversion symmetry around @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , we see that the main effect of erd coupling is best seen in the @xmath53 and @xmath3 projections of the momentum distribution as a @xmath7-dependent zeeman field , since the time - reversal symmetry is broken by both @xmath108 and @xmath91 for these projections . for fflo - like superfluid phases , this figure clearly shows that sharp features of @xmath143 and zero - excitation - energy regions @xmath144 do not match in @xmath44-space , and they are shifted exactly by @xmath145 , i.e. @xmath146 in our paper .",
    "these shifts are important since it is in sharp contrast to the bcs - like superfluid phases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nkbcs ] , where sharp features of @xmath143 and zero - excitation - energy regions exactly coincide in @xmath44 space . therefore , the competing bcs - like gapless uniform and fflo - like nonuniform superfluid ground states",
    "can easily be distinguished by directly looking at their momentum distributions , which has probably been the most commonly used probing technique in cold atom systems since the early days .",
    "in summary , we analyzed the effects of both in- and out - of - plane zeeman fields on the bcs - bec evolution of a fermi gas with an erd spin - orbit coupling field at zero temperature .",
    "depending on the combination of these gauge fields , we found novel gapless superfluid phases that can be distinguished with respect to the topology of their zeros .",

    "<S> , the zeros may correspond to one or two doubly - degenerate spheres , two or four spheres , two or four concave spheroids , or one or two doubly - degenerate circles , depending on the combination of zeeman fields and soc . </S>",
    "<S> such changes in the topology signal a quantum phase transition between distinct superfluid phases , and leave their signatures on some thermodynamic quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the possibility of fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo)-like nonuniform superfluid phases with finite center - of - mass momentum and obtain an even richer phase diagram . </S>"
