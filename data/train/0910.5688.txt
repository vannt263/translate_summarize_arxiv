    "many concepts in geometric group theory , including hyperbolic groups , @xmath0 groups , and biautomatic groups , were developed to capture the geometric and computational properties of examples such as negatively curved closed riemannian manifolds and closed topological @xmath1-manifolds . while the geometric and computational aspects of hyperbolic groups are closely interconnected , the relationship between the geometrically defined class of @xmath0 groups and the computationally defined class of biautomatic groups is much less clear .",

    "we begin by reviewing the theory of nonpositively curved metric spaces built out of euclidean polytopes .",

    "this was a key result from bridson s thesis @xcite and is the main theorem of chapter i.7 in @xcite .",

    "the natural next step would be to prove the following :    for any compact nonpositively curved triangle - square complex @xmath3 there are only finitely many distinct thoroughly crumpled planes that immerse into @xmath3 . as a consequence ,",
    "there is a global value @xmath34 depending only on @xmath3",
    "so that gersten - short paths in any flat inside @xmath109 that start and end within @xmath8 unit of each other synchronously @xmath34-fellow travel .    once this point has been reached , one should use the fellow traveling constants within planes and the @xmath0 nature of @xmath109 overall to prove that all gersten - short paths in @xmath109 synchronously @xmath34-fellow travel for some uniform global @xmath34 .",
    "since the constants in pure square , pure triangle and striped flats are small , and periodic crumpled flats have bounded intersection with other flats , this seems reasonable .",
    "the necessary arguments might be similar to those used by chris hruska in @xcite . finally , once it is known that these paths fellow travel in @xmath109 , the falsification by fellow traveler property @xcite should be invoked to establish the regularity of the language they describe ."
