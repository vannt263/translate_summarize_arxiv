    "the discovery that the current universe is in an accelerating expansion phase , obtained from the observations of type ia supernovae @xcite , inaugurate an era of intense theoretical research to understand the mechanism driving this accelerating expansion .",
    "an immediate consequence is that gravity behaves differently on cosmological distance scales .",
    "a variety of possible solutions to the cosmic acceleration puzzle have been debated during this decade including the cosmological constant , exotic matter and energy , modified gravity , anthropic arguments , etc .",
    "the most favored ones are dark energy based models and modified gravity theories such @xmath1 gravity and dgp gravity with an equation of state parameter @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the energy density and pressure of the cosmic fluid , respectively ) .",
    "the dark energy component is usually described by an equation - of - state parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the simplest and traditional explanation for dark energy is a cosmological constant , which is usually interpreted as the vacuum energy .",
    "however , the value required to explain the cosmic expansion , which is of the order of @xmath6 can not be explained by current particle physics .",
    "this is known as the cosmological constant problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the first year wmap data combined with the 2df galaxy survey and the supernova ia data favor the phantom energy equation - of - state of the cosmic fluid @xmath7 over the cosmological constant and the quintessence field .",
    "a candidate for phantom energy is usually a scalar field with the wrong sign for kinetic energy term @xcite .",
    "one crucial fate of an expanding universe driven by phantom energy is that the phantom energy density and the scale factor diverge in finite time , ripping apart all bound systems of the universe ( galaxies , stars , atoms , nuclei ) , before the universe approaches the big - rip singularity @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested by the effect of cosmological expansion on local systems , namely a black hole embedded in a an expanding friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe driven by phantom energy .",
    "the study of non - stationary event horizons and their thermodynamical parameters , relevant for a quantum theory of gravity , are currently attracting a great interest @xcite-@xcite . in the pure expanding flat flrw universe dominated by phantom energy ,",
    "the radius of the observer s event horizon diminishes with time and consequently the horizon entropy , @xmath8 an other example is the quasi - de sitter space , where the event horizon and apparent horizon are different @xcite .",
    "it was found that the first law and second law of thermodynamics can not hold when both the horizons are considered .",
    "other authors discussed the effect of the presence of black holes in expanding phantom energy - dominated universe on the validity of the generalized second law of gravitational thermodynamics ( gsl ) @xcite .    in this paper , we present a detailed calculation of the entropy of the solution of einstein s equations recently found and representing a black hole embedded in an expanding friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe@xcite .",
    "our approach is based on the brick - wall method ( bmw ) invented by thooft @xcite . in this method a brick wall around the horizon prevents the divergence of the free energy ( or entropy ) of the black hole , which is identified with the canonical ensemble statistical - mechanical free energy ( or entropy ) due to quantum excitations in thermal equilibrium with the black hole .",
    "however , the bmw can not be used for non - equilibrium systems , like black holes with multi - horizons , where each horizon can be considered as an isolated thermodynamical system .",
    "the solution to the problem , known as the thin - layer improved method , consists in considering a thin layer near the horizon as a local equilibrium system and invoking thermodynamics of composite systems , such that the entropy of a multi - horizons black hole is the sum of the contributions arising from each horizon @xcite .",
    "then in the improved bwm , the global equilibrium has been replaced by a local equilibrium on microscopic scales .",
    "this method has been applied to a wide range of black holes with multi - horizons like schwarzschild - de sitter black hole , kerr - de sitter black hole , vaidya black hole , the 5d ricci - flat black string and recently to the calculation of the entropy in the pure expanding flrw universe @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii we review the exact solution describing a black hole embedded in an expanding friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe . in section iii , the statistical mechanical free energy , thermal energy and entropy due to a scalar field are computed using the improved thin - layer bwm . then we discuss the conditions under which the d - bound conjecture @xcite is protect in expanding universe in the presence of black holes . in section iv , our attention will be focused on the conditions under which the second law of thermodynamics and the gsl are satisfied when the universe is driven by phantom energy .",
    "finally , we discuss and summarize our results in section v.",
    "the first solution of einstein s theory of general relativity describing a black hole like object embedded in an expanding universe was introduced by mcvittie in 1933 @xcite , and is given in isotropic coordinates by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the scale factor and @xmath11 is the mass of the black hole in the static case .",
    "in fact , when @xmath12 it reduces to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "when the mass parameter is zero , the mcvittie reduces to a spatially flat flrw solution with the scale factor @xmath10 .",
    "the global structure of ( [ eq : mcvittie ] ) has been studied and particularly it has been shown that the solution possesses a spacelike singularity on the 2-sphere @xmath13 and can not describe an embedded black hole in an expanding spatially flat flrw universe @xcite .    in the following",
    "we adopt the new solution describing a black hole embedded in a spatially flat flrw universe @xcite    @xmath14    using the areal radius    @xmath15    the metric takes the following suitable painlevel@xmath16-gullstrand form    ds^2= & -dt^2+(1-)^-1dr^2[eq : metric02 ] + & -2rh(1-)^-1dtdr+r^2d^2 ,    where @xmath17 is the hubble parameter and overdot stands for derivative with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "we observe that the term @xmath18 plays the role of variable cosmological constant . in order to write the metric in the nolan gauge",

    "the wave - function is obtained by the ansatz @xmath41 . neglecting higher orders contributions and substituting in eq.@xmath42 with the ansatz @xmath43",
    ", we obtain    b^2 + 2hrb+^2[eq : momentum ] + -(1-(1-r_ah))(^2+r^-2l(l+1 ) ) & = 0 .    in our derivation",
    "we have assumed the constancy of the frequency @xmath44 near the ah and that @xmath45 . solving for @xmath46",
    "we obtain    @xmath47    where we have set    @xmath48    which is just @xmath49 . the sign ambiguity in eq.@xmath50",

    "the number of radial modes with energy less that @xmath44 is defined by    @xmath53    where we used the average of the radial momentum .",
    "the second term in ( [ n ] ) is caused by a different direction such that the outgoing and ingoing particles are taken into account .",
    "using eq.@xmath50 we get    @xmath54    now , according to the canonical ensemble theory the free energy is defined by    @xmath55    integrating by parts we obtain    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the total number of modes with energy less than @xmath44 given by    @xmath58    substituting the expression of @xmath59 and restricting the integration over @xmath60 to the range    @xmath61,\\ ] ]    the free energy takes the form    @xmath62    the integral over the radial variable is determined by the improved thin - layer bwm boundary conditions    @xmath63    where @xmath64,@xmath65 are ultraviolet cutoffs and @xmath66 are thickness of the thin layer , near the bh horizon and cosmomlogical horizon , respectively .",

    "the calculation yields@xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",

    "the expression of temperature ( [ eq : temp ] ) is similar with the temperature in york theory of black holes confined in isothermal cavities @xcite . in this context",
    ", a local observer at rest will measure a local temperature which scale as @xmath102 for a self - gravitating mass in thermal equilibrium with the boundary of the cavity .",
    "the effect of the boundary is reflected in the relation ( [ eq : misner - sharp ] ) , which state that the hawking - hayward quasi - local mass is the sum of the thermal energy and a gravitational self - energy due to the cavity . in our case ,",
    "the black hole is embedded in an expanding universe , and the cosmic apparent horizon plays the role of the boundary of the cavity . on the other hand the behavior of temperature with time",
    "is contrasted with the naive expectation that the temperature is redshifted by the scale factor @xmath10 relative to its value in static background .",
    "the additional correction terms to the temperature become important when the density energy of the universe is negligible compared to the expansion rate .",
    "the same remark apply to the entropy which will show a behavior with time different from the expected one @xmath103 . here",
    "some comments are appropriate about the assumption of local equilibrium used in the calculation , even we are considering dynamical horizons .",
    "the improved thin - layer bmw method is based on the fact that hawking radiation is mainly due to the vacuum fluctuations near the black hole horizon(s ) , and then allows to identify the black hole entropy with the statistical - mechanical entropy associated with quantum fields outside the black hole and confined in small region(s ) in the vicinity of the horizon(s ) .",
    "this cure the problem of maintaining thermal equilibrium at large scales of the original bwm of thooft , without taking into account the back - reaction of the background .",
    "however , in small regions we are dealing with the assumption of local equilibrium and the validity of the statistical laws we used in the calculation , and therefore need a physical justification .",
    "the local equilibrium state is achieved if thermodynamics properties of the system are slowly varying .",
    "the last condition when applied to the case of the case of a black hole immersed in an expanding flrw universe is equivalent to the following statement : `` local equilibrium is achieved if local thermalization of the system is faster than the expansion rate of the universe '' .",
    "in fact assuming that @xmath104 and using eq.(39 ) we obtain @xmath105 this condition can be rewritten as @xmath106 which is an expression of the last statement    in the pure flat flrw case where only the cosmic ah survives , @xmath107 , we obtain    @xmath108    which is proportional to the de sitter temperature , @xmath109    now , substituting eq.@xmath110 in @xmath111 the entropy takes the form    @xmath112.\\label{eq : entropy}\\ ] ]    in order to compare our results with the standard flrw universe , we set the cutoffs as    @xmath113    and introduce the following factors    @xmath114    then the final expressions of thermal energy and entropy take the forms    @xmath115    @xmath116    we assume now that matter in the universe is in the form of an imperfect fluid with a radial heat flux , described by the stress - energy tensor    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is the fluid four velocity@xmath119 , @xmath120 a spacial vector describing radial heat current , and @xmath121 the general solution of the einstein equations are given by @xcite ,    8g=3 & ( ) ^2h^2,[eq : ae1 ] + 8gp= & -()^2.[eq : ae2 ]    assuming @xmath122 and radial energy inflow ( @xmath123 ) , the accretion rate can be written as@xmath124 where @xmath125 . in terms of the comoving ah",
