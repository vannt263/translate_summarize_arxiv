    "in a society , people typically have a wide range of opinions .",
    "however , individual opinions on a particular issue are not static but rather evolve due to the influences of acquaintances or other external factors . in principle , opinions could evolve _ ad infinitum _",
    ", consensus could emerge , or a population could reach a state that consists of a finite set of distinct opinion clusters , or `` parties '' .    it is natural to discuss this process within the framework of interacting particle systems @xcite .",
    "a classic example is the voter model where agents , who possess two possible opinions , adopt the state of a randomly selected neighbor @xcite .",
    "individual opinions evolve until consensus is eventually reached , and the probability that a given opinion ultimately wins is equal to the initial fraction of agents with that opinion @xcite .",
    "several other ising - type opinion models , incorporating more realistic features , have been proposed recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the compromise model , a simple model for the evolution of opinions in a heterogeneous population @xcite . to account for the diversity of the population ,",
    "the opinion is either a real - valued variable or a discrete variable with many states @xcite . to mimic the natural human tendency for reaching a fair compromise , in an interaction between two agents ,",
    "both acquire the average of their initial opinions .",
    "last , to incorporate self confidence or conviction in one s own opinion , interactions between agents whose opinion difference is larger than some threshold are forbidden .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the compromise model have shown that either consensus or diversity can arise , depending on system parameters @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the compromise model using numerical integration of the governing rate equations for continuum opinions and analytical solutions for discrete opinions .",
    "numerical integration is more efficient than direct numerical simulation and provides better resolution of the time dependent and steady state behaviors .",
    "we find that the compromise model exhibits a rich behavior . in the long - time limit",
    ", the system condenses into a finite set of equally - spaced opinion clusters ( parties ) , with the population in adjacent clusters alternating between two values that differ by 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "as the initial range of opinions grows , the number of parties increases via a periodic sequence of bifurcations .",
    "the corresponding period governs the basic features of the emergent structure , namely , the size of the major clusters , and their separation . near bifurcation points , the size of minor clusters vanishes algebraically , and we provide a heuristic explanation for this behavior .",
    "underlying the compromise model is a stochastic averaging process .",
    "closely related averaging processes naturally arise in diverse systems , including one - dimensional inelastic collisions @xcite , dynamics of headways in traffic flows @xcite , mass transport @xcite , force fluctuations in bead packs @xcite , wealth exchange processes @xcite , and the hammersley process @xcite . while our findings are discussed in the framework of opinion dynamics , they may very well be relevant in these different contexts .    in sec .",

    "iii , we examine systems with a finite number @xmath0 of discrete and equally - spaced opinions .",
    "when @xmath0 is relatively small , these systems can be treated analytically , thereby illuminating the behavior in the continuum case .",
    "generally , consensus is reached for small enough @xmath0 , while a state with several distinct non - interacting clusters is reached for large @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude in sec .  iv .",
    "in the continuum version of the compromise model , each agent is initially assigned an opinion @xmath1 from some specified distribution .",
    "randomly selected pairs of agents undergo sequential interactions .",
    "such interactions are restricted to agents whose opinion difference lies below a threshold that is set to unity without loss of generality . when agents with opinions @xmath2 and @xmath3 interact , both acquire the average opinion : @xmath4 while if @xmath5 , no interaction occurs .",

    "= 7.6 cm    for larger values of @xmath27 , the opinion distribution does not condense into a single cluster , but rather the distribution evolves into `` patches '' that are separated by a distance larger than one .",

    "the range @xmath34 was investigated using a fine mesh ( @xmath35 increments ) .",
    "the rate equations were integrated using a fourth order adams - bashforth method @xcite up to a sufficiently long time that the probability distribution separated into noninteracting patches .",
    "then , the two conservation laws were invoked to determine the ultimate mass and location of each patch .",
    "the accuracy was @xmath36 in @xmath9 .",
    "the cluster locations exhibit a striking regularity , as seen in plotting @xmath37 versus @xmath27 ( fig .",

    "there are three types of clusters : major clusters ( mass @xmath38 ) , minor clusters ( mass @xmath39 ) , and a central cluster located exactly at @xmath40 .",
    "the number of clusters grows via a series of bifurcations .",
    "when @xmath18 , the final state is a single peak located at the origin , and this situation persists as long as @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath27 exceeds one , two new clusters are born at the extreme edges , @xmath42 .",
    "as @xmath27 increases , further bifurcations of three basic types occur :    1 .   nucleation of a symmetric pair of clusters : @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "annihilation of a central cluster and simultaneous nucleation of a symmetric pair of clusters : @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "3 .   nucleation of a central cluster : @xmath47 .",
    "= 7.6 cm    the bifurcations always occur in a periodic order : @xmath48 .",
    "numerically , the first 4 generations of bifurcations are located at @xmath49 successive bifurcation points of the same type are all separated by the same distance : @xmath50 .",
    "also , the distance between different types of bifurcations within the same generation eventually becomes constant .",
    "thus the bifurcation diagram , with all its intricate features , repeats in a periodic manner @xmath51 with period @xmath52 .",
    "the period was estimated by extrapolating the differences in the locations of the first few transitions to @xmath53 .    in type-1",
    "( 2 ) bifurcations , branches of minor ( major ) clusters nucleate near the origin , and these persist for all larger @xmath27 . as each branch evolves ,",
    "notice that it exhibits a large curvature change or a kink due to the effect of a subsequent bifurcation . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the branch growth is practically linear with a slope commensurate with the opinion range : @xmath55 .",
    "the periodic behavior further implies that the separation between clusters becomes constant .",
    "moreover , when a system of size @xmath27 is compared with a system of size @xmath56 , cluster locations in the smaller system coincide with the larger one , as shown in fig .",
    "[ masses ] .",
    "the larger system , however , contains two additional pairs of major and minor clusters .",
    "thus , the period @xmath57 governs the overall number of clusters and the separation between them . for @xmath58",
    "there are @xmath59 clusters , with neighboring clusters separated ( approximately ) by distance @xmath60 .",
    "= 7.6 cm    an even richer picture emerges when the cluster masses are considered .",
    "first , the cluster masses vary periodically in the initial opinion range , that is , @xmath61 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ cluster - mass ] .",
    "second , clusters are organized in an alternating major - minor pattern ( see figs .",
    "[ bifurcate ] and [ masses ] ) . for large @xmath27",
    ", each cluster mass approaches a constant value .",
    "the major clusters , which contain nearly the entire mass in the system , saturate at a value equal to the period , @xmath62 .",
    "the masses of the minor clusters approach a much smaller level : @xmath63 ( see fig .  [ cluster - mass ] ) .",
    "this minute mass implies that a sufficiently large population is needed for minor clusters to exist .",
    "the central cluster is special .",
    "its mass never becomes constant but instead varies in a periodic manner with @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ cluster - mass ] ) .",
    "a central cluster nucleates with an infinitesimal mass at a type-3 bifurcation , grows slowly for a while , then it undergoes an explosive growth until its mass becomes of order unity .",
    "finally , its mass grows linearly with @xmath27 . at some threshold ,",
    "the central cluster splits into two major clusters via a type-2 bifurcation ( fig .",
    "[ cluster - mass ] ) . this birth - and - death pattern repeats _",
    "ad infinitum_.    the minor clusters exhibit two subtle features .",
    "first , the mass of the most extreme cluster saturates to a mass @xmath64 that is approximately one order of magnitude greater than all other minor clusters .",
    "second , the mass of the minor clusters varies non - monotonically with @xmath27 and there is a small range of @xmath27 , where the mass of a newly - born minor cluster suddenly drops ( fig .",
    "[ cluster - mass ] ) before the mass saturates to a constant value .",
    "we are unable to resolve whether there is a finite gap or just a singular point where the mass vanishes .",
    "= 7.6 cm    at type-1 and type-3 bifurcations , new clusters form , and the mass of these nascent clusters vanishes algebraically according to @xmath65 as @xmath66 .",
    "the exponent depends only on the type @xmath67 of the bifurcation point ; numerically we find @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ mass ] ) .",
    "we now give a heuristic explanation for this behavior .",
    "to understand the behavior near a type-1 bifurcation , consider the very first one at @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "it is convenient to divide the total opinion range @xmath73 into a central subinterval @xmath74 and two boundary subintervals : @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath77 be the mass in a boundary subinterval .",
    "initially , @xmath78 .",
    "such mass is lost due to interaction with one half of the central subinterval . as a result , @xmath79 , which gives @xmath80 on the other hand ,",
    "the mass of the central subinterval gets concentrated in a region near the origin whose spread @xmath81 decreases with time . at some moment @xmath82 the separation between masses in the central and boundary subintervals exceeds unity .",
    "we anticipate that the mass in the boundary subinterval converges to its center @xmath83 , and hence , this critical separation occurs when @xmath84 . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the interaction between the two subintervals stops and the mass of the emerging minor cluster freezes at @xmath86 .    the spread @xmath81 can be estimated by noting that to zeroth order in @xmath87 , ( i ) the central subinterval is not affected by the boundary subintervals , and ( ii ) eventually , almost all agents are within the interaction range .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic behavior is the same as in the case @xmath18 , and the spread follows directly from the second moment ( [ m2 ] ) , @xmath88 since @xmath89 . using the stopping criteria , @xmath90 , the final minor cluster mass is @xmath91 , leading to @xmath92 .",
    "consider now a type-3 bifurcation that occurs at some @xmath93 .",
    "we write @xmath94 and adapt our previous argument .",
    "let @xmath77 be the mass of the newly - formed central cluster , and let @xmath95 be the final mass of the two major clusters surrounding it .",
    "we have @xmath96 , since the central cluster interacts with half of the mass @xmath95 on either sides .",
    "therefore @xmath97 in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) where the amplitude was of order @xmath87 , the amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ rho3 ] ) is of order unity .",
    "this arises because the range of opinions that contributes to the ultimate central cluster is of the order of the interaction range .",
    "now the argument proceeds as before .",
    "the width of the large cluster varies as @xmath98 .",
    "the condition for the central cluster and its neighbors to decouple is @xmath99 . at this point",
    ", we have @xmath100 , resulting in the exponent @xmath101 .",
    "the heuristic argument we have presented is consistent with the extremely small mass of the minor clusters . for large @xmath27 , the system is governed by the parameter @xmath102 , the excess between the adjacent cluster separation and the interaction range .",
    "this parameter essentially plays the role of @xmath87 , the small distance from a bifurcation point .",
    "the two extreme minor clusters evolve according to the mechanism that led to the @xmath103 behavior near a type-1 bifurcation .",
    "thus , their mass can be estimated @xmath104 .",
    "on the other hand , minor clusters in the bulk evolve according to the mechanism that led to the @xmath105 behavior near a type-3 bifurcation . accordingly",
    ", their mass is estimated by @xmath106 , again a reasonable value .",
    "often , one faces a choice among a finite set of options , so it is natural to consider a discrete version of the compromise model . while interesting on its own , the discrete model also enables us to illuminate many qualitative aspects of the behavior in the continuum case .",
    "discrete systems are governed by a finite set of non - linear rate equations , so explicit solutions are generally impossible .",
    "nevertheless , we can gain considerable insight by investigating small systems , using stability analysis and related tools from theory of ordinary differential equations @xcite .    in the discrete version ,",
    "each agent can take on an opinion from a set of @xmath0 equally - spaced values . to impose an interaction threshold and also to ensure that the outcome of an interaction remains within the state space , two agents interact as follows : ( a )",
    "if the opinion difference is greater than two , there is no interaction .",
    "( b ) if the difference equals two , the agents reach a fair compromise and each takes on the average opinion value .",
    "( c ) if the opinion difference equals one , nothing happens .",
    "we label the opinion states as @xmath107 , so schematically , in a compromise event @xmath108 .",
    "denote by @xmath109 the fraction of the population that has opinion state @xmath110 at time @xmath8 .",
    "for general @xmath0 the fractions @xmath109 obey the rate equations @xmath111 this equation formally applies for @xmath110 at least 2 spacings away from the boundaries ( at @xmath112 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "setting @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ rate - eq ] ) , yields the governing equations near the boundaries : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 . again ,",
    "the fractions @xmath109 satisfy two conservation laws : @xmath118 with @xmath119 .",
    "the former ( latter ) reflects conservation of the total population ( opinion ) . as a result",
    ", there are @xmath120 independent variables for an @xmath0-state system .      equations ( [ rate - eq ] ) are non - linear and therefore for @xmath121 they can not be solved to obtain explicit formulae for @xmath109 .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior can be still understood .",
    "for example , eqs .",
    "( [ rate - eq ] ) admit only the simplest type of attractors  fixed points  while limit cycles are impossible .",
    "we illustrate this by analyzing small values of @xmath0 to highlight the new qualitative features that arise as @xmath0 increases .      for @xmath122 , there is a single fixed point located at @xmath123",
    "this point is _",
    "stable_. asymptotically , it is approached exponentially fast in time ; _",
    "e.g. _ , for @xmath124 one finds @xmath125 .",
    "an exception arises for the symmetric initial condition ( @xmath126 ) when the final central state @xmath127 is approached algebraically in time : @xmath128 .    for @xmath129",
    ", there is also a single stable fixed point located at @xmath130 additionally , there is a fixed point @xmath131 that is always unstable .",
    "the stable fixed point is approached exponentially in time .      for @xmath132",
    ", some fixed points are no longer isolated but instead they form _",
    "lines_. indeed , eqs .",
    "( [ rate - eq ] ) admit fixed points of the generic forms @xmath133 and @xmath134 that are stable when , respectively , @xmath135 or @xmath136 . recalling the conservation laws ( [ sums ] ) we can write these fixed points in the form @xmath137 and obviously the fixed points form lines . the fixed points ( [ stable ] ) from the first line are stable when @xmath138 , the fixed points ( [ stable ] ) from the second line are stable when @xmath139 .",
    "there is also a stable isolated fixed point located at @xmath140    for @xmath141 , every initial condition is in the basin of attraction of the isolated fixed point ( [ single ] ) .",
    "therefore we know the fate of the system without explicitly solving the rate equations .",
    "this statement tacitly assumes that a trajectory does not approach a limit cycle or other complicated attractor ; this will be justified later . in the complementary range @xmath142 the trajectories approach one of the stable fixed points in ( [ stable ] ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath124 , the final state is @xmath143 for some @xmath144 . to determine which fixed point",
    "is actually reached depends not only on the initial average opinion @xmath145 but also on other details of the initial condition and requires a complete solution .",
    "qualitatively , for an initial state that is central in character ( @xmath141 ) , the final occupation fractions are concentrated in a single central cluster consisting of two adjacent sites .",
    "conversely , for an initial state that is biased toward one extreme , the final state consists of two extremal clusters .",
    "the above elementary examples demonstrate a simple principle .",
    "the rate equations have multiple stable fixed points .",
    "each stable fixed point is a basin of attraction for some region in the space of initial conditions .",
    "the dynamics determine which stable fixed point is eventually approached . in the continuous version ,",
    "a similar situation occurs where there are enormously many steady states of the form ( [ final ] ) .",
    "moreover , we see how depending on the initial conditions , the system can reach a single central cluster or two off - center clusters .    in the remainder of this subsection we consider symmetric situations , @xmath146 .",
    "for an @xmath0-state system , we can choose @xmath147 independent states , where @xmath148 is the smallest integer that is larger than or equal to @xmath149 .",
    "conservation of population diminishes the number of independent variables by one , while the second conservation law is redundant as @xmath150 always .      for @xmath151 ,",
    "the rate equations ( [ rate - eq ] ) are exactly solvable and the solution neatly illustrates the features described in the previous subsection . using symmetry and normalization , we can treat the system in the two - dimensional triangular domain defined by ( fig .  [ triangle ] ) @xmath152 there are two kinds of fixed points : an isolated fixed point @xmath153 and a line of fixed points @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "linearizing near the isolated fixed point we find that @xmath156 satisfies @xmath157 from which the origin is a degenerate stable node .",
    "linearizing near a fixed point @xmath154 we find that it is stable iff @xmath158 and unstable iff @xmath159 .",
    "thus the isolated fixed point has a finite - area basin of attraction , while every point @xmath154 with @xmath158 has a basin of attraction that is a one - dimensional manifold ( fig .  [ triangle ] ) . in principle",
    ", a two - dimensional system could have closed orbits .",
    "however , every closed orbit in a two - dimensional system must enclose fixed points @xcite .",
    "here , all fixed points lie on the boundary of the phase plane @xmath160 , so closed orbits that encircle a fixed point are impossible , thereby ruling out cycles .",
    "the solution to eqs .",
    "( [ rate - eq ] ) for @xmath151 with symmetric initial conditions is given in the appendix .",
    "this solution gives the following behavior in the phase space @xmath160 ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "there is a separatrix ( [ separ ] ) that joins @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
    "the part of the phase plane to the left of the separatrix is the basin of attraction of the isolated fixed point , while the complementary region is the basin of attraction of the line of fixed points @xmath154 with @xmath163 .",
    "these fixed points are approached exponentially in time . finally , the separatrix itself is the basin of attraction of the fixed point @xmath164 . in this borderline case",
    "the relaxation is algebraic rather than exponential : @xmath165 both consensus and polarization are possible outcomes  which actually occurs depends on the initial condition .      for @xmath166 ,",
    "the systems are @xmath167 dimensional , and already the trajectories of 3-dimensional systems may exhibit a vast range of behaviors including chaos @xcite . in the present case , however , we find that there are simply more and more fixed points , and they appear as isolated fixed points , lines , surfaces , and higher - dimensional sub - manifolds .    for @xmath168 ,",
    "the system is three - dimensional , and the phase space is the simplex @xmath169 for simplicity , we denote states by @xmath170 .",
    "the system admits the following fixed points :    1 .   a line of fixed points @xmath171 corresponding to a polarized society .",
    "2 .   a line of fixed points @xmath172 corresponding to a society with both centrists and extremists .",
    "the second case includes the central consensus state @xmath173 as a special case .",
    "linearizing around the fixed point @xmath171 we find that @xmath174 satisfies @xmath175 implying that @xmath171 is a stable node ( we tacitly assume that @xmath176 ; when @xmath177 this node is degenerate ) .",
    "linearizing around the fixed point @xmath172 we find that @xmath178 satisfies @xmath179 implying that @xmath172 is a saddle point .",

    "the two extreme fixed points @xmath181 and @xmath173 are _ neutrally _ stable in the linear approximation .",
    "therefore one must go beyond the linear approximation to probe the stability of consensus .",
    "numerically , one typically finds that the system reaches consensus ( _ e.g. _ , starting from the uniform initial condition ) .",
    "therefore , consensus appears to be stable .    for larger @xmath0",
    ", we determined the final state numerically . to compare with the continuum case",
    ", we start with the uniform initial condition .",
    "generally , the final state consists of non - interacting clusters .",
    "each cluster consists of a pair of occupied sites and clusters are separated by at least two empty sites .",
    "we assign each cluster a mass @xmath182 equal to the combined occupation of the two sites , and a position @xmath1 determined from a weighted average .    as a function of @xmath0 , the number of clusters grows via a series of transitions , rather than bifurcations ( fig .",
    "[ m=2 ] ) .",
    "the main difference with the continuum case is that while minor clusters occasionally appear , they do not persist in the form of minor branches . otherwise , there are many similarities",

    "the existence of a lyapunov function rules out cycles . indeed , suppose that there is a periodic solution with period @xmath202 , then the integral @xmath203 over the period would be negative because the lyapunov function is decreasing .",

    "therefore , minute details of the initial conditions are magnified , ultimately resulting in isolated clusters . however , the nonlinear terms in eq .",
    "( [ cont ] ) eventually counter the instability .",
    "the interplay between compromise and conviction leads to intriguing opinion dynamics .",
    "the system ultimately reaches a static state that consists of a finite number of noninteracting opinion clusters , and the number of these clusters increases via an infinite sequence of self - similar bifurcations as the opinion range increases . in the bulk of the system ,",
    "clusters are organized in a periodic lattice of alternating minor and major clusters .",
    "a central cluster may or may not exist , and its size exhibits a complex periodic behavior .    as a model of mathematical sociology , the compromise model is appealing in its simplicity , yet its behavior is familiar in everyday experience .",
    "a political system may or may not contain a centrist party .",
    "alternatively , it may consist of two ( or more ) off - center parties",
    ". furthermore , the existence of marginal parties halfway between two major ones is also reasonable . artificial features of the model , such as the identical separation between parties , can be easily circumvented by introducing heterogeneities .",
    "for example , since different agents may have different levels of conviction , it may be natural to have interaction thresholds that are specific to each individual .    as a dynamical system , the compromise model exhibits the simplest types of attractors , namely , fixed points that are either sinks or saddles . in the discrete case , we constructed lyapunov functions and also established that limit cycles and strange attractors are impossible .",
    "this conclusion extends to the continuum case .",
    "the second moment decreases monotonically with time and hence , it is a lyapunov functional . generally , each stable fixed point is the basin of attraction of some region in the space of initial conditions . in other words , the rate equations map an initial state into a final state .",
    "given the large number of these states , it is not obvious how to characterize such a map .",
    "one practical approach is to obtain statistical properties of the final state by averaging over all possible initial conditions . in the discrete case , we find that starting from a random initial state ( @xmath217 randomly chosen in the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube ) the distribution of cluster masses and the distribution of the separations between clusters in the final state are independent of the system size , for large enough systems .",
    "there are important questions concerning robustness of the bifurcation diagram with respect to variations in the dynamical rules or in the initial conditions .",
    "we examined only the former .",
    "when the opinion difference between two agents is merely reduced by a fixed factor , _",
    "i.e. _ , they reach partial compromise , an almost identical bifurcation diagram is found .",
    "the effects of asymmetry in the initial conditions , and the dependence of the location of bifurcation points on the shape of the initial distribution deserve a careful study .",
    "there are numerous possible generalizations of the compromise model .",
    "one is to increase the dimension of the opinion space .",
    "do the final opinions form a lattice ? and if yes of what type ?",
    "yet another open question is the role of spatial dimension . in the present work",
    ", we implemented the mean - field limit where any agents equally well interact with any other agent .",
    "however , if agents are located at lattice sites with interactions only between nearest neighbors , spatial correlations are expected to emerge @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that for the discrete system in which @xmath218 , with @xmath219 depending on the spatial dimension @xmath220 , the system will freeze into a large number of non - interacting opinion domains .",
    "the case of continuum opinions is unexplored , but we expect both slow dynamics and coarsening of opinion patterns as the final state is approached .    we thanks z.  a.  daya and h.  a.  rose for useful discussions .",
    "this research was supported by doe ( w-7405-eng-36 ) and nsf(dmr9978902 ) .",
    "the symmetric @xmath151 system simplifies after replacement of the time variable @xmath8 by @xmath221 as the rate equations reduce to the linear system @xmath222 where @xmath223 . solving these equations we obtain @xmath224\\,e^{-\\tau},\\\\ p_3(\\tau)&=&1 -\\left[2p_1(0)\\,\\tau + p_1(0)+p_2(0)\\right]\\,e^{-\\tau}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    depending on the initial conditions ,",
    "@xmath225 either remains positive or it reaches zero . in the former case , @xmath226 as @xmath227 and asymptotically the isolated fixed point is reached .",
