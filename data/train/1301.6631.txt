    "in the last few years graphene has attracted considerable attention as a material of much promise for nanotechnology due to its unique mechanical , electrical and optical properties.@xcite noting that at short separations between test bodies the fluctuation - induced dispersion interactions , such as the van der waals and casimir forces , become dominant,@xcite it is important to investigate them in the presence of a graphene sheet . in this connection",
    "much theoretical work has been done on the calculation of dispersion forces between two graphene sheets,@xcite a graphene sheet and a metallic , dielectric or semiconductor plate,@xcite a graphene sheet and an atom or a molecule@xcite etc .",
    "the calculations were performed using phenomenological density - functional methods,@xcite second order perturbation theory,@xcite and the lifshitz theory with some specific form for the reflection coefficients of electromagnetic oscillations on graphene.@xcite however , in spite of the impressive progress in measurements of the casimir force in configurations with metallic , dielectric and semiconductor test bodies ( see reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite and more recent experiments @xcite ) , there is yet no previous measurement of dispersion forces acting on graphene .    in the present paper",
    "we report measurements of the gradient of the casimir force acting between a graphene sheet deposited on a sio@xmath0 film covering a si plate and an au - coated sphere .",
    "our measurements are performed by means of dynamic atomic force microscope ( afm ) operated in the frequency - shift technique described in detail in refs .",
    "we demonstrate significant increase in the gradient of the casimir force in comparison with that between a si plate covered with a sio@xmath0 film and an au - coated sphere , i.e. , in the absence of graphene sheet . at short separations",
    "this increase is up to a factor 4 - 5 larger than the total experimental error in the measurement of the force gradient determined at a 67% confidence level .",
    "we also compare the experimental results with an approximate theory where the gradients of the casimir force between a si - sio@xmath0 system and au - coated sphere and between a graphene described by the dirac model and the same sphere are computed independently of one another using the lifshitz theory and then are added .",
    "some excess of the theoretical force gradient over the experimental one is attributed to the screening of the si - sio@xmath0 surface by a graphene sheet .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly describe the detection system , the measurement scheem and the sample preparation .",
    "section iii contains the measurement results and their comparison with theory .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions .",
    "the detection system used in our measurements consists of an afm cantilever with attached hollow glass microsphere coated with au , piezoelectric actuators , fiber interferometers , light source , and phase locked loop ( pll ) .",
    "the thickness of the au coating and the radius of the coated sphere were measured to be 280 nm and @xmath1 m using an afm and a scanning electron microscope , respectively .",
    "a turbo - pump , oil - free dry scroll mechanical - pump and ion - pump were used to achieve high vacuum down to @xmath2torr ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for detail of the setup ) .    in the dynamic measurement scheme the total force @xmath3 acting on the sphere [ where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electric and casimir force , respectively , and @xmath6 is the separation distance between the sphere and graphene ] modifies the resonant natural frequency of the oscillator .",
    "the change in the frequency @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the resonance frequencies in the presence and in the absence of external force @xmath10 , respectively , was recorded by the pll .",
    "this was done at every 0.14 nm while the plate was moved towards the grounded sphere starting at the maximum separation .",
    "this was repeated with one of 10 different voltages @xmath11 in the range from 38.5 to 58.4mv for the first graphene sample and from 5.2 to 97.4mv for the second graphene sample applied to the graphene sheet while the sphere remained grounded .",
    "the application of voltages and respective measurements were repeated for two times resulting in 20 sets of @xmath12 as a function of separation for each graphene sample .",
    "large area graphene used in our experiment was obtained through a two - step chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) process described.@xcite in this process @xmath13 m thick polycrystalline copper foil ( 99.8% purity ) was cleaned by diluted hcl solution followed by deionized water rinse .",
    "then the copper foil was placed into @xmath14 cm copper bag which had undergone the same clean process as above .",
    "the copper bag was loaded into a ceramic tube furnace for the cvd process .",
    "first the copper bag was annealed at @xmath15c under continuous ar / h@xmath0 ( 69sccm/10sccm ) flow .",
    "graphene was grown on the copper foil by introducing methane / hydrogen gas of 1.3sccm/4sccm for one hour and 35sccm/4sccm for another hour .",
    "then the furnace was cooled down to room temperature under a continuous flow of ar / h@xmath0 ( 69sccm/10sccm ) .",
    "finally , the grown graphene was transferred from the copper foil to 300 nm sio@xmath0 layer on a b - doped si layer of @xmath16 m thickness on the bottom by using poly - metil methacrylate ( pmma ) as the graphene support layer and ammonium persulfate solution as the copper etchant .",
    "we have examined the quality of the graphene layer through raman spectroscopy @xcite and quantum hall effect measurements,@xcite which show single layer graphene characteristics .",
    "measurements of 2d - mobility for a large area graphene onto sio@xmath0 substrates performed in our laboratory demonstrate mobility above @xmath17 .",
    "a roughly estimate for the concentration of impurities would be @xmath18 , if we consider that each impurity adsorbs one electron .    the gradients of the total and casimir forces were found from the measured frequency shifts using electrostatic calibration . to perform this calibration of the setup",
    ", we used the expression for the electric force in sphere - plate geometry @xcite @xmath19 here @xmath20 is a known function and @xmath21 is the residual potential difference between a sphere surface and a graphene sheet which is nonzero even when both surfaces are grounded . in the linear regime which is realized in our setup @xcite the gradient of the casimir force is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the spring constant of the cantilever . note that the absolute separations between the zero level of the roughness on the sphere and graphene are found from @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the plate movement due to the piezoelectric actuator and @xmath27 is the closest approach between the au sphere and graphene ( in dynamic experiments the latter is much larger than the separation on contact of the two surfaces ) .    from the position of a maximum in the parabolic dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , one can determine @xmath21 with the help of a @xmath28-fitting procedure . from the curvature of the parabola with the help of the same fit it is possible to determine @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "this was done at different separations for the two graphene samples used in our experiment . in fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] we present the values of @xmath21 as a function of separation determined from the fit for the first and second graphene samples ( the lower and upper sets of dots , respectively ) .",
    "the obtained values were corrected for mechanical drift of the frequency - shift signal , as discussed in ref .  @xcite . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] , the resulting @xmath21 do not depend on separation . to check this observation",
    ", we have performed the best fit of @xmath21 to the straight lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] leaving their slopes as free parameters .",
    "it was found that the slopes are @xmath30mv / nm and @xmath31mv / nm for the first and second samples , respectively , i.e. , the independence of @xmath21 on @xmath6 was confirmed to a high accuracy .",
    "this finally leads to the mean values @xmath32mv and @xmath33mv for the first and second samples , respectively , where errors are determined at a 67% confidence level . note that different graphene sheets may lead to different @xmath21 due to occasional impurities",
    "the possible impurities could be organic , h@xmath0 , o@xmath0 , n@xmath0 and h@xmath0o .",
    "all these may become dopants of graphene and change its work function .",
    "next the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath29 were determined from the fit at different separations and found to be separation - independent .",
    "for the first and second samples the mean values are equal to @xmath34 nm , @xmath35khzm / n and @xmath36 nm , @xmath37khzm /",
    "n , respectively . from the measured resonant frequency",
    "we have confirmed that the obtained value of @xmath29 results in the spring constant @xmath24 consistent with the estimated value provided by the cantilever fabricator .",
    "for each graphene sample the gradients of the casimir force @xmath38 as a function of @xmath6 were obtained from the measured @xmath12 in two ways : by applying 10 different voltages @xmath11 with subsequent subtraction of the electric forces ( 2 repetitions ) and by applying the compensating voltage @xmath39 ( 22 repetitions ) . in these cases",
    "20 and 22 force - distance relations were obtained , the mean force gradients were computed and their total experimental errors were determined at a 67% confidence level as a combination of random and systematic errors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in fig .",
    "[ fg2](a , b ) the mean gradients of the casimir force and their errors measured for the first sample with applied compensating voltage are shown as crosses with a step of 1 nm . table  1 presents the values of mean @xmath38 at several separations measured in the two different ways for the first ( columns a , b ) and second ( columns c , d ) samples . as can be seen in table  1 ,",
    "the measurement results for the two graphene samples obtained in two different ways are in very good mutual agreement .",
    "now we compare the experimental results with theoretical predictions . at the moment",
    "there is no theory allowing rigorous calculation of the casimir force between a graphene deposited on a si - sio@xmath0 substrate and an au sphere .",
    "the problem is that si and sio@xmath0 layers are described by their dielectric permittivities and the reflection properties of graphene in the dirac model are described by the polarization tensor .",
    "this does not allow direct application of the lifshitz theory for layered structures @xcite .",
    "because of this , here we restrict ourselves to the approximate approach , where the contributions of si - sio@xmath0 substrate and graphene sheet to the casimir interaction with an au sphere are computed separately using the lifshitz theory and are then added together . in the framework of the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) , the lifshitz formula for the gradient of the casimir force between an au sphere and any planar structure takes the form @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath42k is the laboratory temperature , @xmath43 is the projection of the wave vector on a planar structure , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 are the matsubara frequencies .",
    "the prime near the summation sign multiplies the term with @xmath47 by 1/2 , and @xmath48 denotes the transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "note that an error arising from the application of pfa was recently found @xcite using the exact theory for the sphere - plate geometry and was shown to be less than @xmath49 , i.e. , of about 0.5% in our experiment .    the quantity @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is the standard fresnel reflection coefficient for an au surface calculated at the imaginary frequencies ( an au layer can be considered as a semispace ) .",
    "it is expressed in terms of the dielectric permittivity @xmath51 using the tabulated optical data for au @xcite extrapolated to zero frequency either by the drude or by the plasma models.@xcite    unlike the case when a graphene layer is present , the casimir interaction of the si - sio@xmath0 substrate with an au sphere is described by the well tested fundamental lifshitz theory . here",
    "the quantity @xmath52 has the meaning of the reflection coefficient on the two - layer ( si - sio@xmath0 ) structure @xcite where si can be considered as a semispace .",
    "it is expressed in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in our computations we used @xmath53",
    "obtained @xcite from the optical data @xcite for si extrapolated to zero frequency either by the drude or by the plasma models ( si plate used has the resistivity between 0.001 and @xmath55 cm which corresponds to a plasma frequency between @xmath56 and @xmath57rad / s and the relaxation parameter @xmath58rad / s ) . a sufficiently accurate expression for @xmath54 from ref .  @xcite was used in the computations .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "roughness on the surfaces of sphere and graphene was measured by means of afm and found to be equal to 1.6 nm and 1.5 nm , respectively .",
    "it was taken into account using the multiplicative approach,@xcite and its maximum contribution to the force gradient is equal to only 0.1% at the shortest separation .",
    "the computational results for @xmath38 between a si - sio@xmath0 substrate and an au sphere are shown by the solid band in fig .",
    "the width of the band indicates the uncertainty in the value of @xmath59 and a difference between the predictions of the drude and plasma model approaches to the description of au and si which is small in this experiment .",
    "the latter is illustrated in columns e and f of table  1 .",
    "figure  [ fg2 ] and table  1 indicate conclusively that within the separation region from 224 to 320 nm the measured gradients of the casimir force are larger than that for a si - sio@xmath0 substrate interacting with an au sphere . this demonstrates the influence of the graphene sheet on the casimir force .",
    "the reflection coefficients for a suspended graphene described by the dirac model are represented in the form @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the components of the polarization tensor in 3-dimensional space - time and the trace stands for the sum of spatial components .",
    "the computational results for the gradient of the casimir force between the suspended graphene with the mass gap parameter @xmath62 and @xmath63ev and an au sphere as a function of @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg3 ] by the upper and lower lines , respectively ( here the results do not depend on whether the drude or the plasma model approach for au is used @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] the dashed band shows the sum of the force gradients between a si - sio@xmath0 substrate and an au sphere and between graphene and the same sphere .",
    "the width of the band takes into account the respective width for a substrate interacting with a sphere and also differences in predictions of the dirac model of graphene with the mass gap parameter varying from 0 to 0.1ev .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] that the used approximate approach overestimates the measured force gradient , as it should , keeping in mind that it does not take into account the screening of the sio@xmath0 surface by the graphene layer .",
    "thus our results also illustrate nonadditivity of the van der waals and casimir interactions in multilayer structures.@xcite note that at short separations our approximate approach ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] ) is in better agreement with the data than the approach which disregards the graphene layer ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] ) .",
    "thus , at @xmath64 nm the relative difference between the prediction of the approach disregarding graphene and the measured force gradient is equal to 10.1% of the measurement result and between the prediction of our approximate approach taking graphene into account and the same force gradient is equal to 7.1% .",
    "it is quite natural , however , that at large separations the influence of the graphene layer is overestimated by our approximate approach .",
    "to conclude , we have demonstrated the influence of a graphene layer on the casimir force between a si - sio@xmath0 substrate and an au sphere . at the shortest separation",
    "measured the relative excess in the force gradient due to the presence of graphene deposited on a substrate reaches 9% and decreases with increasing separation .",
    "our experimental results are found to be in qualitative agreement with an approximate theoretical approach describing the reflection coefficients on graphene via the polarization tensor in 3-dimensional space - time , whereas the layers of the substrate are described by means of the dielectric permittivity .",
    "the standard lifshitz theory for layered structures is not applicable to such cases .",
    "a more exact theoretical description than the one used in this work remains a challenge to theory .",
    "the present work will serve as a motivation in this direction .",
    "the casimir interaction of graphene should be taken into account in future applications of carbon nanostructures in nanotechnology .",
