    "attempts to understand the large transverse single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) observed in the various high energy scattering processe presently form an active field of research .",
    "the experimental observations are a great theoretical challenge as the collinear leading twist contribution to the asymmetries is proven to be proportional to the quark mass  @xcite and thus very small . however , during the past few decades , remarkable theoretical progresses was achieved by following mainly two approaches : one approach is based on transverse momentum dependent(tmd ) factorization  @xcite and the other on collinear twist-3 factorization  @xcite . in tmd factorization , a naive time reversal odd tmd distribution , known as sivers function  @xcite describing the correlation between the parton intrinsic transverse momentum and hadron transverse spin vector is responsible for the asymmetries . in the collinear",
    "twist-3 approach the ssas arise from twist-3 quark gluon correlators so - called efremov - teryaev - qiu - sterman functions ( etqs )",
    "@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "these two framework have their own kinematic regions of validity and were shown to produce the same results in the overlap of these kinematic regions  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental property of both mechanisms is that the imaginary part necessary for non - vanishing ssas is dynamically generated through initial / finial state interactions . in the case of tmd factorization",
    ", the effect of these initial / finial state interactions is encoded in the process dependent gauge link appearing the matrix element defining the tmd distributions .",
    "due to different structures of these gauge links in different processes , naive time reversal odd tmd distributions , like the sivers function possess a very unique , modified universality property , namely , that the sivers functions in dis and drell - yan process differ by a minus sign  @xcite .",
    "while ssas in dis have been measured by hermes  @xcite and compass  @xcite , a polarized drell - yan measurement is not yet available , such that this prediction could not yet be tested .",
    "alternatively , one can simply fit the etqs function related to the @xmath2 moment of the sivers function  @xcite using input from hermes and compass  @xcite and compare it with a direct extraction of @xmath3 from the ssa obserevd for pion production in polarized @xmath4 collisions  @xcite .",
    "promising early results along these lines , have , unfortunately been caused by a sign error , such that the obserevd discrepancies are now referred to as `` sign mismatch '' of these two processes  @xcite .",
    "our recent work  @xcite also indicated that this procedure gives the wrong sign for ssa in inclusive dis off a neutron target ( for a complete theoretical treatment of this asymmetry , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) if the quark gluon correlation @xmath3 fitted to data for the process @xmath5 were used as the input for the twist-3 quark photon correlation .",
    "this suggests that the ssas observed in process like @xmath5 are not mainly caused by the sivers mechanism as described in the twist-3 collinear approach  @xcite . a possible explanation is suggested by the observation  @xcite that the collins effect  @xcite describing ssa as caused by parton fragmentation can contribute significantly .",
    "this observation has been confirmed by a more recent analysis  @xcite .    in order to better understand the sivers mechanism in hadronic collisions , it is desirable to investigate ssa for cases of particle production in polarized @xmath4 collisions for which the collins effect is absent .",
    "possible options are the ssa in direct photon or jet production production @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "another option which was initially proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is the ssa in heavy quarkonium production .",
    "the author of the paper  @xcite analyzed ssa in heavy quarkonium production following the general arguments of non - relativistic qcd(nrqcd )  @xcite . in the framework of nrqcd",
    ", the heavy quarkonium can be produced at short distance not only in the color singlet but also the color octet configuration .",
    "the transition from heavy quark and antiquark pair to a quarkonium state is treated as a non - perturbative process and encoded in the long distance universal matrix elements which are characterized according to the velocity expansion of nrqcd . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ssa in heavy quarkonium production offers a unique way to investigate its production mechanisms since the ssa crucially depends on the final state interactions which differ significantly for heavy quarkonium production in the color singlet and the color octet channel .",
    "recently , a ssa in @xmath7 has been measured at phenix and found to be sizeable  @xcite . according to the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , this hints at a dominance of a color singlet mechanism at low transverse momentum and at a non - zero gluon sivers effect . also , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the color evaporation model in combination with tmd factorization was used to study the ssa for @xmath8 production in @xmath9 collisions .    following this research line",
    ", we apply the collinear twist-3 approach to compute the ssa for heavy quarkonium production in polarized @xmath4 collisions . in the present work ,",
    "the earlier pioneering analysis  @xcite is extended and refined in the sense that we compute the transverse momentum dependent behavior of the spin asymmetry , and also take into account the hard gluon pole contribution .",
    "we only focus on @xmath0 production in this paper , though our formalism can be easily extended to ssas for the production of other c - even quarkonia , such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in leading order",
    ", a c - even quarkonium can be produced through two gluon fusion , which makes it a promising way to access both unpolarized and linearly polarized gluon tmd distributions  @xcite .",
    "the application of tmd factorization in these processes has been justified by a recent nlo calculation  @xcite .",
    "experiments measuring such @xmath0 asymmetries could be performed at rhic and a proposed fixed target experiment at lhc(after )  @xcite .",
    "lhc would allow us to study the gluon polarization effect in a deep saturation regime@xcite due to the very high energy of lhc and relative low mass of c - even charmonium . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the promising channels to detect @xmath14 were discussed .",
    "the analysis  @xcite based on nrqcd suggested that for c - even quarkonium production , the color octet contribution is suppressed while the color singlet contribution dominates , in particular at low transverse momentum  @xcite , though complications may arise at large transverse momentum  @xcite . moreover , c - even bottomonium production in the color octet configuration can certainly be neglected  @xcite , since it is strongly suppressed in the velocity expansion . on the other hand , the ssa in c - even heavy quarkonium production receives a contribution not only from etqs function but also from the tri - gluon correlation  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we restrict ourselves to color singlet production , i.e. the @xmath3 contribution , and leave the color octet part and tri - gluon correlation for a future study , as we are primarily aiming at establishing a formalism that combines collinear twist-3 techniques and nrqcd factorization to describe ssa in heavy quarkonium production in the present paper .    our calculation is carried out in the covariant gauge closely following the techniques outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the ssas for pion and direct photon production in hadronic collisions were computed .",
    "recently , in analogy to the ssas , the double spin asymmetry @xmath15 in the same processes was also studied within the collinear twist-3 framework  @xcite . unlike the ssa in pion or photon production , tmd factorization could be applied in the kinematical region where the transverse momentum of the heavy quarkonium is much smaller than its mass .",
    "we extrapolate the complete collinear twist-3 result to the small transverse momentum region and find that it is consistent with the result obtained from tmd factorization .",
    "the key step in establishing this connection is to derive the large transverse momentum gluon sivers function and relate it to the etqs function . doing so , we find that the hard gluon pole contribution to the gluon sivers function was overlooked in the previous literature  @xcite",
    ". we will also comment on the scale evolution of tri - gluon correlations for the flavor singlet case in the following section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the section 2 , we first briefly review @xmath0 production in unpolarized hadron collisions . next we derive the spin dependent differential cross section for @xmath0 production in hadronic collisions , presenting the result in the limits of high and low transverse momentum . in particular , we discuss the matching between tmd factorization and the collinear twist-3 approach at small transverse momentum . the paper is summarized in section 3 .",
    "we start by introducing the relevant kinematical variables . for the process under consideration , @xmath16 we define the 4-momenta and polarization vector of the incoming nucleons @xmath17 and outgoing heavy quarkonium @xmath18 as indicated .",
    "the mandelstam variables are @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding mandelstam variables on the partonic level are given by @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the longitudinal momentum fractions carried by the partons from nucleon @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively . the squared invariant mass of the heavy quarkonium is @xmath29 and @xmath30 up to small relativistic corrections , where @xmath31 is the heavy quark mass .    ) and o(@xmath32 ) . gluon - gluon scattering at order o(@xmath32 ) is not shown .",
    "diagrams with permutations of the gluon lines are also not shown.,width=491 ]    in the unpolarized case , to lowest order @xmath33 , one only has the gluon fusion process shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "this production mechanism dominates at small transverse momentum where the mean produced quarkonium transverse momentum is of order @xmath34 . at order @xmath35",
    ", there are much more contributions from the two - by - two scattering processes illustrated in fig.1(b ) and fig.1(c ) . in these processes",
    ", the large heavy quarkonium transverse momentum is generated by recoiling against an outgoing gluon or quark .",
    "note that heavy quarkonium production at @xmath35 from gluon gluon scattering is not shown in the fig.1 .",
    "within the so - called color singlet model  @xcite , the amplitude for the processes discussed has the general form , @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the relative momentum of the heavy quarks . here",
    ", @xmath38 is the bethe - salpeter wave function of the produced bound state .",
    "@xmath39 is the perturbative part of the diagrams shown in fig.1 with the heavy quark legs cut off . due to the non - relativistic nature of heavy quarkonium",
    ", the relative momentum is assumed to be small with respect to the quark mass @xmath40 .",
    "for the production of s - wave states , one can simply neglect the dependence of @xmath39 on the relative momentum .",
    "this leads to , @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath42 is the value of the radial s - wave function at the origin , and @xmath43 is the spin projection operator . according to the color singlet model ,",
    "the heavy quark pair produced in the partonic scattering can evolve into a quarkonium non - perturbatively only if they have the same quantum numbers as the corresponding quarkonium .",
    "this implies that the spin projector operator associated with @xmath0 production has the form , @xmath44 with these calculational recipes , one derives the unpolarized differential cross section for the gluon fusion channel  @xcite , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the rapidity of the produced bound state .",
    "@xmath47 are the unpolarized collinear gluon distribution functions of two incoming hadrons .",
    "the longitudinal momentum fractions are constrained by kinematics : @xmath48 , @xmath49 . in eq.([eq:5 ] ) , @xmath50 is given by , @xmath51 for the quark gluon scattering channel , we have  @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the unpolarized collinear quark distribution .",
    "the index @xmath54 runs over all quark flavors . for the @xmath55 channel ,",
    "the unpolarized differential cross section reads  @xcite , @xmath56 one notices that apart from the color factor , the hard coefficient appearing in the @xmath55 channel can be obtained from those of the quark gluon channel by crossing @xmath57 .",
    "the result for the gluon - gluon scattering channel can also be found in ref .",
    "next to leading order corrections to c - even hadronic quarkonium production have been calculated in refs.@xcite .",
    "production from quark gluon channel.,width=453 ]    now let s proceed to derive the polarized cross section . to generate the spin asymmetry ,",
    "one additional gluon must be exchanged between the active partons and the remanent part of the nucleon target as shown in fig.2 and fig.3",
    ". the hard part , if an additional gluon is attached , can be calculated perturbatively , while the non - perturbative part describes the relevant three parton correlations .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we only focus on the contribution in which the quark - gluon correlation in the transversely polarized nucleon enters .",
    "this is precisely the etqs function which is defined as , @xmath58 where we have suppressed wilson lines and have indicated the nucleon mass by @xmath59 .",
    "we also introduced the lightcone vector @xmath60 , whose conjugate vector is @xmath61 .",
    "note that our definition of the etqs function differs by a factor @xmath62 from the conventions used in refs .",
    "this etqs function plays an important role for ssa phenomenology .",
    "its scale evolution has been derived in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "similar to the ssa in the drell - yan process , the strong interaction phase factor necessary for having a non - vanishing spin asymmetry arises from the interference between an imaginary part of the partonic scattering amplitude with an extra gluon , as shown in fig.2 for the quark - gluon scattering channel , and the real scattering amplitude without a gluon attachment .",
    "the imaginary part is due to the pole of the parton propagator associated with the integration over the gluon momentum fraction @xmath63 .",
    "this effectively implies that one of the internal parton lines goes on shell . to isolate the imaginary part of such poles , the distribution identity : @xmath64",
    "depending on which propagator s pole contributes , the amplitude may get contributions from @xmath65 (  soft - pole \" ) and @xmath66 (  hard - pole \" )  @xcite .",
    "both types of gluon poles show up in our calculation .",
    "as the reader can find the relevant technical details for our calculation in the literature  @xcite we sketch here only some key steps of such twist-3 calculations .    as mentioned before , we carry out the calculation in the covariant gauge , in which the leading contribution of the exchanged gluon is the `` plus '' component @xmath67 .",
    "the gluon s momentum is dominated by the @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the longitudinal momentum fraction with respect to the polarized proton . in order to calculate consistently with twist-3 accuracy",
    ", one has to expand the hard parts in the gluon transverse momentum and keep the terms linear in @xmath70 .",
    "then the @xmath70 factor can be combined with @xmath67 to yield @xmath71 , which is an element of the field strength tensor @xmath72 . after adding the term proportional to @xmath73 of the same tensor  @xcite ,",
    "the soft part can be rewritten in the form of the etqs function .",

    "however , the derived complete results for the spin dependent cross sections is rather length . to highlight some interesting features of our results , in the following",
    ", we will only present the expression in the limit of large transverse momentum ( @xmath74 ) and small transverse momentum ( @xmath75 ) instead of the full expression . at large transverse momentum , after dropping all terms suppressed by powers of @xmath76 , one ends up with the polarized differential cross section for the @xmath77 channel , @xmath78\\frac{n_c}{2 } \\frac { \\hat s^2 + \\hat u^2}{-\\hat t^3 } \\right .\\",

    "first , as usual , the ssa is suppressed by the factor @xmath81 at large transverse momentum .",
    "second , one notices that the derivative term and non - derivative term from the soft gluon pole contribution can not be combined into a compact form as it can be done for the polarized cross section for pion production in hadron collisions  @xcite .",
    "also , let us note that the hard gluon pole contribution survives even though the heavy quarkonium mass is neglected , in contrast to the cases of pion and direct photon production for which the hard gluon pole contribution is absent .",
    "finally , it is observed that except for the different color factors , the soft gluon contribution in the quark gluon channel can be obtained from the quark antiquark channel by crossing @xmath82 , while the hard coefficients associated with the hard gluon pole contributions for the @xmath77 and @xmath83 channels differ by a minus sign after crossing @xmath82 .",
    "now let us discuss our results in the low transverse moment limit . in this limit , we neglect all terms suppressed by the power of @xmath84 while keeping those enhanced by the factor @xmath85 .",

    "it is interesting to note that the hard coefficient associated with the soft gluon matrix element is the well known splitting kernel @xmath91 . here , it is worthwhile to point out that no leading power contribution at small @xmath86 comes from the quark - antiquark channel .    on the other hand , when @xmath92 , transverse momentum dependent factorization can be applied . in the tmd factorization approach ,",
    "the ssa in @xmath0 production is generated by the gluon sivers function @xmath93 through the gluon - gluon fusion channel , @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the gluon sivers function .",
    "the subscript `` dy '' indicates that the gluon sivers function contains a past - pointing gauge link built up through initial state interactions , similar to that in the drell - yan process .",
    "when @xmath96 is of the order of @xmath34 , the gluon sivers function is an entirely non - perturbative object .",
    "however , in the kinematic region @xmath97 , tmd factorization still holds and at the same time the function @xmath95 can be calculated in terms of twist - three parton correlation function within perturbative qcd .",
    "it can receive contributions from both the etqs function and tri - gluon correlations . in the current case , we are interested only in the former one .",
    "our perturbative calculation follows a similar procedure as in  @xcite resulting in @xmath98 where the soft gluon pole contribution is generated by the diagram shown in the fig.4(a ) , and the hard gluon pole contribution arises from fig.4(b ) .",
    "this result was first derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , though the second term was missed there . at this point , we would like to mention that the hard gluon pole term also contributes to the scale evolution of the tri - gluon correlation for the flavor singlet case , which was overlooked in the literature previously  @xcite .",
    "in addition , due to the existence of diagram fig.4(b ) , the chiral partner of the etqs function , @xmath99 ( notation used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) also contributes to the scale evolution of tri - gluon correlations  @xcite .    by inserting eq.[gsivers ] into eq.[tmd ] and making the approximation @xmath100",
    ", we reproduce the result obtained in the collinear twist-3 approach . therefore , for the observable under consideration , we have obtained a unified picture in the kinematical region where tmd factorization and the collinear twist-3 approach both apply , as was found in many other cases  @xcite .    to end , let us briefly discuss a possible future numerical study . in order to estimate the size of ssas for @xmath0 production",
    ", we must determine the input for the etqs functions including the diagonal and off - diagonal contributions , as the polarized cross section depends on the both , soft and hard gluon pole contributions .",
    "unfortunately , the off - diagonal contributions to @xmath3 needed for this ssa observable are not as well - determined as the diagonal pieces which can be related to moments of the quark sivers function . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a gaussian form was assumed for @xmath101 with a maximum at @xmath102 .",
    "this study was done in the context of the evolution of @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analysis of higher - twist functions was conducted using light - cone wave functions that include @xmath103 fock states .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , this study found that @xmath101 reaches its maximum when @xmath104 and some of its lowest values when @xmath102 .",
    "these completely different behaviours clearly demonstrate our lack of knowledge for @xmath101",
    ". nevertheless , it would be useful to determine the potential impact of @xmath105 on the size of ssas in @xmath0 hadronic production .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the transverse single spin asymmetry in hadronic @xmath0 production by employing the collinear twist-3 approach in combination with the color singlet model .",
    "we discussed the behavior of the spin asymmetry at high and low transverse momentum .",
    "in particular , at low transverse momentum , a match between the tmd factorization approach and the collinear twist-3 formalism has been found after re - examining the derivation of the gluon sivers function at large transverse momentum . as a byproduct of this work , we identified a term , which was missed so far , that contributes also to the scale evolution of the tri - gluon correlation for the flavor singlet case . in addition , we have briefly outlined a plan for a future numerical studies .",
    "let us mention that it would be feasible to measure this asymmetry at rhic and a proposed fixed target experiment at lhc(after )  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the transverse spin physics and the heavy quarkonium production physics could mutually benefit from studying this observable as explained in the following .",
    "first of all , due to the sign mismatch issue  @xcite , a doubt on the validity of the collinear twist-3 approach in hadron collisions has arisen .",
    "ssa in heavy quarkonium production provides a clean way to test this approach , as compared to that in pion production where the collins mechanism could dominate the asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one notices that the spin asymmetry is independent of the radial wave function at the origin @xmath106 and only sensitive to the heavy quarkonium production mechanism .",
    "therefore , measuring this observable would provide us an unique chance to pin down the ratio between the values of the color singlet long distance matrix element and the color octet matrix element .",
    "there are a number of directions in which our work could be extended .",
    "first , the color octet contribution to ssa should be taken into account as it plays a role at large transverse momentum .",
    "second , it is natural and straightforward to study the ssas for other c - even heavy quarkonium production in the framework outlined in this paper .",
    "it is also possible to study ssas for hadronic @xmath107 production .",
    "to do so , we have to compute the ssas generated from the tri - gluon correlation since it is the only contribution appears at the non - trivial leading order in @xmath107 production .",
    "finally , one can calculate the ssas for photonic / electronic @xmath107 production using the collinear twist-3 approach in combination with the nrqcd framework",
    ". these would be the relevant observables at the future eic  @xcite .    *",
