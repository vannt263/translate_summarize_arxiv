    "we specifically exclude all fainter galaxies , even when their redshifts are known . using the methods described in   2 , we determine the maximum distance along each sight line to which galaxy redshift data are complete ; regions complete to 0.1@xmath6  are a small subset of the @xmath6-complete regions . because few absorbers lie in regions surveyed below 0.1@xmath6 , this is the lowest galaxy luminosity limit that permits a sufficient sample size to draw statistical inferences .",
    "our second approach uses all galaxies observed along each sight line for absorbers at distances closer than the @xmath6  or 0.1@xmath6  limits .",
    "although galaxy catalogs are well defined with a single luminosity limit , they do not use all the available redshift information .",

    "the stronger half - sample also includes 10 ly@xmath7  absorbers ( @xmath69% ) in galaxy voids , with nearest bright - galaxy neighbors @xmath70  @xmath4  mpc away ( see paper iii and drozdovsky et al .",

    "the median nearest - neighbor distance for simulated photoionized absorbers is 600  @xmath4  kpc , compared to 480  @xmath4  kpc observed for the weaker half sample .",
    "this is a reasonable match , considering that the limiting galaxy luminosities of the observations and the simulations are not precisely matched and that some photoionized absorbers may be present in the stronger half - sample .    in the entire ly@xmath7  sample ,",
    "@xmath71% of ly@xmath7  absorbers lie in voids , more than 3  @xmath4  mpc from the nearest galaxy and consistent with the @xmath72% found in our smaller sample ( paper  iii ) .",
    "this fraction is also consistent with the @xmath73% of photoionized absorbers found in voids by the simulations .",
    "however , in both simulations and observations , the pathlengths may not be the same through voids and superclusters . in our current sample ,",
    "the relative pathlengths ( 43% through voids , 57% through superclusters ) are probably representative of the local universe , since only four of our 31 targets ( mrk  335 , mrk  421 , mrk  501 , i  zw  1 ) were chosen to lie behind well - known galaxy voids .",
    "the percentage of void absorbers drops to @xmath7410% for the stronger absorbers investigated for the presence of o  vi absorption in this paper ; this is shown in figure 1 for both @xmath6  and 0.1 @xmath6  samples .",
    "the median distances between ly@xmath7  absorbers and @xmath6  galaxies ( table 1 ) are so large ( 1.12.2 @xmath4  mpc ) that is implausible to associate absorbers with individual @xmath6  galaxy halos .",
    "this is because the median distance ( 345  @xmath4  kpc ) between an @xmath6  galaxy and its nearest galaxy neighbor is a small fraction of these values , and we usually find lower luminosity galaxies between the absorber and the nearest @xmath6  galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the median distance between any two @xmath75 galaxies ( 245  @xmath4kpc ) is smaller than that between an absorber and its nearest @xmath24@xmath6  or @xmath76@xmath6  galaxy neighbor ( 625 and 335 @xmath4  kpc , respectively ) .",
    "this also makes it difficult to assign a specific galaxy at @xmath77@xmath6  to an individual absorber . comparing the cdfs for the @xmath6-complete and 0.1@xmath6-complete samples , we find that the median nearest - neighbor distances for all absorber samples scale by the expected amount if the galaxies are located randomly with respect to absorbers .",
    "for example , by extending the galaxy surveys fainter , the galaxy density is increased by an amount given by standard luminosity functions @xcite , and the nearest - neighbor distance is decreased by approximately the cube root of that amount .",
    "these last two statistical results are the primary evidence that low column density ly@xmath7  absorbers are not easily ascribed to individual galaxies but rather to supercluster filaments @xcite .",
    "gas in these absorbers is either of primordial origin or it comes from the cumulative debris of many galaxies in the filament .",
    "@xcite came to similar conclusions , using a smaller sample extending to galaxies with @xmath78 but confined to the virgo cluster .",
    "although their conclusion may be biased by the special conditions in the virgo cluster ( see   [ sec : implications ] ) , only three of our 31 sight lines pass through any portion of the virgo cluster .",
    "assigning ly@xmath7  absorbers to supercluster filaments is also consistent with numerical simulations of the low-@xmath17 ly@xmath7  forest @xcite .",
    "owing to the incompleteness of the galaxy survey data at @xmath79@xmath6 , we can not rule out the possibility that some ly@xmath7  absorbers are associated with a nearby galaxy fainter than 0.1@xmath6  ( see column  6 in table  [ nntable ] , table  [ assoctable ] , and stocke et al . 2005 ) .      using the  all - galaxies \" approach in table  [ nntable ] and figure  [ cdf ] , we find that the median distances from an absorber to the nearest galaxy in any region complete to @xmath6  or 0.1@xmath6  are comparable to the distance between galaxies in these regions . the absorber cdfs in figure  [ cdf ] are the ones that either overlap the galaxy cdf or lie to the left of it . in many cases , it may be possible to associate individual absorbers with individual galaxies , although many of these galaxies are likely to be fainter than 0.1@xmath6  ( see absolute magnitudes of nearest galaxies in table  [ assoctable ] ) .",
    "the nearest - neighbor galaxy distances for absorbers are about twice as large as predicted for shock - heated gas by numerical simulations .",

    "a subset of absorbers in ly@xmath7  pairs has even smaller nearest - neighbor distances , which are better matched to the galaxy distances in simulations .",
    "these absorbers will be defined and discussed in the next section .    because the detections and non - detections were drawn from the stronger half of the ly@xmath7  absorber sample , it is not surprising that the cdfs in the top panel of figure  [ cdf ] for these three samples are similar .",

    "this result is expected because of the finite distances that metals can be spread away from galaxies in the current - day universe @xcite .",

    "the fact that they found in a significant fraction of cases shows that these ions are associated kinematically with the h  i. physical modeling suggests that these ions exist in a multi - phase medium , in which the hot gas and warm photoionized gas share the same velocity range , but are not cospatial .",
    "such situations could arise in conductive interfaces , in cooling shocks , or in turbulent mixing layers . in our baryon surveys , the ly@xmath7  census counts warm photoionized baryons ( 30% of @xmath154 ) and the census counts a portion of the hot ( whim ) baryons ( 510% of @xmath154 ) .    our arguments in ",
    "4.2 about shock - heating suggest that absorbers in ly@xmath7  pairs are collisionally - ionized gas at @xmath162  k. the other half of the sample probably also includes shock - heated gas with low radial - velocity components , as well as some low - density ( @xmath163 @xmath32 ) photoionized ( @xmath164  k ) gas .",

    "this velocity difference suggests a physical origin of some absorbers in shock - heated gas .",
    "we now elaborate on these overall conclusions and their implications . in general , the median distance between any two @xmath76@xmath6  galaxies is less than the median distance from the absorbers to the nearest @xmath76@xmath6  galaxy ( table  [ nntable ] , column  5 ) .",
    "thus , it is often difficult to determine which galaxy , if any , is the source of the gas in the absorber , a result consistent with numerical simulations @xcite . a more sensible picture places the ly@xmath7  absorbers within supercluster filaments .",
    "the nearest - neighbor statistics for both and absorbers place them sufficiently close to individual galaxies that some could be associated with winds or halos .",
    "because few absorber regions have been surveyed below 0.1@xmath6 , we can not exclude the possibility that metal - line absorbers are associated with undiscovered faint galaxies .",

    "this type of absorber shares some observational similarities with galactic hvcs @xcite . the sample in ly@xmath7",
    "pairs is substantial , with 5 pairs per unit redshift at low-@xmath17 .",
    "these absorptions are sufficient to account for most or all of the excess power seen in the two - point correlation function of ly@xmath7  absorbers ( paper  iv ) .    guided by the maximum extent to which",
    "metals are spread from galaxies , we define a filament - absorber association for systems @xmath93  @xmath4  kpc from the nearest galaxy , in regions surveyed down to at least @xmath6 . because filaments are typically 57  @xmath4  mpc across @xcite , the nearest galaxy usually lies well within the filament .",
    "our estimate of 800  @xmath4  kpc is a reasonable choice , given the average density of galaxies within a filament . from our results of   3.3 , we envision an empirical model for a supercluster filament in the local universe , composed of three generic regions : ( 1 ) region # 1 ( 3350% coverage ) composed of metal - enriched ( @xmath122 $ ] @xmath123 ) absorbers ; ( 2 ) regions # 2 ( 1625% coverage ) of low metallicity absorbers ; and ( 3 ) regions # 3 ( 2550% coverage ) of unknown metallicity , owing to weak or non - detections of ly@xmath7",
    ".    our previous work led us to conclude that weaker ly@xmath7  absorbers are only loosely associated with galaxies ( see figure 1 ) and may represent a population of uniformly distributed absorbers ( paper  iii ) .",
    "we propose here that the weaker ly@xmath7  absorbers lie in regions of low - metallicity and should be added to the accounting of region # 2 . in @xmath48  k gas , with neutral fraction @xmath172 , the whim produces broad , shallow ly@xmath7  absorption .",
    "therefore , the ly@xmath7   non - detections might be metal - rich regions too hot to be seen in ly@xmath7  absorption , but visible in _ chandra _ spectra of high - ionization metal - line absorptions @xcite .",
    "the extent of metal transport calculated above refers to the spread of gas of @xmath12 metallicity from galaxies in the current epoch .",
    "absorbers more than 1  @xmath4  mpc from galaxies may all contain gas at @xmath134}\\approx -1.5 $ ] in the current epoch or they may be metal - free .",
