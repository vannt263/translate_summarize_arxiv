    "one of the main selling points for a railgun is , that it can convert large quantities of electrical energy into kinetic energy of a projectile .",
    "at the same time it was repeatedly demonstrated that muzzle velocities of 2.5km / s can be realized .",
    "these two capabilities uniquely qualify railguns as a candidate for a long range artillery system .",
    "one of the military platforms , where such a gun could be deployed on , is a larger ship , i.e. a future all - electric frigate or destroyer . in an all - electric ship , the electrical engine needs to be able to accelerate these large ships to velocities of 20kn to 30kn , thus requiring an electrical power of somewhere between 30mw to 100mw . as most of the time",
    ", the ship will not need all of its installed power for the drive system , it is natural to equip such a vessel with electrical weapons .",
    "the railgun and the high energy laser are prime candidates for such new , electrical weapon systems .",
    "when looking at these two systems , the railgun is closely related to the traditional artillery guns being mounted on the current ships .",
    "it launches a projectile on a ballistic trajectory , with the only difference to use a magnetic field instead of gun powder as propellant . as a railgun uses constant acceleration over the barrel length it can achieve higher muzzle velocities than conventional guns of the same length .",
    "this higher velocity , in combination with a hypersonic projectile design , translates into a greatly extended range . from the capabilities point of view",
    ", a railgun can do all what a conventional gun can do , but better .",
    "the navies of the european union member states have a combined fleet of about 110 frigates and destroyers currently in service @xcite . in the future",
    ", these will have to be gradually replaced by modern vessels with an electric drive . even so the total number of ships might shrink due to budget constraints",
    ", there is clearly a large market for railgun equipped ships . in this study , it is attempted to develop the key parameters of a railgun system that is needed to match and exceed the capabilities of current shipboard artillery .",
    "in addition flight behavior of a first draft for a hypersonic projectile is evaluated using standard software for preliminary missile design .",
    "in france and germany , there is no clear distinction in name between frigates and destroyers .",
    "instead both types are referred to as frigates .",
    "the frigates of both navies are mainly equipped with two calibers for the main gun .",
    "most of the french vessels have a 100 mm caliber cannon , named `` modele 68 '' or a variant of it mounted @xcite .",
    "the german frigates are equipped with the smaller 76 mm caliber gun from oto - melara @xcite .",
    "table [ current_art ] lists the most important parameters for these two weapons .",
    "the ratio of the projectile to total round mass is about 50% to 56% .",
    "the standard ammunition for these guns uses an explosive warhead .",
    "therefore the amount of carried explosive determines the amount of energy delivered to the target . as an estimate for this energy level",
    "one can use the energy content of tnt and scale it by the weight of the bursting - charge .",
    "for the 76 mm gun , the energy released at the target is about 2mj , while the 100 mm gun delivers 4mj .",
    "of course these two numbers are only a superficial criterion , as another important parameter is the accuracy with which a target can be hit .",
    "even so there is not an a priori reason , as to why railguns could not be used to launch explosive rounds , there is a certain charm in the idea to use the large velocity delivered by railguns to cause the destruction at the target by kinetic energy only .",
    "this has the advantage , that it eliminates the need for the costly chain of production , storage , delivery and handling of explosives in addition to reduce the vulnerability of the vessel . for a comparable effect to the existing armament of the current naval vessels ,",
    "the amount of kinetic energy with which a railgun projectile needs to impact is of the order of 2mj to 4mj .",
    "using an explosive warhead would allow to strongly reduce the impact and therefore the muzzle velocity .",
    "the artillery range capabilities of the current european ships are of the order of several tens of kilometers .",
    ".[current_art ] key parameters of current french and german standard naval guns ( data from @xcite ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     starting with a review of current , conventional marine artillery systems , the key parameters of a first draft for a possible railgun implementation were determined .",
    "the flight parameters of the projectile were calculated using standard aerodynamic and flight mechanic software .",
    "the results of this study are that a 100 mm square caliber railgun with a barrel length of 6.4 m is able to accelerate 8 kg heavy launch packages .",
    "depending on the launching angle , the 5 kg projectile will have a reach of up to 500 km .",
    "for this , the required primary electrical energy is of the order of 75mj .",
    "such a system would open up new ship artillery system capabilities .",
    "further parameters of this gun are summarized in table [ key_parameters ] .",
    "it is the intention of the authors that the results of this study serve as a starting point for further discussions and studies about the capabilities and parameters of a future european shipboard railgun .",
    "part of this research was financed by the french ministry of defense ( dga ) .",
