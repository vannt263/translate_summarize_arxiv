    "inverse problems for quantum graphs , i.e.  differential operators on metric graphs , is an area which has attracted much interest during the last decade .",
    "particular attention was paid to the problem of recovering a differential operator from the titchmarsh ",
    "weyl function on a selected set of vertices , see  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of ordinary or partial differential operators the titchmarsh  weyl function for a quantum graph does not contain the full information on the differential operator on the graph .",
    "this effect is caused by the existence of real resonances for the graph obtained from attaching infinite leads to the vertices of @xmath0 ; they materialize through eigenfunctions which vanish at all vertices of the graph .",
    "their existence can be also be understood as a lack of a unique continuation property for quantum graphs .",
    "in this paper we consider as a model operator the laplacian @xmath1 on a finite metric graph @xmath0 subject to continuity and kirchhoff conditions on all vertices ; see section  [ sec : preliminaries ] for the details .",
    "our aim is to study the relation between the ( purely discrete ) spectrum @xmath2 of @xmath1 and the poles of the titchmarsh ",
    "weyl function for a sufficiently large set of vertices . for any subset @xmath3 of the vertex set of @xmath0 the matrix - valued titchmarsh ",
    "weyl function can be defined via the relation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is any solution of @xmath6 on @xmath0 which is continuous on each vertex and satisfies the kirchhoff condition on any vertex which does not belong to @xmath7 ; here @xmath8 is the sum of the derivatives at a vertex @xmath9 of the restrictions of @xmath5 to the edges incident to @xmath9 . there is a close relation between the eigenvalues of @xmath1 and the poles of the meromorphic matrix function @xmath10 , see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3.5.3 ) .",
    "in fact , each pole of @xmath11 is an eigenvalue of @xmath1 , but the converse is not true in general if cycles with commensurate edges are present , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the case where the vertex set @xmath7 is rather large .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 contains all vertices of degree one as well as all _ proper core vertices _ ; cf .  definition  [ def : core ] .",
    "we define the number @xmath12 where @xmath13 equals either @xmath14 or @xmath15 depending on properties of the edge lengths in  @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the largest unit of length with respect to which the edges in @xmath16 have integer lengths ; see section  [ sec : resonances ] for more detail . in the main result of this paper",
    "we show that any eigenvalue of @xmath1 below @xmath18 is visible ( including its multiplicity ) for the titchmarsh ",
    "weyl function :",
    "for any @xmath19 the equivalence @xmath20 holds and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the residue of the meromorphic matrix function  @xmath11 at @xmath23 ; cf .  section  [ sec : m ] .",
    "moreover , we show that this bound is optimal .",
    "in fact , we show that the number @xmath24 is an eigenvalue of @xmath1 such that   is violated whenever @xmath18 is finite , and we provide an example where @xmath18 is not a pole of @xmath11 but a removable singularity .",
    "however , we would like to mention that eigenvalues satisfying   and   may also exist above @xmath18 .    in the proof of our main result theorem  [ thm : visibility ] we trace the relations   and   back to considerations on resonances of @xmath0 .",
    "the core piece of our proof is theorem  [ thm : general ] , which states that the number @xmath18 in   is in fact the smallest real resonance of @xmath0 if @xmath18 is finite and that no real resonances exist if @xmath18 is infinite .",
    "we believe that theorem  [ thm : general ] may be of independent interest .",
    "we would like to mention that a connection between the existence of resonance eigenfunctions ( so - called scars ) and cycles with commensurate edges was already observed in  @xcite .",
    "for further work related to resonances and scars for quantum graphs we refer the reader to  @xcite and the references therein . moreover ,",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for genericity of simple eigenvalues and corresponding properties of edge lengths .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we provide preliminaries on discrete and metric graphs , laplacians and resonances .",
    "section  [ sec : resonances ] contains theorem  [ thm : general ] on the smallest real resonance as well as several examples which illustrate the calculation of @xmath18 and indicate that a large number of eigenvalues may lie below @xmath18 .",

    "a _ ( discrete ) graph _ @xmath0 consists of a nonempty set of edges @xmath25 , a nonempty set of vertices @xmath26 , and an incidence function @xmath27 which assigns an unordered pair of ( not necessarily distinct ) vertices to each edge ; if a vertex @xmath28 is a member of the pair @xmath29 for an edge @xmath30 we say that @xmath31 is _ incident _ to @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , we say that an edge @xmath31 is a _ loop _ if the two members of @xmath29 coincide .",
    "the _ degree _ of a vertex @xmath28 is the number of edges incident to @xmath9 where each loop is counted twice .",
    "a _ walk _ in @xmath0 is a tuple @xmath32 whose entries are alternately vertices and edges such that for each @xmath33 the vertices @xmath34 and @xmath35 are precisely those two to which @xmath36 is incident . for two walks @xmath37 in @xmath0",
    "we write @xmath38 if @xmath39 is a subtuple consisting of consecutive entries of @xmath40 .",
    "a walk @xmath41 of the form   is called _ closed _ if @xmath42 holds .",
    "if , in addition , the vertices @xmath43 are distinct then @xmath41 is called a _",
    "cycle_. a graph @xmath0 is called _ connected _ if for each two vertices @xmath44 there exists a walk in @xmath0 starting at @xmath9 and terminating at @xmath45 ; for simplicity throughout this paper we will only consider connected graphs .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 is called _ finite _ if the sets @xmath26 and @xmath25 are finite . in this paper",
    "we consider only finite graphs and denote by @xmath46 and @xmath47 the number of vertices and edges , respectively , of @xmath0 .",
    "let us shortly recall some fundamentals on laplacians on metric graphs ; for more details see the recent monographs  @xcite or the survey  @xcite .",
    "a _ metric graph _ is a graph @xmath0 together with a length function @xmath48 such that each edge @xmath30 is identified with the interval @xmath49 $ ] , where the endpoints @xmath50 and @xmath51 are identified with the two vertices to which @xmath31 is incident . in the following all graphs",

    "moreover , we write @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the sobolev space of order @xmath62 on @xmath63 .",
    "note that any @xmath64 is continuous on @xmath63 and @xmath65 has a continuous extension to @xmath49 $ ] for each @xmath30 .",
    "we say that a function @xmath66 is _ continuous on @xmath0 _ if for each two edges @xmath31 and @xmath67 which are incident to a joint vertex @xmath9 the limits of @xmath59 and @xmath68 at  @xmath9 coincide .",
    "accordingly we define @xmath69 for @xmath70 we write @xmath71 for the limit of @xmath59 at @xmath9 for an arbitrary edge @xmath31 incident to @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath72 we use the abbreviation @xmath73 for the sum of the derivatives pointing outwards ; here the evaluations of the derivatives must be understood as limits .",
    "the differential operator under consideration in this paper is the laplacian in  @xmath56 equipped with continuity and kirchhoff conditions at all vertices , i.e.  the _ kirchhoff laplacian _ @xmath1 in @xmath56 given by @xmath74 the operator @xmath1 is selfadjoint in @xmath56 and its spectrum @xmath2 is nonnegative and consists of isolated eigenvalues with finite multiplicities ; the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath1 equals zero and corresponds to those eigenfunctions which are constant on  @xmath0 .    in the following the notion of a ( real ) resonance of @xmath0 plays an important role .",
    "we make the following definition .",
    "[ def : resonance ] let @xmath1 be the kirchhoff laplacian in @xmath56 .",

    "each such @xmath5 is called _",
    "resonance eigenfunction_.    some remarks are in order .",
    "the classical definition of a resonance for ( the laplacian on ) a metric graph refers to graphs which contain infinite leads , i.e.  edges of infinite length attached to some vertices ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "a resonance for such a non - compact graph is defined as a number @xmath78 such that there exists a nontrivial solution @xmath5 of @xmath79 on @xmath0 which satisfies the continuity and kirchhoff condition at each vertex and is a scalar multiple of @xmath80 on each infinite lead .",
    "it can be seen easily that a resonance must satisfy @xmath81 , and it may happen that a resonance @xmath62 is real . if @xmath0 is a finite metric graph and @xmath82 is the non - compact graph obtained from attaching infinite leads to each vertex of @xmath0 then it can be shown that @xmath62 is a real resonance of @xmath82 in the classical sense if and only if @xmath83 is a resonance of @xmath0 in the sense of definition  [ def : resonance ] .",
    "we work with @xmath83 instead of @xmath62 since for our purposes this choice is more convenient .",
    "note that also with respect to our definition a resonance of @xmath0 is nonzero ( and , thus , positive ) as the eigenfunctions of @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath84 are necessarily different from zero at each vertex .",
    "in this section we provide an explicit formula for the smallest real resonance of a finite metric graph @xmath0 in terms of its connectivity and algebraic properties of the edge lengths .    in order to formulate the main result of this section",
    "some preparation is needed . for any closed walk @xmath85 in @xmath0",
    "we denote by @xmath86 its total length .",
    "note that for each closed walk of the form   exactly one of the following alternatives holds true : either two of the edges @xmath87 have rationally independent lengths or the edges @xmath87 are commensurate , i.e.  pairwise rationally dependent . in the latter case there exists ( a non - unique ) @xmath88 with @xmath89 such that @xmath90 are natural numbers for @xmath91 .",
    "we denote the largest such @xmath92 by @xmath93 .",

    "in other words , @xmath93 is the largest unit of length with respect to which the lengths of all edges in @xmath41 are integers .",
    "note that @xmath38 implies @xmath95 .",
    "according to the definition of @xmath93 we say that @xmath96 in the statement of the following theorem we say that a closed walk @xmath41 in @xmath0 is _ non - multiple _ if there exists an edge which appears exactly once in @xmath41 .",
    "note that , in particular , each cycle is a non - multiple closed walk .",
    "moreover , we say that a cycle @xmath16 has _ commensurate edges _ if all its edge lengths are commensurate . for an illustration of the conditions in the definition of @xmath13 we refer the reader to example  [ example2 ] below .",
    "[ thm : general ] let @xmath0 be a finite , connected metric graph .",
    "for each cycle @xmath16 in @xmath0 with commensurate edges define @xmath97 if the expression @xmath98 is finite then @xmath18 is the smallest real resonance of @xmath0 ; otherwise @xmath0 has no real resonance .",
    "note first that @xmath99 if and only if @xmath0 does not contain any cycle with commensurate edges . in this case",
    "it follows from a reasoning as in  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the following main part of the proof is carried out in two steps . in step  1",
    "we show that any real resonance of @xmath0 satisfies @xmath101 . afterwards in step  2",

    "we distinguish two cases ; for this note that the support of @xmath5 contains at least one cycle and that each cycle contained in the support of @xmath5 has commensurate edges ; cf .",

    "note that with this abbreviation the kirchhoff condition @xmath115 at a vertex @xmath9 can be rewritten as @xmath116 our construction of a non - multiple closed walk is done by carrying out the following algorithm .    1",

    "thus @xmath176 .",
    "moreover , @xmath177 would imply @xmath178 , which again contradicts  .",
    "hence @xmath179 .",
    "since @xmath180 , this contradicts the construction of @xmath41 .",
    "second , consider the case @xmath181 , i.e. , @xmath162 . assume for a contradiction that @xmath182 for some @xmath169",

    "in fact , we even have @xmath189 since @xmath190 together with   would contradict the choice of @xmath155 .",
    "hence due to   the construction algorithm of @xmath41 would terminate with @xmath191 and thus @xmath192 would be the last edge in @xmath41 , a contradiction .",
    "consequently , @xmath41 is a non - multiple closed walk with commensurate edges and contains the cycle  @xmath16 in  .",
    "let us now prove the claim @xmath101 . note that by   there exist @xmath193 such that @xmath194 in particular , @xmath195 for @xmath196 with @xmath111 .",
    "since @xmath113 by assumption and @xmath197 is a non - multiple closed walk with commensurate edges , it follows that @xmath198 or @xmath41 has odd length .",
