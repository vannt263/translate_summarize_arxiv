    "detached eclipsing binary star systems ( debs ) are our primary source of measurements of the physical properties of stars .",
    "the masses , radii , and surface gravities of stars in debs can be measured empirically , and to a precision and accuracy of 1% or better ( e.g.  southworth et al . , 2005b , 2007 ) .",
    "with an effective temperature measurement we can obtain their luminosities directly .",
    "debs are the main checks and calibrators for theoretical stellar models ( e.g.  pols et al . , 1998 ) , and thus form the foundation of stellar and galactic astrophysics .",
    "other important uses of debs include as direct distance indicators ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2013 ; southworth et al . , 2005a ) ,",
    "calibrators of asteroseismic scaling relations ( frandsen et al . , 2013 ) ,",
    "probes of the chemical evolution of massive stars ( pavlovski et al . , 2009 ) , tracers of binary evolutionary processes ( maxted et al . , 2013 ) , and characterisation of the host stars of transiting extrasolar planets ( southworth , 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "the study of debs has a long history ( see stebbins , 1911 ; russell , 1912 ) .",
    "catalogues of well - studied systems have been published by popper ( 1967 ) , popper ( 1980 ) , harmanec ( 1988 ) , andersen ( 1991 ) and more recently by torres et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "in early 2006 i constructed a catalogue of well - studied debs by updating the list of objects compiled by andersen ( 1991 ) . from this point",
    "onwards new results from refereed journals have been added as and when they are published .",
    "the result is , which is available at : ` http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/debcat/ ` .",
    "a changelog has been kept since february 2008 .",
    "the total number of objects in is currently 171 . for comparison , torres et al .",
    "( 2010 ) list 94 debs .",
    "the requirements for inclusion in debcat are : ( 1 ) the evolution of the system has not been significantly affected by binarity , which restricts us to detached binary systems ; ( 2 ) measurements of the effective temperatures of both stars are available ; ( 3 ) the masses and radii of both components have been measured directly , i.e.  without significant input from stellar theory , and to an accuracy of 2% .",
    "this restricts us almost entirely to double - lined debs .",
    "the 2% limit is relaxed for a few interesting objects .",
    "in future i will continue to maintain debcat , add measurements of the orbital eccentricity and apsidal motion period , lodge a version with the _ centre de donns astronomiques de strasbourg _ ( cds ) , and redesign the website ( currently created from ascii files by a fortran77 code ) .",
    "current and future space missions , such as _ kepler _ , k2 , tess and plato , should result in a huge increase in the number of well - studied debs suitable for inclusion in debcat .",
