    "local operators containing both heavy and light quark fields exhibit an interesting behaviour under renormalization at scales below the heavy - quark mass @xmath0 .",
    "large logarithms of the type @xmath1 arise from the exchange of gluons that are `` hard '' with respect to the light quark but `` soft '' with respect to the heavy quark .",
    "since such gluons see the heavy quark as a static colour source , the large logarithms can be summed to all orders in perturbation theory using an effective theory for static heavy quarks , the so - called heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite@xcite . in the hqet ,",

    "light operators in the hqet is called `` hybrid '' renormalization .",
    "operators in the effective theory have a different evolution than in usual qcd .",
    "for instance , whereas the vector current @xmath6 is conserved in qcd ( i.e.  its anomalous dimension vanishes ) , the corresponding current @xmath7 in the hqet has a nontrivial anomalous dimension @xcite@xcite , which governs the evolution for scales below the heavy - quark mass .",
    "it has been calculated at the two - loop order in refs .",
    "the renormalization of higher - dimensional heavy ",
    "light operators is known only at the leading logarithmic order @xcite@xcite . here",
    "we shall generalize these results and perform the calculation of the anomalous dimension matrix of local dimension-4 operators at the two - loop order .",
    "this calculation requires the evaluation of two - loop tensor integrals in the hqet that are infrared ( ir ) singular when one of the external lines is taken on - shell .",
    "a general algorithm to calculate these integrals has been developed recently @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of local dimension-4 heavy ",
    "light operators appear at order @xmath8 in the heavy - quark expansion of heavy - meson decay constants @xcite and weak transition form factors @xcite . as such",
    ", they play an important role in many phenomenological applications of the hqet .",
    "the theoretical predictions for weak decay form factors involve operator matrix elements renormalized at the scale @xmath0 .",
    "our results can then be used to rewrite these matrix elements in terms of ones renormalized at a scale @xmath9 , which may be identified with the scale at which a nonperturbative evaluation of these matrix elements is performed .",
    "details of such applications will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we start by constructing , in the hqet , a basis of local dimension-4 operators containing a heavy and a light quark field . since ultimately our interest is in the matrix elements of these operators between physical hadron states , it is sufficient to consider gauge - invariant operators that do not vanish by the equations of motions @xcite",
    ". then , in the limit where the light - quark mass is set to zero , any dimension-4 operator must contain a covariant derivative acting on one of the quark fields .",
    "a basis of such operators , which closes under renormalization , is provided by and @xmath10 . ]",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 represents an arbitrary dirac matrix , which may or may not contain the lorentz index @xmath13 .",
    "the feynman rules of the hqet ensure that no dirac matrices appear on the right - hand side of @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath14 only an even number of @xmath15 matrices can appear on the left - hand side of @xmath12 .    the equations of motion , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , imply that between physical states the operators @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be replaced by total derivatives of some lower - dimensional operators , which are renormalized multiplicatively and irrespective of their dirac structure .",
    "the additional power of the external momentum carried by the operators does not affect the ultraviolet ( uv ) behaviour of loop diagrams .",
    "moreover , the reparametrization invariance of the hqet @xcite ensures that also the multiplicative renormalization of the operator @xmath21 is determined by the same @xmath22 factor that governs the renormalization of dimension-3 operators @xcite . however , there is a nontrivial mixing between @xmath21 and the other three operators .",
    "we define a matrix @xmath23 of renormalization constants , which absorb the uv divergences in the matrix elements of the bare operators , by the relation @xmath24 .",
    "then the matrix @xmath15  of the anomalous dimensions , which govern the scale dependence of the renormalized operators , is given by @xmath25 from the arguments presented above , it follows that the matrix @xmath26 has the structure @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the renormalization constant of local dimension-3 currents , which is known at the two - loop order @xcite@xcite . here",
    "we will calculate the remaining entries in the matrix @xmath23 with the same accuracy .    in a minimal subtraction scheme ,",
    "the renormalization constants are defined to remove the @xmath29 poles arising in the calculation of the bare green functions with insertions of the operators @xmath30 in dimensional regularization , i.e.  in @xmath31 space - time dimensions .",
    "hence , @xmath32 the requirement that the anomalous dimension matrix be finite in the limit @xmath33 implies the relations @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath36 function .",
    "the first equation shows that the anomalous dimension matrix can be obtained from the coefficient of the @xmath29 pole in @xmath23 , whereas the second one implies a nontrivial constraint on the coefficient of the @xmath37 pole , arising at two - loop and higher order .",
    "previous authors have calculated the renormalization constants @xmath38 appearing in ( [ zmat ] ) at the one - loop order , finding that @xcite @xmath39 this information is sufficient to reconstruct the matrix @xmath23 at order @xmath40 . from the second relation in ( [ magic ] ) , it then follows that @xmath41 here @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the colour factors for an @xmath45 gauge group , and @xmath46 is the number of light - quark flavours .",
    "this relation will provide a check on our two - loop results .",
    "the equations of motion impose two additional conditions on the renormalization constants . substituting @xmath47 or @xmath48 in the bare operator @xmath21 in ( [ ops ] ) , and using that between physical states @xmath49 ,",
    "whereas @xmath50 $ ] is renormalized multiplicatively , we find that @xmath51 where it is understood that in the second relation all pole terms proportional to @xmath52 must cancel . in terms of the constants @xmath38",
    ", we obtain the conditions @xmath53      + 2 z_4^{(2 ) } = 0 \\,,~~ \\label{eomb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which will provide a highly nontrivial check on our two - loop results",
    ". relations ( [ eom ] ) allow to calculate two of the three constants @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 in terms of the third one .",
    "the fact that the calculation of one of these constants suffices to reconstruct the full matrix @xmath23 , using that @xmath28 is fixed by reparametrization invariance , has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , the relations derived there are not fully correct beyond the one - loop order .",
    "to obtain the renormalization constants @xmath38 at order @xmath57 , we calculate the insertions of the operator @xmath21 into the amputated green function with a heavy and a light quark to two - loop order .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown in figure  [ fig:2loop ] . we need to keep terms linear in the momentum @xmath58 of the light quark , as only those contribute to the renormalization constants @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "however , for completeness we will also keep terms linear in the heavy - quark momentum @xmath59 , which contribute to @xmath28 . in that way we will reproduce the known two - loop result for @xmath28 as a check of our calculation . because the pole parts are polynomial in the external momenta , we can first take a derivative with respect to @xmath58 and @xmath60 and then set @xmath61 , so that all integrals are of propagator type and depend on the single variable @xmath62 .",
    "however , this method fails for some of the diagrams , for which setting @xmath61 after differentiation leads to ir divergences . in these cases ,",
    "we apply a variant of the so - called @xmath63 operation @xcite , which compensates these ir poles by a construction of counterterms for the ir divergent subgraphs .",
    "consider , as an example , the first diagram in figure  [ fig:2loop ] .",
    "its contribution is proportional to the integral @xmath64 when linearizing this expression in @xmath58 , we encounter an ir divergence from the region @xmath65 , which can be removed by adding and subtracting the ir subtraction term @xmath66 the difference @xmath67 can be evaluated using a naive linearization in @xmath58 , since the behaviour of the ir subtraction term for @xmath65 is the same as that of the original integral .",
    "however , because the expansion of @xmath68 involves tadpole integrals that vanish in dimensional regularization , the difference @xmath69 coincides with the naive linearization of the original expression for @xmath70 .",
    "the contribution @xmath68 , which is necessary to subtract the ir subdivergence of the original diagram , factorizes into an ir counterterm ( the @xmath71 integral ) and the original diagram with the lines of the ir sensitive subgraph removed , and with @xmath71 and @xmath58 set to zero .",
