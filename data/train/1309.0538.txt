    "modern applications demand more compact , more noise tolerant , and faster ob based devices that can operate under lower power thresholds over a wide range of multistability .",

    "the effect of sgc is due to a counterintuitive role played by the vacuum modes .",

    "our idea exploits first the enhancement of local intensity of light by the defect modes of the dopant atoms in the central layer of the pc , and second it exploits the additional enhancement of nonlinear response of the atoms by sgc .",
    "both the enhanced intensity and nonlinear response are translated into three orders of magnitude lowering of threshold power to reach ob regime incontrast to the case without sgc .",
