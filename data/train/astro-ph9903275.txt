    "the possibility that agn might drive powerful nuclear winds dates back at least to weymann _ et al .  _",
    "more recently , this idea has been revived by smith ( 1993 , 1996 ) to explain the kinematics of the nlr and as a mechanism for cloud confinement .",
    "in a very provocative paper , bicknell _ et al .  _",

    "( 1998 ) conclude that the outflows must be dominated by thermal plasma .",
    "this is an idea which is clearly deserving of far more study .",
    "if correct , it would replace the still unanswered question `` why are some objects radio - loud and others radio - quiet ? '' with another : `` why are some jets dominated by nonthermal plasma ? ''",
    "most ulirgs are inferred to possess large quantities ( @xmath68 ) of high - density gas ( @xmath69 ) , characterized by large velocity dispersions ( @xmath70 up to @xmath71 ) ; see tacconi , this volume .",
    "this implies that the energy dissipation rate within the ism is very large : dimensionally , e_kin~^3 ~610 ^ 42(m10 ^ 9 ) r^-1_100 _ 7 ^ 3where @xmath72 pc , @xmath73 , and the coefficient @xmath74 ( maclow 1998 ) .",
    "since the total non - rotational kinetic energy of the ism is e_kin~12m^2 ~10 ^ 56(m10 ^ 9)_7 ^ 2 the energy loss timescale is ~~510 ^ 5 r_100_7 equivalently , since the inferred area filling factor of dense ism in ulirgs is close to unity ( scoville , yun , & bryant 1997 ) , the energy loss timescale ( assuming strongly dissipative collisions ) @xmath75 @xmath76 yr , essentially identical with the above estimate .",
    "since the energy dissipation timescale is much shorter than the probable lifetime of the ulirg , the random bulk motions of the ism must be continuously powered .",
    "as noted in  4 , the mechanical energy input from supernovae for a @xmath77  ulirg is ~310",
    "^ 43(1 ) ( 10 ^ 51 ) which is adequate to supply the necessary kinetic energy provided that a substantial fraction is absorbed by the dense ism ( and that momentum transfer to the clouds is reasonably efficient ) ; given the large area covering factors inferred in ulirgs ( scoville _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , this seems quite reasonable .",
    "supporting the mechanical luminosity of the ism requires either ( 1 ) relatively efficient conversion of radiation to mechanical energy , or ( 2 ) , mechanical ( momentum ) input from an agn wind , as discussed above , with @xmath78 .",
    "as we have just seen , there is enough _ energy _ available from either a starburst or an agn to maintain the energy loss rates estimated for the ism in ulirgs .",
    "a related topic is the _ momentum _ input rate .",

    "( 1995 ) suggested that radiation pressure might contribute significantly to the support of the gas against gravity in the @xmath79 ulirg f10214 + 4724 , in order to reconcile the co - derived gas mass with a dynamical mass ( estimated from the co source size and line width ) which is an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "assume that a cloud at radius @xmath80 absorbs all of the incident flux ( and therefore photon momentum ) incident upon it from the central source of radiation . in equilibrium ,",
    "the condition that the radiation provide enough pressure to support the cloud against gravity is just = l4r^2 c where @xmath81 is the total mass enclosed within radius @xmath80 , @xmath82 is the mean atomic weight in units of the hydrogen mass , and  is the hydrogen column density through the cloud .",
    "simple rearrangement shows that the cloud column density which can be supported is n_^rad~l4 g cm 3.510 ^ 22(l / m10 ^ 3)which depends on the luminosity to mass ratio , here expressed in solar units .",
    "( note that although i have done the calculation by balancing the radial gravitational attraction against the radiation pressure from a central source , the identical result is obtained by calculating the column which can be _ vertically _ supported above a radiating slab , which may be a more relevant geometry for starburst - powered ulirgs ) .",
    "the limiting column density which can be supported is much smaller ( by a factor @xmath83 ) than the area - averaged molecular column densities which have been derived in the nuclei of ulirgs , for which the values of @xmath84 generally lie in the range @xmath85 , suggesting that radiation pressure support is not important .",
    "the expression for the critical column ( 28 ) assumes that the photons give up all of their momentum immediately , in other words , it has been assumed that the ism is optically thin to the re - radiated photons ( generally in the mid- to far - infrared ) .",
    "if the ism is optically thick to these photons , then multiple scattering of the radiation will occur .",
    "however , this will _ not _ increase the column which can be supported .",
    "assume that the medium is very optically thick , so that a large number of scatterings occur .",
    "in this case the radiation field will become nearly isotropic .",
    "the degree of anisotropy ( which determines how much work the radiation field can do against gravity ) is then set by the net flux outward ; this is ( in spherical geometry ) precisely @xmath86 , and so the value of @xmath87 is unaltered .",
    "in any model for ulirgs , an inevitable result is that the pressure in the ism must be extremely high :    * simply from the derived gas densities and observed turbulent velocities , the inferred turbulent pressures must be high : ~510 ^ 8(n10 ^ 4)(_turb30)^2 . * if the nuclear ( @xmath88 pc ) ism essentially radiates like a blackbody , as proposed by downes & solomon ( 1998 ) , then the radiation pressure in this region p_rad = u3~12r^2 c ( where @xmath89 is the radiation energy density ) and so therefore p_rad~310 ^ 8 l_12 r_100 ^ -2 . * in an agn - powered ulirg , the pressure of radiation from the central source of luminosity will force the gas pressure to large values : p_rad~810 ^ 7(f_abs0.1 ) l_12 r_100 ^ -2where @xmath90 is the fraction of the incident radiation which is absorbed in a thickness @xmath91 , the cloud radius ( see barvainis _ et al .  _ 1997 ) . * in a starburst - powered ulirg , with enough energy input from sne to drive a superwind , the pressure in the injection region ( on the spatial scale of the starburst ) is p_o~0.1m^1/2l_^1/2 r_^-2 ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ) where @xmath92 is the radius of the starburst region ; hence p_o~310 ^ 8 ( ) ( 10 ^ 43.5)(r_100)^-2 .",
    "all of these estimates agree to order of magnitude , implying that the pressure in the ism @xmath93 in ulirgs .",
    "this is @xmath0 orders of magnitude larger than the pressure in the average ism in the solar neighborhood ; only the densest cloud cores approach such high pressures .",
    "similarly high pressures have been inferred in more modest starburst galaxies such as ngc 1808 and ngc 3256 ( aalto _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the power input from an ob association in the form of radiation , stellar winds , and supernovae is ~610 ^ 35 n_*(mccray & kafatos 1987 ) where @xmath94 is the number of stars in the association with @xmath95 . for lower and upper stellar mass cutoffs of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively , ( which gives 1 sne for every @xmath98 turned into stars ) the energy input to the cloud from which the association formed over the cloud s lifetime @xmath6 is ~510 ^ 51(_*0.01 ) ( m_c10 ^ 5)(t10 ^ 7 ) where @xmath99 is the cloud mass and @xmath27 is the star formation efficiency as before .",

    "thus , in principle , only a few percent of the available power needs to be input to the cloud in order to disperse it ( see williams & mckee 1997 ) .",
    "however , most of this energy will of course be radiated away .",
    "if the clouds in the ism have a direct view of the active nucleus , then the integrated energy input ( assuming @xmath101 the lifetime of the agn ) is simply e_&~ & 4r^2 a_cl t + & ~ & 10 ^ 57 l_12 r_100 ^ -2 f_abs(m_c10 ^ 5)^2/3 n_4 ^ -2/3 ( t10 ^ 7 ) where @xmath102 is the projected area of the cloud .",
    "thus the ratio of agn energy input to cloud binding energy is ~10 ^ 6 l_12 r_100 ^ -2 f_abs(m_c10 ^ 5)^-1 n_4 ^ -1(t10 ^ 7 ) which is several orders of magnitude larger than the energy input calculated above for a starburst .",
    "( since the bolometric luminosities are the same in both cases , the same amount of radiation  mostly re - radiated in the far - ir  must of course be incident on a typical cloud in a starburst - powered ulirg . precisely because this radiation is dominantly at infrared wavelengths , however , it will have far less impact on the ism in a ulirg than the radiation from an agn , serving mostly to increase the typical ism temperatures . )",
    "evaporation and ablation of clouds which are exposed to the agn can be very significant , leading to destruction of the molecular ism ( begelman 1985 ) .",
    "because of the large gas column densities inferred in the nuclei of ulirgs , however , it is likely that most of the ism does not have an unobscured view of the agn .",
    "here the fact that the spectrum of an agn extends to high energies ( @xmath103 kev ) is of great importance , as these photons can penetrate large column densities before being absorbed .",
    "this means that the amount of energy deposited by x - rays can be very large even if there is a significant column between a cloud and the radiation source : the energy deposition rate per unit volume is approximately nh_x~310 ^ -17(f_x0.1)l_12 r_100 ^ -2(10 ^ 22)^-1 n_4(maloney , hollenbach , & tielens 1996 , hereafter mht ) , where @xmath104 is the fraction of the bolometric luminosity emitted in the @xmath105 kev energy band , and  is the column density of neutral hydrogen between the cloud and the agn",
    ". for shielding columns @xmath106 , only hard x - ray ( @xmath107 kev ) photons will be present .",
    "unlike the case of the photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) powered by stellar uv photons , where dust absorption leads to exponential attenuation of the heating and ionization rates with depth , the xdrs powered by agn are characterized by an only linear decrease of the energy input with increasing column density ( the exact scaling with column density depends weakly on the spectral index of the incident radiation field : mht ) .",
    "the total energy input to the cloud is then ~10 ^ 55(f_x0.1)l_12 r_100 ^ -2n_22 ^ -1(m_c10 ^ 5 ) ( t10 ^ 7 ) where the shielding column has been scaled to @xmath108 .",

    "most of this energy is simply radiated away ( although photoevaporation will occur if the clouds are heated enough to raise the sound speed above the escape speed ) .",

    "the temperatures are considerably higher than the typical ism in the milky way ; note also that the thermal balance has been calculated including only the heating due to x - rays . clearly , high gas densities are mandatory for molecular survival in agn - powered ulirgs , even when the agn is buried beneath a large column density of gas and dust .",
    "in the post-_iso _ era , surely no one needs to be reminded of the wealth of information provided by far - infrared fine - structure line observations , a point that was made repeatedly throughout this meeting . as discussed by mht , xdrs are copious sources of emission in these lines .    figure 2 shows the emergent surface brightnesses in a number of important mid- and far - infrared lines , for the same xdr model parameters as used for figure 1 .",
    "also plotted is the total far - infrared continuum surface brightness from grain emission .",
    "of particular note are : ( 1 ) the extremely high line surface brightnesses which can be produced ; ( 2 ) major cooling lines such as [ o@xmath171i ] 63@xmath82 m and [ si@xmath171ii ] 35@xmath82 m are bright over nearly the entire parameter space ; and ( 3 ) compared with the far - ir continuum produced in the xdr , the surface brightnesses in these same lines can be extraordinarily high , with line - to - continuum ratios approaching @xmath172 .",
    "in contrast , the line - to - continuum ratios produced in pdrs are usually of order @xmath173 , and rarely exceed @xmath174 ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) .",
    "this difference is a reflection of the fact that in pdrs the gas heating is limited by the grain photoelectric heating efficiency ; in contrast , in xdrs about as much energy is deposited into the gas as into the grains , so that major cooling transitions can carry a large fraction of the total deposited energy ( see mht for details ) .",
    "the other important point to note is that all of these lines arise from neutral or singly - ionized species ; because of the large column densities which x - ray photons can traverse , the volume of the xdr can be vastly larger than the volume of any high - ionization region produced by the agn .",
    "a number of other infrared transitions are of particular interest for ulirgs .",
    "the near - infrared vibration - rotation lines of molecular hydrogen have been detected from a number of ulirgs ( most spectacularly in the not - quite - an - ulirg ngc 6240 ) ; the @xmath175 m fine - structure line of [ fe@xmath176ii ] is frequently detected as well .",
    "observations with _",
    "iso _ have produced detections of the [ ne@xmath176ii ] @xmath177 m line in a number of ulirgs as well , and the first extragalactic detections of the pure rotational transitions of h@xmath178 , including observations of the archetypical ulirg arp 220 ( sturm _ et al .",

    "i have plotted the emergent surface brightnesses for the @xmath179 and @xmath180 s(1 ) lines of molecular hydrogen , the @xmath175 m [ fe@xmath176ii ] line , br@xmath181 , and the [ ne@xmath176ii ] @xmath177 m line . as in figure 2",
    ", the high line surface brightnesses are striking .",
    "the extent of the [ fe@xmath171ii ] emission is limited by gas temperature , since the upper state lies @xmath182 k above the ground state .",
    "the drop - off in molecular hydrogen emission at @xmath183 is also due to declining @xmath143 ( the @xmath184 and @xmath185 levels lie approximately 6000 and 12,000 k above ground , respectively ) ; the secondary rise is due to direct nonthermal excitations of the levels . for a fixed density , the [ fe@xmath176ii ]",
    "emission always lies interior to the molecular hydrogen emission ( see also maloney 1997 ) .",
    "the run of density with @xmath186 ( or radius ) will determine the ratios of the h@xmath178 and [ fe@xmath176ii ] lines with respect to each other and to br@xmath181 .",
    "an additional interesting result is the intensity of the [ ne@xmath176ii ] @xmath177 m line .",
    "this is the single most important coolant over a substantial fraction of the plotted parameter space ; as much as @xmath187 of the deposited x - ray energy emerges in this line alone .",
    "the resulting surface brightnesses are extraordinarily high , and the total line luminosity can be a substantial fraction of the total hard x - ray luminosity",
    ".    the pure rotation lines of molecular hydrogen are of particular interest because they are much less subject to extinction than the near - infrared lines , and because they provide a tracer of warm ( few hundred k ) molecular gas , unlike the vibration - rotation bands which require @xmath188 k for effective excitation .",

    "_ 1997 ) and the s(1 ) and s(5 ) lines ( at 17 and @xmath189 m , respectively ) have been detected in arp 220 ( sturm _ et al .  _ 1996 ) .    in figure 4",
    "i have plotted the surface brightnesses of the s(0 ) , s(1 ) , s(3 ) , and s(5 ) lines for the xdr model of figure 1 .",
    "current observations lack the spatial resolution to do more than measure the total line luminosities .",
    "however , even this should prove extremely useful for constraining models of the ism in ulirgs , and xdr models in particular ( lutz _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .      in ulirgs ,",
    "the ratio of the hcn  line to that of co is typically @xmath190 ( solomon , downes , & radford 1992 ) , an order of magnitude larger than the value typically observed in normal spirals . in the nuclear ( @xmath191 pc ) region of ngc 1068 , this ratio reaches unity ( tacconi _ et al .",
    "such high values have been interpreted as meaning that the density is high ( @xmath192 ) , so that both the hcn and co lines are approximately thermalized , and that both of the transitions are optically thick , or nearly so .",
    "however , the inferred high densities must be regarded with some caution , as the hcn rotational transitions can be pumped through a bending mode via absorption at @xmath193 m ; this process is plausibly important in both starbursts and agn ( aalto _ et al .  _",
    "1995 ; barvainis _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "the line center optical depth for a transition at frequency @xmath194 is _ o = c^38 ^ 3a_jig_jg_in_iv ( 1-e^-h / kt_ex ) where @xmath195 is the einstein @xmath196coefficient , @xmath197 and @xmath134 denote the upper and lower states , the @xmath198s are the statistical weights , @xmath199 is the column density in the lower state , @xmath200 is the linewidth , and @xmath201 is the excitation temperature characterizing the relative populations of levels @xmath134 and @xmath197 . assuming equal excitation temperatures for the two transitions and that @xmath202 , the ratio of @xmath203 columns for the  transitions is then = ||^2||^2 1.810 ^ -3 .",
    "this ratio is much less than unity because the @xmath196coefficient for the hcn transition is so much larger than for the corresponding transition of co , in consequence of its much larger dipole moment @xmath82 .",
    "thus , if the hcn abundance is more than a fraction of a percent of the co abundance , the hcn  transition will be optically thick if the co transition is .",
    "of course , if the co  optical depth is very large , then a much smaller hcn abundance will still lead to an optically thick hcn line .",
    "furthermore , it is very important to note that equation ( 47 ) gives the ratio of required column densities in @xmath204 .",
    "because of its much lower critical density , it is likely that the partition function for co will be close to the lte limit for the relevant conditions , while that of hcn will not , so that the co molecules will be distributed over a much larger number of rotational states .",
    "hence the ratio @xmath205 will be much larger for hcn than for co , also reducing the required hcn abundance .    in the quiescent interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "the optical thickness condition is not fulfilled , as the hcn abundance is usually @xmath206 .",
    "furthermore , there are indications that in very active galactic nuclei ( either high sfr or agn ) , the optical depths in the co lines are only modest ( aalto _ et al .  _ 1995 ;",
    "barvainis _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , so that the hcn lines are not optically thick in reflection of very optically thick co lines .",
    "however , the increased ionization rate in an xdr can lead to an enhanced abundance of hcn relative to co ( lepp & dalgarno 1996 ) . in figure 5",
    "i show the abundances of co , hcn , and the ratio @xmath207 as a function of @xmath1  and distance .",
    "the agn parameters are the same as previously , but i have increased the density to @xmath208  simply to make the gas dominantly molecular within 100 pc of the nucleus . the hcn / co ratio is greater than @xmath209 over about a factor of three in radius .",
    "thus in an xdr the hcn abundance can be elevated sufficiently relative to co to explain the observed line ratios .",
    "( in hot star - forming cores , the hcn / co ratio also reaches values of order @xmath209 [ blake _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ] , so elevated values may be expected in starburst - powered ulirgs as well . )",
    "the mid - ir emission features attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) have been used to discriminate between agn and starbursts in ulirgs ( lutz _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , based on the observation that these features are weak or absent in classical agn but generally strong in starbursts .",
    "does the presence of pah features imply the absence of an agn ?",
    "voit ( 1992 ) has investigated the effects of x - ray irradiation on pahs .",
    "absorption of an energetic photon leads to destruction of the pah , through two processes : ( 1 ) photo - thermal dissociation ( evaporation ) , and ( 2 ) coulomb `` explosion '' , in which the pah is doubly ionized by the incident photon and subsequently fragments as the repulsive coulomb force effectively reduces the binding energy of the pah . to estimate the magnitude of the destruction timescale ,",
    "assume that every absorption of an x - ray photon by a pah leads to its destruction : _",
    "xd~2 ( f_x0.1 ) l_12 r_100 ^",
    "-2 n_22 ^ 1.6 assuming a flat ( @xmath210 ) spectrum .",
    "even if @xmath166 , the pah x - ray destruction time is only @xmath211 years at 100 pc .    to determine whether pahs can survive in the face of such short destruction timescales",
    ", we need to compare @xmath212 with the rate at which the pahs re - accrete material ( this is dominated by accretion of c@xmath213 if the pahs are neutral ) . since a photo - destruction rate is balanced against a density - dependent reaction rate , this again leads to a critical ionization parameter at which @xmath214 , which , using the results of voit ( 1992 ) , is u_cr~510 ^ -9 ( y0.3 ) n_50 ^ 1/2 f_pah^o1 ( ) where @xmath215 is an effective sticking coefficient for accretion , the number of carbon atoms in the pah is @xmath216 , and 0  is the fraction of pahs which are neutral .",
    "@xmath217 is a dimensionless , spectrum - weighted cross section for photodissociation of carbon from a pah , ( the photon flux - weighted photodissociation cross - section , normalized to the pah geometric cross - section ) , approximately given by @xmath218 ( see figure 3 in voit 1992 ) .",
    "this gives the critical ionization parameter for pah survival as u_cr~1.310 ^ -4(y0.3 ) n_50 ^ 1/2 f_pah^o",
    "f_c^+ n_22 where @xmath219 . from this expression",
    ", we find that pahs will survive against x - ray destruction at a radius ( with @xmath220 ) r_cr~100 ^1/2 ( 10 ^ 7)^-1/2 n_22 ^ -1/2 .",
    "note the importance of large ( @xmath221 ) shielding columns and high pressures for the survival of pahs .",
    "since , as we have seen , both large column densities and high pressures are characteristic of the ism in ulirgs , it is quite probable that pahs will in general resist destruction by x - ray irradiation even in agn - powered ulirgs , and so the presence of pah features should not be taken as conclusive proof of the absence of an agn .",
