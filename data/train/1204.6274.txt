    "the grand unified theories ( guts ) , which embed the standard model ( sm ) gauge group into a large single gauge group , are quite attractive , and so a variety of models of the theories are proposed since the earliest work based on the su(5 ) symmetry group was presented by georgi and glashow in 1974 @xcite . among them , the supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy guts ) are considered to be promising candidates since they realize the gauge coupling unification with great accuracy @xcite as well as solving the hierarchy problem in the guts @xcite . the supersymmetric version of the georgi - glashow su(5 ) gut , which is the simplest among the susy guts , is called the minimal susy su(5 ) gut @xcite .",
    "one of the most distinctive features which guts predict is the existence of baryon - number violating interactions , such as proton decay . in the susy guts with @xmath6 parity , for example ,",
    "proton decay is induced by two different processes : the colored - higgs and the @xmath7-boson exchanging processes .",
    "the colored higgs triplets are introduced for the higgs doublets in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to be incorporated into the su(5 ) multiplets",
    ". the colored - higgs exchange yields baryon - number violating dimension - five operators , which give rise to the dominant contribution to proton decay in the minimal susy su(5 ) guts @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath7 bosons are the gauge bosons in the unified su(5 ) gauge group , and they induce proton decay through the dimension - six operators . since there has been no experimental signal of proton decay so far , strong limits are imposed on these interactions , especially on the former one .",
    "super - kamiokande gives the bounds on the proton lifetime : @xmath8  yrs with 219.7 kt - yr of data @xcite and @xmath9  yrs with 172.8 kt - yr of data at 90% confidence level @xcite .",
    "these bounds are so stringent that the minimal su(5 ) susy gut is excluded since the colored - higgs - boson exchange process yields too short lifetime in the @xmath10 channel @xcite .",
    "this prediction is , however , quite model - dependent .",
    "in fact , many models are proposed in order to allow them to evade the experimental constraints .",
    "such attempts @xcite are accomplished by pushing the mass of the colored higgs much heavier than the gut scale and/or suppressing the dimension - five operators by a certain symmetry , _",
    "e.g. _ , the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xcite in the four - dimensional guts . in the extra - dimensional models , the @xmath6 symmetry is introduced to suppress the dimension - five proton decay @xcite . with the extensions ,",
    "the @xmath7-boson exchanging interactions become dominant and the proton lifetime turns out to be long enough to avoid the current limit . in this work , we assume such mechanism works and concentrate on the proton decay via the @xmath7-boson exchange .    nowadays , the weak - scale supersymmetry itself is severely constrained by the experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "since there has been no signal of susy particles , the atlas and the cms collaborations give severe limits on their masses , especially those of colored particles @xcite .",
    "moreover , the collaborations have recently announced that they detected signatures of higgs boson for the first time @xcite . according to their results , the mass of higgs boson is about 125 gev . the result is welcome to the mssm , which predicts the light higgs boson , while the substantial radiative corrections are required in order to raise the mass of higgs boson up to 125 gev .",
    "since the corrections are increased as the susy particles become heavy , this situation implies that the susy scale might be higher than the electroweak scale @xcite , and challenges natural solutions to the hierarchy problem .",
    "these results give constraints on models of the susy - breaking mediation .",
    "the low - energy gauge mediation model may be required to introduce several messenger multiplets so that the susy particles are heavy enough @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there have been several alternatives to explain the 125 gev higgs boson in an extension of the mssm .",
    "introducing vector - like supermultiplets to the mssm is one of the simplest way to accomplish the purpose @xcite . in this case , the quantum effects by the extra multiplets help to increase the higgs - boson mass . with the multiplets being a representation of the grand unified group ,",
    "the perturbative gauge coupling unification is still preserved with great accuracy .",
    "the mssm with vector - like multiplets and high - scale susy models modifies the proton decay rates . in this work ,",
    "we examine it in detail .",
    "we will find that vector - like matters enhance the proton decay rate , while heavy sfermions extend its lifetime .",
    "this investigation indicates that the proton - decay experiments might provide a hint for the low - energy structure of the susy guts .",
    "we assume that the susy guts are realized in the four - dimensional spacetime , and not consider the extra - dimensional susy guts in which the gauge symmetry is broken by the boundary conditions . in the latter models , the main decay modes of proton depend on configuration of quarks and leptons in the extra - dimensional space @xcite",
    ". however , the decrease / enhancement of the proton lifetime we show are almost universal even in those models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by reviewing the susy su(5 ) guts in sec .",
    "[ msgut ] , and discuss the proton decay via the @xmath7-boson exchange in the subsequent section .",

    "first , we write down the two - loop renormalization group equations for the strong coupling constant below the electroweak scale : @xmath153 with @xmath154 the strong coupling constant and @xmath155 where @xmath156 denotes the number of quark flavors in an effective theory .    the long - distance factor , @xmath97 , is determined by the ratio of the coefficients for the effective operators at the scale of @xmath157 and 2  gev : @xmath158 with the coefficient @xmath159 satisfying the following rge at two - loop level  @xcite : @xmath160c(\\mu)~.\\ ] ] the solution of the equation is @xmath161^{-\\frac{2}{b_1 } } \\biggl [ \\frac{4\\pi b_1+b_2\\alpha_s(\\mu ) } { 4\\pi b_1+b_2\\alpha_s(\\mu_0 ) } \\biggr]^{\\bigl(\\frac{2}{b_1}-\\frac{6 + 2n_f}{9 b_2}\\bigr)}~,\\ ] ] with @xmath162 and @xmath163 given in eq .",
