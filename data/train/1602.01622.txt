    "the study of plasma instabilities is of major importance in a wide range of areas as e.g. astrophysics , cosmology , tokamaks , lasers , etc . in the non - relativistic regime , there is a well established hydrodynamic formalism , magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , that consists of the navier - stokes equation for the momentum , the continuity equation for the mass density and the maxwell equations for the electromagnetic fields , complemented with a corresponding ohm s law .",
    "this theory is known as a first order theory , as it is the result of a first order expansion in gradients of the distribution function around equilibrium . when turning to relativistic domains , it is possible to extend to it the tools employed to study ideal fluids , i.e. the euler equation .",
    "but when dissipative processes are taken into account , the natural generalization of navier - stokes equation to relativistic velocities proved to fail , as the solutions are all unstable and non - causal @xcite . among the relativistic first order theories ,",
    "the eckart @xcite and landau - lifshitz @xcite formulations are the best known .    since the seventies",
    "several theories were proposed to overcome these drawbacks , among them the so - called second order theories ( among several possible strategies @xcite ) , as e.g. the ones developed by israel and stewart @xcite .",
    "both formalisms , first and second order , are based on a gradient expansion of the 1pdf around equilibrium , and in this sense their applicability is limited to small deviations from local equilibrium .",
    "there is another set of theories , not anchored to a kinetic equation , and that are not the result of a perturbative expansion , they are known as divergence type theories ( dtt ) and were developed by liu and others @xcite .",
    "they are exact and thus can describe systems well away from equilibrium , but their drawback is that they are not clearly linked to microscopic physics .",
    "a paradigmatic case of relativistic plasma is the nuclear matter created in the experiments ongoing at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "there are clear experimental signatures that the relativistic matter created in the collisions , a quark - gluon plasma , behaves as a strongly coupled system .",
    "consequently rhic s plasmas offer a unique scenario to test relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "indeed pure hydrodynamic models proved to be very successful in describing the main features of these plasmas , thus strongly improving the understanding of those systems . for a comprehensive review on relativistic hydrodynamics and rhic s plasmas",
    "citesch14,jehe15,rom16 and references therein .",
    "rhic s plasmas show two special features : high degree of anisotropy and quick thermalization .",
    "in fact , the longitudinal expansion of the fireball causes the system to be much colder in the longitudinal direction than in the transverse ones .",
    "such an out of equilibrium state favors the presence of instabilities and can not be studied with the usual hydrodynamic models based on perturbative schemes around equilibrium configurations .",
    "although the development of an anisotropic hydrodynamics @xcite is a very important step toward the understanding of those systems , it is not clear if the resulting hydrodynamics retains enough features of the underlying kinetic regime to provide a satisfactory description of instabilities .",
    "concerning hydrodinamization , it is believed that the instabilities favored by the anisotropic background contribute to such a process .",
    "indeed , mrwczyzky showed that they play a substantial rle in the dynamics of the early stages of the evolution of quark - gluon plasmas . for more details on this issue , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "there are experimental evidences of the presence of magnetic fields in the rhic s plasmas @xcite .",
    "most of the above mentioned anisotropic hydrodynamic models do not take into account electromagnetic fields and consequently are not suitable to give a realistic explanation of the observations .    the main purpose of our study is to start building a consistent magnetohydrodynamic theory to describe strongly coupled , high energy plasmas , without having to address to kinetic theory for each different system under study , and that includes both the background and its perturbations in a consistent way .    to facilitate the calculations we consider a massless abelian plasma .",
    "although a non - abelian theory is needed to correctly describe the plasmas created at rhics , our choice has the advantage of simplifying the mathematics without depriving the model of physical relevance @xcite .    to give our model a kinetic theory support , we write the different tensors as momenta of a distribution function and to obtain their evolution equations we invoke a mean field kinetic model described by the boltzmann - vlasov equation . as for the collision integral , most of the literature uses the bgk ( bhatnagar , gross and krook ) relaxation time model , as it allows to effectively handle distributions other than the maxwell - boltzmann .",
    "its relativistic generalization was developed by marle and is of the form @xmath0 @xcite . in the classical limit",
    ", marle s formulation gives the same result for the transport coefficients as the classical bgk model .",
    "however , in the extreme relativistic limit the results for the transport coefficients with marle s formulation differ functionally from the ones calculated with the relativistic grad moment method .",
    "anderson and witting @xcite proposed an improvement of marle s collision integral of the form @xmath1 with @xmath2 the four velocity of the gas . in the classical limit this expression gives the same classical results as marle s , since in that limit @xmath3 , and in the extreme relativistic limit it produces the same transport coefficients that are obtained via the relativistic grad moment method .",
    "consequently , as we are dealing with a highly relativistic system we shall adopt the anderson - witting prescription instead of the bgk collision kernel in marle s form , generally adopted in the literature .",
    "we consider a model where the distribution function is the product of an equilibrium expression times a non - equilibrium part .",
    "the former is isotropic and homogeneous in the momenta , and also depends on a thermal potential that accounts for possible excess of particles over antiparticles .",
    "we specify it by demanding that the ideal energy - momentum tensor @xmath4 calculated from it , corresponds to the landau - lifshitz prescription , whereby in the rest frame @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the latter contains all the information about anisotropies and dissipation .",
    "for the collision integral , we only demand it to be linear in the tensors that describe non - equilibrium features , i.e. , ohmic and viscous dissipation , and possible anisotropies in the momenta distribution . the main motivation behind this choice is to avoid mathematical complexity .",
    "our model is not truly reliable for arbitrarily large anisotropy , as it will be discussed below ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . within its range of validity",
    ", however , it fully captures nonlinearities coming from the convective derivative terms and from direct coupling of the hydrodynamic variables to the electromagnetic fields in the equations of motion .",
    "these are the only nonlinearities in the usual magnetohydrodynamics , where dissipative terms are assumed to be linear . for this reason",
    ", we believe the hydrodynamic equations to be introduced below ( eqs .",
    "( [ b33 ] ) to ( [ b43b ] ) ) are a valid generalization of mhd to the relativistic regime .",
    "moreover , we also believe any consistent relativistic dynamics of real fluids will converge to this formalism within its range of validity .",
    "we build our formalism by writing the different tensors as moments of the distribution function , and find their evolution equations by taking the corresponding moments of the vlasov - boltzmann equation . by projecting those equations along the four velocity and onto its orthogonal hypersurface",
    "we obtain five hydrodynamic equations : for the charge density , for the energy density , for the velocity field and for the two tensors that describe dissipation . together with maxwell equations they form our magnetohydrodynamic model .    as an application of our formalism we study the transverse instabilities that appear in fluctuations around an anisotropic background .",
    "these were first discussed by e. s. weibel @xcite in a non - relativistic setting , and then in the relativistic regime in refs .",
    "@xcite among others . in the non - relativistic theory",
    "a purely macroscopic approach already exists , see e.g. refs .",
    "our aim is to generalize these macroscopic approaches to relativistic theories , accounting for dissipative effects .",
    "of course the weibel instability is not the only possible instability of relativistic plasmas , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed analysis of the different kinds of instabilities in abelian plasmas .",
    "moreover when considering non - abelian plasmas new kinds of instabilities appear , as can be seen in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to avoid a heavy mathematical content ,",
    "we leave for forthcoming manuscripts the analysis of the other instabilities in abelian plasmas , as well as the extension of our formalism to the non - abelian case .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows , in section [ kt ] we build the 1pdf . in section [ bh ]",
    "we build the magnetohydrodynamic formalism , by deducing the tensors and the equations they must satisfy . in section [ pt ] we linearize the previously found equations around a background with anisotropic pressure , and find the dispersion relation for the normal modes , consistent with the limitations of the model . for a wide range of values of the parameter space , our model predicts the excitation of instabilities , whose features are in agreement with results previously found in the literature .",
    "to illustrate those the dependence on the different parameters of the model , we plot this relation for several values of them .",
    "finally , in section [ cl ] we summarize our conclusions and comment on future perspectives .",
    "we work with natural units , i.e. , @xmath6 and with signature @xmath7 .",
    "in this section we shortly review some basics of kinetic theory of plasmas and build the 1pdf of our model . in the mean field approach the kinetic equation for a plasma with electromagnetic fields is the boltzmann - vlasov equation , which reads @xmath8f\\left(x^{\\mu},p^{\\mu}\\right)= i_{col}\\left(x^{\\mu},p^{\\mu}\\right)\\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the distribution function , @xmath10 the collision integral ( to be defined below ) .",
