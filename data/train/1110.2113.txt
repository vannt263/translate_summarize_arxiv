    "most of the states recently observed at the @xmath11 factories and the tevatron , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 states , do not fit the quarkonia interpretation .",

    "particularly interesting are the @xmath14 states , observed in @xmath15 annihilation .",

    "belle found that the @xmath17 enhancement observed by babar was , in fact , produced by two distinct peaks the @xmath18 and the @xmath8 . in the bottom sector , the belle s observation of an anomalously large @xmath19 production around the @xmath20 lead to the proposal of the existence of a new resonance .",

    "there are many other interpretations for this state : tetraquark state @xcite , hadronic molecule of @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 @xcite , a hybrid charmonium @xcite , a charm baryonium @xcite , a cusp @xcite , etc . within the available experimental information",
    ", none of these suggestions can be completely ruled out .",
    "for the @xmath10 it has been interpreted as a tetraquark state , in a @xmath28-wave scalar - diquark scalar - antidiquark configuration @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the anomalously large @xmath29 production observed by the belle collaboration does not come from a new resonance but via sub - process @xmath30 @xcite .    in this work we use the qcd sum rule approach ( qcdsr )",

    "we also study if a similar @xmath31 current , and a tetraquark current ( in a scalar - vector diquark configuration ) could describe the @xmath10 state .",
    "the qcdsr approach is based on the two - point correlation function _ ( q)=id^4x  e^iq.x0| t [ j_(x)j_^(0 ) ] |0 , where the current @xmath32 contains all the information about the hadron of interest , like quantum numbers , quarks contents and so on .",

    "we work at leading order in @xmath5 in the operators , we consider the contributions from condensates up to dimension six and we keep terms which are linear in the strange quark mass @xmath6 . in the phenomenological side , the correlation function is calculated by inserting intermediate states for the hadronic state , h , and parametrizing the coupling of these states to the current @xmath32 , in terms of a generic coupling parameter @xmath36 , so that : 0 | j_| y = _ , where @xmath37 is the polarization vector .    the phenomenological side of eq .",

    "<S> using the qcd sum rules we test if the charmonium - like structure @xmath0 , observed in the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum , can be described as a exotic state , with a @xmath2 molecular current with @xmath3 . by exotic we mean a more complex structure than the simple quark - antiquark state and not exotic @xmath4 quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension six and we work at leading order in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we keep terms which are linear in the strange quark mass @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass obtained for such state is @xmath7 gev , when the vector and scalar mesons are in color singlet configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the proposed current can better describe the @xmath8 state that could be interpreted as a @xmath9 molecular state . </S>",
    "<S> we also use different @xmath3 currents to study the recently observed @xmath10 state . </S>",
    "<S> our findings indicate that the @xmath10 can be well described by a scalar - vector tetraquark current . </S>"
