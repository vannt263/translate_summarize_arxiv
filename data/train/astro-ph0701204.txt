    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on board the swift satellite has for the first time allowed a follow - up of the x - ray afterglows of grbs starting within one minute of the bat trigger ( burrows et al .",
    "these early afterglow observations have revealed several surprising features which can not be easily understood in terms of the usual interpretation where the afterglow comes from dissipation in a forward shock propagating through the source environment . at very early times immediately after the burst prompt emission , the afterglow first exhibits a steep decrease of temporal slope @xmath3 - 5 ( @xmath4 ) ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "it is often followed by a much shallower part with @xmath5 which can last for several hours until a more standard slope @xmath6 is finally observed ( nousek et al .",
    "moreover flares with sharp rise and decay times are often present , superimposed on the power - law evolution ( burrows et al .",
    "2005b ) . in most cases ,",
    "the spectrum remains essentially constant through the breaks which may indicate that a single physical process is responsible for the whole x - ray emission .",
    "the forward shock could be such a process but it seems unable , at least in its simplest version , to account for the early slopes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it has been suggested that the shallow part of the light curve could still be produced by the forward shock if it is continuously feeded in energy by the central source ( panaitescu et al .",
    "2005 ; zhang et al .",
    "another possibility would be to delay the rise of the forward shock contribution as a result of viewing angle effects ( eichler and granot , 2005 ) .",
    "these two proposals would however strengthen the constraint on the efficiency of the prompt gamma - ray emission which is already a potential problem for the internal shock scenario ( see however fan & piran , 2006 and zhang et al .",
    "for the initial steep decay , curvature effects of the emitting shell have been invoked ( nousek et al . 2005 ) while flares are usually explained by a late activity of the central source ( zhang et al .",
    "2005 ; fan & wei , 2005 ) .    in this paper we do not consider the origin of flares but",
    "rather focus on the evolution of the early x - ray afterglow .",
    "we propose that it could be accounted for by a contribution from the reverse shock .",
    "we develop a simple model which allows us to follow the internal , reverse and forward shocks in a consistent way .",
    "we compute the energy dissipated in the reverse shock and show that , for some specific initial distribution of the lorentz factor in the flow , it is possible to reproduce the succession of the three slopes @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we then discuss under which conditions part of this dissipated energy can be radiated in the x - ray range , providing an alternative explanation for the early x - ray afterglows of grbs .",
    "we also obtain the optical emission of the reverse shock and show that chromatic breaks can be observed in some cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect.2 we present the simplified model we use to follow the dynamics of internal shocks .",
    "we explain in sect.3 how it is extended to include the interaction with the environment and we compute the power dissipated in the reverse shock .",
    "we consider in sect.4 the possibility for this power to be partially radiated in the x - ray range .",
    "we discuss in sect.5 the relative importance of the reverse and forward shock contributions and present x - ray and optical afterglow light curves produced by the reverse shock alone .",
    "sect.6 is our conclusion .",
    "in the context of the internal shock model for the prompt emission of grbs the pulses observed in the light curve are produced when fast moving material catches up with slower one previously ejected by the central source ( rees & meszaros , 1994 ) .",
    "this process has often been represented by the collision of two `` shells '' of negligible thickness .",
    "however the central source probably does not release individual shells but a continuous relativistic outflow with a varying lorentz factor .",
    "for this reason the shape of the pulses is largely dominated by hydrodynamical effects ( daigne & mochkovitch , 2003 ) while high latitude emission ( curvature effect ) only becomes important at late times .",
    "soderberg and fenimore ( 2001 ) have for example found that the decay of pulses differs from what would be expected if it was controlled by the curvature effect alone .",
    "a hydrodynamical study of the relativistic flow emerging from the central engine therefore appears necessary for a detailed description of the physics of pulses but it is naturally quite expensive in computing time ( daigne & mochkovitch , 2000 ) .",
    "fortunately it can often be replaced by a simplified model where the flow is represented by a large number of regularly ejected shells which interact by direct collision only ( daigne & mochkovitch , 1998 ) .",
    "this neglects pressure waves but this is a good approximation since kinetic energy strongly dominates over internal energy of the flow .",
    "this approach implies to use many shells ( from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) to represent accurately the distribution of mass and lorentz factor .",
    "it is different from the even more simplified description where the numbers of shells essentially corresponds to the number of pulses to be produced and where the temporal profiles are then entirely fixed by the curvature effect ( kobayashi , piran & sari , 1997 ) . + the position @xmath12 of each shell of mass @xmath13 and lorentz factor @xmath14 is followed as a function of time @xmath15 ( in the source frame ) .",
    "when shell @xmath16 catches up with shell @xmath17 a shock occurs at time @xmath18 and radius @xmath19 .",
    "the two shells merge and the resulting lorentz factor after the collision is given by @xmath20 if the the released energy @xmath21 can be efficiently radiated it will be received by the observer at a time @xmath22 and for a typical duration @xmath23 under the condition that the radiative time is much smaller than the dynamical time ( fast cooling regime ) .",
    "the burst bolometric luminosity can then be obtained from the sum of all the elementary shock contributions , the dynamical evolution being terminated when all the shells have their lorentz factor decreasing downstream so that no new internal shock can form . for an accurate description of the pulse profile at late times , the contribution @xmath24 of each elementary shock must include the curvature effect of the emitting shell which yields @xmath25 for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the opening angle of the jet here supposed to be seen on axis ( granot , piran & sari , 1999 ; woods & loeb , 1999 ) .",
    "the luminosity in a given energy band depends on some additional ( and uncertain ) assumptions on the post - shock magnetic field and lorentz factor of the electrons which are discussed in sect . 4 and 5 while in sect .",
    "3 we restrict ourselves to the bolometric emission only .    to produce a single pulse burst ( or a pulse as a building block of a more complex burst ) we have often used in previous works ( daigne & mochkovitch , 1998 , 2000 ) an initial distribution of the lorentz factor of the form @xmath28 if @xmath29 and @xmath30 if @xmath31 ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the maximum and minimum values of the lorentz factor and @xmath34 the duration of the relativistic wind emission ( the first shell is then ejected at @xmath35 and the last one at @xmath36 ) .",
    "this lorentz factor distribution where a rapid part of the flow is decelerated by a slower part placed ahead of it , has been represented in fig.1a for @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 s. the resulting bolometric profile from dissipation by internal shocks is shown in fig.1b for a total ( isotropic ) radiated energy @xmath40 erg .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have developed a simplified model which enabled us to follow simultaneously the dynamics of the internal , external and reverse shocks in grbs .",
    "we were mainly interested by dissipation in the reverse shock when the lorentz factor in the material which is ejected at late times by the source decreases to small values , @xmath41 .",
    "the propagation of the reverse shock then extends over quite a long time needed to decelerate the fast moving part of the ejecta down to @xmath42 .",
    "we have obtained the dissipated power as a function of observed time for different burst environments ( wind or constant density ) .",
    "its evolution shows a striking resemblance with the early afterglow light curves observed by swift , especially in the wind case .",
    "however the reverse shock contribution is normally expected at low energy and to appear in x - rays it requires a transfer of the dissipated power to only a small fraction ( @xmath43 ) of the electron population .",
    "if this is possible , swift xrt observations could be better explained by the reverse shock than by the standard afterglow produced by the forward shock .",
    "we have also computed the optical emission from the reverse shock .",
    "the comparison with the x - ray light curve often reveals the presence of chromatic breaks during the first hours .",
    "such breaks have been observed and are difficult to explain with the standard model where the afterglow comes from the forward shock .",
    "we have finally even proposed that in some cases the entire afterglow could be produced by the reverse shock .",
    "we fully understand that , to be validated , this non standard view still has to show that it can successfully explain multiwavelength observations of a reasonable sample of grb afterglows .",
    "we aim to perform these necessary tests in a work in preparation .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    using eq.(37 ) for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 we give the expressions for the flux at a given frequency in the fast and slow cooling regimes : 0.3cm_fast cooling_0.2cm1 ) @xmath47 @xmath48 2 ) @xmath49 @xmath50 3 ) @xmath51 @xmath52 0.3cm_slow",
