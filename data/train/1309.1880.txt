    "ferroelectric perovskites or perovskite solid solution near a ferroelectric instability have potential applications as fast capacitive storage medium @xcite and considerable interest exists to develop lead - free ferroelectric materials to replace the widely used piezoelectric pb(zr , ti)o@xmath0 ( pzt ) .",
    "@xcite systematic selection and improvement of materials and properties for applications depends on the detailed knowledge of the physics in these materials , which frequently requires understanding of phenomena over medium and long length and time scales .",
    "atomistic model simulations of ferroelectric perovskites , such as isotropic @xcite and anisotropic @xcite shell models and approaches based on effective hamiltonians @xcite , can probe length and time scales that are beyond the reach of computationally much more demanding first - principles simulations . in order to observe finite temperature phase transitions , broad stoichiometric",
    "ordering of solid solutions , and nano - scale properties within a bulk material or thin films ( e.g. grain boundaries , domain walls ) , simulation cells must contain thousands of atoms .",
    "both the shell model and the effective hamiltonian have free parameters that are fitted from experimental and first - principles observations .",
    "fitting an isotropic shell model to first principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations is generally easier than an effective model hamiltonian , which is much more complex .",
    "in addition a shell model retains information on atomic positions .",
    "the accuracy of a shell model depends on both the complexity of the model and on the accuracy of the data used to fit the model , which for dft depends on approximations made in the exchange - correlation functional .",

    "@xcite a shell model of batio@xmath0 , fitted to dft using the local density approximation ( lda ) , significantly underestimates the lattice constants , polarizations , and phase transition temperatures of batio@xmath0.@xcite .",
    "scaling of the lattice constant to the experimental values does not correct issues with the magnitude of polarization and phase transition temperatures,@xcite and introduces inconsistencies across different supercell sizes . the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) within dft as implemented by perdew , burke , and ernzerhoff ( pbe ) @xcite",
    "improves the accuracy of the lattice constants of all phases and energy differences between phases , but it severely overestimates the tetragonal strain and volume of each unit cell.@xcite the failure of the mentioned approximations is due to the sensitivity of perovskite ferroelectric properties to pressure . increasing the pressure significantly decreases the well depths in the potential energy surface @xcite .    to improve on the issues with lda and gga / pbe in dft calculations of perovskites ,",
    "two other forms for the exchange - correlation functional have been considered : the weighted density approximation ( wda ) @xcite and the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation for solids ( pbesol).@xcite wda gives much better cubic lattice constants for batio@xmath0 , but it does not improve the volume and strain of the other phases compared to lda and pbe.@xcite the modification of pbe for solids ( pbesol ) leads to very accurate lattice parameters for the ground state,@xcite it slightly underestimates the cubic lattice constant and cuts the percentage error to one - third relative to lda and pbe .",
    "pbesol does overestimate the @xmath1 ratio of the tetragonal phase but less than pbe.@xcite pbesol also gives much better oxygen - titanium displacements in batio@xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we will discuss an isotropic shell model for batio@xmath0 fitted to results from dft calculations using pbesol .",
    "batio@xmath0 is chosen , since it has a rich phase diagram and it has been used frequently for shell models , which allows for comparisons .",
    "@xcite in section [ theory ] the shell model is discussed as well as the methods behind the fitting procedure and dft calculations . in section [ results ]",

    "the isotropic shell model treats an atom as two coupled charged particles connected by a spring : a core , which holds the atomic mass of the atom , and a massless shell .",
    "all cores and shells interact by coulomb s law except the core and shell of the same atom .",
    "a short - range interaction that interacts only between shells of different atoms describes both electron cloud repulsion and van der waals attraction . the short - range interaction chosen is the buckingham potential and has the form @xmath2 .",
    "the coupled core and shell interact via an anharmonic spring @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the free parameters in the shell model consist of the core and shell charges and the constants in the buckingham and anharmonic spring potentials .",
    "overall charge neutrality adds one constraint for the charges .",
    "the free parameters for the shell model are found through least squares minimization of the energy differences in the potential energy surface between the shell model ( sm ) and the dft calculations ( eqn .",
    "[ chisq ] ) .",
    "the perfect cubic structure was chosen as the reference structure .",
    "minimization of eqn .",
    "[ chisq ] was achieved using the nelder - mead downhill simplex method @xcite .",

    "configurations include randomly displaced atoms from their optimal positions as well as changes in volume and strain .",
    "to determine the shell model energy @xmath5 , for each configuration using a trial set of the shell model parameters , the core of each atom is placed at the ionic position of the atom in the dft configuration . the shell model energy @xmath5 is determined by relaxing the shells .",
    "configurations with energies lower than the cubic phase and with energies close to any of the four phases of batio@xmath0 are emphasized using a weight factor , @xmath6 , to reproduce the dft lattice constants accuarately .",

    "the orthorhombic and tetragonal states were found by relaxing the geometry of the unit cell while restricting the movement of the titanium atom relative to the barium atom to the [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] directions , respectively .",
    "convergence was tested by comparing the calculated zero temperature lattice constants and energies of all four phases of batio@xmath0 with calculations using a plane - wave cutoff of 800 ev and a 8 @xmath7 8 @xmath7 8 mp k - point mesh .",
    "lattice constants and total energies were converged to better than 0.002   and 1 mev / atom respectively .",

    "effectively one core charge is determined from charge neutrality .",
    "the repulsive @xmath8 parameters in the buckhingham potential for the cations were adapted from the work by sepliarsky et al@xcite .",
    "they help in the fitting procedure , in particular by constraining the ti shell , but they have a negligible effect on the shell model energies .",
    "the van der waals interaction from the cations to the oxygen atoms was set to zero because the separation between the core and the shell of the cations is so small that they also have negligible effect on the shell model energies .",
