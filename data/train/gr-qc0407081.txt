    "since the result of andersson @xcite and friedman & morsink @xcite , numerous works have dealt with inertial modes of rotating relativistic stars ( see reviews by friedman & lockitch @xcite , andersson @xcite and kokkotas & ruoff @xcite ) . in perfect fluids ,",
    "these modes have indeed been proven to satisfy the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ; @xcite and @xcite ) criterion for instability whatever the angular velocity of the star is .",
    "hence , due to their coupling to the gravitational field , these oscillations make neutron stars ( nss ) very promising sources of gravitational waves ( gw ) . yet , as nss are complex relativistic objects , far from perfect fluids , the astrophysical relevance of the instability of inertial modes in rotating nss is still an open issue .",
    "the final answer to this question will depend on the many physical phenomena that take place within nss : their initial state at birth @xcite , existence of differential rotation @xcite , of a crust ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , of a huge magnetic field @xcite , of superfluid states of nucleons ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , of exotic particles , _ etc_. understanding better that potential instability is important for two main reasons .",
    "first , if it were proven to be relevant , it could have a great impact on our idea about the evolution of nss and might explain the relatively slow angular velocity of observed pulsars .",
    "moreover , in order for the data collected by gw detectors like virgo or ligo to be useful , they have to be compared with predicted signals , such as the signal that results from the instability of inertial modes .",
    "since theoretical predictions depend on the models used for the inner structure of nss , this confrontation could possibly be as instructive for nuclear physics at high density as was helioseismology for neutrino physics .",
    "+ in a previous article @xcite ( referred to here as paper i ) , we have presented a spectral hydrodynamical code , which uses spherical coordinates , with the aim of studying time evolution of inertial modes in slowly rotating neutron stars . having discussed the motivation for the slow rotation approximation in this previous article ( it is still good even for the fastest known pulsars , see paper i ) , we keep working with it in the present paper . thus , the next step in our project was to improve the linear study of relativistic inertial modes by trying to take into account in a more realistic way the microphysical conditions that occur inside actual nss . among them , we retained the stratification of the star .",
    "it was quite easy to implement , and it is well - known that inertial modes change drastically depending on whether the equation of state ( eos ) that describes the ns is barotropic or nonbarotropic depends only on one variable , for instance the baryonic number density @xmath1 . ] , while the status of purely axial modes of relativistic nonbarotropic nss is still under debate ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it is easy to show that , for the most basic model of a star built with the so - called `` @xmath2 '' matter , the assumption of a barotropic eos , even if easier to use , is wrong as soon as the star is cold enough and the matter not in a stationary state .",
    "hence , here we consider the time evolution of inertial modes in slowly rotating relativistic nss composed of neutrons , protons and electrons , with an `` out - of - equilibrium '' eos .",
    "it should be kept in mind that in the following , we shall call `` nonbarotropic '' a peculiar type of nonbarotropic eoss : the situation of @xmath2 matter with frozen composition . + the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : bg ] , we start with an overview of the basic assumptions made in the study of the structure of cold neutron stars , with emphasis on the beta equilibrium between neutrons , protons and electrons , which constitute , for not too massive nss , the most important part for studies of their oscillations : their core .",
    "we end this section with a description of our calculation of stationary rotating nss and of the eos used to get configurations to perturb in the following sections : the prakash - ainsworth - lattimer ( pal ) eos @xcite . in section [ sec : pertmicro ] , a short summary of the microphysics of `` perturbed '' nss composed of @xmath2 matter is given . in this section ,",
    "we justify the assumption of frozen composition , which is then used in section [ sec : perthydro ] that describes the basis of the linear hydrodynamical study .",
    "the main feature of a nonbarotropic star is the existence of a nondegenerate spectrum for its polar modes , even when it is not rotating . as frozen composition results in a nonbarotropic effective eos ,",
    "these so - called gravity modes ( _ g_-modes ) are studied for the pal eos in section [ sec : gmod ] .",
    "after which , in section [ sec : rotmod ] , we describe inertial modes of rotating nss with the pal eos but without the ( correct ) hypothesis of frozen composition , before ending with gravity and inertial modes in rotating nss taking into account the frozen composition .",
    "finally , the results are discussed in the conclusion .",
    "the outer layers of cold nss are known to play key roles in several physical phenomena , as the early and late cooling of pulsars @xcite , the existence of glitches ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the spectra of x - ray bursts @xcite . yet , since more than @xmath3 of the mass of cold nss is included in their core , outer layers are not relevant at the most basic levels of studies of both the structure of rotating relativistic stars and their oscillations .",
    "thus , in the following , a ns is modeled by its core , and the outer layers are only discussed as time independent boundary conditions for the oscillations ( see section [ sec : gmod ] ) .",
    "+ the minimal nontrivial description of a core of ns is a mixture of neutron , protons , and electrons at a temperature that is sufficiently low for the matter to be degenerate but sufficiently high for the nucleons not to be superfluid .",
    "such conditions , which imply that thermal contributions to the eos can be neglected , are satisfied for @xmath4 , at densities above one tenth of normal nuclear density @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , when a ns has cooled down enough for these assumptions to be valid , the matter has become transparent for neutrinos , which therefore do not contribute to the eos either . + another physical constraint to take into account for the study of both unperturbed and perturbed stars is the electrical charge neutrality , which comes from the very short characteristic time scale of electromagnetic processes . in degenerate",
    "@xmath2 matter , the so - called plasma frequency of electrons , whose inverse give the typical time for the plasma to maintain charge neutrality , is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the chemical potential of electrons similar to @xmath8 mev ( see below ) , with the electron density @xmath9 .",
    "this leads to an electromagnetic relaxation time , which implies that , for our purpose ( phenomena with typical time scales of some ms ) , matter can always be considered as neutral , and there is equality between the electron and proton densities @xmath10 .",
    "this relation also makes thermodynamical quantities functions of nucleon ( baryon ) density @xmath11 and proton fraction @xmath12 only .",
    "furthermore , at baryon densities of the order of @xmath13 , nucleons form a strongly interacting fermi system and matter is very rich in neutrons , while we can replace nucleon masses ( which are assumed to be equal ) by the neutron mass @xmath14 mev .",
    "if we neglect now the coulomb interactions between charged constituents of matter and treat the electrons as a free ultrarelativistic fermi gas , the energy per nucleon ( excluding rest energy of nucleons ) can be written @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nucleon contribution , and the electron term @xmath17 is @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "+ extensive many - body calculations with realistic two - nucleon and three - nucleon forces show that in the whole range of @xmath20 , the energy per nucleon is ( to a very good approximation ) quadratic in the neutron excess parameter @xmath21 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . at @xmath22 , characteristic value for terrestrial nuclear physics ,",
    "this is just the consequence of the charge symmetry of strong - interaction . at @xmath23 ,",
    "this is a numerical fact .",
    "therefore , the @xmath24-dependence factors out , and @xmath16 is given by the formula @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the energy per nucleon of the symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath27 ) , and @xmath28 is the _ symmetry energy _ at nucleon density @xmath1 .",
    "many possibilities exist for these two functions , among them those that form the pal eos @xcite .",
    "this eos , which is retained in this study , will be described in more detail with the presentation of the obtained background stars used for our modes calculations ( section [ sec : bgm ] ) .",
    "however , to be able to calculate these unperturbed stars , another relation is needed to close the system of equations .",
    "this relation comes from the hypothesis of beta equilibrium between neutrons , protons and electrons .",
    "for matter transparent to neutrinos , the equilibrium with respect to the weak - interaction beta - processes @xmath29 implies a relation between the chemical potentials of the matter constituents , @xmath30 , with ( n_b , x_p)=n_b(m_nc^2+e ) the total energy density [ energy per baryon @xmath31 that comes from eq.([e : e.ne ] ) plus nucleon rest energies ] , and @xmath32 . for matter transparent to neutrinos , this relation reads @xmath33 with our quadratic form of the @xmath24-dependence of @xmath16 , eq.([e : en.w0.s ] ) , the beta equilibrium condition involves only the nuclear symmetry term .",
    "we have @xmath34 the resulting fraction of protons for matter in beta equilibrium , denoted by @xmath35 , is determined from @xmath36 or [ e : beteqy ] y^3+y-=0 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "+ the last equation admits analytical solutions ( _ cf .",
    "_ cardan s method ) among which the only real one is [ e : xbeta ] x_p^eq(n_b)- with @xmath39 .",
    "+ then , the barotropic eos in beta equilibrium , which is used for the calculation of unperturbed stars , is obtained from [ e : rho.bar.eos ] _",
    "eq(n_b)=(n_b,(n_b ) ) , with the total pressure [ e : p.bar.eos ] p_eq(n_b)=n_b^2 .",
    "|_x_p . note that when the chemical potential of the electrons is above the rest mass of muons , , taking into account the appearance of the latter via the equilibrium between the processes e^-^-+_e+| _ ^-e^-+|_e+ _ , would have implied higher proton fractions .",
    "but as a rule , the role of muons is practically irrelevant , as far as the eos is concerned , and we shall always neglect them .",
    "the numerical solution of the einstein s equations for a cold stationary rotating relativistic star with a barotropic eos , @xmath40 [ reached by eq.([e : rho.bar.eos ] ) and ( [ e : p.bar.eos ] ) ] , has now become a classical problem ( see @xcite for a review ) whose detail we will not enter into here .",
    "let us just remind the reader of the main assumptions :    - : :    there are two killing vectors @xmath41 ( timelike at spacelike    infinity ) for stationarity and @xmath42 ( with closed orbits ,    spacelike everywhere except on the so - called rotation axis where it    vanishes ) for axisymmetry ; - : :    spacetime is asymptotically flat , the metric @xmath43    `` tends toward '' the flat minkowski metric @xmath44 at    infinity ; - : :    matter is a perfect fluid whose energy - momentum tensor    is [ e : perfflu ] * t*(+p ) uu+p*g * , where @xmath45 is the    @xmath46-velocity of the fluid .",
    "obviously , @xmath47 and    @xmath48 are measured in the frame comoving with the fluid    and thus are the equilibrium functions obtained in the previous    section ; - : :    the velocity field corresponds to rigid axisymmetric rotation and can    be written [ e : dec_u ] u = (+ ) , where @xmath49 is by definition    the angular velocity of the star and @xmath50 a scalar    field such as the norm of @xmath45 is @xmath51 ( with    our convention for the signature ) .    with these assumptions ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor satisfies the condition of circularity @xcite and the _",
    "maximal slicing quasi - isotropic _ coordinates @xcite can be adopted to write the metric as    [ e : met_msqi ] s^2 g _",
    "x^ x^ - (n^2-n_n^ ) t^2 - 2n _ t + (r^2+r^2 ^ 2+b^4r^2 ^2 ^2 ) ,    where we have introduced the notation of the @xmath52 formalism : @xmath53 is the lapse and @xmath54 the third component of the shift @xmath55-vector , with the covariant @xmath56-component of the latter .",
    "+ because of the existence of two killing vectors all the functions only depend on ( @xmath57 ) , and this choice of coordinates reduces the einstein s equations to a system of elliptic equations that we solve with the fully relativistic spectral code presented in bonazzola _",
    "this code also provides us with what will be the velocity field to perturb in the study of oscillations ( section [ sec : perthydro ] ) . indeed the @xmath50 scalar field , which normalizes the velocity ,",
    "can be shown to satisfy [ e : lbd ] = -(|ps .",
    "|)^- , where @xmath58 denotes the scalar product associated with the metric .      in order to study inertial modes of nss more realistic than simple barotrops ,",
    "we need an eos for the nuclear matter that is also valid when the fluid is not in beta equilibrium ( [ e : beta.proc ] ) .",
    "indeed , as explained in the introduction and as calculations will show in section [ sec : pertmicro ] , a lump of matter transported out of its equilibrium position by an oscillation will not adjust its composition to its new environment instantaneously .",
    "this will require some time , which has to be taken into account in the dynamics since it allows new modes ( see section [ sec : perthydro ] ) to exist .",
    "+ among the numerous eoss that describe nuclear matter in nss , we decided to use the equation proposed by prakash _",
    "@xcite which is among the few which are valid also out of beta equilibrium .",
    "moreover , this analytical eos based partly on the experimental properties of nuclear matter , and partly on the results of many - body calculations of asymmetric nucleon matter , is in fact a set of eoss .",
    "indeed , several possibilities are given for the choice of the symmetry energy function @xmath28 , while the energy per nucleon of the symmetric nuclear matter @xmath26 depends on some parameters .",
    "thus , following prakash _ et al .",
    "_ , we have    [ e : pal1 ] w_0(n_b)e_f^(0)u^ + au+ + 3_i=1,2c_i()^3 (- ) ,    where    - : :    @xmath59 is the free nucleon gas fermi energy at    saturation density ( @xmath60 mev ) ; - : :    the dimensionless variable @xmath61 is    @xmath62 , where is the saturation density of    symmetric nuclear matter ; - : :    the second and third terms , that depend on the constants    @xmath63 and @xmath64 , reproduce the static interactions    between nucleons and are chosen in such a way that the eos is causal ; - : :    the last two terms , that depend on the momentum , mimic the dynamical    part of the strong interaction . in those terms , the    @xmath65 parameters are characteristic lengths associated    to coupling constants @xmath66 .",
    "the first term ( such as    @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) is    attractive at large distances , whereas the second    ( @xmath69 with @xmath70 )    reproduces the repulsive behavior of the strong interaction at short    scales .    in order to separate the kinetic and potential contributions in the symmetry energy , prakash _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite write s(n_b)=(2 ^ -1)e_f^(0 ) (u^-f(u))+s_0f(u ) , where @xmath71 is a function which describes the ( poorly known ) density dependence of @xmath72 . to get",
    ", one has @xmath73 .",
    "+ playing with the form of the functions @xmath26 and @xmath28 enables one to change the values of the compression modulus and the symmetry energy .",
    "however , this analytical eos , that fits known results around the saturation density , has the drawback that , at low densities , it is no longer physical .",
    "indeed , to be realistic at low densities , any eos has to take into account the appearance of nuclei .",
    "hence , for several choices of the key quantities ( such as the value of the compression modulus and the symmetry energy ) within the proposal of prakash _ et al .",
    "_ , pathological features like negative pressure or convective instability appear .",
    "moreover , even for the eoss that do not present these awkward characteristics , the low density part is unphysical and some prescription has to be adopted for the study of modes . + among the functions and the set of parameters that prakash _ et al . _ propose , we retain @xmath74 and take values of the parameters that give a compression modulus of either 180 mev ( model a ) or 240 mev ( model b ) .",
    "in addition , to prevent the troubles linked to low densities , our choice is to _ cut the star _ below a given threshold density . as discussed in section [ sec : bg ] , since the mass of the crust is quite small , this cutoff does not really affect either the metric or the main properties of the star . moreover , adding some boundary conditions on the surface described by the value of the density chosen for the cutoff is an easy way to mimic the phase transition that occurs between the outer - core and the inner - crust .",
    "this point will be discussed in more detail in the sections that deal with modes ( sections [ sec : perthydro ] , [ sec : gmod ] , [ sec : rotmod ] ) but it was noticed now to clarify table [ tab : bg ] . indeed , in this table are summarized the background configurations that we use .",
    "but in order to calibrate the effect of the cutoff on the modes , we tried several values for the density threshold .",
    "hence , in table [ tab : bg ] , we show structural properties of stars for the two eoss that we keep with different central densities and the values that we take for the cutoff density .",
    "this range is consistent with realistic evaluations of the density at crust - core interface ( see @xcite and @xcite ) ] : @xmath75 or @xmath76 baryon.@xmath77 . as a first validation of the cutoff procedure",
    ", we can check that for given eos and central density , the cutoffs imply differences in the gravitational mass of some few percent in the worst case .",
    "finally , note also that the central ( maximal ) proton fraction is always below @xmath78 , which forbids direct urca processes for @xmath2 matter ( see also section [ sec : eosandnon - eq.proc ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the first thing that we shall look at is the influence of our cutoff density on inertial modes . to explore this , we did several time evolutions with the newtonian @xmath0 _ r-_mode as initial data ( see paper i ) .",
    "this purely axial mode was evolved in all backgrounds with different angular velocities of the star , and a typical result is illustrated by fig.[fig : specrmcutvt ] .",
    "this figure depicts the spectra of the @xmath79 component of the velocity for a star of model a(21 ) with an angular velocity of @xmath80 rad.s@xmath81 .",
    "three different values for the cutoff density are used : 0.053 , 0.08 or , that is to say more or less @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath84 of the saturation density @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , in order to test the possible appearance of a continuous spectrum , we draw the spectra calculated at 2 different positions within the star .",
    "thus , the first obvious result is that for this model at that precise angular velocity , we see a discrete spectrum , with the inertial mode ( the higher peak in the spectrum ) that seems to have a frequency around @xmath85 hz .",
    "this value corresponds to a ratio between the relativistic and newtonian frequencies in the rotating frame which is around @xmath86 , in quite good agreement with the results of lockitch _",
    "@xcite for that compactness .",
    "in addition , various inertial modes can be seen that can be identified as the relativistic counterparts of the inertial modes found by lockitch & friedman @xcite , but since it was shown @xcite that none of these modes are relevant for gw with the cfs instability , we shall not describe them in detail .",
    "+    moreover , as can be seen , the influence of the cutoff density on the spectrum of inertial modes is even smaller than for gravity modes .",
    "this can probably be understood from the fact that starting with purely axial initial data we reach a radial velocity smaller than in the case of the _ g-_modes .",
    "this last statement is supported by the comparison between figures [ fig : speccut ] and [ fig : rma21vtvrs ] .",
    "both of these figures depicts spectra for time evolutions of @xmath87 modes in a star of model a(21 ) .",
    "however , for the first one , the spectra of the @xmath79 and @xmath88 components of the velocity correspond to gravity modes in a nonrotating star [ initial data identical to the eq.([eq : denspert2 ] ) and still without velocity ] , while for the second they correspond to the newtonian inertial mode in a barotropic a(21 ) star with . notice that for both calculations the cutoff density is @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "what can be seen is that the orders of magnitude of the @xmath79 component and of the radial component for the main peak are almost the same for gravity modes ( fig.[fig : speccut ] ) , whereas in the case of inertial modes ( fig.[fig : rma21vtvrs ] ) the radial velocity is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath79 component .",
    "this feature can of course also be explained by the fact that the spectra of relativistic inertial modes mainly depend on the compactness of the star as we shall further verify .",
    "notice in addition that , as expected , this inertial mode is not a purely axial mode .",
    "+ the last curve of fig.[fig : rma21vtvrs ] is the spectrum of one of the two independent components of the current quadrupole tensor ( see paper i for the exact definition ) . since this tensor dominates the post - newtonian reaction force @xcite , we shall use it as an indicator of the fastest growing modes , for those that verify the cfs criterion .",
    "this indicator tells us that the already mentioned inertial mode actually seems to be the most unstable one",
    ". however , even if fewer modes can be seen here than in the spectra of the velocity s components , several other modes appear . among them , a peak around @xmath89 hz but also a quite hidden one around @xmath90 hz that is probably the axial - led @xmath91 mode whose stability was discussed by @xcite : it has indeed a frequency in the rotating frame that is some @xmath92 of the frequency of the @xmath0 mode , while in the newtonian case , lockitch _",
    "_ @xcite found a ratio of @xmath93 .",
    "notice that this argument relies on the assumption of `` almost similarity '' of the spectra calculated in the rotating frame for different stars . formulated in another way ,",
    "it just means that the spectra in the rotating frames mainly depend on one global physical parameter , the compactness .",
    "this assumption will be tested in the following .",
    "anyway , this mode was shown not to be relevant for gw , which is supported by its very low presence ( compared with the main peak ) in the @xmath94 spectrum .",
    "it was more noticeable in the velocity s spectra .",
    "+    now that we have analysed the effect of the cutoff density , we shall be able to investigate the inertial modes for all our models . in fig.[fig",
    ": rmallvth ] , one can see the same kind of spectra for the @xmath79 component of velocity using all our background models and changing the angular velocity from @xmath95 to @xmath96 rad.s@xmath81 , while in fig.[fig : rm80vth ] only the curves for @xmath97 rad.s@xmath81 are depicted in order to better see the differences between different stars .",
    "thus , the first comment is that the influence of the background star on the spectra is quite small .",
    "the higher resolution makes that this is better seen in fig.[fig : rm80vth ] , but already in fig.[fig : rmallvth ] one can observe a very small dispersion of the frequencies . moreover looking carefully , one can discern a cross inside the highest square , _ i.e. _ the square denoting the @xmath98 inertial mode for model b(24 ) .",
    "thus , models a(26 ) and b(24 ) seem to have the same frequency for this mode , which supports the fact that more than the eos , the compactness of the star plays a key - role in the difference between newtonian and relativistic frequencies . indeed , as can be seen in tab .",
    "[ tab : bg ] , those stars have almost exactly the same compactness : 0.189 and 0.191 respectively .",
    "+    next , to test the dependence with respect to @xmath49 of the frequencies , we shall divide all of them by the angular velocity of the star .",
    "since it is pointless for gravity modes , we shall restrict this analysis to the @xmath98 inertial mode , whose dimensionless frequency is illustrated versus the angular velocity for all compactness in fig.[fig : lm2.baro ] . nevertheless , before doing more comments about what turns out from this figure , it is worth to stress its limitation .",
    "indeed , the version of the code used in this study works with a given time step of , and the total duration of the evolutions is always of the order of 1s , whilst the angular velocity changes .",
    "hence , the error bars on frequencies expressed in hz are of about 1 hz , but for frequencies normalised with the angular velocity @xmath49 , they are equal to @xmath99 .",
    "thus , for , this is @xmath100 and this is less than @xmath101 for .",
    "all of this explains why we did not put the data for that were completely meaningless .",
    "+ on this other hand , higher angular velocities of the star imply higher frequencies that give better resolution , which support the compactness dependence of the frequency as shown by fig.[fig : lm2.baro ] .",
    "however , for all angular velocities , the frequencies of the @xmath0 mode for models with compactness @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the same . yet , our main purpose was not to study inertial modes of barotropic stars , but to try to have an idea of the influence of the microphysical conditions , which implies nonbarotropicity , on the spectra .",
    "this is the reason why instead of working with time step and duration scaled by the inverse of @xmath49 ( as we did in paper i ) , we use here only `` physical scales '' that we shall also keep in the next section for the study of the modes of stratified rotating nss .",
    "the first mentioned effect of rotation was the splitting of noninertial modes .",
    "our investigation of the pulsations of rotating stratified relativistic nss will begin with the illustration of this phenomenon within the study of density perturbations in rotating stratified nss . to simplify , we shall first restrict ourselves to the model a(21 ) with various angular velocities , but keeping the cutoff density at @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , since we have verified in the previous sections its low influence , we shall use in the following only that value of the cutoff density .",
    "+ fig.[fig : dn.21.dn.om ] depicts the spectra of the lagrangian perturbation of density .",
    "the initial data consist of the same @xmath87 perturbation of density [ see eq.([eq : denspert2 ] ) ] without any velocity as in section [ sec : gmod2 ] .",
    "as expected , the splitting of the _ g-_modes can be seen , but in addition , we can observe the emergence of some probable inertial modes : see the peaks around and for . the main reasons why these modes can be thought to be inertial modes are that both their frequencies and their relative importance in the spectra grow with the angular velocity . yet , to better describe them , it is worth to have a look at the spectra of the velocity in figs.[fig : vth.21.dn.om ] and [ fig : vr.21.dn.om ] , where we show spectra of the @xmath79 and radial components of the velocity , respectively .",
    "+    first of all , fig.[fig : vth.21.dn.om ] directly shows that not all modes were visible in the spectra of the density .",
    "thus , in addition to the splitted gravity modes and to the already mentioned candidates inertial modes , there are many others that do not correspond to peaks in the density spectra .",
    "we shall now see how we are lead to classify them as axial - led inertial modes , following the classification of lockitch _",
    "_ @xcite . obviously , they are inertial modes since their frequencies increase with the angular velocity .",
    "but our view of classifying them as axial - led is supported by fig.[fig : vr.21.dn.om ] , which shows that the radial velocity for those modes is very small comparatively to the radial velocity of others .",
    "moreover , one of them even seems not to have any radial counterpart ( at this scale of precision ) : the mode with a frequency of for , that is to say the mode with the lowest frequency among those axial - led inertial modes .",
    "+    interestingly , fig.[fig : sij.21.dn.om ] , which depicts the spectra for the current quadrupole tensor , shows that this mode is the mode with the largest contribution to this tensor .",
    "notice anyway that its amplitude is very low ( logarithmic scale ) due to the initial data .",
    "nevertheless , for all the preceding reasons , we can now say that this is the @xmath0 inertial mode , and that table [ tab : bornes ] tells us that its frequency is inside the range of the continuous spectrum .",
    "indeed , its dimensionless frequency in the inertial frame is @xmath104 whereas for model a(21 ) the range is @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "moreover , with the already displayed spectra of velocity , the spectra of a global quantity ( the current quadrupole ) , plus various spectra of velocity calculated in several positions within the star for the barotropic case . ] , we verified that this is a discrete eigenvalue .",
    "+    finally , before we try to investigate the @xmath0 inertial mode in more detail by changing the initial data , let us introduce some axial and polar `` kinetic energies '' that shall help us to study the coupling between polar and axial parts of the modes .",
    "what we shall call `` kinetic energy '' in the following was already introduced in paper i and is defined as _ star ^3",

    "+ with the anelastic approximation , this quantity can be shown to be conserved for a barotropic eos and a vanishing density at the surface , conditions that were verified in paper i. but for nonbarotropic eoss with a cutoff density , two ways to violate this conservation exist . the first one , linked to the eos , corresponds to the existence of a `` chemical '' part of the physical energy , while the second is linked to fluxes through the surface .",
    "to calibrate the violation of the conservation due to fluxes , we did time evolutions of this kinetic energy in barotropic stars with cutoff densities @xmath109 , @xmath75 or @xmath76 baryon.@xmath77 .",
    "we found that for these values , the higher was the cutoff , the better was the conservation , which means that our usual cutoff at @xmath76 baryon.@xmath77 is the best of them .",
    "notice that in all cases we saw temporary violations of the conservation , but the temporal mean value of the energy was always conserved .",
    "moreover , even in the worst cases , the violation were never higher than @xmath110 .",
    "on the other hand , testing the influence of the `` chemical energy '' , we verified that for nonbarotropic eoss with a cutoff at @xmath76 baryon.@xmath77 , the mean value was no longer conserved , but the violation was only of the order of some @xmath55 percents .",
    "for all these reasons , we shall work in the following with this ( kinetic ) energy as a not too bad indicator of the energetic behavior of the oscillations , at least as far as the coupling between polar and axial parts is concerned .",
    "+ indeed , we remind that our algorithm for the solution of euler s equations ( see paper i ) relies on the use of the radial velocity and two scalar potentials whose angular divergence and curl enable us to recover the usual spherical components . by using these variables , the separation of the polar and axial parts of the velocity field is done very easily , which naturally leads to the polar and axial kinetic energies . thus , fig.[fig : en.21.dn.om ] that displays the time evolution of the ratio between the polar kinetic energy and the total kinetic energy give a first insight on the energy flows between the polar and axial parts of the modes .",
    "+ in this figure , time evolutions of the ratio are shown , whose duration is only @xmath111 ms in order to make visible the `` quasistationnarity '' that is reached after a while . as can be seen , starting with a purely polar perturbation , the proportion of the energy stored in polar modes is indeed decreasing down to a fraction that is between @xmath96 and @xmath112 , depending on the angular velocity of the star : the faster it rotates , the more energy flows to axial modes .",
    "notice anyway that since the initial data are a perturbation of density without any velocity , at the very beginning , there is , rigorously speaking , no kinetic energy .",
    "but in fact , from the very first time steps the perturbation of density implies a velocity which is initially purely polar .",
    "moreover , we encountered quite similar results when we did some tests with as initial data a purely polar velocity field without any density perturbation . only the ratio was slightly changed , whilst the time scales were identical .",
    "nevertheless , the relevant issue concerning energy flows will be how barotropicity affects this evolution .",
    "this will be one of the topics of the next section .",
    "we shall now study the time evolution of oscillating out - of - equilibrium nss with different initial data : the @xmath113 inertial mode instead of a density perturbation . in this way",
    ", the differences with the barotropic case shall be easier to notice , while we should also be able to see how much our previous results for nonbarotropic stars depend on the initial data . to start with , fig.[fig : dn.21.rm.om ]",
    "depicts the spectra of the lagrangian perturbation of density for this case , with the results already presented in fig.[fig : dn.21.dn.om ] for comparison .",
    "the first thing to comment on is that even for low angular velocity , gravity modes appear , with , as expected , an amplitude that grows with @xmath49 .",
    "but it shall also be pointed out that the @xmath98 and @xmath91 inertial modes are visible , even if we consider the density perturbation spectra , and that their amplitudes stay the same for all values of @xmath49 .",
    "but the coupling between axial and polar parts of the velocity field should be better investigated with the spectra of the velocity components .",
    "these are displayed in figs.[fig : vth.21.rm.om ] and [ fig : vr.21.rm.om ] .",
    "+    fig.[fig : vth.21.rm.om ] shows that the @xmath79 component of the velocity is hardly affected by the fact that the star is a barotrop .",
    "the main difference between the spectra is indeed only that , for nonbarotropic stars , gravity modes appear , with amplitudes that become higher for faster rotating stars .",
    "even the frequency of the @xmath0 inertial mode is almost exactly the same .",
    "but on the other hand , the radial part of the velocity ( fig.[fig : vr.21.rm.om ] ) is completely changed and quite strongly depends on the angular velocity , which was predictable .",
    "thus , for slowly rotating stars , gravity modes dominate and the radial velocity of the inertial mode is some two orders of magnitude lower than in the case of a barotropic star . yet , for increasing angular velocity , the amplitude and the frequency of the radial part of the @xmath0 inertial mode become more and more similar to what they are in a barotropic star . for , there is less than one order of magnitude difference between the barotropic and the nonbarotropic cases for the @xmath98 mode ( whose frequency in the inertial frame is in this case ) , whereas there was two orders for . on the other hand ,",
    "it should be pointed out that also the amplitude of the _ g-_modes grows with @xmath49 ( probably meaning that their `` inertial '' part is on the way to dominate buoyancy ) while many of the inertial modes that existed for barotropic stars have disappeared .",
    "+    if we now look at fig.[fig : sij.21.rm.om ] that depicts the spectra for the current quadrupole tensor , we shall observe that from the point of view of gw emission , barotropicity seems not to have a major impact , at least in the spectrum . indeed",
    ", the spectra of this tensor do not show remarkable differences , with only a small shift in the frequency of the probably most unstable mode that can be pointed out .",
    "we shall now investigate in more detail how this shift in the frequency depends on the eos , after a brief comment on the time evolution of the ratio between polar and axial kinetic energies . +    indeed , while all previous spectra were very comparable , the time evolutions of the polar and axial parts of the kinetic energy are quite different for barotropic and nonbarotropic stars .",
    "the latter situation is illustrated by fig.[fig : en.21.rm.om ] ( out - of - equilibrium case ) , and by fig.[fig : en.21.baro.om ] ( barotropic case ) .",
    "thus , one observes that , for a barotropic star , energy is fast flowing back and forth from the axial part to the polar part , leading to a kind of `` stationary state '' with a medium value of the ratio around @xmath101 . on the other hand , for nonbarotropic stars , the coupling between polar and axial parts seems to depend much more on the angular velocity .",
    "hence , for @xmath114 or , even after @xmath115 ms of evolution , the `` final state '' is still not reached and the ratio still grows .",
    "but the curves for higher angular velocities suggest that they should not get too high since the `` stationary situations '' obtained in those cases are characterized by ratios lower than for barotropic stars ( always less than @xmath116 ) . + the difference between the typical times is quite easy to understand .",
    "indeed , energy flows should have for typical time scales the periods of the modes measured in the rotating frame . for nonbarotropic stars , whatever the angular velocity , some _ g_-modes exist with periods of some ms , which are then responsible for the quite fast flows .",
    "however , in the barotropic case , only inertial modes can be observed .",
    "since they have periods proportional to the inverse of the angular velocity , this is the explanation of the two features of the barotropic case : the self - similarity ( for different values of @xmath117 ) of the time evolutions and the acceleration of the flows with @xmath117 .",
    "+ on the other hand , with some caution due to our numerous approximations ( and also to our definition of `` kinetic energy '' ) , we could say that the result concerning amplitude of the ratios can be seen as an indication than stratification probably helps the unstable inertial mode ( the @xmath0 _ r-_mode ) to be driven to instability by gw since its coupling to polar modes ( which are not driven to instability by the current quadrupole ) is smaller . yet , the answer to that question requires a proper treatment of the emission of gravitational waves without the cowling approximation , while different viscosities for polar and axial modes should also complicate the problem .",
    "+    to conclude this work , we shall give an overview of how the frequency of the @xmath0 inertial mode depends on compactness , barotropicity and angular velocity .",
    "the latter will be the easier : as already discussed , due to the error bars for the normalized frequencies , we are not really able to see any difference .",
    "moreover , since our study is linear in @xmath49 , we expect that the normalized frequency of the inertial modes should only depend on the compactness of the stars but not on @xmath49 .",
    "this view is supported in the barotropic case and in the nonbarotropic case by ( respectively ) both figs.[fig : lm2.baro ] and [ fig : lm2.nonbaro ] .",
    "thus , the more compact a ns is , the higher will be its dimensionless frequency as measured by an inertial observer .",
    "however , the comparison between these two figures shows that taking into account the fact that @xmath2 matter should keep a frozen composition , which implies a nonbarotropic eos , leads to lower frequencies .",
    "moreover , it is worth pointing out that we verified that , for all of our models , the @xmath0 inertial modes had discrete spectra , even if fig.[fig : lm2.nonbaro ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : bornes ] demonstrate that all these modes were found within the range of the continuous spectra .",
    "nevertheless , as already mentioned and as can be seen in fig.[fig : vr.21.rm.om ] , they are modes with a radial velocity , which means that they are not purely axial . for very slowly rotating stars , this radial component is quite small , but it becomes as large as what it is for nonpurely axial inertial modes of barotropic stars when the angular velocity increases . finally , notice that even if models a(26 ) and b(24 ) have the same compactness and then the same frequency for the @xmath0 inertial mode , due to the mixing with gravity modes that depends on the detail of the microphysics , their full spectra are quite different .",
    "this issue is illustrated by fig.[fig : spec.vr.comp ] that depicts the spectra of the radial component of the velocity for those models with the out - of - equilibrium hypothesis .",
    "hence , this probably means that more precise studies including more coupling between modes ( nonlinear terms in @xmath49 or nonlinear corrections to the euler equations ) should enable us to make some differences between stars of the same compactness , and then to start to probe the inner composition of nss when gravitational waves emitted by their instabilities are detected .",
    "inertial modes and gravity modes of slowly rotating relativistic stratified neutron stars have been investigated in the linear regime .",
    "our study is based on a spectral three dimensional evolutionary code which has , at the moment of writing , the restrictions of using the cowling and the anelastic approximations .",
    "however , the effect of the latter approximation is mainly to kill high frequency acoustic modes that should not be strongly coupled to inertial and gravity modes for slow rotation .",
    "additionally , the slow rotation approximation is reasonable for observed pulsars as , even for the fastest known pulsar , the pertinent dimensionless parameter is of the order of some percents .",
    "the validity of the cowling approximation is more subtle since without perturbations of space - time we do not directly include gravitational waves in our calculations , whereas they are one of the main motivations for this work .",
    "nevertheless , previous studies have proven that the properties of inertial modes were not too much affected by its use @xcite .",
    "+ another major feature of our work is that we tried to simulate as well as possible the microphysical conditions that should occur inside not too massive and not too cold neutron stars .",
    "thus , by using a quite realistic equation of state for nuclear matter valid even when the beta equilibrium is broken , we did the first three dimensional time evolution of inertial modes in stratified relativistic stars , taking into account the frozen composition of every perturbed lump of @xmath2 matter . with this approach",
    ", we were able to show that the coupling between polar and axial modes quite strongly increases with the angular velocity .",
    "this happens in such a way that , in nonbarotropic stars , initially axial inertial modes develop a radial part that can be as large as the polar part of the general inertial modes of barotropic stars .",
    "yet , several of the polar - lead inertial modes of barotropic stars do no longer exist in nonbarotropic stars .",
    "moreover , we found that the characteristic time scale for the exchanges of energy between polar and axial modes is different for barotropic and nonbarotropic stars .",
    "thus , the coupling of inertial modes with gravity modes in nonbarotropic stars seems to give birth to fast energy interchange between the polar and axial parts of the fluid motion .",
    "this phenomenon could have some implications on the way viscosity or gravitational waves emission act , but it would of course need further studies to draw robust conclusions .",
    "+ however , the comparison of inertial modes in stars with and without the assumption of frozen composition has already lead us to the conclusion that nonbarotropicity decreases the influence of compactness on the frequency of the _",
    "r-_mode , making in addition this frequency slightly lower in a nonbarotropic star .",
    "if further studies with different equations of state and composition support this result , it could mean that the measurement of the global parameters of a neutron star ( compactness , mass and radius if absorptions lines are observed , binary system parameters , _ etc .",
    "_ ) in conjunction with the observation of gravitational waves emitted by some instabilities of the inertial modes would be very instructive about the inner structure of neutron stars .",
    "but such a grail would probably need to first improve our understanding of the physics with wider explorations of the physical parameters : centrifugal terms and deformation of the star , magnetic field , differential rotation , nonlinear coupling , _ etc .",
    "_ among them , superfluidity is one of the key phenomena , since several studies proved that gravity modes are suppressed by its existence . as a consequence ,",
    "even if superfluidity in old neutron stars is already strongly supported by both theory and observation ( glitches ) , the detailed analysis of the gravitational wave spectra of oscillating neutron stars could be the possibility to definitely demonstrate the superfluid nature of the neutron stars content by the lack of well understood features linked with gravity modes .",
    "we are indebted with j.a .",
    "pons for his very critical reading of the manuscript and for his numerous comments , but it is also a real pleasure to thank n. andersson and a. nagar for many useful suggestions . finally , we would like to thank the computer department of the paris - meudon observatory for the technical assistance . this work has been supported by the eu programme ` improving the human research potential and the socio - economic knowledge base ' ( research training network contract hprn - ct-2000 - 00137 ) .",

    "in this appendix , the usual basic way to derive the newtonian dispersion relation for _",
    "g-_modes is summarized , and we briefly discuss the effect of the divergence free and anelastic approximations .      the easiest way to reach the dispersion relation for gravity restored modes is based on the perturbative lagrangian approach . if we restrict ourselves to linearized equations , and write @xmath118 the displacement vector , @xmath119 the lagrangian perturbations and @xmath120 the eulerian ( linked by the symbolic relation @xmath121 ) , we have for the euler equation [ e : ee ] _ t^2=-p-- and for the mass conservation equation [ e : cons_n ] n =- nps . , where @xmath47 is the pressure , @xmath122 the gravitational potential and @xmath123 indicates the usual euclidean scalar product .",
