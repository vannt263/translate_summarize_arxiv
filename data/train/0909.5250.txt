    "lagrangian and legendrian singularities can be found in many problems of differential geometry , calculus of variations and mathematical physics .",
    "one of the most successful their applications are the study of singularities of caustics and wavefronts .",
    "for example , the particles incident along geodesics from a smooth hypersurface in a riemannian manifold to conormal directions define a lagrangian submanifold at a point in the cotangent bundle and define a legendrian submanifolds at a point in the @xmath0-jet bundle .",
    "the caustic generated by the hypersurface is regarded as the caustic of the lagrangian map defined by the restriction of the cotangent bundle projection to the lagrangian submanifold and the wavefront generated by the hypersurface is regarded as the wavefront of the legendrian map defined by the restriction of the @xmath0-jet bundle projection to the legendrian submanifold .",
    "therefore the studies of the caustics and wavefronts generated by smooth hypersurfaces are reduced to the studies of lagrangian and legendrian singularities .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite we investigated the more general cases when the hypersurface has a boundary , a corner , or _",
    "an @xmath1-corner_. in these cases particles incident from each edge of the hypersurface gives a _",
    "symplectic regular @xmath1-cubic configuration _ at a point of the cotangent bundle which is a generalisation of the notion of lagrangian submanifolds and particles incident from each edge of the hypersurface gives a _ contact regular @xmath1-cubic configuration _ at a point of the @xmath0-jet bundle which is a generalisation of the notion of legendrian submanifolds .",
    "the caustic generated by the hypersurface germ with an @xmath1-corner is given by the caustic of the symplectic regular @xmath1-cubic configuration which is a generalisation of the notion of _ quasicaustics _ given by s.janeszko ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "in these papers we investigated the stabilities of caustics and wavefronts generated by the hypersurface with an @xmath1-corner by studying the stabilities of _ reticular lagrangian , legendrian maps _ which are generalisations of the notions of lagrangian , legendrian maps for our situations .    in this paper , we investigate the genericities of caustics and wavefronts generated by a hypersurface with an @xmath1-corner . in order to realize this purpose",

    ", we shall need to prove that the _ stabilities _ and the _ transversally stabilities _ of reticular lagrangian , legendrian maps are equivalent respectively .",
    "these proofs are simpler than that of the assertions ( 1)@xmath2(5 ) of theorem 5.5 in @xcite and theorem 7.4 in @xcite respectively .",
    "the main results in this paper are generic classification of caustics generated by the hypersurface with an @xmath1-corner on an @xmath3 dimensional manifold in the cases @xmath4 and @xmath5 and a generic classification of wavefronts generated by the hypersurface with an @xmath1-corner on an @xmath3 dimensional manifold in the cases @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in order to realize this",
