    "one of the challenges faced by galaxy formation models is to explain the population of today s red massive quiescent elliptical galaxies . in the current hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm",
    "massive galaxies are formed via mergers of less massive galaxies which in turn fuel intense star formation and feed massive black holes .",
    "one of the main difficulties is to find mechanisms to stop the processes of intense star formation , and to allow galaxies to migrate from the so - called blue cloud or late - type star forming galaxies to the so - called red sequence or early - type quiescent galaxies ( see e.g. , bell et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has been proposed as an efficient process for suppressing any further star formation in the late stages of galaxy evolution , while still allowing for continuing black hole growth ( see e.g. , springel , di matteo , & hernquist 2005 and croton et al .",
    "see hopkins et al .",
    "( 2007 , and references therein ) for a detailed discussion on this and other related issues .",
    "some tantalizing evidence of the possible role of agn in galaxy evolution is the location of local optically selected agn ( e.g. , salim et al .",
    "2007 ; martin et al . 2007 ) and moderate-@xmath10 x - ray selected agn ( snchez et al . 2004 ; nandra et al . 2007 ) in the transition between the red sequence and the top of the blue cloud , the region also known as the green valley. these intermediate colors may indicate that agn play a role in causing or maintaining the quenching of star formation .",
    "however , in the local universe agn with strongly accreting black holes tend to be hosted in massive galaxies with blue ( i.e. , star - forming ) disks and young bulges ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003b , 2007 ) implying a close link between the growth of black holes and bulges .",
    "clearly the relationship between agn and star - formation is a matter of strong debate .",
    "about half of the sources with x - ray luminosities @xmath11 ( i.e. , suggestive of the presence of a moderately luminous agn ) detected in deep ( @xmath12ms ) x - ray surveys do not show broad lines or high excitation lines characteristic of agn in their optical spectra ( see e.g. , barger et al . 2001 ; cohen 2003 ; szokoly et al .",
    "2004 and review by brandt & hasinger 2005 ) . since the agn emission of these optically - dull agn does not dominate their rest - frame uv to near - infrared ( nir ) emission ( rigby et al .",
    "2006 ) , they are the ideal targets to study their host galaxies and investigate the role of agn in galaxy evolution .",
    "in this paper we study the host galaxies of x - ray selected agn with stellar dominated spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath13 ) in the _ chandra _ deep field south ( cdf - s ) using uv , optical , nir , and _ spitzer",
    "the agn host galaxy properties are then compared with those of irac - selected ( i.e. , stellar mass selected ) galaxies at similar distances studied by prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . throughout this work we assumed the following cosmology : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "we first started with all the cdf - s x - ray sources ( giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ; alexander et al . 2003 ) with spectroscopic and photometric redshifts in the range of @xmath13 ( zheng et al .",

    "( 2008 ) using a separation of @xmath19arcsec .",
    "the 75% completeness limits for the cdf - s field in this sample are @xmath1jy and @xmath20jy at @xmath21 m and @xmath18 m , respectively .",
    "we also used the cdf - s photometric catalogs of prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to construct the seds of the x - ray sources .",
    "these catalogs include the two other irac bands , uv , optical , nir , and _ spitzer_/mips @xmath22 m data ( see prez - gonzlez et al . 2005 , 2008 for a complete description of the dataset and source matching ) .",
    "the mips @xmath22 m catalog is 75% complete down to @xmath23jy . we finally cross - correlated the x - ray sources with the _",
    "spitzer_/mips @xmath24 m catalog for the cdf - s ( papovich et al .",
    "2007 ) which is @xmath25 complete for sources with flux densities down to @xmath26mjy .    out of the 112 x - ray sources with irac detections in the field described above , we selected for this study agn with stellar - dominated uv through nir seds , and in particular with a strong @xmath1 m bump .",
    "our selection thus excluded x - ray sources with agn - dominated seds such as ir power - law galaxies ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2006 ; donley et al .",
    "2007 ) , irac color - color selected agn ( lacy et al . 2004",
    "; stern et al . 2005 ) and galaxies without a prominent @xmath1 m bump ( e.g. , daddi et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we also removed from our sample x - ray sources with nearby companions of similar brightness which could contaminate the observed mid - ir ( mir ) seds , in particular the irac bands .",
    "the final sample contains 58 agn .",
    "most ( 52 of the 58 ) agn in our sample have spectroscopic redshifts and type classifications ( szokoly et al .",
    "2004 ; vanzella et al .",
    "2006 ) . the majority ( 46 out of the 52 )",
    "are classified as optically - dull , that is , agn without any evidence for accretion from their optical spectra .",
    "these included agn classified as low excitation and absorption line agn ( see szokoly et al .",
    "2004 ) . the remaining 6 agn with spectroscopic information show high excitation lines or broad lines ( szokoly et al .",
    "2004 ) , and will be referred to as optically - active agn . for the 6 agn in our sample without spectroscopic information we estimated photometric redshifts ( see next section ) .",
    "the rest - frame seds of the 58 agn are shown in figure  1 for two different redshift bins : @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which correspond to approximately similar ranges of cosmic times for the assumed cosmology .",
    "the selected agn have rest - frame absorption - corrected hard ( @xmath29kev ) x - ray luminosities above @xmath30 ( from tozzi et al .",
    "figure  2 compares the x - ray column densities with the absorption - corrected hard x - ray luminosities ( from tozzi et al .",
    "2006 ) for all the x - ray sources ( open circles ) detected by irac in the goods field .",
    "we marked the agn with stellar - dominated seds selected for this study as filled circles .",
    "2 clearly shows that a large fraction of agn with hard x - ray luminosities below @xmath31 have seds dominated by stellar emission ( see also donley et al .",
    "2007 ) . at higher hard x - ray luminosities",
    "only those agn with large x - ray column densities have stellar seds ( see also , polletta et al . 2006 , 2007 ) . at low absorptions ( @xmath32 )",
    "the agn emission becomes more apparent in the integrated seds , but there are some x - ray sources with low @xmath33 with stellar - dominated seds .",
    "these sources will be studied in more detail in  4.1 .",
    "the x - ray properties of our sample of agn ( fig .  2 ) are consistent with recent findings on the nature of optically - dull agn .",
    "rigby et al . ( 2006 ) estimated that in @xmath34 of optically - dull agn the agn emission lines could be diluted by the stellar emission from the host galaxy ( see also moran , filippenko , & chornock 2002 ) , whereas in the rest extinction from the host galaxy may be responsible for hiding the agn optical lines .",
    "the latter conclusion was based on the comparison of the inclination angle distributions of the host galaxies of optically - dull and optically - active agn .",
    "recently , caccianiga et al . ( 2007 ) proposed that the most likely explanation for optical dullness at low x - ray luminosities is dilution by a massive host galaxy , while at high x - ray luminosities the dullness is due to absorption .",
    "this section describes briefly ( see prez - gonzlez et al . 2008 for a full description ) the procedure for modelling the seds at wavelengths @xmath35 m .",
    "this modelling is general to the irac - selected sample of prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) from which we extracted the stellar masses ( this section ) and sfrs ( next section ) for our sample of agn .",
    "the method involves a two step process in which the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are fitted first , and then used as templates to fit the seds ( and photometric redshifts ) of those galaxies without spectroscopic redshifts .    for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts",
    "the stellar emission is generated with the pegase code ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) assuming a salpeter imf ( salpeter 1955 ) between 0.1 and 100m@xmath36 .",
    "we assumed that the stellar emission of the galaxies can be described with one or two stellar populations . in the case of the one stellar population model",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is modeled with a declining exponential ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the four free parameters to fit are : extinction ( using the calzetti et al .",
    "2000 law ) , metallicity , the time scale of the exponential law ( @xmath38 ) , and the age ( @xmath39 ) of the stellar population . in the case of two stellar populations ,",
    "the old stellar population is described as for the one stellar population model ( four free parameters ) , and the young stellar population is assumed to have been formed in an instantaneous burst with three free parameters : extinction , metallicity , and age .",
    "for the two stellar population models the burst strength is another free parameter that relates the mass of young stars with the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "in addition to the stellar emission , we include the hydrogen gas emission in the form of nebular continuum and emission lines .",
    "once the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are fitted , they are used as templates for fitting the seds of those galaxies without a spectroscopic redshift . with the best model and best photometric redshift established ,",
    "the stellar mass of the galaxy is obtained by scaling the models to the observed sed .",
    "the value of the stellar mass ( @xmath2 ) is computed as the average of the stellar masses computed for each observed photometric band . although most ( 52 out of 58 ) of the agn in our sample have spectroscopic redshifts ( szokoly et al .",
    "2004 and vanzella et al .",
    "2006 ) , we refitted their seds using the library of templates .",
    "the stellar masses derived with the photometric redshift were then rescaled to the spectroscopic redshift .    as discussed in great detail by prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) there are a variety of effects that can introduce systematics in the determination of stellar masses .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic uncertainties associated with fitting the seds ( typically a factor of @xmath40 ) , other effects include the choice of stellar population libraries , extinction law , and imf , as well as the number of stellar populations ( in our case , one population vs. two populations ) .",
    "these effects introduce uncertainties of the order of or smaller than those intrinsic to the sed fitting .",
    "even though we selected our agn such that their seds are clearly dominated by stellar emission , a valid concern is the possible effect of the agn emission in the determination of the stellar masses . in particular ,",
    "such concern was raised by daddi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) when estimating the stellar masses of @xmath41 galaxies with mir excesses thought to host obscured agn .",
    "these authors argued that the possible agn contribution in the form of hot dust at @xmath42 m might cause overestimation of the stellar masses , but only at a modest level and generally within the systematic errors .    daddi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) estimated the stellar masses using empirical calibrations based on @xmath43 , @xmath10 , and @xmath44-band photometry .",
    "we believe our method is less susceptible to the effects of agn because we use population synthesis models to fit the entire observed seds , and the stellar masses are computed as the average of the stellar masses in all the photometric points .",
    "prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) discussed in detail the effects of the presence of a hot dust component ( which could be associated with an agn ) in the determination of the stellar masses of agn .",
    "they concluded that the agn effects on the estimated stellar masses are negligible for x - ray sources with observed ( i.e. , not corrected for absorption ) luminosities @xmath45 ( see also donley et al .",
    "all the agn in our sample are well below this limit .",
    "in this section , we evaluate whether the mir emission of our sample of agn is likely to be due to the agn or to star formation .",
    "we then use the _ spitzer _ data to model the total ir ( @xmath46 m ) luminosity ( @xmath47 ) and to derive sfrs .",
    "the x - ray column density can be used to classify agn into type 1 ( direct view of the agn , @xmath48 ) and type 2 ( obscured view of the agn ) .",
    "rigby et al . ( 2004 ) using local agn templates showed that for low column densities the @xmath22 m to hard x - ray flux ratio should remain approximately constant , whereas for high column densities this ratio varies by factors of a few .",
    "we test whether the @xmath22 m emission can be solely explained as produced by dust heated by the putative agn , or whether an additional mechanism ( i.e. , star formation ) is needed .",
    "this is tested for the eighteen optically - dull agn ( that is , those without evidence for accretion from the optical spectra ) in our sample with @xmath48 .",
    "to do so , we scaled the median quasar template of elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to the @xmath29kev flux ( from tozzi et al . 2006 ) for each of the 18 optically - dull agn with low @xmath33 .",
    "the predicted agn @xmath22 m flux densities were then compared with observed values .",
    "we only find five optically - dull agn with low @xmath33 ( those in the left panel of fig .",
    "3 ) for which between 30 and 100% of their observed @xmath22 m flux densities could be accounted for with the predictions from their agn hard x - ray fluxes .",
    "these five agn show the highest x - ray fluxes among the optically - dull agn with low @xmath33 . for the rest ( including some galaxies with @xmath49 m excesses ) , the predicted agn @xmath22 m flux densities are below approximately 15% of the observed value , and thus most of their mir emission is probably produced by star formation . in our analysis",
    ", we will assume that star formation dominates the @xmath22 m emission of these galaxies and of those that are similar except for larger absorbing columns for their x - ray sources .    for comparison the middle and right panels of fig .",
    "3 show a few examples of seds of optically - active agn with @xmath50 , and their corresponding scaled quasar templates .",
    "the middle panel includes three optically - active agn in our sample ( szokoly 52 , 53 , and 78 ) .",
    "only the mir emission of one of them ( szokoly 53 ) is fully accounted for by the predictions from the agn x - ray flux . from the right panel of fig .",
    "3 , it is clear that the agn signatures ( uv bump and hot dust emission around @xmath51 m and beyond ) become dominant for the most x - ray luminous agn ( see e.g. , barmby et al .",
    "2006 ; polletta et al . 2006 , 2007 ; donley et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "after the stellar emission was modeled , as described in  3 , the predicted stellar fluxes were subtracted from the observed photometric data points at @xmath52 m . the resulting dust emission out to the mips @xmath22 m photometric point",
    "was then fitted using the chary & elbaz ( 2001 ) models to derive the ir luminosity . for the @xmath22 m non - detections ( 10 out of the 58 agn in our sample ) ,",
    "the @xmath47 was computed assuming an upper limit to the @xmath22 m flux density of @xmath53jy , which is the 50% completeness limit of our catalog .",
    "the unobscured star formation is assumed to be traced by the uv monochromatic 2800  luminosity , as fitted by the stellar model .",
    "the total sfrs were computed as the sum of the ir and uv luminosities converted to sfrs using the prescriptions of kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "although we do not use the mips @xmath24 m photometric points to model the ir luminosities , we can check if the @xmath54 ratios or upper limits are consistent with star formation , as assumed .",
    "only 3 optically - dull agn are detected at @xmath24 m , all of them in the @xmath55 bin ( see papovich et al . 2007 for more details ) .",
    "none of these three sources with @xmath24 m detections have observed @xmath56 ratios consistent with those expected from hot dust arising from a @xmath57 constant distribution ( @xmath58 , similar to optically selected quasars , elvis et al .",
    "1994 see fig .",
    "3 , or agn - dominated sed , see e.g. , alonso - herrero et al .",
    "neither are these colors consistent with those of ir bright agn such as mrk  231 ( @xmath59 , for our redshift range ) .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath56 ratio of optically - dull agn is however similar to other sources ( both detected and undetected in x - rays ) in the same redshift range ( see papovich et al .",
    "2007 ) , as well as to empirical templates of local star - forming galaxies .    since most of the optically - dull agn with low absorptions have only modest x - ray luminosities ( @xmath60 , see fig .",
    "2 ) , we consider the possibility that they do not contain an agn , and thus that their x - ray luminosities could be produced by star formation . to do so , we can compare our total uv+ir sfrs with the sfrs predicted from their hard x - ray luminosities using the relation inferred by ranalli , comastri , & setti ( 2003 ) . in all but one galaxy ( szokoly 577 , which is one of the galaxies with high @xmath61 ratios )",
    "the x - ray based sfrs would be between 3 and 10 times higher than our inferred sfr@xmath62 , indicating that in these galaxies most of the hard x - ray emission is not produced by star formation , and that indeed they contain ( a low luminosity ) agn .      in fig .  1",
    "the observed seds ( normalized at @xmath63 m ) are shown for the two redshift bins , and are sorted according to their fitted @xmath61 ratios .",
    "if the agn contribution to the mir emission is small , these ratios are a good proxy for the specific sfrs ( i.e. , star formation rate per unit stellar mass ) . from the modelling of the stellar seds ( see  3 ) we find that most galaxies with high @xmath61 ratios are fitted with younger models than those with low @xmath61 ratios",
    ".    an independent way to estimate the average ages of the host galaxy stellar populations is to measure the 4000- break ( see kauffmann et al . 2003a , b and references therein ) .",
    "the optical spectra ( from szokoly et al .",
    "2004 ) of some @xmath27 agn with high and low @xmath61 ratios ( as in fig .  1 ) are shown in figure  4 .",
    "the average @xmath64 values for the agn in figure  4 with high and low @xmath61 ratios are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "thus , there is some marginal evidence for the agn host galaxies with the lowest @xmath61 ratios to show larger 4000- breaks ( i.e. , older stellar populations ) than galaxies with high @xmath61 ratios .",
    "these @xmath64 values are similar to those of high-@xmath10 agn identified by kriek et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the measured @xmath64 values for our sample of agn indicate relatively young ages , of between 0.8 and 2.5gyr for an instantaneous burst ( using figure  2 of kauffmann et al .",
    "these ages , as well as the ages of local universe type-2 agn ( kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003b ) and intermediate-@xmath10 type 1 agn ( snchez et al . 2004 ) are younger than those of local quiescent massive galaxies , but consistent with the ages of irac - selected galaxies of similar masses ( see prez - gonzlez et al . 2008 ) .    those galaxies in our sample ( about one - third ) with high @xmath61 ratios ( left panels of fig .",
    "1 ) tend to show an excess of @xmath67 m emission over the expectations of the stellar emission for an evolved stellar population .",
    "although in most cases these mir excesses can be accounted for by the gas + stellar emission associated with a young stellar population , we can not rule out some contribution from warm dust emission associated with the putative agn . by our selection criteria ( i.e. , prominent @xmath1 m stellar bump )",
    ", the mir excesses in our galaxies occur at @xmath68 m , unlike the mir excess galaxies of daddi et al . ( 2007 ) and ir power - law galaxies ( alonso - herrero et al . 2006 ; donley et al .",
    "2007 ) , where the mir excesses appear at @xmath69 m .",
    "however , a large fraction ( two - thirds ) of the sample show no mir excesses out to @xmath70 m , with their mir emission being entirely consistent with that of an evolved stellar populations .",

    "the stellar masses of agn at @xmath82 and @xmath83 are thus intermediate between those of local agn and high-@xmath10 agn .    since the stellar masses of our sample of agn appear to be representative of the whole population of x - ray selected agn ( see fig .",
    "5 ) then we infer that approximately 25% of massive galaxies ( @xmath84 ) at the redshifts probed here contain an x - ray identified agn .",
    "we also took into account agn not included in this study , assuming that they have stellar masses similar to the agn with stellar dominated seds .",
    "this fraction is similar for the two redshift bins considered here , and consistent with the agn fraction in massive galaxies at higher redshifts ( @xmath85 , alexander et al .",
    "2005 ; daddi et al . 2005 ; papovich et al . 2006 ; kriek et al .",
    "our estimated agn fraction in intermediate-@xmath10 massive galaxies is only a lower limit because presumably most compton - thick agn are missed by current x - ray surveys . at @xmath41",
    "the fraction of agn in massive galaxies appears to be as high as @xmath86 ( daddi et al .",
    "2007 ) consistent with the view that the massive black hole growth was higher when the universe was younger .       and @xmath87 mass ranges , respectively .",
    "we also show the quartiles of the distribution of specific sfrs of irac - selected galaxies for each of the two mass ranges as the shaded regions .",
    "the median specific sfrs for agn are the filled squares and triangles plotted at the median redshift .",
    "the horizontal bars represent the ranges of redshifts .",
    "we excluded agn with mir excesses or classified as optically - active .",
    ", width=298 ]    in this section we quantify the star formation activity of agn with stellar - dominated seds in relation to irac - selected galaxies of similar stellar masses and at similar redshifts .",
    "we use the specific sfrs as an indicator of the star formation activity rather than the absolute sfrs , as the specific sfr measures the rate at which new stars add to the assembled mass of the galaxy ( brinchmann & ellis 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , galaxies show distinct specific sfrs depending on their stellar masses and redshifts ( e.g. , brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ; zheng et al .",
    "2007 ; prez - gonzlez et al . 2008 ) , so the comparison needs to be made taking this into account .",
    "figure  7 compares the median specific sfrs for intermediate-@xmath10 agn with those of the irac - selected sample of prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "in this comparison we excluded mir - excess galaxies and the six optically - active agn , as they may have an important agn contribution to their observed mir emission which would cause us to overestimate their ir - based sfrs . the comparison between agn and irac - selected galaxies",
    "is done for the two relevant stellar mass ranges of the agn hosts ( see figure  5 ) : @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  7 the agn specific sfrs ( at both redshift and mass intervals ) do not appear to be fundamentally different from those of irac - selected galaxies .",
    "moreover , zheng et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argued against agn feedback as the main process for quenching star formation .",
    "their model predicted that agn feedback would be more effective for more massive galaxies ( see also croton et al .",
    "this would imply a more rapid decline of the specific sfr for massive galaxies ( @xmath90 ) than less massive galaxies ( see also springel et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is observed neither for the zheng et al .",
    "( 2007 ) sample nor for the irac - selected sample of prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 , see fig .",
    "in contrast , kriek et al . ( 2007 ) found evidence for a relation between the suppression of star formation and the agn phase for @xmath44-band selected galaxies .",
    "kriek et al .",
    "( 2007 ) however pointed out that their agn sample may be biased toward quiescent galaxies where agn are easier to identify .",
    "in fact , if we consider their two samples of galaxies ( uv and @xmath44-band selected ) then the agn have specific sfrs within the range observed for their non - agn . in the local universe agn",
    "tend to be hosted in massive galaxies with younger stellar ages than non - agn of similar morphological types ( early - type ) and stellar masses ( kauffmann et al . 2003a , 2007 ) .",
    "this was interpreted as evidence that enhanced star formation is a requisite for feeding the agn . at @xmath91 galaxies ( presumably both agn and non - agn ) with @xmath92",
    "are still being assembled ( see prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2008 ) , so perhaps it is not surprising that their star formation rates are not significantly different .",
    "there are a number of caveats when trying assess the star formation activity of our sample of agn .",
    "as discussed in previous sections , there is the exact agn contribution to the mir emission , although it is found generally not to be large (  4.1 ) .",
    "also the agn in the @xmath28 redshift range tend to be more luminous in x - rays so the agn become more apparent . even though we excluded galaxies with mir excesses ( as we can not rule out that they might be due to dust heated by the agn ) , the specific sfrs are formally upper limits .",
    "another largely unknown effect in the comparison between agn and irac - selected galaxies is the possible contamination by x - ray identified agn as well as obscured agn in the most massive ( @xmath93 ) systems ( see  5.1 and daddi et al .",
    "2007 ; kriek et al . 2007 ) in the comparison sample .",
    "another concern is the possibility that the obscuring material , which may be responsible in part for the optical dullness , be associated with star formation activity within the host galaxy ( e.g. , ballantyne , everett , & murray 2006 ; martnez - sansigre et al .",
    "this would bias our sample towards star - forming galaxies when compared to the most optically - active agn not included in our sample .",
    "8 shows a comparison between the derived uv+ir sfrs and the x - ray absorption for our sample of agn .",
    "this figure suggests a weak , if any , connection between star formation and obscuration .",
    "it is also clear that a number of highly obscured agn ( @xmath94 ) do not present high sfrs , and in these cases the obscuration is probably not associated with extranuclear dust in the host galaxy .",
    "summarizing , at intermediate-@xmath10 we do not find strong evidence for either highly suppressed star formation activity or increased star formation activity in agn when compared to irac - selected galaxies of similar stellar masses .",
    "we only observe that the most massive galaxies with low specific sfrs ( see fig .",
    "5 ) follow the redshift evolution of the quenching mass inferred by bundy et al .",
    "this may only indicate that the most massive systems hosting an agn are close to being fully assembled at these redshifts .",
    "the relation between the black hole mass and the bulge luminosity and in particular the bulge stellar mass is now well estalished in the local universe ( e.g. , merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) .",
    "this relationship appears to hold out to @xmath91 ( peng et al .",
    "2006 ) , indicating that massive bulges were fully assembled at this redshift ( see e.g. , glazebrook et al . 2004",
    "; cimatti et al . 2004 ; papovich et al . 2006 ; prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2008 ) . since the agn activity out to @xmath95 seems to be associated with bulge - dominated galaxies ( see snchez et al .",
    "2004 ; grogin et al . 2005",
    "; pierce et al .",
    "2007 ) we can use the local relationship and our stellar masses to estimate the black hole masses of intermediate-@xmath10 agn .    using the marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) relation and assuming that @xmath96",
    ", we find black hole masses for typical agn of approximately between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , with a median value of @xmath99 .",
    "these are in good agreement with the estimates of babi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for cdf - s @xmath100 agn based on stellar masses and stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "the resulting @xmath101 of optically - dull agn are plotted in figure  9 against the absorption - corrected rest - frame hard x - ray luminositiesm luminosities .",
    "if most of the mir emission was produced by dust heated by an agn , one would expect a proportionality between the absorption corrected x - ray luminosities ( a proxy for the agn luminosity ) and the mir luminosities , which is not observed in general for optically - dull agn ( see also rigby et al .",
    "this again suggests that a large fraction of the mir emission relative to the agn luminosity could be due to star formation . ] .    in figure  9",
    "we also show the eddington ratios ( @xmath102 ) calculated using the bolometric corrections ( @xmath103 ) derived for pg quasars by elvis et al .",
    "optically - dull agn at @xmath13 with x - ray luminosities above @xmath104 have eddington ratios close to broad - line agn ( @xmath105 , barger et al .",
    "however for x - ray luminosities below @xmath104 ( comparable to local seyfert galaxies ) the eddington ratios are much lower ( @xmath8 , similar to the findings of babi et al . 2007 ) .",
    "one possibility for the low eddington ratios is that we were overestimating significantly the black hole masses , for instance , if these galaxies were not bulge - dominated .",
    "however , the corrections to the bulge masses ( and thus black hole masses ) would be of the order of @xmath106 to @xmath107 for s0/a and sc types , respectively ( see e.g. , marconi et al .",
    "2004 ; dong & de robertis 2006 ) , assuming that the nir luminosity traces the stellar mass .",
    "recently ballo et al . ( 2007 ) derived bulge magnitudes for x - ray sources in the cdf - s and found that in general in the acs @xmath10-band the bulge to total luminosity ratios are of beween 0.4 and 1 . for the two souces in our sample in common theirs these ratios are @xmath108 . from this , the black hole masses quoted here should be taken as upper limits and eddington ratios lower limits , although the corrections are likely to be relatively small .",
    "the agn hosts in our sample follow very well the redshift evolution of the quasar host mass derived by hopkins et al .",
    "( 2007 ) from the quasar optical luminosity function .",
    "this is interesting because our agn are not x - ray quasars ( i.e. , @xmath109 , see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this is also indirect evidence that the accretion rates of optically - dull agn are lower than those of bright quasars . in  5.1 on the other hand we found that the characteristic stellar masses of intermediate-@xmath10 are between those of local agn and high-@xmath10 ( @xmath110 ) agn .",
    "this would appear to support the interpretation of heckman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the agn downsizing phenomenon . in this scenario ,",
    "the fact that the space density of low luminosity agn peaks at lower redshifts than more luminous agn ( see ueda et al .",
    "2003 ) is explained by a decrease of the characteristic mass of actively accreting black holes ( and thus , stellar mass of the hots ) rather than a decreasing accretion rate ( see also barger et al .",
    "since it is these low x - ray luminosity agn that dominate the x - ray background at the redshifts considered here , the agn downsizing is not only due to a decrease in the characteristic stellar mass ( see  5.1 ) , but also lower eddington ratios .",
    "we studied a sample of 58 x - ray selected agn at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath111 ) in the goods portion of the cdf - s .",
    "the agn were selected such that their rest - frame uv to nir seds were dominated by stellar emission , and in particular , showed a prominent @xmath1 m bump .",
    "this selection minimized the agn contamination which is essential for studying the properties of their host galaxies . since agn with stellar dominated seds",
    "comprise approximately 50% of the population of x - ray selected agn , they are a cosmologically important class of agn .",
    "we fitted their rest - frame uv through mir seds using stellar and dust models to derive the stellar masses as well as the total ( uv+ir ) sfrs .",
    "as previously discussed by other works ( e.g. , severgnini et al .",
    "2003 ; rigby et al . 2006",
    "; caccianiga et al . 2007 ) , the optical dullness might be due to various causes .",
    "we find that dilution by a massive host galaxy is only in part responsible , as the mass of the host galaxy is independent of the x - ray luminosity and absorption of the agn .",
    "extinction on large scales may also play a role , and presumably is relatively prevalent in the lower - mass optically dull agn hosts . from this and the derived stellar masses of a few optically - active agn with stellar seds",
    "we conclude that the derived stellar masses of our sample of agn are representative of the entire x - ray selected agn population at these redshifts .",
    "about one - third of our agn show @xmath112 m excesses above the expected stellar emission from an old stellar population together with high @xmath61 ratios .",
    "although these mir excesses could be interpreted as evidence for the putative agn ( i.e. , hot dust ) , these galaxies tend to have smaller 4000 - breaks .",
    "that is , galaxies with mir excesses have younger average stellar populations ( an indication of recent or on - going star formation ) than galaxies with low @xmath61 ratios .",
    "this may indicate that agn emission is responsible for most of the mir emission only in some galaxies . for the rest of the sample",
    "there is no evidence for agn emission out to approximately @xmath70 m , and their mir emission is likely to be produced mostly by star formation .",
    "x - ray identified agn are found to reside in galaxies with a range of stellar masses ( @xmath113 , for a salpeter imf ) , including the most massive galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "we infer characteristic ( median ) stellar masses of @xmath3 and @xmath4 at median redshifts of 0.67 and 1.07 , respectively .",
    "these stellar masses are intermediate between those of local type 2 agn ( @xmath114 , kauffmann et al .",
    "2003b ) and high-@xmath10 agn ( @xmath115 , kriek et al .",
    "2007 ; daddi et al .",
    "2007 ; alexander et al . 2007 ) . from the comparison with the irac - selected sample of prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we find that approximately 25% of massive ( @xmath116 ) galaxies at these redshifts contain an x - ray identified agn .",
    "using the local relation between @xmath117 and @xmath101 of marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) the inferred black hole masses ( @xmath6 ) are similar to those of broad - line agn although with lower eddington ratios ( @xmath118 ) than luminous quasars .",
    "both findings suggest that , at least at intermediate redshifts , the cosmic agn downsizing is probably due not only to a decrease in the characteristic stellar mass of the host galaxy ( as proposed by heckman et al .",
    "2004 ) , but also to less efficient accretion , as also found by babi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "finally , we do not find strong evidence in agn host galaxies for either highly suppressed star formation ( expected if agn played a role in quenching star formation ) or intense star formation when compared to irac - selected galaxies of similar stellar masses and redshifts .",
    "this can be understood if we take into account that the host galaxies of agn ( and non - agn of similar mass ) are still being assembled at the redshifts probed here .",
    "the main caveats regarding this conclusion are the possible influence on it of the agn contribution to the observed mir emission ( although it is found generally not to be large ) , and the possible bias towards intense star formation which could be in part responsible for obscuring the agn in these objects .",
