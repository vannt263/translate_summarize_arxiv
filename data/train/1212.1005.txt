    "this technique allowed us to observe intraband charge dynamics and investigate the high - frequency electrical properties of graphene .",
    "terahertz spectroscopy is ideal for electrically characterising surface sensitive materials such as graphene as it is a non - contact technique , and covers an important frequency range ( @xmath11 100ghz  @xmath123thz ) for high speed device operation@xcite .",
    "optps measurements were performed with cvd - grown graphene samples in an atmosphere of air , n@xmath13 or o@xmath13 , or in a vacuum . before each set of measurements ,",
    "the sample was left under a vacuum of 10@xmath14 mbar for two hours , to remove existing adsorbants ( see supplementary methods for langmuir coverage calculations ) . for the vacuum measurements ,",
    "the graphene was left for a further two hours with 800 nm ( 1.55ev ) `` pump '' photons incident upon the sample before measurement . for the gaseous measurements ,",
    "1bar of air , n@xmath13 or o@xmath13 was introduced after two hours under vacuum , and measurements were taken after a further two hours , again with the `` pump '' beam incident upon the sample .",
    "measurements were found to be reproducible on different samples and were independent of sample history .",
    "that is , the effect of exposure to any of the gases could be `` reset '' by placing the sample in vacuum for 2 hours .    for the measurements , the electric field of a terahertz pulse transmitted through the graphene",
    "was sampled after photoexcitation by an 800 nm , 180@xmath15j/@xmath10 fluence pump pulse , @xmath16 , and without the photoexcitation , @xmath17 . the photoinduced change in terahertz transmission of the sample ,",
    "@xmath18 was recorded using lock - in detection .",
    "the principle of the measurements is illustrated in figure [ o2]a . the terahertz pulse probes the photoexcited graphene sample at a time @xmath19 after photoexcitation . the terahertz probe is then mapped out in time by varying the difference in time of arrival , @xmath20 , between the terahertz pulse and an 800 nm gate pulse at an electro - optic detection crystal ( gap ) .    in figures [ o2]b and c we present the measured terahertz electric field , @xmath21 , transmitted through graphene in an pure oxygen atmosphere , and the corresponding change in transmission due to photoexcitation , @xmath22 .",
    "the induced @xmath22 decreases as the delay between pump and probe , @xmath19 , is increased .",
    "the photoinduced change in terahertz transmission is seen to decay within @xmath115ps .",
    "further information may be extracted from these data by performing a fourier transform on the electric field data to give directly the frequency dependent complex photoconductivity , @xmath23 , without resorting to the kramers - kronig relations , via @xcite    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the impedance of free space , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the refractive index of the quartz substrate , @xmath28 @xcite at terahertz frequencies .",
    "figures [ o2]d and e show the real and imaginary parts of the photoconductivity respectively as a function of pump  probe delay time .",
    "to more easily compare the photoconductivity in different atmospheres , we take slices of the data from figure [ o2 ] , and the corresponding data for the other environment types . for instance , holding @xmath20 constant at the maximum terahertz electric field ( e.g. @xmath20=0 in figure [ o2]c ) and observing the resulting @xmath22 as pump  probe delay time @xmath19 is varied , yields an optical pump  terahertz probe measurement , which provides the average terahertz response of the sample . in figure [ pumpcomp ] , we plot -@xmath29 , which is proportional to the photoconductivity of the graphene , as a function of the delay time between the pump and probe pulses in the four atmosphere types .",
    "it should be noted that due to the large number of holes already present near the dirac point in this p doped sample , the transient response probed by the terahertz is dominated by electron dynamics",

    "excites carriers far above the dirac point , which cool by phonon emission . in gapless graphene",
    ", terahertz photons can be absorbed by the photoexcited carriers . in the presence of gases , stimulated emission releases extra terahertz photons , yielding a bleaching pump - probe signal.,width=325 ]    immediately after photoexcitation in vacuum , the terahertz conductivity increases ( photoinduced absorption ) within 1ps , and subsequently relaxes with two distinct time scales .",
    "initially fast cooling occurs within @xmath110.6ps , and a longer , exponential cooling occurs with a time scale of @xmath112.5ps .",
    "such a relaxation is consistent with other studies , which associated the first rapid cooling with emission of optical phonons , followed by a bottleneck when the carrier temperature cools below the hot optical phonon temperature ( @xmath33 and 0.162ev @xcite ) , slowing further cooling @xcite .",
    "however , when graphene is placed in a gaseous atmosphere , the photoinduced change is dramatically different .",
    "surprisingly , the photoconductivity signal flips from being purely positive in vacuum to purely negative in all the gas environments .",
    "following photoexcitation in air , n@xmath34 or o@xmath34 , the terahertz conductivity decreases within 1ps , and then relaxes with a common monoexponential time scale of 2.5ps .",
    "the similarity between this time constant and that of cooling in vacuum suggests the continued importance of carrier  phonon interactions .",
    "adsorbed o@xmath35 was found to have the strongest influence on charge dynamics is graphene , with the negative photoconductivity almost an order of magnitude greater than the induced absorption under vacuum .",
    "a negative transient absorption , such as we observe , may be attributed to either stimulated emission in the samples or a bleaching effect .",
    "to understand more about the origin of the negative photoconductivity it is informative to consider the photoconductivity spectra at a fixed time after photoexcitation .",
    "figure [ spectral ] shows the photoconductivity in all four atmosphere types at 2ps after photoexcitation ( @xmath36ps ) .",
    "the spectrum of graphene in vacuum reveals a relatively flat and positive real part of photoconductivity , in stark contrast to the strongly negative ( real ) photoconductivity seen for gas - absorbed graphene .",
    "furthermore the spectral photoconductivity of graphene samples in the presence of n@xmath35 , air and o@xmath35 can be seen to exhibit a lorentzian form , @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the linewidth , and @xmath39 is the resonant frequency .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ spectral ] represent a least square fit of eq .",
    "[ lorentz ] to the experimental data .",
    "the fitted resonant frequency for graphene in air and n@xmath13 was found to be @xmath40thz , compared with @xmath41thz for graphene in an o@xmath13 environment .",
    "the resonance in all gas types is spectrally very broad ; the fitted linewidth was @xmath42thz , independent of the gas type .",
    "the lorentzian fit begins to deviate from the measured photoconductivity at low frequencies .",
    "the deviation is most noticeable for o@xmath35-exposed graphene ( figure [ spectral]d ) .",
    "the non - zero value of re(@xmath43 ) evident in the data at low frequency suggests an underlying drude - like response , however inclusion of a drude term does not enhance the fit within our observable bandwidth , so has been neglected .",
    "in contrast , the photoinduced absorption in vacuum leads to a small , positive , spectrally flat real conductivity , with a non - negligible imaginary part .",

    "the solid black line in * b - d * is a lorentzian model fit to the conductivity data , demonstrating the lorentzian form the of photoconductivity in gaseous environments .",
    "shading is used to emphasise the change from positive to negative im(@xmath43 ) .",
    "this point corresponds to the peak lorentzian frequency , @xmath39.,width=325 ]    a negative transient absorption signal with a lorentzian lineshape is characteristic of stimulated emission .",
    "hence , our data provide evidence that stimulated emission of terahertz photons is occurring in photoexcited graphene in the presence of atmospheric gases .",
    "theoretical studies have predicted amplified stimulated emission of terahertz radiation from sufficiently intensely photoexcited graphene@xcite .",
    "the proposed mechanism is that after photoexcitation , the charge carriers relax and populate states around the dirac point , from where they can radiatively recombine . thus terahertz emission over a large spectral range",
    "is expected to be possible@xcite . whilst our measurements do not show amplification of the terahertz probe ( losses are still greater than gain ) , stimulated terahertz emission , below the gain threshold is consistent with our observations .",
    "we now consider the mechanism for the dramatic changes of photoconductivity in graphene under the different gas environments .",
    "the ability to `` reset '' the effects of gas exposure by placing the graphene samples in vacuum for two hours ( at room temperature ) suggests that the gas molecules are physisorbed rather than chemisorbed to the graphene surface .",
    "physisorption of o@xmath35 and n@xmath35 on graphene could act as a dopant @xcite , lead to the opening of a small bandgap at the dirac point @xcite , and/or lead to a modification of the density of states @xcite .",
    "hall measurements ( see methods ) showed only  3% changes in the fermi level after gas adsorption , indicating that doping alone is unlikely to account for the huge change in photoconductivity we observe .",
    "the opening of a @xmath44mev bandgap upon gas adsorption , and associated increase in the density of electron and hole states near the band extrema would be consistent with our observations . in this case , electrons injected into the conduction band by 800 nm ( 1.55ev ) photoexcitation would relax rapidly to near the band minimum via phonon mediated processes , as shown on the inset of figure [ pumpcomp ] .",
    "recombination for the photoinjected electrons across the bandgap with a sea of holes would lead to the observed stimulated emission signal .",
    "the spectral broadness ( @xmath42thz ) of the observed transition may then be explained by a combination of the following factors : a high interband transition rate ( lifetime broadening ) , fast dephasing via electron - electron interactions and a cooling bottleneck below the optical phonon energies .",
    "however full _ ab - inito _ calculations would be required to confirm the exact mechanism .",
    "note that since cvd graphene is heavily p - doped , the opening of a bandgap is not directly observable by terahertz transmission spectroscopy , as there are no electrons near the band gap to be excited by the low energy terahertz photons ( see supplementary discussion and inset of figure [ pumpcomp ] ) .",
    "the adsorption of molecules on graphene would locally open a bandgap and hence alter the otherwise linear density of states ( @xmath45 ) of the graphene , thereby increasing @xmath45 at the top of the valance band and bottom of the conduction band ( see inset of figure [ pumpcomp ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , a gap would only be opened in regions around adsorbed gas molecules , creating islands of semiconducting graphene amongst the unaltered , gapless graphene ( see supplementary methods for langmuir coverage calculations ) .",
    "as the terahertz probe is much larger than these puddles , the observed photoconductivity behaviour is the result of an interaction with of both types of graphene .",
    "increased stimulated emission will therefore be observed if gas molecules are more effectively adsorbed on the surface , thus creating a higher proportion of semiconducting material . of the gases used in this study ,",
    "o@xmath35 is most likely to interact with graphene @xcite , which is consistent with the increased negative photoconductivity signal observed in pure o@xmath35 compared with air and n@xmath35 .",
    "there are a number of other possible explanations for a lorentzian photoconductivity in graphene .",
    "a positive lorentzian conductivity may originate from the excitation of plasmons @xcite .",
    "terahertz surface plasmons have been predicted theoretically @xcite , and recently observed in spatially confined graphene @xcite .",
    "however , the peak frequency of a plasmon dependent conductivity varies with carrier concentration as @xmath46 @xcite and re(@xmath43 ) is expected to be positive , in contrast to our experiments .",
    "figure [ o2 ] demonstrates that our measured @xmath39 does not decrease with time after photoexcitation , and hence is independent of photoexcited carrier concentration .",
    "additional measurements showed @xmath39 to be independent of pump fluence ( see supplementary discussion ) .",
    "thus it is unlikely that excitation of plasmons explains the lorentzian response .",
    "a negative photoconductivity may also be attributed to a photo - induced reduction in conductivity , for example by an increase in the carrier  carrier or carrier  phonon ( intraband ) scattering rates .",
    "however it is not clear why such mechanisms would produce a lorentzian form , or occur only in gas adsorbed graphene .",
    "finally , ground - state bleaching could lead to a negative photoconductivity with lorentzian form , however the states associated with the absorption of ( 1.55ev ) optical photons in graphene are well separated from the states near the dirac point that are associated with interband terahertz absorption and emission ( see the inset of figure [ pumpcomp ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the opening of a small band gap in the presence of adsorbed gas molecules is the most likely explanation for our measurements .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in summary , we have used terahertz time domain spectroscopy to noninvasively probe photoexcited carrier dynamics in cvd grown graphene .",
    "we have observed that gas adsorption can dramatically alter the high frequency electrical response of graphene sheets .",
    "we also provide experimental evidence for stimulated emission of terahertz photons in graphene .",
    "furthermore our results demonstrate the huge influence environmental factors can exert on the behaviour of hot carriers in cvd graphene , and highlight the importance of consideration of such factors for future cvd graphene opto - electronic devices .",
    "large - area graphene films were prepared by chemical vapour deposition on 25@xmath15 m copper foil ( alfa aesar ) .",
    "prior to the growth , the copper foil was heated in hydrogen from room temperature to 1000@xmath47c for 60 minutes for removal of surface oxides .",
    "as temperature reached 1000@xmath47c , a mixed flow of h@xmath13 ( 15sccm ) and ch@xmath48 ( 60sccm ) was introduced for graphene growth .",
    "after cvd , the graphene film was separated from copper foil and then attached to the z - cut quartz substrate by the polymer transfer process : poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( microchem co. , nano pmma 950k a4 ) was spin - coated on graphene / copper foil to form a protective layer .",
    "the copper foil was etched at 25@xmath47c in ferric nitride solution ( 50g / l , j.t.baker acs reagent , 98% ) , leaving a transparent pmma / graphene film floating on the solution . after rinsing ,",
    "the film was transferred onto the quartz substrate , and the pmma capping layer was dissolved in acetone at 60@xmath47c overnight . in order to remove the residual pmma",
    ", graphene films were annealed at 450@xmath47c at 500torr in the mixed gases of h@xmath13 ( 20sccm ) and ar ( 80sccm ) for decomposition of the polymer .",
    "primary characterisation of the sample was performed by raman spectroscopy @xcite , using a nt - mdt confocal raman microscopic system ( laser wavelength 473 nm , power 0.5 - 1mw , spot size 0.5@xmath15 m ) .",
    "additional characterisation was performed using uv - visible absorption spectroscopy ( perkin - elmer lambda 9 uv - visible- nir spectrophotometer ) in the range 500 - 1300 nm , confirming the expected constant @xmath49 absorption of a single layer of graphene in this wavelength range @xcite .",
    "nominally identical samples were characterised using atomic force microscopy ( veeco dimension - icon ) and room temperature hall effect measurements based on the van der pawl method ( 3s co. , ni pxi-1033 ) . from the hall effect measurements averaged across 8 samples , the sheet resistance , carrier density and hall mobility",
    "were found to be @xmath50@xmath51 , @xmath52@xmath7 and @xmath53@xmath10/vs respectively .",
    "the characterizations show that the quality of the graphene samples is fairly good .",
    "further hall effect measurements were performed to examine the equilibrium electrical properties of the graphene samples under different gaseous environments .",
    "two systems were used for the measurements , one based on a permanent magnet ( 0.68 t ) , and another using a swept electromagnet ( 0  0.91 t ) .",
    "samples were held in a vacuum vessel , which could be purged with different gasses .",
    "the fermi levels were deduced using the relation @xmath54 , where @xmath55ms@xmath56 @xcite .    the equilibrium carrier density , and hence fermi level , were found to be relatively insensitive to the gaseous environment , with variations in @xmath57 and @xmath58 between samples being greater than changes induced by the gases .",
    "it was found that , compared with vacuum conditions , exposure to pure nitrogen gas decreased the carrier density by @xmath59 , exposure to oxygen increased the carrier density by @xmath60 and exposure to air increased it by @xmath61 , correspnding to fermi level changes of @xmath62 , @xmath61 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "these changes are consistent with previous observation of oxygen and nitrogen exposure doping cvd graphene p - type and n - type respectively @xcite .      a ti : sapphire regenerative amplifier ( spectraphysics spitfire pro ) was used as the pulse laser source for both terahertz generation and optical pumping of the sample : 800 nm , 45fs pulse duration , 5khz repetition rate , 4w average power .",
    "2.9w of this beam , reduced to 0.29w with an neutral density filter , was used to photoexcite the graphene sample , with a maximum fluence of 180@xmath15j/@xmath10 incident upon the sample , and beam width 2 mm .",
    "a fraction ( 200@xmath15j per pulse ) of the amplifier beam was used to generate the terahertz probe beam by optical rectification @xcite in a 2 mm gap crystal .",
    "the terahertz beam had a width of 0.48 mm at the sample position .",
    "the area of graphene probed by the terahertz beam was much smaller than the area photoexcited by the pump beam , thus the probe measured an area of roughly constant photoexcited carrier density .",
