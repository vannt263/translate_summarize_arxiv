    "we characterize the diameter @xmath5 property in orlicz - lorentz function and sequence spaces equipped with the luxemburg norm . a banach space x has the diameter @xmath5 property if every nonempty relatively weakly open subset of the unit ball @xmath6 has the diameter two . for the general overview on this property , we refer to @xcite .",
    "it is well known and easy to show that @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] have the diameter two property .",
    "it has been also shown that every infinite - dimensional uniform algebra @xcite , the set @xmath9 of all continuous functions from a hausdorff compact topological space @xmath10 to a banach space @xmath11 @xcite , and a symmetric tensor product of @xmath12 @xcite have this property .",
    "if a banach space has the radon - nikodm property its unit ball contains denting points and thus it contains slices of arbitrarily small diameters @xcite . therefore the radon - nikodm property can be considered as nearly opposite from the diameter @xmath5 property .",
    "the predual of james tree space @xmath13 does not have both the radon - nikodm property and the diameter @xmath5 property , and the latter is due to the point of continuity property @xcite .",
    "we recall that a banach space @xmath11 satisfies the daugavet property if , for every rank one operator @xmath14 and for the identity operator @xmath15 , @xmath16 holds .",
    "the daugavet property is stronger than diameter @xmath5 property , but as it is well known they are not equivalent .",
    "there are natural examples showing this phenomenon .",
    "for instance in @xcite it was proved that the classical interpolation spaces such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 equipped with their standard norms do not have the daugavet property but they do have the diameter @xmath5 property if equipped with the appropriate norm .",
    "similarly if an orlicz function @xmath0 does not satisfy appropriate @xmath4 condition then the orlicz space @xmath19 equipped with the luxemburg norm fails to have the daugavet property , but it has the diameter @xmath5 property @xcite .",
    "the investigation of diameter @xmath5 property in orlicz - lorentz spaces is inspired by this result .",
    "recent discovery of isometric description of the dual space of orlicz - lorentz spaces @xcite allows us to investigate a number of geometric properties of these spaces .",
    "we use this characterization here to consider the radon - nikodm and diameter @xmath5 property in orlicz - lorentz spaces @xmath2 equipped with the luxemburg norm . in fact , the kthe dual of the orlicz - lorentz space @xmath2 is the space @xmath20 equipped with the amemiya norm , where @xmath1 is a locally integrable weight function and @xmath21 is the legendre - fenchel conjugate to an orlicz function @xmath0 . for more details on the space @xmath22 and its application to orlicz - lorentz spaces , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the article consists of two main parts . in section 2 , we state and",

    "we also characterize the radon - nikodm property .",
    "in fact we show that if @xmath0 satisfies the appropriate condition @xmath4 then the spaces are dual and separable , and so they possess the radon - nikodm property which in turn implies that they have slices of arbitrarily small diameters . we also show that if @xmath0 does not satisfy an appropriate condition @xmath4 then the spaces have the diameter @xmath5 property and hence they can not have the radon - nikodm property .",
