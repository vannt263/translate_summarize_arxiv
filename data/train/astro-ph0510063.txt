    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars represent the final stages in the evolution of the most massive stars , whose surface abundances trace the products of h ( wn subtypes ) and he ( wc , wo subtypes ) burning .",
    "they possess fast , dense winds , such that their spectroscopic appearance is dominated by characteristic broad , emission lines , with photospheric lines absent . indeed ,",
    "narrow - band imaging surveys of nearby galaxies have identified wr stars primarily via their emission lines ( e.g. hadfield et al .",
    "2005 ) , which can also be seen in the integrated spectra of a subset of star forming galaxies , known as wr galaxies .",
    "spectroscopically , wr stars are classified by the ratio of adjacent ions of nitrogen ( wn ) , carbon ( wc ) or oxygen ( wo ) , with high ionization in early subtypes , and low ionization in late subtypes ( smith , shara & moffat 1996 ; crowther , de marco & barlow 1998 ) .",
    "wn stars are also commonly subdivided into strong / weak or narrow / broad emission line stars .",
    "observationally , earlier subtypes of both wn and wc stars dominate at low metallicities , a tendency which has been attributed to increased surface c+o abundances at lower metallicity for wc stars ( smith & maeder 1991 ) .    a metallicity dependence of the winds of massive o stars has long been established ( e.g. garmany & conti 1985 ; kudritzki , pauldrach & puls 1987 ) , such that the observed population of wr stars are known to vary with environment ( maeder & meynet 1994 ; massey & johnson 1998 ) . in the milky way , with high main sequence mass - loss , wr stars are relatively common with n(wr)/n(o)@xmath30.1 and n(wc)/n(wn)@xmath31 . in contrast , lower mass - loss prior to the wr phase in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) causes a dramatic reduction in both the number of wr stars , n(wr)/n(o)@xmath30.01 , and their subtype distribution , n(wc)/n(wn)@xmath30.1 .    up until recently",
    ", the winds of wr stars were assumed to be metallicity independent ( langer 1989 ) .",
    "however , both observational ( crowther et al . 2002 ) , and theoretical ( grfener & hamann 2005 ; vink & de koter 2005 ) studies have proposed a metallicity dependence , which have been incorporated into the latest evolutionary models ( meynet & maeder 2005 ) .",
    "observational evidence in favour of a metallicity dependence is presented in this review .",
    "the question of metallicity dependent winds in wr stars has received considerable interest of late , since they represent the prime candidates for long - duration , soft gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , following the collapsar or hypernova scenario ( woosley , eastman & schmidt 1999 ) .",
    "consequently , the circumstellar environment of low metallicity grbs is expected to differ substantially from those in metal - rich regions ( eldridge et al .",
    "prior to the development of non - lte model atmosphere codes , the wind characteristics of wr stars were derived from their free - free excess following the technique of wright & barlow ( 1975 ) via mid - ir or radio observations , revealing high mass - loss rates of a few 10@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "indeed , radio mass - loss rates should be reliable providing the chemical composition and degree of ionization are appropriate to the radio forming continuum .",
    "recent studies claiming reduced mass - loss rates for wc9 stars ( e.g. leitherer , chapman & koribalski 1997 ) are questioned by crowther , morris & smith ( 2006 ) who argue that helium is partially neutral in the outer stellar wind .",
    "terminal wind velocities , most reliably measured from uv p  cygni lines ( prinja , barlow & howarth 1990 ) range from @xmath61000 km / s for late wn and wc subtypes to @xmath73000 km / s for early wc stars or even higher for wo stars ( kingsburgh , barlow & storey 1995 ) .",
    "terminal velocities can alternatively be obtained from optical emission lines , providing the wind has reached its maximum flow rate in the line forming region .",
    "this is generally true for stars exhibiting strong emission lines , but not for weak emission line stars , such as the wn stars in the smc ( conti , garmany & massey 1989 ) .",
    "differences in wr subtype distributions in different host galaxies generally hinders efforts at establishing a metallicity dependence .",
    "fortunately , the presence of wo stars in a wide variety of environments , from the inner milky way ( e.g. sand 4 ) to ic1613 ( kingsburgh & barlow 1995 ) permits studies of similar stars spanning an order of magnitude in metallicity .",
    "[ velocity ] compares wind velocities of all known wo stars , and indeed suggests lower wind velocities at low metallicity , despite small number statistics .",
    "hydrogen abundances in wn stars may be derived from the pickering - balmer series ( conti , leep & perry 1983 ) and support severe h depletion , whilst high carbon abundances of c / he@xmath70.1 can be determined for early wc stars from recombination line theory ( smith & hummer 1988 ) .",
    "the development of non - lte model atmospheres by d.j .  hillier and w .- r .",
    "hamann and coworkers during the 1980s and 1990s has permitted great progress via the determination of physical and chemical properties by spectral line fitting , via diagnostic lines of he and/or n in wn stars and he and/or c in wc stars .",
    "the latest versions of these codes typically treat non - lte in a spherical , expanding , extended atmosphere considering the effects of metal line blanketing ( cmfgen : hillier & miller 1998 ; powr : grfener & hamann 2005 ) . historically , o stars were analysed using plane - parallel codes ( e.g. tlusty : hubeny & lanz 1995 ) , whilst current models ( e.g. fastwind , puls et al . 2005 ) now also account for winds and line blanketing .",
    "clumping is incorporated into these codes following an approximate manner via a volume filling factor , @xmath8 , such that identical recombination line profiles  scaling with the square of the density ",
    "result if @xmath9 is held constant .",
    "the primary diagnostics constraining clumping are the electron scattering wings , with a linear dependence upon density ( hillier 1991 ) .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry appears to be reasonable for the majority of wr stars , since spectropolarimetric studies indicate only 5 out of 29 wr stars show any persistent line effect ( harries , howarth & hillier 1998 ) .",
    "stars which do reveal significant equator - to - pole density ratios of 23 tend to possess strong winds and span late wn ( with hydrogen ) , early wn ( no hydrogen ) and wc subtypes .",
    "smith & willis ( 1983 ) compared the properties of large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) to milky way wr stars and concluded there was no significant differences between the two populations .",
    "these conclusions were supported by koesterke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and later hamann & koesterke ( 2000 ) from detailed non - lte modelling although a large scatter in mass - loss rates within each parent galaxy was revealed .",
    "one might conclude that there was no metallicity dependence , or that any differences are too subtle to be identified from the narrow metallicity range spanned by the milky way and lmc , given the multiple evolutionary channels available to stars entering the wn stage .",
    "crowther ( 2000 ) analysed the sole ( at that time ) single wn star in the smc , sk  41 ( wn6 ha ) .",
    "in comparison to lmc and galactic late - type wn counterparts , sk  41 was revealed to possess a low wind velocity and mass - loss rate .",
    "a larger sample of single low metallicity wn stars was needed for definitive conclusions regarding a metallicity dependence .",
    "this was provided by foellmi , moffat & guerrero ( 2003a ) who concluded that many smc wn stars which were hitherto considered to be binaries were apparently single .",
    "observationally , smc wn stars are well known to possess narrow , weak emission lines with respect to higher metallicity counterparts ( conti et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "the strength of heii @xmath104686 is related both to the wind density and ionization , whilst hei 1.083@xmath11 m is the primary wind density diagnostic in the optical / near - ir ( howarth & schmutz 1992 ) . in order to quantify the winds from weak - lined , single smc stars with respect to milky way and lmc counterparts we have obtained near - ir spectroscopy from ntt / sofi for 4 smc and 18 lmc wn36 stars from the samples of foellmi et al .",
    "( 2003ab ) in collaboration with c. foellmi and w. vacca .",
    "in addition , near - ir spectroscopy of 8 milky way wn36 stars at known distances have been obtained by w. vacca from irtf / spex .",
    "we present cmfgen results from our near - ir studies of wn stars in fig .",
    "[ nearir ] , where we have distinguished between stars containing surface hydrogen and those that do not .",
    "luminosities ( in @xmath12 ) range from 10@xmath13 to 10@xmath14 whilst mass - loss rates span 10@xmath15 to 10@xmath16 yr@xmath5 .",
    "it is apparent that the stars without hydrogen possess the strongest winds , with the exception of hd  192163 ( crowther & smith 1996 ) .",
    "the generic wn mass - loss luminosity relation of nugis & lamers ( 2000 ) for zero hydrogen content is indicated with exponent dm / dt @xmath17 , whilst a fit to our sample would suggest a softer dependence of dm / dt @xmath18 suggesting less extreme mass - loss rates at the highest luminosities .",
    "since the number of milky way and lmc stars with atmospheric hydrogen is fairly small , we have fit the combined sample ( excluding hd  192163 ) , suggesting a dependence of @xmath19 it is apparent that the smc stars possess even weaker winds . assuming a similar luminosity dependence",
    ", one would require a 0.4 dex offset for the smc stars ( 1/5 @xmath20 ) with respect to the milky way / lmc stars ( 1/2 to 1 @xmath20 ) , i.e. a metallicity dependence of dm / dt @xmath21 with @xmath22 . note that negligible hei emission was observed for two smc stars , such that an effective temperature of @xmath385kk was adopted on the basis of the observed optical nitrogen spectrum , with the mass - loss rate resulting from heii @xmath104686 emission .",
    "grfener et al . ( 1998 ) provided the first modern quantitative comparison between lmc and milky way wc stars , suggesting either a dependence of dm / dt @xmath23 for the combined sample , or a steeper dependence for the milky way wc58 stars with dm / dt @xmath24 with weaker winds for the lmc wc4 stars .",
    "comparisons at still lower metallicity are hindered because the sole carbon - sequence member of the smc is the wo binary sand  1 ( sk  188 ) .",
    "subsequently , crowther et al .",
    "( 2002 ) re - analysed the lmc wc4 sample of grfener et al .",
    "( 1998 ) based on line blanketed models together with an increased sample of milky way stars which has been analysed in the same manner .",
    "[ wc ] presents a comparison between the mass - loss rates and luminosities of milky way to lmc stars from crowther et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , including hd  164270 ( wc9 ) from crowther et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . the early wc milky way stars closely follow the nugis & lamers ( 2000 ) generic calibration , assuming c / he=0.2 and c / o=4 by number , whilst a fit to the lmc sample suggests a dependence of @xmath25 i.e. revealing a similar slope to nugis & lamers ( 2000 ) , albeit offset by 0.2 dex .",
    "consequently , results for wc stars close to solar metallicity suggest a @xmath26 dependence with dm / dt @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "empirically , the majority of wn stars in the milky way are late - type with n(wnl):n(wne)@xmath33:2 whilst those in the lmc and especially the smc are early - type , with n(wnl):n(wne)@xmath31:5 . within the milky way most late - type stars contain hydrogen and most early - type stars do not , which is no longer true in the magellanic clouds .",
    "there are two atmospheric factors contributing towards the earlier subtypes at lower metallicities , namely the fixed cno at a particular metallicity and the apparent decrease in wind strength with metallicity .",
    "cno compromises @xmath31.1% by mass of the solar photosphere ( asplund et al .",
    "2004 ) versus 0.48% in the lmc and 0.24% in the smc ( russell & dopita 1990 ) .",
    "since wn stars typically exhibit cno equilibrium abundances , there is a clearly maximum nitrogen content available within a particular environment .",
    "crowther ( 2000 ) demonstrated that for otherwise identical parameters , regardless of metallicity dependent mass - loss rates , a decreased nitrogen content at lower metallicity favours an earlier subtype , due to the strong abundance sensitivity of n iii @xmath10463441 and weak sensitivity of niv @xmath104058 .",
    "if wn winds do scale with metallicity , one also expects earlier subtypes since high wind densities at high metallicities will efficiently cool the wind through metal lines ( e.g. hillier 1989 ) , causing recombination from high ionization stages ( e.g. n@xmath29 ) to lower ions ( e.g. n@xmath30 ) close to the optical line formation region , which does not occur for low wind densities .",
    "consequently , both factors favour late subtypes at high metallicity , and early subtypes at low metallicity , as generally observed .    the observational trend towards earlier wc subtypes at lower metallicity , together with early recombination line studies of early wc stars , led smith & maeder ( 1991 ) to suggest that early wc stars are more carbon - rich than late wc stars .",
    "koesterke & hamann ( 1995 ) analysed a large sample of galactic wc58 stars , but did not confirm a subtype dependence .",
    "crowther et al .",
    "( 2002 ) supported the conclusions of koesterke & hamann , since the range of ( c+o)/he abundances in lmc wc4 stars were similar to those of milky way wc58 stars .",
    "crowther et al . ( 2002 ) argued that weaker winds for early wc subtypes was the prime reason for a trend towards early subtypes at low metallicities .",
    "indeed , their fig .",
    "12 illustrated that at fixed stellar parameters and chemical composition , a reduction in mass - loss rate by only a factor of two causes a wc7 star to become a wc4 subtype .",
    "the cause of this dramatic shift is due primarily to the sensitivity of the classification line ciii @xmath105696 to mass - loss .",
    "other ciii lines , such as ciii @xmath106740 , are relatively insensitive to such modest changes in wind density . if early wc stars dominate at low metallicity , as is the case for the lmc , smc and ic10 ( crowther et al .",
    "2003 ) , one would expect that late wc stars dominate at high metallicity .",
    "indeed , all 5 wr stars recently identified in the inner milky way by hopewell et al .",
    "( 2005 ) were of wc9 subtype .",
    "hadfield et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also found that wc89 subtypes dominate the wc population of the metal - rich spiral galaxy m  83 .",
    "to date , several studies have identified wn and wc stars in the very metal poor ( 1/50 @xmath20 ) galaxy izw  18 .",
    "izotov et al .",
    "estimated a total of 17 late wn stars plus 5 early wc stars , whilst wc populations were identified by legrand et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and brown et al .",
    "this galaxy lies at 1015mpc , so one has to infer individual properties from extrapolation of nearby , resolved wr populations .",
    "schmutz , leitherer & gruenwald ( 1992 ) stressed the importance of stellar wind density on the ionizing flux distributions of wr stars , such that emission at energies above the he@xmath31 edge ( @xmath32 ) relies upon the wr wind being relatively transparent .",
    "high metallicity , strong winds will generally produce strong optical emission lines , though negligible hard ionizing radiation , while low metallicity , weak winds will conversely produce weak optical emission lines and prodigious hard ionizing radiation ( smith , norris & crowther 2002 ) . therefore ,",
    "if low metallicity wr stars  such as those observed in izw  18  do possess weak winds , they would be expected to possess ( difficult to detect ) weak emission lines , faint optical continuua and hard extreme uv radiation .",

    ", a natural consequence of metallicity dependent wr winds would be that the number of unresolved wr stars at low metallicities are presently severely underestimated by application of calibrations appropriate to lmc / milky way wr stars ( schaerer & vacca 1998 ) . if high spatial resolution observations of wr stars in izw  18 reveal properties similar to milky way counterparts one would have to question their dependence on metallicity proposed here . finally , reduced wind strengths from wr stars at low metallicities impacts upon the immediate circumstellar environment of long duration grb afterglows , particularly since the host galaxies of high - redshift grbs tend to be metal - poor ( e.g. chen et al . 2005 ) .",

    "<S> a review of observational evidence in favour of a metallicity dependence of wn and wc stars is presented . </S>",

    "<S> a metallicity dependence is supported for wn stars with hydrogen , with @xmath0 with @xmath1 the influence of cno content upon wn subtypes is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> earlier wn spectral types are expected ( and observed ) at lower metallicity due to the abundance sensitivity of niii - iv classification diagnostics . </S>",
    "<S> recent physical and chemical results of wc stars in the milky way and lmc are discussed , suggesting a metallicity dependence of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> earlier wc spectral types are predicted ( and observed ) in lower metallicity galaxies , due to the dependence of the ciii classification diagnostic on wind density . </S>",
    "<S> wo stars reveal lower wind velocities at lower metallicity , whilst the situation for wn and wc stars is unclear . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the influence of a wr metallicity dependence upon the ionizing flux distributions and optical line luminosities is addressed , with particular regard to izw  18 . </S>",
    "<S> weaker winds at low metallicity would imply harder ionizing flux distributions and lower line luminosities , arguing for an substantially increased number of wr stars with respect to standard calibrations , exacerbating difficulties with single star evolutionary models at very low metallicity . </S>"
