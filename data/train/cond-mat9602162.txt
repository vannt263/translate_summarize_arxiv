    "the kosterlitz - thouless - berezinskii ( ktb ) transition @xcite plays an important role in the theory of ordering in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems which has a continuous symmetry specified by a phase .",
    "examples include planar magnets , 2d solids , josephson - junction arrays , and superfluid and superconductor films , etc.@xcite these systems have an ordered phase at low temperatures , characterized by power - law decay of correlations with distance .",
    "the ( quasi)long - range order is destroyed through unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs , which takes place at the ktb transition .",
    "a question of both theoretical and practical interest is whether and how quenched disorder alters the above picture . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the case of random frustration , where disorder introduces random , uncorrelated phase shifts but do not pin the phase angles themselves .",
    "more precisely , we shall consider an xy model with the following hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath4 where the sum runs over all nearest neighbor pairs on a square lattice .",
    "the quenched random variables @xmath5 , which give a random bias to the preferred advancing angle over each bond , are assumed to be uncorrelated from bond to bond , and each is gaussian distributed with the mean and variance given by @xmath6 respectively .",
    "it has been suggested that model ( [ hamil ] ) provides a good description of the josephson - junction arrays in a transverse magnetic field@xcite . in this case , @xmath7 is identified with the phase of the superconducting order parameter of grain @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the vector potential of the external magnetic field and @xmath11 is the superconducting flux quantum .",
    "the case ( [ a - corr ] ) corresponds to a situation where the average magnetic flux over each elementary plaquette of the grain network is an integer multiple of @xmath12 , but random displacement of superconducting grains from a perfect lattice structure yields quenched random phase shifts@xcite .    on the theoretical side , model ( [ hamil ] ) and its variants",
    "have been studied extensively in the past @xcite .",
    "result of previous studies can be summarized as follows .",
    "( i ) the spin - wave fluctuations have the same excitation spectrum as in the pure case .",
    "disorder introduces distortion in the ground state away from a perfect ferromagnetic alignment .",
    "the combined effect of thermal and disorder fluctuations leads to an algebraic decay of the two - point phase - phase correlation function , @xmath13\\bigr\\rangle \\sim r_{ij}^{-\\eta_{\\rm sw } } , \\label{2pt}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the distance between site @xmath8 and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the correlation length exponent at temperature @xmath17 , due to spin - waves only .",
    "( ii ) vortices , which are topological point defects in the @xmath18-field , interact with each other and with the quenched disorder through a coulomb potential .",
    "the interaction between two vortices is of the charge - charge type , where the charge of each vortex is given by its vorticity .",
    "the interaction between a vortex and a particular disordered bond is of the charge - dipole type , with the strength of the dipole given by the phase shift @xmath5 over the bond .",
    "the equilibrium statistics of vortices is decoupled from that of spin waves . for a long time",
    ", the phase diagram of the model was thought to be of the type illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a)@xcite . for @xmath19 ,",
    "a phase with bound vortex - antivortex pairs , and hence algebraic decay of phase correlations , still exists , but only in a temperature window @xmath20 .",
    "below @xmath21 , a `` re - entrant '' disordered phase was predicted .",
    "the two transition temperatures coincide at a critical strength of the disorder @xmath1 , above which the ordered phase disappears altogether .",
    "two recent papers , by nattermann , scheidl , korshunov and li ( nskl)@xcite , and by cha and fertig@xcite , cast doubt on the reentrance picture .",
    "the phase diagram they suggested is shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , where the reentrance line @xmath21 disappears .",
    "nskl@xcite further suggested that some sort of freezing phenomenon takes place below a certain temperature @xmath22 [ see the dashed line in fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , which preempts the reentrance transition at @xmath23 found previously .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to expand the pioneering ideas presented in refs . @xcite and @xcite to unfold the physics which underlies the vortex - antivortex unbinding transition in the presence of the quenched disorder .",
    "there are two main extensions contained in this work as detailed below .",
    "first , we analyze quantitatively the equilibrium behavior of a single vortex in a background of quenched random dipoles .",
    "analogy is made to two well - studied problems involving disorder : the random energy model@xcite , and a directed polymer on the cayley tree@xcite .",
    "it is shown that the single - vortex problem has a glass transition at a temperature @xmath24 below which entropy goes to zero , i.e. , the vortex becomes localized at the lowest energy site .",
    "the free energy of the vortex is proportional to the logarithm of system size at all temperatures , with a prefactor which vanishes on the phase boundary shown in fig .",
    "second , the dielectric and freezing properties of a dilute gas of vortex - antivortex pairs ( or molecules ) are examined in further detail , with particular emphasis on the spatial structure of equilibrium pair configurations . the freezing line @xmath25 in fig .",
    "1(b ) is shown to be related to the loss of entropy of a pair over an area where the pair can be considered as isolated from other pairs of comparable size .",
    "if we fix the center position of the pair , the two vortices make up the pair freeze at @xmath26 . in the ordered phase",
    ", @xmath27 due to the fact that the pair is allowed to explore an area much larger than its size and hence has a lower freezing temperature .",
    "interestingly , freezing of pairs is not associated with a singularity in the free energy of the system as a whole , and there is no real phase transition at @xmath28 .",
    "disorder also generates random , zero - field polarization of the gas of pairs , which enhances the effective disorder seen by vortices separated by a large distance .",
    "this effect , which has been previously overlooked , shifts the horizontal phase boundary @xmath29 in fig .",
    "1(b ) to smaller values of @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the outcome of these considerations can be turned into a set of renormalization group ( rg ) recursion relations which capture the _ average , large - distance _ properties of the system .",
    "apart from some minor differences , the rg flow equations derived in this paper are in agreement with those of ref.@xcite . to the extent that such a simplifying description offers a good approximation , a phase diagram of the form fig .",
    "1(b ) is produced .",
    "the rg description is however not sensitive enough to rare fluctuations .",
    "the influence of rare fluctuations on some of the quantitative aspects of our results , such as the slope of the phase boundary as @xmath17 tends to zero , remain to be studied .",
    "qualitatively , though , the basic conclusions of the rg calculation are expected to be valid , as the modification of the bare interactions due to excitation of large - size pairs is relatively small in the entire ordered phase shown in fig .",
    "an interesting question is whether the system in the low temperature region above the @xmath1-line has long - range glassy order .",
    "our calculation of the dielectric susceptibility of a gas of pairs indicates that screening is present at all temperatures , despite localization in the orientation of individual pairs below @xmath26 .",
    "this supports the idea that , in the disordered phase , vortex - vortex interaction at large distances is always short - ranged .",
    "consequently , long - range glassy order in the phase field is not expected at any nonzero temperature due to finite energy cost to excite an additional vortex in the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the coulomb gas representation of vortices of the xy model is briefly reviewed .",
    "a qualitative discussion of vortex - antivortex unbinding is presented to highlight the outstanding issues .",
    "the problem of a single vortex interacting with quenched random dipoles is analyzed in sec .",
    "connection is made to the random energy model and to a directed polymer on the cayley tree . in sec .",
    "iv we examine the behavior of a dilute gas of vortex - antivortex pairs of comparable size , under the influence of disorder .",
    "the calculation of the dielectric susceptibility and the zero - field polarization of such a gas is presented , as well as an analysis of fluctuations of pair density .",
    "a physical interpretation of the @xmath28 line is proposed .",
    "section v contains a derivation of the rg recursion relations and results that follow from these equations .",
    "a discussion of the phase diagram , singularity of the free energy , divergence of the correlation length , and the two - point phase - phase correlation function is presented .",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized in sec .",
    "some of the technical aspects of the study are relegated to the four appendices at the end .",
    "to set the stage , let us review briefly the steps leading to the coulomb gas representation of ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "the standard procedure is to take a continuum limit of ( [ hamil ] ) , which yields a quadratic hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath30 ^ 2 , \\label{quadr - h}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the lattice constant . the two components of * a * are given by the disorder @xmath5 on adjacent horizontal and vertical bonds , respectively .    in the presence of vortices ,",
    "the field @xmath32 is multi - valued .",
    "the vortex configuration is specified by a set of vortex charges @xmath33 such that the phase advance along a closed path surrounding site @xmath8 ( or rather cell @xmath8 ) is given by @xmath34 in a system with periodic boundary conditions , neutrality @xmath35 is satisfied .",
    "the gradient of the @xmath18 field can now be decomposed into a rotation - free part and a divergence - free part , @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents `` spin - wave '' fluctuations .",
    "the same procedure can be repeated for * a * , @xmath38 where the potential @xmath39 satisfies @xmath40    inserting eqs .",
    "( [ phi_dec ] ) and ( [ a_dec ] ) into ( [ quadr - h ] ) , we obtain ( apart from a constant ) @xmath41 , where the spin - wave part is given by @xmath42 and the vortex part given by @xmath43 ( see appendix  a for more details on the derivation . ) here and elsewhere @xmath44 is the displacement vector between sites @xmath8 and @xmath15 , and @xmath45 is the distance .",
    "in addition to the usual core energy @xmath46 , a vortex interacts with a quenched random dipole field @xmath47 through the potential @xmath48 from the above definition we have , in component form , @xmath49 note that @xmath50 vanishes when * a * is rotation - free .      at sufficiently high core energies ,",
    "at least , the gas of vortices in a charge - neutral system is expected to form one of the two phases described below .",
    "the first is a dielectric insulator , where @xmath51 charges bind to form pairs of charge - neutral molecules .",
    "this structure is low in the coulomb energy , but also low in entropy due to binding .",
    "the second is a plasma with a finite density of unpaired ( or free ) vortices .",
    "this structure is high in the coulomb energy but also high in entropy . in the absence of disorder , both the coulomb energy and entropy scale logarithmically with distance in two dimensions .",
    "a simple energy - entropy argument then predicts a finite temperature transition for the unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "this is also the temperature where the free energy of a single vortex goes to zero . an improved treatment , which takes into account reduction of the coulomb energy due to screening by other vortex - antivortex pairs , yields an exact description of the critical properties at the transition . in the plasma phase",
    ", there is complete screening of the coulomb potential , so that interaction between distant charges become short - ranged .    in the presence of",
    "quenched random dipoles , vortices may explore fluctuations in the disorder potential to lower their coulomb energy , and hence become more numerous .",
    "this speaks for the reduced stability of the insulating phase . on the other hand , in the process of gaining potential energy ,",
    "vortices become more localized , and this way loose entropy . the first insight one needs",
    "is how much energy a vortex can gain from the disorder by positioning itself at the right place .",
    "it turns out that this problem can be solved almost exactly , and the result again has logarithmic scaling with distance .",
    "the amplitude of energy gain from disorder is proportional to @xmath52 at low temperatures .",
    "thus , when entropy is not a factor , excitation of free vortices is not expected below a certain critical strength of the disorder .    as in the pure case , a complete treatment requires analysis of screening of the coulomb potential due to other pairs of vortices present in the system . at high temperatures ,",
    "a pair is able to explore a large number of different disorder environment , which minimizes the difference between quenched and annealed disorder .",
    "the situation becomes different at low temperatures where , as in the random energy model , the equilibrium behavior of a pair is dominated by the lowest energy configuration in the area accessible to the pair .",
    "a crucial issue is thus to obtain the correct statistics of the pair when spatial and angular localization becomes important .    with the above general picture in mind ,",
    "we are in a position to perform the necessary calculations .",
    "in this section , we examine the behavior of a single vortex , confined in a box of linear dimension @xmath53 . in the presence of disorder ,",
    "the energy of the vortex depends on its position @xmath8 , @xmath54 where @xmath50 is given by ( [ dipole ] ) with the sum restricted to sites in the box .",
    "the variance and spatial correlations of @xmath50 are given by @xmath55    a simplifying approximation to the single - vortex problem is obtained by setting the correlation of @xmath50 to zero .",
    "the resulting problem is known as the _ random energy model _ ( rem)@xcite .",
    "it turns out that , for quantities of interest to us , correlations in the disorder potential only introduce minor corrections to the rem results . in the following",
    "we shall first discuss the rem and then an improved representation .      in the rem",
    "one considers the partition function @xmath56 where @xmath57 , are a set of random energy levels drawn independently from a gaussian distribution , @xmath58 the model has been analyzed in great detail by derrida@xcite .",
    "below we quote some of his results relevant for our discussion , and refer the reader to his original paper for further details .",
    "( see also appendix  b. )    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath59 while fixing the ratio @xmath60 , the average free energy is extensive in @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the freezing temperature of the model . for @xmath65 ,",
    "the entropy is no longer extensive in @xmath61 .",
    "the above result can be applied to the single vortex problem by substituting @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . from ( [ rem - f ] )",
    ", we obtain the average free energy of the vortex , @xmath69 the corresponding freezing temperature is given by eq .",
    "( [ tg ] ) ( solid line in fig .",
    "2 ) . the coefficient of the logarithm changes sign across the dashed line shown in fig .",
    "2 , which is precisely the phase boundary in fig .",
    "1(b ) when renormalized values for @xmath70 and @xmath0 are used .",
    "( see discussion in sec .",
    "v. )    below @xmath26 , the entropy of the vortex is no longer extensive in @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that only one or a few lowest energy sites contribute significantly to the partition sum ( [ rem - partition ] ) in this regime ( see appendix  b ) . within the region bounded by the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 , the typical free energy of a vortex is positive , but there are rare realizations of disorder which give rise to a negative free energy .",
    "the probability for such events is a power - law function of @xmath72 with a negative exponent .",
    "this fact is important when we consider pair excitations in sec .",
    "the rem approach to the single - vortex problem is not completely satisfactory as it ignores spatial correlations in the energies @xmath50 .",
    "this correlation has a simple origin ( see fig .",
    "when we move the vortex from a site @xmath8 to a site @xmath15 , the change in the disorder potential is mainly due to a change in the local environment up to a distance of order @xmath14 , as contributions to @xmath50 and @xmath73 from quenched dipoles further away are nearly identical .",
    "this type of correlation can be easily coded using the cayley tree , where each site is associated with a path on the tree .",
    "the potential on a site is made equal to the energy of a path on the tree .",
    "geometrical proximity is translated into hierarchical proximity on the tree .",
    "this representation can be made explicit using the following construction , though details of it should be unimportant for our conclusions .",
    "for any chosen site @xmath8 , we divide the space into a set of rings of inner and outer radii @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , such that @xmath76 , while keeping @xmath77 constant .",
    "the potential at site @xmath8 can be written as a one - dimensional sum , @xmath78 , where each term in the sum contains only contributions from dipoles within a given ring , i.e. , @xmath79 we now identify the @xmath80th ring with the @xmath80th node ( branching point ) along the path @xmath8 on the tree , where @xmath80 increases from bottom to top .",
    "the energy of the node is given by @xmath81 .",
    "repeating the above procedure for a different site",
    "@xmath15 , we obtain another sequence of energies @xmath82 for nodes on the path @xmath15 .",
    "the two paths join on level @xmath83 .",
    "an intriguing fact about the random dipolar interaction is that the subsums constructed above are gaussian random variables with identical statistics , @xmath84 thus all rings contribute equally to the sum @xmath50 , independent of the radius of the ring .",
    "the cayley tree problem discussed above has been analyzed in detail by derrida and spohn@xcite .",
    "its properties are quite similar to the rem . in particular , the extensive part of the free energy is the same as in the rem , independent of the choice of @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , moments of the partition function have the same dependence on @xmath86 as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ z - n ] ) , and the transition temperature @xmath87 of the @xmath80-th moment is the same as in the rem .",
    "there are , however , differences in the amplitude of the ratio @xmath88 .",
    "this implies that the distribution of the free energy , @xmath89 , is not exactly given by eqs .",
    "( [ rho - min ] ) and ( [ rho - minapp ] ) for @xmath90 significantly less than @xmath91 , but the difference should be small , as otherwise the behavior of @xmath92 would be significantly different .",
    "as mentioned in sec .",
    "b , a quantitative study of the pair - unbinding transition must include a discussion of pair - excitations which modify the coulomb interaction at large distances .",
    "this is usually done by employing a real - space rg procedure , to be explained in detail in sec .  v. a crucial step in the rg scheme",
    "is the calculation of the dielectric susceptibility and zero - field polarization of a gas of pairs in a certain size range , say between @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this is the task to be carried out in this section .      to treat a dilute gas of pairs of uniform size @xmath93 ,",
    "it is useful to separate the `` internal '' degrees of freedom of a pair , given by allowed configurations of the pair confined to a box of linear size @xmath93 , from rigid translations of the pair over a distance greater than @xmath93 .",
    "one way of implementing the idea is to impose a lattice with a lattice constant @xmath93 .",
    "the lattice - gas representation is extremely handy owing to the following two properties of the system : ( i ) the disorder potential on a pair is essentially uncorrelated when the pair is translated over a distance larger than @xmath93 ; ( ii ) interaction between pairs of similar size in the dilute limit can be approximated by a hard - core potential extending over a distance of the pair size @xmath93 .",
    "these facts can be established following a similar line of reasoning as in the original paper by kosterlitz and thouless@xcite .",
    "let @xmath95 and @xmath96 be the coordinates of @xmath97 and @xmath98 charges in a pair , respectively .",
    "the pair energy is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the size of the pair .",
    "the rapid decay of correlations in the disorder potential @xmath101 on a pair beyond a distance of order @xmath93 comes from an observation made in sec .",
    "b. the two charges which make up a pair interact separately with quenched random dipoles within a distance of order @xmath93 from the pair center , but collectively as a dipole when more distant disorder is in question .",
    "hence the random part of @xmath102 is dominated by disorder within a distance of order @xmath93 from the pair center .",
    "( the remaining contribution from distant quenched random dipoles can be treated as a perturbation when necessary . ) on the other hand , barring contributions from distant quenched dipoles , @xmath103 is quite independent from @xmath104 for two reasons .",
    "first , each potential is dominated by quenched dipoles in the immediate vicinity of the site in question ( see discussion on the ring structure in sec .",
    "second , although the two charges are in the same disorder environment , when it comes to optimizing their ( free ) energies , they see opposite ends of the disorder energy distribution due to the difference in sign . therefore , to a good approximation , we can replace @xmath102 by the sum of two single vortex energies of the form ( [ s - eng ] ) , each containing a random potential generated by quenched dipoles within a box of linear size @xmath93 , independent from the other .",
    "the interaction between one pair and another is of the dipole - dipole form at large distances , which is small compared to @xmath102 and can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "the interaction becomes more complex when two pairs are at a distance @xmath105 , but it is generally repulsive , with a strength of order @xmath106 .",
    "( note that the two pairs should be arranged in such a way that it is not possible to regroup them to form @xmath51 pairs of smaller sizes . ) for simplicity , we shall replace the interaction by a hard - core potential of range @xmath93 . in the dilute limit ,",
    "the main effect of this interaction is to prevent more than one pair to take advantage of a particular favorable configuration ( and the ones very close to it ) , which turns out to be a very important constraint at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to define the lattice - gas representation .",
    "we divide the plane into a square lattice of cells , each of linear dimension @xmath93 .",
    "any given cell has at most one pair , and pairs in different cells do not interact with each other .",
    "the boltzmann weight on an occupied cell can be written as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the _ pair fugacity _ and @xmath109 is the configurational partition function of the pair attached to the cell .",
    "since there is no interaction between different cells , the partition function of the system factorizes into a product of cell partition functions @xmath110 .",
    "in addition , average over all cells can be replaced by an average over the disorder , as each cell represents an independent realization .",
    "to apply the lattice - gas description to the system of pairs in a given size range , say between @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we need to specify @xmath109 in more detail . for the discussion to be meaningful",
    ", @xmath111 should be small enough so that the pair fugacity @xmath112 can be regarded as a constant , but large enough so that individual charges in a pair are allowed to explore their own local disorder environment without been severely constrained by the specified range of pair size .",
