    "we have produced several batches of the solid h@xmath4-h@xmath4o compound in the c@xmath0 phase and recovered the samples at room pressure and liquid nitrogen temperature , by application of a standardized and reproducible procedure .",
    "the structure of some specimens has been examined by x - ray diffraction at the crist laboratory of the university of firenze .",
    "the sample examined presented a considerable texture , which prevented a rietvield analysis , but the measured diffraction pattern can be used to discriminate among several proposed structures .",
    "a le bail fit of the diffraction pattern is presented in fig .  2 , assuming the c@xmath0-ii structure , space group @xmath7 .",
    "lattice constant are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the other structures considered , namely st@xmath11 ( @xmath14 ) , ih - c@xmath0 ( @xmath15 ) @xcite and ice i@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , give diffraction patterns in evident disagreement with the experimental one .",
    "details of the synthesis procedure and of the x - rays measurements are given in the methods section .    by using our cryogenic raman apparatus @xcite",
    "we have measured spectra during different @xmath18 cycles , observing the crystal lattice excitations and the rotations of the h@xmath4 molecule ( 150 - 650 @xmath19 ) , the oh stretching mode of the water molecule ( 3000 - 3400 @xmath19 ) , and the vibron of the h@xmath4 molecule ( 4100 - 4200 @xmath19 ) .",
    "our raman spectra ( see fig .  3 ) and overall results add important information on the structure , which are consistent with only one of the proposed structures , namely the c@xmath0-ii one @xcite with space group @xmath7 depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "in this structure the water molecules form spiraling channels with a free bore hole along the @xmath20 axis of about 5.26   and with a diameter of 6.10  , which can accommodate the h@xmath4 molecules . observing the spectra ( fig .",
    "3a ) , we notice that the lattice phonon band ( black line ) has a broad smooth shape , showing similarities with the same band in both ice ih ( blue line ) and sii clathrates ( red line ) .",
    "the absence of sharp lines rules out the possibility that the water lattice in the c@xmath0 phase might be proton ordered .",
    "this is at variance with the c@xmath6 filled ice , which exhibits proton order and , consequently , a lattice phonon spectrum with evident sharp lines @xcite .",
    "the rotational spectrum of the hydrogen molecules ( fig .",
    "3c ) presents well distinct lines , proving that the h@xmath4 molecules rotate almost freely .",
    "the s@xmath0(0 ) rotational band is split in probably three components , with a larger splitting than in clathrate - hydrates .",
    "this is an indication of a more intense interaction of the hydrogen molecule with the environment and a larger perturbation of the rotational motion . according to the proposed structure ,",
    "the hydrogen molecules are arranged in the channels , probably in a spiraling configuration @xcite , at a distance from water oxygen atoms of about 3.1   and at about 2.95   between each other , the same as in solid hydrogen at about 1.5 gpa .",
    "the larger splitting of the rotational band components is accountable on the basis of the shortest distance between h@xmath4 and h@xmath4o molecules in the @xmath7 structure , and indirectly confirms it . in addition , at such a short distance the h@xmath4-h@xmath4 anisotropic interaction may sustain collective rotational excitations , as it happens in solid h@xmath4 @xcite and ar(h@xmath4)@xmath4 high pressure compound @xcite , which may contribute to the width of the rotational lines . the spectrum of the h@xmath4 vibron region ( fig .",
    "3d ) consists of only one doublet ( q@xmath6(0 ) and q@xmath6(1 ) lines ) , and this is in accordance with the occupation of a single crystallographic site for the hydrogen molecules , as in the proposed structure @xcite .",
    "the oh stretching band ( fig .",
    "3b ) has the main peak at 3123 @xmath19 , a frequency higher than that of both sii clathrate and ice ih .",
    "the oh vibrational frequency is known to decrease while decreasing the o - o distance in different ices .",
    "this is observed both as a function of the considered compound @xcite or , for the same structure , as a function of pressure , as reported for ice vii @xcite and c@xmath6 filled ice @xcite",
    ". the higher frequency of the oh stretching mode observed for the c@xmath0 filled ice is in accordance with the larger o - o distance in the structure @xmath7 ( @xmath21   ) than in sii clathrate ( @xmath22  ) and in ice ih ( @xmath23  ) .",
    "we derive the hydrogen molar fraction @xmath24 from the intensity ratio of the hydrogen rotational lines and the lattice phonon band , @xmath25 .",
    "this analysis is done thanks to the assumption , that sounds obvious , that the raman intensity of a band is proportional to the number of molecules giving rise to it .",
    "this is anyhow an approximation , since difference of the polarisability of the same molecules in different environments may lead to differences in intensity .",
    "this matter has been considered in sec .",
    "iiia of ref .",
    "@xcite , and we refer to that paper for a more thorough discussion .",
    "we calculate the calibration factor by fitting data arising from two independent experimental methods .",
    "a first set of data is obtained by using similar spectra of sii clathates , for which the hydrogen content is calculated by counting the number of molecules in the large and small cages @xcite .",
    "the spectra of these samples in the 200 - 900 @xmath19 range ( not reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are used to calculate @xmath25 .",
    "to these data we add the information we derive from new volumetric measurements performed on our c@xmath0 sample at three temperatures , namely 20 , 50 and 80 k. the procedure is explained in detail in the methods section .",
    "for the samples examined just after synthesis , whose typical spectra are represented in fig .  3",
    ", we obtain @xmath26% .",
    "we discover that the c@xmath0 structure is metastable at room pressure even when emptied , and is a new form of ice , namely ice xvii .",
    "the mechanical stability of the sample is tested by increasing the temperature while keeping the sample under dynamic vacuum .",
    "we then observe the gradual release of the hydrogen from the sample , up to the complete undetectability of the hydrogen rotational lines obtained after pumping for 1 - 2 hours at a temperature of about 120 k. considering the sensitivity and the signal to noise ratio of our detection system , we can ascertain that the h@xmath4/h@xmath4o molar fraction in the emptied sample is less then 0.5% . during the heating process",
    ", we do not observe any abrupt change of the lattice phonon and oh stretching bands , demonstrating that no structural phase transitions have occurred .",
    "decreasing again the temperature of ice xvii and comparing the spectra measured at the same low temperature we notice after the annealing an increase in the frequency of about 7 @xmath19 for the lattice phonon bands",
    "4a ) and a decrease of about 20 @xmath19 for the oh mode ( fig .",
    "this indicates a decrease of the average o - o distance . the same indication we obtain from the concurrent increase of the lattice modes , indicating a stronger binding .",
    "however , the overall similarity of the band shape before and after annealing leads us to believe that the structure of the filled c@xmath0 ice and that of ice xvii are essentially the same .",
    "the situation for the c@xmath0 structure is different from previous observation in sii , where upon cages emptying , the lattice constant , and consequently the o - o distance increases @xcite .",
    "the contraction of the water framework upon inclusion of ne in the cages of sii clathrate may be imputed to a attractive interaction between this atom and water .",
    "it is interesting to compare also with the situation of the he - hydrate , which become ice ii upon emptying @xcite . here",
    "the phenomenology is more complex , but the changes in the structure can be related to the mainly repulsive interaction between the he and o atoms .",
    "the precise nature of the effect of the annealing on the structure of the c@xmath0 samples is not clear yet .",
    "the increased sharpness of the spectral features measured after the annealing suggests the decrease of defects in the structure .",
    "we recall that recently some authors @xcite , in order to explain the non perfect refinement of the x - rays diffraction pattern with the @xmath7 structure , have hypothesized that some nitrogen molecules , instead of water molecules , may have been trapped in the channels during the recovering of the sample in liquid nitrogen",
    ". a possible effect of the annealing might be the removal of these nitrogen molecules . to check this hypothesis ,",
    "we have measured raman spectra of our samples , before and after this annealing process , in the region of the n@xmath4 stretching mode , observing , at 20 k before the annealing , a quite evident and sharp line at a frequency @xmath27 @xmath19 . by virtue of their vibration frequency ,",
    "sensibly lower than both that of n@xmath4 gas ( 2329.917 @xmath19 ) @xcite , and that of solid n@xmath4 in the @xmath10-phase ( a doublet at 2327.5 and 2328.5 @xmath19 ) @xcite , we can establish that the n@xmath4 molecules are trapped inside the structure .",
    "the raman line essentially disappears ( it becomes 1000 times weaker ) after the annealing process .",
    "the evident spectroscopic signatures of structural modification described above are a combined effects of the removal of both h@xmath4 and n@xmath4 from the sample .",
    "the unexpected property of ice xvii is that , when exposed to even a low pressure of hydrogen gas , it adsorbs the molecules up to an amount which is pressure dependent , but may grows larger than that initially present just after synthesis . as a matter of fact",
    ", we generally obtain @xmath28% for pristine samples , possibly because of the presence of adsorbed nitrogen in the channel and/or of the handling of the sample for the insertion of the raman apparatus .",
    "the adsorption process has initially a fast kinetics , even at 15 k. the rotational raman spectra measured at 40 k after subsequent partial refilling steps are shown in fig .",
    "maximum gas pressure is in this case only 250 mbar , but the rotational intensity grows higher than that in the pristine c@xmath0 sample .",
    "the shape of the rotational lines does not change significantly , demonstrating that h@xmath4 is penetrating again in the same positions in the channels as those initially occupied at the time of synthesis .",
    "normalizing the rotational raman intensity with respect to the lattice phonon band and applying the calculated conversion constant , we estimate the h@xmath4/h@xmath4o molar fraction .",
    "we notice that , in some instances , as for the most intense spectrum shown in fig  4c , the measured h@xmath4/h@xmath4o molar ratio in the sample exceeds 40 % , reaching higher values than the established theoretical maximum ( @xmath29 ) for sii hydrates .",
    "we have measured then several adsorption isotherms , deriving the amount of adsorbed h@xmath4 as a function of pressure , at several different temperatures between 15 to 80 k. results for four temperatures are presented in fig .",
    "pressure has been increased gradually ( squares in fig .",
    "5 ) and , when possible , measurements have been taken after the same delay @xmath30 from pressure increase , which is indicated in each figure .",
    "the pressure at which saturation is reached is strongly dependent on temperature and ranges between a few millibar at 15 k to several bar at 80 k. by measuring with the same method , we have also examined the gas desorption while releasing pressure .",
    "a large hysteresis and other kinetics effects are evident at the lower temperatures . at 15 k , after decreasing pressure down to zero , the sample does not sensibly release hydrogen in @xmath31 min .",
    "the same effect is observed at 40 k , the filling remaining almost constant for at least 36 min . at this temperature",
    ", the increase in the adsorbed gas observed at about 240 mbar , after a 16.5 hour long exposure to hydrogen , indicates that at least two time scales dominate the phenomenon : one fast adsorption in the outermost sites of the channels and a slower one , limited by molecular diffusion inside the channels . at higher temperatures , 65 and 80 k",
    ", we observe a very small hysteresis , indicating that the time needed to hydrogen to diffuse for distance of the order of the linear dimension of the sample grains is quite shorter than the time interval between measurements . at temperature above 50 k ,",
    "the desorption process is quick ( compared to sii clathrates ) .",
    "this is not surprising at all , since the channels in ice xvii are much wider than the free space inside both the 6-membered and 5-membered rings .",
    "from the isotherm hydrogen uptake as a function of the pressure presented in fig .",
    "5 , it is possible to estimate , by means of the van@xmath32 t hoff equation , the enthalpy of adsorption , @xmath33 , for a given hydrogen uptake @xmath24 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gas constant .",
    "@xcite for this calculation we use the data collected at 50 , 65 and 80 k , estimating the derivative with a straight line fit .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath36 decrease with increasing molar ratio @xmath24 starting from about 5 kj / mol at @xmath37 down to about 2 kj / mol at @xmath38 , in agreement with typical values for physisorption .",
    "this work is the first characterization of the dynamics of the c@xmath0 filled ice .",
    "moreover , two remarkable results arise from this study . first , we discovered that the c@xmath0 structure is stable when emptied . due to its large range of stability ( up to 130 k at least ) ,",
    "it should be counted as a new form of ice and named ice xvii .",
    "second , we found that ice xvii is capable to adsorb hydrogen gas in large quantities ( presumably , on the basis of its structure up to @xmath39 ) , without substantial change in its structure .",
    "we believe that , more than the maximum estimated hydrogen uptake , it is the fast reversibility of gas adsorption , the theoretically infinite number of possible cycles ( there is no chemical change of the substance involved ) and the relatively modest pressures at which the process occurs , at temperature close to that of liquid nitrogen , that make ice xvii really appealing for hydrogen storage applications .",
    "we have produced several instances of solid h@xmath4-h@xmath4o compound by application of a standardized procedure .",
    "the check of the recovered samples with raman scattering confirms that we have always obtained the sample in the same c@xmath0 phase . to synthesize the samples ,",
    "we introduce a few grams of finely ground ice into a beryllium - copper autoclave , and we expose the sample to hydrogen gas at a pressure in the range or above 430 mpa , at a temperature of about 255 k ( -18@xmath2c ) .",
    "we prudentially leave the sample under pressure for a few days , even though , while rising pressure during synthesis , we observe at about 360 mpa an abrupt decrease of the rate of pressure rise , which is a clear indication of large hydrogen adsorption by the ice . then we quench the autoclave in liquid nitrogen when still under pressure , and finally , after releasing the pressure , we recover the sample at liquid nitrogen temperature , in the form of a fine powder .",
    "the same procedure is applied for the synthesis of the samples to be investigated by x - rays diffraction , except that in this case a drop of water is frozen from the beginning inside a few common x - rays glass capillaries , each of them 10 - 15 mm long .",
    "the frozen water occupies a capillary length of about 1 mm .",
    "the capillaries are inserted in the autoclave where they undergo the same standardized procedure , and are then recovered and handled at liquid nitrogen temperature .    for raman measurements , a small amount of sample is inserted in our optical cell , in contact with the cold finger of a closed - cycle he cryostat @xcite .",
    "the transfer process has to be accomplished at almost liquid nitrogen temperature and in a dry - nitrogen atmosphere , exerting particular care to avoid sample heating .",
    "once the raman cell is filled with the sample , it is sealed with the optical window and purged with helium gas .",
    "the sample cell can then be set to any temperature between room temperature and @xmath40 k. gas pressure in the cell can be varied and measured with an accuracy of about 1 % .",
    "raman spectra are excited by means of an ar ion laser at 514.5 nm , with a power of about 30 mw on the sample , focused on a spot of about 30 @xmath41 m .",
    "scattered light is collected in an almost back - scattering geometry , focused on the entrance slit of a spex spectrograph , and recorded by a cooled ccd detector ( andor ) .",
    "the maximum resolution of the instrument is 0.4 @xmath19 .",
    "similar care has to be exerted to mount the capillary on the x - ray diffractometer ( four circle oxford diffraction xcaliburpx ) the capillary is maintained at low temperature ( about 90 - 100 k ) by a cold nitrogen blow provided by a oxford cryosteam system .",
    "diffractograms are collected using a copper x - ray source , and recorded by a 165 diameter ccd detector .",
    "total collection time is of the order of 7 minutes . during collection ,",
    "the capillary is turning rapidly .",
    "we measure the molar fraction of hydrogen molecules contained in the samples of filled ice by computing the ratio of the intensity of the s@xmath0(0 ) and s@xmath0(1 ) rotational lines , weighted by the inverse of the respective cross section with the intensity of the lattice phonon band . specifically ,",
    "if we indicate with @xmath42 and @xmath43 the raman cross section for the s@xmath0(0 ) and s@xmath0(1 ) rotational lines , and with @xmath44 and @xmath45 their intensity , respectively , the quantity @xmath46 is proportional to the number of h@xmath4 molecules in the lowest two @xmath47 and @xmath48 rotational states , that is , at low temperature , to the number of h@xmath4 molecules giving raman scattering . dividing @xmath49 by the intensity of the water lattice phonon band , @xmath50",
    ", we obtain a quantity which is independent of laser intensity and detector efficiency , and proportional to the h@xmath4/h@xmath4o molar ratio in the sample .",
    "this procedure needs a calibration , that we have accomplished fitting data obtained with two independent methods . for several samples of sii clathates studied in our laboratory ,",
    "the hydrogen content has been indirectly derived , by counting the molecules in the small and large cages @xcite , while the spectra of the same samples in the 200 - 900 @xmath19 range are in our records , even if not reported in ref .",
    "this allows us to draw some calibration points ( black squares ) in fig .",
    "we have performed additional volumetric measurements on our c@xmath0 sample while measuring , with raman scattering , the adsorption isotherms at three temperatures , namely 20 , 50 and 80 k. these results are reported as colored dots in fig .",
    "the estimated uncertainty on these experimental points depends critically on the precision of the different calibrated volumes , of the pressure transducer used and on the pressure of the measurement .",
    "the cumulative linear fit gives a calibration factor of @xmath51 , that is the value we have used in this work .",

    "<S> until recently it has been believed that caged guest molecules are essential for the stability of the crystal , so that the water skeleton would collapse without them , at least at positive pressure , while , at negative pressure , existing or hypothetical empty clathrate structures are actually believed to be the stable phase of solid water @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> recently , only two experimental studies @xcite have investigated the phase diagram of the h@xmath4-h@xmath4o compounds at intermediate pressures and have demonstrated the presence of a further stable phase , named c@xmath0 , at temperatures 100 - 270 k and pressures 360 - 700 mpa , that is intermediate between the stability region of the sii clathrate and c@xmath6 phase ( see fig .  1 ) . up to now , a definitive consensus on the structure of the c@xmath0 phase has not been reached . the structural model ( later referred to as c@xmath0-i ) originally proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( space group @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) after ex - situ x - ray diffraction measurements at room pressure and 80 k , assumes the presence of water molecules in sites @xmath9 with 0.5 occupancy . </S>",
    "<S> these water molecules would not present correct hydrogen bonds with the other molecules of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> strobel @xcite suggests two possible structures ( indicated as @xmath10-quartz and st@xmath11 ) after the analysis of x - ray diffraction collected from one sample pressurized in a diamond anvil cell . </S>",
    "<S> these models were later examined theoretically by smirnov and stegailov @xcite , who considered also a variant of the c@xmath0-i structure ( indicated by c@xmath0-ii ) , and suggested c@xmath0-ii and st@xmath11 both as viable candidates . actually , the @xmath10-quartz structure , with the proposed parameters @xcite gives rise to atypical , very short , o - o distances . </S>",
    "<S> after this , oganov and coworkers @xcite used dft - based structure searching to predict several phases of the h@xmath4-h@xmath4o mixture , but these searching methods are restricted in the number of atoms , so any large clathrate - sized unit cells can easily be missed . </S>"
