    "elliptic flow , @xmath0 , is one of the key observables of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite .",
    "its large magnitude suggests that the strongly - coupled system formed in these collisions behaves collectively as a fluid  @xcite .",
    "however , quantitative comparison between hydrodynamic calculations and experimental data is hindered by the poor knowledge of the early collision dynamics and of the transport properties of the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is essential to identify _ qualitative _ features predicted by hydrodynamics which can be tested against experimental data .    a crucial step in our understanding of collective motion has been the recognition that @xmath0 fluctuates event to event  @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow fluctuations are quantitatively probed by the cumulants  @xcite @xmath2 , with @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "one typically observes @xmath4 and almost degenerate values for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , corresponding to gaussian fluctuations of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a fine splitting ( at the percent level ) between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is however observed for most centralities  @xcite .",
    "this splitting is a signature of non - gaussian fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "non - gaussianity is in fact expected in hydrodynamics because @xmath0 is proportional to the corresponding spatial anisotropy ( denoted by @xmath8 ) of the initial density profile  @xcite , and the fluctuations of @xmath8 present generic non - gaussian properties  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we identify the main source of non - gaussian fluctuations with the skewness of elliptic flow fluctuations in the reaction plane .",
    "we compute the skewness in event - by - event hydrodynamics ( sec .",
    "[ s : hydro ] ) and compare it with the skewness of eccentricity fluctuations .",
    "we then show ( sec .  [",
    "s : expansion ] ) , by means of an expansion in powers of the fluctuations , that skewness is the leading contribution to the fine structure of higher - order cumulants .",
    "we compare experimental data with hydrodynamic calculations . in sec .",
    "[ s : gamma1 ] , we derive a general formula relating the standardized skewness to the first three cumulants , @xmath9 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in the flow picture  @xcite , particles are emitted independently in each collision with an azimuthal probability distribution @xmath10 that fluctuates event to event .",
    "we choose a coordinate frame where @xmath11 is the direction of the reaction plane .",
    "elliptic flow is defined as the second fourier coefficient of @xmath10 , which has cosine and sine components : @xmath12 elliptic flow is a two - dimensional vector , @xmath13 . using the standard terminology , we denote by @xmath0 the magnitude of @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "since the probability distribution @xmath10 fluctuates event to event , the projections @xmath16 and @xmath17 are fluctuating quantities . in hydrodynamics",
    ", these fluctuations result mainly from the fluctuations of the initial energy density profile and are due to the probabilistic nature of the positions of the nucleons within nuclei at the time of impact  @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is to a good approximation  @xcite proportional to the initial eccentricity @xmath18 , which is defined by  @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy density deposited in the transverse plane shortly after the collision , in a centered polar coordinate system .",
    "we model elliptic flow fluctuations by carrying out event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations of pb+pb collisions at 2.76  tev , with initial conditions given by the monte carlo glauber model  @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : histo ] displays the histograms of the distributions of @xmath17 ( a ) and @xmath16 ( b ) in the 50 - 55% centrality bin . we choose this rather peripheral centrality range as an illustration because elliptic flow is close to its maximum value  @xcite and presents large fluctuations .",
    "values of @xmath16 are positive for most events , corresponding to elliptic flow in the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 its mean value @xmath27 where angular brackets denote an average over events in a centrality class .",
    "note that @xmath26 is smaller than the mean elliptic flow @xmath28 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath17 is centered at @xmath29 because parity conservation and symmetry with respect to the reaction plane imply that the probability distribution of @xmath30 is symmetric under @xmath31 .",
    "the magnitude of the fluctuations is characterized by the variances of @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath32 for small fluctuations , the fluctuations of @xmath16 correspond to the fluctuations of the flow magnitude , while the fluctuations of @xmath17 correspond to the fluctuations of the flow angle .",

    "this increase results from two effects : first , @xmath43 vanishes by symmetry for central collisions and is typically proportional to @xmath26 ; second , it is a first - order correction to the central limit and is , therefore , inversely proportional to the square root of the system size  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : truegamma ] also displays the standardized skewness of the @xmath24 fluctuations , which , as we pointed out before , would be identical to that of the @xmath16 fluctuations if @xmath14 was exactly linearly proportional to @xmath38 .",

    "hence , the hydrodynamical evolution washes out part of the initial skewness .",
