    "the understanding of how a mott insulator with localized states becomes a metal as one gradually increases the carrier concentration remains one of the main challenges of condensed matter physics .",
    "this question may be intimately connected with the so - called nodal - antinodal dichotomy ( sharp quasiparticles in the nodal region versus broad , gapped antinodal `` quasiparticles '' ) observed by angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) on underdoped cuprate materials.@xcite tunnelling spectroscopy has also been used to probe states in different regions of momentum space by the help of fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( ft - sts).@xcite in particular , it has been argued that the apparent incoherent antinodal states have their origin in the emergence of charge ordered regions in the underdoped regime.@xcite    in the @xmath0-wave superconducting ( dsc ) state near optimal doping , quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) observed by ft - sts is dominated by peaks at well - defined wavevectors @xmath1 which agree well with those predicted by the so - called octet model.@xcite the contours of constant energy ( cce ) of the bogoliubov quasiparticle dispersion are generally shaped like curved ellipses (  bananas \" ) centered at the nodal points ; seven different nonzero wavevectors @xmath1 connect the tips of these bananas .",
    "the dispersion of the peaks at @xmath1 allows one to extract the shape of the underlying fermi surface@xcite as well as the momentum dependence of the superconducting energy gap.@xcite a quantitative understanding of the amplitude and width of the peaks , however , is not straightforward to obtain , and depends rather sensitively on the nature of the scattering medium .",
    "a point - like scatterer , for example , in an otherwise homogeneous dsc leads to a landscape of some spot - like and some arc - like dispersive features close to @xmath1 in the ft - sts images@xcite whereas experimental data appear mostly spot - like .",
    "furthermore , the weights of the various peaks calculated in simple theories differ from experiment",
    ". there have been several theoretical attempts to remedy this situation by including more realistic models for the disorder present in bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( bscco ) .",
    "in particular , as realized recently , it appears important to include the gap inhomogeneity arising from the dopant atoms.@xcite models have also included the extended coulomb potential arising in this material from partly screened bi@xmath4sr substitutional disorder and the oxygen dopant atoms.@xcite nevertheless , a complete quantitative description of the ft - sts patterns is still lacking in the superconducting state .",
    "ft - sts has also been used to probe the pseudogap state in the underdoped regime where non - dispersive ( bias - independent ) quasi - periodic conductance modulations has been identified both in bscco@xcite and ca@xmath5na@xmath6cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 ( na - ccoc).@xcite the origin of these peaks remains unknown at present but may be caused by short - range charge order , possibly connected to the existence of nested segments of the fermi surface near the antinodal regions of the brillouin zone.@xcite in bscco near optimal doping non - dispersive peaks have also been discussed in terms of pinned and disorder - induced charge order.@xcite in na - ccoc it has been proposed that phonons play a crucial role in stabilizing a @xmath0-wave charge density wave order,@xcite or a surface transition to a commensurate charge density wave state.@xcite at present , however , it remains controversial whether true charge ordering is required for describing the non - dispersive ldos modulations.@xcite    recently , new developments in the ft - sts technique allowed for further detailed exploration of the electronic properties of underdoped na - ccoc and bscco .",
    "for example , it was argued that tip - elevation errors can be avoided by studying the conductance - ratio @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the bias voltage and @xmath9 the conductance , and the detailed properties of the ldos modulations were investigated in this regime as well.@xcite it was found that irrespective of the doping level , an `` extinction line '' exists in momentum space , beyond which most of the dispersing ft - sts peaks ( @xmath10,@xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 ) disappear , to be replaced by a reduced set ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) of roughly non - dispersive peaks.@xcite this extinction line is doping independent and coincides at all doping levels with the antiferromagnetic ( af ) zone boundary [ lines joining the points @xmath16 and @xmath17 . at energies below the scale @xmath18 where the cce first touch the af zone boundary ,",
    "the ft - sts response is similar to the dispersing bogoliubov quasiparticles obeying the octet model . at energies above @xmath18 ,",
    "the response becomes highly spatially inhomogeneous and appears dominated by pseudogap excitations .    one popular picture of the nodal - antinodal dichotomy invokes intense scattering with momentum transfer near ( @xmath19 ) which broadens states near the antinodal points .",
    "the problem with this picture in the superconducting state , however , is that the phase space for scattering is smallest at precisely these points of momentum space because the @xmath0-wave gap is largest there .",
    "thus graser _ et al._@xcite calculated the spin fluctuation spectrum within an rpa - type formalism and used it to determine the lifetime of states near the node and antinode of a dsc phase .",
    "this same framework produces a good description of the resonant magnetic response near ( @xmath19 ) as measured by neutron scattering.@xcite nevertheless their results , which were consistent with earlier work on quasiparticle lifetimes,@xcite imply that inelastic scattering of the conventional itinerant spin - fluctuation type can not severely broaden quasiparticle states in the superconducting state with momenta near the antinodes .",
    "this is of course consistent with arpes experiments , which find broad but well - defined antinodal peaks in the superconducting state of bscco.@xcite    one aspect of the physics of some underdoped cuprate materials which is left out of the conventional spin - fluctuation scattering analysis is the possibility of additional order coexisting with the dsc state at low temperatures .",
    "static stripe order has been observed in several high-@xmath20 materials and appears especially pronounced near 1/8 doping;@xcite in the la@xmath5ba@xmath6cuo@xmath21 ( lbco ) system , for example , charge order appears around 50k and persists to lower temperatures , where it coexists with spin order.@xcite in addition , @xmath22sr has consistently reported so - called  cluster spin glass \" ( csg ) signatures of frozen magnetic order all over the underdoped cuprate phase diagram of la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath21 ( lsco ) and bscco,@xcite generally attributed to disorder present in signficant amounts due to the way in which these materials are doped . in both lsco and bscco",
    ", the nodal - antinodal dichotomy is also observed in arpes measurements.@xcite these observations suggest that quasiparticle scattering from short - range coexisting order might play an important role in explaining the extinction of the qpi peaks in the experiment by kohsaka _",
    "et al._@xcite    there is no complete consensus on the origin of these ordering phenomena .",
    "one general notion is that disorder can pin fluctuating order while still reflecting the intrinsic correlations of the pure system.@xcite whether the level of disorder present in these intrinsically disordered systems is too large to justify such an assumption is not clear .",
    "however , various concrete models of pinned fluctuating stripes have been proposed@xcite which resemble experiment in qualitative ways .",
    "an alternative starting point to understand the csg phase assumes that dopants nucleate droplets of staggered order , which then interfere constructively to create quasi - long - range order.@xcite    these studies are related to the important question of whether af correlations coexisting with preformed cooper pairs are adequate to explain the pseudogap phase , or whether other types of ordering phenomena occur instead , or in addition.@xcite models of a disordered af phase coexisting with @xmath0-wave pairs can reproduce a number of known experimental results : the magnetic correlations have been shown to protect the nodal quasiparticles;@xcite reproduce the fermi arcs and nodal - antinodal dichotomy;@xcite as well as the temperature dependence of the superfluid density@xcite and thermal conductivity.@xcite    although the coexisting order in these systems is short - range , we know from neutron measurements in underdoped lsco@xcite that correlation lengths can be quite long , of order 100 lattice spacings .",
    "it may therefore not be a bad starting point for the study of the effect of these correlations on qpi to assume a long - range ordered state . here",
    ", we propose a concrete model for this effect by assuming the presence of a long - range af state coexisting with superconductivity , and then investigating the consequences for the ldos modulations . even though the underdoped materials which exhibit magnetic ordering are characterized by incommensurate antiferromagnetism [ with incommensurate peaks away from @xmath23 , we assume @xmath24 ordering for simplicity .",
    "we focus on the origin of the extinction line , and not the high - energy ldos modulations which require more realistic disorder models , possibly including charge ordering . in order to clearly elucidate the role of the af order we consider for simplicity a single point - like scatterer .",
    "the results presented below should be important for understanding future ft - sts modelling using more realistic disorder configurations .",

    "thus in the realistic situation with short - range af order , some scattering from af modulations will occur , but still well - defined quasiparticle peaks should remain , as seen in arpes .",
    "this resolves an apparent paradox in the comparison of the two experimental techniques in their view of the antinodal quasiparticles .",
    "it is the localized qpi @xmath124-space structures due to these states which are destroyed , not the states themselves .",
    "we emphasize that the formalism presented in this paper is essentially identical for any competing order scenario with ordering wavevector near @xmath24 .",
    "we believe that the bulk of the experimental evidence support the identification of the competing phase with short - range incommensurate af order or quasistatic fluctuations from incipient order , as observed in @xmath22sr . we have therefore discussed the extinction of qpi above a critical energy in this context , but other explanations with a similar structure may be possible .",
    "in addition , we note that realistic simulations of the qpi patterns require a more sophisticated description of disorder than that adopted here .",
    "it is thought that the potential produced by a single defect has components in at least the screened coulomb and pairing channels , and some account of the latter is known to be necessary to reproduce the correlations between dopant position and gap size observed in the bscco system.@xcite we have neglected these details here , but they are discussed e.g. in ref . .",
    "nevertheless , the patterns produced by our single potential scatterer were found to be sufficient to describe the basic phenomenology of kohsaka _",
    "et al._@xcite for the octet @xmath125 peak",
    ". it will be interesting to see if more sophisticated simulations can also reproduce the behavior of the other octet vectors and their weights correctly .",
    "one aspect of the current picture which remains unclear is the extent to which static order is required .",
    "the qpi extinction phenomenon observed by kohsaka _",
    "et al._@xcite is observed in bscco samples with doping levels 6 - 19% , i.e. including optimal doping where recent neutron experiments have claimed a 32 mev spin gap.@xcite still , near ( @xmath19 ) , some intensity remains below this energy , and @xmath22sr continues to indicate frozen magnetic order even in these samples at low temperatures.@xcite it may be that the magnetism in this system is simply too disordered to be seen by current neutron experiments .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment of short - range order is required to address these questions .",
