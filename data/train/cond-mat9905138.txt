    "the hamiltonian of the ising ferromagnet is given by @xmath0 where the ising spin at site @xmath1 , @xmath2 , can take either 1 or -1 and the sum is over all the nearest neighbors of the lattice .",
    "it is well known that the critical behavior of the d dimensional ising model can be described by the d dimensional euclidean scalar field theory the hamiltonian of which is given by @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the bare mass and coupling constant defined in the absence of critical fluctuations of the fields .",
    "near the criticality @xmath4 is a linear measure of temperature , and we denote by @xmath6 the value for which the theory becomes critical .",
    "as the fluctuations become strong renormalizations of the mass , coupling constant and fields are necessary , and the long distance behavior is no longer described by the bare potential but by the effective potential which is generally of more complicated functional form than the bare one . in statistical physics",
    "the effective potential represents the free energy density as a function of order parameter ( expectation value of the renormalized field ) , and is used to determine the equation of state .    after small - renormalized - field expansion of the effective potential , its coefficients",
    "are directly related to the renormalized coupling constants ( rccs ) defined at zero - momentum . in terms of the expectation value of the renormalized field , @xmath7 , the effective potential in the 3d symmetric phase",
    "may be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent respectively the renormalized mass ( inverse correlation length @xmath11 ) and the ( dimensionless ) @xmath12-point rcc defined at zero momentum .",
    "the formal expression of @xmath10 can be obtained by calculating the @xmath13th derivative of the effective potential with respect to the average value of the renormalized field .",
    "necessary elements for the calculations are the well - known relations @xmath14",

    "@xmath25 is dimensionless , so that the expressions of the @xmath26 are given by the above equations with additional division of the @xmath27 term .",
    "each rcc has a universal zon - zero finite value as the theory becomes critical , provided the hyperscaling relation holds . to be more specific",
    ", we take thermodynamic limit first and then take the limit of the thermodynamic correlation length becoming divergent ( that is , the limit @xmath28 ) . the corresponding value in this limit may be called as critical rcc . the determination of the accurate value of the critical four - point rcc ( @xmath29 ) is particularly important since all other universal quantities can be given in terms of it . in this work",
    "we are mainly concerned with the monte carlo calculation of the critical rccs in the symmetric phase of the three dimensional ( 3d ) ising model .",
    "( from here on the notation of rcc will be used without the subscript @xmath30 when it is used in context of size dependence . )",
    "this has been a subject of many studies , including a variety of quantum field theoretic approachs@xcite , high temperature series expansions@xcite , exact renormalization group flow techniques@xcite , and monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "it is known that standard direct monte carlo measurements of the thermodynamic critical rccs suffer from enormous statistical noise@xcite .",
    "other monte carlo study is based on the finding of the probability distribution of the order parameter in the external field at various temperatures@xcite .",
    "we employ a novel finite size scaling ( fss ) technique@xcite combined with single cluster flipping monte carlo algorithm@xcite .",
    "our preliminary results were reported in ref .",
    "here we report the result of our updated monte carlo measurements that has been increased more than one magnitude of order .",
    "we also report our results measured at criticality that is useful to determine the correction to scaling in the rccs as well as results in the 2d system .",
    "for the calculations of the rcc one needs to calculate @xmath11 , @xmath22 , and @xmath31 . with periodic boundary condition imposed on the lattice , @xmath22 and @xmath31 can be expressed in terms of the expectation values of various powers of the sum of the spin over all the lattice site @xmath32 .",
    "for example , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the linear size of the lattice .",
    "@xmath11 can be very accurately determined using the standard second moment formula@xcite .",
    "the cluster algorithms@xcite of the monte carlo simulation have been extremely efficient for many problems of critical phenomena .",
    "it is now an easy task to obtain monte carlo data of typical physical quantities such as @xmath22 and @xmath11 with relative statistical errors less than 0.1 percent at a temperature arbitrarily close to criticality .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that accurate monte carlo measurement of higher order rcc is problematic in some cases .",
    "the problem stems basically from the fact that the higher order rcc is given as a multiplication of a huge number with a tiny one .",
    "the former is given typically by some power of @xmath35 , for instance @xmath36 for the @xmath37 of the 3d system , and the latter comes from the combination of the @xmath31 that turns out to be extremely sensitive to statistical noises .",
    "the noises increase rapidly with increasing temperature and increasing value of @xmath38 .",
    "to illustrate we measured various physical quantities at an arbitrary ( inverse ) temperature in the scaling regime of the 2d ising model with increasing linear size of the lattice l. table([tab:2d_420 ] ) clearly shows that the statistical error in the measured values of @xmath26 increases with @xmath12 for any given value of l. for l=80 , for example , the relative statistical errors of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 are respectively 0.08 , 0.1 , 0.7 , 3.1 , 5.3 percents .",
    "we observe clearly that all the variables except for @xmath44 are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath34 , up to l=80 where @xmath45 . for further increasing @xmath34",
    "the values do not vary within the statistical errors .",
    "we recall that the well - known exact thermodynamic value of the @xmath11 at this @xmath46 is 11.9055 ... , which manifests itself at l=80 already within the statistical errors .",
    "the size independent value thus corresponds to the thermodynamic value .",
    "it is also very clear that the size dependence becomes rapidly weaker with increasing @xmath34 for all the variables we consider here .",
    "this is expected to be the case for any physical variable having well - defined thermodynamic value . for the @xmath43 , however , due to the large statistical noises is it hard to draw a definite conclusion on the size dependence .",
    "nevertheless , it is very natural to expect that @xmath44 would follow similar size dependence as @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    to compute the critical rcc it is required to obtain thermodynamic values as @xmath49 . for the case of the 2d ising model",
    ", we will not follow that procedure . instead",
    ", we will report the results of measurements at criticality and try to find out possible effect of the correction to scaling .",
    "the illustration in the case of the 2d ising model will be useful in connection with the study of the 3d case .",
    "note that the relation in the scaling regime @xmath50 translates into @xmath51 at criticality .",
    "hence the hyperscaling relation @xmath52 implies the invariance of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "conversely , from the ( weak ) dependence of of @xmath53 can one infer the correction to scaling in the scaling regime .",
    "computing rcc by taking the limit @xmath54 first and then take the limit @xmath55 is equivalent to the computation of @xmath53 .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath53 basically represents the apposite of thermodynamic limit for a non - zero @xmath56 ( that is @xmath57 limit for @xmath11 becomes huge but not infinite ) and has nothing to do with the lower - bound of critical rcc@xcite .",
    "we also report so called 6-th and 8-th order cumulant ratios at criticality that are denoted by @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "these are part of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and have already been available for the 2d ising medel based on umbrella sampling method of the monte carlo simulation@xcite . since our code is generic in dimension , the comparison with the result from different monte carlo method for these higher order cumulant ratios having severe statistical noises may be useful to check against any unexpected possible systematic errors in our monte carlo measurements .",
    "for example , @xmath59 is expressed by @xmath62 the results are summerized in table([tab:2d_fss ] ) .",
    "our results of @xmath63 for n=2,3 , and 4 are respectively 1.8318(5 ) , 13.93(1 ) , and -226.0(1 ) , which may be compared with 1.834 , 13.96 , and -226.6 reported in ref .. currently accepted value of @xmath64 is 1.832(1 ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath65 has no @xmath34 dependence at least for @xmath66 , confirming the hyperscaling and no significant correction to scaling .",
    "we therefore lead to the conclusion that the thermodynamic values of rcc measured at @xmath67 may well be regarded as the critical values .    regarding size dependence we observe similar feature in the 3d ising model as in the 2d case .",
    "our data are summerized in table([tab:3d_217 ] ) . for the @xmath68 and",
    "0.220 we observe no size dependence ( within the statistical errors ) for the @xmath11 and @xmath22 beyond l=32 and 60 respectively .",
    "this roughly corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "we expect that this is the case even for the rccs , although it was almost impossible to get precise measurements of the thermodynamic values of @xmath48 and @xmath44 for this value of @xmath38 .",
    "for example , for @xmath68 and @xmath70 we generated about @xmath71 single cluster sweeps , but error bars are larger than the mean value for the @xmath44 .",
    "the values of @xmath48 for @xmath72 also seem to be unreliable in view of the generic feature of the weaker size dependence with larger @xmath34 .",
    "it thus appears that monte carlo computation of the critical rccs relying on direct brute force measurements is prohibitively difficult . in order to overcome the difficulty closer to @xmath73 ,",
    "we make use of a new fss function @xmath74@xcite , defined by the expression @xmath75 here @xmath76 represents the quantity @xmath77 measured on a finite lattice of linear size @xmath34 at a reduced temperature @xmath78 , with its corresponding thermodynamic value @xmath79 . what eq.([eq : fun ] ) states is that the size dependence of a physical quantity @xmath77 is given as a function of the scaling variable @xmath80 . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath34 to @xmath39 beyond which thermodynamic limit is reached is independent of the temperature , that turned out to be approximately 5.5 for the 3d ising model .",
    "the fss technique is especially useful for our purpose , because it enables us to extract accurate thermodynamic values based on the monte carlo measurements with much smaller lattices .",
    "we just outline the single step fss extrapolation technique used in this work . for a detailed explanation ,",
    "we refer the readers to ref ..    1 .   for a certain @xmath81 , measure @xmath82 and @xmath83 for increasing l. 2 .",
    "determine the thermodynamic value at the temperature @xmath84 by measuring @xmath85 which is @xmath34 independent .",
    "fit @xmath86 data to a suitable functional form . in this work we used the ansatz ,",
    "@xmath87 4 .   for",
    "any other @xmath78 , choose a suitable l , measure the value of @xmath88 and @xmath76 , and interpolate @xmath89 .",
    "extract @xmath79 by plugging @xmath76 and @xmath89 into eq.([eq : fun ] ) .",
    "the smallest value of l we considered for the fss method is 20 .",
    "our choice of @xmath90 is @xmath91 .",
    "we infer from the generic feature of the size dependence observed for the 3d ising model that thermodynamic limit of the rccs are reached for @xmath92 .",
    "we thus get @xmath93 and @xmath94 at this @xmath46 . fitting the data to the ansatz eq.([eq : ans ] ) , we get @xmath95 for the scaling function @xmath96 of @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively . using the scaling function we calculated the thermodynamic values of the 4-point and 6-point rccs for all the l from 36 to 80 in the table([tab:3d_221 ] ) .",
    "the result at each l is in reasonably good agreement .",
    "for example , we get @xmath99= 24.3(1 ) , 24.4(4 ) , 24.1(1 ) , 23.9(1 ) , 23.9(1 ) , 24.1(3 ) , and 23.9(2 ) for each @xmath34 from the l=36 through the l=80 in the table . for @xmath100",
    "we get 1919(11 ) , 1939(20 ) , 1939(21 ) , 1915(10 ) , 1906(17 ) , 1917(70 ) , and 1897(49 ) .",
    "the invariance of the thermodynamic rcc with respect to the choice of @xmath34 is a numerical proof of the fss for the variables ( see figure([fig : g4 ] ) and ( [ fig : g6 ] ) ) .",
    "we usually extracted the thermodynamic value for several different choices of @xmath34 for a given temperature , and took the average .",
    "our net results from @xmath68 to @xmath101 are found in table([tab : net ] ) .",
    "it is observed that both @xmath99 and @xmath100 tend to decrease mildly as @xmath49 . in this work",
    "we assume the widely accepted correction to scaling exponent @xmath102 and @xmath103@xcite . by fitting our data in table([tab : net ] ) to @xmath104 we obtain the critical rcc which reads @xmath105    our results of @xmath65 are found in table([tab:3d_fss ] ) .",
    "it is observed that both of @xmath106 and @xmath107 have tendency of very mild decreasing with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "all the @xmath65 show remarkable invariance with respect to increasing l at least for @xmath108 .",
    "in other words , they do not show the effect of correction to scaling observed in the scaling regime .",
    "there may be a few possible interpretations for the discrepancy .",
    "first let us remind that eq.([eq : theta ] ) translates into @xmath109 and that the coefficient @xmath110 may happen to be very small .",
    "the second possibility is that currently accepted @xmath111 might be slightly underestimated : at exact criticality it is expected that @xmath112 remains an exact constant irrespective of the presence of the correction , which seems not to be the case at @xmath113 .",
    "it is impossible to apply the fss method for the @xmath115 due to its large error bars .",
    "nevertheless , it is highly likely that at least @xmath116 is of order @xmath117 .",
    "( see table([tab:3d_217 ] ) . )",
    "also we have reliable data at @xmath101 showing @xmath118 already for @xmath119 .",
    "furthermore it is observed that the ratio of critical rccs to @xmath65 tends to increase with @xmath12 ; the ratio is roughly 4.4 and 12.2 for n=2 and 3 respectively for the 3d .",
    "we also note that @xmath34 dependence of @xmath120 is quanitatively the same as that of the other rccs , indicating that the correction to scaling for @xmath121 is as mild as the other rccs .",
    "all the evidence almost undoubtedly point out that the critical @xmath115 is much larger than those estimated by other methods .",
    "our crude estimate of @xmath116 reads @xmath122    our value of @xmath123 is in reasonable agreement with other estimates .",
    "the agreement is especially good with the result from high - temperature expansion@xcite and the field theoretic treatment@xcite .",
    "however , the agreement becomes worse as @xmath12 increases : the results of @xmath124 from previous studies are within the range @xmath125 .",
    "the closest result to ours , @xmath126 , obtained from the previous monte carlo method@xcite is remarkable because it is obtained not by the measurement of rcc but by the monte carlo measurement of the probability distribution of order parameter assuming the thermodynamic limit for @xmath127 .",
    "we conjecture that this result would agree much better with our estimate if the same thermodynamic limit as in this work would have been taken .",
    "the values of @xmath116 from previous studies ranges from @xmath128 to @xmath129 , which is at least four times smaller than our estimate .",
    "although it was pointed out@xcite that longer series terms are necessary for more accurate estimate of higher order critical rcc from the high temperature series expansion method , it remains mysterious why previous studies based on different methods give rise to reasonably consistent results among them .",
    "nevertheless , in view of limitations of almost all the methods used to study this subject , it is fair to say that the issue is still open to further studies .",
    "our results of the critical rccs for 2d ising model obtained assuming negligibly small correction to scaling read @xmath130 the only result on the high order rccs we are aware of is the @xmath131 expansion study@xcite ; @xmath132 which agree reasonably well with ours .",
