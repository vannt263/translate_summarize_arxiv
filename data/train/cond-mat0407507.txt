    "the electron - phonon coupling for high-@xmath3 cuprates has recently attracted much interest .",
    "et al._@xcite discovered strong coupling to a mode at 70 mev in many cuprates .",
    "the coupling was ascribed to a half - breathing phonon along the ( 1,0,0 ) direction .",
    "this is an in - plane bond - stretching mode , where the vibrations are primarily due to two of the four o atoms surrounding a cu atom in the cuo@xmath4 plane .",
    "et al._@xcite deduced a rather strong apparent electron - phonon coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the half - breathing phonon shows an anomalous softening when the cuprates are doped , in particular towards the zone boundary.@xcite the softening of other phonons upon doping can be explained as a screening of the ions in the doped system.@xcite the softening of the half - breathing mode , however , can not be described in a shell model with conventional parameters.@xcite this supports the idea that this phonon has substantial electron - phonon coupling , which would lead to a reduction of the frequency in the doped but not in the undoped system .",

    "in particular , the frequency of the half - breathing mode along the ( 1,0,0 ) direction was found to be anomalously soft , in agreement with experiment . since lda",
    "does not describe antiferromagnetism in the undoped system , however , it can not properly describe phonons in the undoped case .",
    "it is therefore not clear how much the phonon is softened under doping in the lda .",
    "furthermore , lda calculations show a weak electron - phonon coupling to the half - breathing phonon , with @xmath9 at the zone boundary being @xmath10 0.01.@xcite this is in disagreement with the large width of the half - breathing phonon , which is believed to be due to a rather strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the weak coupling raises questions about the reason for the low frequency of the half - breathing phonon in the lda calculation for the doped system .    to address these issues , we here study the three - band model,@xcite including a cu @xmath11 and two o @xmath12-orbitals per unit cell .",
    "we allow displacements of the atoms from their equilibrium positions and take the corresponding changes of hopping integrals into account . in this model",
    "we can study phonons .",
    "we solve the model using a hartree - fock ( hf ) mean - field approximation , which may be expected to simulate features of the lda for the doped system .",
    "for instance , we find a similar width for the half - breathing phonon as in the lda .",
    "in contrast to lda , however , this approximation gives an antiferromagnetic solution for the undoped system .",
    "we can therefore obtain the softening upon doping within this framework .",
    "the softening of the half - breathing phonon is indeed found to be of the same order of magnitude as the experimental result , supporting the idea that the lda can describe the softening .    alternatively , a @xmath0-@xmath1 model with phonons can be derived from the three - band model .",

    "we study the three - band model with @xmath17 unit cells @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the occupation numbers for the @xmath17 @xmath21-orbitals and the @xmath22 @xmath23orbitals , respectively , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the corresponding annihilation operators .",
    "the site energies are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "there is a coulomb integral @xmath28 , acting between two @xmath21-electrons on the same cu site .",
    "the model includes hopping between nearest neighbor cu and o atoms and between the o atoms which are nearest neighbors of a particular cu atom.@xcite these hopping integrals are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , with the signs determined by the relative orientations of the orbitals involved . displacing an atom leads to changes of both electrostatic potentials and hopping integrals .",
    "electrostatic potentials are screened differently in the doped and undoped systems .",
    "it was found , however , that the change of screening does not strongly influence the half - breathing phonon.@xcite we therefore assume here that the changes of hopping integrals are the dominating effects.@xcite    we assume the hopping integral @xmath29 has a power dependence on the atomic separation @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the lattice parameter .",

    "we use a frozen phonon method to calculate the phonon frequency in the hf approximation for the three - band model .",
    "this gives the effective hamiltonian @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the expectation value of @xmath50 .",
    "we also introduce the effective level @xmath51    a static distortion is built into the lattice and the change of the total energy is calculated . from this the interaction with the electrons",
    "can be deduced and the softening of the phonon obtained .",

    "the energy of the electronic system is then @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the density matrix , obtained in some approximation , e.g. the hf approximation . using the hellmann - feynman theorem , it follows that @xmath55 from the total energy calculation , we can deduce both @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath37=1 , 2 .",
    "@xmath58 describes how a first order change in the external hamiltonian leads to a first order change in the density matrix , which acts back at the hamiltonian .",

    "we can obtain not only a contribution to the energy but also the width of the phonon .",

    "the doping was chosen in such a way that degenerate levels were either completely full or completely empty , i.e. , all `` shells '' were either full or empty .",
    "we first consider the half - breathing phonon for @xmath76 , where the two o atoms at ( @xmath33/2,0 ) and move towards ( or away from ) from the cu atom at ( 0,0 ) .",
    "we perform a calculation for the undoped system , having five electrons per unit cell , and allowing for spin - polarization .",

    "the result as a function of the hole doping @xmath14 ( @xmath77 means electron doping ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the doping dependence is relatively weak .",
    "since the undoped system is antiferromagnetic but the doped system is ( assumed to be ) paramagnetic , as found experimentally , the softening is not necessarily small for small dopings .",
    "the spin - polarized system has a large gap of about 4.6 ev . due to this gap ,",
    "the response of the system to a phonon is substantially weaker than for the paramagnetic state .",
    "for instance , @xmath78 contributes a softening of only about 4 mev for the spin - polarized system but 6 mev for a non spin - polarized system with a similar number of electrons .",
    "similarly , the contributions of @xmath79 are about 8 and 13 mev , respectively .",
    "we find that screening reduces the quantity @xmath78 by about a factor of two , i.e. , @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.5 ] ) . by evaluating the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we find that the zone boundary half - breathing phonon is broadened by about 0.4 mev for @xmath81 .",
    "this is similar to what bohnen _",
    "et al._@xcite found in an lda calculation .",
    "it is interesting to compare the half - breathing phonon and the @xmath82 breathing phonon . in the latter case",
    "all four o atoms surrounding a cu atom move towards this atom . in the model",
    "considered above ( @xmath65 ) and for @xmath83 , the model has nesting for @xmath15 .",
    "the result would be a very strong response for small @xmath14 , making the calculation rather meaningless .",

    "we adjust @xmath73 so that @xmath85 ev in the spin - polarized calculation for the undoped system , as found experimentally . for the doping @xmath86",
    "we find that the @xmath15 breathing phonon is softened by 11 mev .",

    "we have also performed a calculation for the @xmath76 half - breathing phonon in this model and for this doping .",
    "the softening is 7 mev , which again is smaller than for the the breathing phonon .",
    "this is contrary to experiment , where a larger softening is found for the half - breathing phonon .",
    "to make contact with the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , we transform the three - band model to a one - band model .",
    "we assume that the o @xmath68-levels are far below the cu @xmath21-levels ( in the electron picture ) .",
    "we can then project out the o @xmath68-levels and obtain a model with just effective cu @xmath21-levels .",
