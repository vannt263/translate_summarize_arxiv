    "the * n*onnegative * i*nverse * e*igenvalue * p*roblem ( niep ) asks which collections of @xmath0 complex numbers ( counting multiplicities ) occur as the eigenvalues of an @xmath0-by-@xmath0 matrix , all of whose entries are nonnegative real numbers .",
    "this is a long standing problem that is very difficult and , perhaps , the most prominent problem in matrix analysis . unlike many other inverse eigenvalue problems",
    ", tools are limited , and seemingly small results are very welcome .",
    "nonetheless , the problem is very attractive and has been attacked by many excellent researchers ( see references ) .",
    "there have been prior surveys of work on the niep ( @xcite ) , but none recently . with a great deal of important recent activity , a new survey , emphasizing this activity , will be welcome to anyone considering inquiry in this area .",
    "our intent here is to be broad and informal .",
    "another intriguing aspect of the niep is how many avenues can be taken to gain insight into it . thought about it spawns endless challenging and worthy specific questions .",
    "an example is how many interesting variations there are .",
    "the real niep ( r - niep ) restricts the question to real spectra , and the symmetric niep ( s - niep ) further restricts to real spectra that are realizable by symmetric nonnegative matrices .",
    "it is known @xcite that the row stochastic niep ( restriction to nonnegative matrices with row sums 1 ) is equivalent to the general niep , but the doubly stochastic niep ( ds - niep ) , restriction to matrices with both row and column sums 1 , is properly more restrictive , but no less difficult .",
    "of course , there are variations on the ds - niep , as well : the real ds - niep and the symmetric ds - niep .",
    "the jordan niep ( j - niep ) asks about possible jordan canonical forms , when there are repeated eigenvalues , and the diagonalizable niep ( d - niep ) is the special case in which the realizing matrix is diagonalizable . finally , there are graph niep s when we consider only nonnegative matrices with a given ( directed or undirected ) graph @xmath1 ( g - niep ) , or only matrices subordinate to same .",
    "further particularizations may also be imagined , but these are the primary ones , so far .",
    "we should also mention that the niep and each variation also has a trace 0 version .",
    "this considers only spectra , the sum of whose elements is 0 , or , equivalently , nonnegative matrices , each of whose diagonal entries is 0 . in some cases ,",
    "this is sufficiently restrictive , so as to make the problem easier .",
    "we denote by niep@xmath2 the set of all spectra enjoyed by some @xmath0-by-@xmath0 nonnegative matrix .",
    "such a spectrum is called * realizable * and a nonnegative matrix with the spectrum is called a * realization * or * realizing matrix*. the notation and terminology are similar for niep variants . a solution to the niep ( or variants ) , for a particular @xmath0 , is an `` explicit '' description of niep@xmath2 , viewed as a subset of vectors in @xmath3 .",
    "niep@xmath2 is a closed set that is connected , and even star - shaped from the origin ( or from the all 1 s vector @xmath4 ) .",
    "the set is also semi - algebraic , but is not generally convex .",
    "if @xmath5 is a proposed spectrum , we denote by @xmath6 the sum of its components , counting multiplies . other power sums",
    "@xmath7 , called @xmath8-th moments , are also important , and we usually reserve @xmath9 as the spectral radius of @xmath10 .    the perron - frobenius theory of nonnegative matrices ( _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite ) provides several simple , but important , necessary conditions for the niep ( and variations ) .",
    "these basic necessary conditions are presented in section [ se3 ] , followed by several more subtle necessary conditions .",
    "the `` jll '' conditions are now essential to work on the problem .",
    "the niep has a long history since its proposal by kolmogorov @xcite , and there are many substantial results .",
    "we begin at the natural starting point of the single eigenvalue problem ( section [ se2 ] ) for both the row stochastic niep and the ds - niep : which individual complex numbers occur in the spectra of row stochastic and of doubly stochastic matrices .",
    "the former is solved , but there have been important advances in the description of the solution and in realizations .",
    "the latter is unsolved , beyond @xmath11 , though there have been important recent developments .",
    "section [ se4 ] summarizes low - dimensional complete results for certain niep variants .",
    "general sufficient conditions for the realizability of spectra are given in section [ se5 ] .",
    "it has long been known that @xmath0-fold spectra that meet simple necessary conditions , but are not realizable , may be made realizable by appending of 0 eigenvalues .",
    "information about this phenomenon is given in section [ se6 ] .",
    "we turn to what is known about the graph - niep s in section [ se7 ] .",
    "the new idea of perron similarities - studying the diagonalizable niep s via the diagonalizing similarities - is discussed in section [ se8 ] , and the role of jordan structure in the niep and r - niep in section [ se9 ] .",
    "in @xcite , kolmogorov posed the problem , denoted by sisep ( * s*tochastic * i*nverse * s*ingle * e*igenvalue * p*roblem ) , of characterizing the subset of the complex plane , denoted by @xmath12 , consisting of the individual eigenvalues of all @xmath0-by-@xmath0 stochastic matrices .",
    "it can easily be verified that for each @xmath13 , the region @xmath12 is closed , inscribed in the unit - disc , star - convex ( with star - centers at zero and one ) , and symmetric with respect to the real - axis .",

    "* conjecture 1 ) ) , but there is computational evidence that suggests that the @xmath36 case is either a rare exception , or the only exception , to perfect - mirsky .",
    "for a proposed spectrum @xmath38 , repeats allowed , to be ( niep-)realizable , a number of necessary conditions are known .",
    "the most basic of these follow from the fact that a nonnegative matrix has real entries and nonnegative trace , and from the perron - frobenius theory of nonnegative matrices .",
    "( we assume the reader is familiar with the perron - frobenius theory , which is recounted , for example in @xcite . ) for simplicity , we label these according to simple titles",
    ". since a nonnegative matrix is real , it must have the eigenvalues of a real matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ the characteristic polynomial must have real coefficients , or , as a list    @xmath39    since the trace of a matrix is the sum of the eigenvalues and the trace of a nonnegative matrix is nonnegative , we also have    @xmath40    of course , it follows that if @xmath10 is realizable and @xmath41 , then all diagonal entries of any realizing matrix must be 0 .",
    "higher power sums are also nonnegative as they are traces of positive integral powers of nonnegative matrices :    @xmath42    according to the perron - frobenius theory , the spectral radius of a nonnegative matrix must , itself , be an eigenvalue , so among the eigenvalues @xmath10 must be a nonnegative one , at least as big in absolute value as any others . without loss of generality ,",
    "this one may be taken to be @xmath9 .",
    "so , we have    @xmath43    and if any of the other eigenvalues are the same as @xmath9 , any realizing matrix must be reducible .",
    "moreover , if all the inequalities are strict , any irreducible realizing matrix must be primitive .",
    "the above conditions are necessary for all the niep s , but there are some necessary conditions for particular niep s .",
    "further necessary conditions are more subtle , but many have been noticed .",
    "the most ubiquitous of these was noticed independently in @xcite and in @xcite and is usually referred to as the jll conditions .",
    "they generalize the trace condition and follow from the fact that every power of a nonnegative matrix is nonnegative and that positive diagonal entries must contribute to positive diagonal entries in powers ( _ e.g. _ @xmath44 implies @xmath45 for integers @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "the general ( quantitative ) version is    @xmath48    let @xmath20 be an @xmath0-by-@xmath0 real matrix with spectrum @xmath49 . denote the principal submatrix of @xmath20 lying in the rows and columns given by the index set @xmath50 by @xmath51.\\,$ ] define the @xmath8-elementary symmetric function @xmath52 and the @xmath8-newton coefficient @xmath53 since @xmath54 $ ] ,",
    "as well , @xmath55 may be viewed as the average value of the @xmath8-by-@xmath8 principal minors of @xmath20 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath10 is called * newton * if @xmath56 and these inequalities are referred to as the * newton inequalities * @xcite .",
    "they hold for @xmath57 @xcite , @xmath58 @xcite , and they are valid for real diagonal matrices , diagonalizable matrices with real spectra ( the @xmath59 are invariant under similarity ) , and matrices with real spectra . in @xcite it was proved that the newton inequalities also hold for @xmath60-matrices and , thus , inverse @xmath60-matrices and it was observed that if @xmath20 is a nonnegative matrix with spectral radius @xmath61 , then @xmath62 is an m - matrix and , therefore , must satisfy the newton inequalities .",
    "if we denote its spectrum @xmath63 by @xmath64 , then we have new necessary conditions :    @xmath65    0.3 cm in @xcite the authors did not focus the attention directly on the spectrum but on the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial .",
    "thus , the niep that they consider is : _ given real numbers @xmath66 , find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a nonnegative matrix of order @xmath0 with characteristic polynomial @xmath67_.    the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are closely related to the cyclic structure of the weighted digraph associated with the matrix @xmath20 , as established by the coefficients theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.3 * ) .",
    "the authors @xcite introduce graphic tools to study the niep from the characteristic polynomial and use the following method : if @xmath68 is a realizable polynomial , in the sense that there exists a nonnegative matrix with characteristic polynomial @xmath68 , we try to maximize each coefficient @xmath69 as a function of the previous coefficients , preserving the realizability for a polynomial of degree @xmath0 with the same previous coefficients .",
    "note that @xmath69 is a continuous function ( sum of determinants ) of the entries of a nonnegative matrix @xmath20 realizing the polynomial @xmath68 and that , as the previous coefficients are bounded above , then the entries of @xmath20 involved in the expression of @xmath69 are also bounded above ( coefficients theorem ) ; therefore , this maximum is attained . in this way ,",

    "* reality condition * : @xmath179 has real coefficients ; + and 3 .   * extended trace condition * : @xmath180 for all @xmath8 and @xmath181 implies @xmath182 for all @xmath22 .    the necessity of these conditions is easily verified ( the last one via jll , for example ) , and the interesting point is that necessary conditions become sufficient when primitivity is the goal and the dimension may be arbitrarily increased . when the perron condition is not strict it may not be possible to  save  a spectrum meeting obvious necessary conditions .",
    "the familiar example @xmath183 is not only not realizable , but is never the nonzero part of the spectrum of a nonnegative matrix .",
    "however , both @xmath184 and @xmath185 are both the nonzero parts of the spectra of primitive matrices for arbitrarily small @xmath186 ( though they are not realizable for @xmath187 small ) .",
    "more recently there have been further developments about realizability after appending 0 s to a spectrum . in @xcite",
    "there is matricial proof of key results from @xcite , which is much more explicit .",
    "though the number of 0 s needed to make a spectrum realizable may be very large ( and not easy to estimate from @xcite ) , estimates have recently been given under some circumstances by bringing @xmath188 , as well as the trace , into play @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , realizable spectra that are , in some way extremal , are often realizable by nonnegative matrices with many 0 entries , as are many non - extremal spectra .",
    "this raises the question that , if we fix the 0-pattern of a nonnegative matrix , how is the niep restricted , _",
    "i.e. _ which realizable spectra occur ? a natural way to describe a particular 0-pattern is via a graph , which could be directed or undirected . for a particular graph @xmath1 on @xmath0 vertices , consider the set of nonnegative @xmath0-by-@xmath0 matrices @xmath189 for which @xmath190 satisfies @xmath191 if and only if @xmath192 is a directed edge of @xmath1 .",
    "( here , we consider an undirected edge @xmath193 , if @xmath1 is undirected , to consist of two directed edges @xmath192 and @xmath194 . ) for simplicity we consider graphs without loops , so that no restriction is placed by the graph upon the diagonal entries , other than nonnegativity .",
    "the g - niep then just asks which spectra occur among matrices in @xmath189 ?",
    "( if we wish to emphasize the dimension , which we generally take to be implicit , we may write @xmath195 . ) of course the niep is just the union of the solutions to the g - niep s , over all directed graphs @xmath1 .",
    "the same is true for various variations upon the niep .",
    "for example , the solution to the s - niep is just the solution to the g - niep , restricted to symmetric matrices , over all undirected graphs . thus far , the g - niep has been considered only for undirected graphs @xmath1 , symmetric matrices and real eigenvalues .",
    "this seems a fertile area for future work .    a prototype of the g - niep , though not presented in graph terms , appeared in @xcite , in which tridiagonal matrices were considered .",
    "notice that the spectrum of a nonnegative tridiagonal matrix is not only necessarily real but also the spectrum of a symmetric tridiagonal nonnegative matrix .",
    "also , tridiagonal matrices are the case in which @xmath1 is a path ( and an edge only requires nonnegativity of the entry ) ; off - diagonal 0 entries are important .",
    "we say that a matrix @xmath20 is * subordinate * to a graph @xmath1 if @xmath196 has the same vertices as @xmath1 and the edges of @xmath196 are contained among those of @xmath1 ; equivalently , for @xmath190 , @xmath197 implies @xmath193 is an edge of @xmath1",
    ". the main result of @xcite is for the path @xmath198 on @xmath0 vertices .",
    "then , for @xmath199 , there is an @xmath0-by-@xmath0 matrix @xmath200 subordinate to @xmath198 and with eigenvalues @xmath201 if and only if @xmath202 @xmath203 .",
    "additional conditions , when the graph is precisely @xmath198 , are also discussed , but the results are incomplete .    in @xcite , the observation of @xcite is dramatically generalized . recall that a path is a tree and that all trees are bipartite ( but many non - trees are bipartite as well ) .",
    "all bipartite graphs are considered in @xcite .",
    "the main result is that @xmath204 are the eigenvalues of an @xmath0-by-@xmath0 nonnegative symmetric matrix @xmath20 subordinate to a given bipartite graph @xmath1 on @xmath0 vertices if and only if @xmath205 @xmath206 @xmath207 @xmath208 @xmath209 @xmath207 @xmath210 in which @xmath22 is the matching number of @xmath1 .",
    "( note that @xmath211 is the matching number of a path on @xmath0 vertices , so that the result of @xcite is a special case . )",
    "further observations about the s - niep for matrices subordinate to a given graph @xmath1 are also made .",
    "if @xmath212 is an invertible matrix and there is a real , diagonal , nonscalar matrix @xmath213 with @xmath214 , then @xmath212 is called a _",
    "perron similarity_. perron similarities were introduced by johnson and paparella to study the diagonalizable rniep and the sniep .",
    "perron similarities were characterized in several ways in @xcite and it was shown that @xmath215 is a _ polyhedral cone _ ,",
    "i.e. , a convex cone in @xmath216 with finitely - many extremals .",
    "this was called the _ ( perron ) spectracone of @xmath212 _ , and a certain cross - section , a polytope called the _ ( perron ) spectratope of @xmath212 _ , was also discussed .",
    "these polyhedral sets were used to verify the known necessary and sufficient conditions for the rniep and the sniep for orders up to four . for orders @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 , it is shown that a finite number of perron similarities are required to cover the realizable region , whereas when @xmath110 , it is shown , via the _ relative gain array _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , that an uncountable number of perron similarities is required to cover the realizable region .",
    "for every @xmath220 , the spectracone and spectratope of @xmath221 were characterized , where @xmath221 denotes the _ canonical hadamard matrix of order @xmath222_. more specifically , the spectracone of @xmath221 is the conical hull of its rows and the spectratope of @xmath221 is the convex hull of its rows .",
    "the spectratope of a general , normalized hadamard matrix was used to give a constructive proof , for _ hadamard orders _ , of a result by fiedler @xcite , that every _ sulemanova spectrum _ is the spectrum of a symmetric nonnegative matrix ( in fact , this result was strengthened to show that the constructed realizing matrix is also _ doubly stochastic _ ) .",
    "it is still an open problem to find a constructive proof that every sulemanova spectrum is sniep - realizable . a constructive proof of the boyle - handelman theorem for sulemanova  spectrum : augmenting any such spectrum with zeros up to a hadamard order yields a spectrum realizable by a nonnegative matrix that is symmetric and doubly stochastic .",
    "when there are repeated eigenvalues in a proposed spectrum , a natural question is whether jordan structure for the repeated eigenvalues can play a role in realizability .",
    "the j - niep asks which particular jordan canonical forms occur for @xmath0-by-@xmath0 nonnegative matrices and the d - niep is the special case of which spectra occur among diagonalizable @xmath0-by-@xmath0 nonnegative matrices . of course",
    ", the d - niep and the niep are the same for spectra with distinct eigenvalues .",
    "it is also a simple exercise that any spectrum that is d - niep realizable by a positive matrix is also j - niep realizable for any jordan canonical form possible for its eigenvalues .",
    "however , whether d - niep realizability always implies j - niep realizability for any possible jordan form in unclear .",
    "this is so for sulemanova spectra @xcite .",
    "there are spectra that are realizable ( in fact , r - niep realizable ) , but are not diagonalizably realizable .",
    "the smallest dimension in which this occurs is 5 . for @xmath109 , any realizable spectrum with (",
    "non - real ) complex eigenvalues is diagonalizably realizable ( the only difficulty could come from a multiple perron root and that is easily handled by a reducibility argument ) . for @xmath109 ,",
    "r - niep and s - niep realizability are the same , which settles the matter .",
    "however , for @xmath36 , the spectrum @xmath223 is realizable for @xmath224 , @xcite .",
    "however , it is diagonalizably realizable iff @xmath225 ( in which case it is also symmetrically realizable ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath226 , this 5-spectrum is realizable ( apparently nondiagonalizably ) , but not diagonalizably so .",
    "this suggests that this phenomenon is fairly common .                                                                                                              c. r. johnson , c. marijun , m. pisonero , symmetric nonnegative realizability via partitioned majorization , _ linear multilinear algebra _ ( 2016 ) , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03081087.2016.1242113 , in press .                        t. j. laffey , realizing matrices in the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem , _ matrices and group representations ( coimbra , 1998 ) _ , volume19 of _ textos mat .",
