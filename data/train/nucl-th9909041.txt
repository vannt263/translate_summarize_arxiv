    "chiral symmetry requires that the nucleon mass has the form @xmath1 for small @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are functions of the strong coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that using physical insights from chiral perturbation theory and heavy quark effective theory one can derive new functional forms which describe the extrapolation of light baryon masses as functions of the pion mass @xmath8 .",
    "these forms are applicable beyond the chiral perturbative regime and have been compared successfully with predictions from the cloudy bag model @xcite and recent dynamical fermion lattice qcd calculations .",
    "by now it is well established that chiral symmetry is dynamically broken in qcd and that the pion is almost a goldstone boson .",
    "it is strongly coupled to baryons and therefore plays a significant role in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 self energies . in the limit where the baryons are heavy ,",
    "the pion - induced self energies of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 , to one loop , are given by the processes shown in fig .",
    "[ se - fig](a  d ) .",
    "we label these by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "note that we have restricted the intermediate baryon states to those most strongly coupled , namely the @xmath9 and @xmath10 states .",
    "other intermediate states are suppressed by the baryon form factor describing the extended nature of baryons .    the leading non - analytic contribution ( lnac ) of these self energy diagrams",
    "is associated with the infrared behavior of the corresponding integrals ",
    "i.e. , the behavior as the loop momentum @xmath15 . as a consequence ,",
    "it should not depend on the details of a high momentum cut - off , or form factor .",
    "in particular , it is sufficient for studying the lnac to evaluate the self energy integrals using a simple sharp cut - off , @xmath16 as the choice of form factor .",
    "the explicit forms of the self energy contributions for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and so on are given in @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is little phenomenological difference between this step function and the more natural dipole , provided one can tune the cut - off parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the self energies involving transitions of @xmath18 or @xmath19 are characterized by a branch point at @xmath20 .",
    "the leading non - analytic ( lna ) terms are those which correspond to the lowest order non - analytic functions of @xmath21  i.e. , odd powers or logarithms of @xmath22 . by expanding the expressions given in @xcite , we find that the lna contributions to the nucleon / delta masses are in agreement with the well known results of @xmath23pt @xcite .    of course , our concern with respect to lattice qcd is not so much the behavior as @xmath24 , but the extrapolation from high pion masses to the physical pion mass . in this context",
    "the branch point at @xmath25 is at least as important as the lna behaviour near @xmath26 .",
    "heavy quark effective theory suggests that as @xmath27 the quarks become static and hadron masses become proportional to the quark mass . in this spirit , corrections are expected to be of order @xmath28 where @xmath21 is the heavy quark mass .",
    "thus we would expect the pion induced self energy to vanish as @xmath28 as the pion mass increases .",
    "the presence of a fixed cut - off @xmath17 acts to suppress the pion induced self energy for increasing pion masses . while some @xmath29 dependence in @xmath17 is expected , this is a second - order effect and does not alter this qualitative feature . indeed , in the large @xmath22 limit of the equations , we find that they tend to zero at least as fast as @xmath30 .",
    "the agreement with both the chiral limit and expected behaviour in the heavy quark limit suggests the following functional form for the extrapolation of the nucleon mass @xcite : @xmath31",
    "we consider two independent lattice simulations of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 masses from cp - pacs @xcite and ukqcd @xcite . both of these use improved actions to study baryon masses in full qcd with two light flavours .",
    "we find that the two data sets are consistent , provided one allows the parameters introducing the physical scale to float within systematic errors of 10% .",
    "we begin by considering the functional form suggested in section [ analyticity - sec ] with the cut - off @xmath17 fixed to the value determined by fitting cbm calculations .",
    "this is shown as the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ 3fits - n - fig ] . in order to perform model",
    "independent fits ( i.e. with @xmath17 unconstrained ) , it is essential to have lattice simulations at light quark masses approaching @xmath32 gev@xmath33 .",
    "this fit is illustrated by the dash - dot curve .",
    "common practice in the lattice community to use a polynomial expansion for the mass dependence of hadron masses .",
    "motivated by @xmath23pt the lowest odd power of @xmath34 allowed is @xmath35 : @xmath36 the result of such a fit for the @xmath9 is shown in the dashed curve of fig .",
    "[ 3fits - n - fig ] .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath37 term , which is the leading non - analytic term in the quark mass , in the three parameter fit is @xmath38 .",
    "this disagrees with the coefficient of @xmath39 known from @xmath23pt ( which is correctly incorporated in eq .",
    "( [ n - form - eqn ] ) , the solid and dash - dot curves ) by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this clearly indicates the failings of such a simple fitting procedure .",
    "in the quest to connect lattice measurements with the physical regime , we have explored the quark mass dependence of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 baryon masses using arguments based on analyticity and heavy quark limits .",
    "we have determined a method to access quark masses beyond the regime of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this method reproduces the leading non - analytic behavior of @xmath23pt and accounts for the internal structure for the baryon under investigation .",
    "we find that the leading non - analytic term of the chiral expansion dominates from the chiral limit up to the branch point at @xmath40 mev , beyond which @xmath23pt breaks down .",
    "the predictions of the cbm , and two - flavour dynamical - fermion lattice qcd results , are succinctly described by the formulae derived in @xcite .",
    "the curvature around @xmath41 , neglected in previous extrapolations of the lattice data , leads to shifts in the extrapolated masses of the same order as the departure of lattice estimates from experimental measurements ."
