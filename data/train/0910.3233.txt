    "using the interferometric bidimensional spectrometer ( ibis ) and the echelle spectrograph on the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) of the sacramento peak national solar observatory , and the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) on the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) , @xcite have identified upward propagating gravity waves with frequencies between 0.7 mhz and 2.1 mhz in weak magnetic field regions of the solar atmosphere , and found that their energy flux is an order of magnitude larger than co - spatial acoustic waves , and comparable to the expected quiet - sun chromospheric losses of around 4.3 @xmath0 .",
    "however , the gravity waves were found to be significantly suppressed in stronger field regions .",
    "nevertheless , in light of recent identification of ubiquitous alfvn waves in the corona @xcite , they postulate that when these gravity waves enter magnetic regions they may efficiently couple to alfvn waves , perhaps contributing to the observed coronal wave flux .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have directly identified torsional alfvn waves in h@xmath1 bright - point groups at frequencies as low as 1.4 mhz , which places them at least partially in the gravity wave regime if there is any coupling .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the propagation , reflection , and mode conversion of atmospheric gravity waves of around 1 mhz in frequency using both dispersion relations and numerical solution of the governing differential equations in simple atmospheric models with uniform inclined magnetic field .",
    "the imposed fields of 10 to 100 gauss are weak in the photospheric context , but become dominant at greater heights as the plasma @xmath2 ( the ratio of plasma to magnetic pressure ) falls below unity due to density stratification .",
    "we therefore have a situation where low frequency waves are essentially gravity waves at low altitudes , but become magnetically dominated at higher levels in the chromosphere .",
    "the central question is : _ what happens to upward propagating gravity waves as they enter regions where magnetic forces become significant ?",
    "does the magnetic field help or hinder propagation through the chromosphere ? _",
    "the answer is : both , depending on magnetic field orientation .",
    "we adopt the horizontally invariant val c model of @xcite , as adapted by @xcite , up to @xmath3 mm .",
    "the interesting wave reflections and conversions all happen below this height .",
    "an isothermal top is appended above 1.6 mm .",
    "no transition region is included , to avoid the complication of reflections outside our region of interest .",
    "the linear adiabatic wave equations for this scenario are set out in @xcite , where exact series solutions are derived for the isothermal case .",
    "these are used here to specify top boundary conditions , which are always applied in the isothermal layers .    without loss of generality",
    ", the waves we consider are assumed to propagate in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field is then adjusted to explore various geometries .",
    "we distinguish the two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) cases :    2d : : :    the magnetic field lies in the same vertical    ( @xmath4-@xmath5 ) plane as the direction of wave    propagation , and is inclined an angle @xmath6 from the    vertical ; 3d : : :    the vertical plane containing magnetic field lines makes an angle    @xmath7 to the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",
    "in general , in cartesian coordinates @xmath8 , the magnetic field vector is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "in light of the recent identification of ubiquitous horizontal magnetic field of up to 50100 g in quiet internetwork regions using the solar optical telescope / spectro - polarimeter ( sot / sp ) on _ hinode _",
    "@xcite , particular attention shall be given to highly inclined field .",
    "we use two mathematical tools : the magneto - acoustic - gravity dispersion relation ( and the ray calculations which derive from it ) , and numerical integration of the @xmath11 order ( 2d ) or @xmath12 order ( 3d ) wave equations .",
    "dispersion relations are widely used to describe oscillations in weakly inhomogeneous media , where the properties of the medium vary slowly on the length scale of a typical wavelength .",
    "this property allows us to effectively fourier analyse in space ( and time assuming a steady or slowly varying background ) to obtain a relationship between frequency @xmath13 and wavevector @xmath14 .",
    "the development of dispersion relations is intimately connected with determination of where the solutions of wave equations will be oscillatory and where non - oscillatory .",
    "this is a difficult enough task for gravitationally stratified unmagnetized atmospheres @xcite , let alone magneto - atmospheres .",
    "the difficulty ultimately revolves around the definition of the acoustic cutoff frequency @xmath15 which , depending on choice of dependent and independent variables , can take many distinct forms .",
    "there is simply no such thing as _ the _ acoustic cutoff frequency , and hence no firm and unambiguous way to precisely distinguish oscillatory and non - oscillatory regions .",
    "the most commonly quoted expression is that of @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the sound speed and @xmath18 is the density scale height .",
    "height @xmath5 increases upward .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , the appearance of the second derivative of the density in this expression renders it largely impractical for use with tabulated atmospheres in many cases . with the widely used model s @xcite",
    ", it yields an enormous but very thin spike just below the solar surface ( see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is inconsistent with the assumption of slow variation of coefficients for any solar waves of practical interest .",
    "although @xcite derive more attractive alternatives in the hydrodynamic case , these have not yet been extended to magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "we are therefore in uncertain territory applying dispersion relations to solar atmospheric waves , especially in the few hundred kilometres below the surface . however , above the surface , the situation is less troublesome .",
    "all suggested formulations for @xmath15 agree in the isothermal atmosphere case , where @xmath19 , returning the so - called isothermal acoustic cutoff frequency @xmath20 indeed , for an isothermal atmosphere , there are exact solutions which confirm precisely this expression : see @xcite for the hydrodynamic case and @xcite with uniform magnetic field added .",
    "consequently , in the lower solar atmosphere , where @xmath18 varies ( comparatively ) little and slowly , we may adopt equation ( [ cutoffi ] ) with the expectation of obtaining at least qualitatively correct results .",
    "furthermore , for the gravity waves which interest us most here , it is the brunt - visl frequency @xmath21 ( about which there is no dispute ) that is most relevant .",
    "figure [ fig : freqs ] plots the acoustic cutoff and buoyancy frequencies in the model atmosphere .",
    "most significantly , the brunt - visl frequency in the val c atmosphere decreases steeply from around 6 mhz to approximately 1 mhz between 0.6 mm and 1.5 mm , indicating a propensity to trap gravity waves in the low chromosphere .",

    "the dispersion function ( [ dr ] ) reduces to that set out in equation ( 12 ) of @xcite in the 2d case @xmath37 , with the addition of the decoupled alfvn factor @xmath38 .",
    "it also takes the usual magnetoacoustic form @xmath39 in the absence of stratification , and the standard acoustic gravity wave form @xmath40 without magnetic field .",
    "the first term @xmath41 provides the coupling between the magnetoacoustic and alfvn waves in three dimensions .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath42 restricts allowable solutions in @xmath14-@xmath13 space .",
    "now , in a horizontally and temporally invariant medium as is assumed here , @xmath13 and the horizontal component @xmath43 of @xmath14 do not change with height , but the vertical component @xmath44 does .",

    "figure [ fig : b0 ] displays a representative propagation diagram for the val c atmosphere in the absence of magnetic field . as there is little difference in the curves with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the former will be used exclusively throughout .",
    "the dispersion relation reduces to @xmath50 in this case , clearly indicating vertical evanescence for @xmath51 for all @xmath43 .",
    "even if @xmath52 , the wave is evanescent for small enough @xmath43 .",
    "this explains why the gravity wave dispersion curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : b0 ] is trapped below about 1.2 mm in a `` gravity cavity '' .",
    "it is important to note that the upgoing branch in fig .",
    "[ fig : b0 ] is the _ lower _ one , given the well - known property of gravity waves that the vertical components of the phase and group velocities have opposite signs @xcite .",

    "we term the reduction of the effective acoustic cutoff frequency by the factor @xmath58 the `` ramp effect '' .",

    "the term @xmath63 alone would keep the phase of @xmath64 $ ] constant on field lines @xmath65constant , so it is the remaining square root terms which determine phase along field lines for these two field - aligned wave modes .",
    "in other words , @xmath66 disappears if @xmath5 is redefined as height along a fixed field line rather than at fixed @xmath4 .",
    "such a term is expected in the low-@xmath2 regime where the rigidity of the magnetic field lines dominates .",
    "it is purely geometric .",
    "the remaining fast magneto - acoustic wave is always evanescent for fixed @xmath13 and @xmath43 and large enough @xmath54 since its dispersion relation is @xmath67 .",
    "although convenient and informative , the dispersion relation is only an approximate tool .",
    "we corroborate our results by numerically integrating the linear adiabatic wave equations across @xmath68 mm .",
    "the integrated equations do not depend upon @xmath15 explicitly , and so are not subject to the uncertainties associated with that term .",

    "we do this by imposing @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the plasma displacement vector ( though the @xmath73 equation is redundant in 2d where @xmath73 decouples ) , and @xmath74 is the gravito - acoustic annihilator operator defined by @xmath75\\ , .",

    "therefore , in the region @xmath70 where the gravito - acoustic and magnetic waves are fully decoupled , it strongly suppresses the gravito - acoustic waves , leaving only the slow ( magnetic ) waves .",
    "the factor @xmath76 in ( [ annih ] ) removes an amplitude factor in the remaining sinusoidal slow waves .",
    "the @xmath77 operator then selects the upcoming magnetic wave , which is set to zero with this condition .",
    "the incoming alfvn wave is similarly suppressed by the second equation in ( [ radn ] ) .",

    "[ fig : f10theta ] shows that both acoustic and alfvnic flux exits the top in this 3d case , though with the magnetic flux dominating . comparing with the dispersion curve , the eikonal connectivity is to the alfvn branch , but the gap ( avoided crossing ) to the acoustic branch is narrow .",

    "this is reminiscent of fig",
    ".  2 in @xcite , though shifted here to much higher @xmath6 because of the lower frequency .",
    "[ fig : alf ] illustrates this further using dispersion diagrams . in 2d",
    "the alfvn branch is inaccessible , and so carries no flux .",
    "however , as the magnetic field is rotated out of the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane , the upgoing gravity wave branch instantly connects to the alfvn branch at large @xmath5 .",
    "most energy continues to flow along the low-@xmath2 acoustic branch though by jumping the ( small ) gap that has opened up as an avoided crossing ( primarily because the polarizations are still almost orthogonal at small @xmath106 ) . at larger @xmath106 ( @xmath109 and @xmath130",
    "are illustrated here ) the gap is very large and so the energy flows overwhelmingly along the dispersion curve onto the alfvn branch .",
    "however , by @xmath131 this upgoing alfvn branch has been cut off ( due to the term under the square root in ( [ alf_kz ] ) becoming negative ) and the connectivity is now to a downgoing alfvn wave , explaining the precipitous drop in alfvn flux with increasing @xmath106 seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : fz ] illustrates how wave energy flux may shift from acoustic to magnetic near the @xmath94 equipartition level in 3d .",
    "also note the _ negative _ magnetic flux at the bottom , indicating some significant reflected alfvn and/or slow magneto - acoustic flux there .",
    "typically , the conversion to alfvn waves occurs over a broader and slightly higher region than is characteristic of fast / slow conversion , and that is apparent here , with a steady conversion process taking place between roughly 1 mm and 1.5 mm .",
    "the fact that the dispersion locus which penetrates @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dtunnelling ] essentially sits right on top of the asymptotic alfvn curve ( red dotted ) shows just how well the acoustic - gravity and alfvn phase velocities match over an extended interval , which is very favourable for mode conversion @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ffreqs ] briefly addresses how the escaping wave energy fluxes at the top vary with frequency .",
    "the two cases shown are for 0.7 mhz and 2.1 mhz , but otherwise address the same case as in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f10theta ] .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar , except that the flux `` turns on '' at greater inclinations for lower frequency , and lesser inclinations for higher frequency , as expected from the ramp effect , which allows acoustic waves to propagate once @xmath57 .",
    "it is also notable that the magnitude of the alfvnic flux is considerably increased at higher frequency .",
    "the main conclusions we draw from our analyses are :    1 .",
    "even very weak magnetic fields very effectively reflect gravity waves back downward as slow magneto - acoustic waves .",
    "this typically happens well below the @xmath94 equipartition level .",
    "2 .   however , at very large magnetic field inclinations , typically around @xmath91 or more depending on frequency ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ffreqs ] ) , substantial mode conversion from gravity waves to either field - guided acoustic waves ( for small @xmath106 ) or alfvn waves ( @xmath132 ) occurs , and these waves continue to propagate upward along the field lines .",
    "the amount of energy they carry is potentially significant for the upper chromosphere .",
    "wave energy fluxes reaching the top of our model are very sensitive to magnetic field direction , but quite insensitive to magnetic field strength , at least in the range 10 g  100 g. 4 .",
    "the dispersion diagrams give a simple , easy and quite accurate picture of the behaviour of gravity waves in a magneto - atmosphere , though with the caveat that tunnelling can sometimes occur between branches .",
    "in simple terms , we conclude that atmospheric gravity waves are very effectively suppressed by even very weak magnetic field , _ unless _ that field is highly inclined and the attack angle fine , in which case it opens a window to the upper atmosphere that allows the gravity waves to propagate through in a different guise .",
    "this is closely related to the `` magnetic portals '' of @xcite which rely on the ramp effect to allow acoustic waves below the acoustic cutoff frequency to still propagate upward in low-@xmath2 inclined magnetic field , but in the case of low - frequency gravity waves which are already propagating , it gives them the opportunity to convert to propagating acoustic waves around the @xmath94 level . because of their low frequency though , very substantial inclination is required to open these windows , but no more than is characteristic of chromospheric canopy",
    ".     there are consequences for recent and future observations of solar atmospheric oscillations . the surprising extent to which even very weak vertical or moderately inclined magnetic field inhibits gravity waves by causing them to quickly reflect as slow magneto - acoustic waves perhaps explains `` significantly suppressed atmospheric gravity waves at locations of magnetic flux '' found by @xcite . the ubiquity of near - horizontal field in the low solar atmosphere discovered recently with _ hinode _",
    "@xcite however raises the possibility that low frequency gravity waves may efficiently couple to alfvn waves that continue to propagate vertically into the corona , contributing to the vast sea of waving field lines now known to exist there @xcite .",
    "although @xcite detect a peak in velocity power of these alfvn oscillations at around 3.5 mhz , ( presumably driven by the sun s internal normal modes ) , the power spectrum continues to rise with decreasing frequency till at least 1 mhz , well inside the gravity wave regime at photospheric level .",
    "it is tempting to postulate that gravity waves may be the vector of this wave energy at low levels and that it may convert to alfvn waves around the acoustic / alfvnic equipartition level in highly inclined field regions .",
    "further observational work , ideally at multiple heights , is warranted to more fully explore these possibilities .",
    "it should be emphasised though that our analysis is entirely linear .",
    "acoustic waves are likely to shock before reaching the upper chromosphere . however",
    ", alfvn waves do not suffer this fate .",
    "our models are also adiabatic , which is not a good representation of the chromosphere , though the detections of @xcite suggest that atmospheric radiative losses do not completely suppress gravity waves , at least at the photospheric altitudes sampled by ibis and mdi .",
    "the adiabatic assumption will be relaxed in future work .",
