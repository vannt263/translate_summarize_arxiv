    "recently , the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations have presented evidence for a higgs boson with a mass near 126  gev ( atlas ) and 125  gev ( cms in  @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the best fit to the signal strength @xmath9 in the @xmath10 search channel is about one standard deviation larger than expected in the standard model ( sm ) ; @xmath11 for atlas  @xcite , and @xmath12 for cms  @xcite .",
    "since then , several publications have studied the impact of a higgs boson in the 125  gev range on the parameter space of supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm  @xcite .",
    "whereas a higgs boson in the 125  gev range is possible within the parameter space of the minimal susy sm ( mssm )  @xcite , large radiative corrections involving heavy top squarks are required , which aggravates the `` little fine - tuning problem '' of the mssm .",
    "in addition , it would be difficult to explain a large enhancement of the diphoton signal strength in the mssm  @xcite .    within the next - to - minimal supersymmetric sm ( nmssm  @xcite ) ,",
    "a higgs boson in the 125  gev range is much more natural  @xcite : additional tree - level contributions and large singlet - doublet mixings in the cp - even higgs sector can push up the mass of the mostly sm - like higgs boson and , simultaneously , reduce its coupling to @xmath13-quarks which results in a substantial enhancement of its branching fraction into two photons  @xcite .",
    "studies of the parameter space of the general nmssm  including the dark matter relic density and dark matter nucleon cross section  were performed in  @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether these interesting features of the nmssm survive universality constraints on the soft susy breaking parameters at the gut scale .",
    "since this approach imposes severe restrictions on the sparticle masses and couplings , it allows to study whether these would be consistent with present constraints from direct and indirect sparticle searches , the dark matter relic density and dark matter direct detection experiments .",
    "moreover it allows to make predictions for future searches , both in the sparticle and the higgs sector .",
    "the ( fully constrained ) cnmssm  @xcite was analysed in  @xcite with the result that , once a relic density in agreement with wmap  @xcite is imposed , the higgs boson mass can barely be above 123  gev .",
    "we find that one should allow for deviations from full universality in the higgs sector , both for the nmssm - specific soft susy breaking terms and the mssm - like higgs soft masses like in the mssm studies in  @xcite . in analogy to the nuhm version of the mssm",
    ", we shall refer to such a model as nuh - nmssm for non - universal higgs nmssm .",
    "a first study of the nuh - nmssm was made in  @xcite which was confined , however , to the more mssm - like region of the parameter space of the nmssm involving small values of the nmssm - specific coupling @xmath1 , and hence small nmssm - specific effects in the cp - even higgs sector .    in the present paper",
    "we study the nuh - nmssm for large values of the nmssm - specific coupling @xmath1 ( and low @xmath3 ) where the singlet - doublet mixing in the cp - even higgs sector is large , and we find that the interesting features of the higgs sector of the nmssm observed in  @xcite can remain present , including constraints from searches for squarks and gluinos from atlas and cms  @xcite , constraints on the dark matter relic density from wmap  @xcite and on the dark matter nucleon cross section from xenon100  @xcite .",
    "our results in the higgs sector originate essentially from the strong mixing between all three cp - even higgs states in the nmssm : first , a higgs boson with a mass in the 125  gev range can have an enhanced diphoton signal strength up to @xmath14 .",
    "second , a lighter less sm - like higgs boson @xmath15 exists , with small couplings to electroweak gauge bosons if @xmath16  gev ( complying with lep constraints  @xcite ) , but a possibly detectable production cross section at the lhc if @xmath17  gev .",
    "in fact , a strongly enhanced diphoton signal strength @xmath18 of the higgs boson @xmath19 with its mass in the 125  gev range is possible only if @xmath20  gev .",
    "the heaviest cp - even higgs boson @xmath21 , like the heaviest mssm - like cp - odd and charged higgs bosons , have masses in the @xmath22  gev range , while the lightest mostly singlet - like cp - odd higgs state has a mass in the @xmath23  gev range .",
    "these comply with constraints both from @xmath24-physics and direct susy higgs searches also for lower masses due to the low values of @xmath3 considered here and the large singlet component of the lightest cp - odd state .    in the sparticle sector",
    "we require masses for the gluino and the first generation squarks to comply with constraints from present direct searches  @xcite , but we also study the effect of a reduced sensitivity due to the more complicated decay cascades in the nmssm  @xcite .",
    "the lightest top squark @xmath25 can be as light as @xmath26  gev ( still satisfying constraints from atlas  @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite , the latter due to its dominant decay into a chargino and a b - quark ) , and the required fine - tuning among the parameters at the gut scale remains modest .",
    "in the neutralino sector , the mixings among the five states ( bino , wino , two higgsinos and the singlino ) are large .",
    "the lsp , with a dominant higgsino component and a mass of @xmath27  gev , has a relic density complying with the wmap constraints  @xcite , and a direct detection cross section possibly within the reach of xenon100  @xcite .",
    "however , the supersymmetric contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is somewhat smaller than desired to account for the deviation of the measurement  @xcite from the sm .    in the next section we present the analysed parameter space of the nmssm with boundary conditions at the gut scale and the imposed phenomenological constraints ; our results are given in section  3 , and conclusions in section  4 .",
    "the nmssm differs from the mssm due to the presence of the gauge singlet superfield @xmath28 . in the simplest @xmath29 invariant realisation of the nmssm , the higgs mass term @xmath30 in the superpotential @xmath31 of the mssm",
    "is replaced by the coupling @xmath1 of @xmath28 to @xmath32 and @xmath33 and a self - coupling @xmath34 .",
    "hence , in this simplest version the superpotential @xmath35 is scale invariant , and given by [ eq:1 ] w _ = s h_uh_d + s^3 +  , where hatted letters denote superfields , and the ellipsis denote the mssm - like yukawa couplings of @xmath36 and @xmath37 to the quark and lepton superfields .",

    "the couplings of the cp - even higgs states depend on their decompositions into the weak eigenstates @xmath33 , @xmath32 and @xmath28 , which are denoted by [ eq:6 ] h_1 & = & s_1,d  h_d + s_1,u  h_u + s_1,s  s , + h_2 & = & s_2,d  h_d + s_2,u  h_u + s_2,s  s , + h_3 & = & s_3,d  h_d + s_3,u  h_u + s_3,s  s",

    "then the soft susy breaking mass terms for the higgs bosons @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are determined implicitely by @xmath62 , @xmath3 and @xmath63 .    in constrained versions of the nmssm ( as in the constrained mssm )",
    "one assumes that the soft susy breaking terms involving gauginos , squarks or sleptons are identical at the gut scale : [ eq:9 ] m_1 = m_2 = m_3 m_1/2 , [ eq:10 ] m_^2= m_^2=m_^2= m_^2=m_^2m_0 ^ 2 , [ eq:11 ] a_t = a_b = a_a_0 .    in the nuh - nmssm",
    "considered here one allows the higgs sector to play a special role : the higgs soft mass terms @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are allowed to differ from @xmath64 ( and determined implicitely as noted above ) , and the trilinear couplings @xmath65 , @xmath66 can differ from @xmath67 .",
    "hence the complete parameter space is characterized by [ eq:12 ]  ,  ,  , _  ,  a _  ,  a _  ,  a_0  ,  m_1/2  ,  m_0 , where the latter five parameters are taken at the gut scale .",
    "subsequently we are interested in regions of the parameter space implying large doublet - singlet mixing in the higgs sector , i.e. large values of @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) and low values of @xmath3 , which lead naturally to a sm - like higgs boson @xmath19 in the 125  gev range  @xcite . requiring @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we find 0.41 < & & < 0.69 , + 0.21 < & & < 0.46 , + 1.7 < & & < 6 [ eq:13 ] ( with many points for @xmath70 ) . it is intriguing that with these choices at the weak scale , one obtains @xmath71 for the running couplings at the gut scale ; hence all 3 yukawa couplings are close to ( but still below ) a landau singularity .",
    "we assume @xmath72 which implies @xmath73 .",
    "constraints on the soft susy breaking parameters depend strongly on the sparticle decay cascades . using the absence of signal at the lhc in the jets and missing transverse momentum search channels , bounds in the @xmath74 plane have been derived in the cmssm with @xmath75  @xcite . in the nuh - nmssm , however , we find lighter stops ( due to the lower values of @xmath3 implying a larger value of the top yukawa coupling , which affects the rge running of the soft susy breaking stop masses ) , and a modified neutralino sector which reduces the sensitivity in these search channels @xcite .",
    "hence , to start with , we impose only constraints from sparticle searches at lep  @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite , and from stop searches at the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite .",

    "[ eq:14 ] in addition we require that the fine - tuning @xmath76 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) satisfies @xmath77 , which implies upper bounds which will be discussed below .",
    "however , it is possible that the stronger cmssm - like constraints in the @xmath74 plane  @xcite also apply to the nuh - nmssm considered here .",

    "to do so , we have modified the code  @xcite inside nmssmtools  @xcite in order to allow for @xmath2 and @xmath63 to be used as input parameters at the weak scale and to compute the higgs soft masses @xmath59 , @xmath60 at the gut scale ; a corresponding version 3.2.0 will be made public soon . in , the two loop renormalization group equations ( rges ) between the weak and gut scales",
    "are integrated numerically for all parameters . in the presence of boundary conditions both at the weak and the gut scales as it is the case here ,",
    "these can be satisfied only through an iterative process .",
    "this iterative process is not guaranteed to converge , notably for large yukawa couplings as in  ( [ eq:13 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the rge integration algorithm within the latest public version 3.1.0 of nmssmtools had to be modified in version 3.2.0 to achieve convergence for large yukawa couplings .    in the higgs sector",
    "we have used two - loop radiative corrections from  @xcite , and for the top quark pole mass we use @xmath79  gev .",
    "our results in the next section use the reduced higgs production rates ( normalized with respect to the sm production rates ) in various channels .",
    "for gluon - gluon fusion we use the reduced higgs - gluon coupling as computed in nmssmtools , which takes care of all colored ( s)particles in the loop . for the low values of @xmath3 considered here , the top quark loop dominates by far , and leads essentially to @xmath80 as given in  ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "since a single particle loop dominates , radiative corrections not considered in nmssmtools tend to cancel in the ratio to the sm .",
