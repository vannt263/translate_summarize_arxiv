    "[ sec - intro ]    the ability of single - domain ferromagnets to preserve an accurate record of past magnetic fields has several important applications .",
    "fine grains in lava flows preserve a record of the direction of the geomagnetic field at the time they cooled , giving valuable insight into continental drift and the dynamics of the earth s core.@xcite of more direct technological importance is the potential application of single - domain ferromagnets to magnetic recording media , such as magnetic tapes and disks .    during the magnetic recording process , different regions of the medium are briefly exposed to strong magnetic fields , so that each grain is magnetized in the desired direction.@xcite since each grain can in principle store one bit of data , a greater storage density could ideally be achieved by a medium containing many small grains than by one containing a few large grains . however , in order to serve as reliable storage devices , the grains must be capable of retaining their magnetizations for long periods of time in weaker , arbitrarily oriented ambient magnetic fields  _ i.e. _ , they must have a high coercivity and a large remanence .",
    "since experiments show the existence of a particle size at which the coercivity is maximum ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .  ) , there is a tradeoff between high storage capacity and long - term data integrity which must give rise to an optimum choice of grain size for any given material . during both recording and storage , the relationships between the magnetic field , the size of the grain , and the lifetime of the magnetization opposed to the applied magnetic field are therefore of great technological interest .",
    "fine ferromagnetic grains have been studied for many years , but until recently such particles could be studied experimentally only in powders ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .  ) .",
    "this made it difficult to differentiate the statistical properties of single - grain switching from effects resulting from distributions in particle sizes , compositions , and local environments , or from interactions between grains .",
    "techniques such as magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .  ) and lorentz microscopy ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .  )",
    "now provide means for overcoming the difficulties in resolving the magnetic properties of individual single - domain particles .",
    "the standard theory of magnetization reversal in single - domain ferromagnets is due to nel@xcite and brown.@xcite in order to avoid an energy barrier due to exchange interactions between atomic moments with unlike orientations , nel - brown theory assumes uniform rotation of all the atomic moments in the system .",
    "the remaining barrier is caused by magnetic anisotropy,@xcite which may be either intrinsic or shape - induced .",
    "anisotropy makes it energetically favorable for each atomic moment to be aligned along one or more `` easy '' axes .",
    "buckling , fanning , and curling are , like uniform rotation , theoretical relaxation processes with few degrees of freedom and global dynamics.@xcite    however , for highly anisotropic materials there exists an alternative mode of relaxation with a typically much shorter lifetime .",
    "small regions of the phase in which the magnetization is parallel to the applied magnetic field ( the `` stable '' phase ) are continually created and destroyed by thermal fluctuations within the phase in which the magnetization is antiparallel to the field ( the `` metastable '' phase ) .",
    "as long as such a region ( henceforth referred to as a `` droplet '' ) is sufficiently small , the short - ranged exchange interaction with the surrounding metastable phase imposes a net free - energy penalty , and the droplet will , with high probability , shrink and vanish .",
    "should the droplet become larger than a critical size , however , this penalty will be less than the benefit obtained from orienting parallel to the magnetic field , and the droplet will with a high probability grow further , eventually consuming the grain .",
    "the nature of the metastable decay thus depends on the relative sizes of the grain , the critical droplet , the average distance between droplets , and the lattice constant , as discussed in detail , _",
    "e.g. _ , in refs .  .",
    "for systems in which short - range interactions dominate , fig .",
    "[ fig : hsroad ] sketches the four regions of the space of magnetic fields and particle sizes distinguished by different behaviors during metastable decay . for a more complete , recent review of droplet theory , see ref .  .",
    "it is important to understand the difference between a droplet and a domain.@xcite although they are both spatially contiguous regions of uniform magnetization , a domain is an equilibrium feature whereas _ a droplet is a strictly non - equilibrium entity . _",
    "the domain structure of two - dimensional dipole systems has been extensively investigated.@xcite the magnetostatic dipole - dipole interaction produces a demagnetizing field , which results in the stabilization of a domain structure in large ferromagnetic particles at equilibrium .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the effects of long - range dipole - dipole interactions on the _ nonequilibrium _ phenomenon of magnetization switching in single - domain ferromagnetic particles . towards this end",
    "we employ a simplified model in which particles in equilibrium can have only one or two domains , and we emphasize the single - domain case .",
    "detailed descriptions of both the static and dynamic properties of fine ferromagnetic grains have typically been formulated from micromagnetic studies.@xcite this method involves coarse - graining the physical lattice onto a computational lattice and then solving the partial differential equations for the evolution of magnetic structures on the computational lattice .",
    "although micromagnetics provides a good treatment for the anisotropy and demagnetizing fields , it treats thermal effects rather crudely , usually just by making the domain - wall energy temperature - dependent .",
    "a somewhat better approximation for thermal fluctuations within the underlying differential equations is to include small fluctuations using a langevin noise term.@xcite a better treatment for thermal and time - dependent effects is therefore monte carlo simulation ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .  ) . even when the physical phenomena can be accurately simulated , however , it will be difficult to understand the results without an adequate theoretical basis .",
    "because of its simplicity , the kinetic nearest - neighbor ising model has been extensively studied as a prototype for metastable dynamics ( see ref .   and references cited therein ) .",
    "in particular , square- and cubic - lattice ising systems with periodic boundary conditions have been used to study grain - size effects in ferroelectric switching.@xcite a related one - dimensional model has been used to study magnetization reversal in elongated ferromagnetic particles.@xcite in a recent article,@xcite we applied statistical - mechanical droplet theory and monte carlo simulations of two - dimensional ising systems to obtain a qualitative approximation for the dynamical behavior of real single - domain particles magnetized opposite to an applied field . in so doing , we made several simplifying approximations , one of which was the absence of a demagnetizing field . in this article",
    "we consider the effect of a small demagnetizing field on ising systems , and compare our analytic calculations with simulations of two - dimensional ising systems .",
    "specifically , for systems in the stochastic region ( discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - stochastic ] ) , the demagnetizing fields we consider must be sufficiently small that the system is consists of a single domain in equilibrium , whereas in the multi - droplet region ( discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - multidrop ] ) it is sufficient to have for demagnetizing field to be much smaller than the applied field . some preliminary results were presented in ref .  .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec - stochastic ] we discuss the stochastic region in terms of an approximate free - energy functional and give some numerical results . in sec .",

    "unfortunately , however , the last sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_cald ] ) slows down monte carlo simulations significantly , which is problematic if a large number of realizations are desired for good statistics , as is the case in nonequilibrium studies .",
    "the last sum also would make a perturbative expansion in the demagnetizing field ( adjustable by changing @xmath12 or the sample shape ) difficult .",
    "we therefore instead use the simpler hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a function of the crystal symmetry , the shape of the system , and @xmath12 .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : ham_cald ] ) and ( [ eq : ham_d ] ) are equivalent for general ellipsoids _ uniformly _ magnetized along a principal axis . for the special case of a perpendicularly magnetized plane with square - lattice symmetry , @xmath18 . for non - uniformly magnetized systems ,",

    "the length scale on which we would expect a transition from a single - domain to a multi - domain equilibrium structure is approximately @xmath23 .",
    "the selection of the ising model is equivalent to requiring a very large ( infinite , in fact ) anisotropy constant .",
    "although magnetic materials used in magnetic recording media require comparatively large anisotropy constants,@xcite the microscopic anisotropy tends to be much smaller than the exchange energy .",
    "however , the role of the anisotropy is enhanced by coarse - graining .",
    "simplicity is our main reason for choosing the two - dimensional ising model with periodic boundary conditions , particularly since many equilibrium properties of the two - dimensional ising model in zero field are known exactly@xcite and since the kinetics of metastable decay has been extensively studied for this model.@xcite as a result , our model systems more closely resemble ultrathin magnetic films with perpendicular magnetization than magnetic grains .",
    "a more realistic simulation of three - dimensional grains is planned for later study , but we emphasize that we expect that droplet theory applies to almost any spin model with high anisotropy .",
    "accordingly , equations are written in forms appropriate for arbitrary dimensionality @xmath7 , even though simulations are only carried out for @xmath24 .",
    "the relaxation kinetics is simulated by the single - spin - flip metropolis dynamic with updates at randomly chosen sites . a rigorous derivation from microscopic quantum hamiltonians of the stochastic glauber dynamic used in monte carlo simulations of ising models has been established in the thermodynamic limit;@xcite both the glauber and metropolis algorithms are spatially local dynamics with non - conserved order parameter ( the dynamic universality class of model a in the classification scheme of hohenberg and halperin@xcite ) and are therefore expected to differ only in non - universal features .",
    "the metropolis dynamic is realized by the original metropolis algorithm@xcite and the @xmath25-fold way algorithm.@xcite ( for a discussion on the equivalence of the dynamics of these algorithms , see ref .  . )",

    "the @xmath25-fold way algorithm is similar , but involves the tabulation of energy classes .",
    "first an energy class is chosen randomly with the appropriately weighted probability .",
    "a single site is then chosen from within that class with uniform probability and flipped with probability one .",
    "the number of metropolis algorithm steps which would be required to achieve this change is chosen from a geometric probability distribution,@xcite and the time , measured in monte carlo steps per spin ( mcss ) , is incremented accordingly .",
    "the @xmath25-fold way algorithm is more efficient than the metropolis algorithm at low temperatures , where the metropolis algorithm requires many attempts before a change is made .    because we are using single - spin - flip dynamics ,",
    "the magnetization can only change by a small amount from one time step to the next .",
    "the dynamical effects of the demagnetizing field thus depend only on the _ change _ in the magnetic part of @xmath32 between adjacent values of the magnetization . in this way it is possible to define an _ effective _ magnetic field @xmath33",
    "the effective magnetic field is thus site - independent .",
    "this fact makes analytic considerations significantly easier and is our principal reason for using eq .",

    "e.g. _  in refs .  .",
