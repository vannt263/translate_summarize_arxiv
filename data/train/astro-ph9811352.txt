    "the discovery of brown dwarfs in the field by infrared surveys as well as by a proper motion survey has demonstrated both the existence and the abundance of such objects .",
    "three brown dwarf candidates , denis - p j0205.41159 , j1058.71547 , and j1228.21547 were reported by delfosse et al .",
    "( for simplicity we refer to these objects as d0211 , d1015 , and d1215 . )",
    "the detection of lithium in d1215 suggests that it is a brown dwarf ( martn et al .",
    "1997 ; tinney , delfosse , & forveille 1997 ) ; however , d1015 did not show any lithium in its spectrum .",
    "there were no observations searching for lithium in d0211 reported at the time this paper was written , although the spectrum of d0211 shows that it is the coolest object of the three and therefore it most likely is a brown dwarf ( delfosse et al . 1997 ; tinney et al .",
    "another field brown dwarf , kelu-1 , was discovered in a proper motion survey ( ruiz , leggett , & allard 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of lithium in this object , its estimated effective temperature , and its absolute magnitude all indicate that it is a brown dwarf .    in this paper , we report on new @xmath2-band spectra of d0211 , d1015 , and d1215 , as well as narrowband photometry at 1.283.8 @xmath0 m .",
    "spectra at 1.92.5 @xmath0 m were obtained with the cgs-4 infrared spectrograph at the ukirt on 1997 december 2324 .",
    "the 40 lines mm@xmath3 grating used provides a spectral resolution of 900 at 2.2 @xmath0 m with a 0.6@xmath4 slit . for the removal of the telluric absorption lines",
    ", we observed the bright stars hr 692 ( f0v ) , hr 831 ( f6iii  iv ) , and hr 1978 ( f0iii ) . the spectra were obtained by oversampling by a factor of 3 .",
    "this was achieved by moving the detector array one - third of a resolution element between exposures . during the observations",
    "every fourth column of the array was unusable due to an electronic problem .",
    "we were able to recover the spectrum because each resolution element was sampled with three grating positions .",
    "however a ripple that was caused by the rejection of every fourth column remained in the spectrum .",
    "this ripple was eliminated by applying a fourier transform to the spectrum , removing the frequencies corresponding to the ripple , and then applying the inverse fourier transform .",
    "the ripple was not evident after this processing , and the division by a standard star spectrum showed no artifacts from the bad columns of the array . at the final stage of reduction ,",
    "the spectra were smoothed with a 3-pixel boxcar function that matched the spectral resolution of the spectrograph .",
    "the spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "narrowband filter photometry at 1.28 , 1.68 , and 2.18 @xmath0 m and at l@xmath5 ( 3.76 @xmath0 m ) were obtained with the nsfcam infrared camera at the irtf on 1997 december 2829 ut .",
    "the observations at 1.28 @xmath0 m were obtained with a narrowband 1% filter and at 1.68 and 2.18  @xmath0 m using a 1% circular variable filter .",
    "photometric standard stars hd106965 and hd18881 were used ( elias et al . 1982 ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the uncertainty in the observations is about 2% .    for d1015 and d1215",
    "the flux density was consistent with that determined from the spectral standard ( hr 1978 ) and by using a @xmath6 color appropriate for the spectral type of the standard . for d02 - 11",
    "there was a 22% discrepancy between the narrowband photometry and the spectral standard star .",
    "this discrepancy may have arisen from the @xmath2 magnitude uncertainty of the spectral standard stars ( hr 692 and hr 831 ) or from loss of light at the slit .",
    "therefore we renormalized the spectrum to the flux density obtained from the narrowband photometry .",
    "spectra presented by martn et al . ( 1997 ) and tinney et al . (",
    "1997 ) suggest that the order of warmer to cooler is : d1015 , d1215 , and d0211 .",
    "the spectra are shown in this order in figure 1 .",
    "strong h@xmath1o absorption at 2.0 @xmath0 m and co absorption at 2.3 @xmath0 m are evident .",
    "the overall spectral shapes of d1015 and d1215 are similar but that of d0211 is quite different in the following aspects : ( 1 ) there is a steeper rise of the spectrum from 2.02.1 @xmath0 m , and ( 2 ) there is a `` dip '' at 2.12.3 @xmath0 m compared with d1015 and d1215 ( more easily seen in fig .",
    "the dip is also seen in the spectrum of d0211 presented by delfosse et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "closer inspection of the spectra shows additional spectral differences : ( 1 ) there is an absorption feature at 2.01 @xmath0 m in d0211 that is not seen in d1015 and d1215 .",
    "( 2 ) there is a difference in the slope of the spectrum at 1.952.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "d0211 is flat , but d1015 and d1215 are both rising toward shorter wavelengths .",
    "this appears to be a result of deeper h@xmath1o absorption in d0211 .",
    "( 3 ) there is a marginally significant absorption feature at 2.200@xmath70.002 @xmath0 m in the spectrum of d0211 that is slightly offset from the nai doublet at 2.206 and 2.209 @xmath0 m .",
    "this absorption feature was also observed by delfosse et al .",
    "a detailed spectral model is needed to confirm the identity of this absorption feature .",
    "there are no atomic lines listed by jones et al .",
    "( 1994 ) that are clearly seen in our spectra .",
    "( 4 )  there are perhaps many weak absorption features throughout the spectrum .",
    "the reality of these features requires both modeling and additional spectra for confirmation .",
    "we can not rely on standard signal - to - noise arguments in assessing the reality of these weak features because of the detector array problem mentioned in  2 .",
    "figure 2 shows the comparison of d0211 to other low - temperature objects kelu-1 and gd165b .",
    "the spectra were arbitrarily normalized at 2.07 @xmath0 m .",
    "this wavelength was chosen as it is intermediate between the maximum of the h@xmath1o and the h@xmath1 absorption bands .",
    "spectra of the latter two objects were taken from ruiz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and jones et al .",
    "kelu-1 is another recently discovered field brown dwarf with detected li absorption ( ruiz et al .",
    "gd165b is an unusual low - temperature object and is a likely brown dwarf ( kirkpatrick , henry , & liebert 1993 , jones et al .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to observe the li absorption line at 670.8 nm in this object because of strong scattered light from the primary star .",
    "note the strong similarity of the spectrum of both kelu-1 and gd165b .",
    "as in the comparison to d1015 and d1215 , the spectra of kelu-1 and gd165b are different from that of d0211 by having relatively higher flux density at 1.92.0 @xmath0 m and at 2.152.30 @xmath0 m .    figure 3 shows the comparison of d0211 to d1015 and gl229b .",
    "the spectra shown in figure 3 seem to imply a progression of deeper h@xmath1 and ch@xmath8 absorption , with the spectrum of d0211 being intermediate between that of d1015 and gl229b .",
    "this suggests that the effective temperature of d0211 is less than d1015 , a result consistent with that of tinney et al .",
    "we note that the 1.92.5 @xmath0 m spectrum of d1015 is very similar to that of vb 10 , an m8 v spectral type star , at 1.92.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "however these objects are known to have significant spectral differences at 0.650.90 @xmath0 m ( tinny et al .",
    "therefore the 1.92.5 @xmath0 m spectrum alone is not sufficient to precisely classify objects .",
    "nonetheless , we show in the next section that the 1.92.5  @xmath0 m spectrum may be sufficient to enable a rough classification of objects and to identify brown dwarfs .",
    "compared to the other objects , the spectrum d0211 exhibits a broad and shallow dip at 2.2  @xmath0 m ( see the comparison in figure 3 ) . we believe this broad absorption is caused by h@xmath1 absorption based on a comparison of our spectra to atmospheric models of low - mass objects calculated by t. tsuji ( 1998 ) .",
    "these models show that h@xmath1 is the major absorber in this spectral region and that ch@xmath8 is a minor absorber for an effective temperature of about 1800 k. this is consistent with ruiz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who indicate that h@xmath1 is the main cause of the absorption at 2.2  @xmath0 m in the brown dwarf kelu1 ( see their fig .",
    "additional modeling is needed to determine the best fitting parameters for d0211 , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "note that delfosse et al .",
    "( 1997 ) attribute the dip at 2.2 @xmath0 m to ch@xmath8 , and as a result they estimate the effective temperature to be about 1500  k. however no support for this interpretation was presented , and we assume our effective temperature estimate in this paper .",
    "the comparison of d0211 to various objects leads to the question of whether a crude type of classification of objects might be possible using the shape of the spectrum .",
    "we define two parameters as follows :    @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the average flux density in the wavelength range @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the label `` @xmath2 '' is used because the spectra used are in the photometric @xmath2-band .",
    "these definitions are similar to those of steele et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the 2.1 @xmath0 m slope with the exception that we base our definition based on f@xmath14 versus wavelength in microns instead of f@xmath15 versus wavelength .",
    "we also define the denominator to be the average instead of the sum .",
    "@xmath16 measures the rise of the spectrum from 2.0 to 2.14 @xmath0 m , and this is primarily affected by the amount of h@xmath1o absorption .",
    "@xmath17 measures the amount of absorption between 2.14 and 2.24 @xmath0 m that is caused by h@xmath1 .",
    "for extremely low - effective temperature objects , @xmath17 will be sensitive to the amount of ch@xmath8 as well . in d0211 , d1015 , and d1215",
    "the k2 index is influenced primarily by the amount of h@xmath1 absorption while in an extremely cool object such as gl229b it is affected primarily by ch@xmath8 .",
    "this results from the overlapping absorption of h@xmath1 and ch@xmath8 absorption bands at about 2.2 @xmath0 m . as a result",
    ", there should be a gradual transition in the index as one goes from objects with an effective temperature of about 1800 k to cooler temperatures .",
    "therefore the @xmath18 plot should be a good indicator of the temperature of the object .",
    "values of k1 and k2 for various low - mass objects are shown in table 2 and in figure  4 .",
    "we can see that cooler objects tend to be located toward the lower right of figure 4 .",
    "kelu-1 and d12 - 15 have strong li absorption at 670.8 nm and are therefore considered to be confirmed brown dwarfs . d0211 and gd165b are considered to be likely brown dwarfs and are located at @xmath16 @xmath19 0.11 .",
    "the status of d1015 , whether a brown dwarf or not is unclear .",
    "several trends can be noted in table 2 and figure 4 .",
    "first , from warmest to coolest the denis objects have been previously ranked as d1015 , d1215 , and d0211 by tinney et al .",
    "this is consistent with the trend seen in the k index plot where these objects progress to larger k1 index and smaller k2 index with lower effective temperature ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "this is easily seen as the result of deeper h@xmath1o and h@xmath1 absorption with lower effective temperature .",
    "second , gl229b characterized by an extremely negative k2 index but with a k1 index which is typical of much warmer objects .",
    "we therefore expect that the k2 index to be more important in distinguishing objects cooler than d0211 .    with more objects",
    ", it may be possible to establish a relationship between the effective temperature of the object and the position on the @xmath18 plot . at the present time",
    "the effective temperatures for d1015 , d1215 , and d0211 are very uncertain .",
    "detailed models , such as those presented by tsuji et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , is needed to establish the effective temperatures of these objects . until this is accomplished ,",
    "the effective temperatures of these objects should be treated with a great deal of caution . in the case of d0211",
    ", the effective temperature is estimated to be about 1800 k but not as cool as 1500 k. note that atmospheric models of brown dwarfs have effective temperature uncertainties of 100200  k ( ruiz et al .",
    "1997 , tsuji et al .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind that dust formation is an important factor in these atmospheric models ( jones & tsuji 1997 ; tsuji et al .",
    "this adds further complication in seeking a straightforward interpretation using the k index .",
    "our narrowband photometry provides the more precise information on the continuum level of these objects compared to that presented by delfosse et al .",
    "compared to broadband photometry , the narrowband data is largely unaffected by the h@xmath1o absorption because it is centered on the continuum and it is insensitive to color transformation uncertainties that exist in broadband photometric observations .",
    "figure 5 shows the photometry and a comparison to blackbody curves and to broadband photometry . because of the strong h@xmath1o absorption bands , the broadband magnitudes are 0.10.4 mag lower than the narrowband magnitudes .",
    "although a single color temperature can fit the 13.8 @xmath0 m photometry , there is little physical significance to the color temperature because these objects do not radiate like blackbodies .",
    "models by tsuji et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show the extremely nonblackbody emission of low - temperature objects . in addition one",
    "can see in figure 5 that a single blackbody fails to match the 0.79 @xmath0 m point .",
    "from our 1.92.5 @xmath0 m spectra and narrowband photometry , we conclude :    \\1 .",
    "a simple two - parameter spectral slope analysis shows promise as a means of estimating the effective temperature of low - mass objects ( see fig .",
    "brown dwarfs are likely to have @xmath16 @xmath19 0.25 .      \\3 .",
    "we present accurate accurate narrowband photometry in the continuum for the first time",
    ". this will provide better constraints on models of very low mass objects , especially in providing an estimate of the effective temperature .",
