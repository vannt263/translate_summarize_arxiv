    "traditionally , analyses of spreading dynamics start with a deterministic approximation of the selective and dispersal dynamics  ignoring both stochasticity and the discreteness of individuals .",
    "to setup consideration of the actual stochastic dynamics , we first give results in this deterministic approximation and show that these exhibit hints of why they break down .",
    "when the jump rate decreases exponentially or faster with distance , the spread is _ qualitatively _ similar to simple diffusive dispersal and the extent of the mutant population expands linearly in time .",
    "however when the scale of the exponential fall - off is long , the speed , @xmath27 , is faster than the classic result for local dispersal , @xmath28 , which only depends on the diffusion coefficient , @xmath29 : instead , there is a characteristic range of jump distances determined by @xmath4 and @xmath3 that dominate the spread .",
    "as the dispersal range gets longer for fixed @xmath30 , the dominant jumps occur at lower rates suggesting that the stochasticity may become more important .    if @xmath3 has a long tail , in particular , @xmath6 , the spread in the deterministic approximation becomes exponentially fast with the radius of the region taken over by the mutant population , @xmath31 .",
    "this is almost as fast as in a fully mixed population , with the growth rate of the total mutant population size slower only by a factor of @xmath32 which approaches unity as @xmath33 , the point at which the spatial structure becomes irrelevant .",
    "the origin of this exponential growth for power - law @xmath3 is the deterministic feeding of the populations far away by jumps from near the origin : this immediately produces a finite population density at all distances , @xmath2 . after a time of order",
    "@xmath34 has passed , the exponential growth of the local population takes off , that is , further jumps to that region no longer matter . as in this time",
    "@xmath34 the expected total number of jumps to the _ whole _ region further than @xmath2 from the origin is only of order @xmath35 , the probability that _ any _ jumps have occurred is very small for large @xmath2 and the deterministic approximation must fail  @xcite .    with local dispersal , the deterministic approximation is a good starting point with only modest corrections to the expansion speed at high population density , the most significant effect of stochasticity being fluctuations in the speed of the front  @xcite . at the opposite extreme of jump rate independent of distance ,",
    "the deterministic approximation is also good with the mutant population growing as @xmath36 and fluctuations only causing stochastic variability and a systematic reduction in the coefficient which arise from early times when the population is small .",
    "surprisingly , in the regimes intermediate between these two , the deterministic approximation is not even qualitatively reasonable .",
    "we assume that , at long times , most of the sites are filled out to some distance scale @xmath8 and that the density decreases sufficiently steeply for larger distances , such that the total mutant population , @xmath37 , is proportional to @xmath38 .",

    "we call the crossover scale @xmath8 the _ core radius _ or  size \" of the mutant population .    in the dynamical regimes of interest , the core population grows primarily because it `` absorbs '' satellite clusters , which themselves were seeded by jumps from the core population .",
    "we now show that the rate of seeding of new mutant satellite clusters and the growth of the core populations by mergers with previously seeded clusters has to satisfy an iterative condition that enables us to determine the typical spreading dynamics of the mutant population .     to be occupied at time @xmath39 , a seed typically must become established somewhere in the blue space - time region ( `` target funnel '' ) by means of a long - range jump ( black arrow ) from the red  source \" region .",

    "further , we present in the appendix outlines of rigorous proofs of lower and upper bounds for the asymptotic growth laws in one dimension , including the slow crossovers near the marginal case . the linear growth for @xmath75 in one dimension has been proven by mollison  @xcite .",

    "asymptotic laws are of limited value without some understanding of their regime of validity , especially if the approach to the asymptotic behavior is slow . and such knowledge is crucially needed to interpret and make use of results from simulations .",

    "[ fig : scaling - plot - a ] ]      thus far we have considered spatially uniform systems , in which the jump probability between two points only depends on their separation",
    ". however , long distance transport processes may be very heterogeneous .",
    "an extreme example is airplane travel which occurs on a network of links between airports with mixtures of short and long distance flights , plus local transportation to and from airports .",
    "a simple model is to consider each site to have a number of connections from it , with the probability of a connection between each pair of sites a distance @xmath2 away being @xmath121 , independently for each pair : note that although the network is heterogeneous , statistically , the system is still homogeneous as the connection probability does not depend on position . if the rate at which jumps occur across a connection of length @xmath2 is @xmath122 , then , averaged over all pairs of sites , the rate of jumps of distance @xmath2 is @xmath123 .",
    "how similar is this to a homogeneous model with the same @xmath3 , in particular if @xmath6 ? if there are a large number of possible connections along which the key jumps can occur to get from a source region of size @xmath124 to a funnel of similar size a distance @xmath64 away , then the fact that these only occur to and from a small fraction of the sites should not matter for the large length scale behavior .",

    "thus the condition for our results to be valid asymptotically is that @xmath128 with @xmath129 the inverse of the function @xmath8 : i.e. , in the exponential , marginal , and power - law cases , respectively , that @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132",
    ".    if there are insufficient number of connections for the heterogeneity of the network to be effectively averaged over , the behavior changes .",

    "the difference between this result and ours is only in the power - law - of-@xmath40 pre - factor of @xmath64 arising from the integral over time : this does not exist in the extreme network limit . in the marginal case , @xmath73 , @xmath141 with @xmath142",
    "dependent on the coefficient of the power - law decay of the connection probability .",
    "if the probability of a jump along a long distance connection decays with distance but more slowly than @xmath143 , the behavior is similar : for @xmath67 again the ubiquitous stretched exponential behavior occurs , while for @xmath138 there are too few connections only if @xmath144 in which case the number of steps and the time are both proportional to the distance .",
    "the marginal cases we have not analyzed further .    for natural transport processes , the probabilities of long dispersal events will depend on both the source and the destination . if the heterogeneities are weak on large length scales , our results still obtain .",
    "but if there are sufficiently strong large scale heterogeneities , either in a spatial continuum or in the network structure ( i.e. location of nodes and links and the jump rates along these , or hub - spoke structure with multiple links from a small subset of sites ) , then the spatial spread will be heterogeneous even on large scales : how this reflects the underlying heterogeneities of the dispersal has to be analyzed on a case by case basis .",
    "we have studied the impact of long - range jumps on evolutionary spreading using the example of mutants that carry a favorable genetic variant .",
    "to this end , we analyzed a simple model in which long - range jumps lead to the continual seeding of new clusters of mutants , which themselves grow and send out more migrant mutants .",
    "the ultimate merging of these satellite clusters limits the overall growth of the mutant population , and it is a balance of seeding and merging of sub - clusters that controls the spreading behavior .    to classify the phenomena emerging from this model , we focussed on jump distributions that exhibit a power law tail .",
    "we found that , with power law jumps , four generic behaviors are possible on sufficiently long times : the effective radius of the mutant population grows either at constant speed , as a super - linear power law of time , as a stretched exponential , or simply exponentially depending on the exponent , @xmath145 , of the power law decay of the jump probability .",
    "these predictions are in contrast to deterministic approximations that predict exponential growth for power - law decaying jump kernels @xcite . in dimensions more than one ,",
    "the results also contradict the naive expectation from dynamics of neutral dispersal , that a finite diffusion coefficient is sufficient for conventional behavior ( in this context , finite speed of spreading ) : specifically , for @xmath146 , @xmath147 but the spread is super - linear  indeed stretched exponential for @xmath148 . that super - linear dynamics can occur for @xmath149 is not surprising as even a migrating individual undergoes a levy flight",
    ": more surprising is that this occurs even when the dynamics of individuals is , on large scales , like a normal random walk .",
    "the breakdowns of both deterministic and diffusive expectations are indicative of the importance of fluctuations : the dynamics is dominated by very rare  but not too rare  jumps : roughly , the most unlikely that occur at all up to that time . one of the consequences of this control by the rare jumps is the relatively minor role played by the selective fitness advantage , @xmath4 , of the mutants . with short - range dispersal ,",
    "the speed is @xmath150 , and for global dispersal , @xmath151 .",
    "by contrast , in the regime of power law growth , the asymptotic growth of the mutant population becomes ( to leading order ) independent of the speed of the growth of individual clusters although when individual clusters grow more slowly , the asymptotic regime is reached at a later time . in the stretched exponential regime , the growth of sub - clusters sets the cross - over time from linear to stretched exponential , and thus determines the pre - factor in the power law that characterizes the logarithm of the mutant population size .",
    "an important feature of our results is that the approach to the asymptotic laws is very slow in the vicinity of the marginal cases , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] . consider for instance the two - dimensional case , where we have asymptotically stretched exponential growth for @xmath149 : for @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) , the epidemics has to run for times @xmath154 @xmath155 to reach the asymptotic regime . by that time , however , the mutant population with @xmath156 @xmath157 would have certainly spread over the surface of the earth . to describe the full cross - over dynamics",
    ", we developed an approximate recurrence relation based on the geometric source - funnel argument described in the illustration fig .",
    "[ fig : funnel - antifunnel ] .",
    "this predicts a universal cross - over function for the transient dynamics near @xmath73 that can be uncovered by simulations for different power law exponents collapsed onto one scaling plot , c.f .",

    "the rigorous bounds whose proofs are outlined in the si sec .",

    "understanding this crossover is essential for making sense of , and extrapolating from , simulations as asymptotic behavior is not visible until enormous system sizes even when the exponent @xmath7 is more than @xmath158 from its marginal value .",
    "another benefit of the ability of the simple iterative scaling argument to capture well non - asymptotic behavior , is that it can be used in cases in which the dispersal spectrum of jumps is not a simple power - law , e.g. with a crossover from one form to another as a function of distance . and the heuristic picture that it gives rise to  an exponential hierarchy of time scales separated by roughly factors of two",
    " is suggestive even in more complicated situations . that such a structure should emerge without a hierarchal structure of the underlying space or dynamics",
    "is perhaps surprising .",
    ", the spreading dynamics exhibits three behaviors . on",
    "asymptotically large times , either stretched exponential growth for @xmath159 or superlinear power law growth for @xmath160 occurs .",
    "however , the approach to the asymptotic regime is extremely slow for @xmath7 close to @xmath0 . for log - times @xmath161 ,",
    "the behavior is controlled by the dynamics of the marginal case .",
    "note that cross - over behavior also obtains near to the borderline between linear and super - linear behavior at @xmath162 , cf .",
    "s2  b. ]      our primary aim biologically is the qualitative and semi - quantitative understanding that emerges from consideration of the simple models and analyses of these , especially demonstrating how rapid spatial spread of beneficial mutations or other biological novelty can be even with very limited long - range dispersal .",
    "as the models do not depend on any detailed information about the biology or dispersal mechanisms , they can be considered as a basic null model for spreading dynamics in _ physical _ , rather than more abstract network , space .",
    "the empirical literature suggests that power - law spectra of spatial dispersal are wide - spread in the biological world  @xcite . although these are surely neither a constant power - law over a wide range of scales , nor spatially homogeneous , our detailed results are not directly applicable .",
    "but , as discussed above , our iterative scaling argument is more general and can be applied with more complicated distance dependence , anisotropy , etc .",
    "furthermore , some of the heterogeneities of the dispersal will be averaged out for the overall spread , while affecting when mutants are likely to arrive at particular locations .    for dispersal via hitchhiking on human transport , either of pathogens or of commensals such as fruit flies with food , the apparent heterogeneities are large because of the nature of transportation networks , although data suggest that dispersal of humans can be reasonably approximated by power - law jumps  @xcite .",
    "whether or not transport via a network with hubs at many scales fundamentally changes the dynamics of an expanding population of hitchhikers from that with more homogeneous jump processes , depends on the nature of how the population expands .    for spread of a human epidemic",
    ", there are several possible scenarios .",
    "if the human population is reasonably uniform spatially , and the chances that a person travels from , say , their home to another person s home is primarily a function of the distance between these rather than the specific locations , then whether or not the properties of the transportation network matter depends on features of the disease .",
    "if individuals are infectious for the whole time the outbreak lasts and if transmission is primarily at end points of journeys rather than enroute  for example hiv  then the transportation network plays no role except to provide the spatial jumps . at the other extreme but still within an si model , is if individuals living near hubs are more likely to travel ( or even if destinations near hubs are more likely ) , and , more so , if infections are likely to occur enroute , in which case the structure of the transportation network  as well as of spectra of city sizes , etc  matters a great deal . in between these limits the network ( or lack of it in places ) may matter for initial local spread but at longer times the network structure may effectively average out and the dynamics be more like the homogeneous models .",
    "the two opposite limits and behavior in between these , together with the specific network model we analyzed with jumping probabilities depending on distance even in the presence of a connection  as is true from airports  all illustrate an important point : geometrical properties of networks alone rarely determine their properties : quantitative aspects , such as probabilities of moving along links and what exists at the nodes , are crucial .",
    "more complicated epidemic models can be discussed within the same framework : the model discussed thus far corresponds to an si model , the most basic epidemic model , which consists of susceptible and infected individuals only .",
    "many important epidemics are characterized by rather short infectious periods , so that one has to take into account the transition from infected to recovered : sir models .",
    "this changes fundamentally the geometry of our space time analysis , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : funnel - antifunnel ] . while the target funnel",
    "remains a full funnel , the source funnel becomes hollow : the center of the population consists mostly of fully recovered individuals , whose long - range jumps are irrelevant .",
    "the relevant source population of infected individuals is primarily near the boundaries of the funnel .",

    "<S> while evolutionary spread with long - range jumps has been simulated stochastically in a number of biological contexts  @xcite , few analytic results have been obtained on the ensuing stochastic dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most analyses have resorted to deterministic approximations  @xcite , which are successful for describing both the local and global dispersal limits . yet , in between these extreme limits , stochasticity drastically changes the spreading dynamics of the mutant population . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly striking when the probability of jumps decays as a power - law of the distance . </S>",
    "<S> just such a distance spectrum of dispersal is characteristic of various biological systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the behavior is controlled by a balance between the rarity and the potential effectiveness of long distance jumps and the whole spectrum of jump distances can matter . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper is to develop the theory of stochastic spreading dynamics when the dispersal is neither short range nor global .    </S>",
    "<S> long distance dispersal can occur either on a fixed network , or more homogeneously in space . for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the completely homogeneous case , and then show that many of the results also apply for an inhomogeneous transportation network with hubs between which the long distance jumps occur . for definiteness , we consider for most of the paper the evolutionary scenario of the spread of a single beneficial mutation , but , by analogy , the results can be applied to other contexts , such as the spread of infectious disease or of invasive species .          the underlying model of spatial spread of a beneficial mutant is a population in a @xmath0-dimensional space with local competition that keeps the population density constant at @xmath1 and with a probability that any individual jumps to any particular point a distance @xmath2 away of @xmath3 per time per area , per length or per volume . at a very low rate , mutants can appear that have a selective advantage , @xmath4 , over the original population . </S>",
    "<S> a lattice version of this model is more convenient for simulations ( and for aspects of the analysis ) : each lattice site represents a  deme \" with fixed population size , @xmath5 with the competition only within a deme and the jump migration between demes . </S>",
    "<S> initially , a single mutant occurs and if , as occurs with probability proportional to @xmath4 , it survives stochastic drift to establish , it will take over the local population . when the total rate of migration between demes is much slower than this local sweep time , </S>",
    "<S> the spatial spread is essentially from demes that are all mutants to demes that are all the original type .    </S>",
    "<S> short jumps result in a mutant population that spreads spatially at a roughly constant rate . </S>",
    "<S> but with long - range jumps , new mutant populations are occasionally seeded far away from the place where they came , and these also grow . </S>",
    "<S> the consequences of such long jumps is the key issue that we need to understand . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see , the interesting behaviors occur when the jump rate has a power - law tail at long distances , specifically , with @xmath6 ( with positive @xmath7 needed for the total jump rate to be finite ) . </S>",
    "<S> crudely , the behavior can be divided into two types : linear growth of the radius of the region that the mutants have taken over , and faster than linear growth . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : illustrate - sweep - dynamics ] , these two behaviors are illustrated via simulations on two dimensional lattices . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the mutant - occupied region at several times , shown are some of the longest jumps that occur and the clusters of occupied regions that grow from these . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : illustrate - sweep - dynamics]a , there are no jumps that are of comparable length to the size of the mutant region at the time at which they occur , and the rate of growth of the characteristic linear size @xmath8 of the mutant region  loosely its radius  is roughly constant in time , i.e. @xmath9 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : illustrate - sweep - dynamics]b and c , @xmath10 is longer range and very long jumps are observed . </S>",
    "<S> these result in faster - than linear growth of the radius of the mutant region , as shown . before developing analytic predictions for the patterns of evolutionary spread , </S>",
    "<S> we report our simulation results in detail . </S>"
