    "oh masers have long been associated with the early stages of star formation .",
    "models of maser pumping mechanisms allow constraints to be set on the physical conditions in the region of the maser . by understanding the conditions associated with oh masers , the conditions in regions of star formation can be delineated .",
    "many models have been developed for pumping mechanisms for the ground state ( 18 cm wavelength ) lines ; a number of the models have been extended to excited state masers .",
    "one of these excited states is the @xmath0 .",
    "the most commonly detected line from this state is the satellite f=@xmath2 transition at 4765 mhz .",
    "although there are several models for emission from this state ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) , these models are not entirely satisfactory .",
    "detailed observations are required including higher spatial resolution and absolute position determinations .",
    "previous studies with increasing accuracies have shown many instances of spatial coincidence between 1720 mhz ground state masers and 4765 mhz masers ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ( hereafter gcryf ) ) .",
    "the possible spatial overlap has been an important factor in recent pumping models . in particular , the study of gcryf with merlin provided the first absolute positions of 4765 mhz and 1720 mhz masers in w3(oh ) . to within the uncertainties ( estimated to be 5 mas at 4765 mhz and 15 mas at 1720 mhz )",
    ", they found that in two of three fields the positions of the two masers agreed .",
    "in addition , they compared angular sizes of 1720 mhz masers @xcite to those of accompanying 4765 mhz masers and found that the 4765 mhz masers are considerably larger , implying a smaller gain at the higher frequency .    another important feature of 4765 mhz masers is their polarization properties .",
    "theoretically , if polarization of molecular emission lines arises from magnetic effects , these lines should be unpolarized because the land g - factor of this state is @xmath10 @xcite . probably because because polarization is not expected , little observational effort has been expended to measure polarization of these lines . to date polarization",
    "has been detected in only one source . during a spectacular flare , the 4765 mhz maser in monr2",
    "was found to be 15% linearly polarized @xcite .",
    "amplification of an unseen polarized background source was a suggested cause .",
    "recently , @xcite obtained upper limits for polarization in a survey of southern star - forming regions .",
    "the most stringent limits for the 16 sources in which 4765 mhz emission was detected were @xmath34% linear and @xmath35% circular .",
    "spatial coincidence with maser emission in other oh transitions , angular size measurements , and polarization all provide information about possible pumping mechanisms in these masers .",
    "furthermore , existing models for 4765 mhz emission focus largely on w3(oh ) . by observing a number of other sources , we are able to examine whether these models are more generally applicable .    in this paper",
    "we report vlba observations of 4765 mhz masers in w3(oh ) , dr21ex , and k3 - 50 as well as negative results for w49 and w75n .",
    "we also provide a preliminary report of vlba observations of 1720 mhz emission in w3(oh ) .    depending on the availability of a nearby reference source",
    ", the vlba observations were made using phase - referencing .",
    "phase - referencing serves two important purposes in this study : first , this technique provides a good initial phase correction so that narrow , relatively weak maser lines ( peak flux densities @xmath31 jy ) can be imaged with the vlba ; second , this technique permits absolute position determinations .",
    "this experiment improves previous investigations for the following reasons : 1 ) the synthesized beam of the vlba is about an order of magnitude smaller that the merlin beam , 2 ) we measured all four stokes parameters for 4765 mhz masers , and 3 ) we observed additional sources .",
    "all 4765 mhz observations were carried out using the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) very long baseline array ( vlba ) in 2000 december 23 ( w3(oh ) ) and 2001 february 19 and 24 ( k3 - 50 , dr21ex , w75n , and w49 ) . observations of the latter sources were interleaved over the two days to optimize hour angle coverage .",
    "phase - referencing on nearby calibrators was used for w3(oh ) and k3 - 50 : scans of 3 minutes duration were made on a target source followed by 2 minute duration observations of the nearby reference source ( see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) . because of the current paucity of calibrators near the galactic plane , phase - referencing could not be used for w49 , w75n , and dr21ex . however , because dr21ex has some very strong features , these could be used as the phase - reference calibrator to determine phase corrections for w75n ( although , of course not for the absolute position ) . for dr21ex and w75n ,",
    "3 minute scans were made on each .",
    "ten antennas were used in all observations : either all vlba antennas or ( in december ) one antenna from the very large array ( vla ) was substituted for the pie town antenna .",
    "data was taken in 128 spectral channels spaced by 3.91 khz in all four polarization combinations . with uniform weighting of the spectrum",
    ", this resulted in a velocity resolution of 0.29 km s@xmath4 across @xmath132 km s@xmath4 from which all four stokes parameters could be imaged .",
    "when phase - referencing was used , the accuracy of the absolute positions reported here is dominated by residual effects which were not removed by phase - referencing .",
    "this error is estimated to be @xmath51 mas at 6 cm .",
    "this error is dominant when comparing our results to those of others or our results at 4765 mhz to those at 1720 mhz .",
    "the relative errors for positions at the same frequency in the same source are determined by thermal noise and are @xmath10.1 mas for all reported measurements .",
    "the 1720 mhz observations of w3(oh ) were carried out with the vlba on 2002 july 31 .",
    "all 10 antennas of the vlba were used .",
    "phase - referencing was used with the same cycle as used for the 4765 mhz observations w3(oh ) .",

    "that is , @xmath60 inserting appropriate constants for this transition and @xmath61=3 khz ( @xmath10.2 km s@xmath4 , corresponding to the narrow lines observed with the vlba ) , equation(1 ) becomes : @xmath62 to express @xmath57 in terms of the total density of molecular gas , we write : @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is the inversion efficiency ( @xmath65 ; @xcite ) , @xmath66 is the fraction of oh molecules in the @xmath0 state , f is the fractional abundance of oh compared to h@xmath67 , and the factor 1/2 is present because the population of the state is approximately equally distributed among the sub - levels of the four hyperfine levels at plausible temperatures and inversion fractions .",
    "we express the pathlength in au , and obtain : @xmath68 for temperatures between 50  200 k , @xmath66 is in the range 0.03  0.1 , and @xmath64 is estimated to lie in the range 0.01  0.1 . taking the geometric mean of possible values of the product , @xmath69 = 1.3 10@xmath70 , we obtain : @xmath71 for an oh abundance fraction f@xmath72 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , we obtain : @xmath73 there is little doubt that the product @xmath69 has an uncertainty of less than an order of magnitude . while f is at the upper end of possible values for relative abundance of oh to h@xmath67 in the interstellar medium ( i.e. within a factor of a few of the total o abundance ) , all models for oh masers to date",
    "have invoked an increased oh fractional abundance .",
    "the brightness temperature of the background is @xmath3 10  k for the 4765 mhz masers reported in this paper .",
    "therefore , in order to produce @xmath74  k , a minimum gain corresponding to @xmath75 20 is required .",
    "while the brightness temperatures are typically a factor of 10 less than is typical for oh masers @xcite , these values of @xmath44 still lead to rather severe constraints on parameters of the region . from equation ( 7 )",
    "we find : @xmath76 therefore if @xmath77 is to be less than the diameter of the entire 4765 mhz maser region ( taken to be 10@xmath78 au ) we require n@xmath79  @xmath53 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the pathlength were comparable to the spot sizes ( @xmath110 au ) , required densities would be increased by a factor of @xmath1100 .",
    "we regard such a density as implausible ( see also next paragraph ) .",
    "the density required can be reduced by a factor of 10 if the product @xmath69 were taken to be at the extreme high end of the plausible range ; however , the density would be increased by a factor of 10 if the product were at the low end .",
    "( the required density would be increased by another factor of 10 if the oh abundance were similar to that found in quiescent , low density regions of molecular clouds . )",
    "the small measured transverse extent of each feature together with the @xmath1100 times greater pathlength along the line of sight inferred from limits on the density leads to the conclusion that the maser region is filamentary with the long direction pointed toward the observer .",
    "such a structure also relieves the constraint on saturation derived above since @xmath43 would be greatly reduced .",
    "these filaments need not be geometric structures , but may simply be lines of sight through the much larger region in which the velocity coherence is greatest .",
    "such an interpretation fits naturally with the very narrow line widths detected with the vlba . where velocity coherence does not exist",
    ", lower brightness emission may be produced .",
    "while many models for oh masers have been developed in the last 30 years , parity assignments for @xmath80-doublet levels of oh were incorrect until 1984 , and collision cross sections before 1994 were significantly discrepant compared with the best current values @xcite .",
    "therefore , we primarily consider models developed since 1994 .",
    "first , we compare the density limit derived above for the 4765 mhz maser region with that derived from consideration of the 1720 mhz line .",
    "@xcite find that the 1720 mhz maser is quenched by collisions at densities above @xmath15 10@xmath18@xmath53 .",
    "therefore the density estimate derived above ( 10@xmath81 @xmath53 ) can be compatible with 1720 mhz emission arising in the same physical region as 4765 mhz emission only if the density is near its lower limit . @xcite",
    "have explicitly discussed the production of the 4765 mhz line and find no range of conditions in which simultaneous production of 4765 mhz and 1720 mhz masers can occur . in an earlier detailed model , @xcite can obtain coincidence of the 4765 mhz and 1720 mhz region with a density 2 10@xmath34  @xmath53 in an accelerating flow .",
    "apparently , radiative pumping in the flow is sufficient to overcome quenching ; then the accelerating flow prevents the optical depth in the far ir lines connecting the @xmath82 and @xmath0 states from becoming large enough to quench the 1720 mhz maser . because of the difficulty other models encounter finding physical conditions in which 1720 mhz and 4765 mhz emission both arise , further work on this model is desirable to verify if the results are qualitatively similar based on more recent collision cross sections .",
    "a model using these recent collision cross sections was developed for 1720 mhz emission near supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "this model also explains the enhanced oh abundance in a natural way . in this model , oh is formed behind a c - shock surrounding the supernova remnant .",
    "however , 4765 mhz emission is not explicitly discussed . in regions",
    "in which 4765 mhz emission is detected , there are certainly shocks caused by molecular outflows .",
    "however , these shocks are expected to be j - shocks .",
    "if a transverse magnetic field is present , an initial j - shock evolves into a c - shock ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the 5  10 mg magnetic fields found in the 1720 mhz observations are suggestive of c - shocks ( see table  [ tab:4765vs1720 ] ) .",
    "a requirement for future progress is the development of models for the 4765 mhz masers similar to the @xcite models for 1720 mhz masers .",
    "these new models must use the improved collision cross sections and treat the transfer of the infrared lines which connect 1720 mhz and 4765 mhz lines .    in w3(oh )",
    "we confirmed with higher positional accuracy ( @xmath3 5 mas ) the agreement between the 4765 mhz and 1720 mhz maser positions .",
    "we also showed that to within vla accuracy ( @xmath10.2 ) , there are 1720 mhz masers in the region of 4765 mhz emission in dr21ex . there are no known 1720 mhz features in the field 1 of w3(oh ) and the k3 - 50 sources .",
    "we also detected no polarization for any of the 4765 mhz features .",
    "upper limits in the best cases are @xmath13% ( 4@xmath10 ) .",
    "vla observations of k3 - 50 at 1720 mhz should be done to confirm the absence of a 1720 mhz maser at that location . also , it is important to determine absolute positions for both 4765 mhz emission and 1720 mhz emission from dr21ex .",
