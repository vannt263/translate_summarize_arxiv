    "noise - induced synchonization  @xcite is an ubiquitous phenomenon in nonlinear science .",
    "it arises as the interplay between determined and random dynamics  @xcite , with both the synchronization and noise influence being recently the subjects of considerable interest of scientific community .",
    "indeed , on the one hand the synchronous behavior of nonlinear systems has attracted great attention of researchers for a long time  @xcite . on the other hand discovering the fact that fluctuations can actually induce some degree of order in a large variety of nonlinear systems is one of the most surprising results of the last decades in the field of stochastic processes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , both these phenomena are relevant for physical , chemical , biological and other systems described in terms of nonlinear dynamics ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "noise - induced synchronization ( nis ) means that the random signal influencing two identical uncoupled dynamical chaotic systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( starting from the different initial conditions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) results in their synchronous ( i.e. , identical ) behavior @xmath5 after transient finished",
    ".    noise - induced synchronization can be detected by means of direct comparison of the states of two chaotic systems , @xmath0 , and , @xmath1 , being under the influence of noise .",
    "the other method of diagnostics of nis is calculating the largest lyapounov exponent ( le ) of dynamical system that measures the stability of the motion .",
    "indeed , in driven chaotic system the largest lyapunov exponent may become negative , that results in synchronization : both systems forced by the same noise `` forget '' their initial conditions and evolve to identical state  @xcite . if the noise influence is infinitely small the largest lyapunov exponent is positive for such a system .    in all cases of the noise - induced synchronization being known hitherto the boundary of the noise - induced synchronization regime",
    "is associated with the point on the parameter axis where the largest lyapunov exponent of the system under study crosses the zero value when its sign is changed from `` plus '' to `` minus '' . in this paper",
    "we report for the first time that the noise - induced synchronization regime of two spatially extended uncoupled identical systems driven by common noise may be preceded by a new type of behavior , when the largest lyapunov exponent remains zero in a finite range of parameter values .",
    "this kind of behavior called _ `` incomplete noise induced synchronization '' _ ( inis ) demonstrates the features of the synchronous motion of two uncoupled identical systems driven by common noise : although the states of the system differ , trajectories can be transformed into each other by an appropriate spatial shift .",

    "the difference of the states of both systems in every point of space tends to be zero ( after transient ) , which means the presence of the noise - induced synchronization regime .",

    "the relation @xmath31 takes place , since in this case the difference between the states of two identical spatially extended systems ( [ eq : g - l_noise ] ) in every point of space tends to zero .",
