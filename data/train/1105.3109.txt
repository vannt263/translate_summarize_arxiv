    "these ratios are expected to be mostly sensitive to interactions of the @xmath0 and its decay daughters with the produced dense matter .",
    "the decrease of the ratios suggests a substantial duration of the hadronic stage of the fireball . * the urqmd model , although including rescattering of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and their decay daughters in the hadronic phase , is not able to provide a quantitative description of @xmath0 production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at sps energies .",
    "* yields of @xmath0 mesons in central pb+pb collisions are about a factor of 2.5 below the predictions of the statistical hadron gas model using parameters fitted to the yields of stable hadrons .    in summary , the predicted suppression of @xmath0 yields  @xcite was observed in central pb+pb collisions at the sps . it was found to be stronger at sps than at rhic energies .",
