    "regarding the production of strange baryons , the existing extensive studies on the production of @xmath4 and @xmath5 hyperons , which have strangeness @xmath6 , have accumulated many data for various physical quantities that are relevant for describing the production mechanisms of @xmath6 baryons and the parameters of nucleon resonances . by contrast , the production of multi - strangeness @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) baryons has not been studied very often .",
    "one reason is that the processes for producing multi - strangeness baryons from non - strangeness initial states have very small cross sections . as a result ,",
    "no significant information on multi - strangeness baryons has been added during the past two decades  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , the interest in multi - strangeness physics is increasing .",
    "for example , the major research programs at j - parc , which has started its operation recently , include strangeness physics  @xcite .",
    "since the j - parc facility can provide energetic kaon beams , the production of @xmath2 should be possible .",
    "furthermore , the planned upgrade of the kaon - beam energy will allow the production of @xmath0 resonances , thus providing a new turning point in the study of multi - strangeness baryons .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath9anda collaboration has a plan to investigate the @xmath10 reaction at fair  @xcite , and the clas collaboration at jlab has established the feasibility of investigating @xmath0 spectroscopy via photoproduction reactions like @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the reported data for the total and differential cross sections as well as the @xmath13 and @xmath14 invariant mass distributions for the @xmath11 reaction  @xcite are the first data measured for the exclusive photoproduction of the @xmath0 .",
    "recent theoretical investigations of this reaction can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the investigation of multi - strangeness baryons will shed light on our understanding of baryon structure by allowing us to distinguish various hadron models .",
    "( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . )",
    "however , this requires knowledge of the quantum numbers of the baryons since the spin and parity quantum numbers heavily depend on the internal structure of the baryons and the underlying dynamics .",
    "it is of crucial importance , therefore , to identify the quantum numbers of the observed @xmath0 baryons .",
    "however , identifying the spin and parity quantum numbers of multi - strangeness baryons is very challenging .",
    "for example , the fact that the @xmath15 baryon has spin-3/2 was only recently confirmed by experiment  @xcite , more than 40 years after the discovery of the @xmath16 baryon  @xcite . for the cascade baryons , only for three states , @xmath2 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , of the eleven cascade states reported in pdg  @xcite , the spin and parity quantum numbers are known . in a recent report  @xcite , the babar collaboration claimed that the @xmath19 has @xmath20 .",
    "what is surprising is that the parity of the cascade ground state @xmath2 has never actually been measured ; the positive parity quoted by the pdg  @xcite is taken from quark - model calculations .    in this article",
    ", we describe a novel , _ model - independent _ way to determine the parity of spin-1/2 @xmath0 baryons . to this end",
    ", we consider the reaction , @xmath21 , where the arguments @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 stand for the four - momenta of the respective particles . although the production mechanisms are highly model - dependent  @xcite , our method is based on bohr s theorem  @xcite and thus a direct consequence of the rotation and parity - inversion symmetries of the reaction amplitudes  @xcite , and , therefore , model - independent .",
    "furthermore , the cross section for this reaction is large enough to be measured experimentally .",
    "when the produced @xmath0 has spin-1/2 , the most general spin structure of the reaction amplitude constrained by symmetry principles for the reaction of @xmath3 can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , apply to @xmath0 having positive or negative parity .",
    "the amplitude functions @xmath29 are functions of mandelstam variables .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 are defined as @xmath32 , respectively . without loss of generality",
    ", we may choose the coordinate systems such that @xmath33 is the unit vector along the positive @xmath34-axis and @xmath31 along the positive @xmath35-axis so that @xmath30 is the unit vector along the positive @xmath36-axis .",
    "the reaction plane is then defined by the two vectors @xmath37 and @xmath30 .",
    "this enables us to write the reaction amplitudes in a generic manner as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath40 unit matrix . depending on the parity of @xmath0 , either @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "the unpolarized cross section is then given by @xmath43    the most interesting spin observable related to the parity of the @xmath0 is the ( diagonal ) spin - transfer coefficient @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 for @xmath46 . in terms of the cross sections ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath47 - \\left[d\\sigma_i^{}(+-)+d\\sigma_i^{}(-+)\\right ] } { \\left[d\\sigma_i^{}(++ ) + d\\sigma_i^{}(--)\\right ] + \\left[d\\sigma_i^{}(+-)+d\\sigma_i^{}(-+)\\right ] }   , \\label{eq:4a}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 stands for the differential cross section with the polarization of the target nucleon and of the produced @xmath0 along the @xmath49-direction .",
    "the first and second @xmath50 arguments of @xmath48 indicate the parallel ( @xmath51 ) or anti - parallel ( @xmath52 ) spin - alignment along the @xmath49-direction of the target nucleon and produced @xmath0 , respectively .    the spin - transfer coefficient @xmath44 should be a function of the energy and scattering angle , in general .",
    "however , because of the spin structure of the amplitude , we can see that @xmath53 is constant and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the parity of the produced @xmath0 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the spin structures of the reaction amplitudes as exhibited in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , which is a realization of reflection symmetry in the reaction plane .",
    "therefore , the measurement of @xmath53 will directly determine the parity of the @xmath0 .    another way to determine",
    "the parity of spin-1/2 @xmath0 baryon is to use two single - polarization observables , namely , the target - nucleon asymmetry @xmath56 and the recoil-@xmath0 asymmetry @xmath57 , which are defined by @xmath58 + 2\\,\\mbox{im } \\left[m_j m^*_k \\right ] ,   \\\\ \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\omega}p_i & \\equiv & \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mbox{tr}\\left ( m m^\\dagger \\sigma_i \\right ) = 2\\,\\mbox{re}\\left[m_0m^*_i \\right ] - 2\\,\\mbox{im}\\left[m_j m^*_k \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath59 run cyclically . then the spin structures of the amplitudes of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) immediately give @xmath60 , \\qquad \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\omega}\\left ( t_y   - p_y\\right ) = 0   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for positive - parity @xmath0 and @xmath61,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for negative - parity @xmath0 .",
    "this can be used to determine the parity of the @xmath2 unless @xmath62 .",
    "in summary , we have studied the spin structure of the production amplitudes in the reaction of @xmath3 .",
    "we found that the spin - transfer coefficient @xmath53 , which is a double - polarization observable , can give a direct measurement of the parity of the @xmath0 baryon .",
    "furthermore , the combinations of the two single - polarization observables , the target asymmetry @xmath63 and the recoil asymmetry @xmath64 , can give another way to check the parity of the produced @xmath0 . since the @xmath0 is self - analyzing",
    ", these asymmetries can be measured by preparing polarized nucleon targets at the current facilities like the j - parc .",
    "although we considered the parity of spin-1/2 @xmath0 baryons in this article , our discussion can be generalized to the @xmath0 of higher spin and to the polarization observables in @xmath0 photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "similar relations can be found for the determination of the parity of the @xmath1 baryons as well .",
