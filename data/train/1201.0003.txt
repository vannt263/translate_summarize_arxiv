    "the standard model ( sm ) is minimal relativistic field theory , which is able to explain almost all particle physics experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , there are several observable facts , that can not be explained in the sm frame .",
    "firstly , the neutrinos of sm are strictly massless , that contradict to the experimental fact of the neutrinos oscillations @xcite .",
    "the second problem is the impossibility to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) within the sm .",
    "finally , the sm does not provide the dark matter ( dm ) candidate .",
    "also the sm can not solve the strong cp problem in particle physics , the primordial perturbations problem and the horizon problem in cosmology , etc .",
    "the solutions of the above mentioned problems of the sm require some new physics between the electroweak and the planck scales .",
    "an important challenge for the theoretical physics is to see if it is possible to solve them using only the extensions of the sm below the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "the neutrino minimal standard model ( @xmath0 ) is an extension of the sm by three massive right - handed neutrinos ( sterile neutrinos ) , which do not take part in the gauge interactions of the sm .",
    "the model was suggested by m. shaposhnikov and t. asaka @xcite .",
    "the masses of sterile neutrinos are predicted to be smaller than electroweak scale , and thus there is no new energy scale introduced in the theory .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath0 can be chosen in order to explain simultaneously the masses of active neutrinos , the nature of dm , and bau .",
    "the lightest sterile neutrino ( the mass is expected to be in the kev range @xcite ) can be intensively produced in the early universe and have cosmologically long life - time .",
    "so , it might be a viable dm candidate .",
    "the sufficient amount of this neutrinos can be generated through an efficient resonant mechanism proposed by shi and fuller @xcite .    in the @xmath0",
    "the required amount of the leptonic asymmetry ( in accordance with shi and fuller mechanism ) can be created due to decays of the two heavier sterile neutrinos .",
    "this particles are generated at temperature @xmath5 and their masses are expected to be in range @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath2 is the pion mass and @xmath7 is the mass of @xmath8-sterile neutrino . the leptonic asymmetry at the temperature of the sphaleron freeze - out ( @xmath9 ) is related to the baryon asymmetry of the universe . at temperature @xmath10 the leptonic asymmetry from decays of heavier sterile neutrinos can not convert into the baryon asymmetry and is accumulated . as it was shown in @xcite the required amount of the leptonic asymmetry",
    "@xmath11 : @xmath12 has to already exist in the universe at the moment of the beginning of production of the dm particles ( takes place at the temperature around 0.1 gev ) .",
    "we consider here the leptonic asymmetry generation at @xmath13 , when the masses of two heavier sterile neutrinos are between @xmath2 and 2 gev .",
    "the motivation is following .",
    "the mass of heavier sterile neutrino can not be less then @xmath2 ( the constraint is coming from accelerator experiments combined with big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) bounds @xcite ) and there is no direct experimental searches for singlet fermions with mass more then 2 gev @xcite .",
    "since the masses of active neutrinos in the @xmath0 are produced by the `` see - saw '' mechanism @xcite some constraints on the parameters of the @xmath0 come from active neutrino parameters that can be found from the experiments on the neutrino oscillations .",
    "namely , these are the mass squared differences of active neutrinos and the mixing angles . until recently the mixing angle @xmath14 was supposed to have a close to zero value .",
    "but new observations indicated its essential difference from zero @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to obtain constraints on the parameters of the @xmath0 from the required amount of the leptonic asymmetry and cosmology conditions .",
    "also we want to investigate the influence of non - zero mixing angle @xmath14 on space of the allowed parameters of the @xmath0 .",
    "we do it following @xcite using a simple model : we ignore the background effects and do computations at zero temperature .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ rozdil2 ]",
    "we present the lagrangian of the @xmath0 , make its convenient parametrization and present the yukawa couplings in terms of active neutrinos mass matrix parameters . in section [ rozdil3 ]",
    "we derive the expression for the leptonic asymmetry .",
    "the limitations on the @xmath0 parameters are imposed in section [ rozdil4 ] .",
    "section [ rozdil5 ] is devoted to the analysis and conclusions .",
    "in the @xmath0 @xcite the following terms are added to the lagrangian of the sm ( without taking into account the kinetic terms ) : @xmath15 where index @xmath16 corresponds to the active neutrino flavors , indices @xmath17 run from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , @xmath20 is for the lepton doublet of the left - handed particles , @xmath21 is for the field functions of the sterile right - handed neutrinos , the superscript @xmath22 means charge conjugation , @xmath23 is for the new ( neutrino ) matrix of the yukawa constants , @xmath24 is for the majorana mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos , @xmath25 is for the field of the higgs doublet , @xmath26 .",
    "after the spontaneous symmetry breaking the field of the higgs doublet in unitary gauge is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the neutral higgs field and the parameter @xmath29 determines minimum of the higgs field potential @xmath30 . in this case",
    "lagrangian acquires the dirac - majorana neutrino mass terms : @xmath31 or in conventional form @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 are square matrix of the third order with elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in zero approximation",
    "the @xmath0 lagrangian is assumed to be invariant under @xmath36 transformations , that provides preservation of the @xmath37 lepton numbers separately .",
    "it is also assumed that two heavier sterile neutrinos interact with the active neutrinos , but the third ( lightest ) sterile neutrino does not interact is a candidate for the dm particle . ] .",
    "this assumption can be realized by following matrix @xmath38@xcite : @xmath39    in this approximation we have two massive sterile neutrinos with equal mass @xmath40 , the third neutrino is massless , and all active neutrinos have zero mass .",
    "it contradicts observable data @xcite . to adjust it next small terms",
    "are added to the matrix @xmath38 @xcite : @xmath41    this correction violates @xmath36 symmetry , leads to the appearance of the mass of the third sterile neutrino and takes off the mass degeneracy for two heavier sterile neutrinos .",
    "it s also leads to the appearance of the extra small masses of the active neutrinos and nonzero mixing angles among them .    in the terms of the introduced corrections lagrangian",
    "is @xmath42 where @xmath43 are right - handed neutrinos in the gauge basis .    in order to find the masses of the active neutrino one has to make the diagonalization of the matrix @xmath38 .",
    "the diagonalization undergoes in two steps .",
    "firstly , @xmath38 matrix is reduced to the block - diagonal form via the unitary transformation @xcite in the `` see - saw '' approach : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the mass matrix of the active and sterile neutrinos respectively .",
    "now each block of the matrix @xmath38 may be diagonalized independently by the matrix @xmath48    the mass matrix of the active and sterile neutrinos is diagonalized by unitary transformation @xmath49 : @xmath50    there is a standard parametrization @xcite for @xmath49 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the three mixing angles ; @xmath55 is the dirac phase , and @xmath56 are the majorana phases .",

    "[ rozdil4 ]    as it was pointed in section [ intro ] , the leptonic asymmetry of the universe has to be constrained by condition at the moment of the beginning of the dm particles production .",
