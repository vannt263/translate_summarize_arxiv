    "typically first principles numerical simulations of field theories are done within the framework of the lattice regulator .",
    "a host of results have been produced in this way for many field theories and most notably qcd .",
    "several susy theories can also be formulated on the lattice and be studied numerically . to be more specific consider the problems of putting a susy theory on the lattice",
    "( see for example @xcite ) :    \\1 ) since space - time is discrete only a subgroup of the poincar group survives and as a result susy is broken .",

    "\\2 ) if the susy theory under consideration involves scalar fields one can have scalar mass terms that break susy since typically they are not forbidden by some symmetry . since these operators are relevant fine tuning will be needed in order to cancel their contributions .",

    "this results in the wrong number of degrees of freedom and therefore breaks susy .",
    "however , this problem may be possible to treat as in qcd .",
    "this is the case for @xmath0 sym .",
    "one possible way to remove the unwanted fermion degrees of freedom is to add an irrelevant operator ( wilson term @xcite ) that gives them heavy masses of the size of the cutoff .",
    "this term unavoidably breaks the chiral symmetry @xcite and as a result a gluino mass term is no longer forbidden .",
    "since such a term is relevant , fine tuning of the bare fermion mass is necessary as the continuum limit is approached in order to cancel its contribution .",
    "although fine tuning is not a welcomed property this method makes it possible to recover the continuum target theory .",
    "therefore , it is possible to simulate numerically the @xmath0 sym theory using existing lattice `` technology '' since all three difficulties can be circumvented .",
    "this observation was made some time ago @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was argued that , using a standard lattice gauge theory action with a pure gauge wilson plaquette term and wilson fermions in the adjoint representation , numerical simulations could be done .",
    "pioneering work using these methods has already produced very interesting numerical results @xcite . also , for proposed lattice tests of sym see @xcite .",
    "for a supersymmetric formulation on the lattice using kogut ",
    "susskind @xcite fermions see @xcite .",
    "there are two unwelcomed difficulties in using wilson fermions .",
    "the first has already been mentioned and it is the need for fine tuning .",
    "the second is of a technical nature .",
    "it turns out that the pfaffian resulting from the fermionic integration is not positive definite @xcite at finite lattice spacing .",
    "however , it does become positive definite as the continuum limit is approached and therefore as a `` cure '' only the absolute value of the pfaffian is used @xcite .",
    "however , this introduces non - analyticities that may make the approach to the continuum limit difficult .",
    "both of these difficulties can be brought under control by using an alternative fermion lattice regulator , domain wall fermions ( dwf ) .",
    "the use of dwf in supersymmetric theories has been explored in the very nice work of @xcite .",
    "the methods in this paper are along the lines of these references .",
    "domain wall fermions were introduced in @xcite , were further developed in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "they provide a new way for treating the unwelcomed chiral symmetry breaking that is introduced when the fermion doubler species are removed . here a variant of this approach will be used @xcite . for reviews on the subject",
    "please see @xcite and references therein .",
    "dwf have already been used for numerical simulations of the two flavor dynamical schwinger model @xcite , dynamical qcd @xcite , quenched qcd @xcite , as well as for simulations of 4-fermi models @xcite .",
    "the use of dwf in supersymmetric theories has also been explored in a different fashion in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the use of overlap @xcite type fermions has been explored in @xcite , and the use of other related types of fermions has been explored in @xcite .    in the lattice dwf formulation of a vector - like theory the fermionic fields",
    "are defined on a five dimensional space - time lattice using a local action .",
    "the fifth direction can be thought of as an extra space - time dimension or as a new internal flavor space .",
    "the gauge fields are introduced in the standard way in the four dimensional space - time and are coupled to the extra fermion degree of freedom in a diagonal fashion .",
    "the key ingredient is that the boundary conditions of the dirac operator along the fifth direction are taken to be free . as a result , although all fermions are heavy , two chiral , exponentially bound surface states appear on the boundaries ( domain walls ) with the plus chirality localized on one wall and the minus chirality on the other . the two chiralities mix only by an amount that is exponentially small in @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the number of lattice sites along the fifth direction , and form a dirac spinor that propagates in the four - dimensional space - time with an exponentially small mass",
    "therefore , the amount of chiral symmetry breaking that is artificially induced by the regulator can be controlled by the new parameter @xmath3 . in the @xmath4",
    "limit the chiral symmetry is exact , even at finite lattice spacing , so there is no need for fine - tuning .",
    "for the first time the approach to the chiral limit has been separated from the approach to the continuum limit .",
    "furthermore , the computing requirement is linear in @xmath3 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with traditional lattice fermion regulators where the chiral limit is approached only as the continuum limit is taken , a process that is achieved at a large computing cost . specifically , because of algorithmic reasons , the computing cost to reduce the lattice spacing by a factor of two grows by a factor of @xmath5 in four dimensions .",
    "therefore , the unique properties of dwf provide a way to bring under control the systematic chiral symmetry breaking effects using today s supercomputers .",
    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , the techniques for performing a numerical simulation of the full @xmath0 su(2 ) sym theory using dwf are collected and it is demonstrated that they work as expected by performing numerical simulations of the full theory .",
    "second , the gluino condensate is measured .",
    "it is expected that a non - zero gluino condensate must form @xcite . however , there are also arguments that the theory has a phase where a gluino condensate does not form @xcite . in the numerical simulations performed here it",
    "is found that a non - zero gluino condensate is sustained in the limit of zero gluino mass .",
    "this result is at a finite lattice spacing and therefore susy is still broken albeit by irrelevant operators .",
    "it must be emphasized that in this work due to limited computer resources no attempt has been made to extrapolate to the continuum limit .",
    "it is possible that in this limit the gluino condensate may vanish .",
    "future work using larger computer resources could calculate the gluino condensate at several lattice spacings and extract the continuum value .",
    "but even then , it will never be possible to numerically prove that the finite lattice spacing theory is not separated from the continuum theory by a phase transition .",
    "this problem is not particular to the case at hand but is in the nature of numerical investigations .",
    "they can provide strong evidence but not unquestionable proof .",

    "theory the hamiltonian corresponding to the five dimensional transfer matrix has eigenvalues that are doubly degenerate because the fermion fields are in the adjoint representation @xcite .",
    "therefore when there is a `` topology '' change two eigenvalues will have to cross through zero ( as compared to one for fundamental fermions ) .",
    "this may make this theory harder to study than qcd in the sense that larger @xmath3 values may be required . on the other hand , since no massless goldstone particles",
    "are expected , the sensitivity of the spectrum on @xmath3 may be considerably milder .",
    "in any case , in this paper the only fermionic observable that will be discussed is the gluino condensate .",
    "this quantity is known to approach its @xmath4 limit with faster decay rates than the ones in @xmath68 ( for a discussion and results for full qcd see @xcite ; there the decay rate for the chiral condensate was about five times faster than that for @xmath68 ) .",
    "as was discussed above , the range of @xmath32 is renormalized by the interactions .",
    "it has been found that as the lattice spacing increases and one moves away from the continuum limit this range shrinks in size and for currently accessible spacings in qcd that range is about @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "as one moves even farther away from the continuum limit this range can shrink to zero and then it will not be possible to have light dwf modes @xcite .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that for as long as the range of allowed values of @xmath32 is not of zero size the overlap formalism , although it does not specify how it is approached , guarantees the existence of the @xmath4 limit . in this work , @xmath70 and , as it will be shown in section 5 , the behavior of the gluino condensate vs. @xmath3 is consistent with an exponential ansatz .",
    "fermions in the adjoint representation of the su(n ) gauge group have a dirac operator with index : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the winding of the background field configuration .",
    "classical instantons have integer winding and they cause condensation of operators with @xmath73 majorana fermions .",
    "this results in the breaking of the @xmath54 chiral symmetry down to the @xmath74 symmetry by the corresponding anomaly . the remaining @xmath74 symmetry may break spontaneously down to @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "mechanisms for this further breaking have been explored for example in @xcite where instantons and fractionally charged objects such as torons @xcite or caloron monopole constituents @xcite were investigated as the source of this symmetry breaking .    since in a toroidal geometry",
    "fractional winding numbers are possible @xcite , the partition function of the full theory can be expressed as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the vacuum angle and @xmath78 is the partition function on the sector with winding @xmath72 .",
    "for the theory with a soft breaking by a mass @xmath34 the interplay of the volume and mass in the formation of the gluino condensate has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to that reference for a very nice presentation on the subject . assuming a mass gap is present in the theory the authors of @xcite show that non - zero contributions to the gluino condensate @xmath79 come almost exclusively from the @xmath80 sector if @xmath81 . on the other hand , if @xmath82 all sectors contribute to a non - zero condensate .",
    "the above considerations result in an unusual picture . if the infinite volume limit is taken ( followed by the massless limit )",
    "it is possible that a gluino condensate will form due to spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetry @xmath74 down to @xmath75 . on the other hand , at a finite volume and zero mass a gluino condensate can form due to the presence of fractional winding configurations .",
    "since the volume is finite , this can not be the result of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "instead , it is similar to symmetry breaking due to topological effects as , for example , in one flavor qcd .",
    "as pointed above the size of @xmath83 controls which `` scenario '' takes place .    on the lattice",
    "there is no clear definition of topology .",
    "the path integral over the su(n ) group space generates configurations of all possible windings . in order for the lattice theory to be able to reproduce phenomena that relate to topology it is essential that the lattice dirac operator obeys the index theorem in a statistical sense",
    "this is highly non ",
    "trivial since it is obviously related to the doubling problem .",
    "traditional fermions ( wilson or staggered ) do not exhibit exact zero modes at finite lattice spacing .",
    "on the other hand , as mentioned in section [ sec_dwf_params ] , dwf at @xmath61 have exact zero modes and at finite @xmath3 have robust zero modes to a good approximation @xcite .",
    "an approximate form of the index theorem has been found to be obeyed for fundamental fermions in the overlap formulation in quenched su(2 ) @xcite and in quenched su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "the index of adjoint fermions in the overlap formulation in quenched su(2 ) has been studied in @xcite . in that work",
    "it was pointed out that the overlap dirac operator for adjoint fermions in the su(2 ) gauge group is necessarily even  valued .",
    "then the question posed by the authors of @xcite was whether or not all even values are realized or only values that are multiples of four are present .",
    "the latter case corresponds to configurations with instantons .",
    "the former case corresponds to fractional winding numbers .",
    "configurations with fractional winding were found and their presence persisted as the lattice spacing was decreased    in this paper dwf are used at finite @xmath3 and therefore some of the clarity present in the @xmath63 case will be lost .",
    "however , the full theory ( including the fermion determinant ) is studied here . furthermore , it is interesting to see if at a small volume and zero mass the gluino condensate still forms and if it does to what extent its value is due to zero mode effects .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section [ sec_numerical_results ] .      as discussed in the introduction and in section [ sec_analy ] , the dwf formulation of the @xmath0 su(2 ) sym theory at the @xmath4 limit",
    "is expected to preserve the @xmath54 chiral symmetry ( at the classical level ) and break supersymmetry only by irrelevant operators .",
    "since the dwf formulation contains many more fields than the continuum theory , one may naturally wonder what are the susy transformations in terms of these fields .",
    "in particular , while the continuum theory has a single majorana fermion the dwf lattice theory contains @xmath3 majorana fermions and @xmath3 corresponding pv fields . since all these fields , except for one majorana fermion , have masses near the cutoff , one can expect that the susy transformations should only transform the gauge field and the light majorana fermion represented by the boundary field @xmath84 of eq .",

    "if @xmath3 is finite then dwf are similar to wilson fermions and an analysis as in @xcite should indicate that this term is responsible for the same mass redefinition as the one in the chiral ward identity .",
    "as can be seen from section [ sec_lattice_formulation ] the @xmath0 su(2 ) sym theory can be simulated as a theory with 0.5 flavors of dirac fermions in the adjoint representation .",
    "an efficient and popular algorithm that can be used to simulate any number of flavors is the hybrid molecular dynamics r ( hmdr ) algorithm of @xcite . because of the grassmann nature of fermions these algorithms need to invert the matrix @xmath22 of eq .",

    "for an approach that uses wilson fermions and the multibosonic algorithm @xcite instead of the hmdr algorithm see @xcite . however , as mentioned earlier in the case of wilson fermions the last equality in eq .",

    "for the two flavor theory , one has a local action and therefore , at the end of the evolution , one can employ a metropolis accept - reject step .",

    "the only fermion observable measured in this work is the gluino condensate . by inserting appropriate source terms as in @xcite",
    "the gluino condensate was measured as the trace of @xmath146 with spin and fifth - direction indices restricted as dictated by eq .",

    "the @xmath162 volume simulations were done with @xmath163 .",

    "the quenched and dynamical values are very similar indicating that at @xmath163 the dynamical theory is in a phase that `` confines '' fundamental sources .",

    "the @xmath162 data from figure 7 are presented again in this figure to aid comparison .",
    "the value has decreased indicating that scaling is violated . however , without more simulations at other lattice spacings and volumes one can not conclude much from this result .",
    "the @xmath170 coupling is in the strong coupling region and furthermore the @xmath169 lattice volume is rather small .",
    "however , it is interesting to notice that the parameter @xmath183 ( a factor of 12 coming from the normalization of @xmath79 has been included ) .",
    "since @xmath176 the effective mass @xmath55 gets its value from finite @xmath3 effects . as @xmath3 is increased @xmath55 becomes small . from analysis of @xmath55 in strong coupling qcd",
    "@xcite one would roughly guess that @xmath184",
    ". then @xmath185 < 1 $ ] . in that case",
    ", the analysis of @xcite can be followed and one would expect the value of the condensate in the @xmath169 lattice to be mostly supported by configurations with total winding of @xmath186 . indeed , this can be seen from figure 9 . in that figure",
    "the evolutions in `` computer time '' are shown .",
    "the `` spikes '' in the evolution are apparent and they become more pronounced and less frequent as @xmath3 is increased ( and in effect @xmath55 is decreased ) .",
    "this is exactly how the effect of zero modes for small @xmath185 $ ] would present itself in a numerical simulation of the dynamical theory .",
    "as the fermion mass is made smaller , @xmath79 is expected to receive most of its value from sectors with winding @xmath186 .",
    "however , in these sectors the fermion determinant is very small because of the zero mode .",
    "since the probability for the algorithm to generate a gauge field configuration is proportional to the fermion determinant one would expect that these sectors will be visited less and less frequently as the effective mass is decreased .",
    "when these sectors are visited the value of @xmath155 will be very large ( spikes ) in order to compensate for the infrequent sampling . in this way the presence of the zero mode in the observable `` balances '' the presence of the zero mode in the determinant .",
    "as the mass is made smaller one would have to increase the size of the statistical sample in order to include enough of these increasingly `` rare '' but very large fluctuations .",
    "for similar results in the schwinger model and qcd see @xcite .",
    "a histogram of the values of @xmath155 is presented in figure 10 ( solid line ) . for small @xmath3",
    "the effective mass is larger and @xmath155 is distributed with a symmetric looking distribution around the mean value .",
    "however , for @xmath187 the effective mass is smaller and the distribution has a more pronounced `` tail '' towards larger values . in order to investigate this further numerical simulations at exactly the same parameters , but without the fermion determinant ( quenched theory ) were done .",
    "the histograms from these simulations are shown in the same figure for comparison ( dotted lines ) .",
    "one can observe that the absence of the fermion determinant had the effect of shifting the distributions to higher values .",
    "this is expected since configurations with small eigenvalues that produce larger values of @xmath155 are not suppressed anymore and are produced more frequently .",
    "also , one can observe that the number of configurations with @xmath155 larger than @xmath188 that appeared as spikes in figure 9 have now increased in number .",
    "these observations lend support to the presence of small near - zero eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , configurations with fractional topological charge have already been found in quenched su(2 ) simulations at similar couplings @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to calculate the index for the configurations of figure 9 using the methods of @xcite and see to what extent there is a correlation between fractional topological charge and the observed spikes .",
    "this correlation should be exact at @xmath4 but it will be obscured at finite @xmath3 by the presence of non - zero @xmath55 .",
    "this investigation is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "furthermore , it should also be noted that on the @xmath162 lattice there are no visible spikes up to @xmath161 . this can be seen in figure 11 . presumably this is because the product @xmath185 $ ] is probably much larger than in the @xmath169 lattice .",
    "again , this statement is not exact since the value of @xmath55 was not measured .",
    "these results are consistent with the discussion in section [ sec_topology ] . however , since even with @xmath176 , an @xmath3 extrapolation is essentially an extrapolation from non zero masses these results are not necessarily the results of a simulation at exactly @xmath63 .",
    "it is still possible that if such a simulation were done one could have found that the gluino condensate is zero .",
    "this could happen since in a finite volume and zero mass the effects of spontaneous symmetry breaking are absent and the zero mode effects alluded to above may not be sufficient to sustain a non zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "this type of simulation is possible and can be done using the overlap formalism @xcite or exact neuberger fermions @xcite . however , if one is to maintain exact chiral symmetry these methods will demand large computing resources .      perhaps the largest uncertainty in the analysis presented in the previous subsections has to do with the assumption of exponential decay as in eq .",
    "[ exponential ] . for small enough lattice spacings and large enough @xmath3 this behavior",
    "is expected to be true .",
    "all data presented in this work were well represented by this ansatz . however , as with any numerical investigation , one can never completely disprove all other possibilities .",
    "while such an exercise over all possible functions would clearly be fruitless there are some alternative forms that may be reasonable to consider since they are based on analytical considerations .    far from the continuum limit , the approach to the chiral limit may become power law @xcite or even completely disappear @xcite . in order to explore the possibility of power law behavior",
    "the @xmath176 data for the @xmath162 and @xmath169 volumes were fit to the form : @xmath189 the results of the fit are given in table [ tab_plaw_fits ] ( the fits are not presented in any of the figures ) .",
    "as can be seen from that table the @xmath190 of these fits is significantly larger than the one of the corresponding exponential fits to the same data .",
    "another possibility is decay to zero with two different exponential decay rates .",
    "such a behavior was found to be consistent with investigations of the two flavor schwinger model @xcite for a quantity that is expected to vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "there it was argued that the fast decay rare is due to fluctuations within a given topological sector while the slow decay rate is due to the presence of topology changing configurations .",
    "therefore , for @xmath176 one could try to fit the largest three @xmath3 points to the form : @xmath191 the results of the fit for the @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath176 , and @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 points as well as for the @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath176 , and @xmath161 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 points are shown in table [ tab_no_const_exponential ] .",
    "the fit to the @xmath162 data is acceptable .",
    "however , the fit to the @xmath169 data has a rather large @xmath190 .",
    "because this fit is for larger @xmath3 than the @xmath162 fit one would expect that if there were a second exponential decaying to zero its effect would be more pronounced in the @xmath169 fit .",
    "therefore , the large @xmath190 of the @xmath169 fit suggests that the presence of a second exponential decaying to zero is not likely .",
    "this could be made more precise if simulations with larger @xmath3 values for the @xmath162 and @xmath169 lattices were done .",
    "however , such simulations are beyond the computing resources of this project .",
    "also , the analysis in @xcite suggests functional forms with more parameters",
    ". it would be interesting to fit to these forms but that would require more data points and better statistics both of which are also beyond the computing resources of this project .    finally , the susy breaking by the irrelevant terms may have non - negligible effects at the lattice spacings studied here .",
    "although it was found that the chiral condensate is non  zero at the chiral limit in two lattice spacings , this is not enough to estimate its value in the continuum limit .",
    "the formulation of @xmath0 , su(2 ) super yang - mills theory on the lattice with domain wall fermions ( dwf ) has several advantages over more traditional lattice fermion regulators . even at non - zero lattice spacing the chiral limit",
    "can be taken by letting @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is the number of sites along the fifth auxiliary direction . since in that limit",
    "there is no gluino mass term , supersymmetry is broken only by irrelevant operators and there is no need for fine tuning .",
    "also , in that limit the theory has exact zero modes on non - trivial topological backgrounds .",
    "however , even at finite @xmath3 , where numerical simulations are done , these properties are maintained to a good degree allowing extrapolations to the @xmath4 limit .",
    "furthermore , the pfaffian resulting from the integration of majorana fermions is positive definite at finite @xmath3 , non - zero lattice spacing and for any background gauge field configuration . as a result",
    ", one can unambiguously interpret it as a probability measure to be used by the numerical simulation for importance sampling .",
    "this property also allows the use of standard numerical algorithms where any number of flavors @xmath197 can be simulated .",
    "by contrast , wilson fermions have this positivity property only at the continuum limit .    in this work , the full @xmath0 , su(2 ) super yang - mills theory was numerically simulated on the lattice using dwf .",
    "the gluino condensate @xmath79 was measured .",
    "these simulations did not present any unexpected technical difficulties .",
    "a finite value of @xmath3 breaks chiral symmetry and induces a small gluino mass .",
    "in addition , an explicit gluino mass @xmath34 was used to provide extra control .",
    "several @xmath34 and @xmath3 values were used ( all corresponding to positive gluino mass ) and the value of @xmath79 was extrapolated to the chiral limit using three different methods .",
    "all methods gave consistent results indicating small systematic effects and suggesting that the functions used for the fits are consistent .",
    "these simulations were done on a lattice with @xmath162 lattice sites .",
    "additional simulations on a lattice with @xmath169 lattice sites but approximately double the lattice spacing were done .",
    "again , extrapolations to the chiral limit gave a non - zero @xmath79 .",
    "in this lattice @xmath198 < 1 $ ] .",
    "then analytical considerations suggest that the value of @xmath79 must come mostly from topological sectors with fractional topological charge of @xmath186 .",
    "indeed , as the mass was made smaller unusually large values ( spikes ) were observed in the statistical sample of @xmath155 indicating the singular contribution of these sectors .",
    "the spectrum of the theory is of great interest but it was not possible to measure on the small lattices considered here .",
