    "phase ordering kinetics is a phenomenon often encountered in nature .",
    "systems with this kind of dynamics provide , possibly , the simplest realization of cooperative out of equilibrium dynamics at macroscopic scales . for such systems , the mechanisms whereby the relaxation takes place are usually well - understood  @xcite , but quantitative predictions on relevant observables are hard to derive analytically .",
    "coarsening systems are important from a fundamental point of view as they pose many technical questions that are also encountered in other macroscopic systems out of equilibrium that are not so well - understood , such as glasses or active matter .",
    "they are also important from the standpoint of applications as the macroscopic properties of many materials depend upon their domain morphology .",
    "the hallmark of coarsening systems is dynamic scaling , that is to say , the fact that the morphological pattern of domains at earlier times looks statistically similar to the pattern at later times apart from a global change of scale  @xcite .",
    "dynamic scaling has been successfully used to describe the dynamic structure factor measured with scattering methods , and the space - time correlations computed numerically in many models .",
    "it has also been shown in a few exactly solvable cases and within analytic approximations to coarse - grained models .",
    "new experimental techniques make now possible the direct visualization of the domain structure of three - dimensional coarsening systems . in earlier studies ,",
    "the domain structure was usually observed _ post mortem _ , and only on exposed two - dimensional slices of the samples , with optic or electronic microscopy .",
    "nowadays , it became possible to observe the full @xmath0 micro structure _ in situ _ and in the course of evolution .",
    "these methods open the way to observe microscopic processes that were so far out of experimental reach .",
    "for instance , in the context of soft - matter systems , laser scanning confocal microscopy was applied to phase separating binary liquids  @xcite and polymer blends  @xcite , while x - ray tomography was used to observe phase separating glass - forming liquid mixtures  @xcite and the time evolution of foams towards the scaling state  @xcite . in the realm of magnetic systems",
    "the method presented in  @xcite looks very promising .",
    "three dimensional images give , in principle , access to a complete topological characterization of the interfaces via the calculation of quantities such as the euler characteristics and the local mean and gaussian curvatures . on top of these very detailed analyses",
    ", one can also extract the evolution of the morphological domain structure on different planes across the samples and investigate up to which extent the third dimension has an effect on what occurs in strictly two dimensions . in this paper",
    "the focus is set on the dynamic universality class of non - conserved scalar order parameter , as realized by ising - like magnetic samples taken into the ferromagnetic phase across their second order phase transition .",
    "an important question is to which extent the results for the morphological properties of strictly @xmath1 coarsening apply to the @xmath1 slices of @xmath0 coarsening . in the theoretical study of phase ordering kinetics , a continuous coarse - grained description of the domain growth process , in the form of a time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation , is used . within this approach , at zero temperature , the local velocity of any interface is proportional to its local mean curvature .",
    "accordingly , in @xmath1 the domains can neither merge nor disconnect in two ( or more ) components . in @xmath1 one",
    "can further exploit the fact that the dynamics are curvature driven and use the gauss - bonnet theorem to find an approximate expressions for several statistical and geometric properties that characterize the domain structure . in this way ,",
    "expressions for the number density of domain areas , number density of perimeter lengths , the relation between the area and the length of a domain , etc . were found  @xcite . in @xmath0 , instead , the curvature driven dynamics do not prohibit breaking a domain in two or merging two domains , and the gauss - bonnet theorem , that involves the gaussian curvature instead of the mean curvature , can not be used to derive expressions for the statistical and geometric properties of volumes and areas .",
    "moreover , merging can occur in two - dimensional slices of a three - dimensional system , for example , _ via _ the escape of the opposite phase in - between into the perpendicular direction to the plane .",
    "two previous studies of @xmath0 domain growth are worth mentioning here , although their focus was different from ours as we explain below .",
    "the morphology of the @xmath0 zero - temperature non - conserved scalar order parameter coarsening was addressed in  @xcite . from the numerical solution of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation",
    ", results on the time - dependence of the topological properties of the interfaces were obtained .",
    "the late time dynamics of the @xmath0 ising model evolving at zero temperature was analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in these papers that the @xmath0im does not reach the ground state nor a frozen state at vanishing temperature .",
    "instead , it stays wandering around an iso - energy subspace of phase space made of metastable states that differ from one another by the state of blinking spins that flip at no energy cost  @xcite . at very low temperature",
    "the relaxation proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , with the formation of a metastable state similar to the ones of zero - temperature ; next , with the actual approach to equilibrium  @xcite . the sponge - like nature of the metastable states was examined in  @xcite .    in our study",
    "we use monte carlo simulations of the @xmath0 ising model ( i m ) on a cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions , and we focus on the statistical and geometrical properties of the geometric domains and hull - enclosed areas on planes of the cubic lattice . a number of equilibrium critical properties , necessary to better understand our study of the coarsening dynamics in sec .  [ sec.coarsening ] ,",
    "are first revisited in sec .",
    "[ sec.eq ] .",
    "we start the study of the dynamics by comparing the contraction of a spherical domain immersed in the background of the opposite phase in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , both at zero and finite temperature .",
    "this study , even though for a symmetric and isolated domain , allows us to evaluate the dynamic growing length and its temperature dependence .",
    "when the domains are not isolated , as is the case , for instance , of two circular slices lying on the same plane but being associated to the same @xmath0 torus , merging may occur along evolution , and this process contributes to the complexity of the problem .",
    "we also study the dynamic scaling of the space - time correlation on the @xmath1 slices .",
    "following these introductory parts , the statistical and morphological properties of the areas and perimeters of geometric domains and hull - enclosed areas on @xmath1 slices of the @xmath0im are then presented .",
    "we end by summarising our results and by discussing some lines for future research in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "still , the @xmath1 spin clusters on a slice , defined by taking all the spins in a @xmath0 lattice @xmath17 with either @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 fixed , _ are _ critical with properties of a new universality class  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the distribution of the length of the surrounding interfaces , @xmath21 , and the area as a function of this length , @xmath22 , satisfy @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "similar measurements were performed in ref .",

    "we consider the number density of cluster areas on a two dimensional plane .",
    "the area is defined as the number of spins in a geometric cluster that are connected ( as first neighbors on the square lattice ) to its border . with this definition one",
    "excludes the spins in the holes inside a cluster , that is to say , one considers the proper domain areas . at criticality ,",

    "we showed that although working with rather large system sizes the measured exponents are still far from their asymptotic values when working on the @xmath1 slices .",
    "next we moved to the analysis of the geometric clusters and hull - enclosed areas that develop after instantaneous quenches from equilibrium at the infinite and the critical temperature .",
    "we found striking differences between the case with long range correlations in the initial state ( @xmath78 ) and the case in which these do not exist ( @xmath181 ) . in the absence of correlations , neighboring layers are independent , and even though strong correlations are built after a sudden subcritical quench , the subsequent behavior does not essentially differ ( within our numerical precision ) from the one found in the strictly @xmath1 case . on the other hand , for critical initial states ,",
    "distant slices are correlated initially and such effect introduces differences between properties of the slices and the actual @xmath1 system .",
    "these differences already exist in the initial state , as explained in the previous paragraph .",
    "the extra weight on the finite size areas ( a factor 2 ) seems to be washed out very rapidly after the quench and the small rescaled areas on the @xmath1 slices soon become very similar ( identical within our numerical accuracy ) to the ones of the @xmath1 system .",
