    "of particular relevance to the present experiments is the fact that a sudden _ increase _ in the unit cell volume by @xmath27 1% accompanies this `` change of the defect '' o4 @xmath80o3 at @xmath6 80 k @xcite .",
    "since o3 should be the sole defect in our strongly overdoped samples , this implies that if sufficiently high pressure is applied , the o4 defect should become energetically favored over o3 .  in this picture",
    "the nonlinearity in @xmath37 would signal a sudden changeover from a dominant o3 defect to o4 .",
    "the fact that the critical onset pressure for sample b is somewhat larger ( 0.5 gpa ) than for sample a ( 0.4 gpa ) supports this picture since sample b is more strongly overdoped and thus the o3 defect more stable .",
    "neutron diffraction experiments under high pressure conditions would be desirable to clarify the anomalous but interesting overdoped state in hg-1201 .",

    "this result would appear to support a simple charge - transfer model @xcite in which @xmath83 and @xmath84 constant 0 .  however",
    ", this would lead to the expectation that @xmath85 0 for an optimally doped sample ( where @xmath86 0 ) , contrary to the experimental result that @xmath87 + 1.75 @xmath11 0.1 k / gpa @xcite .",
    "we note that the intrinsic pressure dependence for the more strongly overdoped sample b is only half the magnitude of that for sample a ; the charge transfer model would lead to the expectation that @xmath88 should be _",
    "greater _ in magnitude , contrary to experiment .",
    "it is certainly possible that pressure - dependent shifts in the defect structure in hg-1201 play a role here",
    ".  further measurements of @xmath37 together with systematic structural studies under high pressure are needed to resolve this issue .      in order to better characterize the relaxation behavior at different pressures and temperatures in overdoped hg-1201",
    ", we calculate the pressure - dependent activation energy @xmath89 from the measured values of the relaxation time @xmath90 at a given temperature using the arrhenius law      we set the attempt period @xmath92 equal to the value ( @xmath93 1.4@xmath2810@xmath94 s ) found in earlier temperature - quench experiments on y-123 @xcite .  using the values of the relaxation times at ambient pressure from the previous section ,",
    "the corresponding activation energy for overdoped ( sample a ) and underdoped hg-1201 can be calculated using eq .",
    "3 , yielding @xmath951 bar ) @xmath8 0.84 ev and 0.90 ev , respectively .",
    "these values are quite comparable to each other and to activation energies determined from relaxation studies on y-123 ( 0.97 ev ) @xcite , tl-2201 ( 0.72 ev ) @xcite and tl-1212 ( 0.86 ev ) @xcite , as well as to oxygen tracer diffusion studies on y-123 and other oxide superconductors @xcite",
    "this fact , and the known sensitivity of the relaxation behavior to the oxygen content @xcite , make it likely that the above relaxation effects originate in the oxygen sublattice .  to our knowledge",
    ", no attempt has yet been made to compute the energy barrier for oxygen diffusion in hg-1201 ; in a recent model calculation islam and winch @xcite have estimated @xmath951 bar ) @xmath33 0.68 ev for the migration of interstitial o(4 ) oxygen in the three - layer compound hg-1223 , a value roughly comparable to our present result for hg-1201 .",
    "it is interesting to note that no relaxation whatsoever has been observed in @xmath4 for optimally doped hg-1201 @xcite or , for that matter , for any other optimally doped oxide superconductor studied to date @xcite .",
    "does this mean that in optimally doped samples relaxation phenomena do not occur ?  certainly not !",
    "the absence of relaxation phenomena in @xmath4 for optimally doped samples can be readily understood if the change in @xmath4 due to relaxation phenomena originates primarily from a change in the carrier concentration @xmath96 in the cuo@xmath0 plane(s ) ; hall effect studies on tl-2201 support this conclusion @xcite .  in an optimally doped sample the value of @xmath4 is maximized as a function of @xmath97 i.e. @xmath98 is at an extremum where @xmath99 0 , so that @xmath100 0 .  in optimally doped samples ,",
    "therefore , relaxation processes in the oxygen sublattice initially cause no change in @xmath63 but should have a measurable effect on other properties such as the electrical resistivity , hall coefficient , lattice parameters , etc .  in this regard",
    "further studies on the hg - oxides would be of particular interest since optimal doping occurs at a _ finite _ concentration of oxygen defects , in contrast to y-123 and tl-1201 which are nearly devoid of oxygen defects when @xmath4 is at its maximum value .",
    "an important question remaining is to identify the mechanism by which the relaxation processes change the carrier concentration in hg-1201 .",
    "for y-123 veal and paulikas @xcite proposed that the local rearrangement of oxygen anions in the cuo chain layer causes the valence of the ambivalent cu@xmath101 cations in this layer to change .",
    "the maintainance of overall charge neutrality then dictates that the charge carrier concentration in the cuo@xmath0 layers must adjust accordingly .  in tl-2201",
    "the oxygen defects are incorporated interstitially in the tl@xmath0o@xmath18 double - layer @xcite ; some form of local ordering of these oxygen would then prompt some of the ambivalent tl@xmath102-cations in this layer to decrease their valence by drawing electron charge away from the cuo@xmath18 plane ( for thallium + 1 and + 3 are the preferred valence states ) .",
    "the presence of ambivalent cations would not appear to be mandatory for charge transfer to occur , but probably serves to enhance it ; as pointed out in the introduction , relaxation phenomena have been reported in superoxygenated la@xmath18cuo@xmath24 @xcite , although this compound contains no ambivalent cations outside the cuo@xmath0 layer .",
    "hg-1201 would appear to be a further such example , since xps studies @xcite on an optimally doped sample indicate that the valence of hg is 2 + .",
    "further evidence against hg cation ambivalence in hg - oxides is given by chemical analysis on a series of hg-1212 samples near optimal doping which show that the average cu valence increases with oxygen content , but that the valence of hg is fixed at 2 + @xcite .",
    "two possible mechanisms for the observed weak relaxation phenomena in hg-1201 are :  ( 1 ) the degree of oxygen ordering may directly influence how the available hole carriers are distributed between the cuo@xmath18 planes and other structural elements @xcite ; ( 2 ) ambivalent cu@xmath103 cations on hg sites may switch their valence as oxygen defects rearrange .",
    "indeed , studies by wagner et al .",
    "@xcite show that there is a substitutional defect in hg-1201 in the form of a partial substitution of cu ions on the hg site ; the same overdoped hg-1201 sample a used in the present experiments was found to contain a substitution of @xmath104 8% of cu on the hg site @xcite which could conceivably lead to modest relaxation effects of the order @xmath27 8% of that expected for full substitution .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the present experiment on overdoped hg-1201 ( sample a ) the magnitude of the observed relaxation derivative ( @xmath105 -0.3 k / gpa ) is only @xmath106 10% of that for y-123 @xcite with a similar value of @xmath17 .",
    "a critical test would be to study non optimally doped hg-1201 samples devoid of cu substitution ; if the second scenario is correct , there would then be no relaxation in @xmath4 .      using the values of @xmath90 for overdoped hg-1201 ( sample a ) from the previous section",
    ", @xmath89 is calculated using eq .",
    "3 and displayed in fig .",
    "we ignore any change in @xmath92 with pressure since its anticipated decrease under pressure is very small @xcite .  in this figure",
    "the value of the pressure near the annealing temperature @xmath107 rather than the value near @xmath63 is used since below 250 k only insignificant relaxation occurs .",
    "assuming that , as found previously for y-123 @xcite , @xmath7 is a linear function of pressure , we obtain @xmath108 ( + 114 @xmath11 50 ) mev / gpa ( dashed line in fig . 6 ) . to our knowledge ,",

    "@xcite where we found @xmath109 ( + 44 @xmath11 2 ) mev / gpa , approximately half the present value for hg-1201 .    the pressure dependence of relaxation behavior is normally analyzed in terms of an activation volume @xmath110 which can be calculated from the pressure dependence of the activation energy @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the change in volume due to the formation of a vacancy or interstitial",
    ", @xmath113 is the volume change due to the migration of the diffusing atom , and @xmath114 is avogadro s number . if we assume that the oxygen defects involved in the relaxation phenomena are already present and need not be created , then @xmath112 = 0 .",
    "as discussed above , two distinct types of oxygen defect have been found in the hgo layer in hg-1201 @xcite , with a transition from one type to the other near the optimal doping concentration .",
    "the nonlinearity in @xmath20 seen in fig .",
    "2 near 0.4 gpa for the overdoped samples may signal a transition from the o3 to o4 defect type .  since in the present experiments the time dependence of the relaxation behavior",
    "was only studied for pressures below 0.3 gpa , we assume that only a single oxygen defect type is responsible for the relaxation , so that @xmath115 .  from eq .",

    "+ 4.2 cm@xmath29/mol @xcite was obtained .",
    "a positive migration volume @xmath113 implies that the lattice increases in volume as a diffusing ion passes over a saddle point in moving from one site to another .",
    "it is physically reasonable that diffusion slows under pressure ( @xmath120 0 ) because squeezing the lattice together leaves less space through which the interstitial atoms can diffuse . indeed , in ionic compounds @xcite , such as the oxide superconductors , a positive activation volume is normally observed .",
    "however , an enhancement of the diffusion rate under pressure ( negative activation volume ) may be observed in covalently bonded substances , such as amorphous si @xcite .",
    "recently , the activation volume for both hg-1201 and y-123 has been calculated @xcite using a hard sphere model to estimate the local expansion in the lattice as the oxygen defect travels along its diffusion path .  for both systems the measured values of @xmath110",
    "are underestimated by a factor of two to three in this model .    in summary , the present experiments on hg-1201 give evidence for weak relaxation phenomena in the transition temperature for both under- and overdoped samples ; these relaxation effects are opposite in sign but roughly equal in magnitude and involve similar activation energies .",
    "this result , plus the absence of relaxation effects in @xmath4 for optimally doped hg-1201 @xcite , support the view that relaxation phenomena influence @xmath4 via the transfer of charge in or out of the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
