    "quantum computation considerations have generated a great deal of recent interest in the old @xcite problem of electron spin coherence in semiconductors .",
    "in particular , a localized electron spin can act as a qubit ( i.e. , a quantum dynamical two - level system ) for quantum information processing in scalable solid - state quantum computer architectures . @xcite but using such spin qubits for quantum information processing purposes necessarily requires long spin coherence time , and therefore understanding electron spin decoherence in the solid - state environment becomes a key issue . in this paper ,",
    "we develop a quantum theory for , what we consider to be , the most important electron spin decoherence mechanism in spin - qubit based semiconductor quantum computer architectures .",
    "the spin decoherence mechanism we consider here is the so - called spectral diffusion mechanism , which has a long history , @xcite and has been much - studied recently@xcite in the context of spin qubit decoherence .    to provide a physical background for the theory to be presented in this paper we start by considering a localized electron in a solid , for example , a donor - bound electron in a semiconductor as in the doped si : p system .",
    "such a si : p system is the basis of the kane quantum computer architecture.@xcite the electron spin could decohere through a number of mechanisms . in particular , spin relaxation would occur via phonon or impurity scattering in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , but these relaxation processes are strongly suppressed in localized systems and can be arbitrarily reduced by lowering the temperature . in the dilute doping regime of interest in quantum computation , where the localized electron spins are well - separated spatially ,",
    "direct magnetic dipolar interaction between the electrons themselves is not an important dephasing mechanism.@xcite interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spin bath is therefore the important decoherence mechanism at low temperatures and for localized electron spins .",
    "now we restrict ourselves to a situation in the presence of an external magnetic field ( which is the situation of interest to us in this paper ) and consider the spin decoherence channels for the localized electron spin interacting with the lattice nuclear spin bath . since the gyromagnetic ratios ( and hence the zeeman energies ) for the electron spin and the nuclear spins are typically a factor of 2000 different ( the electron zeeman energy being larger ) , hyperfine coupling induced direct spin - flip transitions between electron and nuclear spins would be impossible at low temperature since phonons would be required for energy conservation .",
    "@xcite this leaves the indirect spectral diffusion mechanism@xcite as the most effective electron spin decoherence mechanism at low temperatures and finite magnetic fields .",
    "the spectral diffusion process is associated with the dephasing of the electron spin resonance due to the temporally fluctuating nuclear magnetic field at the localized electron site .",
    "these temporal fluctuations cause the electron spin resonance frequency to diffuse in the frequency space , hence the name spectral diffusion .",
    "the specific electron spin spectral diffusion process being considered in this work is that arising from the magnetic dipolar interaction induced flip - flop mechanism in nuclear spins .",
    "other local flip - flop mechanisms between nuclei , such as indirect exchange interactions @xcite ( which we will briefly address in this paper in the context of gaas ) , may be easily included in our formalism .",
    "spectral diffusion ( sd ) is , in principle , not a limiting decoherence process for silicon or germanium based quantum computer architectures because these can , in principle , be fabricated free of nuclear spins using isotopic purification .",
    "unfortunately this is not true for the important class of materials based on iii - v compounds , where sd has been shown to play a major role.@xcite there is as yet no direct ( e.g. , gaas quantum dots ) experimental measurement of localized spin dephasing in iii - v materials , but such experimental results are anticipated in the near future .",
    "indirect spin echo measurements based on singlet - triplet transitions in coupled gaas quantum dot systems@xcite give @xmath0 times consistent with our theoretical results .",
    "sd is a theoretically challenging problem because the temporally fluctuating random field causing the electron spin dephasing is a non - markovian stochastic dynamical variable arising from the complex dipolar quantum dynamics of a large number of interacting nuclear spins .",
    "although sd is an intrinsic dephasing mechanism contributing to the so - called @xmath0-type ( i.e. `` transverse '' ) spin decoherence in the phenomenological bloch equation language , the effect of sd on the electron spin dynamics ( for example , on the electron spin resonance measurement ) can not be characterized by a simple relaxation ( or dephasing ) time @xmath0 associated with a `` trivial '' @xmath1 type of temporal loss of coherence .",
    "the non - markovian nuclear spin bath dynamics produces a rather complex electron spin dephasing which can not be characterized by a single decoherence time ( except as a very crude approximation ) .",
    "it is therefore more appropriate to consider sd in the context of a specific experimental situation , and it has been traditional , going back to the seminal pioneering work of hahn , to study sd in the context of the spin echo decay in pulsed spin resonance measurements.@xcite in spin echo measurements , the inhomogeneous broadening effects are suppressed by design , and any amplitude decay in the consecutive pulses arises entirely from the @xmath0-dephasing time associated with sd ( and , of course , other applicable @xmath0-type transverse relaxation processes ) .",
    "it was realized a long time ago@xcite that sd due to the dipolar fluctuations of nuclear spins often dominates the coherence decay in electron spin echo experiments .",
    "all available theories to date are based on classical stochastic modeling of the nuclear field , a markovian theoretical framework which is inevitably phenomenological since it requires an arbitrary choice for the spectrum of nuclear fluctuations .",
    "such a classical markovian modeling is arguably incompatible with the strict requirements of spin coherence and control in a quantum information device .",
    "in addition , recent rapid experimental progress in single spin measurements , @xcite which in the near future promises sensitive measurements of quantum effects in spin resonance , also warrants a quantum theory of sd . in the current work ,",
    "we develop a quantum theory of spin echo decay in electron spin resonance experiments due to the sd caused by the dipolar interaction induced flip - flop nuclear spin dynamics .",
    "we emphasize that , in contrast to all the earlier theories of sd in the literature , our theory is fully quantum mechanical and incorporates the dipolar nuclear spin flip - flop dynamics microscopically without making any phenomenological statistical ( markovian or otherwise ) approximations . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "ours is the first fully quantum theory for electron spin sd in solid state systems .",
    "a proper description of coupled spin dynamics is rather difficult due to the absence of the usual wick s theorem for spin degrees of freedom . in that regard ,",
    "variations of our method may prove rather useful , since environmental spin baths are ubiquitous in any device exploiting the coherent properties of quantum spin systems .",
    "our theory produces an accurate quantitative and qualitative prediction of the hahn echo decay .",
    "it was pointed out a long time ago @xcite that the observed time dependence of these echoes are well fitted to the expression @xmath2 , a behavior which can be derived phenomenologically@xcite by assuming lorentzian brownian motion for the electron spin zeeman frequency . in our method",
    "this approximate behavior arises naturally from the collective quantum evolution of the dipolar coupled nuclei , without any phenomenological assumption on the dynamics of the environment responsible for decoherence .",
    "our theory reveals that the inclusion of quantum corrections to nuclear spin fluctuation increases the degree of decoherence at lower to intermediate time scales , as is best evidenced from our explanation of the existing factor of @xmath3 discrepancy between the markovian stochastic theory @xcite and experimental data @xcite of spin echo decay in phosphorus doped silicon .",

    "[ sd_schematic ] , width=326 ]    in systems of interest to us , a qubit is represented by the spin of a localized electron , at low temperature and in a strong external magnetic field , with a wave function that typically envelopes hundreds of thousands of nuclei or more in the surrounding neighborhood of the lattice .",
    "two such examples are the shallow donor electron state in a phosphorus dopant in silicon@xcite and a localized electron in a quantum dot in gaas.@xcite a schematic @xcite of the spectral diffusion process in the former is shown in fig .",
    "[ sd_schematic ] .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the dominant decoherence method is spectral diffusion ( sd ) caused by the dynamic evolution of nuclear spins resulting in effective magnetic field fluctuations experienced by the electron .",
    "the electron spin couples to nuclear spins via hyperfine interaction in the region in which the electron wave function is appreciable .",
    "the nuclear spins couple to each other via dipolar interactions .",
    "the large external field suppresses processes that do not conserve electron or nuclear spin polarization in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "thus the only relevant nuclear processes are flip - flops in which one spin is raised while the other is lowered .",
    "sd is a dephasing decoherence ( i.e. , a transverse or @xmath0-type relaxation ) process , affecting only the precession of the electron spin in the bloch sphere without changing the electron spin component along the magnetic field .",
    "it thus contributes to the energy - conserving @xmath0 decoherence rather than @xmath7 decoherence in which energy is exchanged with the bath ( ref .",
    "details our definition of @xmath7 , @xmath0 , and @xmath8 ) .",
    "the @xmath7 time for these systems at low temperature is known to be much longer than this @xmath0 time . to analyze this decoherence",
    ", we consider an ensemble of spins , initialized in some direction perpendicular to the magnetic field , and observe the decay of the average spin over time . in experiments ,",
    "many sparse donors or dots serve as the ensemble , and they are initialized by applying a @xmath9-pulse to rotate electron spins polarized along the magnetic field axis into the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field . for the free induction decay ( fid ) , no further pulses are applied and the observed decay is largely due to inhomogeneous broadening which is caused by the difference in the local magnetic field of each electron , causing precession at different rates for different electrons .",
    "this will provide what is referred to as the @xmath8 decoherence time . at the very least ,",
    "this inhomogeneous broadening is a result of the random initial distribution of nuclear spin states which gives an uncertainty that scales as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the effective number of nuclei ( @xmath12 ) influencing the electron significantly .",
    "this decoherence due to inhomogeneous broadening can be eliminated by refocusing methods such as the hahn echo.@xcite in such an experiment , a @xmath13-pulse , resonant with electron spins , is applied at time @xmath14 in the same direction as the original @xmath9 pulse and then an echo is observed at @xmath15 .",
    "this has the effect of reversing any static local field effects and allows us to obtain the actual sd decoherence ( i.e. , the @xmath0 decoherence as opposed to @xmath8 decoherence ) caused by effective magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "this experiment provides a measure of @xmath0 .",
    "the current paper will analyze the hahn echo experiment .",
    "more sophisticated pulses , such as the carr - purcell - meiboom - gill sequence,@xcite can yield even longer decoherence times and will be analyzed in future publications .    previous attempts at analyzing this sd decoherence have been based on quasiclassical stochastic modeling .",
    "herzog and hahn @xcite assigned a phenomenological gaussian probability distribution function for the zeeman frequency of the investigated spin without considering the dynamics of the nuclear bath .",
    "later , klauder and anderson @xcite used a lorentzian distribution function instead in order to account for a power law time dependence observed in experiments by mims and nassau.@xcite zhidomirov and salikhov @xcite devised a more sophisticated theory , with a wider range of applicability , in which the flip rate of each spin in the bath was characterized by poisson distributions .",
    "very recently de sousa and das sarma,@xcite in considering spectral diffusion by nuclear spin flip - flops , extended this theory to characterize flip - flop rates of pairs rather than individual spins within a phenomenological model .",
    "in this paper , we present a microscopic theory that is based entirely on the quantum mechanics of the system without resorting to phenomenological distribution functions .",
    "no markovian assumption nor any assumption about the form of the solution was used to obtain our results here .",
    "our expansion is entirely based upon a density matrix formulation of the problem which assumes infinite nuclear spin temperature ( @xmath16  nk ) and uses an approximate but microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "the problem obviously involves too many nuclear spins to solve directly using exact hamiltonian diagonalization ; however , the cluster expansion method we devise can give successive approximations to the exact solution ( convergent for short times , but often out to the tail of the decay such that the full solution is obtained for practical purposes ) .",
    "a short report of our results without any theoretical details has earlier appeared as a rapid communication [ ] .",
    "our lowest order solution @xcite was recently reproduced by yao _",
    "et al._@xcite using an entirely different approach , thus providing an independent validation of our theoretical approach .",
    "the free evolution hamiltonian for the spectral diffusion problem , considering one localized electron spin , @xmath17 , and a nuclear spin bath , @xmath18 , in an external magnetic field @xmath19 ( taken to be along the @xmath20 direction ) , is given by @xmath21 where the first two terms are due to the zeeman energies of the electron and nuclei respectively , @xmath22 gives the electron - nuclei coupling , and @xmath23 contains the internuclear coupling .",

    "it is dominated by the hyperfine coupling for nuclei that contribute significantly to sd . since @xmath29 is typically",
    "four orders of magnitude larger than @xmath26 , flip - flop processes between the electron and a nuclear spin are strongly suppressed at low temperatures ( i.e. , no phonons ) by energy conservation in a strong magnetic field.@xcite this direct hyperfine interaction leads to quantitatively important effects at zero magnetic field,@xcite but at the moderate or high magnetic fields required for spin resonance measurements it only contributes a small visibility decay.@xcite we will therefore disregard the nonsecular part of the electron - nuclei coupling , leaving us with @xmath30 which we will use as the definition for @xmath22 throughout the rest of this paper .",

    "the cluster expansion will include processes that involve a successively increasing number of nuclei . because an isolated nucleus in our model does not contribute to spectral diffusion , at the lowest nontrivial order we include any simultaneous processes involving two nuclei ( pairs ) .",

    "because _ all _ processes involving a given number of nuclei are included at each order of this expansion , and because these processes are independent ( proven formally in sec .",
    "[ formalclusterexpansion ] and the related appendix ) , rather than working with individual processes , we can work with contributions due to each given `` cluster '' of nuclei ( for now , simply defined as a set of nuclei ) ; such a `` cluster contribution '' includes contributions from all of the processes involving all nuclei in that cluster in an interdependent way ( i.e. , not separable into independent sub - processes ) .",
    "thus we may say that the @xmath77 order of the expansion includes contributions from clusters up to size @xmath78 .",

    "the significance of our quantum theory lies in the fact that , unlike all other theoretical descriptions of spectral diffusion spanning the last @xmath393 years , we do not make any _ ad hoc _ phenomenological stochastic approximation in dealing with the non - markovian spin dynamics in the spectral diffusion phenomena .",
    "we solve the problem essentially exactly using a quantum cluster decomposition technique , which is then theoretically justified by carrying out calculations to higher orders and by comparing with two independent perturbation techniques ( i.e. , the tau expansion and the dipolar perturbation theory ) .",
    "very recently , a completely independent verification of our theory and results has appeared in the literature.@xcite    our theory for spin decoherence is restricted to understanding the so - called @xmath0-decoherence of a single localized spin in a solid due to the dipolar nuclear spin flip - flops in the surrounding nuclear spin bath and in the specific context of a spin echo experiment .",
    "we neglect spin decoherence effects arising from the direct hyperfine coupling between the central spin and the surrounding nuclear spins , which would contribute to the free induction decay signal , but can be corrected by the spin echo technique .",
    "our method uses a cluster expansion technique supported by two underlying perturbation theories : the dipolar perturbation expansion and the tau - expansion .",
    "each of these perturbation theories generates a unique expansion scheme in its own right , but only the cluster expansion converges for large systems [ only for short times , @xmath180 , but often extending to the tail of the decoherence decay ] .",
    "the convergence of this expansion has to be explicitly checked in each application , as we have done in this work .",
    "it is possible that an alternative more conventional perturbation theory for the non - markovian spectral diffusion problem can be developed within the standard interaction picture of the many - body quantum theory which would be completely equivalent ( for short times ) to our cluster expansion technique .",
    "more work would be needed to clarify and establish such a possibility .",
    "we note that spectral diffusion induced decoherence can not be characterized by a simple @xmath0 time since the hahn echo decay is not a simple exponential , and in fact , obeys different temporal power laws in the si : p and the gaas quantum dot systems .",
    "spectral diffusion is a pure dephasing process arising from the temporal ( non - markovian ) magnetic field fluctuations at the localized electron spin due to the nuclear spin dynamics , but it can not be parameterized by a single @xmath0 time except as a crude approximation . within this crude approximation",
    ", we find the spectral diffusion induced @xmath0 to be about @xmath394 for the si : p system and about @xmath395 for the gaas quantum dot system .",
    "but , this @xmath0 can be enhanced indefinitely ( up to tens of milliseconds ) in the si : p system through the isotopic purification of si ( i.e. , by removing @xmath5si nuclei from the system ) whereas in the gaas quantum dots , @xmath396 is essentially an absolute upper limit ( when using simple hahn echo refocusing ) since _ all _ ga and as nuclei isotopes have free spins contributing to the spectral diffusion and isotopic purification is impossible .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that although spin polarizing the nuclei ( e.g. , through the dynamic nuclear polarization technique ) would , in principle , suppress the nuclear induced spectral diffusion decoherence of electron spin , in practice , this would lead only to rather small enhancement of electron spin coherence since the presence of even a few nuclei with the `` wrong '' spin would cause nuclear pair flip - flop processes.@xcite    finally , we comment on the fact that the spectral diffusion process is quite a generic and general phenomenon in _ any _ spin decoherence problem with coupled spin dynamics ( e.g. electron and nuclear spins , different types of nuclear spins , etc . ) where the dynamics of one spin species has nontrivial ( i.e. , non - markovian ) temporal effects on the evolution of the spin dynamics of the other species .",
    "for example , a trivial ( but not often emphasized in the literature ) consequence of spectral diffusion consideration implies that in systems ( e.g. , si : p ; gaas quantum dots ) of interest to quantum computer architectures , the single flip of the localized electron spin will immediately decohere _ all _ the nuclear spins in its vicinity .",
    "thus the nuclear spin @xmath0 time in these systems can at most be the @xmath7 time for the electron spin !",
    "the typical low - temperature @xmath7 time for electron spins in the gaas quantum dots has been measured to be @xmath397 or so , and therefore the nucleus spin @xmath0 time would at most be @xmath397 in the gaas quantum dots , at least in the neighborhood of the localized electrons in the dot .",
    "the same consideration applies to the si : p system .",
    "we believe that the general quantum theoretical techniques developed in this paper will be helpful in the studies of the temporal dynamics of other coupled spin systems wherever one spin species could act as a `` decoherence bath '' for the other system .",

    "<S> we consider the decoherence of a single localized electron spin due to its coupling to the lattice nuclear spin bath in a semiconductor quantum computer architecture . in the presence of an external magnetic field and at low temperatures , the dominant decoherence mechanism is the spectral diffusion of the electron spin resonance frequency due to the temporally fluctuating random magnetic field associated with the dipolar interaction induced flip - flops of nuclear spin pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the electron spin dephasing due to this random magnetic field depends intricately on the quantum dynamics of the nuclear spin bath , making the coupled decoherence problem difficult to solve . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a formally exact solution of this non - markovian quantum decoherence problem which numerically calculates accurate spin decoherence at short times , which is of particular relevance in solid - state spin quantum computer architectures . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum cluster expansion method is developed , motivated , and tested for the problem of localized electron spin decoherence due to dipolar fluctuations of lattice nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> the method is presented with enough generality for possible application to other types of spin decoherence problems . </S>",
    "<S> we present numerical results which are in quantitative agreement with electron spin echo measurements in phosphorus doped silicon . </S>",
    "<S> we also present spin echo decay results for quantum dots in gaas which differ qualitatively from that of the phosphorus doped silicon system . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical results provide the ultimate limit on the spin coherence ( at least , as characterized by hahn spin echo measurements ) of localized electrons in semiconductors in the low temperature and the moderate to high magnetic field regime of interest in scalable semiconductor quantum computer architectures . </S>"
