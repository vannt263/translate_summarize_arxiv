    "the significant advances in implementing various protocols for qip can , in the future , lead to long - distance quantum communication @xcite or creation of a quantum computer @xcite . among many experimentally tested physical platforms ,",
    "optical implementations appear particularly promising .",
    "light is an ideal carrier of quantum information , as it can be transmitted over long distances through optical fibers or even in a free space .",
    "a crucial prerequisite for optical quantum information processing is the ability to generate and manipulate various highly non - classical and entangled states of light beams .",
    "entangled states of light are necessary for instance for quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum gates in quantum computing with linear optics @xcite , or quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "these wide potential applications motivate the effort aimed at developing and demonstrating preparation protocols for various interesting quantum states of light .",
    "single and two - photon fock states were conditionally prepared from two - mode squeezed vacuum by measuring the number of photons in the idler mode @xcite .",
    "schrdinger cat - like states were generated by subtracting a single photon from pulsed or continuous squeezed beams @xcite .",
    "photon - added coherent states were produced experimentally using down - conversion seeded with a weak coherent signal and conditioning on detection of a photon in the idler mode @xcite .",
    "schemes for preparation of arbitrary single mode states via repeated addition or subtraction of single photons have been suggested @xcite .",
    "a universal procedure for conditional preparation of arbitrary multimode states of light with linear optics , single photons , coherent states and single - photon detectors has been developed @xcite .",
    "a lot of attention has been paid to creation of two - mode n - photon entangled states , the so - called noon states , @xcite .",
    "it was shown theoretically and demonstrated experimentally that such states can be conditionally generated from input single - photon states by multiphoton interference in a properly tailored interferometer . in a similar way ,",
    "projection onto arbitrary noon - type state can be accomplished @xcite .",
    "the n - photon entangled states can find applications not only in quantum information processing , but can be also used for ultra - precise measurements @xcite or quantum lithography @xcite . for advanced applications , multimode entangled states will be required .",
    "however , the technique used for preparation of arbitrary two - mode n - photon states @xcite can not be immediately extended to multimode case .    in this paper , we show that we can exploit experimentally accessible two - photon entangled states generated in the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion to extend the group of states that can be prepared using only passive linear optics and single - photon detectors .",
    "we propose a feasible protocol for generation of an arbitrary quantum state of two photons in three optical spatial modes @xmath0 where the numbers in each bracket denote the number of photons in the first , second and third mode , respectively . to prepare an arbitrary state ( [ eq : target ] )",
    "we use a multiphoton interferometer , which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : general_interferometer ] .",
    "a two - mode two - photon state can be prepared in this way from a separable state @xmath1 as the input .",
    "this approach however fails if the number of modes becomes higher .",
    "we will show that using an entangled input state permits us to create arbitrary states of the form ( [ eq : target ] ) .",
    "we will then generalize our procedure to conditional generation of arbitrary multi - mode entangled two - photon state .",
    "the scheme is cheap in terms of required resources because it involves only two photons and vacuum ancillae which is a great practical advantage .",

    "vi . finally , sec .",
    "vii contains a brief summary of the main results and conclusions .",
    "first of all we prove that a separable input state is not sufficient for preparation of an arbitrary state of the form ( [ eq : target ] ) by the interferometric method sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : general_interferometer ] .",
    "we express the input state @xmath1 as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes creation operator for the @xmath4 mode and @xmath5 stands for the vacuum state .",
    "general interferometer performs linear transformation that can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 are elements of a unitary matrix @xmath8 . for future reference , we note that the interference of modes @xmath9 and @xmath10 on a beam splitter bs with amplitude transmittance @xmath11 and reflectance @xmath12 is governed by @xmath13 and a phase shifter ps shifts the phase of a single mode according to @xmath14",
    ". the separable state @xmath1 will be transformed as follows , @xmath15 conditional projection of all output ancillae onto vacuum then gives @xmath16 it is easy to verify that the class of achievable target states ( [ eq : factorised_cond ] ) is limited .",
    "for example it can be shown that the state @xmath17 can not be expressed in the factorized form ( [ eq : factorised_cond ] ) and is therefore not obtainable from separable state like @xmath1 by multiphoton interference using only vacuum ancillae .",
    "addition of single photon ancillae would make the preparation possible , but also experimentally more difficult @xcite .",
    "even with one fixed entangled state as the input , one can not prepare arbitrary state ( [ eq : target ] ) using only deterministic unitary transformations . to prove this ,",
    "let us consider two photons in @xmath18 optical modes .",
    "such quantum state is then determined by @xmath19 real parameters where @xmath20 denotes the number of combinations with repetitions of @xmath18 elements in @xmath21 classes .",
    "the term @xmath22 corrects the number of parameters due to normalization and irrelevant overall phase of the state . on the other hand , @xmath18-dimensional special unitary transformation represented by @xmath23",
    "complex matrix contains @xmath24 real parameters , where @xmath25 denotes the number of combinations without repetitions of @xmath18 elements in @xmath21 classes .",
    "the factor @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : unit_param ] ) accounts for the reduction of the number of free parameters due to normalization condition of each row of the matrix .",
    "the term @xmath27 represents correction due to condition of orthogonality of rows and the factor @xmath28 occurs since the determinant of a matrix belonging to the @xmath29 group is fixed and equal to @xmath30 .",
    "it is evident that for any @xmath31 the number of parameters specifying the quantum state is larger than the number of degrees of freedom allowed by unitary transformation .",
    "this results in the need of probabilistic non - unitary filtering operations in a fully general preparation scheme .",
    "here we show that by exploiting the two - photon entangled states generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion as a resource , we can conditionally generate arbitrary state of the form ( [ eq : target ] ) with only linear optics .",
    "the protocol can be divided in two phases : initialization phase and preparation phase .",
    "we begin by describing the first one .",
    "we use spontaneous parametric down - conversion to prepare an entangled pair of photons ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : init ] ) .",
    "the initial state of these photons can be written as @xmath32 where h and v denote state of single photon polarized horizontally or vertically , respectively . using two polarizing beam splitters that reflect vertical and transmit horizontal polarization we are able to obtain the four - mode state @xmath33 where",
    "the fock state basis is used .",
    "four numbers in each bracket denote the number of photons found in spatial modes @xmath30 through @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "half - wave plates hwp1 and hwp2 unify polarization states in all four modes",
    ". then the hong - ou - mandel interference @xcite takes place on balanced beam splitters bs1 and bs2 and the state of the photons changes to @xmath35 if we want to generate a three - mode state , then we simply omit the last mode .",
    "since in our protocol we post - select cases when two photons are present at the output of the preparation device , we can assume the effective initial two - photon state in the form @xmath36 which will be used in the second phase of the protocol .      in order to prepare an arbitrary state ( [ eq : target ] ) the state ( [ eq:3x200 ] )",
    "is fed into a multiport linear interferometer schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "the device is composed of passive linear optical elements such as beam splitters and phase shifters and involves filters f1 and f2 where the signal beams are attenuated by mixing them with auxiliary vacuum beams on beam splitters .",
    "the filtering operation is successful if the photons do not leak into the output auxiliary ports .",
    "this can be , in principle , verified by means of single - photon detectors placed on the auxiliary outputs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "however , such verification would require perfect detectors with unit efficiency .",
    "instead , we can utilize a simpler verification strategy relying on postselection . to prove that the scheme is working , one can set detectors on every output mode and look for double coincidences which herald successful preparation of the state .",
    "quantum state tomography @xcite could be used to completely characterize the generated state . in this case",
    "the target state is destroyed by the measurement .",
    "if the prepared state serves as an input for another scheme , one can post - select successful preparations at the output of such scheme .",
    "the parameters of the interferometer elements can be determined by `` reverse engineering '' of the target state .",
    "we let the target state propagate through the scheme in reverse and we successively get rid of all terms but the terms that are present in the state ( [ eq:3x200 ] ) .",
    "the reversal is easily done for beam splitters ( bs1 , bs2 and bs3 ) and phase shifters ( ps1 , ps2 and ps3 ) because they are represented by unitary transformations .",
    "filters f1 and f2 are also ( probabilistically ) reversible . once the reverse procedure finds correct parameters for all elements , the scheme is designed to generate the target state ( [ eq : target ] ) from the state ( [ eq:3x200 ] ) .    in the heisenberg picture , passive linear transformations can be described as linear unitary transformations of the creation operators , c.f .",
    "( [ eq : a_general_transform ] ) .",
    "every three - mode transformation can be decomposed into a sequence of two - mode and single - mode transformations corresponding to beam splitters and phase shifters @xcite .",
    "a fully general interferometric scheme can thus be constructed from these basic building blocks .",
    "such a device would provide a large number of degrees of freedom that can be exploited to optimize the success probability of the state preparation but at the same time its experimental realization would be quite difficult .",
    "we have therefore chosen some sort of compromise .",
    "our scheme includes all necessary elements needed for the preparation of arbitrary state ( [ eq : target ] ) and one additional beam splitter bs3 and phase shifter ps4 as optional optimization elements .",
    "these components can be removed and our scheme thus simplified at the expense of a reduced probability of successful state preparation .    in what follows we imagine that the state propagates backwards through the scheme from the right to the left .",
    "we successively eliminate all terms where two photons are present in two different spatial modes and end up with the state ( [ eq:3x200 ] ) as a result .",
    "first of all we get rid of the cross term @xmath37 with complex amplitude @xmath38 by destructive interference . to this end",
    ", we employ a unitary transformation u101 represented by a beam splitter bs2 with amplitude transmittance @xmath39 accompanied by phase shifter ps3 imposing phase shift @xmath40 . by a simple calculation , one finds that setting @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , the state @xmath37 is completely eliminated by destructive interference .",
    "the success rate of the protocol can be increased by the optimization beam splitter bs3 mixing modes @xmath30 and @xmath44 .",
    "amplitude transmissivity @xmath45 of bs3 should be chosen such that in the reverse propagation after transformation u101 the amplitude of the state @xmath1 is minimized .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath45 can be found numerically by a simple computer algorithm that maximizes the overall probability of success of the protocol .",
    "the reverse propagated state impinging on the filter f2 from the right can be written as @xmath46    if the term @xmath1 is not completely eliminated and @xmath47 we are forced to employ a filter f2 in modes @xmath30 and @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the creation operators for modes @xmath30 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the filtration by f2 can be expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is set so that the matrix can make part of a bigger unitary transformation on three modes . without loss of any generality",
    "we can assume that @xmath52 is real and positive because the phase shift between the two amplitudes is compensated by the phase shifter ps2 if we set @xmath53 .",
    "the amplitude transmittance of the beam splitters forming the filter f2 is equal to @xmath51 .",
    "the correct mixing of modes is achieved if the product of the amplitude reflectances @xmath54 of the two beam splitters is equal to @xmath55 .",
    "this yields a quadratic equation for @xmath51 whose solution reads @xmath56 .",
    "\\label{q2}\\ ] ] the filtering requires an ancilla vacuum mode and the transformation ( [ f1a ] ) is effectively implemented if no photon leaks into the output ancilla .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ f1a ] ) does not preserve canonical commutation relations because the operator of ancilla mode is omitted .",
    "this simplified mathematical description of the filter is nevertheless correct for our purposes .",
    "after filter f2 the state simplifies to @xmath57 to ensure correct state preparation , one has to compensate filtering of modes @xmath30 and @xmath44 by additional attenuation of the third mode by a beam splitter with amplitude transmissivity @xmath51 .",
    "the probability of success @xmath58 of the filter @xmath59 can be lower bounded as follows .",
    "the successful filtration during the state preparation procedure can be described by the transformation @xmath60 where the non - unitary operator @xmath61 depends on @xmath51 .",
    "we have @xmath62 from which we obtain the inequality @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the lowest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath65 . a straightforward calculation yields @xmath66 \\nonumber \\\\   & & -\\frac{1}{2}(1-q_2 ^ 2)^2\\sqrt{1 + 6q_2 ^ 4+q_2 ^ 8}.   \\label{mmin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be shown that @xmath64 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath51 which suggests that in order to maximize the success rate of the protocol we should maximize @xmath51 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ q2 ] ) that @xmath67 monotonically decreases as the ratio @xmath52 increases .",
    "it is therefore desirable to minimize @xmath68and maximize @xmath69 which is precisely the purpose of the beam splitter bs3 .",
    "let us now derive a lower bound on @xmath67 .",
    "the maximum of absolute values of the amplitudes specifying the state ( [ eq : target ] ) is greater or equal to @xmath70 . if the maximum amplitude corresponds to one of the states with two photons in a single mode then by simple relabeling of the modes we get @xmath71 .",
    "if this amplitude corresponds to mode with two photons in two different modes , say @xmath1 after possible re - labeling , then we may use balanced beam splitter bs3 together with proper phase shifts to reach amplitude @xmath72 . since the unitary operations u(bs3 ) and u101 are deterministic , the state ( [ stateprime ] ) is normalized and @xmath73 which implies @xmath74 . taking everything together , we find that @xmath75 can always be satisfied so that @xmath76 holds . if we plug in this lower bound into eq .",
    "( [ mmin ] ) we finally get @xmath77 .    in the next step of the protocol ,",
    "the term @xmath78 in the state ( [ psitwoprime ] ) is removed by a destructive interference between second and third modes .",
    "this is accomplished by a unitary transformation u011 which consists of a phase shifter ps1 imposing phase shift @xmath79 on the second mode and a beam splitter bs1 with transmittance @xmath80 mixing the second and third mode . the term @xmath81 is eliminated provided that @xmath82}{\\mathrm{re}[(\\gamma''+\\beta'')/\\eta '' ] } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\tan ( 2\\vartheta ) & = & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\eta''}{e^{-i\\phi}\\gamma''-e^{i\\phi}\\beta '' } ,    \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : condition_u011}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after the whole procedure we obtain the state @xmath83 which can be transformed by filters f1 into the state ( [ eq:3x200 ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath84 the overall success probability of filters f1 . in order to obtain the state ( [ psithree ] ) from the initial state ( [ eq:3x200 ] ) we in fact need to apply attenuation filters to only two modes . with probability",
    "@xmath85 the two photons are present in a mode which is not attenuated by f1 and , consequently , it holds that @xmath86 .",
    "parameters of all components are now determined . by proper inversion of the filters we obtain configuration which prepares the target state ( [ eq : target ] ) from the state ( [ eq:3x200 ] ) .",
    "the total success probability for the whole protocol is defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is un - normalized output state obtained from the normalized input state ( [ eq:3x200 ] ) .",
    "it holds that @xmath89 .",
    "to verify the functionality of our protocol , we have performed extensive numerical simulations of preparation of various states .",
    "an example of the results is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : test_amp ] which displays the probability of successful preparation for target states @xmath90 where @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "we can see that as @xmath92 increases the target state is `` shifting off '' the state ( [ eq:3x200 ] ) which is the product of the initialization phase .",
    "even though the probability decreases , it is still well above @xmath93 .",
    "it can be shown that for this particular class of states the best performance of the protocol is obtained by using a balanced optimizing beam splitter bs3 .",
    "this probability @xmath94 is however very sensitive to exact splitting ratio of the beam splitter when @xmath95 .",
    "it this case it is therefore more convenient for the experimental realization to use an unbalanced beam splitter with splitting ratio that corresponds to another local maximum of the success probability . even though this choice gives a slightly lower success probability , it makes the scheme more robust and tolerant to imprecision in the splitting ratio .    in another numerical simulation",
    "we have studied preparation probability @xmath94 for a more asymmetric single - parametric class of states @xmath96 where @xmath97 $ ] . the result ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : test_phase ] ) shows a symetric gauss - like function realising maximum of @xmath98 at @xmath99 and asymptotically aproaching minimum of @xmath100 for @xmath101",
    ".     states , the minimum success probability of the scheme reads @xmath102 .",
    "the average success probability is around @xmath103 . ]    finally , we present in fig .  [",
    "fig : hist ] a histogram of the success probability @xmath94 of the preparation protocol .",
    "this histogram was obtained by evaluating @xmath94 for @xmath104 randomly generated states .",
    "we can see that most of the states can be prepared with probability larger than @xmath105 .",
    "however , there is a small class of states that are hard to generate .",
    "the lowest success probability obtained by the numerical calculations reads @xmath102 which qualitatively agrees with the lower bound @xmath106 derived in the preceding section .",
    "so far we have explained how linear optics can be used to prepare an arbitrary state of two photons in three spatial modes .",
    "we now generalize our procedure to an arbitrary number of modes .",

    "we begin by employing non - degenerate spontaneous parametric down - conversion to produce correlated state of two photons in @xmath112 pairs of modes @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 the modes @xmath113 and @xmath114 can be for instance different directions on the cone of the emission from the crystal @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can pump the non - linear crystal with a sequence of @xmath116 ultra - short pulses and then the modes @xmath113 and @xmath114 correspond to @xmath110th time - bin @xcite .",
    "yet another option is to simultaneously pump @xmath116 nonlinear crystals .",
    "after down - conversion , the pairs of modes @xmath113 and @xmath114 are combined on @xmath116 balanced beam splitters and the hong - ou - mandel interference produces the state @xmath117    in the second part of the protocol , the @xmath108-mode two - photon state ( [ noon ] ) is injected into the interferometer shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gener ] . the parameters of the interferometer can be again determined by reverse engineering where we let the target state propagate backwards through the scheme and at each step we eliminate certain component of the state by destructive interference . in this way",
    "we finally obtain the state ( [ noon ] ) .",
    "we now describe the cycles of the protocol in more detail . in the first cycle",
    ", we get rid of all states with exactly one photon in the last mode .",
    "first we apply unitary transformation to the first and second mode .",
    "this transformation is equivalent to the transformation u101 from fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] and eliminates the term @xmath118 . next the second unitary transformation acting on the second and third mode eliminates the term @xmath119 .",
    "we continue in this fashion with only one exception .",
    "we do not use unitary transformation to mix the ( @xmath108 - 1)th and @xmath108th mode .",

    "fig : scheme ] , accompanied by attenuation of the first @xmath120 modes ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "this filter removes the term @xmath121 . at this stage ,",
    "all terms with exactly one photon in the last ( @xmath108th ) mode are eliminated and there is either zero or two photons in the last mode .",
    "for subsequent considerations it can be therefore neglected and we have effectively reduced the @xmath108-mode problem to ( @xmath108 - 1)-mode problem .    in the second cycle",
    "we apply the same strategy to eliminate all cross terms with one photon in the mode @xmath122 . repeating this procedure @xmath123 times we finally get back to the three - mode situation which we have already solved .",
    "the success probability of the protocol can be improved by employing optimizing beam splitters before each cycle .",
    "these beam splitters play the same role as bs3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] and they should combine the modes where the filter will be applied in a given cycle . the number of required two - mode operations that have to be implemented scales as @xmath124 with @xmath108 being the number of modes .",
    "the general scheme presented in the previous section can prepare any two - photon quantum state in an arbitrary number of modes .",
    "the experimental difficulty however increases considerably as the number of modes grows .",
    "if one is interested in preparation of specific class of quantum states then one could attempt to design a less general but simpler and experimentally more feasible scheme for this purpose . as an example of an important specific class of states we consider here the so - called two - photon four - mode klm states , @xmath125 these states were introduced by knill , laflamme , and milburn in the context of quantum computing with linear optics @xcite .",
