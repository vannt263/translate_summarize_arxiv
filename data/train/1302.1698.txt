    "the interior of a ns , where the density is very high , provides opportunities to apply and test the concepts of nuclear physics in order to elucidate properties such as ns mass and radius .",
    "these properties depend on the microscopic nature of the matter at high densities and can be corroborated with astrophysical observations @xcite .    in the recent years",
    ", several new observations have propelled several theories anda variety of models in a bid to understand the properties of ns @xcite . in ns matter",
    ", while considering the conservation of only charge and baryon numbers , antikaons , hyperons and quarks can appear inside the ns by a strangeness changing process . at intermediate densities , pions and antikaons ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) are most likely to condense . in a vacuum , pions are lighter than kaons , but this situation may be reversed in the dense medium due to strong interactions between mesons and nucleons @xcite .",
    "hence antikaon condensation becomes more important in the intermediate density range and affects the mass and radius of the ns significantly .",
    "as we approach the interior of the ns , density increases .",
    "the excitation energy of antikaons ( strangeness = @xmath31 ) decreases with density and hence at a sufficiently high density the antikaons are favoured to condense .",
    "many theoretical descriptions have considered only the @xmath0 condensation @xcite which is supposed to be dominant as it occurs at a relatively low density . with the onset of @xmath0 condensation , @xmath4 is the most preferred process , and hence the proton fraction rises dramatically and even exceeds the neutron fraction at higher densities @xcite . with the onset of @xmath5 condensation this scenario will change completely .",
    "there will be a competition between the processes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , resulting in a perfectly symmetric matter of nucleons and antikaons inside the neutron stars @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the presence of antikaons , initially proposed by glendenning and schaffner - bielich @xcite , with relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models has been carried out in @xcite . in most of these previous works ,",
    "the rmf parametrizations used were not tested rigorously in the case of finite nuclei .",
    "the recent parametrizations discussed in this work have been carefully developed and tested over the nuclear chart by explaining several nuclear properties @xcite and the experimentally determined eos for symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "hence , we are using more reliable models for the eos which turn out to be softer ( around the saturation density ) than those used in the previous works .",
    "it is quite well - known that a softer eos could lead to a lesser contribution from antikaons @xcite .",
    "we have shown in our earlier work @xcite that the eos from recent parameterizations , with higher order couplings , is not too soft to neglect the role of antikaons .",
    "in such a case we have shown that the mixed phase ( of kaonic and nonkaonic phases ) will not appear due to the softer eos .",
    "it has to be noted that it is not only the stiffness of eos but also that of the symmetry energy that is crucial in determining the onset of antikaon condensation ; hence their role in modifying the properties of ns .",
    "some of the recent parameterizations ( e.g. fsugold ) yield very soft symmetry energies and its effect in altering onset of @xmath0 and hence the properties of ns are discussed in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "this study introspects our earlier conclusions with the inclusion of @xmath1 which is a more realistic case @xcite .    for our calculations , we consider the effective field theory - motivated relativistic mean - field model ( e - rmf ) @xcite . in this model , the idea of renormalizability is abandoned and the effective lagrangian is expanded in powers of fields and its derivatives at a given order , with all the non - renormalizable couplings consistent with the underlying symmetries of qcd . in short , one can say that the e - rmf model comprises the standard rmf plus a few additional couplings .",
    "the rmf terms dominate at low density while the additional couplings dominate at high density . without forcing any change in the parameters initially determined from a few magic nuclei @xcite ,",
    "the e - rmf calculations explain finite nuclei and infinite matter in a unified way with a commendable level of accuracy in both cases @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see how the e - rmf description of ns changes with the inclusion of antikaons , which is the central subject of this work .    in section [ sec : model ] , we describe the lagrangian , field equations and the expression for energy density followed by a discussion on the constraints for the antikaon condensation , with the parameters used .",

    "[ fig : kaonenergy ] , it is evident that at a particular density , @xmath72 increases while @xmath73 decreases with the increase in neutron fraction .",
    "this difference is purely due to the contribution from the @xmath74 field [ eq .  ( [ ke ] ) ] and hence with a large neutron excess the @xmath0 condensation is less favoured when compared to @xmath1 .",
    "however , in neutron - rich matter , @xmath69 is larger and stiffer with density .",
    "this allows @xmath0 to condense at lower densities .",
    "apart from the usual dependence on @xmath75 , the onset of condensation of antikaons strongly depends on the parameters of the lagrangian especially for the higher order couplings @xcite . in case of @xmath0 ,",
    "this is due to the strong variation in the density dependence of @xmath68 and @xmath69 whose interplay determines the onset of @xmath0 condensation .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath68 is similar to that of the eos and @xmath69 varies in a way similar to the symmetry energy . so any change in the density dependence of eos or that of the symmetry energy will affect the onset as well as the effect of @xmath0 condensation . in general",
    ", @xmath1 can appear only at densities higher than the one at which @xmath0 condenses @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that only with @xmath0 condensation the proton population increases and with increasing density the matter becomes symmetric at a point where @xmath1 can start to contribute .",

    ", we need a large @xmath75 which results in a negligible population of leptons in the core of the ns .",
    "another interesting feature is the variation of radius of a 2@xmath86 ns in the presence of antikaons . to accommodate such exotic particles at a fixed maximum mass ( @xmath92 )",
    ", one should start with an eos which is stiffer and yields a larger maximum mass without exotic particles .",
    "the presence of an exotic core reduces the maximum mass whereas the corresponding radius ( @xmath93 ) may either increase or decrease . the antikaons can increase or decrease the central baryon density ( @xmath94 ) @xcite and hence @xmath93 ( @xmath95 ) , however only marginally . to accommodate more antikaons we need to start with a stiffer eos yielding larger @xmath92 and @xmath96 without antikaons .",
    "thus for a given maximum mass , the corresponding radius is more if we have more antikaons ( exotic particles ) .",
    "however , we may not observe stars extremely close to the maximum mass and hence the corresponding radius could vary . hence more work is needed to understand the sensitivity of the radius of massive ns to the presence of exotic particles . in this work",
    ", we have ignored the presence of hyperons that can affect the role of antikaons and the ns properties .",
    "the onset of some of hyperons ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) can be in the same density range corresponding to the onset of antikaons .",
    "hence the presence of hyperons can not only soften the eos further but could cause a strong interplay between the hyperons and antikaons , affecting each other s role on the eos",
