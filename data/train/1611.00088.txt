    "it is presently accepted that most stars form in clusters or groups , although the details of the cluster - formation process , especially the origin of their structural properties , remain a matter of active research ( see , e.g. , the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , in recent years , a number of structural properties of the clusters have been uncovered that still require an adequate theoretical understanding , such as : i ) the existence of a mass segregation in the clusters , with the most massive stars lying closer to the cluster s center @xcite ; ii ) the distribution of protostellar separations , which appears to have no characteristic scale @xcite ; iii ) the likely existence of an age gradient in clusters , with the youngest stars being located in the highest - density regions @xcite ; iv ) the apparent deficit of ob stars in some infrared dark clouds .",
    "numerical simulations have begun to offer some insight about these properties .",
    "@xcite have concluded , from a suite of simulations of self - gravitating , decaying isothermal turbulence , that the most massive stars form in situ at the cluster centers , rather than `` sinking '' there through dynamical interactions in the cluster itself .",
    "however , they gave no physical explanation as to why the most massive stars should form there .",
    "more recently , @xcite have suggested , by comparing multi - wavelength observations of stellar clusters with numerical simulations , that clusters form by mergers of `` subcluster '' structures , although again no explanation of why such mergers should occur is provided .",
    "observationally , the presence of subunits of somewhat different ages in the clusters has also been pointed out by @xcite .",
    "a physical mechanism capable of providing a unifying scenario to these properties is that of global , hierarchical molecular cloud collapse , advanced by .",
    "the latter authors noted that , if molecular clouds ( mcs ) are assembled by large - scale colliding streams of warm , atomic gas that rapidly condenses into the cold atomic phase , then they quickly become jeans - unstable and begin to collapse globally .",
    "moreover , the turbulence induced by the collision of the streams causes moderately supersonic turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the cold gas , which produces a multi - scale spectrum of density fluctuations , where small - scale , large - amplitude ( ssla ) density fluctuations are superposed on larger - scale , smaller - amplitude ( lssa ) ones . since these density fluctuations are nonlinear , the denser ssla fluctuations have shorter free - fall times than the lssa ones , therefore completing their collapse earlier .",
    "this process is therefore similar to @xcite fragmentation , except that the density fluctuations are of turbulent origin and therefore nonlinear . in this sense ,",
    "the process is also similar to the mechanism of `` gravo - turbulent fragmentation '' , except that the cloud is _ not _ globally supported by turbulence , and the turbulent fluctuations do not collapse directly , but rather just plant the seeds for subsequent , local , scattered collapses as the cloud contracts globally @xcite . in what follows , we will refer to this intermediate scenario between hoyle and gravoturbulent fragmentation as `` global hierarchical collapse '' ( ghc ) .",
    "this scenario also predicts that the star formation rate ( sfr ) in mcs evolves ( initially increasing ) over time , as a consequence of the increase of the mean density of the clouds as they go through global gravitational collapse @xcite . assuming that massive stars do not form until the sfr is high enough that the imf is sampled up to high masses , then massive stars form late in the global process , and when they do , they begin to disrupt their parent clouds through their feedcak ( winds , ionising radiation , sn explosions ) , reducing the sfr again .",
    "@xcite presented a smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) numerical simulation of cloud formation and evolution in the context of ghc that showed the formation of filamentary structures with embedded clumps . in that simulation ,",
    "the filaments constitute river - like structures , through which material flows from the extended cloud environment to the dense cores where star formation occurs .",
    "when the filaments are sufficiently dense , fragmentation occurs within them as the gas flows along them into the most massive cores .",
    "this implies that the filaments supply the dense cores with a mixture of stars and gas .",
    "this kind of flow was also observed ( although it was not discussed ) in a similar simulation presented by using the adaptive mesh refinement code art @xcite that included a simplified treatment of radiative transfer and a prescription to form stellar particles ) . ]",
    "( sps ) that allows imposing a power - law sp mass function with a slope similar to that of @xcite .",
    "this implies that , contrary to the situation in the simulation by @xcite , the clusters formed in the simulation of paper i , as well as their surrounding gas , are subject to realistic dynamics , which allows investigating the evolution of the clusters from their formation to the time when they disperse their surrounding gas .",
    "there exist many numerical studies of cluster formation , focusing on issues such as their stellar mass function , the correlation function of the spatial stellar distribution and cluster boundedness , and the formation of binaries ; the effect of feedback on producing massive stars and on destroying their parent clumps ; and the energy balance and rotation of the cluster as a function of the initial turbulence level in the parent cloud @xcite .    in this work , instead , we aim to describe the process of assembly and early evolution of the clusters as a consequence of ghc . to this end , we study a cluster formed in the simulation labeled laf1 in paper i , focusing on the resulting spatial structure of the cluster . in sec.[sec : model ] we briefly describe the numerical simulation , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : cluster ] we describe the criteria for defining the cluster and stellar groups , both in terms of the origin of their members as well as from their instantaneous positions .",
    "next , in sec.[sec : results ] we present our results concerning the assembly from subunits brought in by the ghc , as well as the resulting structure of the clusters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our results and compare them with existing observations , and in sec.[sec : conclusions ] we give a summary and some conclusions .",
    "the numerical simulation used in this work comes from the set performed in paper i with the hydrodynamics+n - body adaptive refinement tree ( art ) code of @xcite .",
    "the physical processes included are self - gravity , parameterized heating and cooling ( sec.[sec : hcrates ] ) , star formation with an imposed but realistic imf ( sec.[sec : sf ] ) , and simplified radiative transfer for the feedback from massive - star ionising radiation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : feedback ] ) .",
    "magnetic fields are neglected . for more details ,",
    "we refer the reader to paper i.      the simulation represents the head - on collision of two cylindrical streams in the warm neutral medium .",
    "the streams each have a radius of 64 pc and a length 112 pc , and each is traveling at a speed of @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical box ( including the streams ) initially has a uniform density @xmath1 and temperature @xmath2 k , implying an adiabatic sound speed of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the streams move with a mach number of 0.8 with respect to the sound speed in the initial uniform background medium .",
    "the simulation uses a base resolution of @xmath4 grid cells , and allows for 5 refinement levels , reaching a maximum resolution equivalent to @xmath5 , with a minimum cell size of 0.0625 pc , or @xmath6 13 000 au .",
    "the refinement is based on a `` constant mass '' criterion , so that a cell size is refined when its mass exceeds @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that the grid cell size @xmath8 scales with density @xmath9 as @xmath10 .",
    "once the maximum refinement level is reached , no further refinement is performed , and the cell s mass can reach much larger values because of the probabilistic sf scheme ( sec .  [ sec : sf ] ) .",
    "note that this constant - cell - mass refinement criterion does not conform to the so - called _ jeans criterion _ @xcite of resolving the jeans length with at least 4 grid cells .",
    "those authors cautioned that failure to do this might result in spurious , numerical fragmentation .",
    "however , we do not consider this a cause for concern since , as will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sf ] , our star formation prescription allows us to choose the stellar - particle mass distribution , and tune it to a @xcite value .",
    "we use heating ( @xmath11 ) and cooling ( @xmath12 ) functions of the form @xmath13 these functions are fits to the various heating and cooling processes considered by @xcite , as given by equation ( 4 ) of @xcite , with the typographical corrections noted in @xcite . with these heating and cooling laws ,",
    "the gas is thermally unstable in the density range @xmath14 .",
    "no chemistry tracking is performed , and so the gas is assumed to be all atomic , with a mean particle weight @xmath15 .",
    "our simulation employs a probabilistic star formation prescription such that , if a grid cell reaches a number density @xmath16 , where  is a density threshold , then an sp of fixed mass @xmath17 may be placed in the cell with a probability @xmath18 every timestep of the root ( coarsest ) grid .",
    "if the sp is created , it acquires half of the gas mass of the parent cell .",
    "unlike standard sink particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our sps do not accrete .",
    "however , since our prescription for sf is probabilistic , once the highest refinement level is reached in a cell , it actually continues to accrete from the surrounding material , and grows in mass and density until an sp is actually placed in it .",
    "this implies that the accretion is performed in the gas phase , rather than onto the particles .",
    "serendipitously , it was found in paper i that this prescription allows the sps to form with a power - law mass distribution , whose slope can be tuned by varying the value of @xmath18 , at a given maximum resolution . in paper",
    "i it was reported that setting @xmath19 at the resolution used in our simulation caused the sp power - law mass distribution to attain an exponent of @xmath20 , thus being similar to the classical salpeter value .",
    "we set the threshold density for sp formation at @xmath21 , which corresponds to a cell mass of @xmath22 at the highest refinement level .",
    "thus , the minimum possible sp mass is @xmath23 . with this prescription",
    ", the most massive sp formed in this simulation has @xmath24 .",
    "note , however , that our imposed imf is a strict power law , and thus the most probable stellar mass is also the minimum .",
    "this implies that we are missing the low - mass ( @xmath25 ) side of the actual imf , implying that we are missing about half of the total number of stars , and that their corresponding mass ( 2030% of the total mass ) is deposited instead into the stars that do get formed in the simulation .",
    "we discuss the implications of this in sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] .",
    "our simulation thus contains sps that represent individual stars ( not clusters or groups ) , with a realistic mass distribution above the most probable stellar mass .",
    "this allows the dynamics of the sps to be reasonably representative of the forming cluster dynamics , contrary to the case when the particles masses correspond to those of small groups , of up to a few hudreds of solar masses . in that case",
    ", low - mass particles can suffer exceedingly strong encounters with the massive particles , and thus acquire unrealistically high velocities .      in our simulation ,",
    "the feedback effect of the ionising stars on the mc is non - local , using a simplified radiative transfer prescription to model the formation and evolution of a hii region around an sp . as a zeroth - order approximation",
    ", we assume a uniform `` line - of - sight '' ( los ) characteristic density @xmath26 in the hii region , with a value equal to the geometric mean between the density of the cell containing the sp and that of the target cell .",
    "moreover , for any given star we assume an ionising flux @xmath27 taken from the tabulated data provided by @xcite .",
    "we then compute the corresponding strmgrem radius , @xmath28 , given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 s@xmath32 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient .    at each time step , we search for all cells surrounding every sp particle whose distances to it are smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "for each target cell that satisfies this condition , we set its temperature to @xmath33 and turn off the cooling there .",
    "the cell will remain so during the whole lifetime of the star , which is determined by its mass @xmath34 as @xmath35 as explained in paper i , for stars more massive than @xmath36 , this time is a fit to the stellar lifetimes by @xcite , while for stars with masses lower than that , it represents the fact that the duration of the stellar - wind phase is @xmath37 myr , roughly independently of mass .",
    "this also means that we are representing the effect of the winds and outflows of low mass stars by an ionization prescription .",
    "while this is clearly only an approximation , we do not expect it to have much impact on our calculations , since the main source of feedback energy at the level of gmcs is the ionization feedback from massive stars @xcite .",
    "although highly simplified , this prescription was tested in paper i against the known analytic formula for the evolution of @xmath38 in a uniform medium @xcite and shown to agree within 30% .",
    "this , we believe , is accurate enough given our interest in large - scale molecular cloud evolution and the associated cluster dynamics at early stages of assembly , rather than on the structural details of the ionised regions .",
    "one crucial step for the present study is the membership of stars to a given group or cluster .",
    "we now discuss our procedure of choice .",
    "observationally , the identification and membership definition of embedded stellar clusters is intrinsically a complex task , complicated by ambiguities and uncertainties , since the clusters do not have well defined edges , contamination by field stars is difficult to quantify , and faint members may be difficult to identify . in our case , the origin of the stars in the simulations is known , and this allows a classification of the stars by site of origin .",
    "however , this information is unavailable to observations , which instead must proceed by first identifying the cluster as a stellar surface density excess , and then define its members mainly on a statistical basis , by comparison with star counts in nearby control fields off the cluster @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "in the simulation there are no `` field '' stars , but only stars from clusters formed at some other locations in the cloud .    for the purpose of defining a cluster or group by location at early times",
    ", we use the well known friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "this is convenient at early stages , when the first groups of stars are well separated and the stars are easy to tag as part of a group that has formed at a certain time and location .",
    "however , note that , because of the hierarchical structure of the clusters , and [ sec : results ] . ]",
    "the number and stellar content of the resulting groups depends on the value of the so - called `` linking parameter '' passed to the algorithm .",
    "this parameter is a measure of the distance out to which neighbors are searched . at early times",
    ", the separation between groups is easily determined by eye , and the linking parameter can then be chosen to match the visual classification .    at later times , however , the groups change their size by dynamical interactions between their members , and moreover new stars continue to form in the same region , or in its outskirts , making it necessary to suitably define the regions size in order to determine stellar membership to a group .",
    "we thus define the radius of a group at a given time by performing an iterative process :    1 .   considering only the stars that were part of the group in the previous snapshot , we measure the distance from their center of mass to the most distant star .",
    "if this distance is less than twice the distance from the center to the second most distant star , we consider the distance to the most distant star as the radius of the group .",
    "otherwise , we consider the most distant star as a `` runaway star '' and take the radius of the group as the distance from its center to the second most distant star .",
    "next , we assign the new stars ( those formed in the period of time between the actual snapshot and the previous one ) to the group whose center of mass is closest to them .",
    "3 .   finally , including the new stars , we recompute the center of mass , size ( @xmath39 ) , total mass ( @xmath40 ) , and total number of stars ( @xmath41 ) of the group .",
    "we also compute the age of the group , @xmath42 , as the time elapsed since the moment when the group was first defined .",
    "however , neighbouring groups generally approach each other ( as part of the large - scale collapse ) and often they merge .",
    "we say that a new group has formed by the merger of two former groups when the distance between their centers of mass is smaller than the larger of the two radii . at that point",
    ", we consider that the earlier subgroups disappear . in general",
    ", we expect this process to operate at all scales in our simulation , with groups in turn forming from subgroups , and so on , in a hierarchical and self - similar manner .",
    "in this simulation , three main clusters form , two of which are sufficiently massive to clear out the dense gas around them on a timescale @xmath43 myr since the formation of the first stars ( from @xmath44 myr to @xmath45 myr in the evolution of the simulation ) .",
    "stars begin to form at @xmath46 myr , and the first hii  regions appear at @xmath47 myr .",
    "specifically , at @xmath48 myr , the dense gas has been cleared from a radius of @xmath49 pc around the clusters .",
    "figure [ fig : sim_imgs ] shows one snapshot of the simulation , at @xmath50 myr into the evolution , in which two hii  regions , surrounding the two most massive clusters , can be seen , while the filamentary structure of the cloud is still noticeable in general . the clusters themselves have formed along the main filamentary structures in the cloud , and contain @xmath51@xmath52 .",
    "note also that the structure of the most massive cluster retains the filamentary shape of its parent cloud , similarly to , for example , the structure observed in the orion a cloud .",
    "this similarity in fact is not limited to the filamentary shape , but also includes the fact that the filament has a larger concentration of stars in one end . in a future paper",
    "we plan to quantitatively explore the stucture and kinematics of these observed and simulated clusters .",
    "the crucial effect of the ghc scenario is that the filaments constitute part of the large - scale gravitational collapse , funneling gas into the cores within them , as observed by @xcite in a numerical simulation of cloud formation and collapse .",
    "moreover , these authors observed a hierarchy of collapses within the filaments , so that _ small clumps , which are collapsing locally , and sometimes forming stars already , are themselves falling onto larger - scale ones _ , similarly to the `` conveyor belt '' scenario proposed by @xcite for the gas stream in the central molecular zone .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : imgs_clus2 ] , which shows a series of snapshots around the second most massive cluster ( hereafter , `` cluster 2 '' , located in the upper left part of the cloud ) among those seen in fig .",

    "also , at this time , a third group is seen to begin forming in the far left part of the filament , containing only one star at that time , although by @xmath61 myr it already contains several stars ( not shown ) .    the effect of the feedback is also worth noting . already by @xmath58 myr",
    ", the section of the filament connecting the two clusters is seen to be partially disrupted , and some gas is being expelled from the clump containing the main group .",
    "however , accretion along the filament is seen to have replenished this section of the filament at @xmath62 myr , although the other side of the filament is now seen to be in the process of dispersal .",
    "finally , by @xmath54 myr , the filament is seen to be in the process of dispersal on both sides of the cluster .",
    "figure [ fig : imgs_clus2b ] then shows the late stages of the evolution of this cluster . by @xmath63",
    "myr the filament is seen to have been dispersed out to distances @xmath64 pc , and by @xmath65 myr , a large hii  region , of diameter @xmath66 pc has formed , although the group on the left retains some of its gas , and a new group has formed in an `` pillar '' that constitutes the remainder of the filament .",
    "also , along this filamentary structure , yet another group is seen to have formed ( at the far right of the image ) . by @xmath67 myr ,",
    "most of the dense gas has been cleared from the region , and the cluster is seen to consist of four groups , two of them almost devoid of gas ( `` naked '' ) and two of them still embedded in their respective clumps .                            from the above description , it becomes clear that the clusters in this simulation are assembled by means of a hierarchical process , in which subunits formed at slightly different locations and times merge as they fall into a large - scale potential well , _ feeding the central clump with both stars and gas_. in the following sections we discuss various implications of this mechanism .",
    "the resulting evolution of cluster 2 is illustrated in fig.[fig : cluster_evol ] , which shows the projected positions of the stellar particles on the @xmath68 plane at times @xmath69 , 21.44 , 22.40 , and 25.34 myr in the _ top left , top right , bottom left , and bottom right panels _",
    ".    in this cluster , stars begin to form at @xmath70 myr and fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_evol ] shows that they are assembled into a cluster in such a way that at @xmath69 myr we identify two subgroups ( hereafter , groups 1 and 2 ; see the _ top left panel _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_evol ] ) of what will later become a larger , merged group ( group 1 - 2 ) .",
    "we use square symbols to identify stars that belong to group 1 , and filled circles for stars belonging to group 2 .",
    "furthermore , we color them according to their age as shown in the labels and qualitatively represent their masses by the symbol size , with larger symbols indicating larger masses .",
    "the green and red circles represent the group radii at each time , computed as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : cluster ] , with the dashed circles representing the size out to the most distant star , and the solid circles representing the distance to the second most distant star . in",
    "what follows , we use the distance to the second most distant star as the radius of group 1 - 2 , because the first most distant one is clearly `` running away '' from the group .",
    "finally , we use larger symbols to represent more massive stars , and smaller symbols to represent lower - mass stars .",
    "thus , even at these early stages , we can see that _ the more massive and younger stars tend to be near the centers of the groups_.             from fig .  [ fig : cluster_evol ] it is clearly seen that , at these early stages , the groups are undergoing expansion , and that star formation continues within them .",
    "by @xmath71 myr , both groups have similar sizes , masses , and number of stars , and they have undergone a large enough expansion that their merger appears inevitable .",
    "the formerly `` most distant '' star of group 2 is now far away from the center of either group . by our definition ,",
    "the merger occurs at @xmath72 myr , forming the new group 1 - 2 .",
    "we have kept the circular and square symbols to indicate the original group membership of the stars in the merged group .",
    "triangles now represent stars born in the new group 1 - 2 .",
    "thus , this new group contains stars that were born at somewhat different times and locations .    for later times , we continue to track the evolution of this and other , new groups appearing in a 10-pc box around group 1 - 2 , and by @xmath73 myr , we now find a system of groups with different ages , masses , and sizes ( _ bottom right panel _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_evol ] ) .",
    "these groups lie approximately in a straight line , because they formed in the filament feeding the main clump . eventually , as these groups expand and approach each other , they finally become part of what we refer to as the whole cluster 2 , as seen in the _ bottom right panel _ of fig.[fig : imgs_clus2b ] , although the subunits are still partially distinguishable at that time ( @xmath74 myr ) .      as mentioned in the introduction , one fundamental implication of the ghc scenario",
    "is that the sfr of star - forming clouds must increase in time until the time when massive stars begin to appear and to destroy their parent mc @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : sfr_evol ] shows the evolution of the sfr in groups 1 and 2 , as well as in the merged group 1 - 2 . except for group 2 , in whose parent cloud the sfr starts relatively high and then decreases , for groups 1 and 1 - 2 the trend of increasing sfr is observed .",
    "moreover , the sfr for the merged group 1 - 2 is much larger than the maximum value reached in group 2 before the merger , so the increase of the sfr also holds for the system of groups 1 and 2 combined , before and after their merger .        assuming that massive stars do not form in a region until the sfr is locally high enough to sample the imf up to large masses , the increase of the sfr implies that the massive stars should tend to appear late in the evolution of star - forming regions .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig : age - mass ] , which shows the mass of the stars _",
    "vs. _ their age at @xmath54 and @xmath75 myr . at both times",
    ", it is clearly seen that the oldest stars have the lowest masses , and that , as the age decreases , the range of stellar masses extends to larger values .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cum_mass_hist ] , which shows the cumulative mass distribution of groups 1 , 2 , and 1 - 2 at various times .",
    "it is seen from this figure that the relative abundance of massive stars increases over time , especially after groups 1 and 2 have merged .",
    "the ghc mechanism implies that each star - forming site is locally undergoing collapse while simultaneously it is falling into larger - scale potential wells .",
    "moreover , since the small - scale regions are forming stars on their own , this process in turn implies that the larger scales are fed both gas and stars ( cf .",
    "[ sec : global_evol ] ) from the surrounding infalling material . also , the small - scale regions fall into the larger - scale ones mostly along filaments @xcite .",
    "an important consequence of this `` mixed '' ( gas+stars ) infall is that the ensemble of stars constitutes a non - dissipative `` fluid '' that conserves the kinetic energy of the infalling motions .",
    "thus , the stars formed _ before _ reaching the large - scale collapse center should exhibit a velocity dispersion corresponding to their motions as they were infalling to the center of the large - scale potential well . in turn",
    ", this implies that older stars should reach somewhat larger distances from the center of a group or cluster that has undergone mergers than the stars formed _ in situ _ in this merged clump , where the gas from which they inherit their velocity dispersion has probably been shocked and thus has lost some of the infall kinetic energy .         figure [ fig : age_profile ]",
    "shows the age of the stellar particles as a function of their distance to the center of mass of cluster 2 at @xmath76 myr .",
    "it is seen that all of the youngest stars ( @xmath77 , and in particular several stars with @xmath78 myr ) , are located within the central 0.5 pc of the cluster .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the observation that the youngest stars appear tightly clustered around core - like or filamentary star - forming regions .    instead , at larger distances ( @xmath79 pc )",
    ", there are no particles with @xmath80 myr .",
    "these older stars are the ones that formed in groups 1 and 2 , prior to their merging .",
    "this can also be seen in the _ bottom left _",
    "panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_evol ] , which shows that the stars farther from the center of group 1 - 2 are all represented by circles and squares ( i.e. , formed previously to the merger ) and by green and cyan colors , denoting ages between 1 and 4 myr , while the stars clustered near the center have ages @xmath81 myr , as indicated by their black - colored symbols .    on the other hand",
    ", we also notice in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_profile ] that the inner 0.5 pc of the cluster also contains several old stars , and in particular , the oldest ones ( @xmath82 23.5 myr ) .",
    "this suggests that some of the stars formed previously to the merger have already had @xmath83-body interactions with the other stars in the region , and thus have transferred their excess kinetic energy to other stars in the cluster .",
    "this is facilitated because these old stars have low masses , so that they are strongly affected by interactions with more massive ones . indeed , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sfr ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : age - mass ] ) , the oldest stars have masses near the peak of the imf , which in our case is also the minimum stellar mass ( cf .  sec .  [",
    "sec : sf ] ) .",
    "also , as mentioned in secs .",
    "[ sec : intro ] and [ sec : sfr ] , another implication of the ghc is that the sfr increases in each star - forming site until feedback begins to destroy the gas supply onto it , at which point the sfr begins to decline there , and perhaps shut off completely . using a semi - analytic model for the evolution of collapsing clouds and their sfr , @xcite showed that this acceleration of the sf at each star - forming site implies that the age histogram of the site before a few myr of its destruction is characterized by a large peak of very young ( age @xmath84 myr ) and a small tail of older ( up to several myr ) stars , similarly to the age histograms of embedded clusters in various nearby mcs @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : age_hist ] shows the age histogram of the stars in groups 1 and 2 at various times , as the clumps that embed them merge and continue to form stars . at @xmath85 myr ,",
    "the two clumps and their embedded groups are still separate , and a histogram for each group is shown . at @xmath86 myr , the two clumps and their embedded groups have already merged , and thus a single histogram is shown .",
    "it is seen that , at this time , the most numerous stars are those less than 1 myr old .",
    "neverthless , there are also a few stars up to nearly 4 myr old .",
    "this indicates an acceleration of sf during the first @xmath87 myr of evolution of cluster 2 . at later times ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 myr ) , the number of young stars decreases , while the most numerous stars are those formed around @xmath90 myr .",
    "this indicates a decline of the sfr after this time due to the onset of gas dispersal by the feedback .",

    "it can be seen that all but one of the stars with mass @xmath91 , and all stars with @xmath92 are located within @xmath93 pc of the computed center of the cluster .",
    "only one star with @xmath94 is located at @xmath95 pc from the cluster s center of mass",
    ". however , close inspection of the time sequence outlined by the various images of fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_evol ] shows that this is a runaway star formed in , and ejected from , group 1 before the merger .",
    "this star is represented by the cyan squared symbol lying on the green solid circle in the _ top right _ panel [ @xmath96 myr ] of fig.[fig : cluster_evol ] and on the solid orange circle in the _ bottom left _ [ @xmath97 myr ] panel .",
    "thus , this star is just `` flying by '' the cluster . instead",
    ", the other massive stars in group 1 - 2 have formed _ in situ _ , as indicated by the triangular shape of their symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_evol ] .    also , the other massive stars are represented by symbols of white and cyan colors , and with triangular shapes , indicating that those stars are younger ( @xmath98 myr ) , and formed _ in situ _ in the merged group 1 - 2 .",
    "thus , we conclude that , except for the star that is `` passing by '' , the massive stars have formed after the merger of groups 1 and 2 to form group 1 - 2 , thus being younger and tightly clustered near the group center .",
    "another feature of the cluster evolution seen in figs.[fig : age_profile ] and [ fig : mass_profile ] is that the cluster expands as it evolves , increasing its radius from @xmath99 pc at @xmath54 myr to @xmath100 pc at @xmath101 myr .",
    "the reason for this is not totally clear",
    ". it can be due in part to the fact that the gaseous material is beginning to be expelled from the clump , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : imgs_clus2 ] and [ fig : imgs_clus2b ] , and in part to the fact that the velocity dispersion of the older stars , formed in the scattered ssla regions that have fallen into the lssa one , corresponds to the large - scale potential well , not that of the local star - forming site ( cf .",
    "[ sec : age_distr ] ) , causing the cluster to expand to a size representative of this somewhat larger energy .",
    "we now discuss the hierarchical structure of the cluster itself , resulting from the process of ghc of its parent cloud .",
    "figure [ fig : hier_clus ] shows the stars belonging to the cluster at time @xmath74 myr , first as a whole , and then as identified by a friends - of - friends algorithm using three different values of the `` linking parameter '' @xmath102 , which determines how far neighbours are searched in order to identify a group .",
    "we see that , using a small value of the parameter ( @xmath103 , _ top right _ panel ) , 10 tight groups are identified ( denoted by the different colors ) , while using larger values ( @xmath104 and 2 , _ bottom left _ and _ bottom right _ panels ) , respectively 9 and 4 are identified , each group being significantly more extended .",
    "we also note that , at the lowest value , @xmath105 , a whole group of moderately scattered stars is left out , which is nevertheless identified as a group at higher values .",
    "these results show that the structure of the cluster resulting from the global , hierarchical contraction of the cloud , is inherently `` nested '' , consisting of structures within structures within structures , reflecting the structure of the parent cloud , which in turn is a consequence of its multi - scale , hierarchical collapse .",
    "we can summarise the discussion in the previous section as follows .",
    "the underlying assumption for interpreting the emerging properties of the clusters formed in the scenario of ghc is that first proposed in @xcite , namely that massive stars only form in sites where the local sfr is high enough that the imf can be sampled to correspondingly large stellar masses .",
    "conversely , the most common stars in low - sfr sites should be those at the peak of the imf .",
    "this is , of course , a fully probabilistic interpretation of the imf , and it does not address the physical mechanisms responsible for the development of the imf itself . however , it allows a framework for understanding the assembly of the clusters .    also , under the assumption that structures of all scales are collapsing , as required by the ghc , at a given density ( and therefore , a given free - fall time ) , more massive clumps are expected to have higher sfrs , if the sfr is given , to first order , by the ratio of the clump mass to its free - fall time .",
    "our simulation mimics these hypotheses , due to the probabilistic scheme used for the formation of a stellar particle .",
    "the longer it takes for a particle to form , the more massive it will be , since the cell in which it forms continues to accrete and becomes more massive , without further refinement , and then the particle forms with half the mass of the cell .",
    "but , as shown in figure 1 of paper i , the probability of being able to wait very long times before forming a stellar particle is very low , and so the probability of forming of a very massive star is also very low .",
    "thus , our simulation is expected to generally only form massive stars when the local sfr is very high , although there can be a few exceptions to this pattern .",
    "finally , in the ghc scenario , the low - mass , small - scale but large - amplitude ( ssla ) star - forming sites should appear earlier in the evolution of the cloud , because of their shorter free - fall times , while the high - mass , larger - scale , smaller - amplitude ( lssa ) sites should appear later . moreover",
    ", the low - mass sites should be falling into the trough of the gravitational potential well of the high - mass ones .",
    "however , low - mass sites continue to appear at all times in the filaments that feed the massive clumps until the filaments are destroyed by the feedback .",
    "thus , the low mass stars formed in the low - mass , infalling clumps share the clumps infall velocity , and thus should have larger velocity dispersions than the stars formed in the main , massive clump , which can have both low or high masses .",
    "the above considerations imply a number of properties of the resulting clusters :    1 .",
    "the oldest stars tend to have low masses",
    ". however , the converse is not necessarily true : low - mass stars in general can be either young or old .",
    "this trend is shown in the _ top _ panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : age - mass ] , which shows the mass _ vs. _ the age of the stars in the cluster at times @xmath97 and 23.66 myr .",
    "the oldest stars have larger velocities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v - age ] , _ left _ panel ) , and consequently , they may be encountered at larger distances from the local star - forming site ( fig .  [ fig : age_profile ] ) .",
    "the most massive stars appear later ( a few myr ) in the evolution of the clump ensemble , when various ssla sites have merged to form a lssa site .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : cum_mass_hist ] , which gives the cumulative stellar mass histogram for groups 1 and 2 , independently and combined , at various times . as time proceeds , progressively larger fractions of the stars are seen to be massive .",
    "4 .   the sfr increases during the early stages of the cluster assembly , until the time when massive stars begin to form . after this time , the sfr decreases , as the ionising feedback from the massive stars begins to destroy the clump and its filamentary gas supply .",
    "this is seen in the evolution of the age histogram , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_hist ] .",
    "the oldest stars constitute a minority , since the sfr initially increases with time .",
    "however , after the appearance of ob stars that can partially or completely destroy the local clump and its supplying filaments , the sfr decreases again , and thus stars younger than the age of the oldest massive stars should be less abundant as well , as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_hist ] .    note that these properties refer to regions of sizes a few parsecs and ages of at least a few myr , and so it specifically does _ not _ refer to the local and instantaneous stellar production in a single clump , for which our simulation can not discern whether massive stars form first or last , or how long does it take to build a massive star .",
    "also , note that young star - forming regions may consist of several low - mass local star - forming sites , and contain no large - scale site yet .",
    "this situation corresponds to times where the first low - mass sites have not yet merged to form a more massive one .",
    "our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with recent observational results on the age and mass distributions of young stellar objects in star - forming regions . in particular , @xcite have recently reported the existence of age gradients in the stellar populations of various massive star - forming regions , such that the youngest stellar objects are located in the obscured regions of molecular clouds , intermediate - age objects are located in revealed clusters , and the oldest objects are found in distributed populations .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with our result that the oldest objects can be found at large distances from the cluster s center due to their larger velocity dispersion , in turn due to their formation far from it , so that their velocities include the component from their infall onto the central massive clump .",
    "instead , younger objects formed in the clump lack this component of the velocity , and these are characterised by somewhat lower velocites .",
    "also , the larger velocity dispersion of the older objects predicted by the ghc scenario has been observed by @xcite in the orion a cloud .",
    "@xcite considered several possible scenarios that could lead to the age segregation they observed .",
    "of these , the one closest to the mechanism of hierarchical assembly by ghc is their scenario b , since it invokes the acceleration of sf as proposed by @xcite , which is consistent with our scenario @xcite .",
    "however , the similarity between ghc and scenario b of @xcite is not complete , since they did not consider the accretion of both stars and gas onto the trough of the large - scale potential well .",
    "in addition , @xcite have concluded that the cloud complex known as the m17 southwest extension ( m17 swex ) appears to be lacking very massive stars in comparison with the number expected from its estimated sfr .",
    "this region consists of several scattered star - forming cores , separated by distances of several parsecs from each other ( m.povich , private communication ; see also busquet et al .",
    "this is consistent with the hierarchical assembly of the cluster in our simulation , since several isolated , intermediate - mass star - forming clumps may produce a relatively numerous combined population of ysos that may however not yet have formed massive stars , because in the ghc scenario this only occurs after these smaller regions have merged to form a massive one .",
    "this is again illustrated in fig.[fig : cum_mass_hist ] , which shows that the relative abundance of massive stars increases over time , especially after groups 1 and 2 have merged .",
    "we conclude that the scenario of ghc provides an assembly mechanism for clusters that naturally predicts the observed age segregation and bottom - heavy imf of young clusters . in a future contribution",
    "we plan to carry out a detailed quantitative comparison between the clusters in simulations that sample the imf to lower masses ( see sec.[sec : limits ] ) and the observed properties of specific clusters .",
    "the present study is based on the underlying hypothesis that our probabilistic stellar particle formation scheme mimics the mechanism leading to the development of the imf .",
    "that is , we interpret the imf strictly as a random sampling process , so that the scarcity of massive stars is interpreted to imply that the probability of forming one is very low and given precisely by the imf .",
    "interestingly , the fact that our simulation , using a probabilistic criterion for the formation of stellar particles ( cf",
    ".  sec .",
    "[ sec : sf ] ) , qualitatively reproduces several observed properties of young clusters , suggests that our underlying assumption is reasonably realistic .",
    "nevertheless , our star formation scheme does have some limitations .",
    "most importantly , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sf ] , the minimmum stellar - particle mass is @xmath106 , which is near the peak of the observed stellar imf , and thus we are missing stars on the low - mass side of the imf .",
    "our imposed imf is thus a strict power law , that lacks the turnover at low masses .",
    "this implies that we are missing a significant number of low - mass stars , about half of the total number of stars .",
    "their mass , @xmath107 of the total mass for a @xcite imf , and @xmath108 for a @xcite imf , is instead deposited into the stars that do form in the simulation , with masses @xmath106 to @xmath109 .",
    "this may affect the dynamics of the clusters formed in the simulation , although not very strongly , since the missing stars have low masses , and are not expected to affect the dynamics of the higher - mass ones too much , especially if the tend to form a roughly uniform background .",
    "the fact that the structure of our clusters resembles that of observed young clusters reinforces this expectation .",
    "we nevertheless plan to improve our star formation scheme in order to produce a more complete stellar - particle mass spectrum , and with this carry out a more detailed and quantitative comparison with observations .",
    "meanwhile , we consider that our study conveys an illustrative first approximation to the problem of cluster assembly , capturing the essential aspects of the hierarchical assembly of these objects .    other limitations of our simulation are that it does not include magnetic fields nor any form of feedback other than ionisation heating , in particular supernova ( sn ) explosions",
    ". the neglect of magnetic fields may not be crucial , since our present understanding is that mcs are generally magnetically supercritical , meaning that the magnetic field is in general unable to support them against their own self - gravity , and therefore they proceed unimpeded to global collapse .",
    "the neglect of sn explosions is also not crucial because of two main reasons .",
    "first , it is becoming increasingly accepted that sn explosions need to occur within the clouds in order to remove significant amounts of mass from the clouds @xcite , although on the other hand , only sne that explode in low - density environments avoid energy losses that allow efficient coupling with the gas @xcite .",
    "also , pre - sn feedback is required to allow blastwaves to propagate efficiently into the ism @xcite .",
    "second , and more importantly , our study suggests that the assembly of the clusters is accomplished mostly during the early stages ( first few myr ) of the clouds evoloution , during which few or no sne are expected to occur , especially if massive stars form late in the evolution of the cloud , as suggested by the ghc scenario .",
    "so , the ionising feedback included in our simulations is probably the most relevant form of feedback for regulating the gas flow onto the sites where the new stars are forming .    finally , our feedback prescription ( sec .",
    "[ sec : feedback ] ) is of course crude , solving the radiative transfer only in an approximate way .",
    "although it was shown in paper i that the evolution of an hii  region with this prescription does track the uniform - medium analytic solution reasonably well , it is possible that our prescription allows evaporation of regions that should be shaded behind dense clumps , since it does not take into account the density of the intervening material between the ionising star and the cell on which the effect of the radiation is being determined .",
    "thus , our simulations may somewhat overestimate the evaporation rate of material in filaments containing dense clumps .",
    "however , since the filaments themselves are denser than the background medium , and their length far exceeds that of isolated clumps and cores , their column density for situations where the filament is aligned with the ionising object and with the intervening clump ( as in the case of filaments feeding the main clump where the ionising object formed ) may be comparable to or even larger than that of the intervening clump . therefore , the shadowing caused by this clump is likely to be of secondary importance . indeed , figure 10 in paper",
    "i shows the gradual evaporation of filaments containing clumps in a way that allows the formation of `` pillars '' , and finally isolated globules within growing hii  regions , similarly to objects like the `` pillars of creation '' and dark globules , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "our feedback prescription allows the simulations to run orders of magnitude faster than if the radiative transfer is followed in full .",
    "we thus conclude that our prescription provides a sufficiently realistic framework for the study of the assembly of stellar clusters .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the mechanism of assembly of a cluster in a numerical simulation of cloud formation and collapse by converging flows . the assembly proceeds in a hierarchical way as a consequence of the hierarchical nature of the collapse of its parent cloud @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical collapse regime consists of small - scale , large - amplitude ( ssla ) collapses ( involving small total masses ) within large - scale , small - amplitude ( lssa ) ones ( involving large masses , which are spread out over large scale regions ) .",
    "collapse at all scales involves accretion onto the troughs of the potential wells ( the collapse `` centers '' ) .",
    "the large - scale collapses involve the generation of filamentary flows that funnel material from the whole large - scale region down to its collapse center , and the small - scale collapsing regions `` ride '' along these large - scale filamentary flows @xcite , in a `` conveyor belt '' fashion @xcite . because the small - scale collapses start forming stars earlier ( due to their larger amplitudes , which imply shorter free - fall times ) , they often reach the large - scale collapse center already containing stars in addition to fresh gas .",
    "this mechanism then implies that massive star - forming sites form by the merging of smaller - scale star - forming regions , which supply both stars and gas to the larger sites , and thus these larger - scale sites contain a mixture of locally formed stars and stars that formed at a remote , smaller - scale site and that are brought to the large - scale site by the infalling flow .",
    "moreover , the stars that form in the small - scale , scattered sites have an infall velocity corresponding to the larger - scale potential well .",
    "however , stars formed in the massive center of the large - scale collapse , form from gas that has probably been shocked upon its arrival there , and so they form with a somewhat lower velocity dispersion .    finally , this scenario also implies that the sfr must increase with time during early stages of evolution , and then decrease again as the massive stars begin to destroy their forming sites @xcite .",
    "this acceleration of the sf process , combined with a face - value interpretation of the imf as a probability distribution function of stellar masses , suggests that massive stars are only expected to form once the sfr is large enough to sample the imf to high masses .",
    "therefore , massive stars should form last in the evolution of the whole ensemble of star - forming sites , once the low - mass ones have merged to form a large - mass , high - sfr one .    from these considerations ,",
    "we have concluded that a cluster that has formed from the hierarchical collapse of its parent cloud must have the following characteristics :    * the oldest stars tend to have low masses , because they formed in the low - mass sites early in the evolution of the cloud .",
    "however , newer stars can be either low - or high mass , as they form in the high - mass site formed by the merger of the low - mass ones .",
    "* the oldest stars tend to have larger velocity dispersions , because they are characterized by the infall velocity of the material onto the high - mass collapse center",
    ". however , this effect tends to be washed out by the stellar interaction as the cluster ages .",
    "* as a consequence , older stars tend to be at larger distances from the collapse center ( or filament ) .",
    "* the most massive stars tend to be younger , because they only form when the sfr of the whole region has increased sufficiently to sample the high - mass regions of the imf . * as a consequence , the low- and intermediate - mass sites that have not concluded the merging process may be defficient in the highest - mass stars . * because of the increasing sfr , most stars are young , although a small fraction may be as old as several myr .",
    "these features are in good qualitative agreement with observed properties of young clusters , which seem to have a hierarchical structure , have an age gradient , so that the oldest stars tend to be farther from the forming sites @xcite and to have larger velocities @xcite .",
    "also , the scenario implies that ensembles of cores in early phases of evolution will be defficient in massive stars compared to the expected number form their combined stellar production , as observed by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the scenario of ghc allows a clear understanding of the properties of young clusters , in terms of the multi - scale collapse of their parent clouds .",
