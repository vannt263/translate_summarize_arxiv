    "electrostatic solitary waves ( esw ) or solitons are common occurrences in the near - earth plasmas and are routinely observed in the boundary layers and turbulent regions of the magnetosphere @xcite . in recent years , many authors have tried to model these esws with the help of different physical models @xcite .",
    "most of the observational and theoretical studies have indicated that these esws are basically potential structures ( compressive and rarefactive ) with density structures ( enhancement and compression ) and weak double layers @xcite .",
    "solitons or double layers are plasma sheaths ( discontinuities ) moving in a plasma , which require competing species of charged particles with different masses ( inertia ) and charges . in an electron - ion plasma",
    ", these requirements are fulfilled due to colder ions with their large inertia , which helps in formation of plasma sheaths .",
    "so , an electron sheath in a plasma can be effectively modified by equally hot ions @xcite .",
    "however , majority of these theoretical analyses do not consider the effect of magnetic field into account",
    ". a full - blown analysis of solitary waves where magnetic perturbation is self - consistently considered can be very rigorous @xcite .",
    "several space - borne experiments have observed esws moving parallel to the ambient magnetic field in various near - earth plasma environments such as the solar wind , magnetosheath and magnetotail regions , and auroral zone @xcite .",
    "these esws are , in general , bipolar structures moving in the direction of the background magnetic field @xcite . in the auroral region , these esws are reported as negative potential structures travelling upward along the auroral magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "these observations are also supported by those from the freja satellite data @xcite . besides ,",
    "space plasmas , in general , can be largely modeled with maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "however , advancement of satellite based technologies in recent years , has led to the realization that most of these plasmas , especially the near - earth plasmas , have high energy tails and heat - flux shoulders , which may be attributed to the fact that these plasmas are quite inhomogeneous and semi - collisionless @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it has been established that these plasmas are best modeled by a generalized lorentzian or kappa distribution ( especially the electron distributions ) rather than by a pure maxwellian @xcite .",
    "experimental observations on solar wind plasmas , in recent years , have established that these plasmas have a spectral index @xcite @xmath0 . in the earth s magnetosphere , the spectral index is typically observed @xcite in the range @xmath1 .",
    "we , in this chapter , consider these esws in the presence of a super thermal electron component .",
    "we , in this work have considered formation of ion - acoustic electrostatic solitary waves in the presence of a background magnetic field .",
    "we also consider the electron polulation to be super - thermal , modeled through a lorentzian or kappa velocity distribution .",
    "we further consider the effect of two species of electrons with different temperatures .",
    "presence of multi - temperature electrons in magnetosphere is reported experimentally @xcite .",
    "in section i , we present the plasma model that we have considered for formation of these esws in a warm magnetoplasma . in section",
    "ii , we consider the solitary wave solutions of the model , where we have incorporated the effect of super - thermal electrons . in section iii ,",
    "we consider two independent components of super - thermal electrons with two different temperatures .",
    "we however have shown that the two - temperature electrons have only marginal effect on the structure and parameter regimes of the esws .",
    "finally , we summarise our conclusions in section iv .",
    "the parameter regime considered in this work and the related results can be relevant in explaining large - amplitude esws observed in the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "below we write down the basic governing equations for a thermal plasma , which is immersed in an external magnetic field @xmath2 ,    @xmath3    where eqs.([eq : continuity ] ) and ( [ eq : momentum ] ) represent the continuity equation and conservation of momentum for the ions .",
    "the function @xmath4 represents equilibrium electron ( and ion ) density according to the particular velocity distribution function ( vdf ) i.e. boltzmanian or kappa distribution .",
    "the last equation is the equation of state . in the above equations , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the ion and electron densities and",
    "@xmath7 is the ion gyro - frequency .",
    "other symbols have their usual meanings and quasi - neutrality is assumed all throughout .",
    "we assume the external magnetic field to be in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "we assume an arbitrary electrostatic perturbation in time and space and define a co - moving coordinate @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are direction cosines and thus defined by the relation @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the velocity of the nonlinear wave . far away from the perturbation we assume everything to be stationary and define the boundary condition as at @xmath13 and @xmath14 . without any loss of generality , we can assume that the physical quantities are constant along @xmath15 direction .",
    "we now describe a general procedure for reducing eqs.([eq : continuity]-[eq : state ] ) . from the continuity equation ,",

    "note that all throughout the calculations , temperature @xmath28 is expressed in energy units .",
    "we now take a derivative of eqs.([eq : eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) with respect to @xmath21 to get the following relations , @xmath29+v_{x}\\frac{n}{n_{0}}\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{v_{m}},\\label{eq : eq6}\\\\ -v_{m}\\frac{n_{0}}{n}\\left(v_{z}''-\\frac{n'}{n}v_{z}'\\right ) & = & -l_{z}[f'(n)+g'(n)],\\label{eq : eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have substituted for @xmath30 from eq.([eq : eq2 ] ) . by differentiating eq.([eq : eq1 ] ) , successively with respect to @xmath21 , we get , @xmath31 using eqs.([eq : eq6]-[eq : eq8 ] ) , we get , @xmath32=-[f'(n)+g'(n)]+\\omega^{2}\\left(\\frac{n}{n_{0}}-1\\right)-l_{z}v_{z}\\frac{n}{n_{0}}\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{v_{m}},\\label{eq : eq10}\\ ] ] where we have used the condition @xmath11 and substituted for @xmath33 from eq.([eq : eq1 ] ) .",

    "consider now various bi - polar electrostatic structures observed in different regions viz .",
    "auroral region of the ionosphere and earth s magnetosphere .",
    "these structures show peak - to - peak variation of electric field ranging from few hundreds of micro volts per meter to milli volts per meter within an interval of micro seconds to milli seconds .",

    "those observed in the magnetosheath region are of much smaller amplitudes ( micro volts per meter ) with a very short duration ( micro seconds ) @xcite .",
    "note that the bi - polar structures represented in fig.[fig : soliton - arb - kappa](b ) are in the rest frame of the solitons , which can be transformed to the duration of the pulses in the rest frame of the detector ( on board the satellite ) . in fig.[fig : bi - polar - electrostatic - pulse ] , we show various bi - polar electrostatic structures for these parameters in real - time units . in all panels of fig.[fig : bi - polar - electrostatic - pulse ] , the pulse is of shorter duration and larger height for highly lorentzian electrons than maxwellian electrons .",
    "the peak - to - peak electric field variation due to lorentzian electrons in panel ( d ) is @xmath95 with a duration @xmath96 , which is typical in these regions @xcite .",
    "for the same parameters , the peak - to - peak variation is much smaller @xmath97 with a longer duration @xmath98 for maxwellian electrons .",
    "the pulses due to maxwellian electrons are comparable to lorentzian electrons in both pulse height and width only when the pulses become very large , which are however , not observed in these regions of space plasma .",
    "so , we conclude that the deviation of electron temperature from thermal behavior is an essential factor , which needs to be taken into account in order to explain the relatively small - amplitude and steep ( smaller width ) bi - polar electrostatic structures in the auroral regions .",
    "we further note that the effect due to super - thermal electrons is more pronounced when @xmath99 or @xmath100 , where @xmath101 defines the angle between the ambient magnetic field and the direction of propation of the soliton .",

    "we consider two species of electrons  hot and cold one .",
    "we still assume that both species of electrons are lorentzian , which gives us freedom to investigate the situation both for thermal and super - thermal cases .",
    "all mathematical analyses remaining same , differing only in the expression denoting the combined density of the electrons [ see eq.([eq : density ] ) ] , @xmath103 and the quasi - neutrality condition [ see eq.([eq : boltzmann ] ) ] ,    bi - polar electrostatic pulse in real - time units .",

    "the primary drawback in this formalism that we can not find an equivalent sagdeev potential for solitons of arbitrary amplitudes as eq.([eq : two - density ] ) can not be inverted to find a unique analytical expression for the potential @xmath42 in terms of the densities . in what follows",
    ", we shall expand eq.([eq : two - density ] ) around @xmath109 , assuming the analysis for only small - amplitude solitons , so that we can find out the sagdeev potential which , however , _ will be valid _ only in the limit of small amplitude .",

    "the temperature ratio of the cold and hot electrons is @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "proceeding as before , we can reduce the equations to the form given by eq.([eq : sagdeev ] ) and write the sagdeev potential ( for small amplitude , @xmath115 ) as @xmath116}{200v_{m}^{2}(f_{1}\\sigma n^{8/3}-f_{1}v_{m}^{2}+f_{2}n^{3})},\\label{eq : small - sagdeev}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 and other quantities are given by , @xmath118 the quantities @xmath119 as @xmath115 and it is easy to see that the function @xmath120 satisfies all the requirements of sagdeev potential .",
