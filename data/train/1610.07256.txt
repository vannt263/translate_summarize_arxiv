    "most of the existing schemes for twr systems assume known csi ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) . due to many reasons , such as the large overhead of channel estimation process or relatively rapid variations of the channel , perfect csi is not always available .",
    "in such scenarios , using non - coherent modulation schemes such as differential phase shift keying ( dpsk ) that require no csi knowledge is a practical solution . while there have been significant research efforts on using differential modulation ( dm ) for twr systems , most , e.g. @xcite , assume symbol - level synchronization among all nodes . in practice",
    ", many reasons such as different propagation delays or different dispersive channels , lead to a timing misalignment between the arriving signals .",
    "therefore , having a perfectly synchronized twr system is very difficult which , in return , renders the design of differentially modulated schemes more challenging . in the case of synchronous twr systems ,",
    "many schemes were proposed to address the absence of csi , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , little work has been conducted to tackle asynchronous communication scenarios .",
    "one scenario of particular interest is the use of asynchronous mr - twr systems in which timing errors not only occur at users but at relays as well .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a dm scheme along with maximum likelihood ( ml ) detection and several suboptimal solutions for a number of relaying strategies when csi is not available at any node .",
    "the authors further extend their results to the multi - antenna case based on differential unitary space - time modulation . a simple amplify - and - forward ( af ) scheme is proposed in @xcite based on dm in which the self - interference term is estimated and removed prior to detection . the resulting bit error rate ( ber ) and the optimum power allocation strategies are also studied . in @xcite , the authors propose a joint relay selection and af scheme using dm .",
    "the scheme selects the relay that minimizes the maximum ber of the two sources .",
    "@xcite proposes a dm scheme that uses @xmath1 parallel relays , for which a denoising function is derived to detect the sign change of the network coded symbol at each relay which is used later by the users for detection .",
    "the paper obtains a closed form expression for the ber for the single - relay case along with deriving a sub - optimal power allocation scheme .",
    "furthermore , the authors derive lower and upper bounds on the ber for the multi - relay case .",
    "a low complexity dpsk - based scheme is proposed in @xcite for physical - layer network coding to acquire the network coded symbol at the relay without requiring csi knowledge .",
    "compared to the schemes in @xcite which require more complexity , this scheme shows better performance at high snrs .",
    "however , the detector is only derived for a binary alphabet .    a few proposals in the literature considered the design of distributed space time coding ( dstc ) coupled with differential modulation for synchronous twr systems , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the models in @xcite assume two - phase transmission and the lack of a direct link between the two users .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite assumes a three - phase transmission and that a direct link between the two users exist .",
    "all the solutions discussed above have strict synchronization requirements for proper operation .",
    "only few works considered asynchronous twr systems where dm is used to mitigate csi absence . for instance , @xcite proposes an interference cancellation scheme to reduce the interference from neighboring symbols caused by imperfect synchronization .",
    "@xcite extends the scheme in @xcite to dual - relay twr systems .",
    "while @xcite present important results , they are restricted to flat fading channels , and the delays that can be tolerated are only within the period of a symbol , which make them suitable neither for time - dispersive channels nor for systems experiencing large relative propagation delays . in this paper",
    ", we consider a more general frequency - selective fading channel and propose two schemes that can tolerate larger relative propagation delays compared to @xcite .",
    "specifically , we first propose the joint blind - differential ( jbd ) detection scheme in which we first perform blind channel estimation to be able to remove the self - interference component , and then perform differential detection .",
    "we provide an approximate closed form expression for the ber for large snr values .",
    "we then propose a scheme that is based on differential dstc , referred to as jbd - dstc , to fully harness the available diversity in the system .",
    "the jbd - dstc scheme significantly reforms the jbd scheme in order to obtain an stc structure for the partner s message at each user .",
    "the pairwise error probability of this scheme along with the achievable diversity is also discussed .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "this paper proposed two schemes for differential asynchronous mr - twr systems in frequency - selective fading channels in which neither the knowledge of the csi nor the propagation delays is required .",
    "an advantage of these schemes is that the relays are only required to perform simple operations on the received ( overlapped ) signals , e.g. , complex conjugation and time - reversal .",
    "also , after estimating the channel - dependent parameters , only a simple symbol - wise detection rule is required . through numerical simulations , it is observed that the proposed schemes are superior to the existing ones in the literature .",
    "the paper has also provided analytical error probability results for the proposed schemes that matched the results of monte carlo simulations .",

    "when the channel is time - varying within the same ofdm block , neither @xmath51 will be circulant nor will @xmath278 be diagonal , which means that the subcarrier orthogonality is lost , giving rise to ici .",
    "it is clear to see that due to the different time delays experienced by the components of the signal in , different circular shifts resulted . since having a delay of @xmath279 samples in the time domain causes the @xmath39 subcarrier to have a phase shift of @xmath280 , @xmath281 , we can write the received signal on the @xmath39 subcarrier as @xmath282_{k , k }    \\left [ h_{df , ir}^{(m)}\\right]_{k , k}^ * e^{-j\\frac { 2\\pi \\left ( k-1 \\right ) \\left ( d_{rb}-d_{ir } \\right)}{n } }   { { s}_{i , k}^{(m)}}^ * + { v}_{b , k}^{(m)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since we assumed the channels to be reciprocal , then for all @xmath15 , @xmath49 , @xmath283 .",
