    "adding a weak external potential ( e.g. electric field giving rise additional potential energy @xmath109 at site @xmath7 ) changes the equilibrium concentrations and hence the corresponding equation to @xmath110 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath111 can indeed be interpreted as activities , since @xmath112 have a form of chemical potentials on the sites .",
    "the master equation can be interpreted as a combination of the local continuity equation @xmath113 and the local linear response equation @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "close to equilibrium and for very small potentials @xmath116 the values of @xmath117 are close to unity , so that the deviations of chemical potentials from their equilibrium values of zero are small . therefore ,",
    "close to equilibrium , @xmath118 and @xmath119 the external potential @xmath109 is set to zero in the main text .",
    "it is interesting to note that not the chemical potentials but the activities at the sites are reinterpreted as electric potentials , which leads to differences in the behavior of the random resistor - capacitor model and the random potential model far from equilibrium , i.e. for large concentration gradients .",
    "in a stationary situation corresponding to quasiequilibrium we have @xmath120 where the sum runs over the nearest neighbors of the site @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , in the thermodynamical limit @xmath40 the permeability of the membrane tends to zero , and all local currents in it as well : @xmath121    now we show that in quasi - equilibrium the local concentrations and the local activities ( `` potentials '' ) tend to be independent from each other ( although the local transition rates are correlated with the boltzmann factors and thus local concentrations ) . to see this we note that according to eq.([means ] ) the activity ( potential ) at a site @xmath3 is the weighted arithmetic mean of the activities of the neighbors it is connected to , and eq.([curr ] )",
    "states that the difference between the activities of the connected sites under quasi - equilibrium tends arbitrarily small .",
    "therefore our system can be considered as composed of large , practically equipotential regions whose potential hardly fluctuates around its mean @xmath122 depending on the region s position . in these regions the concentrations @xmath123 can be averaged over the physically small volume still containing the large number of sites , so that @xmath124 .",
    "we note that this last property does not rely on homogenization or on the isotropy and will hold even if our system is built of independent parallel or interwoven wires !",
    "let us now assume that at large scales the corresponding electric system homogenizes . in this case the total voltage profile ( which in our case is mapped on the profile of activities ) obtained by the coarse graining ( moving average ) of the voltages ( activities ) over macroscopic domains of the system which are large enough compared to the lattice spacing but small compared to @xmath31 follows a linear behavior ( similar to those of the effective concentration in fig.1 ) .",
    "then the coarse - grained activity is a linear function of the coordinate , and thus also the coarse grained concentration is linear in coordinate , with the proportionality factor @xmath125 between the both .",

    "<S> we first recapitulate the following properties of percolation systems : ( i ) the mixture of resistors with given finite conductivity ( at concentration @xmath68 ) with insulating bonds ( of zero conductivity ) at concentration @xmath70 possesses zero conductance below the percolation threshold @xmath77 and finite conductance above it . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding system homogenizes at scales above the correlation length @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this homogenization also takes place for arbitrary distribution of the conductivities of the resistors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , ( ii ) the mixture of resistors with given finite conductivity ( at concentration @xmath68 ) with superconducting bonds ( at concentration @xmath70 ) possesses finite conductance below the percolation threshold @xmath78 for superconducting bonds , with @xmath79 , and infinite conductance above it . </S>",
    "<S> these properties do hold not only for the bernoulli percolation model but also in the case when the short - range correlations in the occupation probabilities of the bond by the corresponding resistors / insulators / superconductors are present . </S>",
    "<S> this statement is a ( silently assumed ) basis of all renormalization group approaches in percolation .    using the results of the theory of electric circuits , </S>",
    "<S> see e.g. @xcite , we show that the total conductivity of a resistor network is a non - decaying function of the conductivity of each particular bond . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the system as placed between two `` superconducting '' bars considered as a terminal 1 of the system . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the poles @xmath3 and @xmath7 between which @xmath17 is switched as terminal 2 . </S>",
    "<S> using the theory of two - terminal circuits we calculate the input impedance ( total conductivity ) @xmath80 as a function @xmath17 : @xmath81 , where @xmath82 are the elements of the impedance matrix of the system . for a system of reciprocal passive elements ( no batteries , no diodes ) </S>",
    "<S> this matrix is non - negatively definite and symmetric as a consequence of non - negative heat production and of reciprocity theorem . in the case of pure resistor network </S>",
    "<S> the matrix is real . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , so that @xmath80 is a non - decaying function of @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we show that the numerator never diverges . </S>",
    "<S> we fix some @xmath85 and declare the fraction @xmath58 of bonds ( starting from the ones with largest @xmath86 ) to be superconductive . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest conductivity of a changed bond is @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting bonds are non - percolating by construction , and the conductance of the remaining system is finite , being smaller than a conductance of the resistor - superconductor mixture where all conductivities are put to @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the numerator can only diverge if @xmath88 , i.e. never in finite dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerator does not vanish for a system with percolation concentration @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> let us remove a portion @xmath90 of bonds with smallest @xmath86 without destroying percolation and denote the largest removed conductivity by @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the system percolates and has a conductance which is larger then the conductance of a two - phase system constructed of resistors with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which is nonzero since we are above percolation threshold . </S>",
    "<S> thus the numerator can only vanish if @xmath94 , and no bonds can be removed .    the denominator in eq.([maineq ] ) can diverge if the corresponding mean value of the boltzmann factor diverges . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath95 is proportional to the sojourn time at a site @xmath3 in equilibrium , this corresponds to diverging mean sojourn time at a site , i.e. to a trap model , which in high dimensions is equivalent to ctrw with a broad distribution of waiting times .    </S>",
    "<S> the denominator can not vanish . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath96 be the probability density of @xmath0 , and @xmath97 its median , @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath99 where the integrand is non - negative , we have @xmath100 since @xmath101 is monotonically decaying .    summarizing our findings we state that there exists an exact correspondence between the effective diffusion coefficient in a random potential and macroscopic conductivity in a random resistor model . </S>",
    "<S> this simple relation allows us to obtain exact bounds on the effective diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> it also allows for elucidating possible sources of anomalous diffusion in such model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the subdiffusion is possible either if the mean boltzmann factor of the corresponding potential diverges ( energetic disorder ) or if the percolation concentration in a system is equal to unity , i.e. if the system is already at the percolation threshold , in one dimension , or on finitely ramified fractals ( structural disorder ) , and that superdiffusion is impossible in our system under any condition .    * </S>",
