    "several fields of quasar astronomy are still on uncertain grounds . although a basic understanding in terms of accretion on a supermassive black hole seems now established ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , there are several aspects of quasars that still defy comprehension or at least a consistent view .",
    "even if we learned many important things on quasars in the past fifty years , we have to acknowledge that mechanisms giving rise to continuum emission in several bands of the electromagnetic spectrum are still poorly understood , as recently stressed by several authors @xcite . specifically , it is not clear how soft x - ray emission originates , and why radio emission is strong in a minority of quasar and faint in the wide majority .",
    "and we do not know",
    "well how quasars evolve since there is no major sign of evolution from redshift almost 0 to ( at least ) 4 , when the universe was about @xmath1  of its current age .",
    "a maze of apparently confusing pieces of evidence still fogs the connection between evolution and unification schemes . not to mention the processes that give rise to prominent line emission . going beyond heuristic considerations based on the nebular physics developed to interpret  regions and planetary nebul  in the 1950s and 1960s",
    "has proved a daunting challenge .",
    "the complexity of quasar emitting regions , dense gas exposed to an incredibly strong radiation field became clear relatively early after quasar discovery @xcite .",
    "so it is perhaps not surprising if some basic and important issues have been left in a limbo , without a clear understanding ever being reached , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "one of the issues concerns the emission mechanism of low - ionization lines in quasars .",
    "if we start looking at quasars from their optical and uv spectra , one of their notable properties is the coexistence of low and high emission lines , where for low and high ionization we understand lines emitted by ionic species whose ionization potential is @xmath2 ev ( hydrogen , singly ionized ionic species of magnesium , carbon , iron , calcium ) , and @xmath3 ev ( triply ionized carbon , helium , four times ionised nitrogen ) respectively .",
    "there is now convincing evidence that high ionization and hydrogen lines are mainly photoionized by the strong quasar continuum since emission line luminosity is proportional to continuum luminosity ( at least to a first approximation , @xcite ) and lines respond to continuum luminosity changes @xcite .",
    "the issue is still not solved at the time of writing for , whose emission features extend from the far uv to the near ir and are in some cases dominating the appearance of optical quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "the 4d eigenvector 1 ( 4de1 ) is a parameter space best suited to understand the phenomenology of the of the broad line region ( blr ) , nowadays an `` umbrella term '' that embraces an unresolved but complex region where all broad lines are emitted @xcite . following the 4de1 scheme ,",
    "sources can be divided in two populations , a and b , with separation at fwhm(h@xmath4 ) = 4000 km s@xmath5 .",
    "several differences are found between sources above and below this limits ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "population a shows : ( 1 ) a scarcity of rl sources , ( 2 ) strong / moderate  emission , ( 3 ) a soft x - ray excess , ( 4 ) high - ionization broad lines showing blueshift / asymmetry and ( 5 ) broad line profiles are best described by lorentz fits .",
    "meanwhile , population b : ( 1 ) includes the large majority of the rl sources , ( 2 ) shows weak / moderate  emission , ( 3 ) does not show a soft x - ray excess nor a prominent high ionization line ( hil ) blueshift / asymmetry , and ( 4 ) their  profiles are best fit with double gaussian models .",
    "considering that the eigenvector 1 identifies a single dimension in a multidimensional space , it is appropriate to talk of a `` sequence along the eigenvector 1 '' ( see for example fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the equivalent width of hils is anti - correlated with  equivalent width @xcite , suggesting a systematic decrease in ionization level from population b to population a @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are systematic eddington ratio differences along the sequence , with pop .",
    "a sources being higher radiators .",
    "the blue ward asymmetry observed in the  profile indicates that at least a part of the hils is emitted in outflowing gas where the receding part of the flow is obscured @xcite .",
    "the prominence of the outflow is maximised at the high eddington ratio end of the 4de1 sequence @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , there are trends that are preserved along the 4de1 sequence . for example ,  and  show systematically narrower profiles than  @xcite .",

    "emission is strong .",
    "the accretion disk obscures the receding half of the emitting clouds , allowing us to see only the approaching side . when the line of sight forms an angle with respect to the disk axis , we expect to have symmetric   profiles and less    emission .",
    "the  core shares the same behavior as .",
    "it is unshifted , symmetric , and is consistent with a flattened or nearly spherical distribution of clouds .    summing up",
    ", the location of a source in the 4de1 sequence appears to be governed by eddington ratio with orientation acting as a source of scatter @xcite .",
    "black hole mass and , to a lower extent , metallicity are also found to have a broadening effect on the 4de1 sequence @xcite . even if 4de1 eases the systematization of quasar spectral properties , a full understanding of some parameters used in the formulation of the 4de1 itself is still missing .    photons . ]",
    "photoionization models have troubles in explaining the intensities of some prominent low - ionization lines ( lils ) : the wording ``   problem '' has been widely used to address the issue of the impossibility to reproduce the strength of  ( optical and uv ) with simple photoionization models @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the energy level structure of the  ion and the uncertainties in the atomic data make theoretical models calculations very difficult @xcite .",
    "it was recognised in the late 1970s that an important  albeit insufficient ",
    "mechanism for producing optical  emission is collisional excitation @xcite . over the years , the importance of continuum and line fluorescence ( especially  and  lines self fluorescence ) has been also recognized @xcite for explaining the whole   emission from uv to ir .",
    "however , the large number of electronic transitions of the singly ionized iron ion form a pseudo - continuum especially prominent in the uv range between 2000 and 4000  . as stressed since long @xcite ,  can be the single largest contributor to the emission line spectra , and is therefore a major cooling agent in the blr .",
    "the effect of cooling is to lower excitation temperature and hence to saturate  emission with increasing iron abundance @xcite .",
    "photoionization models fail to account for strong  emitters with @xmath6 1 , where  in the intensity ratio between the  blend at 4570   and .",
    "it is still unclear whether models are inadequate , or an independent heating source is needed . at any rate , the problems of photoionization models led to the suggestion that  is emitted in a region which is not radiatively heated , arguably of high density ( @xmath710@xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath10 ) , high column density (  @xmath7 10@xmath11 @xmath12 ) , and relatively low electron temperature , t @xmath7 8000 k  @xcite .",
    "a possible scenario involves a shocked region shielded from the central continuum source @xcite .",
    "the locus of the emission of all lils in the blr is subject of debate since many years .",
    "as far as spatial location of  emission is concerned , circumstantial evidence indicated the outer part of the blr @xcite or the outer part of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "recent efforts were successful in estimating the reverberation distance of  in two low-@xmath13 sources with  of moderate intensity @xcite , indicating a time - delay distance @xmath0 1.5 times larger than the one of , as found for mgii@xmath142800 @xcite .",

    "it has been suggested that these lines are emitted under the same physical conditions as the  lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out a landmark observational study of the  line for thirteen seyfert 1 galaxies , showing that the strength and width of these lines are very similar to the h@xmath15 line .",
    "he suggested that the emission is associated to the blr due to the lack of a narrow component .",
    "@xcite proposed bowen fluorescence ( or ly@xmath4 fluorescence ) as the main excitation process for .",

    "therefore , bowen fluorescence is not the only excitation process for  although it accounts for most or at least half of the photon flux in the wide majority of the sources studied by @xcite .",

    "the ionization potential of ca@xmath23  is 11.871 ev , so the gas where the ir triplet is emitted should be strongly shielded from incident ionization at wavelengths shortward of ly@xmath15 ( @xmath010.20 ev ) .",
    "we expect that this region is neutral , optically thick and with high column density @xcite .",
    "due to the similarity between the energy of ly@xmath15 and the ionization potential of ca@xmath23 , the 3d metastable level is highly populated and the collisional excitation process leading to the  ir triplet emission is efficient . attempting to reproduce",
    "the gas conditions requires that processes like free - free heating , photoionization from excited levels , bound - free heating and compton recoil ionization be included in photoionization calculations .",
    "these processes are able to heat neutral gas with great depths @xcite and produce low ionization lines without the need to call upon nonradiative heating processes .    the first survey of  near - ir triplet in luminous seyfert 1 galaxies and low-@xmath13  quasars was performed by @xcite .",
    "he could clearly detect the  emission in fourteen objects , and he could also test that the three lines of the calcium triplet emerge from an optically thick region since they show the same intensity within the uncertainties .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that the field velocities of  and  are closely related , with  being somewhat narrower . on other hand , @xcite did not find differences in widths , suggesting that  and   are emitted at the same distance from the ionizing source .    comparing pa@xmath4 @xmath1412818 , oi @xmath1411287 , @xmath1411127 and  triplet",

    "this is likely due to a difference in distance from the central continuum source of the quasar .",
    "a natural site of emission is the accretion disk that offers the high column density required for emitting lils @xcite .",

    "@xcite and @xcite proposed that there may be a nonradiative source of heating which can be the dissipation of mechanical heating inside the accretion disk .",
    "we want to point out that although the emitting regions may be at the same distance , they do not have to be the same physical region .",
    "for example , we may envision a configuration of plane parallel distribution of blr clouds above and below the accretion disk . in this configuration",
    "the clouds dynamics is dominated by gravity and thus the emitting gas is virialized .",
    "some of these clouds might be at the same distance from the ionization source as some regions within the accretion disk .",
    "and thus they share the same dynamics .",
    "however , they do not necessarily share the same physical conditions . on the other hand , the presence of non gravitational forces such as radiation pressure",
    "is not excluded @xcite .",
    "as we explain below , the emitting gas within the blr may be subject to different dynamics .",

    "is needed .",
    "the strongest  emitters show however no solution of continuity with fainter  emitters in the 4de1 sequence . by occam",

    "what happens to these lines along the 4de1 sequence ?",

    "there are several difficulties to face before a full answer can be obtained .",
    "an important side of the issue is observational :  and  are shifted in the near ir even if redshift is just @xmath26 .",
    "obtaining near ir spectra with the same quality ( s / n and dispersion ) of optical ones has become possible only in recent times , and there is currently a very limited number of observatories where these lines can be observed in quasars .",
    "the consequence is that there are almost no data available even for luminous , low- and intermediate redshift quasars that make most of the samples over which the eigenvector correlations are analysed .",
    "the very spectral range around @xmath27 m in rest frame is not well understood .",
    "the continuum shape is uncertain , since at @xmath27 m the low energy end of the continuum emitted by the accretion disk , and the high energy end of the hot dust dominating in the mid and far ir merge creating a `` hollow '' in the spectral energy distribution @xcite . in addition , the stellar population of the underlying galaxy bulge is expected to emit a spectrum peaking at @xmath28 m , with  in absorption .",
    "turning to the emission lines , significant   has been revealed in the range 8000  10000   @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the main mechanism responsible for the near ir  emission is fluorescence excitation by ly@xmath15 and in a minimal proportion collisional excitation since the lines at 8900  9300   are emitted by cascading from a high excitation level that can be populated only by  fluorescence .",
    "the intensity of these lines are predicted by photoionization calculations and it is possible to model them in the observed spectrum using a template developed _",
    "ad hoc _ @xcite . the last additional complication in that the  and  and high order paschen lines lines are blended together .",

    "this has profound implications .",
    "[ fig : nhu ] shows the behavior of predicted /pa9 and /pa9 intensity ratios as a function of hydrogen density  and ionization parameter @xmath25 .",
