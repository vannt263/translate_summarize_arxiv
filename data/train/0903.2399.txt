    "recently a quantum field theory for the so - called symplectic fermions in @xmath0 dimensions was presented @xcite , in which the kinetic terms were second order in derivatives so that the free theory was of klein - gordon form rather than the usual dirac lagrangian .",
    "this theory was developed within the context of high - temperature superconductivity , the main attractive features being that it permitted a renormalizable four - fermion interaction and had a spontaneously broken sp(4 ) @xmath2 so(5 ) internal symmetry .",
    "this produced both antiferromagnetic and superconducting order parameters lying in the vector representation of a broken so(5 ) symmetry as proposed by zhang @xcite .",
    "however , this theory was manifestly non - relativistic in the sense that the fermion fields were defined as lorentz scalars and spin identified as a flavor .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the corresponding @xmath0 dimensional , poincar invariant , quantum field theory for symplectic fermions , which properly transform under the fundamental dirac representation of the lorentz group . in doing so ,",
    "we show that fermionic spin - half fields may be canonically quantized in a free theory with a _ klein - gordon _",
    "lagrangian , contrary to the common belief that this is only possible for a lagrangian of the dirac type . that this could be possible without violation of the spin - statistics theorem",
    "was considered long ago by pauli @xcite , and we show in this paper , by finding an explicit form for the fields , that this free theory indeed has all the required properties of a consistent free quantum field theory . in particular , we show : causality is preserved ; the fock space hamiltonian and physical momentum take the usual form , the former being both hermitian and positive definite ; the spin - statistics theorem is satisfied ; and the theory has separate @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 symmetries . unlike in the @xmath0 dirac theory , the latter property holds for non - zero mass terms . as such",
    ", it appears that there exists a class of fermionic lagrangians with klein - gordon kinetic terms that are yet to be explored in the literature .",
    "although specialized to @xmath0 dimensions in this paper , our derivation for the free theory may also be generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tft ] we present the canonically quantized free theory , with details of the novel spinor structure provided in an appendix .",
    "symmetries of the free theory and conserved charges are discussed , together with pseudo - hermitian properties of the theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ait ] we then present an example of a pseudo - hermitan and a hermitian renormalizable interacting theory involving symplectic fermions .",
    "we examine the global and discrete symmetries of the latter theory and show it has separate parity and time - reversal violation .",
    "its feynman rules are briefly discussed , and the example of electron - electron scattering is briefly considered .",
    "let @xmath6 denote a transformation under the vector representation of the @xmath0 dimensional lorentz group , so(2,1 ) , and let @xmath7 denote the corresponding element of its fundamental dirac representation .",
    "in order to construct a lorentz invariant quantum field theory for fermions in this representation , we consider a fermionic field @xmath8 and an adjoint field @xmath9 with lorentz transformation @xmath10 since @xmath7 does not act on the lorentz vector indices , the klein - gordon lagrangian @xmath11 is manifestly lorentz invariant and is therefore a candidate lagrangian for a relativistic free theory of fermions .",
    "the corresponding action is of course translation invariant , so such a theory has poincar symmetry .",
    "the equation of motion arising from @xmath12 is a klein - gordon equation of the usual form @xmath13 and the canonical momentum fields corresponding to @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively @xmath14 and @xmath15 , so that the canonical equal - time anticommutation relations for a free quantum theory described by @xmath12 must be @xmath16 with all other equal - time anticommutators zero . in order to canonically quantize this theory ,",
    "we must find fields that satisfy both the equation of motion and the anticommutation relations ( [ eqn : etarf ] ) .",

    ".    one may show ( see app .",
    "[ app : ss ] ) that @xmath26 is a well - defined adjoint in the sense that the inner product @xmath29 is positive definite and lorentz invariant .",
    "in particular , the spinor and adjoint spinor lorentz transform as @xmath30 the inner product is in fact simply @xmath31 and one also finds the trivial completeness relations @xmath32 using the completeness relations ( [ eqn : scr ] ) , we may calculate easily the free - field feynman prescription propagator , with the result that @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the usual fermionic time ordering operator , @xmath35 is the 2@xmath362 identity , and the integral over @xmath37 has feynman boundary conditions .",

    "( [ eqn : cq ] ) ensures that the sign in front of the @xmath42 term is as would be expected in the dirac theory .",

    "( [ eqn : sr2 ] ) .",
    "however this notation is obviously less compact .      the canonical hamiltonian density @xmath43 .",
    "applying the normalization relations ( [ eqn : snr ] ) and the dispersion relation @xmath18 , one finds that the free theory hamiltonian is simply @xmath44 up to an infinite additive constant . here",
    "the cross terms @xmath45 or @xmath46 cancel via the dispersion relation , just as in the scalar klein - gordon theory .",
    "this hamiltonian is clearly hermitian and has a positive definite energy spectrum .",

    "equation ( [ eqn : daf ] ) implies that @xmath9 is not just an _ ad hoc _",
    "field satisfying eqs .",

    "[ app : ss ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the differential operator and mass in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : daf ] ) do not play a canonical rle in the lagrangian itself , but are instead just an effective means of bookkeeping the various minus signs in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : afdn ] ) : @xmath9 remains the canonical adjoint field to @xmath8 .",
    "let us now extend eq .",
    "( [ eqn : daf ] ) and henceforth use it to define a generalized adjoint field @xmath9 for any arbitrary field @xmath8 . in the case",
    "that @xmath8 satisfies the free theory equation of motion - i.e. it is a free field - @xmath9 then reduces to the adjoint free field ( [ eqn : cq ] ) presented above .",
    "further , under this new definition , @xmath9 manifestly transforms under ( global ) lorentz transformations according eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tff ] ) , because @xmath64 is a tensor of the spin indices ( see app . [ app : ss ] and eq .",
    "( [ eqn : astl ] ) ) . as such , in terms of the free theory and lorentz invariance the adjoint field @xmath9 is well - defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : daf ] ) .",
    "importantly , the field product @xmath65 is now hermitian by construction in the same sense that the kinetic term of the dirac lagrangian is hermitian : they are both hermitian up to a total derivative .",

    "it immediately follows from this result that for any field @xmath8 and an adjoint defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : daf ] ) , the kinetic and mass terms in the action @xmath68 or the hamiltonian @xmath69 are independently hermitian , as is any term of the form @xmath70 for an operator @xmath71 that commutes with @xmath72 . in eq . ( [ eqn : hft ] ) we explicitly verified that @xmath69 was hermitian and positive definite when expanded in terms of the free field creation and annihilation operators .",
    "it is now clear that hermiticity of the free theory action and @xmath69 may be guaranteed by construction , whether or not the free theory equation of motion is satisfied .",
    "this implies that we may in principle construct interacting theories with real spectra .",
    "let us consider the global continuous symmetries of the free theory @xmath12 .",
    "first , it is clear that the free theory has a u(1 ) symmetry @xmath73 . applying the fermi statistics @xmath74 , the conserved charge for this symmetry is @xmath75 expanding in terms of creation and annihilation operators via eqs .",

    "@xmath77 is the usual fermion number , such that @xmath78 for particles ( created by @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 for antiparticles ( created by @xmath81 ) .",
    "the free theory also has a global lorentz symmetry so(2,1 ) and poincar symmetry by construction .",
    "in particular , it remains for us to check explicitly that the single ( anti)particle states @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) are spin - half states . in @xmath0 dimensions the angular momentum operator , @xmath84 ,",
    "is the conserved charge corresponding to the symmetry generated by @xmath85 . in the rest frame ,",
    "the infinitesmal symmetry is @xmath86 and @xmath87 so that @xmath88 inserting the quantized fields ( [ eqn : cq ] ) we then find @xmath89 applying the spinor relation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sr4 ] ) we may verify @xmath90 , and it follows further from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : feao ] ) that @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) is a spin @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) particle state and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) is an antiparticle state of opposite spin @xmath94 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "hence the spin statistics theorem is satisfied , as expected .",
    "note that the @xmath97 and @xmath98 operators belong to the terms which form the subspace of solutions satisfying the dirac equation , as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : afdn ] ) .",
    "these operators both form spin @xmath93 or ` spin up ' states just as in the @xmath0 dirac theory , so we may also think of @xmath8 and @xmath9 to be extensions of the dirac fermions to include ` spin down ' states , though the symplectic fermions obviously have different mass dimensions .",
    "the maximal global symmetry of the free theory is sp(4 ) , which can be seen as follows .",
    "let @xmath99 where the superscript @xmath34 denotes here the transpose .",
    "applying the fermi statistics we may then rewrite the free lagrangian as @xmath100 so that clearly @xmath101 has an sp(4 , @xmath102 ) internal symmetry .",
    "note that this argument can be extended to @xmath103 component spinors , with corresponding symmetry sp(2@xmath103 , @xmath102 ) .",
    "further , it is straightforward to check that the abovementioned global symmetries u(1)@xmath36so(2,1 ) @xmath104 sp(4,@xmath102 ) by writing them as linear transformations of @xmath105 .      in @xmath0 dimensions",
    "there are two parity operators , namely @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "note that @xmath108 has determinant @xmath109 and is equivalent to a rotation , so that @xmath110 .",
    "since angular momentum in @xmath0 is the scalar @xmath111 , the parity transformations @xmath112 must both change the sense of rotation and hence we expect parity to flip spins . choosing the @xmath113 matrices to be explicitly @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where @xmath117 are the usual @xmath118 pauli matrices , we find the parity operators act on free fields as @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
