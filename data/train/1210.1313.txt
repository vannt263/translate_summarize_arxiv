    "relativistic hydrodynamics has been widely applied for studying relativistic nonequilibrium phenomena . for examples",
    ", it describes hadron spectra and elliptic flow in the heavy ion physics  @xcite , and jets like gamma - ray bursts in the astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations applied to these systems are mainly those for perfect fluids .",
    "one of reasons is that the dissipative effects in relativistic hydrodynamics are not fully understood , e.g , some pathological problems arise from the dissipative effects : the acausal propagation and the instability of the equilibrium state  @xcite .",
    "although many hydrodynamic equations have been proposed to resolve these problems @xcite , it is not still obvious which equation describes the correct behavior of the relativistic dissipative fluid .",
    "namely , even the basic equation has not been established in relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the relativistic hydrodynamic equations are generally given as the following conservation laws : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the particle current and @xmath2 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "they are decomposed to @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the particle density , @xmath5 the enthalpy density , @xmath6 the pressure , @xmath7 the energy density , @xmath8 the fluid - four velocity .",
    "the dissipative terms , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , denote the particle and energy diffusions , and the viscous stress tensor , respectively .",
    "the explicit expressions of these terms are not unique but depending on considered equations .",
    "this ambiguity comes from a choice of local rest frames of the fluid .    to see this ambiguity ,",
    "let us classify the hydrodynamic equations into two groups : the eckart and landau frames  @xcite . in the eckart frame",
    ", the local - rest frame is defined as that of the particle current , i.e. , the fluid velocity is proportional to the particle current : @xmath12 in this frame , the particle diffusion is absent , @xmath13 . on the other hand , in the landau frame , the fluid velocity is proportional to the energy current : @xmath14 in contrast to the eckart frame , the energy diffusion is absent , @xmath15 .",
    "we note that nonrelativistic hydrodynamics do not have these ambiguity . in the nonrelativistic limit ,",
    "the energy current is identical to the particle current because the mass energy dominates the energy of fluids .",
    "actually , the navier - stokes equation does not have such ambiguity and the frames .",
    "it is considered that this difference between the frames is just by the references frames and apparent . however , several differences , which are not just apparent , actually exist .",
    "for example , the eckart frame has the instability of the equilibrium state , but the landau frame does not .    to discuss the difference of the landau and eckart frames , we consider fluctuations from the global equilibrium state , namely , the linear nonequilibrium regime .",
    "the merit of this fluctuating state is that we can observe the state at the same rest frame for the energy and particle currents .",
    "we note that , at the equilibrium state , the particle and energy currents rest : @xmath16 .",
    "then , in the fluctuating state , we also have the same reference frame for the landau and eckart frames because the considered state is just perturbed from the equilibrium one ; moreover , we need not to bother about what are _ local equilibrium _ and _ local rest _ for the relativistic system .    to see relativistic hydrodynamics in the linear regime ,",
    "let us consider the landau and eckart equations as examples .",
    "for the landau equation , the dissipative terms read @xmath17                  + \\zeta\\delta^{\\mu\\nu}(\\partial_{\\perp}{\\cdot}u ) , \\label{eq : d2 }                          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the thermal conductivity , the share and bulk viscosities , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 is a projection and @xmath22 is the space - like derivative .",
    "now , we linearize the landau equation about fluctuations from the equilibrium state .",
    "let us write @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . here",
    ", the symbols with the prefix @xmath28 , denote the fluctuations .",
    "the equilibrium values are denoted by the suffix @xmath29 .",
    "hereafter , we employ variables with the suffix and the prefix as the equilibrium values and fluctuations , respectively .",
    "for simplicity , let us choose the rest frame as the reference frame : @xmath30 .",
    "then , by the relation in the linear regime , @xmath31 , the fluid - velocity fluctuation is written as @xmath32 in consequence , the landau equation is linearized as @xmath33 next , let us move on to the eckart equation . the dissipative terms of the eckart equation are @xmath34     + \\zeta\\delta^{\\mu\\nu}(\\partial_{\\perp}{\\cdot}u ) ,     \\label{eq : eck}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the time - like derivative .",
    "the linearized equations are @xmath36 we note that the linearized landau and eckart equations have different forms even in the same rest frame , as we mentioned .",
    "to investigate relativistic hydrodynamics in the linear regime , we here use mori s projection operator method @xcite .",
    "mori s projection operator method is a powerful tool for extracting slow dynamics .",
    "this method is widely applied and succeed in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "actually , various slow dynamics , e.g. the navier - stokes , langevin , boltzmann equations , and equations for nambu - goldstone bosons , are derived @xcite .",
    "the merit of the projection operator method is that we can derive slow dynamics only by choosing slow variables and commutation relations of those without microscopic details .",
    "we note that dynamics on macroscopic scale can be described by much fewer degrees of freedom than those on microscopic scale .",
    "such degrees of freedom are called the slow variables ( or gross variables ) .",
    "the slow variables are degrees of freedom that label a macroscopic state and describe long - time behavior .",
    "the view point of the projection operator method tells us that a choice of the slow variables is a key for hydrodynamics . from the linearized landau and eckart equations , ( [ eq : ln])-([eq : lj ] ) and ( [ eq : eckn])-([eq : eckj ] ) , we see that the dynamic variables are given as the energy and particle densities , and fluid - velocity fluctuations : , turn out to be functions of @xmath37 by thermodynamic relations . ]",
    "@xmath38 the fluid velocities are different depending on the frames : @xmath39 namely , the difference of the frames is the choices of the slow variables .",
    "the important point about the choices is that @xmath40 is not essentially slow because it is not a conserved charge .",
    "in contrast , @xmath41 is a conserved charge and slow because the energy current is equivalent to the momentum for the relativistic system : @xmath42 .",
    "actually , we shall find that a slow part in @xmath40 originates from @xmath43 .",
    "we will provide detail on this point in sec .",
    "[ sec : slowvariable ] and [ sec : onsager ] .",
    "then , in this paper , we will apply the projection operator method for the choices , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "( [ eq : lset ] ) , gives the linearized landau equations  ( [ eq : ln])-([eq : lj ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we will derive the equations for the second set , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eset ] ) , which include the landau and eckart frames .",
    "then , we will derive the linearized eckart equations by eliminating @xmath47 from the equations for @xmath48 .",
    "we note that , to correctly treat the slow part of @xmath49 coming from @xmath47 , we have to choose the both of them as the slow variables .",
    "after that , we will discuss properties of the derived equations .",
    "we shall show that the equations for @xmath50 and @xmath48 have the same slow modes .",
    "namely , @xmath49 contains the irrelevant part for the slow dynamics of relativistic fluids .",
    "moreover , we will illustrate that , even for the eckart equation , the slow dynamics is actually described by the landau s variables , @xmath50 .",
    "our study is first attempt for the derivation based on the projection operator method .",
    "the earlier studies @xcite assume that the relativistic boltzmann equation as an underlying microscopic theory .",
    "in contrast , we stress that our derivation is independent of microscopic details .",

    "the landau equation is solved by choosing @xmath120 and @xmath313 as the thermodynamic variables , whereas @xmath120 and @xmath119 are chosen in this paper .",
    "the difference is due to the choices and apparent . ]",
    "i.e. , the current density @xmath49 is irrelevant for slow dynamics .",
    "when does the unstable mode arise in the derivation of the eckart equation ?",
    "the unstable mode arises from the expansion about @xmath269 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zexpansion ] ) .",
    "let us now study the modes after the expansion . for simplicity",
    ", we consider only the transverse components .",
    "those are given as @xmath314 and dispersions are @xmath315 we see that there are two modes ; the first mode is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmode ] ) and the second one is unstable .",
    "we note that , before the expansion , the transverse components have the only one mode .",
    "namely , by the @xmath316 expansion , the number of modes increase and the unstable mode arises .",
    "now , we note that the eigenvalue of the unstable mode is not proportional to the wavenumber @xmath182 and large . in other words ,",
    "the unstable mode is massive and not a hydrodynamic mode .",
    "therefore , we can get rid of the unstable mode by introducing a cutoff in the frequency space because hydrodynamics is an effective theory in the low - frequency and -wavenumber region .",
    "we studied relativistic hydrodynamics in the linear regime with mori s projection operator method . from the view point of the projection operator method",
    ", we discussed that the difference of the frames is not the choices of the reference frames but rather those of the slow variables .",
    "we also found that the the slow variables for the landau frame are the conserved charges whereas those for the eckart frame include the current of the conserved charge , which is not essentially slow .",
    "in fact , we derived the slow dynamics by the projection operator method for the sets , @xmath317 and @xmath318 , as the slow variables .",
    "we first showed that the natural choice , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lset ] ) , gives the linearized landau equations .",
    "next , we derived the equations of motion for @xmath318 , which include the landau and eckart frames in the view point of the projection operator method . and then , we derived the linearized eckart equation by eliminating @xmath47 from the above equations .",
    "we also discussed properties of the derived equations .",
    "in particular , by considering the onsager relation , we illustrated that the slow part of the particle current , which is the fluid velocity for the eckart frame , is determined by landau s variables , @xmath317 .",
    "moreover , we studied how the unstable mode of the eckart equation arises .",
    "we found that the @xmath269 expansion for the elimination of @xmath47 causes the unstable mode .",
    "then , we pointed out that the unstable mode is `` massive '' and is ruled out by the cutoff in the frequency space .",
    "also , we found that the equations for @xmath318 has the same modes as the landau equation has .",
    "thus , the particle current @xmath49 is irrelevant for the first order hydrodynamics .",
    "recently , some atuhors also point out that the landua frame is natural for the relativistic hydrodynamics , based on the renormalization group method @xcite .    here",
    ", we note that this study is first for the derivation of relativistic hydrodynamics based on the projection operator method .",
    "we stress that our derivation is independent of the microscopic details ; we determine the metric from the lorentz symmetry on microscopic scale and the thermodynamics .",
    "the earlier studies @xcite assume the relativistic boltzmann equation as the underlying microscopic theory , which is , however , only valid for a weakly - correlated system like a dilute gas .",
    "furthermore , we note that our study is independent of what are the local equilibrium and the local rest in the relativistic fluids because we considered the fluctuations from globally equilibrium state . instead , our study is restricted in the linear regime .",
    "now , we comment on the lorentz covariance of linearized hydrodynamics .",
    "the linearized landau equations , ( [ eq : ln])-([eq : lj ] ) , are not lorentz covariant .",
    "the reason is the following : we here considered the fluctuations in the background medium .",
    "for such a system , the lorentz transformation boosts the fluctuations but does not the background .",
    "then , the boosted system differs from that before the boost .",
    "thus , the linearized equations are valid only for the rest frame of the medium and not lorentz covariant .",
    "actually , by the same reason , the navier - stokes equation is galilei covariant whereas the linearized one is not covariant .",
    "however , we note that the linearized navier - stokes equation well describes the fluctuation in a fluid @xcite .",
    "namely , linearized hydrodynamics has no problem in the linear regime .    in this paper",
    ", we used the linear projection operator , and our study is restricted in the linear regime .",
    "then , it is interesting to derive relativistic hydrodynamics by the nonlinear projection operator @xcite .",
    "we note that , for nonrelativistic fluids , the full navier - stokes equation is derived by the nonlinear one @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we here focused and discussed the landau and eckart frames .",
    "then , we concluded that the landau frame is natural for the slow dynamics .",
    "however , other open problems of relativistic hydrodynamics , such as the acausal propagation , have not been solved yet",
