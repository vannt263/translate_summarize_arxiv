    "the cold dark matter paradigm ( @xmath2cdm ) provides a remarkably good description of cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "however , observations connected with small scales might be in tension with this framework . in particular , structure formation simulations to date assuming @xmath2cdm predict a greater number of galaxy satellites and suggest that the density profiles of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) should exhibit cusps , in contrast to observations @xcite .",
    "some cores might be explained by baryonic feedback e.g.  @xcite , but this is still undecided @xcite , indicating the possibility of a more fundamental discrepancy .",
    "it is of interest to look at potential resolutions from dark matter effects beyond @xmath2cdm , such as warm dark matter @xcite , self - interactions @xcite , or boson degeneracy @xcite .",
    "an interesting alternative resolution was proposed by @xcite as well as @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who observed that a sub - kev fermion dark matter particle could resolve the core - cusp problem when quantum pressure due to fermi repulsion provides the dominant support in the central regions of dwarf galaxies . in this scenario ,",
    "the cores of dwarf galaxies are highly analogous to white dwarfs or neutron stars , both of which are supported by degeneracy pressure .",
    "this proposal would have the remarkable implication that the structure of dwarf galaxies arises due to a quantum effect on a cosmic scale .",
    "however , dark matter composed of a thermal relic lighter than a few kev would erase small scale density perturbations , in conflict with observations @xcite .",
    "thus the prospect of fermi pressure playing a role in the structure of dwarf galaxies is lost for dark matter at the baryonic temperature . however , this scenario might be realized when dark matter is not in thermal contact with baryons so it is cooler  when dark matter is decoupled and is not reheated by the standard model , for example .",
    "the dark matter would then be non - relativistic earlier than a thermal relic , mitigating free streaming bounds . for models that realize such a scenario",
    "see for instance : @xcite    another possibility is that the lower limit on the dark matter mass is relaxed by a late - entropy release , as with `` flooded dark matter '' ( fdm ) @xcite . in this class of models",
    "the standard model undergoes late - time reheating via entropy injections from long - lived heavy states decaying to the visible sector .",
    "we provide a brief outline of the minimal model of flooded dark matter in appendix [ sec : fdm ] .",
    "we recast the warm dark matter mass bounds derived from lyman-@xmath1 data into constraints on models such as this one with colder temperature and find the following mass limit for flooded dark matter m_fdm 470  ev n_f^-  , in terms of @xmath3 ` flavors ' of majorana fermion dark matter .",
    "this value is borderline for resolving the core - cusp problem but might work well with baryonic feedback in explaining the variability in core sizes that is observed so far .",
    "the full set of constraints we present is :    * lower mass bound from fit to cores : @xcite find a preference for a narrow dark matter mass range @xmath4 ev @xmath5 ev .",
    "once we include the effects of a thermal envelope these constraints reduce to @xmath6 ev , with no upper bound on the mass . * upper mass bound from core size : both @xcite and @xcite find a two sigma constraint of @xmath7 parsec , which would imply @xmath8 ev .",
    "when we partially redo their analysis with a burkert profile for dark matter we obtain smaller preferred values @xmath9 kpc .",
    "our limited analysis does not recover their result but when we fit their data using a fermi core with two scales ( core radius and scale radius ) , we obtain an even smaller core @xmath10 kpc , consistent with a larger fermion mass of @xmath11  ev .",
    "we can conclude , based on comparing our one - scale and two - scale results , that that the profile with the fermi - degenerate core ( and hence two scales ) should reduce the lower bound on the core size and increase the upper bound on the mass of the fermion to @xmath12  ev .",
    "* lower mass bound from largest allowed core size : @xcite also put an upper bound on core size at @xmath13 level @xmath14 kpc for the fornax dsph which implies @xmath15  ev lower mass bound . * lower mass bounds from black hole formation : we show that @xmath16 ev suffices to avoid forming black holes out of degenerate fermi gas cores of dwarf galaxies .",

    "[ eq : wdmfdmeq ] .",
    "the most conservative , even weaker , bound for warm dark matter was @xmath20 kev , corresponding to @xmath21 ev .",
    "we later argue that using a flavored dark matter model we can relax the lyman-@xmath1 bounds arbitrarily , at the cost of more complicated dark matter model .",
    "alternatively , while the lyman-@xmath1 constraint ( @xmath21 ev ) is in tension with the mass range for which appropriately large cores are obtained ( @xmath22 ev ) , this bound can be reconciled if the dark matter has a non - thermal momentum distribution",
    ". we will discuss one way to achieve such a nonthermal scenario .    in any case , the coring mechanism based on fermi degeneracy operates in conjunction with baryonic feedback and it is quite likely that baryonic feedback creates a large core in the fornax galaxy for example . as a result",
    "it may be the case that only _",
    "smaller _ cores in systems such as draco need to be resolved by new physics , in which case the lyman-@xmath1 constraints become irrelevant .    in what follows",
    ", we extend and improve the analysis of @xcite .",
    "the earlier study made the simplifying assumption of a completely degenerate fermi gas , which is not appropriate for realistic scenarios .",
    "we treat the dark matter as a quasi - degenerate fermi gas surrounded by a thermal envelope .",
    "furthermore , we highlight concerns regarding the criteria used in matching to observed data and clarify the condition under which dsphs would be successfully cored through fermi pressure .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : fermirep ] we outline the physics of self gravitating fermi gases and the role of fermi repulsion in determining the density profile .",
    "we argue that even with sharp power law density profiles dwarf galaxies can not accommodate arbitrarily large central densities and that fermi repulsion is generally important in the central region . in section [ sec :",
    "fits ] , using the empirically motivated criterion that dwarf spheroidal galaxies should feature a core of order a few hundred pc , we determine the parameters that yield appropriate sized cores .",
    "we point out essential details , such as the importance of stellar anisotropy degeneracy with reference to @xcite .",
    "we also supplement with newer data to reproduce observed properties of the classical milky way dwarf galaxies . in section",
    "[ sec : lowermassbounds ] , we derive a number of lower bounds on the mass of fermion dark matter . in section",
    "[ sec : chandra ] , we discuss the lower bound on the mass of fermion dark matter from the requirement that dwarf cores do not collapse into black holes .",
    "appendix [ apb ] presents certain definitions and derivations that we use in the main text and appendix [ apmodels ] gives more details about the models we discuss in this paper .",
    "we first argue that in the absence of a central black hole , sufficiently light fermionic dark matter manifests fermi repulsion that would be relevant in the central region of dwarf galaxies . assuming a cuspy profile as a starting point",
    ", there would always exist a central region with density high enough that the fermi velocity would exceed the escape velocity so the density in the central region would be inconsistent with the pauli exclusion principle and would have to be reduced .",
    "we later show that full solutions including fermi pressure lead to cored density distributions .",
    "a fermionic gas of density @xmath23 is degenerate at temperatures below t_deg&~ ( ) ^  , [ eq : deg ] where @xmath24 is the mass of the fermion . in this regime",
    "the highest occupation level is @xmath25 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) p_f = m v_f = h ( ) ^  , leading to the fermi pressure in the non - relativistic limit : p_f=_0^p_fdp ( ) = ( ) ^ ^  , [ eq : pf ] which at high density and low temperature dominates over the classical pressure ( we choose units such that @xmath26 ) p_cl= ( ) .",
    "[ eq : cl ] a typical temperature at any point inside this ball is determined by the virial condition t(r)=. therefore , the classical pressure can be estimated to be p_cl=.

    "[ eqr ] we claim that for an integrable density profile one can always find a radius below which the fermi velocity is larger than escape velocity @xmath29 , leading to an inconsistent density profile , because states with @xmath30 will escape the gravitational potential , thus reducing the central density .",

    "having shown that a integrable profile always leads to fermi degeneracy ( for a sufficiently small mass - dependent region ) , we now consider non - integrable profiles ( which do not satisfy the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ eqr ] ) ) . since these profiles lead to an unphysical infinite total mass in the center of the distribution they must be cut off at some small radius @xmath45 . below the cutoff @xmath46 the profile transitions to an integrable profile . rather than focus on the outer region , we consider the central cutoff region , which we parameterize solely by the mass @xmath47 enclosed and the cut - off radius @xmath46 .",
    "we determine the minimum radius required to fit a typical dwarf galaxy mass inside a given size as a function of the fermion mass , where we require that the escape velocity is larger than the fermi velocity everywhere inside the gas .",
    "this happens for v_esc^2 = > v_f^2 = ( 3 ^ 2 ) ^  .",

    "therefore for light fermion masses , @xmath46 needs to be similar to , or greater than , the dwarf galaxy size . in other words ,",
    "the system should be described by an integrable profile over the whole range .",
    "one might suppose that rather than a soft profile below the cutoff of a sharp profile one could encounter a sequence of nested singular profiles .",
    "however , ultimately this sequence must be cut off at some @xmath45 at which the profile becomes non - singular , and the argument above still applies .",
    "having reduced to the previous case , we conclude that a fermi degenerate region must always be present in a physically relevant region .",
