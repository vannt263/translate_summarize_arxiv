    "the factorization ( or vacuum insertion ) prescription was first proposed long time ago  @xcite and , after the discovery of the standard model , it was revived  @xcite , has been improved and applied extensively to hadronic weak decays of heavy mesons  @xcite .",
    "the improved one has been supported by two independent arguments , i.e. , one is the large @xmath9 ( color degree of freedom ) argument  @xcite that the factorizable amplitude which is given by the leading terms in the large @xmath9 expansion dominates in hadronic weak decays and the other is the color transparency argument@xcite that the factorization works well under a particular kinematical condition , i.e. , a heavy quark decays into another heavy quark plus a pair of light quark and anti - quark which are emitted colinearly with sufficiently high energies , for example , as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes a color singlet @xmath12 pair . in the former case ,",
    "if the factorization works well in @xmath13 decays , it will again work well in @xmath14 and charm decays since the large @xmath9 argument is independent of flavors . on the other hand , in the latter case",
    ", it can not work well in @xmath14 and charm decays where the kinematics can not satisfy the above condition , even if it works well in @xmath13 decays .",
    "we here consider two body decays of charm mesons to check if the large @xmath9 argument works well in hadronic weak interactions .",
    "a naive application of the factorization prescription to charm decays leads to the color suppression [ suppression of color mismatched decays , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , etc .",
    ", described by @xmath17 .",
    "it means , for example , that the amplitude for the @xmath18 meson decays into isospin @xmath19 @xmath20 final states is approximately cancelled by the one into @xmath21 @xmath20 final states and hence the phases of these amplitudes are nearly equal to each other .",
    "therefore the factorized amplitudes for two body decays of charm mesons should be approximately real except for the overall phase .",
    "however the measured rates for these decays are not compatible with the color suppression and the amplitudes for @xmath22 and @xmath23 decays have large phase differences between the amplitudes for decays into the @xmath19 and @xmath24 final states  @xcite .",
    "to get rid of this problem , the factorization has been implemented by taking account for final state interactions .",
    "however , amplitudes with final state interactions are given by non - leading terms in the large @xmath9 expansion as will be discussed later , so that the large @xmath9 argument does not work well in charm decays and hence also in @xmath13 decays since the large @xmath9 argument is independent of flavors . on the other hand ,",
    "if the color transparency argument works well , the factorization will be a good approximation in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays while , in the @xmath8 and @xmath3 , the factorization can not be a good approximation ( in contrast with in the large @xmath9 argument ) but non - factorizable long distance contribution can play a role .    in this article , we study @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays . in the next section , we will review briefly the effective weak hamiltonian and our basic perspective . in sec .",
    "iii , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays will be studied by decomposing their amplitude into a sum of factorizable and non - factorizable ones .",
    "the former will be estimated by using the naive factorization while the latter is calculated by using a hard pion approximation in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) . we will estimate phenomenologically allowed branching ratios from the measured ones and compare our result with the estimated ones as well as the measured ones .",
    "as the consequence , it will be seen that the factorization works fairly well but non - factorizable contributions are still not negligible . in sec .",
    "iv , the color suppressed decays , @xmath8 and @xmath3 , will be investigated in the same way .",
    "a brief summary will be given in the final section .",
    "before we study amplitudes for @xmath13 decays , we review briefly the @xmath25 effective weak hamiltonian . its main part is usually written in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the wilson coefficients of the four quark operators , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , given by products of color singlet left - handed currents , @xmath31 the renormalization scale ( @xmath32 ) dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath34 is not explicitly described unless it is required .",
    "@xmath35 s denote the ckm matrix elements  @xcite which are taken to be real since cp invariance is always assumed in this article .",
    "when we calculate factorizable amplitudes for the @xmath36 and @xmath1 decays later , we use , as usual , the so - called bsw hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath37 which can be obtained from eq.([eq : hw ] ) by using the fierz reordering , where the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 in eq.([eq : hw - bsw ] ) should be no longer fierz reordered .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 where @xmath9 is the color degree of freedom .",
    "when @xmath41 is obtained , an extra term which is given by a color singlet sum of products of colored currents , @xmath42 comes out , where @xmath43 with the generators @xmath44 of the color @xmath45 symmetry .    to realize physical amplitudes for @xmath13 decays by matrix elements of @xmath46 , soft gluon(s )",
    "should be exchanged between quarks which belong to different meson states or different currents .",
    "therefore , amplitudes given by @xmath46 correspond to non - leading terms in the large @xmath9 expansion and are not factorizable , i.e. , @xmath46 is responsible for non - factorizable amplitudes .",
    "the above can be described schematically in fig .  1 , where we have not explicitly shown soft gluon exchange(s ) between quarks belonging to the same meson and the same current for    = 0.75    fig .  1 .",
    "quark - line diagrams describing a hadronic weak decay of meson into two meson final states .",
    "connectedness of quark - lines are assumed .",
    "the bullet denotes the weak vertex with perturbative qcd corrections and the spiral line denotes the soft - gluon(s ) .",
    "soft - gluon exchange(s ) between quarks belonging to the same meson and the same current are not explicitly described .",
    "the diagrams ( a ) and ( c ) correspond to the leading terms in the large @xmath9 expansion while ( b ) and ( d ) to the non - leading terms .    simplicity . in the diagrams (",
    "a ) and ( c ) , no soft gluon(s ) are exchanged between quarks belonging to different mesons or different currents .",
    "therefore , the amplitudes described by these diagrams which correspond to the leading term in the large @xmath9 expansion are factorizable . in these diagrams , the weak vertices are given by products of color singlet currents as in @xmath41 .",
    "however , the diagrams ( b ) and ( d ) correspond to non - leading terms and are non - factorizable since soft gluon(s ) are exchanged between quarks belonging to different mesons or different currents , so that the weak vertices in these diagrams are given by products of colored currents as in @xmath46 . in the large @xmath9 argument ,",
    "the latter is neglected while , in the color transparency , it is not guaranteed that the latter can be neglected .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 and @xmath46 are responsible for factorizable and non - factorizable amplitudes , respectively .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we start to study nonleptonic weak decays decomposing their amplitude into a sum of _ factorizable _ and _ non - factorizable _ ones  @xcite .",
    "the former is estimated by using the naive factorization in the bsw scheme  @xcite .",
    "the latter will be calculated later by using a hard pion approximation in the infinite momentum frame ( imf )  @xcite .",
    "the hard pion amplitude will be given by _",
    "asymptotic _ matrix elements of @xmath46 ( matrix elements of @xmath46 taken between single hadron states with infinite momentum ) .",
    "now we consider , as an example , the factorizable amplitude for the @xmath47 decay .",
    "it is given by @xmath48 in the bsw scheme .",
    "factorizable amplitudes for the other @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays also can be calculated in the same way .",
    "to evaluate these amplitudes , we use the following parameterization of matrix elements of currents@xcite , @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 and the form factors satisfy @xmath52 to get rid of useless imaginary unit in the amplitude , however , we take the following parameterization of matrix element of vector current@xcite , @xmath53 which can be treated in parallel to those of axial vector currents in eq.([eq : pcac ] ) in the imf . using these expressions of current matrix elements , we obtain the factorized amplitudes for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays in table  1 , where we have put @xmath54 and factored out the ckm matrix elements . as seen in table  1 , the color suppressed amplitudes are proportional to the small coefficient , @xmath39 , and therefore they are suppressed .    before we evaluate numerically the factorized amplitudes , we study non - factorizale amplitudes for the @xmath55 [ and @xmath56 decays .",
    "the amplitudes for hadronic weak ( two - body ) decays with final state interactions will be described by diagrams similar to ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "1 in which soft gluon(s ) are replaced by @xmath57 pair(s ) [ i.e. , meson(s ) ] , so that such amplitudes will be given by hadron dynamics and correspond to non - leading terms in the large @xmath9 expansion as mentioned before .",

    "the observed branching ratios for these decays can be well reproduced in terms of a sum of the hard pion amplitude and the factorized one .",
    "namely , the factorized amplitudes are dominant but not necessarily complete and long distance hadron dynamics should be carefully taken into account in hadronic weak interactions of @xmath13 mesons . in color suppressed @xmath293 , @xmath5 , @xmath282 and @xmath294 decays , non - factorizable long distance contributions are more important . in particular , in the @xmath8 decays , long distance physics should be treated carefully . when @xmath295 with the lo qcd corrections is taken instead of the phenomenological @xmath292 , it is hard to reproduce the measured @xmath296 and @xmath297 even if a sum of factorized and non - factorizable amplitudes is taken as long as @xmath298 .",
    "the non - factorizable amplitudes are proportional to asymptotic ground - state - meson matrix elements of @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath156 or @xmath270 . to reproduce the measured rates for the color favored @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays",
    ", the non - factorizable contributions may not be negligible ( @xmath299 ) while too large values of @xmath156 and @xmath270 will lead to too large rates for the color suppressed decays . however , their numerical results are still ambiguous since the amplitudes for the color suppressed decays are sensitive to model dependent form factors",
    ".    experimental data on exclusive decays , in particular , decays into charm - less final states , of @xmath13 mesons are rapidly increasing after the @xmath13 factories . in these decays ,",
    "the factorization will not be a good approximation since the large @xmath9 argument does not work in hadronic weak processes and since these decays are outside of applicability of the color transparency , so that non - factorizable contributions are expected to be very important in these decays . besides",
    ", some of these decays are expected to play important roles in determination of @xmath300-violating parameters .",
    "therefore , non - factorizable contribution in exclusive decays of @xmath13 mesons is now and will be , in near future , one of very important subjects .",
