    "the instability of an electron gas due to strong correlations at the conditions of dhva effect resulting in diamagnetic phase transition ( dpt ) into inhomogeneous diamagnetic phase ( idp ) with formation of condon domains ( cds ) @xcite , @xcite is intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the realization of intrinsic structure of idp is governed by the competition between long - range dipole - dipole interaction and short - range interaction related to the positive interface energy with typical magnetic length of larmor radius .",
    "the observed idp in ag by splitting of nmr line @xcite was identified as periodic domain structure with alternating in neighboring domains one - component magnetization .",

    "the attempts of the quantitative analysis of the data on the basis of model of plane - parallel band patterns reveal the contradictions @xcite , put questions on correctness of applicability of demagnetizing coefficient for adequate description of shape - dependent properties of idp @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and raised important unanswered questions concerning the type of the diamagnetic ordering , irreversibility of dpt and morphology of the domain patterns .",
    "there are striking similarities between idp in normal metals and other strongly correlated systems which undergo phase transition on temperature and magnetic field with formation of complex macroscopic patterns , e. g. the type - i superconductors and thin magnetic films .",
    "the different technics , including the powder pattern and magneto - optic methods , successfully used for observation of intermediate state of type - i superconductors revealed a very rich structure @xcite which in spite of all it complexity , amazingly reminds the variety of domain structures in thin film @xcite .",
    "recent experimental observation of cds by a set of micro hall probes at the surface of a plate - like sample of ag @xcite demonstrates the formation of complex structure which differs from the expected regular cd patterns separated by plane - parallel dws @xcite and calls for further development of the experimental techniques to study the idp .",
    "the first experimental observation of such an exotic phenomena as diamagnetic hysteresis by complex method including direct measurements by hall probe , standard ac method with different modulation levels , frequencies and magnetic field ramp rates @xcite allows to reconstruct the magnetization reversal in be and confirms the possibility of the first order phase transition .",
    "the giant parametric amplification of non - linear response which proves to be sensitive method for investigation of phase transitions in superconductors was observed in a single crystal of be in quantizing magnetic field @xcite , where the measured output signal amazingly follows the shape of the dpt diagram and shows the asymmetry and shift to the upper edge of the dhva period in ascending magnetic field justifying the possibility of the first order dpt and necessity of further development of the theory of dpt .",
    "motivated by recent data on observation of dpt instability @xcite-@xcite , in the framework of catastrophe theory we investigate the equilibrium set for the system of strongly correlated electron gas at the conditions of dhva effect .",
    "we show that in every period of dhva oscillations the discontinuities of order parameter accompanied dpt is handled by riemann - hugoniot catastrophe implying the standard scenario for the transition , e.g. dpt is of the second order at the center of dhva period , weakly first order in the nearest vicinity of this point and is of the first order at the rest part of the dhva period both on @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 .",

    "<S> in a framework of catastrophe theory we investigate the equilibrium set for the system of strongly correlated electron gas at the conditions of dhva effect and show that the discontinuities accompanied the diamagnetic phase transition ( dpt ) is handled by riemann - hugoniot catastrophe . </S>",
    "<S> we show that applicability of the standard condition for observation of dpt @xmath01 where @xmath1 is the differential magnetic susceptibility is valid only in the nearest vicinity of triple degenerate point corresponding to the center of dhva period , but for arbitrary value of magnetic field in every period of dhva oscillations this condition is modified in accordance with the bifurcation set of cusp catastrophe . while at the center of dhva period the symmetric supercritical pitchfork bifurcation gives rise to the second order phase transition on temperature , the deviation of magnetic field from the value corresponding to the center of dhva period results in the change of the phase transition order from the second to the first one both on temperature and magnetic field . in the framework of developed theory </S>",
    "<S> we obtain good agreement with available experimental data . </S>"
