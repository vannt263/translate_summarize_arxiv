    "a fruitful approach to study the confined phase of qcd is the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model , in which the equation of state is obtained by assuming a gas of non - interacting massive stable and point - like particles , which are taken as the conventional hadrons  @xcite .",
    "this model has arbitrated the discrepancies between the different collaborations in the lattice community  @xcite .",
    "the effort to study the thermodynamics of qcd has led also to important advances in the study of the interquark forces at finite temperature .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the polyakov loop is related to the propagator of a static quark , and it has been used as an order parameter for the confinement / deconfinement transition of color charges  @xcite .",
    "the free energy of a heavy @xmath1 pair in a thermal medium , which can be computed from the correlation function of polyakov loops , has important phenomenological consequences in the study of quarkonia physics in heavy ion experiments  @xcite . in line with the hrg approach",
    "we have proposed recently  @xcite a hadronic representation for the vacuum expectation value of the polyakov loop which has been quite successful in describing the available lattice data up to @xmath2  @xcite . in this communication",
    "we represent the heavy @xmath1 free energy in terms of the hrg , and compare with recent lattice simulations .",
    "one of the most studied quantities in qcd is the static energy between heavy sources , such as heavy quark systems  @xcite and also for more exotic states like gluelumps  @xcite .",
    "we will present in this section the most relevant properties of this interaction which will be used later in the study of the heavy @xmath0 free energy .",

    "the coulomb - like term accounts for the perturbative behavior from one - gluon exchange at short distances , while the confining linearly growing term accounts for the energy of the string connecting the two heavy quarks .",
    "casimir scaling implies a relation between the fundamental @xmath8 and adjoint @xmath9 color sources given by @xmath10 , and holds on the lattice for @xmath11  @xcite and for heavy sources in the fundamental representation @xmath12 at @xmath13  @xcite .",

    ", one can study the transition between a @xmath18 system and a meson - antimeson system . when the separation between the two heavy quarks increases , the energy of the system rises linearly due to the string tension term .",
    "eventually this system becomes unstable at a critical distance  @xmath19 when a light @xmath20 is created from the vacuum , so that a heavy - light meson - antimeson @xmath21 channel opens .    neglecting the meson - antimeson interaction ,",
    "the energies of these channels are @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the heavy - light meson ( the mass of the heavy quark itself @xmath24 being subtracted ) . using these formulas",
    ", one can estimate the string breaking to be @xmath25  @xcite , where @xmath26 is the constituent quark mass , which is in fair agreement with lattice results  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the @xmath18 state can decay into any of the many excited states of the meson spectrum after @xmath27 pair creation from the vacuum , i.e. @xmath28 , or to the baryon spectrum , as long as they have the same quantum numbers as the @xmath18 system .",

    "however , the existence of a transition potential @xmath31 between the two states , implies the matrix interaction @xmath32 after diagonalization , the finite energy of the non - diagonal @xmath33 interaction lifts the degeneracy , a feature called level repulsion , and there emerges the picture of adiabatic avoided crossing shown in fig .",

    "is related to the correlator between polyakov loops in the following way @xcite @xmath36 this is the color averaged free energy , which follows from the thermal average of singlet and adjoint free energies , see e.g.  @xcite . from other conventions found in the literature .",

    "[ fig : fazantowisgur](b ) .    in view of this , one may wonder whether this effect in the string tension could be effectively due to the existence of an appreciable mixing between the string and the excited states in the lattice calculation of  @xcite . to investigate this possibility",
    ", we take a simple model consisting of only two coupled states , the @xmath1 pair ( string state ) and the lightest meson - antimeson state : @xmath50 as a first estimate , we assume for the mixing a function of the form @xmath51 from a fit of the lowest temperature lattice data of  @xcite for the heavy @xmath1 free energy , @xmath52 , one gets @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "we have taken @xmath55 corresponding to the lowest heavy - light meson state of the isgur model .",

    "[ fig : plotffodort150 ] where one can see that the mixing mimics a larger value of the string tension at distances @xmath56 .",
    "the behavior of the first excited state at short distances is in qualitative agreement with lattice simulations , see e.g. ref .",
    "this result leads to the problem of the identification of the parameter @xmath57 with the mass of some particle . at first sight",
    "it would be tempting to assume that @xmath57 should be the pion mass , however , the value we get for @xmath57 is heavier by a factor @xmath58 .",
    "the model dependence of this result can be relaxed by not assuming any functional form for the mixing @xmath59 .",
    "to do so , for each point of the lattice data @xcite at a given temperature we obtain the value of @xmath60 that allows the two states model , eq .",

    ", one would need to include a huge amount of states to reproduce the polyakov loop .",
    "even after including all the available states of the isgur model , the sum rule for the polyakov loop can not be saturated for temperatures above @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , and to avoid a source of error in @xmath59 coming from the value of @xmath65 , we have used for @xmath65 the value extracted from the lattice data .",
    "this is not necessary for the lowest temperature @xmath66 , as the sum rule is saturated in this case .",
    "we have studied a natural extension of the hrg model to the heavy @xmath0 free energy .",
    "this quantity has been computed in the confined phase of qcd from a string and the hrg model with heavy - light hadrons , and compared with existing lattice computations @xcite giving an excellent agreement for @xmath67 .",
    "the relevance of string breaking at large distances has been discussed as well .",
    "finally , we have investigated the possible role played by the avoided crossings between the string and the spectrum of hadrons .",
    "our analysis of the avoided crossings leads to possible contradicting results when analyzing the lattice data for the heavy @xmath1 free energy from two different groups .",
    "while the interaction between the string state and meson - antimeson states seems to be negligible in the data from  @xcite , a noticeable effect appears in the analysis of the more recent data of  @xcite",
    ". this could be well due to the different approaches for quark masses assumed in these references , or the different renormalization prescriptions .",
    "so , more accurate lattice data and better agreement between different groups would be desirable on the one hand .",
    "on the other hand , our analysis can be improved either by including some subleading effects like string excitations or extending the two states mixing model with the inclusion of more states in the spectrum .",
