    "the environment is known to be a major driver in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "its influence is best visible through the well - known morphology - density relationship , according to which early - type galaxies and morphologically undisturbed galaxies are preferentially found in high density environments and vice versa @xcite .",
    "the existence of this environmental footprint is well established , and has been repeatedly confirmed both in the local @xcite and intermediate redshift universe @xcite . while the exact mechanisms responsible for this effect are still debated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its mere existence is in good agreement with the idea of hierarchical structure formation based on cold dark matter cosmology @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it is less clear whether the environment is equally important at a given galaxy morphology .",
    "there is still major controversy about whether the formation and evolution of the most massive and morphologically most regular galaxies in the universe , i.e.  early - type galaxies , are affected by environmental densities . in (",
    "* hereafter t05 ) studying the local early - type galaxy population ( what we call the astro - archaeology approach ) we find significant evolution as a function of environment in agreement with a large number of investigations in the literature @xcite . in summary ,",
    "early - type galaxies in lower densities appear younger by @xmath4gyr at given galaxy mass .",
    "these differences should become even more pronounced when probing earlier epochs . as discussed in the review by @xcite",
    ", however , studies of the intermediate redshift early - type galaxy population do not confirm this picture .",
    "the same colour evolution for both field and cluster galaxies is found in recent redshift surveys @xcite . this negligible influence from the environment",
    "is further supported by investigations of the fundamental plane of ellipticals , star formation rates , luminosity function etc . back to redshift @xmath5 , that again find similar evolution in clusters and in the field @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite study clusters at @xmath6 with a large range of x - ray properties and also find a relatively small influence of the environment on the colour - magnitude relation .    with this paper",
    "we utilise the sdss database to check the result found in t05 via an increase of the sample size by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides the opportunity to explore huge homogeneous samples of early - type galaxies in the nearby universe , comprising several ten thousands of objects , so that a statistically meaningful investigation of the stellar population parameters of galaxies and their dependence on environment can be attempted .",
    "we analyse the stellar population parameters luminosity - weighted age , metallicity , and @xmath2  element ratio of 3,360 early - type galaxies drawn from the sdss in a narrow redshift range ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "a major strength of our approach is the application of strict morphological selection criteria based on visual inspection of 48,023 galaxies .",
    "we confirm the basic result of t05 as far as archaeological downsizing and the major formation epochs of early - type galaxies are concerned .",
    "however , different from t05 , the latter turn out to be insensitive to changes of the environment for the bulk of the early - type galaxy population .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe in brief the construction of the galaxy catalogue , and the method to derive stellar population parameters .",
    "the results on stellar population scaling relations are presented in section  3 , galaxy formation epochs are discussed in section  4 .",
    "the paper concludes with discussion of the results and literature comparison in sections  5 and  6 .",
    "the sample utilised here is part of a project called moses : * * mo**rphologically * * s**elected * * e**arly - types in * * s**dss .",
    "we have collected a magnitude limited sample of 48,023 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath7 with apparent @xmath8-band magnitude brighter than 16.8 from the sdss data release 4 @xcite .",
    "model magnitudes are used throughout this work .",
    "the most radical difference with respect to other galaxy samples constructed from sdss is our choice of purely morphological selection of galaxy type .",
    "all galaxies in this sample have been visually inspected and classified by eye into early- and late - type morphology .",
    "we have already used this approach in @xcite , and more details on the morphological selection and other sample characteristics can be found there . in the following ,",
    "we provide a brief summary with focus on the aspects that are most relevant for the present work .",
    "we _ visually _ inspected the 48,023 objects and divided the sample in 31,521 late - type ( spiral arms , clear disc - like structures ) and 16,502 early - type ( roundish , elliptically shaped ) galaxies .",
    "hence , 34 per cent of the objects are classified as early - type. this is in good agreement with the typical value found in average environments ( see references in the introduction ) . for the present study we aim to minimise contamination by late - type galaxies ,",
    "hence our relatively strict selection criteria yield a conservative early - type galaxy fraction that is slightly smaller than the recent determination based on sdss by ( @xmath9 per cent , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but in good agreement with other determinations in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "elliptically shaped objects with irregular structures , potentially indicative of tidal tails originating from recent galaxy - galaxy interaction / merger events , were included in the early - type category .",
    "the principal aim was to separate spiral and disc - like galaxies from early - types .",
    "the major advantage of this strategy is that our sample is not biased against star forming elliptical galaxies .",
    "no further selection criteria based on stellar population properties such as colour , spectral shape , or concentration index have been applied .",
    "indeed , this catalogue differs most from previous sdss - based early - type galaxy catalogues ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) through its inclusion of ( typically low - mass ) objects with unusually blue colours .",
    "we have extended this approach recently through the galaxy zoo project @xcite , which uses several ten thousands of volunteers on the internet to classify galaxies through a web interface . among other projects ,",
    "these classifications have led to the construction of a large sample of blue early - type galaxies ( schawinski et al 2009b ; see also kannappan et al 2009 ) .      for the estimate of the environmental density",
    "we adopt the method developed and described in full detail in @xcite and @xcite . in a nutshell",
    ", we calculate the local number density of objects brighter than a certain absolute magnitude in a @xmath10mpc sphere around the object of interest .",
    "a gaussian weight function centred on the object ensures to avoid contamination from neighbouring structures , and an adjustment of the side length of the sphere in redshift direction is invoked in order to account for the finger of god effect. we have tested various sizes for the gaussian weight functions and found that the final results of this work are not sensitive to the particular size of the sphere around @xmath10mpc . note that the results using spheres of only a few mpc size were noisier because of the sparse sampling by sdss fibers .",
    "the @xmath10mpc chosen here can be considered conservative for the purposes of this work in that this choice assures the definition of low environmental density to indicate truly isolated regions .",
    "we obtain the 3-dimensional volume density at the location of each object , hence an estimate of the _ local _ environmental density .",
    "this process does not constrain the overall structure in which the object resides , but is a sophisticated number density providing a measure of the number and proximity of galaxies around a point in space . in other words , we can not distinguish the outskirts of a galaxy cluster from a group environment of the same local density .",
    "we decided not to include further constraints like cross - correlation with cluster catalogues like in , e.g. , @xcite , because also this method suffers from incompleteness problems .",
    "more generally speaking , we did not attempt to correlate our density estimates with physical structures , as we are not aiming for classifications such as field , group , or cluster. in any case , as discussed in section  5 , our results are overall consistent with other sdss studies in the literature as far as the general influence of the environment is concerned .",
    "the kinematics of gas and stars are determined for all 48,023 objects , using the code gandalf developed by @xcite .",
    "stellar population and emission line templates are fitted _ simultaneously _ to the galaxy spectrum .",
    "the outcome are emission line fluxes and kinematics of the gas . on the stellar population side ,",
    "we obtain line - of - sight velocity dispersions based on the pixel fitting method of @xcite with a typical error of @xmath11dex in @xmath12 .",
    "the error distribution deviates from a gaussian with a sharp cut - off at @xmath13dex and a tail extending to larger errors of @xmath14dex . through the subtraction of the emission line spectrum from the observed one",
    ", we get the clean absorption line spectrum free from emission line contamination .",
    "this spectrum is used for any further analysis of absorption features .",
    "the stellar template spectrum is not used for scientific analyses .    on each spectrum , we measure the 25 standard lick absorption line indices @xcite following the most recent index definitions of @xcite . for this purpose",
    "the spectral resolution is reduced to the wavelength - dependent lick resolution @xcite .",
    "the measurements are then corrected for velocity dispersion broadening .",
    "the correction factor is evaluated using the best fitting stellar template and velocity dispersion obtained previously .",
    "errors are determined by monte carlo simulations on each spectrum individually based on the signal - to - noise ratios provided by the sdss .",
    "it should be noted that an important step in the measurement of lick indices can not be undertaken . ideally , lick standard stars need to be observed with the same instrument set - up , in order to determine ( and correct for ) offsets caused by the shape of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "this is in principle necessary , as the lick / ids system is not based on flux - calibrated spectra .",
    "such calibration stars at sufficiently high signal - to - noise are not available in sdss .",
    "however , it ought to be expected that the shape of the spectrum is of little importance for absorption indices where line feature and pseudo - continuum windows are narrow and close enough in wavelength . this condition is actually fulfilled for most lick indices with the pseudo - continuum bands being placed directly adjacent to the line feature itself .",
    "a detailed analysis of lick standard stars extracted from the sdss archive suggests that deviations from the true lick system are indeed negligible @xcite .",
    "we use the stellar population models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tmb ) to derive luminosity - weighted ages , metallicities , and @xmath2  ratios from the lick absorption line indices by means of the minimised @xmath15 technique introduced by @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for this choice is that the @xmath15 fitting is very efficient and fast , and can easily be applied to large data sets like sdss .",
    "a further advantage is that it considers a large wavelength range of the spectrum and hence gives a better estimate of the real average population . finally , the consideration of a larger set of absorption features increases the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "errors are obtained from the probability function based on the @xmath15 distribution . in practice , we search for the combination of those three parameters that minimise the @xmath15 between model and observational data for all 25 indices observed .",
    "this is different from the approach followed in t05 , where only a selection of well calibrated indices is considered to constrain the stellar population parameters directly rather than in a statistical fashion .",
    "it has been shown , however , that these two orthogonal methods yield consistent results @xcite .",
    "we follow an iterative approach . in the first step",
    "we fit all 25 indices .",
    "we compute the probability distribution for different values of @xmath15 at its minimum using the incomplete @xmath16 function .",
    "this yields the probability @xmath17 that the observed @xmath15 for a correct model should be less than the value @xmath15 obtained in the fit . if @xmath18 we deem the fit unacceptable . in this case",
    "we discard the index with the largest @xmath15 from the fitting procedure , re - do the fit , and re - calculate @xmath17 .",
    "this procedure is iterated until @xmath19 .",
    "the indices ca4455 and nad were discarded in more than 10 per cent of the cases , and were hence generally excluded .",
    "their exclusion is further supported by the fact that these indices are not well calibrated @xcite . in more than half of the cases ( 65 per cent ) ,",
    "no further index was removed ( hence all 23 indices were used ) . in 20 , 8 , and 4 per cent of the objects 1 , 2 , and 3 indices",
    "were removed , respectively . in other words , for 97 per cent of all objects , at least 20 indices were included in the fit .    the average errors in log(age ) , metallicity , and [ @xmath2 ] ratio are @xmath21dex , @xmath22dex , and @xmath23dex , respectively .",
    "the error distributions are well approximated by gaussian functions with standard deviations of 0.04 , 0.02 , and @xmath24dex , respectively . finally it should be noted that size of the sdss fibers used for the spectroscopy is relatively large ( 3 arcsec ) .",
    "the stellar population properties discussed here therefore refer to the global stellar populations in the galaxies roughly within or only slightly below the half - light radius . as early - type galaxies are known to have metallicity gradients ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the effect of these when using light - average quantities is that we slightly underestimate the true age of the stellar population , simply because the metal poor halo provides blue light which is interpreted as a slightly younger population .",
    "we expect this effect to be small , though , because the amount of metal - poor stars in luminous red galaxies in sdss is of the order of only a few per cent by mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath2  ratio is not affected by this as early - type galaxies exhibit no significant gradient in @xmath2  within the effective radius @xcite .",
    "note also that no gradient in age is typically found in local early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "we applied further selection criteria to the 16,502 early - type galaxies in our catalogue .",
    "the redshift range sampled ( @xmath7 ) is small and corresponds to a time window of only @xmath25myr .",
    "still , this age difference produces significant selection effects .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaall ] shows the distribution of velocity dispersions for low redshift ( @xmath0 , blue line ) and high redshift ( @xmath26 , red line ) selections in comparison with the entire sample ( grey shaded histogram ) .",
    "it can be seen that despite the small range in redshift , completeness problems at the low-@xmath27 end get worse with the inclusion of higher redshift objects .",
    "this leads to a very bad sampling of the age-@xmath27 relationship , as shown by the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaall ] .",
    "on top of this selection effect in @xmath27 , small evolutionary effects complicate the derivation of stellar population parameters in spite of the small time window sampled @xcite .",
    "we therefore took a conservative approach and decided to consider only the lowest redshift bin ( @xmath0 , blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaall ] ) providing an acceptable coverage in velocity dispersion down to @xmath28 .",
    "this results in a total of 3,360 early - type galaxies .",
    "this redshift range corresponds to a time interval of only @xmath29myr at an average lookback time of @xmath30myr adopting @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33km / s / mpc @xcite .",
    "the characteristic mass of a galaxy population increases with environmental density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that lower density environments host less massive galaxies .",
    "this mass bias has to be eliminated for a meaningful study of the influence of environment .",
    "we therefore investigate the environmental dependence of the correlations of the stellar population properties with velocity dispersion @xmath27 and dynamical galaxy mass @xmath34 . from these stellar population scaling relations we derive formation histories following the method of t05 .",
    "while work on the classical scaling relations of early - type galaxies such as colour - magnitude relation , fundamental plane , and mg-@xmath27 relation has suggested relatively old ages and high formation redshifts already almost two decades ago ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the efforts of the last decade to find correlations between galaxy mass and the three stellar population parameters age , metallicity , and @xmath2  ratio have succeeded only recently .",
    "mostly because of the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the direct determination of luminosity - weighted ages turned out to be extremely difficult . when ages of early - type galaxies were explicitly derived , no evidence for a correlation with mass , luminosity or velocity dispersion was found @xcite . as the most noticeable exception ,",
    "the study of @xcite hints for the presence of an age - sigma relationship , but driven mainly by the lowest - mass objects and with extremely large scatter .    somewhat more convincing correlations with velocity dispersion were found for metallicity and the @xmath2  element abundance ratio in the studies mentioned above . in particular the latter could be further improved ( t05 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) after element abundance ratio sensitive stellar population models were used ( tmb ; * ? ? ?",
    "besides allowing for a quantitative determination of element ratios , the inclusion of element ratio effects allows for a clean definition of total metallicity and in this way helps improving the accuracy of the age determination .",
    "a major obstacle , however , is that most indices depend on all three stellar population parameters .",
    "this leads to tight correlations between the errors of these parameters , which hampers their determination ( t05 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular small data sets are severely affected by this problem .",
    "t05 follow therefore a monte carlo approach and seek correlations between stellar population parameters and galaxy mass through comparison of mock galaxy samples with observational data . through this method , well - defined relationships between all three stellar population parameters ( including luminosity - weighted age ) and galaxy velocity dispersion could be identified . other recent work on extremely large data samples ( mostly sdss ) basically confirm these results @xcite .",

    "note that our density estimator is proportional to the number density per volume but does not have a strictly physical meaning , hence we do not attempt a more accurate identification with astrophysical objects like galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "the top - left and right - hand panels show that the distribution of ages is bimodal with a major peak at old ages ( orange contours ) and a secondary peak at young ages around @xmath35gyr ( cyan contours ) in analogy to red sequence and blue cloud identified in galaxy populations ( see also fig .",

    "this stage is then followed by a rejuvenation phase at redshifts below @xmath3 affecting mostly low- and intermediate mass early - type galaxies , during which the environment must have played a key role possibly via galaxy mergers and interactions .",

    "the most important result is that , at fixed galaxy mass , we find no dependence of the stellar population parameters on environmental density for the bulk of the population .",
    "it is the fraction of rejuvenated ellipticals ( about 10 per cent in the average environment ) , instead , that increases strongly with decreasing environmental density . in the following we compare this finding to other recent work in the literature .    as outlined in the introduction ,",

    "the increase in sample size further implies a higher statistical significance of the results .",
    "a first step toward large samples beyond the very local universe has been done by @xcite who analyse the @xmath78-@xmath27 relationship of a sample of 931 early - type galaxies in various environments .",

    "interesting in the context of this paper is also the work by @xcite based on sdss dr4 .",
    "in essence they find that the typical ages of dwarf galaxies show strong dependence on environment , from being relatively old , passive satellites in clusters to being actively star forming and rejuvenated systems in the field .",
    "this is very well in line with our finding that it is the rejuvenation fraction ( which is largest in the smallest galaxies ) that strongly depends on environment .",
    "colour gradients ( with bluer colours at larger radii ) are found to become steeper with decreasing environmental density @xcite .",
    "combined with the fact that colour gradients are produced by metallicity rather than by age @xcite , this suggests that a higher ( dry ) merger rate in denser environments might have flattened existing metallicity gradients .",
    "however , the results of the present work imply that the formation and evolution of the stellar populations in galaxies must still be controlled intrinsically independent of the environment . such dissipation - less , dry mergers in dense environments",
    "have indeed been observed @xcite .",
    "but they must occur relatively late in the evolutionary history of the early - type galaxy population and must be moderate in number in order to keep the stellar population scaling relations intact . the observationally constrained , modest merger rate for massive galaxies of one merger per galaxy since @xmath5 may be consistent with that requirement @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite have found a residual age - density relationship for red sequence galaxies drawn from sdss , which is in apparent contradiction to the results of this paper and other sdss based stellar population studies such as @xcite .",
    "these two results can be reconciled , however .",
    "it is possible that the actual variation in age as a function of environment is too small for a direct detection in the present work , but visible as the residual age - density relation discussed in @xcite .",
    "this would be consistent with the work of clemens et al ( 2006 , 2009 ) , who find a small ( @xmath79dex ) systematic offset toward older ages in high density ellipticals independently of galaxy mass .",
    "we analyse the stellar population properties of 3,360 early - type galaxies as functions of their environmental density and intrinsic parameters such as velocity dispersion and dynamical mass .",
    "a major aim is to check the result found in t05 by increasing the sample size by more than a factor ten .",

    "the most radical difference with respect to other galaxy samples constructed from sdss is our choice of purely morphological selection .",
    "we have _ visually _ inspected 48,023 objects in the redshift range @xmath7 with @xmath80mag and divided the sample in 31,521 late - type ( spiral arms , clear disc - like structures ) and 16,502 early - type galaxies .",

    "are derived using a minimised @xmath15 technique .",
    "dynamical masses are calculated from a scaling between galaxy velocity dispersion and half - light radius @xcite .",
    "the morphological selection algorithm is critical as it does not bias against recent star formation .",
    "we find that the distribution of ages is bimodal with a major peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around @xmath1gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects .",
    "this is analogue to red sequence and blue cloud identified in galaxy populations usually containing both early and late type galaxies .",
    "the fraction of the young , rejuvenated early - type galaxy population depends on intrinsic galaxy properties as well as their environmental densities , i.e.  it increases as a function of both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasing environmental density .",
    "it varies from only a few per cent for the most massive galaxies in densest regions up to 45 per cent for the smallest early - type galaxies ( a few @xmath48@xmath49 ) in the loosest environments .",
    "this implies that the impact of environment increases with decreasing galaxy mass .",
    "the rejuvenation process detected here through optical absorption line indices may date back or stretch over several gyrs back in time .",
    "most likely an early - type galaxy has been rejuvenated through several minor star formation events each involving star formation of only a few per cent of the galaxy s mass .",
    "most importantly , the rejuvenated galaxies display slightly lower @xmath2  ratios and slightly higher total metallicities .",
    "the former supports the rejuvenation scenario , as a depleted @xmath2  ratio is a clear indication for late type  ia supernova enrichment caused by residual star formation events .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that the emission line spectra of most of the rejuvenated galaxies indicate the presence of minor , ongoing star formation .",
    "some fraction of these are star forming / agn composites .",
    "all objects that host agn in their centres without any star formation being involved have stellar old populations . finally , the higher metallicities suggest that the latter does not involve purely metal - poor pristine gas but must include at least some fraction of previously enriched interstellar medium , either from internal re - processing or accretion .    the early - type galaxy population on the red sequence , instead , turns out to be insensitive to environmental densities .",
    "we find that the stellar population scaling relations including the age - mass relation are independent of the environment and only driven by galaxy mass .",
    "we confirm and statistically strengthen earlier results that luminosity weighted ages , metallicities , and @xmath2  element ratios correlate with velocity dispersion .",
