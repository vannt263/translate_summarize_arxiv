    "quantum mechanics is a very successful physical theory .",
    "it has been revolutionary in many diverse areas , from particle physics to condensed matter and statistical physics , explaining many features of nature in a unified framework .",
    "quantum mechanics has introduced many new concepts to physics .",
    "historically it came into play when max planck first assumed that the energy of the standing waves in a cavity can only take discrete values .",
    "then he could explain the frequency distribution of the black - body - radiation . as in this example",
    ", one of the very first applications of the theory was to make quantities , especially energy , discrete ; from which the theory gets its name .",
    "many other concepts have been introduced by quantum theory . as a second example consider the idea of identical particles and indistinguishability ; this is crucial in many ways to particle statistics in statistical physics .",
    "for instance , one can not track down one electron , among many , and talk about its definite state , an idea which was almost impossible in non - quantum way of thinking .",
    "just to name some other examples from the large list of new concepts due to quantum theory , consider basic and at the same time important notions like spin , tunneling and the peculiar non - locality .",
    "besides new concepts , quantum mechanics has great power in predicting quantitative results ; think of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron .",
    "it can be derived using the formalism of the next revolution , quantum field theory , which was invented because of the need for a relativistic quantum theory .",
    "the agreement between the theory and experiment is astonishing : more than ten decimal places .",
    "nevertheless , over the years several people repeatedly suggested to modify the schrdinger equation , which is the fundamental dynamical law for quantum systems .",
    "one can identify three main reasons to do so .",
    "the first and most widespread reason is the so - called measurement process .",
    "quantum mechanics predicts that there are physical states corresponding to the superposition of two other states .",
    "such superpositions are evident experimentally in the microscopic world , but are absent in our everyday experience of the macro - world .",
    "one does not see anything in a superposition of eigenstates of position like : @xmath0/\\sqrt{2}$ ] .",
    "this is especially important when dealing with macroscopic systems interacting with microscopic ones , i.e.  in measurements : in such cases the dynamics as given by the schrdinger equation immediately predicts the formation of macroscopic superpositions corresponding to two or more possible outcomes of the measurement .    to avoid superposition in macroscopic physics ,",
    "the standard approach is to assume that a collapse of the state vectors takes place @xcite . as a result one has a theory which deals with the physical world in two different ways . at the very fundamental microscopic world",
    "everything evolves according to the schrdinger equation , but at the stage of macroscopic interactions with the micro - world , the wave function collapses .",
    "even the border between these two kinds of evolutions is ambiguously defined .",
    "moreover , the interaction between the measurement apparatus and the system can be tracked down to the fundamental interactions between the particles of the apparatus and the system , which are described by the linear schrdinger equation .",
    "but it is not possible to derive the collapse from such a scheme.@xcite    there are several ways one can get out of this trouble .",
    "one example is _ bohmian mechanics _",
    "@xcite , which essentially does not contain collapse .",
    "despite having a wave function , particles have definite locations in this theory .",
    "a measurement is simply an interaction between the measurement apparatus and the system , without any mystery .",
    "another way out , which is a very natural thing to do , is to modify schrdinger equation in order to have one dynamical evolution both for the micro- and the macro - world .",
    "the new equation should , approximately , correspond to the old schrdinger evolution for microscopic systems , and should yield the collapse of the wave function in the macroscopic domain .",
    "collapse models are examples of these kinds of modifications @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is modified by adding non - linear and stochastic terms to the usual schrdinger equation .    a second motivation for modifying the standard quantum dynamics comes from quantum field theory .",
    "this is a linear theory ( again , the superposition principle ) and it is quite natural to think that this is only the first order approximation of a deeper level non - linear theory .",
    "the paradigmatic example is newtonian gravity , which now we understand as the weak field limit of general relativity .",
    "s. weinberg first suggested such a possibility @xcite .    as a third motivation",
    ", there is the longstanding problem of the unification of quantum and gravitational phenomena . while waiting for a fully consistent and successful unified theory ,",
    "one can write phenomenological equations . one such equations is the so - called schrdinger - newton equation , which is non - linear @xcite .",
    "different parts of the wave function of a system interact among themselves through the newtonian potential .",
    "all these efforts raise an important question : ` are there limits in modifying the schrdinger equation ? '",
    "the answer is yes . as gisin convincingly showed  @xcite , _ whichever way one modifies the schrdinger equation for the wave function , the time evolution for the density matrix has to be linear if one wants to keep no - faster - than - light - signaling . _ here we review this argument with the purpose of giving a pedagogical introduction to the subject .",
    "we work in a standard quantum framework .",
    "the _ states _ of any given physical system are described by the elements @xmath1 of a hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "we want also to give a statistical description of the system , for which it is convenient to use an _ ensemble ( or mixture ) of states .",
    "_ one can identify any such ensemble with a set of state vectors and the corresponding probabilities , i.e.  @xmath3 .",
    "the idea is that the system is in any of such states @xmath4 , but we do not know which one ( classical ignorance ) .",
    "we only know the probabilities @xmath5 for the system to be in the states @xmath4 .",
    "( figure [ ensemble ] )    0.48     ( ) a statistical ensemble , consisting of the states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with probabilities @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "note that the population of the states in the ensemble is proportional to the probabilities .",
    "( ) the same ensemble re - ordered .",
    "the ensemble now consists of two pure sub-ensembles.the second sub - ensemble is populated twice as the first sub - ensemble , and so , the probability of the state @xmath6 is twice as @xmath10 . ]",
    "0.48    the density matrix formalism is the appropriate tool for dealing with statistical mixtures . for a given mixture @xmath3 , the _ density matrix _",
    "is defined as @xmath11 .",
    "a density matrix is _ pure _ if there is only one element in the ensemble ( with probability 1 ) , and is _ mixed _ otherwise .",
    "we name the set of all density matrices as @xmath12 , and the set of pure ones as @xmath13 .",
    "two mixtures @xmath14 and @xmath15 are equivalent if their corresponding density matrices are the same : @xmath16 one can easily see that the equivalence of the mixtures is an equivalence relation .",
    "let us consider a given dynamical evolution for the state vectors of a given system , which in principle has nothing to do with the schrdinger equation ; in particular , it might be non - linear will be shown as @xmath17 , while for a linear operator we will use the notation @xmath18 . note that this will not be done for operators acting on density matrices , these operators in this paper are either linear or just acting on pure states .",
    "moreover , we assume that the evolution of any initial state depends only on the state itself and not on the particular way the state is prepared.@xcite ] : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is given by equation .",
    "so we have the following map defined on the space @xmath13 of pure density matrices from time @xmath21 to time @xmath22 : @xmath23    with the dynamics of pure ensembles known , there remains the question of how _ mixed _ ensembles evolve .",
    "one expects each of the states in the mixed ensemble to evolve according to evolution , and independent of the other states .",
    "( look at figure  [ ensemble_evolve ] ) in other words , different pure sub - ensembles of an ensemble do not interact , i.e.  each one evolves independently according to equation .",
    "therefore a generic density matrix evolves in the following way : @xmath24 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this suggests the possibility of extending the map @xmath25 from the space of pure density matrices to the space of all density matrices : @xmath26 however , in general this is not possible , because two different decompositions of the same initial density matrix @xmath27 may correspond to different density matrices after evolution .",
    "( figure  [ equivalent_ensembles ] ) in other words one density matrix can have different destinies according to the ensemble it is representing .",
    "this means that the map in   is not well defined in general .",
    "0.48    0.48    however , gisin s theorem states that if one wants to rule out the possibility for superluminal communication , different mixtures which are equivalent have to remain equivalent even after the evolution .",
    "so that the map @xmath25 in   can be really extended to the whole set of density matrices as in  .",
    "the theorem will be proved in the next section .",
    "one can also think of stochastic evolutions of the state vectors , which is the case in collapse models , and see what constraints can be put on this type of the evolution .",
    "gisin s theorem immediately generalizes also to such evolutions .",
    "( see appendix  [ a1 ] for details . )",
    "we will be working with finite - dimensional hilbert spaces . that is reasonable , because in case of infinite - dimensional spaces one can always work with a finite - dimensional subspace .",
    "the finite - dimensional hilbert space describing the state vectors of the system we will be working with , is @xmath2 .",
    "we will use un - normalized vectors , which will make our work easier and our results simpler to read .",
    "so we will change notation .",
    "the _ square norm of a vector _ from now on will show its probability in the ensemble , so that instead of the mixture @xmath3 we will be using @xmath28 , and : @xmath29    we will be dealing with the time evolution of two arbitrary but equivalent mixtures @xmath28 and @xmath30 throughout , where @xmath31 ; @xmath32 . because the two ensembles are equivalent we know that one density matrix @xmath33 describes both , i.e.  @xmath34 .",
    "now we have all the ingredients to formulate gisin s argument .    as in a usual bell - type experiment , there are alice and bob , far apart from each other , who make measurements on entangled particles .",
    "we use the hilbert space @xmath2 to describe the states of the particles traveling towards alice s place and use the hilbert space @xmath35 for the ones traveling towards bob s region .",
    "suppose @xmath35 is large enough for the argument to apply .",
    "it can be shown that the following state @xmath36 can be shared between the two parties :       where @xmath28 and @xmath30 are the two equivalent mixtures in @xmath2 that , we started with , upon which alice will make measurements , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are two different orthonormal bases of @xmath35 ( bob s system ) .",
    "the preparation of such a state is possible for any arbitrary choice of the equivalent mixtures @xmath28 and @xmath30 .",
    "( see appendix b for a proof and details . )",
    "suppose an ensemble of states @xmath36 is shared between alice and bob .",
    "bob has two different choices ( among the many ) ; either to measure the observable @xmath40 which has the @xmath41 s as eigenvectors , or to measure the observable @xmath42 which has the @xmath43 s as eigenvectors .",
    "the first type of measurement will prepare the ensemble of states @xmath44 and the second will prepare the ensemble @xmath45 for alice , as a result of the collapse of the state vector .",
    "they correspond to different mixtures , but the density matrix and so all of the expectation values alice can measure are the same .",
    "the two ensembles are equivalent .",
    "( figure  [ alicebob ] ) notice that bob can prepare any equivalent ensemble for alice , by measuring a properly chosen observable , without any need to change the previously shared state respectively .",
    "( look at appendix [ a2 ] ) therefore , this first part of the argument shows that _ different but equivalent mixtures can be prepared at a distance , by using suitable entangled states and measurements .",
    "_    now the crucial point comes .",
    "suppose these two mixtures @xmath28 and @xmath30 , after some time , become inequivalent , because of the dynamics given by eq .  .",
    "then alice can find out the difference between them by making appropriate measurements and computing averages .",
    "therefore she is in the position to understand which observable bob decided to measure , even if bob is arbitrarily far apart .",
    "there is the possibility for superluminal communication , no matter how long it takes for the two mixtures to become appreciably different from each other .",
    "therefore , if we hold on the assumption that there can not be faster - than - light signaling , _ different but equivalent mixtures have to stay equivalent while time passes .",
    "_    the above argument implies that the evolution map @xmath25 defined in   can be extended to the whole space of density matrices as in  , using the rule in  .",
    "_ linearity _ of the map is a consequence of using statistical nature of ensembles , i.e.  pure sub - ensembles evolve independently .",
    "suppose @xmath33 is a convex sum of @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48 if a possible ensemble for @xmath46 is @xmath49 and one for @xmath47 is @xmath50 , then one possible ensemble for @xmath33 will be @xmath51",
    ". the time evolution for @xmath33 is given by ( assuming the extended map  ):      in the fist line , we simply re - wrote @xmath33 in terms of the statistical mixture ; in going from the first to the second line , we used   applied to @xmath33 ; in going from the second to the third line , we used again  , this time applied to the two mixtures @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; in going from the third to the forth line , we use the definition of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in terms of the mixtures defining them .    now that we know that the evolution of the density matrix is linear",
    ", we can make yet further progress by understanding how the state vectors evolve . as is discussed thoroughly in @xcite , the only deterministic evolutions of the state vectors , which induce linear evolutions at the level of density matrices , are the linear unitary evolutions of the state vectors , i.e.   the old schrdinger evolutions of the state vectors .",
    "as @xcite further states , in order to obtain a non - schrdinger evolution at the level of state vectors , consistent with no - signaling , one has to let the state vectors evolve stochastically .",
    "we will talk more about this in the conclusion .",
    "as stated in the introduction there are attempts for modifying the time evolution in quantum mechanics in order to solve the measurement problem .",
    "gisin s argument restricts the possibilities of modifying the evolution equations up to the border of linearity : _ the evolution for the density matrix has to be linear _",
    ", no matter how the state vector s evolution is , e.g.  deterministic , stochastic , etc .    according to the work of g. lindblad @xcite and of v. gorini , a. kossakowsky and e.c.g .",
    "sudarshan @xcite , a linear evolution for the density matrix can be only of the lindblad type , if one adds the two further requirements of a quantum - dynamical - semigroup type of equation , and complete positivity : @xmath55 + \\sum_{k=1}^n\\left(l_k\\rho_tl_k^{\\dagger } - \\frac12 l_k^{\\dagger}l_k\\rho_t - \\frac12 \\rho_tl_k^{\\dagger}l_k\\right).\\ ] ] the first assumption amounts to requiring a markovian evolution , which is a reasonable starting point for writing down a dynamical equation ( all fundamental equations in physics , thus far , are markovian ; non - markovian processes become relevant at the statistical level , when phenomenological equations are the only reasonable way for analyzing a complex system ) .",
    "the second assumption becomes necessary when entangled systems are taken into account .",
    "then , according to @xcite the only possible way to modify the schrdinger equation for the wave function , which leads to a lindblad type of equation for the density matrix , is the way collapse models do it .",
    "therefore , given the above premises , one can conclude that _ the one given by collapse models is the only possible way to modify the schrdinger equation , if one requires no superluminal communication_.      a.b .",

    "we both thank professor vahid karimipour for introducing k.h .  to the research group of a.b .  .",
    "in the case of stochastic evolution of a state vector , initial pure states evolve into mixed mixtures .",
    "think of two identical state vectors present in the ensemble , they will in general evolve into different states .",
    "one can not tell what the future of each state is , but can talk about the statistics of the future of identical copies ; something which can be determined based on the type of the stochastic evolution involved .",
    "( look at figure  [ stochastic_evolution ] ) one expects a pure density matrix @xmath27 to evolve as : @xmath56,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 $ ] denotes the stochastic average and @xmath58 has a degree of randomness , despite the fact that @xmath59 is known .",
    "accordingly , the map in eq .   changes into",
    ": @xmath60        in this appendix",
    "it is shown that a state like the one in can be shared between the two parties : @xmath61 where @xmath28 and @xmath30 are two given equivalent mixtures ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 . ) , and there is no further restriction on them .",
    "let us start at a basic level and prove this via some lemmas .",
    "the lemmas are presented in a similar fashion to the results of @xcite .",
    "[ 3 ] suppose @xmath33 is the density matrix associated to the ensemble @xmath28 , then any single vector @xmath65 can be written as a linear combination of the vectors in the spectral decomposition   of @xmath33 .",
    "take @xmath66 as the spectral decomposition of @xmath33 . if they are a basis , the theorem is trivial",
    ". suppose they are not .",
    "expand the set of @xmath66 to an orthogonal basis of the whole hilbert space by adding @xmath67 to it .",
    "note that this can always be done .",
    "first assume that density matrix of the mixture is @xmath33 , so : @xmath79 equation takes the form : @xmath80 multiplying by @xmath81 we have : @xmath82 then multiplying equation by @xmath83 from left and by @xmath84 from right we have : @xmath85 and by using one immediately gets : @xmath86 conversely suppose and hold",
    ", so we have : @xmath87    consider the columns of @xmath88 ( the matrix having @xmath89 as components , @xmath74 showing the row and @xmath69 the column ) .",
    "they are @xmath90 vectors in @xmath91 . according to   they",
    "are orthonormal and so linearly independent .",
    "so @xmath92 and also the number of columns of @xmath88 is less than or equal to the number of its rows .    we will need a square matrix instead of the possibly rectangular one above . for that",
    ", one can add @xmath93 null vectors to the set of @xmath66 to make them @xmath94 and add columns to @xmath88 to make them an orthonormal basis of @xmath91 ( the columns were already @xmath90 orthonormal vectors , look at  ) .",
    "so the expanded @xmath88 will be an @xmath95 square matrix and we will name it @xmath96 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath96 is unitary  . in the matrix notation we will have : @xmath97 note that @xmath96 acts only on the arrays and is not a hilbert space operator .",
    "@xmath96 can be expanded even more .",
    "in fact , one can make a square matrix of any size satisfying   in this way by adding enough zeros to @xmath4 s and @xmath71 s and adding components to @xmath96 without changing the old ones , and making sure it remains unitary .      [ 14 ] consider two sets of vecotrs @xmath28 and @xmath98 all belonging to the hilbert space @xmath2 and assume that they correspond to the same density matrix , i.e.  @xmath34 .",
    "there will be a hilbert space @xmath35 which has the following property : there is a vector in the tensor product space @xmath99 which can be written in this way : @xmath61 where @xmath41 s are orthonormal and @xmath43 s are orthonormal .",
    "let @xmath66 be the spectral decomposition of the density matrix @xmath33 .",
    "assume @xmath100 without loss of generality .",
    "now as stated before , one can add zeros , if necessary , to the sets of vectors to make the number of members of every set @xmath101 .",
    "so from we have : @xmath102 @xmath96 is unitary , so : latexmath:[\\[\\label{11 }     let @xmath35 be @xmath104 , and let @xmath49 be any orthonormal basis for @xmath35 .",
