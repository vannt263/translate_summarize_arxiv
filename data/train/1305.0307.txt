    "the dynamics of particles of finite inertia suspended in turbulent flows is a fundamental problem with applications ranging from industrial processes ( e.g. spray combustion engines ) to geophysical flows ( e.g. , atmospheric clouds ) .",
    "the interaction between turbulence and particles has been studied to understand rain initiation in warm terrestrial clouds ( e.g. , pinsky & khain 1997 ; falkovich , fouxon , & stepanov 2002 ; shaw 2003 ) , cloud evolution in the atmospheres of planets , cool stars and brown dwarfs ( e.g. , rossow 1978 ; pruppacher & klett 1997 ; freytag et al .",

    "2011 ) and in the interstellar medium ( e.g. , ormel et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the evolution of the particle size depends on the particle collision rate which may be significantly enhanced by turbulent motions in the carrier flow , as illustrated by recent numerical and theoretical advances in this field ( e.g. , wang et al .  2000 ;",

    "an accurate evaluation of the collision rates requires understanding the effects of two interesting phenomena : the preferential concentration or clustering of inertial particles ( e.g. , maxey 1987 and squires & eaton 1991 ) and the turbulence - induced collision velocity . in this work",
    ", we will focus on the statistics of turbulence - induced relative velocities , and briefly discuss the role of turbulent clustering on the collision rate ( see pan et al .",
    "2011 for a detailed discussion of turbulent clustering in the context of planetesimal formation ) .",
    "we restrict our discussion to the relative velocity between same - size particles , usually referred to as the monodisperse case , and will address the general bidisperse case ( collisions between particles of different sizes ) in a follow - up paper .",
    "the main motivation of our study is to improve the modeling of the evolution of dust particles in protoplanetary disks , which sets the stage for the formation of planetesimals , the likely precursors to fully - fledged planets .",
    "for example , the planetesimal formation model by johansen et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 , 2011 ) requires particle growth up to decimeter to meter size , in order to achieve good frictional coupling to the disk rotation and hence the maximum clustering effect by the streaming instability .",
    "cuzzi et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) and chambers ( 2010 ) proposed an alternative model of planetesimal formation based on the strong turbulent clustering of chondrule - size particles .",
    "other studies ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "2010 ) focus on the possibility that small particles settle to the disk midplane , where gravitational instability can result in planetesimal formation ( e.g. goldreich & ward 1973 ; youdin 2011 ) , despite the turbulence stirring caused by the kelvin - helmholtz instability induced by the vertical settling of the particles ( e.g. weidenschilling 1980 ; chiang 2008 ) .",
    "the evolution of the size distribution of dust particles is controlled by collisions .",
    "small particles tend to stick together when colliding , and thus their size grows by coagulation . as the size increases , the particles become less sticky ( blum & wurm 2010 ) , and , depending on the collision velocity , the collisions may result in bouncing or fragmentation .",
    "a detailed summary of experimental results for the dependence of the collision outcome on the particle properties ( such as the particle size and porosity ) and on the collision velocity can be found in guttler et al .",
    "the coagulation , bouncing and fragmentation processes may lead to a quasi - equilibrium distribution of particle sizes ( e.g. , birnstiel et al .",
    "2011 ; zsom et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) . due to the dependence of the collision outcome on the collision velocity ,",
    "an accurate evaluation of the turbulence - induced relative velocity is important for modeling the size distribution of dust particles .",
    "saffman and turner ( 1956 ) studied the relative velocity in the limit of small particles with the particle friction or stopping time , @xmath0 , much smaller than the kolmogorov timescale , @xmath10 , of the turbulent flow .",
    "this limit , known as the saffman - turner limit , is usually expressed as @xmath11 , where the stokes number is defined as @xmath12 .",
    "saffman and turner ( 1956 ) predicted that , at a given distance , @xmath13 , the relative velocity of identical particles is independent of @xmath1 , and , at a given @xmath1 , it scales linearly with @xmath13 for small @xmath13 . in the opposite limit of large particles with @xmath0 larger than the largest timescale of the turbulent flow , abrahamson ( 1975 ) showed that the relative velocity scales with the friction time as @xmath8 .",
    "a variety of models have been developed to bridge the two limits and to predict the relative velocity for particles of any size , i.e. , with @xmath0 covering the entire scale range of the carrier flow ( williams & crane 1983 , yuu 1984 , kruis & kusters 1997 , & alipchenkov 2003 , zaichik et al .",
    "2006 , ayala et al .",
    "2008 ) . among these models ,",
    "the formulation of zaichik and collaborators is particularly impressive , as it examines turbulent clustering and turbulence - induced relative velocity simultaneously .",
    "the model prediction for the relative velocity agrees well with simulation results at low resolutions .",
    "however , the model lacks a transparent physical picture .    pan & padoan ( 2010 ) developed a new model for the relative velocity of inertial particles of any size that provides an insightful physical picture of the problem .",
    "their formulation illustrates that the relative velocity of identical particles is determined by the memory of the flow velocity difference along their trajectories in the past .",
    "the model also shows that the separation of inertial particle pairs backward in time plays an important role in their relative velocity .",
    "the model prediction can correctly reproduce the scaling behaviors of the relative speed in the extreme limits of small and large particles , and was found to successfully match the simulation data of wang et al .",
    "falkovich et al .",
    "( 2002 ) discovered an interesting effect , named the sling effect , which provides an important contribution to the collision rate .",
    "the basic physical picture of this effect is that inertial particles may be shot out of fluid streamlines with high curvature , causing their trajectories to cross with those of other particles ( see fig .  1 of falkovich & pumir 2007 ) .",
    "in particular , in flow regions with large negative velocity gradients , fast particles can catch up with the slower ones from behind .",
    "the trajectory crossing causes the particle velocity to be multi - valued at a given point .",
    "this gives rise to folds , usually referred to as caustics , in the momentum - position phase space of the particles ( wilkinson et al .",
    "2006 ; see fig .  1 of gustavsson & mehlig 2011 for a clear illustration ) .",
    "for small particles with @xmath11 , the sling events correspond to high - order statistics of the flow velocity gradient , and the effect is not reflected in the prediction of saffman and turner ( 1956 ) .",
    "the formulations of falkovich et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and gustavsson & mehlig ( 2011 ) for the collision kernel of @xmath14 particles consist of two contributions . following wilkinson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we name them as continuous and caustic contributions , corresponding to two types of particle pairs with low and high relative velocities , respectively . in the continuous contribution ,",
    "the relative speed follows the saffman - turner prediction and decreases linearly with the particle distance , @xmath13 .",
    "the contribution is amplified by turbulent clustering . however , the scaling exponents of the relative speed and the degree of clustering suggest that the continuous contribution approaches zero in the limit @xmath15 , as pointed out by hubbard ( 2012 ) .",
    "the caustic contribution to the collision kernel per unit cross section was predicted to be independent of the particle size or distance , @xmath13 , and is thus expected to dominate at sufficiently small @xmath13 .",
    "the effect of slings or caustics causes a rapid rise in the collision rate as @xmath1 approaches 1 , which has been proposed to be responsible for the initiation of rain shower in terrestrial clouds ( wilkinson et al .",
    "2006 ) . applying this effect to dust particle collisions in protoplanetary disks",
    ", one may expect that the collision rate greatly accelerates as the particle grows past sub - mm to mm size , corresponding to @xmath16 for typical protoplanetary turbulence conditions .",
    "the recent developments mentioned above have not been considered in coagulation models for dust particles in circumstellar disks .",
    "we will show that the general formulation of the collision kernel commonly used in the astrophysical literature for dust coagulation is inaccurate .",
    "in particular , the dust coagulation models usually adopt collision velocities from the work of volk et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and its later extensions ( e.g. , markiewicz , mizuno & volk 1991 , cuzzi and hogan 2003 , and ormel & cuzzi 2007 ) , which have a number of limitations .",
    "pan & padoan ( 2010 ) pointed out a weakness in the physical picture of these models . roughly speaking , these models assume that the velocities of two particles induced by turbulent eddies with turnover time significantly smaller ( larger ) than @xmath0 are independent ( correlated ) .",
    "as shown by pan & padoan ( 2010 ) , whether the particle velocities contributed by turbulent eddies of a given size are correlated or not also depends on how the eddy size compares to the separation of the particles at the time the eddies were encountered .",
    "therefore , the eddy turnover time is not the only factor that determines the degree of correlation .",
    "the role of the particle separation relative to the eddy size is not captured by the approach of volk et al .",
    "we also find that the model of volk et al .",
    "overestimates the relative velocity by a factor of 2 for particles with @xmath0 on the order of the large eddy turnover time of the turbulent flow .    in this paper , we conduct a @xmath17 numerical simulation to study inertial particle dynamics in a hydrodynamic turbulent flow . in the simulated flow ,",
    "we evolve inertial particles in an extended size range , with @xmath0 covering the entire scale range of the turbulent flow . to our knowledge",
    ", such a systematic simulation of a significant resolution has not been previously conducted in the astrophysical literature . using the simulation data , we first test the model prediction of pan & padoan ( 2010 ) for the rms relative velocity of inertial particles as a function of @xmath1 , and validate the physical picture revealed by the model .",
    "we then apply the pan & padoan ( 2010 ) model to interpret the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the relative velocity .",
    "the pdf study is motivated by the importance of the pdf of the collision speed in modeling dust particle collisions ( windmark et al .",
    "2012 , garaud et al .  2013 ) , which determines the fractions of collisions leading to sticking , bouncing or fragmentation .",
    "the relative velocity pdf of inertial particles has been shown to be highly non - gaussian by numerical , experimental and theoretical studies ( e.g. , sundaram and collins 1997 , wang et al .",
    "2000 , gustavsson et al .  2008 ,",
    "bec et al .",
    "2009 , de jong et al .",
    "2010 , gustavsson & mehlig 2011 , hubbard 2012 ) .",
    "our simulation further confirms high non - gaussianity , which should be incorporated into coagulation models for dust particles in protoplanetary disks .",
    "we will also investigate the particle collision kernel as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "due to the computational cost , the number of particles included in our simulation is limited and only allows to accurately measure the relative velocity statistics at significant particle distances .",
    "the distance range explored is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the kolmogorov scale of the simulated flow .",
    "this raises the question concerning the direct applicability of our measured statistics to dust particle collisions .",
    "the size of dust particles is many orders of magnitudes smaller than the kolmogorov scale ( @xmath20 km ) in protoplanetary turbulence .",
    "therefore , dust particles should be viewed as nearly point particles , and one is required to examine the @xmath15 limit in order to model their collisions ( hubbard 2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "this suggests that the relative velocity measured in our simulation at @xmath21 would be distinct from the collision speed of dust particles , unless the statistics have already converged at @xmath22 .",
    "we find that the measured relative velocity statistics for particles with @xmath23 actually converge at @xmath24 , and are thus directly applicable for the collision velocity of dust particles . on the other hand , for small to intermediate particles with @xmath25 ,",
    "the measured statistics show an @xmath13-dependence in the @xmath13 range explored in this study . for these particles , an appropriate extrapolation to the @xmath15 limit",
    "is needed for applications to dust particle collisions .    in the current paper , we focus on understanding the fundamental physics of turbulence - induced relative velocity at finite distances ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "our theoretical and numerical results provide an important step toward the final goal of estimating the dust particle collision velocity at @xmath27 .",
    "to underhand the @xmath15 limit , we make an initial and preliminary attempt to separate particle pairs into two types , i.e. , continuous and caustic types , which show different scalings with @xmath13 . in particular , we evaluate the contributions of two types of pairs to the collision kernel and examine their behaviors as @xmath28 . a systematical study for the @xmath28 limit",
    "is deferred to a future work . in this work",
    ", we will consider the particle dynamics only in statistically homogeneous and isotropic turbulence .",
    "this is clearly an idealized situation , considering various complexities in protoplanetary disks .",
    "for example , the disk rotation induces large - scale anisotropy , which may have significant effects on the prediction for particles with friction time close to the rotation period .",
    "nevertheless , the idealized problem is a very useful tool to understand the fundamental physics .",
    "we also neglect the vertical settling and radial drift .",
    "these processes do not directly affect the relative velocity between identical particles , although they may provide important contributions for particles of different sizes that we address in a follow - up work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we present a simple model for the rms velocity of a single particle , which provides an illustration for our formulation of the particle relative velocity . in  3 , we introduce the model of pan & padoan ( 2010 ) for the relative velocity of nearby particles .",
    "our simulation setup and the statistical properties of the simulated turbulent flow are described in  4 . ",
    "5 presents simulation results for the one - particle rms velocity . in  6",
    ", we test the model prediction of pan & padoan ( 2010 ) for the rms relative velocity , and discuss in details the probability distribution of the relative velocity as a function of the particle inertia . in  7",
    ", we evaluate the collision kernel .",
    "the conclusions of our study are summarized in  8 .",
    "the dynamics of inertial particles depends crucially on its friction or stopping timescale , @xmath0 . to evaluate of the friction timescale",
    ", we first need to compare the particle size , @xmath29 , with the mean free path of the gas particles in the carrier flow .",
    "if the particle size is larger than the mean free path , the friction timescale is given by the stokes law @xmath30 , where @xmath31 ( @xmath6 g @xmath32 ) is the density of the dust material , @xmath33 is the gas density , and @xmath34 is the kinematic viscosity of the flow . on the other hand , if @xmath29 is smaller than the gas mean free path , the particle is in the epstein regime and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the sound speed in the flow .",
    "for example , for a typical gas density in protoplanetary discs , @xmath37 g @xmath32 , at 1 au , the mean free path of the gas particles is @xmath38 cm , and thus particles with @xmath29 larger ( smaller ) than 1 cm are in the stokes ( epstein ) regime .    the velocity , @xmath39 , of an inertial particle suspended in a turbulent velocity field , @xmath40 , obeys the equation , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the position of the particle at time @xmath43 , and @xmath44 corresponds to the flow velocity  seen \" by the particle .",
    "( [ particlemomentum ] ) has a formal solution , @xmath45 where it is assumed that @xmath46 and the particle has already lost the memory of its initial velocity at @xmath47 .",
    "the formal solution indicates that the velocity of an inertial particle is determined by the memory of the flow velocity along its trajectory within a timescale of @xmath48 in the past .",
    "although the aim of the present work is the relative velocity of inertial particle pairs , we start with a discussion of the single - particle ( or `` 1-particle '' ) velocity induced by turbulent motions .",
    "we provide a simple model for the 1-particle rms velocity as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the derivation of this model helps to illustrate our formulation for the relative velocity between two nearby particles .",

    "furthermore , the 3d variance @xmath148 does not accurately reflect the average collisional energy for each collision .",
    "as pointed out by hubbard ( 2012 ) , a collision - rate weighting is needed to evaluate the average collisional energy per collision .",
    "in particular , @xmath148 is defined as the variance over all particle pairs at a distance , @xmath13 .",
    "but not all the pairs may give a significant contribution to the collision rate in the @xmath27 limit ( see  7.2 ) , and in that case @xmath148 does not provide a reliable estimate for the average collision energy for those pairs that dominate the collision rate at @xmath15 . despite these limitations in the practical use of the overall rms ( or variance ) of the relative speed , its theoretical modeling is an important step toward understanding the fundamental physics . as mentioned earlier , we focus on the monodisperse case with equal - size particles .",

    "the accuracy of the saffman - turner formula for the small particle limit has been questioned , as it neglects the effect of slings and caustic formation ( e.g. , falkovich et al .",
    "2002 , wilkinson et al .",
    "we will test the s - t prediction against our simulation data . in the s - t limit ,",
    "the particle memory is short and the relative speed is determined largely by the local flow velocity at small scales .",

    "we next consider the other extreme limit , i.e. , large particles with @xmath0 much larger than the lagrangian correlation time , @xmath4 , of the flow .",
    "as discussed in  2 , the motions of these particles are similar to brownian motions , and the velocities of any two particles are statistically independent .",
    "this is because the velocity of a large particle has a significant contribution from its memory of the flow velocity long time ago , and the flow velocities  seen \" by the two particles at that time were uncorrelated because the particle separation was likely larger than the flow integral length scale , @xmath108 . with the independence of @xmath170 and @xmath171 , the particle structure tensor defined in eq .",

    "we will show that a key physics for the relative velocity of these particles is their memory of the flow velocity difference in the past and the separation of the particle pair backward in time .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "a variety of models for the particle relative velocity covering the whole range of particle sizes have been developed ( e.g. , volk et al .  1980 ,",

    "the @xmath179 scaling may be obtained by a simple scale - invariant assumption for inertial - range particles ( e.g. , hubbard 2012 ) , which we argue , however , does not provide a sufficient physical picture to understand the full statistics , e.g. , the pdf shape , of the relative velocity .",
    "the models of zaichik and collaborators and pan and padoan ( 2010 ) can reproduce both the s - t limit ( eq .  ( [ saffmanturner ] ) ) and the large particle limit ( eq .  ( [ largelimit ] ) ) .",

    "the physical differences between various models have been summarized in pan and padoan ( 2010 ) .",
    "we review the formulation and the physical picture of the model by pan & padoan ( 2010 ; hereafter pp10 ) for the relative velocity of identical particles . the pp10 model aimed at predicting the variance or rms of the relative velocity . as mentioned earlier , although the rms relative velocity does not directly enter the collision kernel or the average collisional energy per collision , its theoretical modeling is essential for understanding the underlying physics .",
    "for example , the physical picture revealed by the pp10 model is very successful in the interpretation of the probability distribution of the relative velocity (  6.2 ) , which , in turn , is helpful for the evaluation of the collision kernel (  7 ) .",

    "bec et al .  ( 2010 ) also showed that , after a friction timescale , the dispersion of inertial - range particles make a transition to a tracer - like phase , where the separation variance increases as time cubed , a behavior known as the richardson law .",
    "the richardson law was first discovered for tracer pair dispersion at inertial - range scales .",
    "the transition to the richardson phase at a friction timescale or so suggests the ballistic separation for a duration of @xmath0 already brings the average particle distance into the inertial range of the flow .",

    "2006 ; see appendix a ) .",
    "it is thus likely to exist also in the backward separation of inertial particles .",
    "we connect the richardson phase to the ballistic phase at @xmath294 , and use the richardson law @xmath295 at @xmath296 , where @xmath297 is called the richardson constant and @xmath110 is the average dissipation rate of the flow . as the backward separation is typically faster than the forward case , the transition to the richardson phase might occur slightly earlier than assumed here .",
    "bec et al .  (",
    "2010 ) did not report the value of @xmath297 in the richardson phase of inertial particle pair dispersion . as in pp10",
    ", we will take @xmath297 as a parameter . in our model , we use a combined separation behavior that connects a ballistic and a richardson phase at @xmath294 .    the richardson behavior would end when the separation becomes larger than the integral length scale , @xmath108 , of the turbulent flow . at such a large distance , the flow velocities  seen \" by the two particles",
    "is uncorrelated , and the particle separation is expected to be diffusive like in a random walk . it is thus appropriate to switch the richardson behavior to a diffusive phase with @xmath298 at @xmath299 .",

    "this is because the pair separation of these particles does not enter the inertial range of the flow in a friction timescale or so .",
    "therefore , an intermediate phase exists in between the ballistic and richardson phases .",
    "ideally , a three - phase behavior should be considered .",
    "unfortunately , the separation behavior in the intermediate phase is completely unknown , and thus , to include it , one must adopt a pure parameterization . here",
    "we take a simpler approximation : we still connect the richardson behavior directly to the ballistic phase for @xmath306 particles , although it can not be justified physically .",
    "essentially , this parameterizes the later two phases by a single richardson law with a free parameter @xmath297 .",
    "future numerical studies for the entire separation behavior of small particles is needed to improve the approximation . for the particle distance range , @xmath310 , considered in our data analysis ( see  6.1 ) , our model with the assumed behavior",
    "does give acceptable prediction for @xmath311 particles .",
    "however , in the @xmath15 limit , a careful study of the intermediate separation phase of @xmath311 particles is necesary to accurately model their relative velocity .",
    "the problem of using the assumed behavior for particles with @xmath9 is that the richardson phase does not exit .",
    "the velocities of these large particles are uncorrelated even at small distances (  3.1 ) . therefore",
    ", at timescales larger than @xmath0 , the separation is likely diffusive , i.e. , @xmath312 .",
    "realistically , one needs to connect the ballistic phase to a diffusive behavior rather than a richardson law at @xmath313 .",
    "however , it turns out that , at the end of the ballistic phase of these particles , the separation is already @xmath314 . as discussed earlier , once the separation exceeds @xmath108 , the exact separation behavior would not significantly affect the model prediction",
    "this justifies using a combined separation behavior with a ballistic and a richardson phase also for @xmath9 particles .",

    "the measured @xmath297 for tracers in our flow at a limited resolution shows a dependence on @xmath13 , suggesting that the richardson constant for inertial particles may also depend on @xmath13 .",
    "when comparing our model prediction to the simulation results at different @xmath13 , we will adjust @xmath297 to obtain best fits , and examine whether the best - fit values are consistent with the range of @xmath297 measured from tracer particles .",

    "finally , we point out that our model for the rms relative velocity does not directly account for the effect of the spatial clustering of the particles ( see  7 ) .",
    "ideally , a theoretical model needs to consider the clustering and relative velocity statistics simultaneously . at a given time",

    "as @xmath1 increases from 0.1 to 0.4 , the contribution from the particle memory of the flow velocity difference becomes more important , and this contribution tends to reduce the relative speed since the particle distance was smaller in the immediate past .",
