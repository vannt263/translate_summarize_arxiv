    "stellar evolutionary models are critical for interpreting astronomical observations , but they are not well - calibrated for pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars . such calibration requires the measurement of some or all of the fundamental stellar properties : age , mass , radius , luminosity , and effective temperature .",
    "ages are notoriously difficult to estimate ( mamajek & hillenbrand 2008 ; hillenbrand 2009 ) , though they can be inferred indirectly from a membership in a stellar population for which the mean age can be determined .",
    "stellar masses and/or radii require orbital monitoring of eclipsing or visual binary systems . the known pre - main sequence eclipsing binary systems sparsely sample parameter space due to their extreme rarity ( e.g. irwin et al . 2007 ; stassun et al . 2007 ;",
    "stempels et al .",
    "most pms visual binaries have only partial orbits because young stars are distant and any systems which can be spatially resolved necessarily have wide separations and corresponding long periods ( steffen et al .",
    "2001 ; duchne et al .",
    "2006 ) , though a handful of short - period systems are bright enough for interferometric techniques to be feasible ( boden et al .",
    "2005 ; schaefer et al .",
    "in contrast to ages , masses , and radii , the luminosities and temperatures of stars are straightforward to infer from single - epoch observations , so they offer the best near - term prospects for systematic calibration of stellar models .",
    "the procedure can also be inverted : given a star s luminosity and temperature , a theoretical model can be used to estimate its age and mass , plus its radius can be estimated directly from the stefan - boltzmann law .",
    "the standard procedure for calibrating models with luminosities and temperatures is to place two or more nominally coeval stars on an hr diagram .",
    "these stars should trace an empirical isochrone sequence , and this sequence can be compared to theoretical isochrones in order to test their consistency with observations .",
    "hr diagram analysis has provided many crucial insights into models of stellar interiors , atmospheres , and evolution ( e.g. white et al .",
    "1999 ; luhman et al .",
    "there are many systematic astrophysical effects that can complicate this analysis , including unresolved multiplicity , obscuration from circumstellar material ( i.e. an envelope or edge - on disk ) , and veiling from accretion ( at blue optical wavelengths ) or circumstellar disk emission ( at near - infrared wavelengths ) .",
    "these effects can yield ages with errors of an order of magnitude or more , so the samples used in this analysis must be inspected closely to identify stars that might be affected .",
    "additional physics , such as stellar activity or convection efficiency , could also play a role ( chabrier et al .",
    "2007 ; stassun et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the inverse procedure plays an important role in the study of binary systems ( e.g. hartigan et al .",
    "1994 ; white & ghez 2001 ; hartigan & kenyon 2003 ) .",
    "it is commonly assumed that multiple star formation proceeds almost simultaneously , such that all stars in a bound multiple system are coeval .",
    "however , this assumption can be tested only by using the evolutionary models that require calibration , so any apparent disagreement between binary component ages could be due to non - coevality or errors in the models .",
    "emerging evidence from several young eclipsing binary systems shows that their component properties are inconsistent with any single age predicted by pre - main sequence evolutionary models ( e.g. stassun et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) , but the frequency and degree of implied noncoevality is still unclear .    in this paper , we estimate the ages of a large sample of stringently vetted young binary systems in the taurus association ( @xmath51 - 2 myr ; @xmath6145 pc ) in order to test the system components relative coevality and the validity of theoretical isochrones in matching empirical hr diagram sequences . in section 2",
    ", we describe our sample of binary systems , and in section 3 , we describe the stellar models and analysis techniques used to infer stellar ages . in section 4 , we show an hr diagram with all our sample members and identify likely contaminants . in section 5",
    ", we test the coevality of young binary systems by adopting model - predicted ages .",
    "finally , in two appendices , we test the evolutionary models using a large sample of likely single stars and using a subset of high - order multiple systems .",
    "the accurate determination of stellar parameters requires spatially- and/or spectrally - resolved observations that are not polluted by light from companions ; our sample is comprised of all known taurus binary systems that have spectral types and flux ratios for at least two components . at the distance of taurus ( @xmath4145 pc ) , most binary systems with separations of",
    "@xmath7100200 au can not be resolved in seeing - limited observations with typical resolutions of @xmath41 . given this limit , most sample members",
    "have been observed with hst , ground - based adaptive optics , or echelle spectrographs ( distinguishing the components spectra and relative fluxes ) .",
    "high - order multiplicity can give the appearance of non - coevality , so we immediately omitted any binary pairs which contained an additional component without its own measured spectral type and flux .",
    "as we describe in section 4 , we also cut additional targets from this sample if they appeared to be affected by other systematic uncertainties .",
    "we list the observed properties of our sample members in table 1 , along with the references used to infer spectral types , extinctions , and fluxes . given the ad hoc nature of our sample ,",
    "it is not complete and may be subject to biases , but the goal of our initial sample selection was to be as inclusive as possible .    the wide components that could be resolved in seeing - limited observations were drawn from the sample studied in our previous wide multiplicity survey ( kraus & hillenbrand 2007a , 2009 ) .",
    "most of these stars had already been identified as taurus members , so we drew their observed properties from previous work by kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) , duchne et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , white & basri ( 2003 ) , white & hillenbrand ( 2004 ) , and luhman ( 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "all of these authors reported spectral types and extinctions , and we adopted nir magnitudes from the 2mass point source catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) or from our own psf fitting photometry of 2mass atlas images ( kraus & hillenbrand 2007a ) .",
    "the 2mass photometry for rw aur ab and most of the duchne et al .",
    "sample was unreliable since the system separations fell near the 2mass resolution limits , so we adopted total @xmath8 fluxes from 2mass and the @xmath8 band flux ratios reported by white & ghez ( 2001 ) or correia et al .",
    "we adopted an outer separation limit of 30 for identifying binary pairs .",
    "the binary population probably dominates among all pairs extending out to @xmath42 ( kraus & hillenbrand 2008 ) , but the frequency of chance alignments between unbound stars becomes significant at @xmath930 .",
    "the closer systems that could be resolved with high - resolution imaging were drawn from several recent spectroscopic surveys .",
    "most of the spectroscopic observations were obtained with hst / stis by hartigan & kenyon ( 2003 ) , but several systems were observed under good seeing by duchne et al .",
    "individual systems were also studied by white et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with hst / fos , or in our own survey of low - mass multiplicity with keck laser guide star ao ( lgsao ; kraus et al .",
    ", in prep ) . as before , we inferred nir magnitudes from the total system fluxes reported in 2mass and spatially resolved flux ratios reported by leinert et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , white & ghez ( 2001 ) , correia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and our lgsao survey .",
    "there are a small number of double - lined spectroscopic binaries that have been identified and studied in some detail in taurus .",
    "we have added the well - known system uz tau aab to our sample , adopting the spectral types and inferred h band flux ratio found by prato et al .",
    ". we also added the short - period spectroscopic binary v773 tau aab , which was studied with rv and interferometric monitoring by boden et al .",
    "( 2007 ) as part of an orbit monitoring program .",
    "the v773 tau system also includes two faint companions at small separations and a wide brown dwarf companion ; we do not include the close companions because they do not have spectral type determinations and because they are too faint to influence the observed properties of v773 tau aab ( duchne et al .",
    "2003 ) , but we include the wide substellar companion ( luhman et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we also considered whether to include v826 tau ( massarotti et al .",
    "2005 ) and dq tau ( mathieu et al . 1997 ) , but the only known flux ratio for v826 tau is in the optical and there are no flux ratios reported for dq tau , so these systems could not be integrated with the rest of our sample .",
    "we also note that one binary system in our sample , xz tau , was recently suggested to be a possible hierarchical triple based on resolved radio observations of xz tau b at 1.3 cm and 7 mm .",
    "we have retained this system in our sample because the companion was not identified with hst ( krist et al .",
    "2008 ) or in other surveys , but the suggested separation ( @xmath490 mas or 13 au ) was near the detection limits of the earlier observations , so we regard it as a credible possibility . as we will show later , xz tau b is overluminous compared to xz tau a or hl tau , which supports its probable multiplicity .    finally ,",
    "most of the binary components in our sample have spatially resolved photometry in the @xmath8 filter only . inferring the component luminosities from such a red bandpass",
    "might introduce systematic errors in our estimated luminosities due to near - infrared excesses from circumstellar disks . in order to address this prospect , we have searched the literature to determine which stars are likely to host a warm disk ; we summarize our assessments and the corresponding references in table 1 .",
    "we based these assessments , in order of priority , on 3 - 10 @xmath10 m photometry ( from spitzer / irac or ground - based ao imaging ) , optical spectroscopic accretion signatures , 10 - 30 @xmath10 m spectroscopy ( from spitzer / irs ) , and finally on submm / mm photometry . in each case where sufficient data is available ,",
    "we have concluded that the star either has a disk ( `` y '' ) , does not have a disk ( `` n '' ) , or might have a disk ( but the observations are nt spatially resolved , so we ca nt determine which binary component(s ) have one ; `` y ? '' ) .",
    "we will address the significance of flux excesses from warm dust in section 5 .",
    "any comparison of observations to stellar evolutionary models requires the conversion of observed properties ( spectral types , filtered magnitudes , and extinctions ) into fundamental physical parameters ( effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities ) .",
    "this process is accomplished by invoking a temperature scale , a set of bolometric corrections , a reddening law , and an estimated distance .",
    "temperature scales directly relate spectral types to temperatures , allowing the estimation of temperatures based on observed spectral features .",
    "temperatures are also used to define intrinsic colors , from which an observed color can be used to infer the reddening and extinction .",
    "bolometric corrections are temperature - dependent ratios of the flux in a filtered band to the full bolometric flux and are calibrated for nearby field stars that have been studied across the full range of wavelengths with significant contribution to the luminosity .",
    "once the bolometric flux is known , the distance for a star then directly yields the bolometric luminosity",
    ".    observed spectral types can be converted into effective temperatures using an adopted temperature scale , but this process is somewhat uncertain for young stars since the relation between temperature and spectral type is sensitive to surface gravity . for m - type stars , a giant with a given spectral type can be @xmath4300 k warmer than a dwarf of the same type ( e.g. leggett et al .",
    "1996 versus perrin et al . 1998 ; richichi et al . 1998 ; van belle et al .",
    "young stars have intermediate surface gravity , so it has been suggested ( e.g. luhman 1997 ; luhman et al .",
    "2003 ) that an intermediate temperature scale might be appropriate .",
    "for example , luhman et al . (",
    "2003 ) found that m2-m5 stars in ic 348 have bluer @xmath11 colors than their field counterparts , matching the trend seen for giants .",
    "similarly , we have shown in a previous publication ( kraus et al .",
    "2006 ) that the @xmath12 colors of m5-m9 stars in taurus and upper sco are significantly bluer than those of field dwarfs , though not as blue as for giants .",
    "conversely , more recent surveys of moderately older stars in @xmath13 cha and @xmath14 cha by lyo et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2008 ) show that the broadband colors and temperature - sensitive narrowband spectral indices are generally similar to field dwarfs to spectral types as late as m5.5 , with only a mild discrepancy in the @xmath15 color that could be attributed to chromospheric activity .",
    "we have adopted the temperature scale suggested by luhman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for use in low - gravity young stars . for spectral types @xmath7m0",
    ", the temperature - spt relation does not appear to be gravity - sensitive , so luhman et al .",
    "use the temperature scale of schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) .",
    "for late - type ( @xmath16m0 ) young stars , luhman et al .",
    "define an intermediate temperature scale that makes the average cluster sequences of taurus and ic348 internally coeval with respect to the nextgen models ( baraffe et al .",
    "unfortunately , this calibration introduces an element of circularity into our analysis ; the temperature scale is chosen by definition to make our chosen models reproduce observations .",
    "it is unclear whether the temperature scale of young stars is truly different or the adopted temperature scale is correcting for a discrepancy in the model , so our results should be weighed accordingly . the difference in inferred temperatures with respect to field m dwarf values ( leggett et al .",
    "1996 ) is @xmath450 k at m3 , @xmath4100 k at m5 , and @xmath4200 k at m8 , equivalent to a systematic uncertainty of @xmath170.25 , @xmath170.5 , and @xmath170.75 subclass , respectively .",
    "we have adopted the bolometric corrections that we previously described for use with field stars ( kraus & hillenbrand 2007b ) . for spectral types @xmath7k7 , we used the corrections suggested by masana et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , while for m dwarfs , we used the corrections of leggett et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and leggett et al .",
    "values calibrated for field dwarfs might be systematically inaccurate if the bolometric correction is also gravity - sensitive , so it would be helpful to verify whether these bolometric corrections are valid for young stars .",
    "however , we are not aware of any such tests having been attempted . in all cases , we have adopted the observed nir flux ( and its bolometric correction ) which is closest to the @xmath18 filter . as we describe below",
    ", luminosity excesses are typically least significant in the @xmath19 and @xmath18 filters , but most of the binary systems in our sample have resolved flux measurements only in the @xmath20 or @xmath8 filters .    we have implemented our extinction corrections using the interstellar reddening law of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which stipulates that one magnitude of visual extinction corresponds to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ; these values are consistent with the interstellar reddening law in the 2mass filters suggested by indebetouw et al .",
    "reddening laws might vary in regions with extremely high density ( weingartner & draine 2001 ; romn - ziga et al .",
    "2007 ) , but most of our sample members are only moderately reddened .",
    "analysis of 2mass source counts and colors toward the ophiuchus , lupus , and pipe nebulae suggest that the standard interstellar reddening law is appropriate to extinctions of @xmath24@xmath420 or more ( lombardi et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we adopted a characteristic distance for all taurus members of 145@xmath1715 pc .",
    "recent high - precision parallax measurements with the vlba ( lestrade et al .",
    "1999 ; loinard et al .",
    "2007 ; torres et al . 2007 ; loinard et al .",
    "2008 ) suggest that there might be a distance gradient of 165 - 125 pc in the east - west direction , though the discrepant distances of neighboring v773 tau and hubble 4 ( 148@xmath175 pc versus 132.5@xmath170.6 pc ) suggest an overall scatter at any location of @xmath410 - 15 pc ( 10% ) .",
    "the luminosity uncertainty if we adopt the characteristic distance is only @xmath40.1 - 0.2 mag , which is similar to the uncertainty from dereddening and intrinsic variability , so attempting to extrapolating more precise distances from this suggestion of 3d structure is not likely to improve our results .    we should note that there is room for significant uncertainty in our inferred luminosities due to the intrinsic variability of young stars .",
    "variability in class iii stars should be caused by cool spots , so its characteristic amplitude at near - infrared wavelengths should be no more than @xmath40.1 mag ( e.g. carpenter et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "however , the same survey showed that class i - ii stars occasionally vary by as much as 1 - 2 mag in the near infrared , and extreme classes of stars ( such as fuor and exor stars ) can vary by even more .",
    "this suggests that an unusually young apparent age for one binary component could be the result of variability in that component .",
    "a star that is surrounded by circumstellar material could also appear systematically underluminous by several magnitudes if it possesses an edge - on disk or a massive circumstellar envelope that renders it visisble only in scattered light .",
    "it would then appear much older than its unobscured companion .",
    "one such case is hk tau b ; both components of this system have a spectral type of m1 ( white & hillenbrand 2004 ) , but the b component is 3.3 magnitudes fainter in @xmath8 .",
    "finally , the presence of veiling due to accretion ( at blue wavelengths ) or circumstellar dust emission ( at red wavelengths ) could bias the inferred luminosity of a binary component .",
    "observations in the @xmath19 or @xmath18 filter are least sensitive to this veiling , though even those measurements can be significantly impacted ( folha & emerson 1999 ; white & hillenbrand 2004 ) . in our study , we have used photometry from @xmath18 or from the nearest redder filter . we would prefer to use @xmath18 for all systems , but in most cases , the absence of suitable data forces us to use relative photometry in @xmath20 or @xmath8 . data from bluer filters is also available for some sample members , but these data are not as homogeneous and we prefer to minimize the total wavelength range over which we make our luminosity estimates .",
    "we list the stellar properties that we inferred with these methods in table 1 .",
    "our temperature uncertainties have been determined from the uncertainty in each star s spectral type .",
    "each of the bolometric magnitude uncertainties listed above should contribute @xmath40.1 mag , so we have adopted a total statistical uncertainty of 0.3 mag .",
    "however , many of the uncertainties ( such as for distance and extinction ) should be correlated between binary components , so the uncertainty in their relative ages should be lower than our formal estimates . as we discuss further in section 5 , there is compelling evidence that the scatter in relative ages of binary components is indeed significantly smaller , suggesting that these error estimates are conservative .",
    "several sets of pre - main sequence evolutionary models have been developed in recent decades , but all of these models still face significant challenges in confronting observational constraints .",
    "hillenbrand & white ( 2004 ) found that all models have difficulty matching the dynamical masses of young stars with @xmath251.2 @xmath26 , a range which encompasses almost all of our sample .",
    "however , the lyon models ( baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ; chabrier et al .",
    "2000 ) seem to work best for low - mass stars , especially when using a mixing length of @xmath27@xmath28 and the revised temperature scale of luhman et al .",
    "all models were found to reproduce the observed masses for stars with @xmath291.2 @xmath26 , though the lyon models only extend to 1.4 @xmath26 .    in light of these results ,",
    "we have adopted a hybrid combination of the lyon models for low - mass stars and the models of dantona and mazzitelli ( 1997 ; dm97 ) for higher - mass stars .",
    "for masses @xmath300.5 @xmath26 , we use the mass - luminosity - temperature relations of the lyon models with a mixing length of @xmath27@xmath28 . for masses",
    "@xmath311.0 @xmath26 , we use the corresponding relations of dm97 . finally , in the intermediate regime of 0.6 - 0.9 @xmath26 , we adopt a weighted average of the luminosity and temperature predicted by each model in order to produce a smooth transition between the two sets of models .",
    "this choice does not provide any insight into the missing physics that are still required to bring the models into agreement , but it represents an acceptable compromise for estimating relative ages of a sample of young stars .",
    "the two sets of models converge at older ages , so our solution is only important for very young stars ( @xmath710 myr ) .",
    "these models report stellar luminosities and temperatures at quantized values of age and mass , so for each of our sample members , we have linearly interpolated between the four values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 around it in the hr diagram .",
    "the lyon models also face a significant challenge with respect to very young stars since they are not defined for ages of @xmath341 myr , so for each star that falls above this isochrone and has a mass within the affected range ( @xmath341 @xmath26 ) , we have linearly extrapolated its age from the four points below it in the hr diagram .",
    "these extrapolated ages should be regarded as much more uncertain than older ages , but the degree of error should be similar for stars with similar hr diagram positions , so only systems with disparate masses will be subject to the full systematic uncertainty .    in table 2 , we list the inferred mass and age for each star from our hybrid system and from the default lyon and dm97 models .",
    "several sample members illustrate the extreme difference in mass and age estimates for the two sets of models .",
    "for example , the inferred parameters of hn tau a are @xmath351.35 @xmath26 and @xmath366.85 according to the lyon models and @xmath350.65 @xmath26 and @xmath366.05 according to the dm97 models ; our hybrid isochrones yield @xmath350.85 @xmath26 and @xmath366.27 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath37 due to observational errors is @xmath170.25 dex for an average star in our sample , but as we describe below , this uncertainty could be an overestimate since binary systems appear to be more coeval .",
    "the overall population sequence in an hr diagram provides a valuable test of our choice of evolutionary models .",
    "if the association is nominally coeval , then it should trace a single recognizable sequence that is parallel to theoretical isochrones .",
    "individual sample members that strongly deviate from the association sequence should also be examined for a systematic source of error such as erroneous membership , circumstellar material that blocks and scatters the stellar flux , or misclassification of spectral types .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the hr diagram for all of our binary sample members .",
    "the cluster sequence seems to trace the 1 - 2 myr isochrone , albeit with significant scatter due to the many sources of uncertainty and the unknown spread of stellar ages .",
    "we adopted the two sets of theoretical isochrones ( lyon for low - mass stars and dm97 for higher - mass stars ) specifically because they fit the taurus single - star sequence across the full mass range of our sample ( appendix a ) , so this agreement with the canonical age of taurus is not surprising .",
    "however , many individual members fall unusually low ; as we show in figure a2 for single stars , the 5 myr isochrone represents a + 2@xmath2 deviation from the median age of taurus , so we adopt this approximate lower limit for the observed scatter of the main body of members . most of the binary components below this isochrone are known to be anomalous .",
    "the warmest anomalous members ( hbc 352 - 357 ) have been classified as taurus members for several decades ( e.g. walter et al .",
    "1988 ; herbig & bell 1988 ; kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) based on their x - ray emission and ( for hbc 352 - 355 ) their radial velocities .",
    "however , these stars are located at the far western edge of taurus , well away from the central cloud cores , and their underluminosity has been recognized since their discovery .",
    "few membership surveys have extended so far in this direction from the clouds , so it is unknown whether these stars are surrounded by a more extensive coeval population .",
    "given their proximity in projection to the perseus complex , it seems plausible that they are associated with that more distant , but similarly young population .",
    "since both members of each binary pair seem to be equally anomalous , this seems to be a reasonable explanation for their low positions on the hr diagram ; we therefore choose to remove them from our sample for all subsequent analysis .",
    "three of the other binary companions are known sources seen only in scattered light due to the presence of an edge - on circumstellar disk .",
    "stapelfeldt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used hst and ao observations to show that the optical and nir flux from hk tau b comes from extended nebulosity , with no recognizable flux coming directly from the central star .",
    "krist et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and krist et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found similar results from hst imaging of hl tau and haro 6 - 5b , respectively .",
    "hk tau and haro 6 - 5b appear significantly underluminous in our hr diagram since this reflected light only represents a small fraction of each star s total emitted flux .",
    "surprisingly , hl tau does not appear underluminous , which suggests that its luminosity might be dominated by scattered light in the optical and direct flux from the central star in the @xmath18 band .",
    "however , we have chosen conservatively to omit all three companions from our analysis of relative binary ages .",
    "the binary component haro 6 - 28 a sits just below the 5 myr isochrone , so further analysis of its scattered - light properties might be worthwhile in the future .",
    "however , its companion haro 6 - 28 b sits just above the 5 myr isochrone , so the inferred ages of the two components are mutually consistent . barring a systematic uncertainty for the binary system , this consistency suggests that haro 6 - 28 ab is genuinely one of the oldest systems in taurus .",
    "haro 6 - 28 was originally identified as an h@xmath27 emission line star ( haro et al .",
    "1953 ; cohen & kuhi 1979 ) and at least one component has a 1.3 mm excess indicative of a disk , so its youth seems secure.5% ) for @xmath40.3 - 0.5 @xmath26 stars by the age of @xmath45 myr , though not as rare as for higher - mass stars . ]    finally , two companions ( v710 tau c and 2m04554801 ) sit below the 5 myr isochrone without any obvious explanation .",
    "their optical spectra appear to be accurately classified ( luhman 2004 ; kraus & hillenbrand 2009 ) , so a large error in temperature seems unlikely .",
    "they are associated with stars that appear youthful , so membership in a different population also does not explain their anomalously old apparent ages .",
    "v710 tau c has not been observed at high spatial resolution , but it shows a very significant k band excess in 2mass ( @xmath382.2 ) , so it might possess an edge - on circumstellar disk .",
    "2m04554801 appears to be a point source in @xmath8 band imaging with keck lgsao ( kraus & hillenbrand , in preparation ) , so if the star is seen in scattered light in the near - infrared , then the scattering region must be smaller than for other sources with edge - on disks .",
    "the original discovery spectrum shows obvious signatures of youth ( k. luhman , priv . comm . ) , and the optical / nir sed does not show any of the characteristic signs of an edge - on disk , so the explanation for its underluminosity is currently unknown .",
    "we can not justify removing either star from our sample , but both systems should be regarded with appropriate skepticism .    in the following analysis , we will omit all of the hbc sources that have questionable membership",
    ". we will retain haro 6 - 5b and hl tau for a more in - depth study of high - order multiple systems , but will omit all three confirmed scattered light systems for testing coevality",
    ". we will retain haro 6 - 28 a , v710 tau c , and 2m04554801 since there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that they suffer a systematic bias .",
    "the first step of our analysis is to determine whether binary systems appear more coeval than the association as a whole .",
    "the timescale for star formation across an entire region could be as long as 10 myr ( mouschovias 1976 ; shu 1977 ) , while the formation of a single star system should proceed on the dynamical timescale of @xmath40.1 - 0.2 myr ( shu et al .",
    "an upper limit on the non - coevality of binary systems will provide a direct constraint on the formation timescale for binary systems with respect to the entire association .    in figure 2 ( top ) , we show the same hr diagram as figure 1 , minus the objects we eliminated in the discussion above , where each of the binary pairs is connected by a line .",
    "the overall trend for binary pairs is to define lines that roughly parallel the theoretical isochrones , which is expected since the models have been chosen by comparison to the taurus single - star sequence .",
    "however , as we determine quantitatively below , some pairs fall on significantly different isochrones .",
    "this type of plot provides a summary of the underlying data , but it is hard to draw any firm conclusions regarding overall coevality or possible dependence of coevality on binary parameters .",
    "more detailed statistical analysis must be pursued using the inferred stellar ages , as has been concluded by past studies of binary ages ( e.g hartigan et al .",
    "1994 ; white & ghez 2001 ; hartigan & kenyon 2003 ) .    in figure 3 ( top )",
    ", we show a histogram of the absolute difference in the inferred logarithmic age , @xmath39 , for each of our binary pairs .",
    "the rms scatter in @xmath40 among our sample is 0.40 dex and should encompass all observational uncertainties as well as any intrinsic age spread for binary pairs .",
    "most of the model - predicted masses fall in the range @xmath41 @xmath26 , with some masses extending as high as 1.5 @xmath26 and as low as 0.03 @xmath26 .",
    "we have compared the scatter in binary component ages to that of the overall taurus population by using a bootstrap monte carlo routine to simulate 10,000 populations where we pair each primary with another randomly - selected secondary . in figure 3 ( bottom )",
    ", we show the distribution of all rms scatter measurements for these simulated pairs ; only 14 realizations of our simulation ( @xmath40.15% ) have rms scatter of 0.40 dex or less , indicating that binaries are more coeval than the overall taurus population at a significance of @xmath43@xmath2 .",
    "the typical age differences for binary systems and for random pairs are similar to those measured by white & ghez ( 2001 ) ; they used a similar sample , but estimated effective temperatures using dereddened @xmath12 photometry instead of spectral types .",
    "as we describe in section 3 , the observational uncertainties for our sample allow us to estimate the corresponding uncertainty in each binary component s age , and thus in the degree of coevality .",
    "these estimated uncertainties vary significantly across our sample , but the median , mean , and quadratic mean of these uncertainties ( 0.33 , 0.42 , and 0.48 dex in measured @xmath0@xmath42 , respectively ) are all similar to the standard deviation for our sample .",
    "this strongly suggests that much of the total error budget is dominated by observational errors , and therefore that model - related errors and the true dispersion in relative ages for binary components are both @xmath430.40 dex .",
    "however , we must also consider whether a single distribution is adequate for describing all binary systems , as there are several effects that could bias one binary component s age by a significant amount ( including overluminosity due to unresolved additional multiplicity or underluminosity because an object is seen in scattered light ) .",
    "we could expect a narrow distribution centered close to zero and broadened by the observational errors ( corresponding to unaffected binary systems ) plus a secondary peak away from zero ( for systems affected by unusual phenomena such as those mentioned above ) .",
    "the observed distribution seems to match this expectation , with most systems concentrated at @xmath0@xmath1@xmath340.3 dex and an extended tail at @xmath0@xmath1@xmath160.5 dex .",
    "if we omit the extended tail and compute the standard deviation of the binary age dispersion for only systems with @xmath0@xmath42@xmath340.4 dex , we find a dispersion of @xmath2@xmath3@xmath40.16 dex , corresponding to a typical factor of 1.5 in relative age .",
    "this dispersion is actually lower than the typical uncertainties we estimated above for @xmath44 , which suggests that we might have been too conservative in estimating observational uncertainties .",
    "the extended tail includes one sample member that we suggested to be a candidate edge - on disk ( v710 tau c ) based on its underluminosity and extremely red @xmath45 color .",
    "the tail also includes two possible hierarchical triple systems , dk tau and xz tau , which were suggested to be possible hierarchical triples by jensen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and carrasco - gonzalez et al .",
    "polarization measurements by jensen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) indicate that the component disks in dk tau ab are misaligned , unlike most other double - disk systems in taurus .",
    "radio observations by carrasco - gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) show that xz tau b has a double - peaked distribution that could result from a @xmath413 au binary companion .    in light of this",
    "possible bimodality , it is worthwhile to return to figure 2 and plot only the `` coeval '' sample ( @xmath0@xmath1@xmath340.4 dex ; center ) and the `` non - coeval '' sample ( @xmath0@xmath1@xmath90.4 dex ; right ) .",
    "this division reveals a startling trend ; among the `` non - coeval '' subsample , 11 of the 12 systems have a significantly younger primary star .",
    "as we show in appendix a , the model - derived ages in this mass range do not show a mass - dependent trend , so the tendency for some binary primaries to appear younger must be either a genuine result of the formation process or a result of binary - specific systematic uncertainties . given the clear discrepancy with respect to the apparently coeval majority of our sample , we strongly suspect that systematic errors are to blame .",
    "the fraction of apparently coeval binary systems in our sample ( 24/36 ) is identical to the fraction identified by the survey of hartigan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in a sample of binary systems in taurus and orion ( which included many taurus binaries that we have rejected as hierarchical multiples )",
    ", they found that 17/26 had @xmath46@xmath47@xmath340.24 dex , corresponding roughly to @xmath0@xmath1@xmath70.4 dex . on its face",
    ", this result suggests that all of the improvements in evolutionary models , spectral type assessments , and multiplicity surveys in the past 15 years have only served to cut the standard deviation in @xmath0@xmath42 for coeval systems from 0.23 dex to 0.16 dex .",
    "however , there is one significant difference .",
    "all of our non - coeval systems possess apparently younger primaries , while all of the corresponding systems in the hartigan et al .",
    "sample possess apparently older primaries .",
    "there is little overlap between our samples since many wide taurus binaries have since been discovered to be hierarchical multiples , so one possible explanation is that our stringent multiplicity vetting simply allows another systematic error to dominate .",
    "there are three likely culprits for the systematic error that makes some systems appear non - coeval .",
    "first , the non - coevality could result from unrecognized high - order multiplicity .",
    "the binary fraction is higher among solar - type stars than lower - mass stars ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; fischer & marcy 1992 ) .",
    "if this trend also applies to the fragmentation of binary components into high - order multiples , then we might expect more binary primaries to be unresolved pairs ( which would then appear to be a single overluminous star ) .",
    "an overluminosity by 0.75 mag ( denoting an equal - mass binary pair ) should correspond to an apparent age discrepancy of @xmath40.5 dex , which matches the observed trend .",
    "however , our sample includes many objects with similar temperatures ( and thus presumably similar masses ) , and as we will show in a future paper ( kraus & hillenbrand , in preparation ) , the frequency of binaries at separations @xmath750100 au in taurus is nearly constant for all masses @xmath160.3 @xmath26 .",
    "we might expect a significant excess of apparently younger primary stars if the secondary masses fell significantly below this limit , but few of our targets do .",
    "the other two possible explanations are tied to the properties of circumstellar disks .",
    "surveys of protoplanetary disks in binary systems have suggested that disks might be more likely to form or persist around the primary than the secondary ( e.g. monin et al .",
    "2007 ) , even though lower - mass stars generally retain their disks longer ( e.g. carpenter et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we determined most stellar luminosities from the @xmath8 band flux , so a disk excess could have led to significant overestimation of those luminosities . in addition , the disks of high - mass stars boast more substantial nir excesses than those of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ( e.g. meyer et al .",
    "1997 versus liu et al .",
    "2003 ) , so the magnitude of the luminosity overestimate should also be larger for primaries than secondaries .",
    "all of these explanations should be investigated and ruled out before an astrophysical explanation is considered .",
    "in particular , systematic effects from disks should be mitigated by estimating stellar luminosities using the least contaminated filter ( @xmath18 ) and by modeling the circumstellar dust emission using @xmath48 photometry so that any remaining excess can be subtracted .",
    "however , our preliminary disk census suggests that nir excess contamination might play only a modest role in biasing relative binary ages ( unless the disk directly obscures the central star , making it appear in scattered light ; section 4 ) .",
    "of the 24 pairs which appear coeval , 20 have at least one disk ( where @xmath314 are mixed pairs and @xmath3111 are double - disk systems ) .",
    "this presents little contrast to the 12 apparently non - coeval pairs , of which nine have at least one disk ( with 3 mixed pairs and 6 double - disk systems ) .",
    "the similar and nontrivial fractions of mixed pairs are difficult to explain if disk biases dominate , though double - disk systems could appear coeval if both binary components luminosities are biased upward by the same amount .      the detailed physics of multiple star formation",
    "are still poorly understood , so any apparent trends in the coevality of binary systems could yield valuable new constraints on theoretical models .",
    "a third of the systems in our sample appear non - coeval , so any such trend could be identified among the 12 non - coeval binary pairs .",
    "the three binary properties that we can test against system coevality are the component mass ratio , the total system mass , and the system projected separation .",
    "the degree of coevality as a function of separation across the entire association could also constrain the large - scale star formation processes , so we also analyze the coevality as a function of separation between all pairs of stars in our sample .    in figure 4 , we plot the difference in system age @xmath0@xmath1 as a function of binary mass ratio . if binaries truly formed non - coevally , then we might expect the systems with the most extreme or most similar mass ratios to show the largest discrepancy in ages .",
    "however , the dispersion in @xmath0@xmath1 for the five systems with @xmath49 is 0.41 dex , similar to the overall dispersion for our full sample ( 0.40 dex ) .",
    "if we limit this analysis to only the apparently coeval population ( @xmath0@xmath1@xmath340.40 dex ) , the dispersions are 0.17 dex and 0.16 dex , respectively .",
    "this indicates that there is no strong trend for reduced coevality in these extreme systems .",
    "hartigan et al . (",
    "1994 ) also found no such trend in their sample .    in figure 5 ,",
    "we plot @xmath0@xmath1 as a function of total system mass .",
    "most of our sample spans only a limited mass range ( 0.7 - 1.5 @xmath26 ) , but we see no evidence of a mass - dependent trend .",
    "our sample includes only four systems with a total mass of @xmath340.5 @xmath26 , but we also see no significant trend for a higher scatter in ages .",
    "the dispersion ( 0.36 dex ) is similar to that of the full sample , though almostly entirely dominated by one system ( 2m04554757 + 2m04554801 ) .",
    "our sample includes only two high - mass pairs , rw aur ab and v773 tau aab , for which we measure age discrepancies of 0.55 dex and 0.01 dex , respectively .    in figure 6 ,",
    "we plot @xmath0@xmath1 as a function of system separation .",
    "if the separation of a binary system scales with the protostellar core size when fragmentation occurred , then wider systems should typically fragment at an earlier stage than closer systems .",
    "this suggests that wide pairs might fragment earlier and evolve more independently , possibly yielding binary components with a larger dispersion in apparent ages .",
    "however , as for the previous figures , this comparison does not indicate any significant role of separation in establishing the binary component ages .",
    "the inner and outer halves of the sample ( divided at 800 au ) have dispersions of 0.37 dex versus 0.42 dex ( for the full set ) and 0.14 versus 0.18 dex ( for the coeval subset ) .",
    "we conclude that binary systems of all separations are similar coeval to within our observed limits .",
    "the lack of a separation - dependent trend in differential age begs an important question .",
    "if binary pairs are similarly coeval with their associated components , but significantly more coeval than the association as a whole , then what is the form of the transition between these regimes ? are adjacent ( but unassociated ) taurus members more coeval than distant members , or is the age spread similar across all spatial scales greater than the binary separation regime ?",
    "the distribution of taurus members has been suggested to represent a small number of subclusters ( e.g. gomez et al .",
    "1993 ) with radii of @xmath41 - 2@xmath50 ( @xmath45 pc ) , though it is unclear whether those groups are distinct from the large - scale filamentary ( and possibly fractal ) structure ( kraus & hillenbrand 2008 ) .",
    "if these apparent groupings are closely associated , then stars separated by @xmath345 pc might be more coeval than the wider association .    in figure 7",
    ", we address this question by plotting @xmath0@xmath1 as a function of separation for all possible pairs of the primary and secondary stars in our binary sample .",
    "we can not draw any conclusions for separations of 30 - 1000 ( 5000 au to 0.7 pc ) due to small number statistics , but the dispersion at larger separations ( as indicated by the standard deviation in bins 0.5 dex wide ) is consistently @xmath40.6 dex across the entire separation range .",
    "this result suggests that the coevality we see for binary systems ( figure 6 ) is limited to scales of @xmath340.7 pc .",
    "we can not determine if this coevality is limited exclusively to binary systems , though ; as we showed in our analysis of the spatial distributions of stars ( using two - point correlation functions ; kraus & hillenbrand 2008 ) , the binary regime only encompasses separations of @xmath72 .",
    "the observed scatter is unlikely to result from any distance dispersion of taurus members ( @xmath715 pc for members in similar parts of the cloud ; section 3.1 ) since it would yield a scatter of @xmath70.2 mag in @xmath33 or @xmath40.15 dex in @xmath51 ( 0.20 - 0.25 dex in @xmath0@xmath1 for a pair of stars ) .",
    "our results for binary pair age differences are consistent with theoretical predictions for the timescale of local star formation ( i.e. within one core ) and global star formation ( spanning the entire molecular cloud ) .",
    "if most binary systems in taurus are coeval to within @xmath340.16 dex ( including observational uncertainties ) , then given its median age ( 1.8@xmath170.2 myr ; appendix a ) , the formation times for binary components must differ by @xmath70.7 myr .",
    "the expected timescale for an individual protostar to collapse after achieving supercriticality is the dynamical timescale ( @xmath40.1 - 0.2 myr ; shu et al .",
    "1987 ) ; binary fragmentation is likely to occur during this collapse , so our limit is consistent with the predicted formation timescale .",
    "recent simulations that exploit smoothed - particle hydrodynamic and n - body codes also suggest that most binary systems form within @xmath70.5 myr ( delgado - donate et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in contrast , the timescale for global star formation is likely to be much longer , representing either the turbulent dissipation timescale ( @xmath41 myr ; ballesteros - paredes et al . 1999 ; elmegreen 2000 ) or the ambipolar diffusion timescale ( @xmath43 - 10 myr ; mouschovias 1976 ; shu 1977 ) .",
    "our limit on the age dispersion of binary pairs is shorter than either timescale , while the overall age dispersion for unrelated pairs of stars is consistent with the ambipolar diffusion timescale , but only marginally with the turbulent dissipation timescale .",
    "we found a dispersion of @xmath40.6 dex in @xmath0@xmath1 for random pairs , corresponding to a dispersion in @xmath51 of @xmath40.4 dex .",
    "for the median taurus age of @xmath41.8 myr , this corresponds to a typical age range of 1 - 5 myr .",
    "if our results do reveal two distributions ( one population that appears coeval and one that does not ) , then the number of systems in each distribution will allow a constraint on the fraction of binary systems that are genuinely coeval .",
    "of the 36 pairs of stars that we considered , 24 are coeval to within @xmath0@xmath42@xmath340.4 dex , while the other 12 have ages which are more discrepant .",
    "this suggests that @xmath1667@xmath52% of all binary systems are coeval with a dispersion of @xmath70.16 dex .",
    "however , many of the non - coeval pairs could be affected by systematic errors while being genuinely coeval , so this fraction is a lower limit .",
    "more intensive study of the apparently non - coeval pairs should be a priority ; as we discussed above , some stars ( such as v710 tau c , dk tau a , and xz tau b ) already seem potentially affected by systematic errors and might be rejected from our sample based on additional followup observations .",
    "finally , our results indicate that the properties of a binary system correlate only modestly with the formation timescale ; even extreme systems ( with very wide separations or disparate masses ) appear similarly coeval on average .",
    "conversely , unbound pairs of stars that are only modestly separated ( @xmath41 pc ) show the full age dispersion of the association .",
    "these trends strongly indicate that binary coevality is a natural result of the binary formation process itself , not a reflection of any trend for star formation to occur simultaneously within larger regions of the natal molecular cloud .",
    "we have studied the binary population of the taurus - auriga association in order to quantify the frequency and degree of noncoevality in young binary systems . after identifying and rejecting the systems that are known to be affected by systematic errors ( such as further multiplicity or obscuration by circumstellar material ) , we used pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks to infer individual ages for the individual stars in binary systems , and hence the relative binary ages . we have found that the overall dispersion in the relative ages ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) is 0.40 dex , though the distribution actually appears bimodal .",
    "random pairs of taurus members are coeval only to within 0.58 dex , suggesting that taurus binaries are more coeval than the association as a whole .",
    "the bimodality indicates that our sample is comprised of two populations , with @xmath42/3 appearing to be coeval binaries with a dispersion of @xmath2@xmath3@xmath40.16 dex and the other @xmath41/3 appearing to be systematically offset from coevality by @xmath40.6 dex .",
    "the non - coeval population shows no trends with respect to the system mass , separation , or mass ratio , which defies the predictions of many formation scenarios for non - coeval systems .",
    "we therefore suggest that the non - coeval population is comprised mainly of unrecognized hierarchical multiples , stars seen in scattered light , or stars with nir disk excesses ; identifying any truly non - coeval systems will require additional followup to rule out or correct for these explanations .",
    "the full range of apparent ages in our sample is @xmath41 dex , which suggests that a binary system tends to form in a very short period of time relative to the global star formation timescale for taurus .",
    "finally , we found that the relative coevality of binary systems does not depend significantly on the system mass , mass ratio , or separation .",
    "however , any pair of taurus members wider than @xmath410 ( @xmath40.7 pc ) shows the full age spread of the association .",
    "this suggests that the enhanced coevality is seen only for binary systems and not for neighboring stars that formed from separate protostellar cores .",
    "the apparent coevality of a large fraction of our sample is also a partial endorsement of pre - main sequence isochrones .",
    "we did invoke several corrections to the model tracks , but any additional mass - dependent error in ages would cause systems with unequal mass ratios to appear less coeval , and we see no such trend to within the uncertainties in our results .",
    "the authors thank r. white and g. herczeg for helpful feedback on several of the ideas presented here , as well as e. mamajek for a helpful discussion of taurus membership issues .",
    "we also thank the referee for a prompt and helpful review .",

    "the single stars of taurus provide a useful check on the validity of our results , as well as providing their own constraints on its star formation history . in this appendix",
    ", we compile a sample of all stars which have a significant probability of being single ( based on nondetections with one or more high - resolution imaging techniques ) .",
    "we then place these single stars on an hr diagram and estimate their ages and masses .",
    "finally , we investigate the dependence of apparent age on stellar mass and on location within the association .",
    "we list our sample of apparently single stars in table 3 , including all of the references for our adopted parameters ( singleness , spectral type , and extinction ) .",
    "we based our sample on the compilation of all taurus members that we originally described in kraus & hillenbrand 2007a ) , and then we omitted all stars that did not have at least one observation at high angular resolution .",
    "we then searched the literature for spectral types , requiring uncertainties of @xmath301 subclass for spectral types @xmath9k0 and @xmath302 subclasses for earlier - type stars .",
    "most stars have only been surveyed for multiplicity to a separation limit of 50 - 100 mas ( 7 - 15 au ) , so close binary systems still contaminate this sample . however , we do not expect any mass - dependent systematic biases .",
    "the binary fraction drops significantly with declining primary mass ( e.g. kraus et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) , but much of that drop is seen among the wider binary systems ( e.g. kraus & hillenbrand 2009 ) that would have fallen outside our required sensitivity limit of @xmath715 - 20 au .",
    "we inferred the fundamental properties of these stars ( luminosity and temperature , then age and mass ) using the methods described in section 3 .",
    "we list these properties in table 3 .      in figure a1",
    ", we show the hr diagram for our sample of single taurus members .",
    "the composition of our single - star sample is significantly different from our binary sample , featuring many high - mass ( @xmath91 @xmath26 ) and low - mass ( @xmath340.3 @xmath26 ) members , but few members with intermediate masses .",
    "this difference in composition is driven largely by selection biases since few binaries at either extremum of mass have spatially resolved spectra .",
    "high - mass binaries in taurus tend to be hierarchical multiples with additional components , while low - mass binaries were difficult to observe with spectroscopy before the recent advent of laser guide star ao . as a result",
    ", we must be very cautious in comparing the bulk properties of both samples .",
    "we also note that many members fall below our designated lower edge of the taurus sequence ( the 5 myr isochrone ) and might have erroneously low luminosities .",
    "most of these members have not been well - studied ( e.g. itg33a and i04301 + 2608 ) , so we can not reject them with certainty , but their presence as extreme outliers in our plots invites skepticism .",
    "most of the highest - mass members ( spt@xmath30k3 ; @xmath291 @xmath26 ) also fall systematically below the 1 - 2 myr isochrone .",
    "few of our binary sample members fall in this mass range , but those that do are either obviously erroneous ( the hbc stars ) or appear genuinely young .",
    "we have no satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy between the single stars and binary components since an error in our methods or in the underlying models should affect both populations equally , but the small number of high - mass stars in our binary sample suggests that the single - star sample might provide a more reliable indication of the true empirical isochrone .    in figure a2 , we show the model - derived age as a function of model - derived mass for our sample of single stars .",
    "most stars seem to track the median age of taurus , but as we noted above , the highest - mass stars ( @xmath161 @xmath26 ) appear systematically older .",
    "the brown dwarfs of taurus ( @xmath250.07 @xmath26 ) have very uncertain ages , so it is difficult to determine when they formed in relation to the stars .",
    "this uncertainty is driven by the physics of brown dwarf contraction , as isochrones at ages of @xmath710 myr follow similar tracks in the hr diagram . if we only consider members with masses of @xmath40.07 - 0.9 @xmath26 , then the median age of taurus is @xmath37@xmath53 yr ( @xmath54 myr ) .",
    "finally , in figure a3 , we show the spatial distribution of our single - star sample on the sky , with the position of each star color - coded according to its age , as well as the mean age for the eastern subgroup , southern subgroup , and the eastern and western halves of the central filaments .",
    "the eastern subgroup appears @xmath44@xmath2 older than the other subgroups ( 3.2 myr , versus 1.4 - 1.9 myr ) ; if this age difference is genuine , then it suggests that star formation occurred first in auriga , then in the rest of the association .",
    "however , this apparent age difference could also be a three - dimensional projection effect ; the difference of @xmath40.25 dex in mean age could be explained if the distance to auriga stars were @xmath415 - 20% larger than the mean distance to taurus ( @xmath4170 pc versus @xmath4145 pc ) .",
    "otherwise , there is no significant trend in the ages of taurus members , suggesting that global star formation proceeded nearly simultaneously ( to within @xmath70.3 myr ) .",
    "high - order multiple systems are a critical tool for constraining stellar evolutionary models . if these multiple systems form coevally , then they provide a simultaneous test of the models at three or more masses .",
    "this feature was exploited by white et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to constrain models with the well - known quadruple system gg tau and to infer the best set of models to use for low - mass stars ( the lyon models ) as well as to establish the best temperature scale for young stars ( luhman et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we now extend this analysis to a quadruple system ( uz tau ) , a quadruple that is part of a sextuple system ( v955 tau + lkha332/g2 ) , three components each of two systems that are not yet completely characterized ( fv tau and v773 tau ) , and three triple systems ( fs tau , v710 tau , and hl tau / xz tau ) , plus we replicate the analysis of white et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for gg tau to provide context .",
    "as we show in figure b1 , all three of the quadruple systems appear to have consistent ages .",
    "the consistency of gg tau is partly a result of its previous role in calibrating stellar models and temperature scales , but uz tau appears to be almost coeval and similarly consistent .",
    "three components of v955 tau + lkha332/g2 also fall along the 1 myr isochrone , but v955 tau b has an inferred age of @xmath43 myr .",
    "this is @xmath42@xmath2 away from a consistent age , but among 12 components , we would expect @xmath40.6 outliers at @xmath162@xmath2 .",
    "dynamical masses are available in the literature for the uz tau aab and gg tau aab pairs and can be compared to those inferred from the hr diagram .",
    "the consistency is mixed .",

    "( 1999 ) found from the circumbinary disk kinematics that the total system mass for gg tau aab is 1.28@xmath170.07 @xmath26 ; the total mass predicted by theoretical models ( 1.37 @xmath26 ) agrees to within @xmath47% .",
    "by contrast , prato et al . ( 2002 ) reported dynamical masses for uz tau aa and ab of 1.02@xmath170.06 @xmath26 and 0.29@xmath170.03 @xmath26 , while the masses predicted by theoretical models are 0.61 and 0.30 @xmath26 .",
    "the secondary mass agrees very well , but the discrepancy in the primary mass is very puzzling because its position in the hr diagram is virtually identical to that of gg tau ab , which has excellent consistency between observations and theory .",
    "prato et al .",
    "explored the possible sources of this discrepancy in much greater detail , so we simply note its existence as proof that hr diagram analysis plays a critical , but incomplete role in constraining stellar evolutionary models .",
    "a full study of evolutionary models must include their dynamical masses ( e.g. schaefer et al .",
    "2008 ) , not just their temperatures and luminosities .",
    "truly precise tests will also require direct measurement of radii ( stassun et al .",
    "2008 ) rather than indirect estimates from the stefan - boltzmann law and the observed luminosity and temperature .",
    "none of the three - component tests in our sample provide the same consistency seen among the quadruple systems , though as we described in section 3 , the two largest discrepancies are likely to be systematic .",

    "hl tau is also seen in scattered light in the optical , but our inferred age based on its @xmath18 magnitude seems consistent with that of xz tau a , suggesting that the central star of hl tau might dominate its luminosity in the nir . as we described in section 2 , xz tau b was suggested to be a possible binary pair by carrasco - gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which would explain its apparent overluminosity .",
    "fs tau a and fs tau b also appear moderately discrepant , sitting 1.5@xmath2 on either side of the 1 myr isochrone .",
    "fv tau aa and fv tau ba have very consistent ages , but fv tau bb sits somewhat lower in the hr diagram ; the only spatially resolved spectrum for fv tau bb is very noisy , so the apparent underluminosity could actually indicate that it has a later spectral type ( m5.0-m5.5 rather than m3.5 ) .",
