    "the nature of dark energy and dark matter remains an outstanding open problem in cosmology . in spite of the success of the @xmath0cdm parameterization",
    ", one must consider more complex models in order to cast some light on the substance of the dark components of the universe . in this work",
    "one considers models with interacting dark energy and dark matter  components .",
    "there are several useful tools to probe the phenomenology of these models , such as cmbr data @xcite , bao @xcite , sne data @xcite and the deviation from the virial equilibrium of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that grb may be used to extend the hubble diagram to high redshifts , greater than @xmath1 . at these epochs",
    "the universe was dominated by dark matter , from which follows that this tool is less sensitive to dark energy .",
    "however , for models where dark energy and matter are coupled @xcite or unified @xcite , grbs might be a particularly usefull tool @xcite .    in the late 1960s , the vela array of military satellites detected flashes of radiation originating in apparently random directions in space .",
    "the observed bursts lasted between tens of milisecond and thousands of seconds , and were composed of soft ( @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) gamma rays . subsequently space missions such as the us apollo program and the soviet venera probes confirmed the existence of the grbs , even though its rate of occurrence was virtually unknown until the deployment of the compton gamma ray observatory , in 1991 .",
    "this observatory was equipped with a sensitive gamma - ray detector , the burst and transient source explorer ( batse ) instrument which was able to detect one or two events per day .",
    "the collected data allowed to divide grbs into two categories : short duration bursts ( _ short _ bursts ) and long duration bursts ( _ long _ bursts ) .",
    "the former usually last for less than two seconds and are dominated by high energy photons ; the latter last longer than two seconds and are dominated by lower energy photons . however ,",
    "this distinction is not always clear .",
    "the physical origin of grbs has been debated for a long time , before their exact position and a reliable estimate of their distance was lacking ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in 1997 ,",
    "several grbs were detected by the bepposax sattelite .",
    "a grb _ prompt _ emission is followed by an _ afterglow _ emission composed by all wavelengths .",
    "depending on its brightness , an afterglow can last from days to months after the burst itself , the _ transient _ phase .",
    "the detection of the afterglow did manifold the information on grbs . through their afterglow ,",
    "grb s x - ray , optical and radio counterparts were observed , as well as their redshifts @xcite , confirming the cosmological origin of most , if not all , the grbs .",
    "when , in 2003 , the long grb 030329 was discovered and linked with the supernova sn2003dh , it became clear that grbs are linked with the release of gravitational energy during the collapse of stellar mass objects .",
    "grbs are most likely collimated , considering they reach integrated luminosities up to @xmath4 , making it hard to associate them with an astrophysical object otherwise .",
    "this high energy release creates an outflow that expands relativistically .",
    "two forms of shocks are ensued by the burst , the forward shock and the reverse one , which one separated by a contact discontinuity @xcite . if the ejected plasma is too strongly magnetized , only the forward shock is formed .",
    "one suggested possibility is that the prompt emission is generated in a baryon dominated ejecta through internal shocks , while the forward and reverse shocks yield the long lasting broadband emission , the afterglow @xcite . actually , the full understanding of the prompt emission mechanism , a basic grb property , is still lacking .",
    "one possibility is that the prompt emission consists of synchrotron radiation @xcite , by the relativistic charged particles moving on the magnetized ejected plasma .",
    "currently , the glast / fermi mission , in operation , is continuously increasing the available grb data and making it worth , as will be discussed and pursued in this work , considering future prospects for the subject . for an overview of most recent missions",
    "see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "grbs can be used as distance indicators .",
    "its main attractiveness is that the redshift range extends much higher than that of sne ia .",
    "the main observables that can be measured when studying grbs are its spherical equivalent energy , its peak isotropic luminosity , the peak energy of its spectrum , the photon fluence , the energy fluence , the pulse duration and the redshift of its host galaxy .",
    "several empirical correlations among these variables can be established . however , there are still large uncertainties in their calibration .",
    "furthermore , there is still no satisfying physical mechanism accounting for them , so that assuming that they hold true can introduce systematic uncertainties in our distance indicator . from the existing correlations",
    ", the very discussed ghirlanda relation uses the peak energy of the spectrum , @xmath5and the collimation corrected energy , @xmath6 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the liang and zang relation correlates the isotropic equivalent energy , @xmath7  with @xmath5  and the jet break time of the afterglow of the burst .",
    "finally , the amati relation , correlates the isotropic energy , @xmath7 , with @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this relation is particularly interesting since the @xmath5  - @xmath7  correlation requires only two parameters that can be directly inferred from the obervations .",
    "this correlation further emphasizes the relevance of the grb data .",
    "notice that the aforementioned synchrotron process reproduces the amati correlation , a quite interesting feature . in this work ,",
    "grb data and the amati relation , in particular , are used to probe a generic dark energy - dark matter interacting model . in section [ dedmint ] ,",
    "the interacting model is presented .",
    "the amati @xmath5  - @xmath7  correlation is introduced and discussed in section [ dataanalysis ] .",
    "the set of real grb data is then extended to a mock sample of 500 grbs using a method detailed in subsection [ genmock ] . in section [ method ]",
    ", one discusses the constrains obtained from sne data in subsection [ sns ] , bao in subsection [ baos ] and cmbr shift parameter in subsection [ cmbs ] . in section [ results ] one",
    "presents the obtained results . in section [ conclusion ] ,",
    "conclusions are presented .",
    "the cosmological model consists of homogeneous matter ( dark matter and baryons ) and dark energy , where the dark matter and energy are interacting and have equations of state , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . the coupled energy densities with a coupling @xmath10 evolve as follows @xcite : _ dm + 3 h _ dm & = & h _ dm  , [ bianchi1 ] + _ de + 3 h _ de ( 1 + w ) & = & -h _ dm  .",

    "it is interesting to point out that the generalized chaplygin gas model ( gcg ) @xcite , an unified model of dark energy and dark matter , can be seen as a particular case of this interacting model for @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 being the gcg equation of state parameter , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a positive constant .",
    "in this work one considers the amati @xmath5  - @xmath7  correlation ( for a discussion of the use of other correlations see for instance ) .",
    "this correlation can be used to place constrains on the hubble diagram . the sample provided in @xcite that includes the observations of @xmath29 grb with measurements for @xmath5 , @xmath7  and redshift ,",
    "is adopted .",
    "the value of @xmath5  is an observable quantity , independent of a cosmological model . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath7  is computed for each grb from its spectral parameters , fluence and redshift using a specific cosmological model ( the @xmath7  presented in @xcite is computed in the context of the @xmath0cdm scenario with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "the amati correlation assumes a power law relationship between @xmath5  and @xmath7 .",
    "a cosmological model can then be tested comparing the @xmath7  computed from the observations with a theoretical @xmath7  obtained from @xmath5 . in practice , however , since the @xmath5  -  @xmath7  relationship is not calibrated , one has to simultaneously fit for the power law parameters .",
    "furthermore , following @xcite , the scatter of the @xmath5-@xmath7  relation that can not be explained by statistical fluctuations alone must be taken into account .",
    "as in @xcite , this is done by introducing a third parameter , an extrinsic variance , @xmath33 , in the fitting of the data . using a power law @xmath5-@xmath7  relation , @xmath34 one aims to minimize the likelihood function , where @xmath35\\ ; , \\ ] ] and the total variance is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the observational variances on @xmath39  and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the fit is performed for the three parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath33 .",
    "this minimization is then carried out for different values of the cosmological parameters , resulting in a profile of the likelihood function .",
    "given that the grb data is currently rather limited , the analysis is extended to include a mock sample of grbs in order to test the efficiency of the amati relation on constraining dark energy and dark matter  interacting models .",
    "the goal is to check the effect of a larger number of grbs , but also the effect of higher redshift grbs . * from 2009 onwards , most of the useful events to fit the amati relation came from the swift and fermi experiments .",
    "one can expect from these experiments approximately 10 useful grb events per year .",
    "the future launch of the exist mission , scheduled for 2017 , will considerably improve this rate , hopefully simultaneously reducing the measurement errors .",
    "this paper settles on a best case scenario of 500 grbs events but conservatively keeping the error bars at the present level . *",
    "following @xcite , a distribution mimicking the observed grb redshift distribution in the range @xmath43 is used .",
    "a chosen percentage of these events was then replaced with redshifts uniformly distributed in the range @xmath44 .",
    "this allows for a tuning of the number of high redshift grbs in the mock sample that is used in the fits .",
    "notice that different choices on the shape of the high redshift distribution of grbs is approximately equivalent to a change on the redshift cutoff value and its percentage .",
    "ultimately , only a significant number of high redshift grbs can yield a sizable restriction on @xmath45 .",
    "the details about the actual low redshift distribution used to generate the mock data are discussed in the appendix .",
    "once a redshift distribution is obtained , lognormal distributed values of @xmath5  are attributed to each data point and are associated with a power law related @xmath7 . in this paper a value of @xmath46 for @xmath47 is used for the mean and a value of @xmath48 is used for the variance . an extrinsic variance ( using @xmath49 ) and gaussian errors for @xmath5  and @xmath7  ( @xmath50 for both ) are then included , mimicking the current observational situation .",
    "it is verified that the results are not particularly sensitive to these choices .",
    "several mocks with a varying number of low and high redshift grbs where generated and studied .",
    "the presented results consist of a typical mock sample with @xmath51 events generated and @xmath52 of high redshift grbs , in a @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "in order to gauge to which extent grb data can constrain cosmological parameters , one confronts it with other well known cosmologically relevant observational tests such as sne , bao and the cmbr shift parameter .      the sne sample from the sloan digital sky survey ii ( sdss - ii ) first - year results @xcite is used , consisting of @xmath53 sne ia with redshifts up to @xmath54 .",
    "sne are used as distance indicators by comparing the theoretical distance modulus , @xmath55 , obtained from the measured redshift in a given model of cosmological evolution , and with the inferred distance modulus , @xmath56 , computed from fits to the sne light curves ( using the data of the mlsc2k2 fits found in @xcite ) .",

    "one also considers the constraints from the effect of the baryon acoustic peak of the large scale correlation function at @xmath60 mpc separation detected by the sdss luminous red galaxy sample @xcite .",

    "even though the present grb data can not compete with these cmbr constraints , with additional data they can provide an important independent method of lifting the sne degeneracy in @xmath45 .",
    "it must be stressed that these results are obtained for @xmath77 fixed at @xmath78 .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "a mock population is chosen in order to show what can be accomplished from a large population of grbs , despite the current level of measurement and theoretical uncertainties .",

    "notwithstanding , the grb data has a similar profile to the cmbr bounds , and they can provide a significant bound in @xmath45 .",
    "thus , grb data , in combination with sne , provides an independent and compatible constraint on @xmath45 and @xmath84 . on the other hand ,",
    "the bao result clearly does not yield a strong constraint on the value of either @xmath84 or @xmath45 ( as opposed to the sne data ) , and does not significantly improve the results obtained from grbs or cmbr .",

    "the grb constraint on @xmath45 comes mostly from its high redshift valued data , whereas the low redshift valued sne data presents a degeneracy in @xmath45 .",
    "notice however that for the grb and cmbr data , one encounters a degeneracy in @xmath45 in the form of a bend occurring at @xmath87 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath88 ) .",
    "this occurs as for negative @xmath11 and for high @xmath14 , the evolution is dominated by the dark energy density , rendering the luminosity distance virtually independent of @xmath11 .",
    "in this work the use of grbs as cosmological tools is considered .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that grbs have a great potential to measure the value of @xmath89 independently from the cmbr constraints . in the current work",
    ", it is shown that the present grb data already gives a better constraint on the dark energy and dark matter  coupling parameter @xmath45 than the bao results .",
    "the sne results provide good bounds on @xmath84 , but are more degenerate in @xmath45 . despite of that",

    "these results are obtained without marginalization , for fixed @xmath92 .    a mock population of grbs",
    "was then generated showing that as the number of available events increases , grb data becomes a more and more valuable tool in constraining the parameter @xmath45 .",
