    "several astronomical observations , since observations of distant supernova type ia @xcite and cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements @xcite , have indicated that our universe is currently undergoing an accelerating phase of expansion .",
    "if we assume that the friedmann equation with perfect fluid source is valid then our universe is in acceleration phase due to the presence of matter with negative pressure violating the strong energy condition ( dark energy ) .",
    "while there are several candidates for description of dark energy like an evolving scalar field ( referred to as quintessence ) @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas @xcite or phantom dark energy @xcite the most obvious candidate for such a component of the dark energy seems to be the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "hence we obtain the most simple explanation of current universe which require two dark components , namely non - relativistic dust ( dark and baryonic matter ) contributing about 30% of the total energy density ( which is clustering gravitationally at small scales ) and second component ( dark energy ) which dominate at large scales and is smoothly distributed with constant density .",
    "unfortunately it is only some kind of effective theory which offers description of present observations rater then its understanding .",
    "for example it remains to understand why the value of cosmological constant obtained from observations of snia is so small in comparison with the vacuum energy ( planck mass scale ) .",
    "it is the main reason for looking for alternative explanation of observational data of distant supernovae .",
    "there have appeared many models that make use of new physics which may arise as a consequence of embedding of our universe in a more dimensional universe which accelerates due to some additional term in the friedmann equation rather than dark energy contribution @xcite .    in this work",
    "we discuss the possibility of the dark energy being represented by viscous fluid which is characterized by the presence of bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath2 in the effective equation of state .",
    "because we assume homogeneity and isotropy , only bulk viscosity effects may be important under such symmetry condition .",
    "frw models filled with a non - ideal ( dissipative ) fluid were investigated in several papers in which bulk viscosity was parameterized by an additional term in pressure @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bulk viscosity coefficient , usually parameterized , following belinskii , as power law @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the energy density and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants @xcite . while we know since the classical papers of murphy @xcite and heller @xcite that bulk viscosity effects can generate an accelerating phase of expansion the idea that the present acceleration epoch is driven by some kind viscous fluid is being explored recently @xcite .",
    "wilson et al .",
    "@xcite discussed a cosmology in this cold dark matter particle decay into relativistic particles and argued such a decay could lead naturally to bulk viscosity modelled by effective negative pressure .",
    "the main aim of the paper is to investigate the possibility of explaining the present accelerating expansion of the universe in terms of bulk viscosity with the background of models with robertson - walker symmetry , basing on analogy with the cosmology with the chaplygin gas and dynamical system methods .",
    "we show that the non - flat frw dissipative models can treated as a perturbed dynamical systems of the newtonian type .",
    "the chaplygin gas conception is taken from aerodynamics .",
    "kamenshchik at al .",
    "@xcite noted that from this equation of state can interpolate two stages  the stage of matter domination and the stage of dark energy domination .",
    "then it was generalized to the form of the generalized chaplygin gas @xmath9 by taking @xmath10 different from one .",
    "the reason was to increase the degree of generalization without any physical justification .    to have the physical meaning of this class of models we proposed to consider the frw model with bulk viscosity which is formally indistinguishable from the flat frw model with the generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "the advantage of the frw model with bulk viscosity is that its parameter possesses the physical interpretation  dissipation in the sense of bulk viscosity although the integral of energy is conserved and this model belongs to the class of models called conservative models described in terms of the potential function .",
    "one can distinguish between conservative and dissipative dynamical systems ( divergence of the vector field is zero for conservative , larger then zero for dissipative ) .",
    "we show that the flat frw with viscous fluid is conservative in the above sense .",
    "if we consider non flat models then the analogy between the flat frw model with bulk viscosity and the chaplygin gas model vanishes .",
    "in investigation of dynamical effect of bulk viscosity we use methods of dynamical system theory which offers the possibility of investigating all evolutional paths for all admissible initial conditions . in this approach",
    "the key point is the visualization ( geometrization ) of dynamics with the help of phase space .",
    "we consider dissipative cosmology ( as well as conservative ) in terms of a single potential function which determines the dynamics on a @xmath11-dimensional phase space @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scale factor , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the cosmological time .",
    "inspired by the fact that viscous fluid possesses negative pressure and in flat models can be modelled as a chaplygin gas we have undertaken the simple task of studying the frw viscous cosmology .",
    "the dissipative cosmological model have at least a few significant advantages from the theoretical as well as observational point of view :    1 .",
    "they can describe a smooth transition from a decelerated ",
    "matter dominated expansion of the universe to the present epoch of cosmic acceleration ; 2 .",
    "they offer the possibility of unification on phenomenological ground both dark energy and dark matter ; 3 .",
    "they can be treated as a natural extension of the cdm models in which effects of dissipation are unified ; moreover from confrontation with snia data they are a serious alternative to the concordance @xmath1cdm model ; 4 .   in the flat cosmology",
    "they can be identified with conservative models which are structurally stable , i.e. such that a small perturbation does not change their global scenario .",
    "organization of the text is the following . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we describe all classes of frw conservative models with dark energy in terms of potential function for fictitious particle moving on the constant energy level . in section [ sec:3 ] the dynamics of conservative dark energy models with dissipation",
    "is investigated in tools of qualitative theory of differential equation in the @xmath11-dimensional phase space .",
    "the full analysis of dynamics of viscous models in terms of perturbed conservative systems is performed for the constant bulk viscosity coefficient .",
    "we also define the distance the conservative and perturbative systems using the sobolev metric .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] contains some observational constraints from distant supernovae type ia .",
    "these observational constraints indicate that unified model for dark energy and dark matter through the employment of dissipation is favored over the @xmath1cdm model by the bayesian information criteria of model selection .",
    "the frw dynamics of a broad class of dark energy models can be represented by the motion of a fictitious particle in one dimensional potential @xmath16 , where @xmath13 is the scale factor .",
    "the equation of motion assumes the form of a @xmath11-dimensional dynamical system of a newtonian type @xmath17 where @xmath18 and effective energy density satisfies the conservation condition @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hubble function and @xmath13 is the scale factor expressed in units of its present value @xmath21 .",
    "therefore different dark energy universe models filled with dust matter and dark energy satisfy the general form of the equation of state @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the effective pressure and energy density , respectively .",
    "the index zero denotes that the quantities are calculated at the present epoch .",
    "they can be classified in terms of the potential function ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) . in this table",
    "we used redshift @xmath24 instead of the scale factor @xmath13 because of the relation @xmath25 and dimensionless density parameters for each component @xmath26 .",
    ".different dark energy models in terms of the potential function parameterized by the scale factor or redshift @xmath24 ( @xmath27 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tab:5 ] we present results of analysis of four flat dark energy models with two free parameters , i.e. , the models with @xmath28 . on",
    "could note that both the aic and bic prefer the case @xmath29 i.e viscosity model with @xmath29 over the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "it is interesting to observe that if the value of @xmath8 parameter was derived from physics then number of independent model parameter would be lower by one and the viscous model is favored over the @xmath1cdm model by model selection criteria ( the values of aic and bic for the flat @xmath1cdm model are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , see @xcite ) .      for deeper statistical analysis",
    "it is used the bayes factor @xcite . using this technique we compare the viscous models with the concordance @xmath1cdm model .    in the bayesian framework to compare models ( the model set @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) is to find the value of probability in the light of data ( so called a posterior probability ) for each model .",
    "we can define the posterior odds for models @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which ( in the case when no model is favored a priori ) is reduced to the marginal likelihood ( @xmath36 ) ratio ( so called the bayes factor ",
    "@xmath37 ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the parameter vector , which defines model @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the likelihood under a model @xmath40 , @xmath42 is the prior probability for @xmath43 under a model @xmath40 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the flat frw model with bulk viscosity and fixed baryonic matter ( @xmath44 ) with the concordance @xmath1cdm model .    to compare models @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath35 one can compute @xmath45 which can be interpret as ` strength of evidence ' against @xmath46 model : @xmath47not worth more than a bare mention , @xmath48  positive , @xmath49  strong , and @xmath50  very strong .",
    "it is useful to choose one model from our model set ( a reference model@xmath51 ) and compare the rest models with this one model , situation in which @xmath52 indicates evidence against model @xmath40 with respect to the reference model , whereas @xmath53 denotes evidence in favor of model @xmath40 .",
    "we can compute posterior probability for model @xmath40 in the following way @xmath54 where @xmath55 $ ] . then one can see how prior believe about model probability @xmath56 change after inclusion data to analysis .",
    "this is the probability for model @xmath40 being the best model from the set of models under consideration .    assuming equal priors for both concurrence models @xmath57 we can calculate the posterior probabilities as @xmath58 for the viscous model and @xmath59 for the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "this indicates that the former model should be treated seriously as a candidate for dark energy description ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we apply the theory of qualitative investigations of differential equations to the study of dissipative cosmological model with dark energy .",
    "we show that application of qualitative theory of dynamical system allows to reveal some structural stability properties of this model .",
    "we demonstrate that they describe a smooth transition from a decelerated expansion phase dominated by matter contribution to the present dark energy epoch .",
    "we can find one - to - one correspondence between models with generalized chaplygin gas ( @xmath60 ) and models filled by viscous fluid ( @xmath61 ) in the flat case .",
    "it is established if we use belinskii power law parameterization of viscosity coefficient @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we conclude that while the @xmath1cdm model comes in good agreement with other observational data , mainly those from wmap and dynamics of clusters of galaxies , the fitting quality for dissipative model is comparable to that value obtained for models with @xmath1 .",
    "we supplemented our analysis with confidence intervals in the @xmath64 plane .",
    "our result show also that viscous cosmology predicts that at distance @xmath65 supernovae should be brighter than in the @xmath1cdm model .    for deeper analysis of statistical results and to decide which model ( with dark energy with or without dissipation )",
    "is distinguished we use the akaike and bayesian information criteria . applying the model selection criteria we show that both the aic and bic indicate that additional contribution arising from the dissipative effects should be incorporated to the model if only physics fix the value of the parameter @xmath8 .    since classical papers of murphy @xcite and heller",
    "@xcite it is well known that bulk viscosity can produce cosmological models without the initial singularity for flat universes . in an analogous way one can consider influence of bulk viscosity effects on avoiding the singularities in the future , namely so called big - rip singularities appearing in phantom cosmology @xcite .",
    "let us note that if @xmath66 ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) then we have upper bound on the value of the scale factor if only @xmath69 .",
    "this means that viscosity effects acting in phantom s matter can give rise to avoidance of big - rip singularity in the future .    using the analogy of dissipative cosmology to the conservative one with the chaplygin gas",
    ", one can find at least three significant features of dissipative cosmology @xcite .",
    "first , similarly to the conservative models with the chaplygin gas they describe a smooth transition from a decelerated to the present accelerated expansion .",
    "second , the models attempt to give a unified phenomenological description of both dark energy and dark matter in a natural way without references to effects of immersion of our universe into higher dimensional bulk spaces or tachyon cosmological models .",
    "third , they are a simple and natural extension of the @xmath1cdm model which has the property of flexibility with regard to the observational data .",
    "* the general frw model with bulk viscosity parameterized by the belinskii power - law parameterization is the two - dimensional dynamical system and framework of dynamical systems methods can be applied ; we showed that the phase portrait of the model with bulk viscosity with parameter values obtained from statistical analysis is equivalent to the phase portrait of the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "* for the special case of the flat model the effect of bulk viscosity are formally equivalent to the effects of generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "we have found simple relation between parameter @xmath10 from the equation of state of the generalized chaplygin gas ( @xmath70 ) and the parameter @xmath8 taken from the belinskii parameterization of viscosity @xmath71 .",
    "these models are formally equivalent and can not be distinguished using the kinematic cosmological tests based on the observables obtained from null geodesics .",
    "* moreover in the case of flat models dynamics can be reduced to the form of conservative system of the newtonian type . * in the special case of the flat model with constant viscosity we have formulated the theorem 1 which states that the solution for viscous model can be obtain from the the solution of the model without the viscosity .    an additional argument for incorporating of the new dissipative parameter is brought by the theory which will always favor the structurally stable models over fragile ones .",
    "we show that viscosity effects give rise to structurally stable evolutional scenario with squeezing bounce phase predicted by loop quantum gravity . however we must remember that flat cosmological model with viscosity effects is equivalent to the frw model with the generalized chaplygin gas and is not better than the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "there is a class of dynamical systems of cosmological origin like the cosmological models of loop quantum gravity in which instead of an initial singularity we have a bounce @xcite .",
    "the corresponding dynamical systems is structurally unstable ( see section ii ) because of the presence of the center in the phase portrait . therefore following the peixoto theorem they are exceptional among the cosmological models on the plane . in the bouncing cosmology",
    "the acceleration of the universe is only transient phenomenon and this is a non - generic case . due to effect of bulk viscosity",
    "they become structurally stable models .",
    "one can derive some philosophical conclusions from our analysis .",
    "the arrow of time @xcite is a physical mystery because while fundamental laws of physics are cpt invariant there is thermodynamical arrow of time prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics and cosmological arrow of time prescribed by expansion of the universe .",
    "if our universe is not flat then dissipative effects of bulk viscosity can determine the cosmological arrow of time ."
