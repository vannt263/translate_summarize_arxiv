    "nanoscale devices can now be fabricated with channels where the smallest dimension is just a few nanometers @xcite , and the development of nanofluidic theory @xcite is more relevant than ever .",
    "consider the following example .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite used a series of rectangular nanochannels with widths ranging from 14 to 300 nm to connect two micro - scale chambers . by means of capillary filling , fluid from one chamber",
    "fills up the channels and thus connects the two chambers .",
    "the filling rate can be measured for different channel widths and for both milli - q water ( filtrated de - ionized water ) and an electrolyte solution of sodium chloride .",
    "the rate did not follow the washburn equation for channel widths smaller than 100 nm .",
    "the washburn equation is based on the classical continuum picture @xcite using poiseuille law of fluid motion which includes the newtonian ( or macroscopic ) shear viscosity . for widths larger than 100",
    "nm the washburn equation correctly predicts the filling rate .",
    "this is in accordance with the common understanding that the discrete nature of the fluid at small scales destroys the continuum picture @xcite .",
    "in fact , many researchers categorize continuum physics as physics on the macroscopic scale , see for example ref . .",
    "several questions immediately arise : when exactly does the continuum picture fail ?",
    "how is this breakdown manifested ?",
    "does the length scale of the breakdown depend on the specific problem ?",
    "can one improve the continuum description such that it applies on small scales ?",
    "demanding sufficient smoothness of the macroscopic quantities with respect to time and position and using a simple statistical argument , lautrup @xcite estimates that the smallest volume accessible to the continuum description must contain at least 10@xmath0 molecules .",
    "this corresponds to a length scale of 8 - 80 nm , depending on the density . for steady",
    "flows the temporal fluctuations can be averaged out and the accessible volume is much smaller .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : motivation ] , where we have performed an atomistic simulation ( data given by blue filled circles ) of a methane fluid confined between two graphene sheets undergoing a poiseuille flow .",
    "the slit - pore has a width of approximately 3.3 nm and the flow is driven by an external force field . in this paper the simulations",
    "are carried out using the ` seplib ` library @xcite .",
    "the classical continuum prediction is plotted as two red lines illustrating the maximum and minimum profiles allowed within statistical uncertainty on the newtonian shear viscosity @xcite .",
    "only the fluid slip velocity at the wall surface is used as a fitting parameter .    for this system",
    "the continuum theory gives a satisfactory description of the fluid average velocity a length scale of a few nanometers .",
    "apparently , even on these small length scales the molecular structure and degrees of freedom can be coarsened into simple transport coefficients like the viscosity . for water undergoing a steady flow it has been shown by atomistic simulations that the continuum description holds for channel widths of just 6 - 10 nm @xcite .",
    "these results contrast earlier assumptions about the validity of the continuum picture , and the statement that continuum physics is physics on the macroscopic scale @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was later argued by thamdrup _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that the disagreement between the experiment by persson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and the washburn prediction is due to pinned micro - bubles resulting in an increase in hydraulic resistance .    at some point",
    "the classical continuum description will of course break down . to mention two examples , travis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that for atomic fluidic systems the velocity profile features modulations for confinements in the order of 5 atomic diameters .",
    "decheverry and bocquet @xcite analyzed the effect of thermal fluctuations on mass transport of fluid through a nanotube .",
    "interestingly , when the classical continuum theory fails , the dynamics is frequently quantified by different transport coefficients compared to those of the bulk system and effective transport coefficients are introduced into the continuum constitutive relations @xcite .",
    "the main point of this paper is that the observation of a breakdown need not be a failure of the continuum picture itself , but a result of inadequate modeling wherein important dynamical processes are not accounted for by classical theories . a very well understood example is the effect of the debye screening layer in electrolyte micro - flows @xcite .",
    "two other physical mechanisms that become important on the nanoscale are often ignored in the literature , and this paper will treat these in detail :    \\(i ) in classical hydrodynamics the fluid s local rotation is determined uniquely by the fluid streaming velocity .",
    "one can quantify the rotation from the local angular velocity field which is one half the vorticity , that is , one half the curl of the streaming velocity itself @xcite .",
    "however , if the couple force , that is , the force component producing pure rotation , is large , the rotation must be treated as an independent variable .",
    "the extended description is known as cosserat ( or micropolar ) continuum mechanics @xcite , first formulated by the cosserat brothers @xcite in the late 19th century .",
    "cosserat continuum theory is used in various areas such as liquid crystal studies @xcite and blood flows @xcite , and was studied intensively in the 1950s to 1970s , see refs . .",
    "for some reason it is not , however adopted by the nanofluidic community . we show that cosserat theory must also be used for fluid flows in extremely small confinements where the molecular structure becomes important .",
    "\\(ii ) classical hydrodynamics is based on local constitutive models relating fluxes to thermodynamic forces .",
    "for a shear flow the stress at some point depends on the strain - rate at that particular point .",
    "if the stress depends linearly on the strain rate , this leads to the newtonian law of viscosity @xcite .",
    "a more general constitutive relation is to let the stress be a function in the entire strain rate history and spatial distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ , given by a spatial and temporal convolution integral of a viscosity kernel and the strain rate @xcite .",
    "this is the approach of generalized linear response theory @xcite .",
    "the viscosity kernel accounts for the characteristic length scale of the spatial correlations @xcite ; we show below that this must be taken into account in order to arrive at the correct fluid response on molecular length scales .",
    "our presentation is based on comparisons of continuum predictions with atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation data .",
    "these two descriptions are fundamentally different in two ways .",
    "first , in md the system is characterized by discrete particles where the path of each individual particle constituting the fluid is traced out through classical mechanics @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the particle interactions must be known .",
    "the discretization of matter is , of course , in strong contrast to the fundamental assumptions of continuum mechanics .",
    "secondly , the continuum description applies constitutive relations to form mathematical closed problems .",
    "no such models are enforced in the standard md simulations .",
    "any discrepancy between md and the continuum description may therefore be a result of a breakdown of the constitutive relation rather than a break down of the continuum theory as such .",
    "our basic conjecture is that md acts as an idealized numerical experiment , and if a given continuum theory agrees with the md data , the theory correctly accounts for the phenomena we study .",
    "let us specify , more accurately , what is meant by continuum theory .",
    "basically , one refers to deformable fluid volumes characterized by quantities which are continuous at any point @xmath1 over the entire volume and at any time @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this means that these quantities are described mathematically by field variables .",
    "the basic continuum hypothesis is that one can associate a given fluid sub - volume ( or `` fluid particle '' ) with the same characteristic quantities of the entire deformable fluid volume , no matter how small the sub - volume @xcite .",
    "lautrup @xcite suggests a lower limit of the order of 10@xmath0 molecules as stated above , but time averaging allows an arbitrarily small fluid particle volume as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : motivation ] .",
    "one field variable is the streaming velocity , which is the mass - weighted average velocity of the individual molecules in the fluid particle around a given point @xcite .",
    "the fluid s dynamics is governed by balance ( or conservation ) equations . in general",
    "the balance equation for some quantity per unit mass , @xmath3 , reads in the eulerian differential form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass density , @xmath6 a production term , @xmath7 the streaming velocity , and @xmath8 the flux of @xmath9 . here",

    "the body force density can be a gravitational - like force driving the flow as in fig .",

    "( [ eq : generalbalance ] ) must be formulated for rotation ; this is done in the _ supporting information_. ( si ) importantly , in the extended cosserat description the pressure tensor @xmath13 need not be symmetric @xcite as in the classical continuum theory .",
    "comparison between the continuum description and md simulation data is carried out for molecular fluidic systems at equilibrium , as well as for steady flows in a slit - pore . here",
    "we investigate four molecular fluids : a methane fluid , a generic di - atomic ( dumbbell ) fluid , liquid butane , and liquid water .",
    "for methane 75 percent of the mass is centered in the carbon nucleus and methane is here considered as a simple spherical point - mass molecule , as it was done in fig .",
    "[ fig : motivation ] .",
    "water will , on the other hand , be treated differently using the flexible spc / fw water model @xcite that accounts for the molecular structure and hydrogen bonds and thus for the structure of liquid water .",
    "the butane model is a coarse grained model where the methyl and methylene groups are represented by a united atomic unit , _",

    ", however , here flexible bond are implemented with parameters from the generalized amber force field @xcite .",
    "the simulations are done using the ` seplib ` library @xcite .",
    "nanofluidic flows are often associated with fluid slippage at the wall boundary @xcite . just like the effect of the fluid - fluid interactions on the flow is lumped into a single parameter , _",
    "e.g. _ , viscosity , one effect from the fluid - solid interaction can be modelled into a friction coefficient determining the boundary slip .",
    "the slippage has a large effect on the flow rate in extreme confinement and is usually quantified by the slip length @xmath14 . for a hagen - poiseuille flow in a tube with radius @xmath15 the relative flow enhancement @xmath16 due to the slip is given as @xcite @xmath17 @xmath14 is typically in the order of a few nanometers .",
    "thus , for a given non - zero slip length the flow enhancement increases hyperbolically as the tube radius decreases .",
    "the slip is always present , but has insignificant effect on the flow rate for tube radii above microns .",
