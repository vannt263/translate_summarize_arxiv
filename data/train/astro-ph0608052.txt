    "[ fig7 ] we have plotted the observed magnitudes against metallicity after having removed the period dependency . the metallicity effect is weak for the fundamental pulsators and for the first - overtone pulsators the metallicity effect is consistent with only a marginal dependence . in both cases the relations are in reasonable agreement with the predictions from the shb models .",
    "current @xmath36 pl relations present two substantial differences when compared with the plz relation derived by bono et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : a ) we derived independent pl relations for f and fo pulsators , while bono et al . only derived semi - empirical `` average ''",
    "pl relations for f and fundamentalized fo pulsators ; b ) current pl relations only apply to cluster variables for which we can estimate the hb type , while the plz relation derived by bono et al .",
    "( 2003 ) applies to individual rr lyrae stars .",
    "in table [ tab.distances ] we have listed recent empirical distance estimates to where we have corrected all the moduli for the same reddening and employed the same reddening law as we have used for the rr lyrae stars .",
    "we note that our new near - ir results are in excellent agreement with the largely geometric distance to the eclipsing binary oglegc-17 from thompson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and from the first overtone blue edge method based on pulsation predictions from caputo et al .",
    "current distance determinations based on @xmath0 and @xmath36 measurements and on nir pl(@xmath41 ) relations are also in very good agreement with similar estimates based on nir relations derived by cps04 . in particular , for @xmath105 and @xmath106 we found @xmath107 vs @xmath108 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath109 vs @xmath110 ( @xmath37 ) . note that distance estimates based on cps04 relations were determined using the same solar metal abundance and we did not include a few very metal - poor rr lyrae , since cps04 prediction range from z=0.0005 to z=0.006 .",
    "this finding is also supported by most recent @xmath111[fe / h ] relations . by adopting the mean v - magnitudes for rr lyrae stars provided by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and by butler et al .",
    "( 1978 ) together with the calibration given by bono et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we obtain for rr lyrae with individual metal abundances a distance value of @xmath112 .",
    "we obtain a similar distance modulus ( @xmath113 ) using the same magnitudes and the recent calibration of the @xmath111[fe / h ] relation provided by catelan ( 2005 ) .",
    "the slope of such a relation was estimated by cacciari & clementini ( 2003 ) , while the zero - point is based on the trigonometric parallax of rr lyr itself ( benedict et al .",
    "2002 ; bono et al .",
    "note that the systematic error for distance estimates based on visual magnitudes is @xmath114 , due to the significant contribution from the absorption correction .",
    "on the other hand , we deviate by more than three @xmath48 from the distance evaluation based on high amplitude @xmath7 scuti ( hads ) stars ( @xmath115 , mcnamara 2000 ) and from the modulus of @xmath116 from van de ven et al .",
    "( 2006 ) based on cluster star dynamics .",
    "it is worth noting that current uncertainties on metal abundance and on nir photometry can not account for such a discrepancy .",
    "the nir @xmath8 relations for rr lyrae stars provide an accurate approach for determining absolute distances to globular clusters and other stellar systems .",
    "we find for a distance modulus of @xmath117 where the error estimates are random and systematic errors , respectively .",
    "we note that for populous systems like globulars and dwarf galaxies the dominating source of error are the systematic sources .",
    "the accuracy of nir photometry in crowded regions significantly improved during the last few years and the sample sizes will certainly benefit from the new large field of view nir cameras available at 4 m class telescopes ( van der bliek et al .",
    "new @xmath118band light curve templates for both fundamental and first overtone rr lyrae are also urgently required to improve the accuracy of their mean magnitudes in this band .",
