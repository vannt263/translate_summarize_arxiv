    "non - ergodic transport properties of anderson insulators have been reported in a number of systems studied at low temperatures @xcite . when excited from equilibrium by e.g. , a sudden change of a gate voltage , the conductance of the system increases , and this excess conductance @xmath3 persists for long times ( in some cases , days ) after the excitation .",
    "et al _ @xcite argued that such extended relaxation times as well as various memory effects exhibited by these systems are difficult to explain unless electron - electron correlations play a decisive role @xcite . for a medium that lacks metallic screening ,",
    "it is natural to assume that the coulomb interaction is relevant .",
    "this point of view was indeed taken in some theoretical models where the long range nature of the coulomb interaction was used to justify a mean - field treatment @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore the behavior the electron - glass when the system size approaches the mesoscopic regime of hopping conductance .",
    "the study is motivated by two main reasons .",
    "one goal is to assess the spatial range of correlation in the electron glass by monitoring the dynamics as function of system size ( which seems a viable approach when dealing with a long range interaction like the un - screened coulomb potential ) .",
    "this is based on the notion that the slow relaxation is presumably a result of a many - particle scenario @xcite , and therefore the dynamics should become size dependent below a certain scale @xcite .",
    "another reason to study small systems is that it should shed light on the interplay between the electron slow - dynamics and the ionic one which may be reflected in the temporal aspect of some specific mesoscopic effects .",
    "our main finding is that at least down to sample size @xmath4 of few microns the basic electron - glass properties , namely , slow - relaxation , memory , and aging remain essentially the same as in macroscopic samples .",
    "in particular , the characteristic relaxation time , observable in relaxation experiments of @xmath5 shows no scale dependence when the sample size is changed from millimeters down to 2  @xmath6 m .    at liquid helium temperatures , samples with @xmath7100@xmath2 m exhibit reproducible conductance fluctuation ( cf ) as function of the chemical potential",
    "these are observable in the conductance versus gate - voltage @xmath8 scans as a fluctuating component of @xmath9 defining a sample - specific pattern that changes form when the sample is thermally re - cycled .",
    "the cf pattern appears whether or not the underlying glassy system was allowed to equilibrate prior to taking a @xmath8 sweep .",
    "a @xmath8 scan taken after the sample equilibrates reveals the usual memory - cusp , which is the main earmark of the electron - glass @xcite while the cf appear just as a superimposed structure with no sign of inter - modulation effects .",
    "the two types of conductance modulation observable in the @xmath8 scans , namely the cf and memory - cusp , are shown to be distinct physical phenomena ; they are associated with different spatial scales , and quite different time scales .",
    "the @xmath0 films used in this work were e - gun evaporated on a @xmath10 insulating layer ( @xmath11 m thick ) thermally grown on a @xmath12100@xmath13 si wafer .",
    "the choice of @xmath14 the crystalline version of indium - oxide for this study was motivated by its essentially constant stoichiometry ( due to crystal chemistry constraints ) hence a fairly constant carrier concentration .",
    "as was shown previously using the amorphous version , a change in carrier concentration may lead to a large variance in the glassy features @xcite , which might mask the size dependence .",
    "the si wafer was boron doped and had resistivity @xmath15@xmath16 deep in the degenerate regime .",
    "it thus could be used as an equipotential gate electrode for a low - temperature measurement where the @xmath0 served as the active layer in a 3-terminal device .",
    "lateral dimensions of the samples were controlled using a stainless steel mask ( for samples larger than @xmath17 mm ) , or optical lithography ( for sizes in the range @xmath18 m ) , and e - beam lithography for samples smaller than @xmath19 m .",
    "samples used in this study had length @xmath4 and width @xmath20 that ranged from @xmath21 m to @xmath22mm@xmath23 and typical thickness @xmath24 .",
    "the ` source ' and ` drain ' contacts to the @xmath0 film were made from thermally evaporated @xmath25@xmath26thick gold films .",
    "fuller details of sample preparation and characterization are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "conductance measurements were performed using two terminal ac technique , employing ithaco-1211 current preamplifier and par-124a lock - in amplifier . in the mosfet - like samples ,",
    "gate voltage sweeps were affected by charging a @xmath27f capacitor with a constant current source .",
    "all the measurements reported here were performed with the samples immersed in liquid helium at @xmath28k held by a 100 liters storage - dewar .",
    "this allowed long term measurements without disturbing the samples as well as a convenient way to maintain a stable bath temperature .",
    "these requirements are of particular importance for studies of glassy systems where sample history may influence time dependent measurements , as was demonstrated in previous studies @xcite .",
    "care was taken to use small bias in the conductance measurements to ensure linear - response conditions , and in general that was the case .",
    "the only exception is in the 2  @xmath6 m samples where some deviations from ohms law were observable even at the lowest bias we managed to measure with a reasonable signal to noise ratio ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the emphasis in this work is the evolution of the glassy features as the size of the system is reduced .",
    "these features are observable by performing conductance measurements employing low frequency techniques , and therefore flicker noise becomes a major problem in reducing the system size .",
    "mesoscopic samples naturally exhibit a larger 1/f - noise than macroscopic specimen with similar resistance ( and measured at the same temperature ) .",
    "it was shown elsewhere that the 1/f - noise magnitude in these samples scales with the inverse sample volume as expected of independent fluctuators @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath4 smaller than few microns the noise overshadows some of the glassy features , which made it difficult to study samples with @xmath29m@xmath30 the other feature that becomes progressively more prominent as @xmath4 goes smaller is a set sample - specific pattern that modulates the conductance .",
    "these ` conductance fluctuations ' ( cf ) are seen in the gate - voltage sweeps @xmath31 , which is the main method to study the various glassy properties .",
    "when the sample size is reduced , the cf , much like the 1/f - noise , eventually masks the glassy effects . in this subsection",
    "we describe the phenomenology of the cf and their relation to the glassy dynamics on one hand and to the 1/f noise on the other hand .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath8 scans for two of the studied samples , illustrating the reproducibility of the cf pattern upon repeated scans ( figure 1a and figure 1b ) .",
    "there are obviously some deviations from perfect reproducibility , but they are always within the level expected from the observed magnitude of the 1/f noise .",
    "( namely , the deviation , judged by the cross - correlation between a traces taken at time @xmath32 and @xmath33 never exceeded the magnitude of the noise estimated at @xmath34^{-1}).$ ] another general trend is that the relative reproducibility appears to be better the smaller is the sample area .",
    "the degree of reproducibility was not sensitive to the scan rate of @xmath35 ( tested over the range of 0.1 - 100  mv / s ) so we are inclined to believe that irreproducibility is due to an inherent process , probably related to the 1/f - noise .    the relative magnitude of both , the cf and the 1/f - noise depends on the sample resistance and temperature , as well as on the sample size .",
    "the dependence of the rms @xmath3 associated with the cf on the sample area @xmath36 for samples with similar resistances and measured at the same temperature is shown in figure 1c ( compare with fig.2 in reference @xcite ) .",
    "the two traces in figure 1a were taken one after the other starting _ immediately _ after quench - cooling the sample from @xmath37k to @xmath38k@xmath30 figure 2 , on the other hand , shows @xmath8 traces for a sample taken _",
    "after _ it was allowed to equilibrate for 12 hours with @xmath35 held at @xmath39v . for the second and third quench - cool runs included in the figure , the sample was first warmed up to @xmath40k , held there for @xmath41 and then quench - cooled to @xmath42k and allowed to relax again for 12 hours prior to taking a @xmath8 sweep . in all these instances the @xmath8 curves show a ` memory - cusp ' centered at the gate voltage at which the sample equilibrated , in addition to a distinctive set of cf ( figure 2a ) .",
    "note that , for each quench , a _",
    "quench - specific _ set of cf is obtained while the average value of @xmath43 is nearly identical ( figure 2a ) , and so is the shape of the associated memory - cusp ( figure 2b ) .    before discussing the interplay between the cf and the memory - cusp , the origin of the cf in these samples needs to be clarified .",
    "there is some similarity in behavior between the cf observed in our @xmath8 and the ucf phenomenon familiar from the weak localization ( diffusive ) regime @xcite .",
    "most notably in that the fluctuation pattern produced is like a set of ` finger - prints ' characteristic of a particular structural , frozen - in configuration .",
    "however , the underlying mechanisms for the two phenomena are different ; the ucf is a quantum interference effect usually produced by sweeping a magnetic field @xmath44 that modulates @xmath43 via the aharonov - bohm effect ( similar behavior has been observed in gate experiments on diffusive samples , likewise related to an interference effect @xcite ) . the cf observed here is associated with a mechanism offered by lee @xcite to account for experiments on quasi - one dimensional hopping samples @xcite . in terms of variable range hopping our samples",
    "are therefore effectively two - dimensional ( a typical hopping length in our samples at the temperatures used in this work is @xmath45  @xcite , which is larger than the thickness @xmath46 ) .",
    "the underlying physics of lee s mechanism however , does not depend on the particular dimensionality : the current in hopping systems is carried in a percolation - network and controlled by a relatively small number of ` critical ' or ` bottleneck ' resistors @xcite . like any other resistor in the system ,",
    "the values of these resistors are given by the miller - abrahams expressions @xcite @xmath47 $ ] where @xmath48 is the inter - site distance in space , @xmath49is the localization length , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are the site energies , and @xmath6 is the chemical potential",
    ". therefore the actual resistance of these circuit elements depend ( among other things ) on the value of the chemical potential .",
    "sweeping the gate voltage causes the chemical potential to change thereby re - shuffling the values of the resistors in the system .",
    "the cf pattern in this picture reflects the process by which some critical resistors in the percolation network are replaced by other critical resistors as the chemical potential is varied @xcite . the fact that by going back and forth with @xmath35 the pattern reproduces itself suggests that there is an underlying backbone structure of sites that are fairly stable , most likely the positions of the ions that control the disorder in the system",
    "this is the analog of the distribution of scattering centers that determine the magnetic fingerprints in the ucf effect . in both phenomena",
    "the underlying structure changes upon thermal recycling , and in both the deviations from perfect reproducibility are associated with non - stationary potential disorder which in turn is believed to be the main cause of the 1/f noise @xcite .",
    "the relative magnitude of the cf for a given 2d sample is determined by two factors .",
    "the first is related to the basic conductance swing @xmath3 associated with a fluctuation in the hopping regime , which is of the order of the system conductance @xmath52 this is a characteristic feature of the strongly localized regime , ( which in the present case of 2d samples means sheet resistance @xmath53 that fulfills  @xmath54 ) . in other words , for a system with size @xmath4 smaller or equal to the scale relevant for the phenomenon observed , @xmath55 is of the order unity @xcite . this should be contrasted with the ` universal ' conductance fluctuation @xmath56  characterizing the respective situation in weak localization ( which holds for @xmath57 and thus @xmath58 being the typical case@xmath59 this , incidentally is the main reason why cf ( whether due to an interference effect or an energy - shift mechanism ) , and conductance noise are much more prominent in the hopping regime than they are in the diffusive one . the second factor that controls the fluctuation amplitude",
    "@xmath55 is how many independent fluctuators the current - carrying network contains .",
    "this is essentially determined by the square root of the number of critical resistors in the sample @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the percolation radius @xcite and thus , @xmath62 .",
    "this law is depicted in figure 1c and yields @xmath63 0.3@xmath2 m ( as can be easily seen from the figure by the extrapolated value of the best fit line to @xmath64 this value for the percolation radius is quite reasonable for samples with @xmath53 in the range used ( and for @xmath65k ) .",
    "not surprisingly , a similar dependence on @xmath61 was observed for the 1/f noise magnitude @xcite .    it should be noted that @xmath61 is disorder - dependent quantity @xcite and for a fixed temperature , as is the case for the data presented here , the relative amplitude of the cf ( as well as the 1/f - noise ) increases with disorder .",
    "the relative amplitude of the memory cusp also increases with disorder @xcite making it hard to separate the electron - glass from the cf phenomenon by this parameter .",
    "the features that clearly distinguish between these phenomena are the dependence on the system size , and their different temporal behavior as demonstrated below .",
    "the glassy effects seem to be simply superimposed on the cf and noise without any noticeable intermodulation between these phenomena .",
    "for example , figure 3 demonstrates that the reproducibility of the cf is unaffected by the presence of the memory - cusp . in figure 3a",
    "we compare the @xmath8 taken immediately after cool - down with the one after the sample was allowed to relax under @xmath66v@xmath67which now includes a memory - cusp superimposed on the cf pattern . indeed , removing a ` simulated ' cusp ( figure 3b ) from the ` relaxed ' @xmath8 ,",
    "the two curves show the same degree of cf registry in the voltage region where the original cusp appeared as in the regions outside it ( figure 3c ) .",
    "while the phenomenology associated with the cf appears to have several common features with the 1/f noise , the electron - glass effects seem to be controlled by a different spatial scale , and quite a different time scale . neither the width nor the relative amplitude of the memory - cusp change when @xmath4 is decreased down to the smallest scale used in our experiments .",
    "this is in contrast with the behavior of the cf and the 1/f noise , which is also why the glassy effects become difficult to resolve below a certain scale .",
    "the huge disparity in the dynamics between the cf and the electron - glass is illustrated by the experiment described in figure 4 .",
    "starting from a relaxed state at the cool - down @xmath68 , multiple sweeps of the gate voltage over an interval straddling @xmath69 yield @xmath8 traces that clearly show that the cusp amplitude decays with time _ much _",
    "faster than the time it takes the cf pattern to change appreciably .",
    "in fact , note that for the last 3 - 4 sweeps , the amplitude of the memory - cusp has already decayed to a level comparable with the amplitude of some of the wiggles associated with the cf , which appear to be fairly stationary throughout the entire experiment .",
    "in addition to the memory cusp discussed above , essentially all the other characteristic features of the electron glass are observable in the samples that approach the mesoscopic regime .",
    "figure 5 compares the aging behavior of a 8 by 18@xmath2 m sample with that of a 1x1  mm sample both using the ` gate - protocol ' @xcite with similar parameters and similar waiting times .",
    "the same aging protocol was used involving the following procedure .",
    "the sample is allowed to relax for 12 hours at @xmath70k under a gate voltage @xmath69 reaching a near - equilibrium conductance @xmath71 ( which is used as baseline for the aging protocol )",
    ". then the gate voltage is quickly changed ( typically over 5 seconds ) from @xmath69 to @xmath72and is held there for @xmath73 after which @xmath35 is re - instated at @xmath69 .",
    "figure 5 is a plot of the excess conductance ( normalized to the equilibrium conductance @xmath74 measured after @xmath35 is set back to @xmath75 the figure shows such @xmath55 curves as function of time for different @xmath73 ( figure 5a and 5c ) .",
    "the same data are plotted as function of @xmath76 to illustrate simple - aging behavior ( figure 5b and 5d ) , which is almost identical for the ` mesoscopic ' and macroscopic sample .",
    "the only apparent difference is a more pronounced noise superimposed on the data of the small sample .    down to sample sizes of 8  @xmath6 m by 18  @xmath6 m , and for the @xmath53 values used in this study ( typically , 5 - 200  m@xmath77 at 4  k ) , the amplitude of the 1/f - noise and the cf were small enough making it possible to observe a memory - cusp and to perform a two - dip - experiment , which is one of the better defined techniques to get a measure of the glassy dynamics @xcite .",
    "the results of such an experiment is shown in figure 6 .",
    "note that the characteristic relaxation time @xmath78 as defined by the two - dip experiment , for this sample ( figure 6b ) is of order @xmath79 this is quite similar to the values typically obtained for samples of @xmath0 of millimeter size @xcite , which means that down to @xmath80 m the dynamics does not change from its macroscopic value .",
    "unfortunately , it was not feasible to perform a two - dip experiment on smaller samples because the magnitude of the cf became larger than the modulation associated with the memory - cusp .    to be able to make a systematic study of the dependence of glassy dynamics on sample size including samples smaller than @xmath27 m we resorted to the single - conductance - excitation method .",
    "this is based , as a first step , on monitoring the relaxation of the excess conductance created e.g. , by a @xmath35 switch from @xmath69 to @xmath81 .",
    "the excess conductance follows the logarithmic law @xcite : @xmath82    ( where @xmath83 is the initial amplitude of the excess conductance attained , just after @xmath35 is switched to @xmath81 ( within the experiment resolution - time @xmath84 , typically @xmath85 ) . ` ` conductance relaxation curves exhibiting the logarithmic law for sample sizes down to 8x18  @xmath6 m are illustrated in figure 7.the systematic increase of noise as the samples dimension is reduced is clearly reflected from this figure yet the @xmath86 law is reasonably well defined in these samples and may be used to get a measure of dynamics as explained below . for the 2x2@xmath2 m samples however , the 1/f - noise amplitude is often larger than @xmath83 and the relaxation process may be obscured to the degree that even the sign of @xmath87/\\partial t$ ] is in doubt.the noise for a typical 2x2@xmath2 m sample is shown in figure 8 , and in the time trace one can see time - periods during which the conductance may drift in either direction from its mean value by 2 - 4% which is comparable to the @xmath83 associated with ( macroscopic ) samples with similar parameters @xcite .",
    "due to the @xmath86 law , over 10@xmath88 - 10@xmath89 a substantial part of @xmath90 dies out , and therefore even the sign of @xmath3 versus @xmath91 becomes difficult to ascertain in this situation .",
    "two relaxation curves illustrating this unwieldy behavior of @xmath92 for typical single - runs of small sample are shown in figure 9a and 9b . apparently , the only way to get a more manageable @xmath92 in this realm of sample size is to use averaging .",
    "figure 9c shows the relaxation curve for the same 2x2@xmath2 m sample averaged over 53 individual runs that were acquired by performing multiple excitation - relaxation runs .",
    "this was realized by using two end - points for @xmath35 along the gate voltage range , and monitor the relaxation of @xmath43 at each end - point for a time @xmath93 after @xmath35 was switched from the other end - point .",
    "the two end - points @xmath94 and @xmath95 were chosen to be far enough from one another such that the voltage swing @xmath96 was considerably bigger than the width of the memory - cusp to minimize history effects @xcite .",
    "for the same reason the data used in figure 9 are limited to time - spans smaller than @xmath97 the resulting relaxation curve ( figure 9c ) , except for being still much more noisy , is quite similar to the relaxation curves of the larger samples in that it follows the logarithmic law , and with similar dynamics as is shown next .    to extract a measure of the dynamics from the @xmath98 curves such as in figures 7 and 9",
    ", one needs first to subtract the equilibrium value of @xmath9 then take into account the equilibrium field effect @xmath99 the latter is the change in @xmath43 due to the change in the thermodynamic density of states associated with the @xmath100 switch @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath101 is estimated separately for each sample using the anti - symmetric part of the field effect ( see reference @xcite for details )",
    ". then , normalizing by @xmath83 yields a logarithmic curve for @xmath102 with the boundary condition @xmath103 from which a the relaxation rate for @xmath3 is obtained as percent change per time - decade . with the above normalization",
    "this value is a proper measure of the system dynamics in that it allows comparison between different samples and/or different conditions of measurement .",
    "figure 10 summarizes the results of this procedure for samples with sizes ranging between 1x1  mm to 2x2@xmath2m@xmath23 all tested at @xmath38k@xmath23 and having similar resistances .    in principle , a similar averaging stratagem as that described above to deal with the 1/f noise problem may be employed to facilitate the observation of the memory cusp in small samples .",
    "this would entail averaging over data obtained in many quench - cooling events , each followed by a long period of relaxation ( to build up the cusp ) .",
    "such a procedure however is prone to sample damage in addition to being prohibitively time consuming .    to summarize ,",
    "we have shown in this work that the dynamics of the electron - glass has a different time and spatial scale than those associated with the mesoscopic conductance fluctuations .",
    "these conclusions are inferred from the following experimental results :    * the cf pattern is fully developed immediately after cooling the sample , while the memory - cusp amplitude takes many hours to build . * starting from a cold and well - equilibrated sample , continuously sweeping @xmath35 causes the memory - cusp amplitude to diminish with a typical time scale of hours while the cf visibility remains essentially intact for many days . * thermally cycling the sample creates a different pattern of cf while the shape and relative magnitude of the memory - cusp is the same ( as long as the average conductance of a given sample is the same ) .",
    "inasmuch as the cf pattern is taken as a snapshot of the underlying potential landscape , these findings seem to indicate that the electron - glass dynamics may be treated as essentially independent of the lattice dynamics although in terms of energy exchange ( and dissipation ) the two systems are coupled .",
    "this is not a trivial result as there is no reason to assume that the lattice potential is stationary over the time scale relevant for the electron glass .",
    "in fact , ions , atoms , and perhaps group of atoms , are presumably mobile even at cryogenic temperatures , thus producing potential fluctuations @xcite .",
    "these are believed to be the main source of the 1/f noise which includes time scales that overlap those typical of the electron glass dynamics .",
    "it is therefore plausible to expect that the two phenomena affect one another to some degree .",
    "for example , one intuitively expects that the conductance noise will be modified when the system is relaxing from an excited state ( or , more generally , when it is out of equlibrium ) . in the present case however , where @xmath3 in the excited state is typically few percents of the equilibrium conductance",
    ", this seems to be a small effect that so far escaped our detection @xcite .",
    "an attempt to find a change in the 1/f noise characteristics when the system is deliberately taken out of equilibrium yielded a null result .",
    "such an experiment was carried out by keeping the sample in an excited state for a sufficiently long time to allow adequate averaging of the noise spectrum @xcite .",
    "this steady - state , out - of - equilibrium situation was achieved by a continuous sweep of the gate voltage over a certain voltage interval .",
    "data for @xmath98 were taken after the memory - cusp was erased by allowing this process to proceed for two days .",
    "the noise characteristics were compared with those taken with a fixed - gate situation for which data were taken after the sample was allowed to relax ( and build a memory - cusp ) . in either case",
    "the noise spectrum was obtained by fourier transforming 25 conductance time - traces each composed of 1024 points taken with 1 second resolution .",
    "it turns out that , within the error of the procedure , the 1/f noise magnitude and spectrum were essentially the same for the ` near - equilibrium ' and the ` excited ' sample .",
    "full details of this experiment as well as the implications to the general issue of flicker noise in the hopping regime will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally , throughout the size - range where the memory - cusp could be resolved over the background of the cf and the 1/f noise , its amplitude and characteristic width  do not depend on sample size .",
    "likewise , the dynamics associated with conductance relaxation is independent of sample size down to 2@xmath2 m .",
    "these findings suggest that the relevant length scale for the electron glass is considerably smaller than the sample sizes used in this study .",
