    "the research on wormhole started with einstein trying to give a field representation of particles @xcite .",
    "the idea was further developed by ellis , @xcite , where instead of particles they try to model them as bridges between two regions of the space - time .",
    "later on , in the seminal morris and thorne s work @xcite , the idea of considering such solutions as connections between two separated regions of the universe , has attracted a lot of attention .    in the 80 s ,",
    "the astronomer carl sagan asked for help to physicist and turned out that the solution proposed by ellis @xcite , actually could be interpreted as the identification , the union , of two different regions .",
    "the idea of ellis is that no matter how far the two regions are , or even if those two regions were in different space - time , by means of this gluing one could just identify them , and obtain a solution which allows to go from one region to another .",
    "morris and thorne @xcite showed that these wormhole solutions need to violate the energy conditions , such type of matter is called exotic ( see @xcite for a detailed review on this subject ) .",
    "the solutions can exist but they need to be generated by matter which apparently does not exist .",
    "this is the reason why this solutions remained in the realm of fiction .",
    "however , more and more evidence was building towards the presence in our universe of unknown types of matter and energy which do not necessarily obey the energy conditions .",
    "now we know that the universe is formed by @xmath0 of dark energy .",
    "this new type of matter composes the majority in the universe and happens to be everywhere @xcite .",
    "there is now an agreement among the scientific community that matter which violates some of the energy conditions is very plausible to exit .",
    "thus , the issue that the wormholes can be rejected due to the type of matter that they need is , at least , diminished .",
    "the existence of wormholes in the universe is very interesting because they could be highways to visit stars and galaxies , otherwise it will be impossible to go enough far away to visit other worlds . of course this fact is very speculative to this stage , but no observation can discard the existence of phantom energy .",
    "nowdays we know that may be a combination of phantom and quintessence field could be the dominant component in the universe @xcite .",
    "the fact that phantom energy can be the source of wormholes @xcite-@xcite is more than exciting , and give rise to investigate about the existence of stars made of this kind of matter .",
    "maybe the mayor problem faced by the wormhole solutions is their stability .",
    "the stability problem of the bridges has been studied since the @xmath1 by penrose @xcite , in connection to the stability of the cauchy horizons .",
    "the stability of the throat of a wormhole was studied numerically by shinkay and hayward @xcite , where they show that the wormhole proposed by thorne @xcite collapses possibly towards a black hole and the throat closes , when it is perturbed by a scalar field with stress - energy tensor defined with the usual sign .",
    "they also find that the throat of the wormhole grows exponentially , when the perturbation is due to a scalar field of the same type as that making the wormhole , thus showing that the solution is highly unstable ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite it was conjectured that rotation or the magnetic field could stabilize a phantom star .",
    "the idea is that a rotating solution would have more possibilities of being stable , as well as more general static spherically symmetric solutions than the one proposed by thorne .",
    "we look for wormhole solutions which are traversable , that is , a test particle can go from one side of the throat to the other without facing large tidal forces and in a finite time .",
    "we follow the conjecture that the rotation can stabilize the wormhole , some rotating solutions were studied in the past , as an approximation @xcite or as an exact solution of the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this last solution has two main problems , it is not asymptotically flat and must be matched with a static one and it has a spherical singularity surrounding the wormhole . in this work we study the solution obtained in @xcite , it has three parameters : mass , angular momentum and scalar charge .",
    "it has also a gauge parameter which determine the radius of the throat and a naked ring singularity , exactly the same one as the kerr solution .",
    "we will show that it is possible to go though the throat going by the geodesics .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ sec : linelement ] we present the metric and give some of its limits .",
    "we also write the energy density and specialize it to the north pole , showing that from the north pole an observer measure a finite energy density , corroborating the fact that from the north pole this wormhole is traversable . in section [ sec : geodesics ]",
    "we study the geodesics .",
    "we find that the geodesics are refuse by the ring singularity ( see also @xcite ) , the easiest way to go through the throat is by the polar geodesics which can go from one part of the throat to the other side . here",
    "also we calculate the accelerations of a vector going through the throat by the polar geodesic and find that this acceleration is very weak . in section [ sec : nec ]",
    "se study the energy conditions . in section [ sec : tidal ] we analyze the tidal forces .",
    "of course the tidal forces are infinity on the ring singularity .",
    "finally we give some discussion in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a stationary and axially symmetric space - time possessing a time - like killing vector field @xmath2 , generating invariant time translations and a space - like killing vector field @xmath3 generating invariant rotations with respect to @xmath4 . the corresponding line element can be expressed in boyer - lindquist coordinates , @xmath5 where @xmath6 the line element components @xmath7 and @xmath8 read @xmath9 where the parameter @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 being @xmath12 parameters with units of distance , such that @xmath13 , that is @xmath14    in fig .",
