    "the current average of tree - level determinations of @xmath8 is @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the most precise determinations to date come from measurements of direct @xmath12 violation in @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 is a @xmath5 or @xmath6 decaying to the same final state .",
    "determinations of @xmath8 from such measurements require knowledge of the strong decay parameters of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in particular the strong - phase differences .",
    "strong - phase differences and other important parameters of multi - body @xmath14 decay , relevant to @xmath8 measurements , can be studied in quantum - correlated @xmath15 pairs produced in @xmath16 collisions at a centre - of - mass energy equal to the @xmath17 mass .",
    "the charge - conjugation quantum number @xmath18 of the initial and final states is @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , if one @xmath14 decays into a @xmath12 eigenstate such as @xmath20 this identifies the other @xmath14 to be in a state of opposite @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath12-tagged rates of decays are sensitive to the strong - phase differences required for @xmath8 measurements .",
    "furthermore , using multi - body @xmath14 decays to determine @xmath8 requires knowledge of additional parameters related to the presence of intermediate resonances ; these can also be determined from quantum - correlated @xmath14-decay data .",
    "studies of @xmath21 decays at the @xmath17 are also sensitive to the @xmath22 mixing parameters as well as the strong - phase difference between doubly cabbibo suppressed ( dcs ) and cabbibo favoured ( cf ) decays @xmath2 , which is defined by the relation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 @xcite is the absolute value of the amplitude ratio .",

    "charm mixing is described by two dimensionless parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the masses and widths , respectively , of the @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38 neutral @xmath14 meson eigenstates and @xmath39 .",
    "mixing has been probed in lifetime measurements to @xmath12-eigenstates and in dcs decays . however , when measuring mixing with the dcs decay @xmath0 the quantities measured are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "the combined result for the nine @xmath12 tagged rates is shown ; the combination is performed including systematic uncertainties and accounting for all correlations amongst the measurements .",
    "the combination of the three different constraints leads to the likelihood contours in @xmath50 and @xmath51 space shown in figure  [ fig : coherenceresults ] .",
    "the most likely values of the parameters are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "a low value of the coherence parameter is favoured .",
    "low coherence dilutes the sensitivity to @xmath8 of @xmath54 decays , however , the measurements are very sensitive to @xmath55 which is a common parameter with other @xmath56 decays . the usefulness of these constraints on @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be illustrated when they are combined with the expected yields for @xmath57 and @xmath58 at the lhcb experiment @xcite to determine @xmath8 .",
