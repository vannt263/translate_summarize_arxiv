    "in bio - informatics , comparative study of genome sequences is very important to understand evolution . in particular ,",
    "the problem of determining the minimum number of certain operations required to transform one of two given genome sequences into the other , is extensively studied .",
    "combinatorially , this problem can be formulated as sorting a given permutation ( or sequence ) to the identity permutation , by certain operations , in a minimum number of steps , called the distance between the permutation to be sorted and the identity , w.r.t .",

    "the main operations studied are the transposition  @xcite , the block - interchange  @xcite and the reversal  @xcite , or some combination of them  @xcite .    in chen and reidys",

    ", they gave a general formulation for lower bounds of the transposition and block - interchange distance from which the existing lower bounds , obtained by bafna and pevzner  @xcite , and christie  @xcite , can easily be derived .",
    "as to the reversal distance problem of signed permutations , the authors translated it into a block - interchange distance problem , by which they obtained a new lower bound  @xcite .",
    "they observe that the new lower bound gives the exact reversal distance for most of the signed permutations .",
    "this paper is mainly concerned with the reversal distances for signed permutations . a lower bound for the reversal distance",
    "was previously obtained in  @xcite by studying breakpoint graphs associated to signed permutations . in  @xcite ,",
    "a topological framework for sorting signed permutations by reversals was proposed , where the topological genera of these orientable or non - orientable @xmath0-maps associated to signed permutations give a lower bound .",
    "these two existing lower bounds are equal  @xcite .",
    "however , it was not clear which is better , compared to the lower bound in  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will present another way of associating orientable fatgraphs to signed permutations whose genera give a lower bound for the reversal distances .",
    "furthermore , we prove all these three approaches provide the same lower bound .",
    "a brief outline of the paper is as follows : in section  @xmath1 , we review the approach to study the reversal distance via plane permutations proposed in  @xcite , as well as a conjecture on skew - symmetric plane permutations to be confirmed in this paper . in section",
    "@xmath2 , from each signed permutation , we construct a fatgraph and show that the genus of the fatgraph gives a lower bound for the reversal distance of the signed permutation . in section  @xmath3 , we will show the equivalence of the lower bound on the reversal distance obtained by chen and reidys  @xcite and the lower bound obtained by bafna and pevzner  @xcite through breakpoint graphs as well as the genus bound in huang and reidys  @xcite .",
