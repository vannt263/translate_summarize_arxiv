    "what is the nature of this plume ?",
    "is it really a tidal stream associated with the ngc4435/4438 system ? if extragalactic , it would represent an extremely rare example of intracluster dust and molecular hydrogen stripped by gravitational interactions .",
    "however , the multiwavelength properties of this feature demand a little bit of attention before one can interpret it as a tidal feature .",
    "this is particularly true since the plume is detected in far - infrared , where the contamination from foreground galactic cirrus emission might be significant , if not dominant . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the two possible scenarios ( tidal stream and galactic cirrus ) in order to unveil the most likely origin of this feature .          if at the distance of the virgo cluster ( 16.5 mpc , @xcite ) , the plume would have a physical size of @xmath433 kpc ( in both right ascension and declination ) , extending up to @xmath470 kpc from ngc4438 . its hi  and co recessional velocities ( @xmath2114 @xmath5 ) are roughly consistent with the hi  velocity of ngc4438 ( @xmath30104@xmath252 and @xmath26244@xmath255 @xmath5 , @xcite ) but significantly different from the redshift of ngc4435 ( @xmath31801 @xmath5 ) .",
    "this apparently rules out a gravitational interaction between ngc4438 and ngc4435 : given their large velocity difference , we should expect the stripping material to lie at a velocity intermediate between the two systems .",
    "the plume apparently connects ngc4438 to the dwarf irregular galaxy ic3355 ( @xmath3217 @xmath5 , @xcite ) , perhaps suggesting a recent interaction between the two systems .",
    "this seems supported by the presence of a hi  tail associated with ic3355 @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to what expected in case of a fly - by encounter with ngc4438 , ic3355 s tail points to the west , thus in the opposite direction with respect to ngc4438 .",
    "moreover , it is still unclear whether or not ic3355 is really a member of the m86 cloud @xcite .",
    "thus , although we can not exclude that ic3355 is playing a role , the current data do not allow us to further investigate this hypothesis .",
    "a more plausible scenario is that the plume has been created during the collision between ngc4438 and m86 ( @xmath32244 @xmath5 ) as recently unveiled by @xcite .",
    "a complex structure of h@xmath6 filaments connects the two galaxies and spans a velocity range ( @xmath11240@xmath23 + 70 @xmath5 ) consistent with the value observed in the plume .",
    "moreover , the morphology of our feature ( i.e. , well defined edges on the east with less clear boundaries on the west side ) would be consistent with the direction of motion of ngc4438 , from west to east .",
    "the time - scale of the interaction is @xmath4100 myr @xcite , significantly shorter than the dust sputtering time - scale expected at the position of ngc4438 ( @xmath410@xmath33 yr ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , although extremely unusual , the presence of dust in the tail does not rule out the tidal scenario .    however , not all the properties of the plume are entirely consistent with a gravitation interaction .",
    "above all , its velocity width ( @xmath42 - 5 @xmath5 ) is significantly smaller than the typical values ( @xmath3420 @xmath5 ) observed in tidal tails , candidate tidal - dwarf galaxies , isolated hi  clouds and ram pressure stripped material ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although we can not exclude that the cloud is seen ` face - on ' , we consider this to be unlikely",
    ". the presence of a clear velocity gradient in the h@xmath6 filaments between m86 and ngc4438 @xcite suggests in fact that the tidal acceleration is not parallel to the plane of sky .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to imagine how a violent process such as a tidal interaction would be able to strip material along a well defined direction and to keep the velocity dispersion of the hi  cloud so small .",
    "it is therefore unclear how tidal debris can maintain such small velocity spread on a scale of a few tens of kpc .",
    "equally unusual are the uv properties of the tail .",
    "the fuv emission is in fact diffuse and not patchy with star - forming knots as observed in star - forming disks , tidal tails and extended uv disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "extraplanar diffuse uv emission is often interpreted as being due to light scattered by diffuse dust , in particular when associated with the halos of starburst galaxies ( like m82 ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the spitzer images reveal that dust is surely present in the plume , the lack of a powerful central starburst and the large distance of the tail from any strong radiation source apparently exclude the scattering scenario .",
    "thus , if extragalactic , the fuv emission must come from young stars in the plume .",
    "the absence of star - forming knots and h@xmath6 emission @xcite implies an age between @xmath410 myr ( i.e. , the lifetime of ob associations emitting in h@xmath6 ) and @xmath425 myr ( i.e. , the lifetime of b stars , supposed to be responsible for the diffuse uv light in galactic disks ; @xcite ) , significantly shorter than the time - scale of the interaction but consistent with the age of the uv tidal tail to the west of ngc4438 discovered by @xcite .",
    "this might suggest that the plume has just entered a post - starburst phase , consistent with the fact that its colour is significantly bluer than the observed colour of ngc4438 ( @xmath355.2 mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , if this is really the case , it remains unclear to us why the plume stopped forming stars .",
    "the very low velocity dispersion , the large amount of hi  and the presence of molecular hydrogen should allow the cloud to continue forming stars .",
    "moreover , the fact that co is usually associated with dense star - forming regions , even in tidal tails and stripped clouds @xcite , makes the post - starburst scenario unlikely .",
    "a completely different possibility is that the plume is in reality a galactic cirrus cloud of gas and dust just superposed by chance near ngc4435 . in this case , the diffuse fuv and optical emission would come from light scattered by the dust grains in the cloud .    before testing the cirrus hypothesis in detail",
    ", it is worthwhile to examine the probability of a cirrus cloud appearing superimposed in front of the virgo cluster . despite its high galactic latitude ( @xmath3675 ) , the center of virgo lies in a region that is significantly contaminated by cirrus emission .",
    "a ring - like cirrus structure centered near m87 and extending over several degrees @xcite is clearly visible in the iras 100@xmath0 m images ( see fig .",
    "[ uvcirrus ] , right ) . since scattered light",
    "is often associated with cirrus clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we should expect to see the same ring at both ultraviolet and optical wavelengths , though only at very low surface - brightness ( @xmath3727 - 28 mag arcsec@xmath2 ) . while deep optical data of the whole virgo region are not available , the deep and wide galex coverage of the virgo cluster makes it possible to test this hypothesis .",
    "we thus combined all the available galex pointings near the center of virgo having fuv exposure time longer than 800 sec .",
    "the mosaic is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ uvcirrus ] , and it likely represents the highest resolution large - scale map of fuv cirrus emission made to date .",
    "it clearly illustrates the presence of diffuse fuv emission tracing the distribution of far - infrared galactic cirrus emission .",
    "in addition the high spatial resolution of galex allow us to see for the first time the detailed structure of the cirrus clouds . in order to quantify the correlation between fuv and fir diffuse emission , we first removed all sources detected by sextractor @xcite and then smoothed the uv images to the resolution of the ` point - source free ' @xcite iras map ( @xmath46 arcmin ) by applying a gaussian filter .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient between the fir and uv intensity in each pixel ( 142@xmath10142 arcsec@xmath38 ) is @xmath40.82 , consistent with the range of values obtained by previous analysis of cirrus clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) . thus , there is a reasonably high probability of detecting diffuse scattered far - ultraviolet ( and perhaps also optical ) light associated with cirrus emission in the direction of the virgo cluster .",
    "more direct support to the cirrus hypothesis is provided by the properties of the plume .",
    "its negative recessional velocity , narrow velocity width and hi  column density are completely consistent with what is observed in galactic low - velocity clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the presence of co emission ( and thus of molecular hydrogen ) is commonly observed in cirrus clouds @xcite .",
    "several studies have shown that there is a good correlation between the 100@xmath0 m far - infrared intensity and the hi  column density of cirrus clouds : e.g. , @xmath390.5 - 3 mjy sr@xmath7 / 10@xmath40 cm@xmath38 @xcite . at 160@xmath0 m ,",
    "the far - infrared to hi  ratio of the plume is @xmath410 mjy sr@xmath7 / 10@xmath40 cm@xmath38 . assuming a typical 160 to 100 @xmath0 m flux ratio @xmath4 1.5 - 3 for cirrus clouds @xcite , our feature appears to have a significant far - infrared excess .",
    "this is however not inconsistent with the cirrus hypothesis since galactic ` far - infrared excess clouds ' are not rare at high galactic latitudes and , as observed in this case , they are usually associated with significant co emission @xcite .",
    "thus , the far - infrared - to - hi  ratio does not allow us to conclusively discriminate between the two proposed scenarios .",
    "this is also because our knowledge of the gas and dust content of cirrus is mainly based on studies of physical scales of tens of arcminutes , and it is not yet clear whether we can extrapolate them to the physical scale of the plume .",
    "in this letter , we have investigated the multiwavelength properties of the optical plume projected near the ngc4435/4438 system .",
    "it is very tempting to interpret this feature as tidal debris in the virgo cluster , as this would represent an extraordinary case of intracluster dust and molecular hydrogen as well as large - scale intracluster star formation .",
    "however , our analysis reveals that the dynamics , morphology , gas and dust content of this stream are more consistent with what observed in galactic cirrus clouds than in tidal features associated with cluster galaxies . whatever its real origin , this stream is a fascinating object and it clearly highlights how difficult is to discriminate between galactic clouds and extragalactic diffuse light",
    "this will be a great challenge for both far - infrared herschel surveys and deep optical investigations of the extragalactic sky .",
    "only a detailed characterization of the fuv - to - far - infrared properties of cirrus at all physical scales might eventually allow us to disentangle between the two different scenarios .",
