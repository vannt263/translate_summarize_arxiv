    "it is common knowledge that a rational agent is inclined to presuppose the existence of definite references that occur in utterances .",
    "hearing or uttering the examples below , a rational agent presupposes that the cheese , children , and car physically exist .",
    "however , day - to - day english provides an impressive number of cases when existential presuppositions are not inferred , or when they are defeated by some commonsense knowledge for a comprehensive study ) .",
    "one can explicitly speak of nonexistence  ( [ nonexistence ] ) ; events and actions that do not occur  ( [ not occur ] ) ; existence at other times  ( [ other times ] ) ; or fictional and imaginary objects  ( [ fictions ] ) .",
    "note that the simple dichotomy found in most approaches to presupposition between existent and nonexistent objects is not enough for a full account of natural language expressiveness .",
    "the study of presuppositions is primarily a study of commitment  commitment to the existence of presupposed definite referents or to the truth of factive complements .",
    "the reduction of presupposition to entailment is inadequate because presuppositions are _ implied _ , not _ specified _ ; they are not part of the truth conditions of natural language sentences , and they can be cancelled in negative environments . trying to explain the whole phenomenon and to provide solutions for the projection problem ,",
    "linguists have often omitted any explanation for the existential commitment of definite references or their explanation has been a superficial one .",
    "similarly , philosophers who have studied existence and nonexistence have been more concerned with providing formal tools for manipulation of nonexistent objects than tools to capture our commonsense commitment .",
    "this puts us in a difficult position . from a linguistic perspective",
    ", the literature provides a good set of theories able to more or less explain the commitment to the presupposed truth of factives and the like but not the existential commitment of definite references . from a philosophical perspective",
    ", we have quite a few theories which deal with existence and nonexistence , but they too offer no explanation for existential commitment .    our aim here is to provide a formalism that has the strength of both perspectives .",
    "we achieve this using the following :    * a set of methodological principles that unify meinong s   philosophy with grice s   conversational principles ; * a rich ontology in the style of hirst  , which provides the possibility of having consistent models that contain objects belonging to different ontological spaces ; * an extension of stratified logic  @xcite where the quantifiers are read under lejewski s   `` unrestricted interpretation '' , which provides us the formal tool for expressing the above layers .",
    "the implementation relies on an extension of the beth semantic tableaux to stratified logic .",
    "the code is written in common lisp and makes extensive use of the nondeterministic facilities of the screamer system  @xcite .",
    "we first review the philosophical approaches in studying existence and nonexistence and the linguistic approaches in studying presuppositions , emphasizing their ( in)ability to deal with presuppositions and nonexistence respectively .",
    "we give a brief introduction to stratified logic , its implementation , and explain the methodological principles of our approach . in section 4",
    "we show how this approach is able not only to deal with nonexistence but also able to explain the existential commitment of definite reference .",
    "the rest of the paper is dedicated to a comparison with parsons s and hobbs s work .",
    "early works of frege   and russell   tackled a very small subset of what today is labelled with the name `` presupposition '' : the presuppositions introduced by definite references and proper names .",
    "hirst   shows that classical logic , which embeds quine s metaphysical view  @xcite that `` everything exists '' , is not able to deal adequately with nonexistent objects .",
    "for example , if one knows that dragons do not exist  @xmath0  it is impossible to distinguish between _ my dragon has blue eyes _ and _ my dragon does not have blue eyes _ because both translations in first - order logic are false : @xmath1has\\_blue\\_eyes(x))$ ] .",
    "therefore , first - order logic is doomed to fail in any attempt to reflect the presuppositions of definite references .    several approaches to nonexistence rely on meinong s _ mental act _ philosophy  @xcite .",
    "for example , parsons   avoids russell s paraphrase of the definite description by using the predicate @xmath2 . for parsons",
    ", @xmath3 refers to the unique object that satisfies @xmath4 if there is such an object .",
    "otherwise , it does not refer to anything at all . for a sentence such as ``",
    "the man in the doorway is clever '' , parsons   argues that the translation @xmath5 is not adequate because it does not reflect our commitment to the man s existence .",
    "therefore , he proposes that the translation should be @xmath6 where @xmath2 is the existential predicate .",
    "but the problem with this is that it embeds the existential commitment in the logical translation  not as something that is `` implied '' or presupposed , but as something `` said '' or specified .",
    "this is not the case with linguistic presuppositions .",
    "thus , the first translation is too weak  unable to capture the commitment , and the second one is too strong  the commitment becomes part of the translation and leaves no room for cancellation of presupposition .",
    "outside meinong s world , we find other approaches that focus on the appropriate reading of the quantifiers .",
    "lejewski   and hintikka   both propose an `` unrestricted interpretation '' of the quantifiers , which makes no commitment to the existence of the objects over which they range . under this interpretation ,",
    "existence can be predicated ( lejewski ) , or explicitly captured as @xmath7 ( hintikka ) .",
    "the latter solution is nothing but a translation into logic of quine s slogan , `` to exist is to be the value of a variable '' . in these universes , we are free now to talk about pegasus and dragons but we can not explain our commitment to the existence of the definite referents .",
    "an interesting approach towards explaining the conditions in which existential presuppositions are generated is built by atlas   around the notions of `` aboutness '' and `` noun - phrase topicality '' .",
    "instead of allowing all the noun - phrases in a sentence to exhibit presupposition generation capabilities , only the topical ones enjoy this property .",
    "atlas gives no hint of how this theory could be extended to deal with factives or verbs of judging , and defining the notions of aboutness and topicality for them is not trivial .",
    "even if we did manage to do this , such presuppositions can never be cancelled .",
    "either they are generated or they are not .",
    "this leads us to believe that sentences such as _ john did nt stop beating the rug because he never started _ can not be captured in this manner .",
    "[ hobbs1 ]    hobbs   uses the `` unrestricted interpretation '' of the quantifiers introduced by lejewski  .",
    "hence , in hobbs s framework , the set of things we can talk about ( including , therefore , nonexistent things ) and the set of things we quantify over are equal .",
    "the existential commitment is captured by a set of `` transparency axioms '' .",
    "for example , the sentence _ ross worships zeus _ is represented as :    @xmath8 the first conjunct says that @xmath9 is the event of worshipping zeus by ross , and the second says that @xmath9 exists in the real world .",
    "hobbs assigns a _ transparency _ property to the predicates . for @xmath10 ,",
    "this property entails the existence of its second argument in the physical world : @xmath11    apparently , the commitment to ross s existence is solved .",
    "@xmath12 is transparent in its second argument but not in its third ; so we may infer that ross is existent , but draw no conclusions about zeus .",
    "the problem is that the transparency axioms are associated with the predicates and not with the objects , so that there is no criterion to choose an appropriate translation for a sentence like _ the king of buganda worships zeus _ because the translation should be transparent if we know nothing about buganda and opaque otherwise .",
    "the vast majority of the linguistic approaches are more concerned with `` how presuppositions are inherited '' than with `` what presuppositions are '' .",
    "presuppositions are defined in terms of _ plugs , holes , _ and _ filters _",
    "@xcite , consistency  @xcite , uncontroversiality  @xcite , or hypothetical and secondary contexts  @xcite , but nothing is said about the logical framework into which they may be expressed .",
    "an exception is mercer s approach  .",
    "he abandons the projection method in favour of rules of inference in default logic .",
    "our main objection is to mercer s use of natural disjunction as an exclusive disjunction , and the reduction of natural implication to logical equivalence .",
    "mercer   argued that this is a consequence of the way he intended his `` proof by cases '' , in which `` the cases are taken from a conjunctive statement , where the conjuncts are the disjuncts in a classical proof '' .",
    "he assumes that this non - standard notion is the one that must be used in nonmonotonic reasoning .",
    "but this non - traditional analysis and the reduction of natural implication to logical equivalence are not representable within the logic itself .",
    "hence , this method is also a procedural one .",
    "a different perspective is given by sandt   and zeevat   for whom presuppositions are understood as anaphoric expressions that have internal structure and semantic content . because they have more semantic content than other anaphors , presuppositions are able to create an antecedent in the case that the discourse does not provide one .",
    "van der sandt provides a computational method for presupposition resolution in an enhanced discourse representation theory , while zeevat gives a declarative account for it using update semantics , but neither of the methods is able to accommodate the cancellation of presupposition that is determined by information added later to the discourse .",
    "a simple ontology consisting only of existent and nonexistent objects is inadequate for dealing with fictions or objects that have unactualized existence .",
    "therefore , sentences such as _ sherlock holmes is smarter than any other detective _ or _ the strike was averted _ can not be represented in their theories .",
    "stratified logic  @xcite reflects a different understanding of default reasoning phenomena from that found in the classic literature  @xcite . instead of treating the notion of defeasibility on consistency and justification - based grounds",
    ", we conjecture that defeasible inferences are `` weaker '' than classical entailments . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "it is enough to consider only a subset of stratified logic .    in first - order stratified logic ,",
    "a stratified interpretation @xmath13 consists of an universe of objects @xmath14 and a function mapping @xmath15 as in first - order logic , but the relation set is partitioned according to the strength ( undefeasible and defeasible relations ) and polarity ( positive and negative relations ) .",
    "thus , the set of relations @xmath16 will be given by the union @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for positive undefeasible relations , @xmath19 for negative undefeasible relations , @xmath20 for positive defeasible relations , and @xmath21 for negative defeasible relations .",
    "positive atomic formulas and negative ( negated ) atomic formulas are labelled as defeasible ( e.g. @xmath22 ) or undefeasible ( e.g. @xmath23 ) and compound formulas are obtained from positive and negative atomic formulas using classical logical connectors . for example , one would formalize that uttering that _ john does not regret that mary came to the party _ presupposes that _ mary came to the party _ as @xmath24 because _ mary came to the party _ is defeasible : _ john does not regret that mary came to the party because she did not come_.    at the semantic level , we extend the notion of satisfiability to the two levels we have introduced ; hence , we will have _ u - satisfiability _",
    ", @xmath25 , and _ d - satisfiability _ , @xmath26 .",
    "[ xentailsfol ] assume @xmath27 is an @xmath28 valuation such that @xmath29 and assume that @xmath28 maps @xmath30-ary predicates @xmath31 to relations @xmath32 .",
    "for any atomic formula @xmath33 , and any stratified valuation @xmath27 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are terms , the x - satisfiability relations are defined as follows :    * @xmath36 iff @xmath37 * @xmath38 iff @xmath39 * @xmath40 iff @xmath41 * @xmath42 iff @xmath43    for any negation of an atomic formula @xmath44 , and any stratified valuation @xmath27 , where @xmath45 and @xmath35 are terms , the x - satisfiability relations are defined as follows :    * @xmath46 iff @xmath47 * @xmath48 iff @xmath49 * @xmath50 iff @xmath51 * @xmath52 iff @xmath51    the _ x - satisfiability _",
    "relation for compound formulas is defined in the usual way .",
    "one can see that this definition of satisfiability has two major advantages : on one hand , the @xmath25 relation provides a high degree of liberty in satisfying sets of formulas that contain positive and negative information of different strengths ; on the other hand the @xmath26 relation is able to signal when such a contradiction occurs .",
    "for example , in accordance with the above definition , the theory @xmath53 is _ u - satisfiable _ but is not _",
    "d - satisfiable_. that means defeasible and undefeasible information are allowed to co - exist because the satisfiability relations are able to handle them appropriately .",
    "stratified logic uses an extension of semantic tableaux that is both sound and complete to compute the models associated with a given theory . on a set of model schemata",
    ", we define a partially ordered relation ( @xmath54 ) that yields the _ most optimistic _",
    "schemata for the theory , i.e. , those that contain more information and whose information is as defeasible as possible . for example , a translation in stratified logic of the classical example involving tweety ( represented by the constant @xmath55 ) will yield three model schemata .",
    "schema @xmath56 does not cancel the fact that tweety flies as schema @xmath57 does .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 contains more information than @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 is the most optimistic model schema .",
    "@xmath59    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "one can notice that the existential presupposition is now cancelled by some background knowledge .",
    "the only way one can satisfy the initial theory is if she has a stratified structure where @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the theory yields one model @xmath61    asserting existence or nonexistence affects _",
    "defeasible inferences _ due to knowledge of language use and restricts some of the models .",
    "if someone utters _ the king of buganda exists _ and we know nothing about buganda , the translation @xmath62 gives one model : @xmath63 if we _ know _ that the king of buganda does not exist , or in other words we evaluate the above sentence against a knowledge base that contains @xmath64 there is no model for this theory , so the utterance is interpreted as false .",
    "it is noteworthy that the inconsistency appears due to specific knowledge about the king s physical existence and not because of a quantification convention as in classical first - order logic . on the other hand ,",
    "the negation , _ the king of buganda does not exist _ ,",
    "is consistent with the knowledge base and provides this model : @xmath65    so far , we have emphasized the way presuppositions of definite references can be handled in this framework .",
    "however , the proposed method is general in the sense that it captures the other presuppositional environments as well .",
    "moreover , the cancellation can occur at any moment in discourse .",
    "consider for example the utterance _ john does not regret that mary came to the party_. its formalization in stratified logic follows : @xmath66 the optimistic model computed by our program is this : @xmath67 this model reflects our intuitions that _ mary came to the party _ and all definite references exist .",
    "if one utters now _ of course he does nt .",
    "mary did not come to the party _ , the new model computed by our program will reflect the fact that a presupposition has been cancelled , even though this cancellation occurred later in the discourse .",
    "thus , the new optimistic model will be this : @xmath68    our approach correctly handles references to unactualized objects such as averted strikes or the paper that we had wanted to submit to aaai-94 .",
    "the utterance _ the strike was averted _ can be formalized thus : @xmath69 this gives one optimistic model : @xmath70",
    "parsons argues that is impossible to distinguish between the shape of the logical form of two sentences like these , in which one subject is fictional and the other is real :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\a .",

    "a complete theory for the first sentence is this : @xmath71 this theory gives only one model : @xmath72 this corresponds to an object @xmath73 that does not exist in the real world but exists as a fiction , has the property of being sherlock holmes , and for any other object @xmath74 , real or fictional that has the property of being a detective , the object @xmath73 is more famous than object @xmath74 .",
    "of course , in this model , it is impossible to commit ourselves to holmes s physical existence , but is possible to talk about him .",
    "the theory for the second sentence is this : @xmath75 this theory exhibits one optimistic model : @xmath76 model @xmath77 states that the object @xmath73 , being pel , exists in a defeasible sense and this is the existential presupposition of the initial utterance .    as seen , it is needless to mention the existence of specific objects in the knowledge base .",
    "the model - ordering relation rejects anyhow models that are not optimistic . in this way",
    ", the commitment to pel s existence is preserved , and appears as a presupposition of the utterance .",
    "parsons s theory provides different logical forms for the above sentences , but fails to avoid the commitment to nonexistent objects .",
    "we have mentioned that hobbs s transparency pertains to relations and not to objects . in our approach ,",
    "a sentence such as _ ross worships zeus _ can be satisfied by a set of semantic models that correspond to each possible combination of the existence and non - existence of ross and zeus .",
    "@xmath78 among them , only one is minimal : the one that explains the commitment to both ross s and zeus s existence . @xmath79",
