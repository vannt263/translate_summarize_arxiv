    "the kinetics of phase ordering in alloys , following a rapid temperature quench below the coexistence curve , has traditionally attracted much interest , both in the physics and material science communities @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the temporal growth of ordered domains , as measured , e.g. , via a time - dependent structure factor , exhibits universal features , such as characteristic growth exponents and dynamic scaling , in analogy to critical phenomena .",
    "the `` inverse '' problem , i.e. the bulk _ disordering _ of a system after a rapid _ increase _ in temperature or in response to highly mobile defects , is also an interesting problem , occurring in the context of erosion or corrosion phenomena @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is a testing ground for a fundamental question of statistical physics , namely , how a system approaches its final steady state , starting from an initial _ non - stationary _ condition .    in most real solids , microscopic atom - atom exchanges",
    "are mediated by defects , such as vacancies or interstitial sites @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to describe such processes with the help of a three - state model , allowing for two species of atoms and a certain number of empty ( defect ) sites @xcite .",
    "vacancy concentrations are typically extremely small ( of the order of @xmath0 ) . as a first step towards a deeper understanding of disordering dynamics",
    ", we will neglect any asymmetries in the microscopics of the two atom species , leaving them for consideration at a later stage @xcite .",
    "thus , our study will be based on an ising model with a very small admixture of empty sites , namely a _ single _",
    "vacancy , undergoing an `` _ upquench _ '' from _ zero _ to _ infinite _ temperature .",
    "since we wish to describe particles and holes , the dynamics will conserve the number of each species separately .",
    "only particle - hole exchanges will be permitted , in order to model the vacancy mechanism .",
    "we should note for completeness that a number of investigations have focused on _ downquenches _ in similar models , i.e. , vacancy - mediated domain growth @xcite .",
    "an alternate view of our study addresses the effect of a random walker on its background medium .",
    "each step of the walker displaces part of the background , leaving tracks like a beach comber in the sand .",
    "these tracks can be monitored and display their own dynamics . in the simplest case @xcite ,",
    "the walker is a brownian vacancy , exploring a lattice filled with particles of two species , labelled as `` black '' and `` white '' , or `` up '' and `` down '' spins . starting from a perfectly phase - segregated state , three distinct temporal regimes are observed , separated by two crossover times . during the late stages of this process",
    ", the number of broken bonds exhibits dynamic scaling , characterized by a set of exponents and a scaling function .",
    "a mean - field theory allows for the analytic calculation of these features , in excellent agreement with simulations @xcite .    in order to test the range of universality of this model ,",
    "we extend these studies to the case of a _ biased _ random walker : the vacancy or defect hops preferentially along one of the lattice directions , as if subject to gravity . in the language of electrostatics , the defect is charged , disordering an initial configuration of neutral atoms in the presence of an electric field .",
    "we emphasize that this is _ completely equivalent _ to having a neutral ( or less massive ) vacancy in a background of particles , all of which carry the _ same _ charge ( or larger mass ) . as in the unbiased case ,",
    "there is no _ feedback _ from the background to the defect , i.e. , the motion of the vacancy is independent of the local background configuration .",
    "however , the choice of boundary conditions along the direction of the field now becomes important : we will consider two cases , one in which spatial inhomogeneities persist in the long - time limit , and another which approaches a homogeneous steady state .",
    "intriguingly , in both cases the three temporal regimes noted before are still clearly observable . our key goal is to explore to what extent scaling functions and exponents are _ universal _ ,",
    "i.e. , independent of boundary conditions and bias .",
    "employing exact results , a mean - field theory and monte carlo simulations , we find that the scaling _ exponents _ are completely _ universal _ , but that the scaling _ functions _ can depend sensitively on the boundary conditions , through a new scaling variable which involves the bias .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define our model , discuss the associated boundary conditions and introduce control parameters and observables of interest .",
    "we then turn to our findings . in section iii , we set the scene by characterizing the final steady states which are exactly known . on the basis of monte carlo data ,",
    "we then demonstrate the emergence of three temporal regimes and the separation of time scales between them .",
    "this observation forms the basis of a mean - field theory , to be introduced in section v. its scaling predictions are compared to detailed monte carlo simulations in the following section .",
    "we conclude with some comments and open questions .",
    "we begin by summarizing the discrete model underlying the monte carlo simulations .",
    "it is defined on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice of dimensions @xmath1 . each lattice site",
    "is denoted by a pair of integers , @xmath2 , and can be occupied by either a black particle , a white particle or a vacancy .",
    "multiple occupancy is forbidden .",
    "thus the configurations of the model can be described by a set of spin variables @xmath3 which can take three values : @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) for a black ( white ) particle , and @xmath6 for a vacancy . to model the _ minute _ concentrations of vacancies in real systems , we focus on the case of a _ single _ hole .",
    "the number of black @xmath7 and white @xmath8 particles is conserved and equal : @xmath9 @xcite . in the conclusions , we return briefly to the question of higher vacancy concentrations .",
    "the initial configuration is perfectly phase - segregated : black and white particles each fill one half of the system , with a sharp flat interface between them , chosen to lie horizontally along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the vacancy is located at the interface . even though this structure is that of a ferromagnetically ordered state , the details of the particle - particle interactions are not important , since we will be interested in upquenches to infinite temperature , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the vacancy moves independently of its local environment .",
    "however , it is subject to a bias @xmath12 , aligned _ transverse _ to the initial interface , i.e. , upwards along the ( positive ) @xmath13-axis .",
    "this is of course equivalent to the particles experiencing an external gravitational or electric field pointing along @xmath14 .",
    "we stress that a factor @xmath15 has been absorbed into the parameter @xmath12 ; i.e. , we are considering the _ high - temperature , high - field limit _ of a more complex interacting system .    at each monte carlo time step ( mcs ) ,",
    "one of the four nearest neighbors of the vacancy is chosen at random .",
    "the exchange is performed using metropolis @xcite rates : @xmath16 , modelling a _",
    "local _ electrostatic or gravitational potential . here , @xmath17 is the change in the @xmath13-coordinate of the vacancy , in units of the lattice constant @xmath18 .",
    "thus , moves _ against _ the field are exponentially suppressed while all others are accepted .",
    "no particle - particle exchanges are allowed .",
    "next , we specify the boundary conditions . in combination with the bias , they determine whether any spatial inhomogeneities survive in the long - time limit , with potential consequences for scaling exponents or functions . in the unbiased case ,",
    "the stationary state is completely uniform @xcite , and the choice of boundary conditions affects at most nonuniversal amplitudes . to test the effect of spatial inhomogeneities , we consider two scenarios , namely , reflecting ( also referred to as `` brick wall '' , bwbc ) or periodic ( pbc ) boundary conditions for the top and bottom edges .",
    "the right and left boundaries , being aligned with the drive , are not expected to play a significant role ; we choose them to be periodic in both cases .",
    "these two scenarios differ in two important respects .",
    "first , reflecting boundary conditions allow some spatial inhomogeneities to persist , while periodic boundary conditions lead to homogeneous distributions .",
    "second , we will see in the next section that , under bwbc , the system approaches an_equilibrium _ state in which all transport currents have subsided .",
    "in contrast , periodic boundary conditions are incompatible with a global hamiltonian , so that the steady state is a _ non - equilibrium _ one , carrying a net mass current .",
    "the two control parameters for the monte carlo simulations will be the field strength , @xmath12 , and the system size , @xmath19 . to monitor the evolution of the system ,",
    "we measure a `` disorder parameter '' , namely , the number of broken bonds ( i.e. , black - white nearest - neighbor pairs ) , @xmath20 @xcite , as a function of time @xmath21 .",
    "more detailed information is carried by the local hole and magnetization densities , defined respectively as @xmath22 here , @xmath23 denotes the configurational average .",
    "the kronecker-@xmath24 ensures that lattice site @xmath25 is the one occupied by the vacancy .",
    "non - zero values of @xmath26 indicate an _ excess _ of white or black particles at lattice site @xmath25 , which is also a sensitive measure of the disordering process .",
    "the full time dependence of these densities can in general only be computed within a mean - field approach .",
    "however , their stationary forms are easily found from the known steady - state distributions , as we will presently see .",
    "we finally note that , for the analytic part of our work , it is straightforward to generalize our model to @xmath27 dimensions : denoting a lattice site by @xmath28 , the field selects a _ one - dimensional _",
    "subspace , with reflecting or periodic boundary conditions , along the @xmath13-direction .",
    "the @xmath29-dimensional transverse subspace retains periodic boundaries .",
    "an exact solution of our model involves knowledge of the full time - dependent distributions , @xmath30 , for the probability of finding configuration @xmath3 at time @xmath21 .",
    "this requires finding _ all _ eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the underlying master equation : @xmath31p(\\{\\sigma _ { { \\bf r}}^{\\prime } \\},t)-w[\\{\\sigma _ { { \\bf r}}\\}|\\{\\sigma _ { { \\bf r}}^{\\prime } \\}]p(\\{\\sigma _ { { \\bf r}}\\},t)\\right\\ } \\text { . } \\label{master}\\ ] ] here , @xmath32 $ ] denotes the transition rate , per unit time , from configuration @xmath3 into a new configuration @xmath33 which may differ only by one vacancy hop . in discrete time , it is just the metropolis rate specified above .",
    "even though eqn ( [ master ] ) is only linear in the probabilities , a complete solution is usually feasible only for systems which are either very small ( @xmath34 ) or restricted to one dimension .",
    "both cases are only of limited interest here .",
    "however , it is often possible to determine a particular eigenvector , namely the one associated with the ( non - degenerate ) eigenvalue zero : this provides us with the _ stationary limits _ , @xmath35 , of the full distributions .",
    "this procedure is particularly simple for the case of brick wall ( reflecting ) boundary conditions . here",
    ", we can immediately write down the internal energy ( the `` hamiltonian '' ) of the system , being the electrostatic energy of a single charge in a uniform electric field . thus , @xmath36 $ ] is just the associated equilibrium boltzmann factor . since interparticle interactions are restricted to the excluded volume constraint",
    ", @xmath37 is `` color - blind '' , i.e. , it gives equal weight to all configurations of _ particles _ at _ fixed _ vacancy position .",
    "of course , any additional interactions could easily be incorporated into the hamiltonian .",
    "in contrast , the toroidal geometry of periodic boundary conditions , in combination with a uniform drive , prevents the existence of a global , _ time - independent _ potential .",
    "therefore , the steady state is far from equilibrium . yet fortunately , the stationary distribution is still exactly known @xcite and even simpler : @xmath37 is _ completely _ uniform , giving equal weight to _ all _ configurations of vacancy _ and _ particles . in this case , however , it is entirely unknown how to generalize this solution to more complex interparticle interactions .    given the stationary distributions , the steady - state _ densities _ , defined via @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are easily computed . for reflecting boundary conditions , @xmath40 is spatially _ inhomogeneous _ , following the usual exponential profile .",
    "since the steady state is color - blind , the magnetization density is uniform . for simplicity ,",
    "we place the coordinate origin into the center of the system .",
    "thus ,    @xmath41    where the normalization @xmath42 $ ] ensures that the system contains only one vacancy .",
    "the second equation just reflects the fact that there are equal numbers of positive and negative particles @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy , and may not be entirely trivial at first sight , that the inhomogeneities in @xmath43 leave no trace at all in the magnetization distribution .",
    "the corresponding results for periodic boundary conditions are even simpler : @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is also uniform , reflecting a single vacancy in a system of @xmath46 sites .",
    "finally , the saturation value for the number of broken bonds is readily found , since the particle configurations in the steady state are completely random .",
    "since each of the four types of particle - particle bonds is equally likely , to leading order in @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath48 \\text { .}\\ ] ] the corrections include surface terms which distinguish the boundary conditions : for bwbc , we find @xmath49 while the leading correction for pbc is only @xmath50 .",
    "the vacancy plays an even smaller role since it affects only @xmath51 bonds : this contribution is neglected here .",
    "having established the key features of the steady state , we now turn to simulation results .",
    "our aim in this section is to motivate the key ingredient which will be required for most of our mean - field results , namely , that the vacancy equilibrates on a much faster time scale than the particles .",
    "since this observation will be based on monte carlo data , we first summarize the parameters of our numerical work .",
    "we have performed detailed simulations of our model , using two - dimensional square lattices with @xmath19 ranging from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "the lattice constant @xmath18 is set to @xmath54 .",
    "both types of boundary conditions , reflecting and periodic , have been implemented . for reflecting boundary conditions",
    ", the external field varies between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "larger values of @xmath12 or @xmath19 equilibrate too slowly for our computational resources . for periodic boundary conditions",
    ", equilibration takes place much faster , and therefore , @xmath12 varies between @xmath55 and @xmath57 .",
    "our data are averaged over @xmath58 realizations , depending on the desired accuracy .",
    "the length of the runs varies with system size , up to a maximum of @xmath59 mcs .",
    "epsf    = = 1.5    @xmath55 mcs    = = 1.5    @xmath60 mcs    = = 1.5    @xmath61 mcs    = = 1.5    @xmath62 mcs    = = 1.5    @xmath63 mcs    = = 1.5    @xmath64 mcs    to obtain a visual impression of the disordering process , fig .",
    "1 shows the evolution of a typical configuration , in a @xmath65 lattice with @xmath66 and brickwall boundary conditions .",
    "the initial interface , completely smooth at @xmath67 , begins to break up as increasing numbers of particles are transported into the oppositely colored half of the system .",
    "eventually , the system becomes completely disordered .",
    "clearly , the number of broken bonds , @xmath20 , is a suitable quantitative measure for the growing disorder , shown in fig .  2 for the same set of system parameters .",
    "epsf    = = .85    similar to the unbiased case @xcite , it clearly exhibits three regimes , drawn schematically in the inset : an _ early _ regime ( i ) , an _",
    "intermediate _ regime ( ii ) , and a _ late _ or _ saturation _ regime ( iii ) in which the system has reached steady state . as the system size increases , the intermediate regime spans a widening time range , suggesting that the three regimes are temporally well separated . in practice , this is already the case for @xmath68 .",
    "this separation of time scales is also observed for larger values of the bias .",
    "physically , the three regimes are characterized as follows . for _ early _ times ( regime i )",
    ", the vacancy is still localized in the vicinity of its starting point .",
    "given the properties of random walks , this regime is expected to depend strongly on the dimensionality .",
    "after a time of @xmath69 ) , however , the vacancy has explored the whole system and is effectively equilibrated .",
    "this marks the onset of the _ intermediate _ regime .",
    "in contrast , the particle distribution is still strongly inhomogeneous , equilibrating only upon entering the _ saturation _ regime .",
    "a completely analogous picture emerges for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our goal in the following is to test for dynamic scaling .",
    "since our data involve the three variables @xmath19 , @xmath12 and @xmath21 , as well as two types of boundary conditions , the appropriate scaling forms may not be a priori obvious .",
    "we shall therefore first consider an analytic approach , before turning to a detailed comparison with the data .",
    "since an exact solution of the full master equation is not available , we seek a simpler formulation of the dynamics . for our purposes , a set of equations of motion for the two conserved densities , @xmath43 and @xmath70 , provides a suitable starting point .",
    "we immediately focus on the @xmath27-dimensional case .",
    "a _ spatially _ _ discrete _ version of the desired equations is easily obtained from the master equation , via the definition ( [ dens ] ) . not surprisingly , the excluded volume interaction mixes correlation functions of different orders , generating the usual bbgky hierarchy . to obtain a closed set of equations , a _",
    "mean - field _",
    "approximation is required : higher correlations are approximated by products of appropriate single - point averages .",

    "the right - hand sides are the ( negative ) gradients of the associated hole and magnetization currents . in the field - free limit @xmath78 , these are just the results of ref . @xcite .",
    "of course , the bias induces additional terms which reflect systematic ohmic currents : since particles can only move when the vacancy is present , the extra _ magnetization _ current , @xmath79 , is proportional to @xmath43 .",

    "current @xmath80 is independent of the local particle background , as one should have expected .",

    "several values of @xmath12 are plotted , for @xmath157 .",
    "as anticipated , the mixing process proceeds more slowly for larger values of @xmath12 , since these tend to confine the vacancy more strongly to the upper edge ( @xmath158 ) of the system .",
    "the corresponding scaling plot is shown in fig .",
    "6b : here , several values of @xmath19 and @xmath12 are chosen such that @xmath159 remains _",
    "constant_. the data collapse in the intermediate and late regimes lends full support to our prediction , eqn ( [ ascalbw ] ) .    focusing on the intermediate regime ( @xmath160 ) , figs . 5b and 6b show very clearly that the disorder parameter increases as a _ power law _",
    "there , @xmath161 .",
    "since this behavior persists over at least three decades , we can extract a reliable numerical estimate for the exponent , resulting in @xmath162 for both reflecting and for periodic boundary conditions , in agreement with our prediction .",
    "our results so far can be summarized more succinctly .",
    "defining a set of characteristic exponents and scaling functions , the scaling of the disorder parameter , for both types of boundary conditions , can by written as @xmath163 remarkably , we find that the _ exponents _ @xmath164 and @xmath165 are _ universal _ ,",
    "i.e. , independent of boundary conditions and drive .",
    "our results , @xmath166 which is exact and @xmath167 which follows from our mean - field theory , are completely consistent with the monte carlo data and agree with the corresponding exponents for the unbiased case @xcite . the short - time behavior can be written as @xmath168 with a `` growth '' exponent @xmath141 which is also manifestly universal .",
    "the additional exponent @xmath169 is related to the others via the consistency condition @xmath170 , whence @xmath171 .",
    "this scaling law is obviously satisfied by our results .",
    "in contrast to the exponents , the scaling _ functions _ @xmath172 and @xmath173 are profoundly affected by the bias and the boundary conditions . for pbc",
    ", we just recover the results of the unbiased case , whereas a nontrivial dependence on a new scaling variable , @xmath81 , emerges in the brick wall case .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the vacancy - mediated disordering of a binary alloy , in response to an upquench from zero to infinite temperature .",
    "the system is placed in a gravitational or electric field , and two types of boundary conditions , reflecting ( `` brick wall '' ) and periodic , are studied . starting from a perfectly phase - segregated initial configuration , the vacancy mediates atom exchanges , leading to fully disordered _ exactly known _ final states . for brickwall boundary conditions , the final state is an _ equilibrium _ one , characterized by a boltzmann distribution and an exponential hole density profile .",
    "in contrast , the steady state established by periodic boundary conditions is a _ non - equilibrium _ one , with homogeneous configurational distribution and profiles . using monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we monitor the time evolution of the system by measuring local profiles and a disorder parameter , i.e. , the number of broken bonds . for both types of boundary conditions ,",
    "three temporal regimes are identified : an early one , where the vacancy has not reached the boundaries of the system , an intermediate one in which the vacancy has already equilibrated , but the particle distributions are still inhomogeneous , and a late regime where the system has reached steady state .",
    "to predict scaling exponents and scaling functions , we develop a theoretical description in terms of a set of mean - field equations of motion for the local densities . invoking the separation of time scales ,",
    "the mean - field equations can be solved exactly in the intermediate and late time regimes , providing us with explicit expressions for the observables of interest .",
    "we find that the disorder parameter exhibits dynamic scaling and observe excellent agreement of monte carlo data and mean - field predictions .",
    "our key result is a set of _ universal scaling exponents _ , independent of bias and boundary conditions .",
    "for example , in all cases the number of broken bonds increases as @xmath174 , before saturating at a value of @xmath175 .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "the scaling _ functions _ for the disorder parameter exhibit a _ lesser _ degree of universality : while they remain independent of the bias in the case of periodic boundary conditions , an additional scaling variable , @xmath81 , must be taken into account for reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "this variable also controls the shape of the excess density ( magnetization ) profile .",
    "so far , we have restricted our attention to systems containing only a single vacancy . however , in real systems , one should expect that the number of vacancies , @xmath176 , scales with system size @xcite . for generality ,",
    "we introduce the _ vacancy number exponent _ @xmath177 , with @xmath178 , so that @xmath179 .",
    "thus , @xmath180 describes a situation where the vacancies ( `` defects '' ) prefer the interfacial region before the upquench occurs .",
    "our previous results correspond to the case @xmath181 but are easily extended .",
    "we simply need to modify the normalization condition for the hole density profile , eqn ( [ norm ] ) , so that the constant @xmath90 , given in eqn ( [ c ] ) , becomes @xmath182 $ ] . as a consequence , the late crossover time , eqn ( [ lct ] ) , now scales as @xmath183 , so that @xmath184 and @xmath185 . of course , these exponents are again universal .",
    "we conclude by noting the different symmetries which characterize the bwbc and the pbc case , in the _ presence _ of the bias .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are compatible with translation invariance , but violate the detailed balance condition : the driving force is not compensated by a chemical potential gradient .",
    "in contrast , detailed balance holds for reflecting boundary conditions , but translation invariance is broken .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the scaling exponents remain unaffected by such profound differences in symmetry .",
    "we would like to thank s. redner for asking a pertinent question which led to this work .",
