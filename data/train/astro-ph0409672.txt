    "this result has frequently been confirmed since and has lead many to suggest that those stars have the cosmological li abundance .    in stellar evolution models",
    "however , one must include all physical processes that follow from first principles , including gravitational settling which leads to a reduction in the surface li abundance ; deeper in , nuclear reactions destroy li .",
    "this combination , together with the similarity of the li concentration in stars of different @xmath5 and @xmath3 $ ] , led @xcite to conclude that `` the measured lithium abundance is not exactly the original abundance .",
    "it must have been reduced by a factor of at least 1.5 and more probably 2 , from the abundance with which the star formed . ''",
    "( p. 212 ) .",
    "on the other hand , one may argue that , with the measurements of wmap , the cosmic microwave background determines the baryon@xmath0to@xmath0photon@xmath0ratio , @xmath6 , @xcite so that big bang models predict the original li abundance @xcite .",
    "this predicted original li abundance is a factor of 2@xmath03 larger than the li abundance in stars of the plateau @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the wmap best fit , which includes the use of other data sets ( see sec . 3 of @xcite ) leads to @xmath7    in this paper we assume the cosmological li abundance to be given by equation ( [ eq : wmapli ] ) and determine the implications for stellar evolution models of pop ii stars . to this end",

    "the constancy of the abundance as a function of @xmath5 is then less surprising than originally thought .",
    "potential observational tests are also suggested .",
    "in the halo , @xcite have obtained very similar li abundances for nearly all low metallicity dwarf stars with @xmath9 . following those original observations , the existence of the li abundance plateau in pop ii halo stars has been repeatedly confirmed . in particular",

    "the @xmath10 value follows if one uses the lower @xmath5 scale preferred for instance by @xcite whereas the @xmath11 value follows if one uses the high @xmath5 scale for dwarf stars @xcite . partly because of the discussion in sec . 3 of @xcite and the better agreement with low metallicity cluster isochrones shown in that paper",
    "if the high @xmath5 scale is used , we tend to prefer that scale .",

    "they play a major role in the particle transport equations .",
    "the formalism of @xcite is used to calculate the transport velocities leading to 56 ( 28 chemical species and 2 equations per species ) non - linear coupled differential equations . in this series",
    ", evolutionary models have been calculated for pop ii stars of 0.5 to 1.2 @xmath32 with [ fe / h]@xmath33 from @xmath34 to @xmath35 @xcite and for solar metallicity clusters by @xcite .",
    "these models are called the _ models with atomic diffusion _ in what follows . in this paper",

    "models for this series are described in @xcite but additional models were calculated for this paper .",
    "our aim in calculating models with turbulence is to determine the level of turbulence that the @xmath8 and @xmath2 observations require .",
    "this may later be used to determine the physical mechanism causing this turbulence .",
    "these models are called the _ models with turbulence _ in what follows ; in addition to turbulent diffusion _ they also include all effects of atomic diffusion_.      for surface li abundance variations , perhaps the most important property of evolutionary models is how temperature ( see figure [ fig : dtbcz ] ) and mass ( see figure  1 , 2 and 12 of @xcite ) vary at the base of the surface convection zone . the temperature , @xmath37 , is directly related to li burning while the mass , @xmath38 , is directly related to the time scale of gravitational settling ( see @xcite ) .",
    "even in one single model , say the 0.77 @xmath32 one , the @xmath38 decreases by a factor of 30 during main  sequence evolution while @xmath37 decreases by a factor of 3 .",
    "most of the gravitational settling should occur around turnoff when @xmath38 is smallest . because of the high sensitivity of li burning to @xmath18 , any burning of surface li should occur early in the star s evolution when @xmath37 is largest . as will be shown in ",
    "[ sec : diffusion ] the reduction of surface li does not necessarily occur through burning however .",
    "on the lower part of figure [ fig : dtbcz ] , main  sequence stars are on the lower branch and stars past turnoff are on the upper branch of each curve .",
    "an important characteristic is the independence of the @xmath37 on metallicity during main  sequence evolution .",
    "it depends only on @xmath5 .",
    "this makes it possible for processes that reduce the li abundance to be independent of [ fe / h ] .",
    "results will be shown for two different parametrizations of turbulent diffusion coefficients .",
    "one parametrization allows to determine the turbulence which minimizes the reduction of surface @xmath8 abundance throughout the evolution of stars of different masses .",
    "the turbulent diffusion coefficient is defined as a function of @xmath18 in order to allow adjusting it to limit gravitational settling of @xmath8 while not burning @xmath8 .",
    "it is then essential to link turbulence to @xmath18 since the rate of the nuclear reaction @xmath39 is highly @xmath18 sensitive ; the li burning occurs at @xmath40 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . to minimize li abundance reduction",
    "one then tries to adjust the turbulent diffusion coefficient to be smaller than atomic diffusion slightly below that @xmath18 so that turbulence reduces settling as much as is possible in surface layers without forcing @xmath8 to diffuse by turbulence to @xmath40 .",
    "the parameters specifying turbulent transport coefficients are indicated in the name assigned to the model .",
    "for instance , in the t6.0d400 - 3 model , the turbulent diffusion coefficient , @xmath41 , is 400 times larger than the he atomic diffusion coefficient at @xmath42 and varying as @xmath43 or : @xmath44^{-3}.\\ ] ] to simplify writing , t6.0 will also be used instead of t6.0d400 - 3 since all models discussed in this paper have the d400 - 3 parametrization . the @xmath43 dependence is suggested ( see @xcite ) by observations of the be solar abundance today showing it is hardly smaller than the original be abundance ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this imposes a rapid decrease of the turbulent transport coefficient as @xmath45 or @xmath18 increases .",
    "examples of those turbulent diffusion coefficients and how they compare to atomic diffusion coefficients are shown in figure6 of @xcite .",
    "series of evolutionary models were calculated with t6.0 , t6.09 , t6.25 and t6.28 in order to investigate the effect of various levels of turbulence and determine the parameters that lead to the observed level of surface li abundance reduction .",
    "the second parametrization of turbulent diffusion coefficients that is used here was introduced into their solar model by @xcite . in this parametrization",
    "@xmath36 has always the same value immediately below the convection zone .",
    "it is , in this model , implicitly assumed that turbulence is generated from motions in the convection zone .",
    "@xcite determined as a maximum level of turbulent transport allowed by the observed solar li abundance : @xmath46^{-3}.\\ ] ] this model will be labeled pm7500 .",
    "when used in the solar model that serves as bench mark for calculations of this paper , it reduces @xmath8 at the solar age by a factor @xmath47 , whereas replacing 7500 by 4000 ( not shown ) and 2000 ( labeled pm2000 ) in equation  ( [ eq : dts ] ) leads respectively to reduction factors of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this was verified by detailed stellar evolution calculations .",
    "the observed solar photospheric abundance is approximately @xmath50 what is thought to be the original abundance but a pre ",
    "main  sequence reduction by a factor of 3 to 15 is expected ( see table 1 of @xcite ) leaving a reduction of li during the main  sequence by a factor of 15 to 70 .",
    "solar models were calculated for this paper both with the pmx and tx parametrizations . in the case of the sun , one",
    "can obtain the desired li value at the age of the sun with either parametrization .",
    "the time evolution of the turbulent diffusion coefficients at @xmath51 are compared in figure [ fig : dt ] .",
    "the density @xmath51 was chosen for the comparison because it is , during most of the evolution , between the convection zone and the region where li burns both in the solar and in the 0.77 @xmath32 models .",
    "since for all calculations described in this paper @xmath36 varies as @xmath52 , the comparison at one density is valid for all densities .",
    "one notes from figure [ fig : dt ] that , at a given @xmath45 , the @xmath36 of the 0.77@xmath53 t6.25 model is nearly equal that of the t6.4 solar model and of pm2000 throughout the evolution . in the 0.70@xmath54 t6.25 model",
    "it is a factor of 2.5 larger .",
    "the 0.77@xmath54 t6.09 model has a factor of 10@xmath030 smaller @xmath36 than the other model .",
    "using the pm2000 parametrization throughout the evolution of pop ii stars leads however to excessive li destruction in the lower mass objects .",
    "the extent to which this is true will become more evident by considering li isochrones in the next section .",
    "the range of @xmath36 values compatible with li surface abundance in both the sun and pop ii dwarfs is surprisingly small .",
    "lithium abundance isochrones for models with atomic diffusion and different series of models with turbulence are shown in figures [ fig : isoch7 ] and [ fig : isoch6 ] .",
    "main  sequence destruction is independent of the level of turbulence since during the pre ",
    "main  sequence the whole star is mixed by a convection zone . it is indicated separately in the upper part of the figures and is not included in the lower part .",
    "the reduction factor on the pre  main  sequence multiplies the reduction factor on the main  sequence .",
    "on the main  sequence , the @xmath8 abundance drops by at least @xmath55  dex in any star whatever the turbulence .",
    "the situation is a little complex at turnoff in that , while the @xmath8 abundance is smaller ( the reduction factor is larger ) in the model with atomic diffusion than in those with turbulence , at @xmath56k the @xmath8 abundance is smaller in most of the models with turbulence and decreases as turbulence is increased . at @xmath56",
    "k , the model with t6.0 turbulence has a very slightly larger @xmath8 abundance than the model with atomic diffusion .    also shown in figure [ fig : isoch7 ] is the isochrone calculated with turbulence linked to the position of the convection zone given by equation ( [ eq : dts ] ) , labeled pm7500 , and the pm2000 one .",
    "they both produce a large variation of li .",
    "this parametrization extends the mixed zone below the bottom of the convection zone by a fixed factor , large enough to minimize settling around 13.5 gyr for instance in the 0.77 @xmath32 star ( a factor of 100 or so is needed ) .",

    "main  sequence is relatively uncertain .",
    "@xcite concluded that pre ",
    "main  sequence li destruction was a sensitive function of a number of parameters such as metallicity and he content ( see also @xcite ) and details of the convection model @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtain a factor of 20 reduction of surface @xmath8 during the solar pre  main  sequence ( see their fig .",
    " main  sequence destruction of @xmath2 is large for @xmath60 k ( see fig . [",
    "fig : isoch6 ] ) .",
    "this limiting @xmath5 is uncertain but pre  main  sequence nuclear destruction appears unlikely to play a role at turnoff .    the original @xmath2 abundance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isoch6 ] ) is arbitrary and chosen to reproduce the observed values in the turnoff stars where it was observed .",
    "the @xmath61 ratio is reduced by a factor of about 4 on the pre ",
    "main  sequence at 6000 k and by very large factors at smaller @xmath5 so that one should expect to observe @xmath2 only above 6000 k. @xmath2 is less affected by atomic diffusion than @xmath8 so that _ the ratio @xmath61 is larger than initially at turnoff in stars where only atomic diffusion is important for both @xmath2 and @xmath8_. in both the t6.25 and t6.28 models @xmath2 is destroyed by large factors even in turnoff stars .",
    "one important characteristic of the isochrones is that , at a given @xmath5 before turnoff , the li abundance does not depend on metallicity .",
    "this is related to the property of @xmath38 , shown in figure 2 of @xcite , and of @xmath37 shown in figure [ fig : dtbcz ] above . throughout main  sequence evolution ,",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath37 depend only on @xmath5 independent of metallicity over the metallicity range of interest .",
    "consequently , for the small metallicities considered , settling depends only on @xmath5 and the distance between the @xmath38 and the temperature where li burns depends only on @xmath5 .",
    "this property may be seen , for the models with atomic diffusion , in figures 9 and 11 of @xcite . after turnoff variations are seen as a function of metallicity however . that the li abundance reduction at a given @xmath5 is independent of metallicity before turnoff is then easy to understand .",
    "what is more surprising is that there should be a relatively wide plateau as a function of @xmath5 .      at the same time as big bang models predict a abundance from wmap observations",
    ", they also predict an original mass fraction of @xmath62 which is slightly larger than @xmath63 used in all calculations presented in this paper except in this section .",
    "the original he abundance used for most calculations is the same as used in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this choice was made partly for consistency with previous calculations and partly because we had a large number of calculations available with that abundance .",
    "furthermore previous results have shown that such a small abundance change had little effect on the turnoff luminosity vs age relation ( see fig .",
    "4 of @xcite ) .",
    "one may however wonder if the quantities that depend most sensitively on the value of the @xmath38 , such as the surface isochrones may not be affected by such a change in initial abundance .",
    "we have calculated a series of models with diffusion with @xmath62 in order to determine the size of the effect .",
    "abundance isochrones calculated in both the diffusion models calculated with @xmath63 and those with @xmath62 are compared in figure [ fig : isochhe ] .",
    "the differences are very small and are mainly due to our use of straight line segments between calculated points . in stellar models of a given mass ,",
    "the differences are significant but at a given age and @xmath5 , the differences in surface abundance are negligible .",
    "the main change is in the mass of the model that is at a given evolutionary step . at 13.5 gyr",
    "the @xmath64 model with maximum @xmath5 has @xmath65 , whereas the model with @xmath66 with maximum @xmath5 has 0.77 @xmath53 .",
    "the models with the minimum values of have respectively masses of 0.76 and 0.78 @xmath54 .",
    "so at a given age , the isochrones are very nearly the same but for different mass models .    in figure",
    "[ fig : isochhe ] , we have continued the isochrones on the subgiant branch where the surface abundance is most sensitive to the @xmath38 .",
    "this was not done on figure [ fig : isoch7 ] in order to avoid confusion with other curves .",
    "we have also verified ( not shown ) that the ( @xmath5 , @xmath67 ) isochrones were not significantly modified , confirming the analysis of @xcite .",
    "to understand what the constancy of the li abundance as a function of @xmath5 implies , one needs to understand the transport mechanisms below surface convection zones .",
    "nuclear burning , atomic diffusion and turbulence are involved .      from an analysis of nuclear reaction rates and a comparison to detailed calculations ,",
    "@xcite obtained that ( see their eq.1 ) the relationship between the remaining fraction of the two li isotopes may be expressed by : @xmath68 the value of @xmath69 comes from the ratio of the nuclear reaction rates and varies from @xmath70 to 94 depending on the value of @xmath18 where most @xmath2 burns .",
    "@xcite obtained equation ( [ eq:6_7 ] ) in pre ",
    "main  sequence stars where there is nearly instantaneous mixing of the whole star by convection . during main  sequence evolution ,",
    "the situation is more complex .    by comparing the isochrones for @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isoch7 ] ) with those for the @xmath2 to @xmath8 ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isoch6 ] ) , it is clear that the abundance of @xmath2 varies much more slowly compared to that of @xmath8 than is given by equation ( [ eq:6_7 ] ) with @xmath70 .",
    "for instance at turnoff with t6.25 turbulence the @xmath2 to @xmath8 ratio is reduced by about 1.2 dex while @xmath8 is reduced by about 0.4 dex whereas equation ( [ eq:6_7 ] ) would have led to more than 30 dex reduction of @xmath2 for that reduction of @xmath8 .",
    "this leads us to investigate the various contributions to atomic and turbulent diffusion velocities immediately below surface convection zones .",
    "burning occurs a finite distance from the bottom of the surface convection zone and the surface li is destroyed only in so far as it is transported to the burning region by turbulence ( see @xcite for approximate evaluation formulas ) . the reduction rate of the surface @xmath2 and @xmath8 abundance depends on the transport efficiency from the bottom of the surface convection zone to the layer where @xmath2 and @xmath8 burn .",
    "it also depends on how much of the surface abundance reduction is due to atomic diffusion and how much to turbulent transport to the burning region .      while , in our evolutionary models , a complex set of 56 coupled differential equations is used , in order to interpret the results of the evolutionary models , it is convenient to use a diffusion equation developed for ternary mixtures by @xcite .",

    "the diffusive term is then reducing the effect of gravitational settling , just as it does reduce the effect of the advective term for other metals .",

    "atomic diffusion is still the dominant transport process for @xmath8 below the surface convection zone .",
    "we have also verified ( not shown ) that , in the absence of atomic diffusion , the surface @xmath93 abundance reduction is dominated by turbulent transport and the reduction factor does not approach the value of equation ( [ eq:6_7 ] ) with @xmath94 .",

    "have been observed , and may be explained by these results ( for instance the star represented by a magenta cross at @xmath96 k ) .",
    "however no general reduction of li abundance is observed above 6000 k. as in pop i stars , additional turbulence appears to be required _ at least in some stars _ @xcite .",
    "series of models with different assumptions about the strength of turbulence were then calculated .",
    "one series uses t6.25 turbulence and the result of a simulation for 50 stars is shown on the lower part of figure  [ fig : casino ] .",

    "figure  15 of that paper also shows that the high constancy of the li abundance observations above 5600 k can be reproduced and even exceeded in a self consistent model with turbulence .",

    "all tx models lead to fairly horizontal isochrones but with progressively larger li abundance reduction as x increases .",

    "the reason for the li plateau in a given tx model is relatively easy to understand . in a given tx model",

    "since the mass above a given @xmath18 does not vary rapidly as a function of @xmath102 , the li reservoir to be burned is always about the same for all @xmath102 . at a given age ,",

    "it is not possible to extend convection zones by approximately a fixed level of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the value given by equation ( [ eq : dts ] ) had been found by @xcite to slightly overdestroy li in their solar model .",
    "it is an upper limit because part of the li destruction is believed to have been caused by pre ",
    "main  sequence burning . in the solar models of this paper , it however overdestroys li by at least a factor of 10 , probably because of a deeper surface convection zone as compared to the model of @xcite .",
    "one has to reduce the turbulence given by equation ( [ eq : dts ] ) by a factor of 3 to 4 .",
    "the model compatible with surface solar li abundance is that labeled pm2000 in figure [ fig : isoch7 ] .",
    "\\6 ) it is of course possible to determine a value of x such that tx models have the observed li destruction in the sun since one has one observation and one adjustable parameter . the level of turbulent transport required to explain the solar value is around t6.40 or about 0.2@xmath00.3 dex deeper in @xmath18 than required to reproduce the li abundance of the pop ii li plateau .",
    "it is however surprising that the tx required for the sun should be so close to the tx model that best reproduces li in popii stars .",
    "as may be seen in figure [ fig : dt ] , the turbulent diffusion coefficient below convection zones in a 0.77 @xmath32 t6.25 pop ii star is very nearly the same as in the t6.40 sun throughout evolution .",
    "\\7 ) clearly there remains considerable uncertainty in the value of the turbulent diffusion coefficients .",
    "there are many potential sources of such turbulence since , for instance , convective motions inside convection zones must lead to some turbulent motions beyond the frontier .",

    "\\8 ) surface @xmath2 is not destroyed by nuclear reactions on the main  sequence in models with atomic diffusion for @xmath103 k. in models with t6.09 turbulence , destruction of surface @xmath2 occurs only in stars with @xmath104 k. however , in models with t6.25 and t6.28 turbulence , surface @xmath2 is destroyed by more than a factor of 30 even in turnoff star . _",
    "the presence of @xmath2 in some turnoff stars appears to rule out t6.25 and t6.28 turbulence . _",
    "\\9 ) in all stars appearing in figure [ fig : isoch6 ] , the ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath8 destruction is much smaller than @xmath105 . a large fraction of the li transport has been caused by atomic diffusion in all turbulence models considered ( see  [ sec : settling ] ) .",
    "we have also verified that even if one neglects atomic diffusion , one still does not get the very large ratio given by equation ( [ eq:6_7 ] ) .",
    "such a ratio applies only if @xmath2 destruction occurs _ in _ the convection zone .",
    "as soon as a transport process is involved , the depletion factor depends more on the properties of the transport process than on ratios of nuclear reaction rates . in most stars ,",
    "li destruction occurs in the convection zone only while it is on the pre  main  sequence .      the li abundance in pop ii stars has generated a large number of papers and we do not intend to review all of them .",
    "it is however appropriate to analyze briefly the link to other points of view .",
    "@xcite argued that the current spite plateau observations were consistent with evolutionary models including only atomic diffusion if all plateau stars were 13.5 to 14 gyr old and they also argued that this implied a reduction from the original abundance by a factor of about two , consistent with analyses of the cosmic microwave background . to be consistent with observations as presented in figure [ fig : casino ] , this requires , as discussed by those authors , uncertainties in the @xmath5 scale conspiring to minimize the @xmath5 dependence of the li abundance on halo stars .",
    "the small sampling scale may also play a role and they argue that more observations are needed to exclude , at an acceptable certainty level , that surface abundances are determined by stellar evolution models with atomic diffusion without significant contribution from macroscopic mixing processes .",
    "we agree that more observations of li in halo stars are needed to firmly establish the origin of the li abundance reduction and also that the @xmath5 scale may well be off by some 100 or , perhaps , 200 k. this may reduce the difference between the wmap value and the spite plateau to a factor of @xmath106 2 .",
    "it seems more difficult to explain the continuity of the spite plateau to the highest observed @xmath5 without the presence of some weak turbulence in those stars .",
    "the more frequently discussed point of view has followed @xcite analysis of the possible role of turbulent transport in causing li destruction and/or reducing li settling .",
    "prescriptions for the initial angular momentum distribution , angular momentum loss , turbulent transport of angular momentum and of li are required .",
    "given the current level of understanding of turbulent transport processes , different arbitrary parameters are used for angular momentum and particle transport even though efforts are made to link the two .",
    "various prescriptions were studied but , given input uncertainties , obtaining credible models is a formidable task . @xcite and @xcite obtained destruction factors of up to 10 and linked their assumptions of the effect of internal differential rotation to observations of rotation on the horizontal branch .",
    "one has to assume an initial distribution of angular momentum and one then tends to obtain excessive li abundance dispersion @xcite . @xcite",
    "strove to satisfy the small dispersion observed on the spite plateau by varying input parameters and turbulent transport coefficients for pop i and ii stars .",
    "they were able to define a set of original angular momentum distribution and transport coefficients calibrations consistent with observed li dispersion .",
    "while they do not explicitly say so , they appear to have neglected atomic diffusion in their calculations .",
    "@xcite concluded that the li abundance depletion had to be between 0.2 and 0.4 dex .",
    "since little is known about either initial angular momentum , turbulent transport of angular momentum or turbulent transport of li , one should perhaps not be too surprised that these studies have not been very conclusive .",
    "one difficulty with these models is that they neglect any potential role of internal magnetic fields in transporting angular momentum . in particular models based on diffusive transport of angular momentum",
    "never reproduced the near solid body rotation of the sun revealed by heliosismology @xcite .",
    "the flat rotation profile of the sun is much more easily reproduced once magnetic fields are introduced @xcite . as an alternative ,",
    "@xcite have suggested that the solar interior could be slowed down by internal gravity waves that might lead also to a li spite plateau @xcite .",
    "both the magnetic and gravity wave models have the advantage of being compatible with solar be abundance observations while models which strive to explain momentum transport by turbulent diffusion are not @xcite .",
    "the difficulties with reproducing in detail the observations once transport processes are taken into account led some to consider _ standard _ stellar evolution where it is _ arbitrarily assumed _ that there is no transport process outside of convection zones so that no depletion from the original li occurs on the spite plateau @xcite .",
    "there is no physical justification to assume that physical processes described from first principles do not apply to the spite plateau stars .",
    "we have confirmed , using the latest evolutionary model calculations , the result of @xcite that atomic diffusion imposes a reduction by a factor of at least 1.6 , and more probably 2.0 , of the li abundance observed in the oldest stars as compared to that produced in the big bang . as briefly described in  [ sec : other ] , this result is consistent with most other calculations done since , except _ when atomic diffusion is arbitrarily neglected _ in the calculations .",
    "this result is also confirmed observationally by the li abundance of the spite plateau being a factor of 2 to 3 smaller than the primordial value inferred from wmap as described in  [ sec : context ] and  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "independent of the degree of turbulence in the outer regions , @xcite ( p. 496 ) have obtained for m92 an age of 13.5 gyr which is consistent with the wmap determination of the age of the universe and which is 2 gyr smaller than the age determined by @xcite who used models in which atomic diffusion was neglected .",
    "the limitation of the approach comes from the constancy of the li abundance in low metallicity pop ii stars above @xmath107 k. when special care is taken to reduce as much as possible the observational errors , as done for instance by @xcite , one obtains a smaller dispersion for most stars with @xmath108k .",
    "this is the reason for part of the difference between the observations on the upper and lower parts of figure  [ fig : casino ] .",
    "part of the scattering of the observations of @xcite appears to be observational .",
    "it appears that the star to star variation of the li abundance is at most 0.1 dex at a given @xmath5 except for a number of stars that are a factor of 2 or more below the plateau .",
    "this excludes any process that would lead to large abundance variations and would depend on a property varying from star to star such as original stellar angular momentum , for instance .",
    "it is however consistent with atomic diffusion being the main li transport process from the convection zone , as found in ",
    "[ sec : diffusion ] to be the case even in presence of turbulent transport .",
    "turbulent transport is then a perturbation to the main transport process from the convection zone which is gravitational settling .",
    "we have learned a number of properties of the evolutionary models of pop ii stars that make this constancy less surprising than it appeared when first noticed . what is needed to reproduce the spite plateau",
    "may be inferred from figure [ fig : prof_li ] .",
    "a small amount of turbulence below the surface convection zone ( the t6.0 or perhaps the t6.09 model ) is all that is required to produce a sufficiently flat li abundance plateau .",
    "whether turbulent transport needs to extend deeper in , to the li burning region , is currently uncertain .",
    "this extension would cause the destruction of the li peak seen at @xmath109 in figure [ fig : prof_li ] .",
    "that turbulence does not directly modify gravitational settling from the convection zone . in the absence of turbulence ,",
    "the value of the li concentration in that peak is determined by atomic diffusion but is drastically reduced by any turbulence between @xmath109 and 6.40 .",
    "a reduction of this peak is needed if the spite plateau is more than a factor of 1.6 to 2 below the cosmological li abundance given by equation ( [ eq : wmapli ] ) so that gravitational settling from the convection zone may proceed without being excessively reduced by a backward turbulent diffusion transport ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vdif ] ) . if the high @xmath5 scale is the right one , the li reduction factor from the wmap value can probably be explained without a reduction of this peak .    if , on the other hand , the low @xmath5 scale is the right one , turbulent transport must approach the t6.25 model .",
    "it then plays a role in destroying the li peak mentioned above .",
    "the t6.25 turbulent transport model is surprisingly similar to the turbulent transport which is needed to reproduce the li abundance reduction in the sun ( see  [ sec : zc ] ) .",
    "the low temperature scale however leads to some difficulties with cluster isochrones @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that the pop ii stars with a li abundance a factor of 2 or more below the spite plateau and a @xmath110 k ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) are caused by a different process and should not be included in the search for an explanation of this plateau .",
    "if one looks at the upper part of figure  [ fig : casino ] one notes that , in the absence of turbulence , post turnoff stars could have a factor of 2 to 3 lower surface abundance than pre turnoff stars .",
    "such objects appear much less numerous than the number of post turnoff stars expected in this simulation where all stars are assumed to have no turbulence below the convection zone .",
    "it is however tempting to make the same suggestion as we made ( see  5 of @xcite ) to explain the @xcite observations of fe abundance variations in some m92 turnoff stars .",
    "just as in pop i , some 20  % of a stars have lower turbulence than most and develop abundance anomalies by atomic diffusion processes @xcite , similarly a fraction ( say 20  % ) of pop ii turnoff stars could have lower turbulence and have anomalously small li .",
    "this may be tested by a confirmation of the abundance variations in post turnoff stars of m92 . while @xcite suggest the presence of such anomalies , higher signal to noise observations appear needed to confirm this result especially since such anomalies are not seen in higher metallicity clusters , where however they would not be expected to form by atomic diffusion according to figure 10 of @xcite .",
    "the surface abundance of @xmath2 in the hotter stars of the plateau offers another test of the role of transport processes . while consistent with the transport being due to atomic diffusion , as described in ",
    "[ sec : settling ] , the presence of @xmath2 appears to rule out the t6.25 model , that is the most turbulent transport model consistent with wmap and the spite plateau ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "it is then a very important additional constraint on turbulent transport and it would be important to confirm and or extend the few positive @xmath2 detections mentioned in  [ sec : observations ] .    given that the wmap implications for li cosmological abundance and the li spite plateau can be naturally explained by gravitational settling in presence of weak turbulence , there appears little need for exotic physics as suggested by @xcite and @xcite for instance .",
    "instead , there is a need for a better understanding of turbulent transport in the radiative zones of stars .",
