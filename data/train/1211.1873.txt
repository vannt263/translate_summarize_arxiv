    "we consider here an ensemble of @xmath11  independent copies of the real system . in each copy , a different set of bonds forms between the linkers ( see figure  [ fig : system ] ) .",
    "let @xmath12 be the number of copies where linker  @xmath0 is unbound , and let @xmath13 be the number of copies where @xmath0  and  @xmath1 are bound to each other .",
    "conversely , let @xmath14 be the number of copies where both @xmath0  and  @xmath1 are unbound .",
    "these quantities are not independent : each linker @xmath0 is either unbound or unbound , so @xmath15 the fraction of copies where @xmath0 is unbound ( @xmath16 ) , where @xmath0  and  @xmath1 are bound to each other ( @xmath17 ) , or where they are both unbound ( @xmath18 ) follow immediately : @xmath19 let @xmath20 be the partition function of an ensemble under the constraint that each pair of linkers @xmath0  and  @xmath1 is bound to each other in exactly @xmath13 copies . a closed - form expression for @xmath20 can be constructed recursively , by adding each bond one by one . for a given set of @xmath7 , we need to work out how @xmath20 changes upon adding one more @xmath0-@xmath1 bond , which we do as follows .",
    "we call the set of realisations of the ensemble with @xmath7 bonds the _ old _ ensemble , and that of realisations with one more @xmath0-@xmath1 bond , the _ new _ ensemble . in the old ensemble , there are @xmath14 copies where an @xmath0-@xmath1 bond can be added . in doing this",
    ", all the realisations of the new ensemble are generated , but not uniquely . for example , given two realisations , one with an @xmath21 bond in copy x but not in y or z , and one with an @xmath21 bond in y but not in x or z , the same final realisation can be obtained by adding an @xmath21 bond to y in the former and x in the latter .",
    "conversely , in the new ensemble , we can generate a realisation of the old ensemble in @xmath22 ways by removing one of the @xmath0-@xmath1 bonds .",
    "for example , the old realisation with an i - j bond in copy x but not y or z can be obtained by deleting the @xmath21 bond from a new realisation with an @xmath21 bond in x and y but not z , or from one with an @xmath21 bond in x and z but not y. since the number of ways of going from the old to the new ensemble is equal to the number of ways of going from the new to the old ensemble , it follows that    @xmath23    the value of @xmath14 depends not just on the values of @xmath7 but on the details of how those bonds are distributed between copies ( see figure  [ fig : system ] ) . to remove this complication , we approximate the probability of @xmath1 being unbound as independent of whether or not @xmath0 is also bound . hence , @xmath24 neatly , this approximation allows us to treat @xmath14 as a function of only @xmath7 . from the discussion above",
    ", we obtain an expression for the increase in @xmath20 upon adding one @xmath0-@xmath1 bond to the system : @xmath25 this recursion relation , and the fact that @xmath26 when no bonds form , allows us to write an approximate closed - form expression for @xmath20 , namely @xmath27 using stirling s approximation and eq .  , the free energy per copy @xmath28 is then given by    @xmath29    treating @xmath30 as continuous in the range @xmath31 $ ] , the overall free energy per copy of the ensemble , @xmath32 , follows from a saddle - point approximation : @xmath33\\\\   = \\beta{f_{\\text{att}}}^*(\\{\\overline{f_{ij}}\\ } ) + \\mathcal{o}(\\ln n / n ) \\approx \\beta{f_{\\text{att}}}^*(\\{\\overline{f_{ij}}\\ } ) , \\label{eqn : saddle}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the integration is over all positive values of @xmath30 satisfying @xmath34 for all  @xmath0 and the values @xmath35 are obtained by minimising the free energy per copy , @xmath36 when @xmath37 , the values @xmath35 are precisely the average values of @xmath30 .",
    ".   implies that @xmath35  and  @xmath10 obey identical equations ( eq .  ) , and so are equal : @xmath38      the free energy @xmath32 , defined in eq .  , is equal to the free energy of the real system to the extent that the approximation in eq .",
    "since this is the same approximation that we used previously@xcite to calculate the free energy in terms of a thermodynamic integral , @xmath39 , it is reasonable to suppose that @xmath32  and  @xmath39 are equal .",
    "we now show this explicitly .    in our original paper , we calculated the exact attractive free energy for the real system of linkers using thermodynamic integration .",
    "specifically , we replaced @xmath40 by @xmath41 , whereupon the probabilities @xmath9  and  @xmath10 become functions of  @xmath42 .",
    "we then integrated the appropriate free energy derivative over the range @xmath43 , and obtained @xmath44 the same replacement of @xmath40 with @xmath41 can be made in the ensemble of @xmath11  copies . in that case , using eqs .  and",
    ", we find that @xmath45 the first term vanishes owing to eqs .  and  , and the second term follows immediately from eq .  .",
    "we then have @xmath46 moreover , both @xmath32  and  @xmath39 are zero when @xmath42 is infinite , so the two quantities are equal for all  @xmath42 .    the previous result , together with eqs .",
    " , yields the following closed - form expression for @xmath39 :    @xmath47    this expression is , in fact , equivalent to the much more compact eq .  . concretely ,    @xmath48",
    "figure  [ fig : speedup ] reports the typical computational speedups obtained by using eq .   versus our original thermodynamic integral , eq .  ,",
    "for systems of @xmath49  linkers . the speedup is higher for larger  @xmath49 and for stronger bonds because each evaluation of the thermodynamic integrand involves solving a system of @xmath49  equations , and the size of the integration domain scales linearly with the bond strength",

    "computational speedups obtained by using eq .   vs. eq .  , for a system of parallel plates coated with complementary linkers .",
    "]    in the limit of weak - bonds , where @xmath5 is close to 0 , we find that @xmath50 this approximate result has been widely used by previous authors@xcite under the name of the `` poisson approximation '' or the `` weak binding regime '' .",
    "however , in experiments with micron - sized dna - coated colloids , this approximation can be significantly inaccurate@xcite . at the nanoscale , where high bond strengths are commonly used ,",
    "the poisson approximation is expected to break down ( see fig .",

    "for example , dreyfus et al.@xcite model the attraction between two dna - coated spheres by first estimating the maximum number  @xmath51 of linkers on each sphere that could form a bond with a linker on the second sphere , and then assuming that each such linker can independently bind any of @xmath52 linkers with an average free energy @xmath53 . for later convenience",

    "our definition of @xmath39 is the free energy of the system of linkers , and includes the configuration where no bonds are formed ] @xmath60 = -n_p\\ln(1+x)\\\\ & \\approx -n_p ( x - x^2/2 + \\cdots ) .",

    "however , there is significant disagreement already at second order in  @xmath54 , where linkers begin to compete for binding partners .",
    "free energy per linker in the `` poisson approximation '' and the present model .",
    "higher values of @xmath64 lead to higher bonding probabilities , either because bonds are stronger or because linkers have more binding partners .",
    "the two models agree in the `` weak binding regime '' ( @xmath65 ) , but disagree when correlations between neighbouring strands become significant . ]    finally , using the same procedure as in our original paper , we can directly write an attractive free energy density for a pair of plates , treated at a more approximate , _ spatial _ mean - field level . in the notation of ref .  ,",
    "@xmath66 this result also follows from a large - area limit of eq .   with random grafting points  @xcite .",
