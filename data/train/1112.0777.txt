    "luminous ( @xmath0 ) and ultraluminous ( @xmath1 ) infrared ( ir ) galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs , respectively ) , have high star formation ( sf ) rates .",
    "the fraction of sf in u / lirgs in the local universe is small compared to that in normal spiral galaxies ; however , at high redshift they become the dominant sources of sf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "stars more massive than @xmath2 explode as core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , and due to their short life cycles they are a very useful tool for tracing ongoing sf rates , independent of the conventional way of using the galaxy ir luminosity .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented evidence that the sn population in the interacting lirg system differs from those observed in normal spiral galaxies with the ib and iib sne being more numerous and centrally concentrated than more common type ii sne . until now",
    ", this kind of study has been impossible due to insufficient numbers of sne discovered in u / lirgs , providing a strong motivation for sn searches in galaxies with high sf rates .",
    "the extinction - free searches at radio wavelengths using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) have been successful in discovering sne and sn remnants in u / lirgs , e.g. , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reason for the low optical discovery rate of ccsne in u / lirgs is the high dust extinction combined with spatial concentration of sf in the crowded nuclear regions within the central few hundreds of parsecs ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore imaging in the near - ir where the extinction is strongly reduced , and high spatial resolution is achievable with ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) or space - based imaging is required .",
    "recently such methods have been shown to be very efficient with the discovery of several sne in the lirg nuclear / circumnuclear regions . was discovered with the very large telescope using the natural guide star naco ao system @xcite . and reported in @xcite were discovered using the gemini - north telescope with the laser guide star ( lgs ) assisted altair ao system and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) nicmos archive data , respectively .    in this letter , we report the consecutive discovery of two sne in the same host galaxy with the gemini - north telescope , and . @xcite report the host lirg ( also known as e.g. , , , and ) to have an ir luminosity of @xmath3 = 4.7 \\times 10^{11 } l_{\\odot}$ ] and a distance of 100 mpc ( h@xmath4 = 75 km  s@xmath5mpc@xmath5 ) giving a projected linear distance scale @xmath6  pc .",

    "and were discovered as a result of our _ k_-band search for highly - obscured ccsne in a sample of eight nearby lirgs using the gemini - north telescope with the near - infrared imager ( niri ) with altair lgs ao system ( 0.022pixel@xmath5 , fwhm @xmath8 0.1 ) .",

    "the images were divided into multiple contour regions based on the surface brightness , a reference frame was subtracted from the images using isis 2.2 and the subtracted frames were run through sextractor @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry of the detected objects was compared with the standard deviation calculated for a random grid of aperture sums within each contour region .",

    "these initial results indicate that our search was sensitive enough to discover sne @xmath34  mag fainter than and in the central regions of ( and lirgs with similar properties ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath35  mag higher extinctions in @xmath28 . however , our sn detection sensitivity drops significantly in the nuclear @xmath36100  pc regions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with only very high resolution vlbi observations being able to detect highly obscured sne therein ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for we obtained satisfactory fits with both the slowly declining and type iip templates whereas the light curves and colours of the ordinary template fit are not consistent with the sn , when the _",
    "j_-band upper limit is taken into account .",
    "the absolute brightness and the discovery epoch of the sn at day 62 given by the type iip fit is also very reasonable given the fact that the galaxy was observed for the first time in over 8 months .",
    "in contrast in the slowly declining template fit the sn would have to be underluminous by more than 2  mag compared to the template and discovered close to the maximum .",
    "however , based on only three epochs of photometry we can not definitively determine the type of between slowly declining and type iip .",
    "regardless of the template used they both yield very low host galaxy extinction estimates @xmath37  mag .",
    "for we do not find the ordinary template fit very likely , even though it gives the best reduced @xmath24 value , as it would require the sn to be discovered on day -38 , thus having an unrealistically long rise time for an ordinary ccsn .",
    "we note that in @xcite we found a @xmath38-band rise time of @xmath39  days for with the slowly declining template providing the best fit to the data .",
    "however , ccsne interacting with their csm have shown delayed rise to their near - ir peak compared to their optical discovery , e.g. , sn 2006jc @xcite .",
    "the slowly declining and the type iip templates both give reasonable fits and extinction estimates @xmath40  mag . in the type iip comparison",
    "the sn is expected to be 1.65  mag brighter than the canonical , however , type iip sne are known to show intrinsic variations of several magnitudes in their maximum brightness . for example",
    "@xcite was roughly 2  mag brighter than a prototypical type iip . adopting the slowly declining template",
    "would have been caught in the beginning of the near - ir excess phase , being intrinsically slightly brighter than the template . as only two epochs of photometry are available both template fits seem reasonable .",
    "radio observations of and with the electronic european vlbi network ( e - evn ) at 5  ghz on 2011 march 23.1 ut and the electronic multi - element remotely linked interferometer network ( e - merlin ) at 6.9  ghz resulted in upper limits for the radio emission from both sne ( see * ? ? ?",

    "was also derived based on the ir spectral energy distribution predicting a ccsn rate of 1.1  yr@xmath5 , consistent with the discovery of two sne within two years .    as shown earlier",
    ", the @xmath30 colour map extinction of @xmath42  mag for the line - of - sight through the whole galaxy is more of a lower limit for the total line - of - sight extinction .",
    "this gives freedom for any template fitted extinction estimate to be possible .",
    "however , the template fits for give extinctions well below this limit . for only the slowly",
    "declining template fit with negligible host galaxy extinction is found to be consistent with an estimated maximum line - of - sight extinction of @xmath43  mag from the extinction map .",
    "however , higher localized extinction values , beyond the resolution of the extinction map , could be possible .",
    "the adaptive optics assisted discovery of two consecutive sne located at @xmath44  pc from the lirg nucleus demonstrates the importance of high spatial resolution in searches for ccsne in highly crowded starburst regions in lirgs .",
    "we note that of the five sne discovered using high resolution near - ir observations in our sample of lirgs ( see sect .  1 ) , four are within 1  kpc from the host nucleus .",
    "based on the near - ir light curve fitting to templates we find to be consistent with either a type iip or a near - ir bright type iin / l sn with a host galaxy extinction of @xmath45  mag .",
    "taking into account also the extinction map is found to be most consistent with a type iin / l sn during the near - ir excess phase with host galaxy extinction of @xmath46  mag .",
    "a type ib / c classification was found unlikely for both the sne .",
    "future near - ir and radio follow - up observations of will be able to better constrain the nature and line - of - sight extinction of this potentially very interesting event    the surprisingly low derived line - of - sight extinctions appear to be in conflict with the expectation of the occurrence of highly obscured ccsne in the nuclear region of lirgs .",

    "based on this it seems more likely that and are located in the outer parts of the lirg system which we see projected close to the lirg nucleus .",
    "additionally the majority of lirgs at the high ir luminosity end are complex interacting systems and their dust extinction distributions can be very complex compared to normal spiral galaxies with symmetric exponential disks , see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . despite the low extinctions such sne occurring close to the lirg nuclei",
