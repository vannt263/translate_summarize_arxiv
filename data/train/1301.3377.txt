    "plasma heating and acceleration are hot topics in the fields of nuclear fusion , plasma physics and astrophysics for a long time .",
    "a great number of heating mechanisms and theories have been proposed . in a collisionless space plasma environment ,",
    "wave - particle interactions play significant roles of plasma heating and acceleration@xcite .",
    "even when collisions are included , plasmas can still be heated by the interplay between waves and particles to a certain degree@xcite . among a suite of electromagnetic waves , alfvn waves",
    "are generally thought to be the major contributor to the ion heating and acceleration since they exist pervasively in the solar wind and interplanetary space@xcite .",
    "in thermodynamic sense , heating of ions by electromagnetic waves will lead to the dissipation of wave fields , thereby being an irreversible process .",
    "several recent studies however show that ions can be heated by turbulent alfvn waves in low - beta plasmas even when no dissipation of wave fields occurrswangprl , wuprl , wangpop , yoonpop , wupop1,bwangpop , sapl , yn ; a process that is called `` _ _ pseudoheating _ _ '' or nonresonant wave - particle interaction .",
    "various methods have been used to validate this heating mechanism such as the test - particle approach with analytic solutions@xcite , and quasi - linear theories@xcite .",
    "in fact , the name pseudoheating  may not be the best term to describe this `` heating '' process due to the kinetic effects of wave spectrawuprl , yoonpop .",
    "however , we still use this appellation for consistency in this paper .",
    "the pseudoheating is caused by the wave forces ( or their spectra ) that result in a deformation of the distribution function with respect to its initial maxwellian shape .",
    "the mean - square velocity fluctuation due to the wave activity leads to an effective broadening of the distribution function similar to real heating and thus could mimic the genuine heating process@xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that the heating shown by ref.@xcite contains both pseudoheating and genuine heating , which indicates that even in the particles mean - velocity frame , the random kinetic energy of particles still increases via wave - particle interactions .",
    "the real heating ( or the irreversible dissipation of the wave fields ) is caused by the _",
    "initial _ pitch - angle scattering of newly created ions@xcite , indicating that there exists the dissipation of wave fields .",
    "in contrast , the first adiabatic invariant ( magnetic moment @xmath2 ) remains constant during the pseudoheating and thus it is an reversible process .",
    "the real heating in refs.@xcite is caused by the violation of the first adiabatic invariant due to the abrupt spatial change of the magnetic field .",
    "it is noteworthy that there is a factor of two difference between the temperature expressions in ref.@xcite and ref.wuprl , resulting from the fact that quasilinear theory can not solve the problem of the wave damping appropriately .",
    "in addition , wang _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out that pitch - angle scattering plays a key role in the pseudoheating processwangpop .    in this paper , the heating process we focus on",
    "is restricted to the pseudoheating and thus the real heating is excluded .",
    "we demonstrate that the low - frequency alfvn wave propagating along the background magnetic field @xmath3 can _ _ heat__ions .",
    "the pseudoheating can be explained either by @xmath0 drift ( in the electric field of the alfvn wave and the ambient magnetic field @xmath4 ) proposed in this paper or the pitch - angle scattering previously investigated@xcite . our analytic results , as will be shown below ,",
    "are identical as those derived from quasilinear theory@xcite . as shown in previous work@xcite : @xmath5where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the wave magnetic field energy density and proton number density , respectively .",

    "here @xmath14 represents the `` _ _ apparent temperature _ _ '' that should be distinguished from the temperature associated with a real heating process@xcite .",
    "the structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows : we derive and discuss the analytic results of pseudoheating based on @xmath15 drift in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "test particle simulation results are presented and discussed based on the comparison of a monochromatic alfvn wave and a wave spectrum .",
    "we also briefly discuss the recent observations of large amplitude magnetic perturbations associated with alfvn waves and their correlation to the pseudoheating . in the last section ,",
    "conclusions are summarized .",
    "without loss of generality , left - hand circular polarized alfvn waves are considered in this paper .",
    "the wave magnetic field vector can thus be expressed as @xmath16from the faraday s law and the dispersion relation ( ampre s law ) @xmath17 , the electric field vector can be written as @xmath18where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are unit directional vectors , @xmath22 denotes the wave phase , @xmath23 is the random phase for mode @xmath24 and @xmath25 represents the alfvn speed . according to the linear approximation",
    ", we use eq.([efv ] ) and the first order term of the generalized ohmic law @xmath26 to derive the @xmath0 drift velocity , @xmath27 , that can be expressed as follows : @xmath28 the derivation above is consistent with the traditional procedure to derive the classical alfvn wave solution@xcite in the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) system .",
    "it indicates that the randomized proton motion is actually parasitic to wave fields due to the fact that the drift velocity @xmath27 is expected to disappear if the waves subside .",
    "given the assumption that the characteristic spatial scale of the system is much larger than typical alfvn wavelength@xcite , the energy density associated with the wave magnetic field can be written as : @xmath29 where the bracket @xmath30  denotes an average over all particles .",
    "given the large characteristic spatial scale of the system , @xmath31 , as described above , the following approximation is valid : @xmath32 the temperature expression shown below is the same as eq.([t_ps ] ) , @xmath33 the results shown in eqs.([wb])&([temp ] ) are consistent with the mhd theory due to the fact that the energy density associated with the alfvn wave magnetic field , @xmath34 , equals to the ion ( fluid ) kinetic energy density , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the perturbed ion ( fluid ) velocity . the consistency between eqs.([wb])&([temp ] ) and the mhd theory@xcite clearly indicates that the analytic theory described here incorporates the local equilibrium velocity distribution of the ions . in the following section , we adopt the test particle approach to simulate pesudoheating and the results will be presented and discussed in detail .",
    "we start with a linearly polarized alfvn wave with wave magnetic field vector @xmath37 in order to show that the drift velocity is in @xmath0 direction .",
    "this is the basis of further understanding",

    "the initial velocities of test particles are randomly distributed and possess a maxwellian distribution with thermal speed @xmath1=0.07@xmath49 ( the situations with @xmath1=0.01@xmath49 , 0.03@xmath49 , and 0.15@xmath49 are also discussed later ) .",
    "the numerical scheme is similar to what described in ref.@xcite .",

    "the basic reason causing this difference is the different definition of temperature , i.e. , @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "the one - dimensional maxwellian velocity distribution based on @xmath62 and @xmath1 can be expressed as follows@xcite : @xmath63different definitions of thermal speed or temperature , however , do not affect the final results since self - consistent definition is maintained throughout the previous studies@xcite .",

    "therefore it is very difficult to distinguish the real heating from the pseudoheating due to the restriction of spatial resolution of the instruments and the presence of wave forces ( or their spectra ) .",
    "the suprathermal tail and small bump shown in fig.[fig4](c ) , where the @xmath83 axis scale is different from figs.[fig4](a)-(b ) , corresponds to the accelerated ( suprathermal ) ions due to the wave modes coherence . the bump - on - tail structure may excite plasma instabilities , however , the detailed discussion of these instabilities is beyond the scope of this paper",
    ". it also needs to point out that here we only consider the pseudoheating and investigate the normalized velocity distribution function corresponding to this process while the real heating via nonresonant interaction with alfvn waves always coexists@xcite .",
    "the velocity distribution function , therefore , is supposed to be broader than that shown in fig.[fig4 ] and it is possible that the broadening effects smooth the velocity distribution function and eliminate the bump on the tail . in fig.[fig4](d ) , we investigate the local normalized velocity distribution function based on the statistics of protons in the spatial range @xmath80 .",
    "if the spatial range is too small , there will be insufficient particles to be counted for statistics .",
    "the local statistical mean velocity equals to @xmath83=-0.176@xmath84 which agrees well with the result shown in fig.[fig2](d ) .",
    "the local normalized velocity distribution function in the particles mean - velocity frame at @xmath85 ( as indicated by the white dots ) is in good agreement with the initial maxwellian distribution based on eq.([maxdis ] ) .",
    "the slight difference between these two distribution functions results from the fact that the local statistics are based on a small spatial range ( @xmath80 ) and therefore it can be potentially affected by the effects of wave spectra .",
    "this leads to a slightly broader local velocity distribution .",
    "the result shown in fig.[fig4](d ) indicates that the analytic theory in sec.2 is on the basis of the local equilibrium velocity distribution of the ions .",

    "the solid curve for the magnetic field of a monochromatic alfvn wave is simply a sinusoidal wave .",
    "the dashed and dotted curves represent a spectrum of alfvn waves with 41 wave modes that has random and same phase @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "they can mimic the alfvnic turbulence due to the quasirandom fluctuations of the wave fields .",
    "the amplitude of the magnetic perturbation can be quite large locally , thus may produce some energetic particles that can escape from the constraint of the alfvn waves and contribute to fast particle population in astrophysical and space plasmas . as indicated in fig.[fig42 ] , the larger the magnetic perturbations are , the more effective the distribution functions are broadened .",
    "refs.@xcite suggest that small scale reconnection events occur during the solar flares , which can provide large magnitude spike - like magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "additionally , the cluster observation of surface waves in the ion jets from magnetotail reconnection also shows that @xmath87 can be as high as 0.5 and occasionally even higher@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of the magnetic perturbation associated with alfvn waves can be even larger than the ambient magnetic field in certain cases observed by the _ wind _",
    "figs.[fig42](b)&(c ) also show that the distribution of test particles in the @xmath73-@xmath74 phase space and the wave field perturbations are in antiphase ( @xmath88 phase difference ) due to the fact that the proton motion is parasitic to alfvn waves , indicating an exchange of energy between the particles kinetic energy and the magnetic energy .",
    "therefore fig.[fig42](b ) indicates that the psuedoheating is a consequence of equilibrium mhd system .",
    "it is noteworthy that the parallel electric field and wave damping are not included in the test particle simulations of our current work . in the self - consistent simulations such as hybrid simulations ( i.e. , kinetic description of ions , fluid electrons ) ,",
    "the phase - correlation among the fourier modes could affect , for instance , that the ponderomotive force resulting from the envelope - modulated alfvn waves heat ions through the nonlinear landau damping@xcite and the parallel heating of ions due to the nonlinear landau damping@xcite . in ref.@xcite , the ponderomotive force and beat interaction are identified as the most important nonlinear effects in proton heating by nonlinear field - aligned alfvn waves in the solar coronal holes .",
    "interestingly , they found that the nonlinearity is particularly strong when the wave spectrum consists of counterpropagating modes of equal intensity , even if the intensity is relatively low .",
    "moreover , from the hybrid approach , dissipation processes of the alfvnic turbulence with the broadband wave number spectrum can be different from those of monochromatic alfvn waves , since the former is associated with the density fluctuations , @xmath89 , and the resultant spatial modulation of @xmath90 due to compressive effects of ponderomotive forces@xcite : right - hand polarized alfvnic turbulence with such an envelope modulation can be dissipated due to the nonlinear landau damping , while left - hand polarized alfvnic turbulence with the broadband spectrum is preferentially dissipated by the modulational instability . on the other hand , low - frequency , monochromatic alfvn waves are relatively stable to the linear collisionless dissipations such as landau damping and cyclotron damping , nonlinear wave - wave interactions parametric instabilities are important for the dissipation of these waves .",
    "the decay instability is dominant for dissipation of the right - hand polarized finite - amplitude monochromatic alfvn waves in low @xmath91 plasmas , while the left - hand polarized waves can also be dissipated via the modulational instability@xcite . these wave",
    "damping mechanisms are closely related to the present work ; therefore , in order to study the characteristics of the `` acceleration '' and `` heating '' process in more detail , comprehensive and self - consistent studies are necessary in the future .",
    "ion pseudoheating by low - frequency alfvn waves is investigated based on the comparison between a monochromatic alfvn wave and a wave spectrum .",
    "both analytic and simulation results show that @xmath0 drift plays a principal role in this process and the proton motion is parasitic to alfvn waves .",
    "it indicates the psuedoheating is a consequence of the equilibrium in the mhd system .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the previous studies based on pitch - angle scattering .",
    "more importantly , it provides a simple understanding of the reversible property of this process from @xmath0 drift point of view ; if wave magnetic and electric fields disappear , there will be no drift velocity @xmath92 and therefore no pseudoheating .",
    "we showed that the wave spectra contribute to the broadening of the maxwellian distribution during the pseudoheating , and it is therefore difficult to exclude the apparent temperature @xmath93 from observations due to the low spatial resolution of the instruments .",
    "it is of particular interests to note that the maxwellian shape is more likely to maintain during the pseudoheating under a wave spectrum compared with a monochromatic alfvn wave .",
    "we , therefore can conclude that the kinetic behavior of ions under a monochromatic wave and a wave spectrum is totally different .",
