    "ce- and yb - based @xmath18-electron kondo - lattice ( kl ) systems have shown the most drastic forms of non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behaviour  @xcite . in these heavy - fermion ( hf ) materials ,",
    "the ground state sensitively depends on the balance between two competing interactions , which are both determined by the strength of the @xmath19-conduction electron hybridisation @xmath20 : whereas the kondo interaction leads to a screening of the local moments below a kondo temperature @xmath21 , resulting in a paramagnetic ( pm ) ground state with itinerant @xmath19-electrons , the indirect exchange coupling ( rkky interaction ) can mediate long - range magnetic ordering  @xcite .",
    "+ one of the explanations for such nfl phenomena is the presence of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) at a particular @xmath22 : if the transition temperature @xmath23 of the long - range magnetic order is continuously shifted to zero by an external parameter @xmath24 , e.g. pressure , magnetic field or chemical substitution , a @xmath25 order quantum phase transition ( qpt ) takes place at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , to which a qcp is associated . here ,",
    "the typical length and time scales of order parameter fluctuations diverge when approaching the transition point .",
    "these fluctuations are believed to be responsible for the observed nfl corrections to the fl prediction for the heat capacity @xmath28 , magnetic susceptibility @xmath29 , electrical resistivity @xmath30 etc .",
    "qcps are not the only mechanism to provide nfl behaviour .",
    "if the magnetic order changes from long - range to short - range and disorder comes into play , spatial regions ( also called `` rare regions '' ) can show local magnetic order , although the bulk system is in a pm state  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter fluctuations of these regions can become strong enough to destroy the qpt and can give rise to nfl effects  @xcite . here",
    ", the length scale of order parameter fluctuations becomes finite , while the time scale still diverges . as a consequence in ,",
    "e.g. , the quantum griffiths phase ( qgp ) scenario , power - law corrections , @xmath31 and @xmath5 with @xmath7 , are expected in a broad region across the qcp and not only at the qcp itself  @xcite .",
    "the global phase transition is then smeared  @xcite , as observed in doped ferromagnetic ( fm ) materials , as , e.g. , the itinerant zr@xmath2nb@xmath3zn@xmath32  @xcite , the @xmath33-based hf system urh@xmath2ru@xmath3ge  @xcite and the ce - based  cepd@xmath2rh@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the ground state of such systems depends on several factors and can be very exotic , as in  ceni@xmath2cu@xmath3 , where a percolative cluster scenario has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "+ recently , we reported on the formation of a `` kondo - cluster - glass '' state in cepd@xmath2rh@xmath3  for @xmath34 , caused by the freezing of clusters with predominantly fm coupling : they form below a temperature @xmath35 and freeze at a lower temperature @xmath36  @xcite . in  cepd@xmath2rh@xmath3 ,",
    "the chemical substitution of the ce - ligand pd by rh induces not just a negative volume effect , but , more importantly , it locally increases the hybridisation strength @xmath20 of the cerium @xmath19 electrons , leading to a strong enhancement of the local @xmath21 .",
    "simultaneously , disorder is introduced to the system , which induces a statistical distribution of @xmath21 .",
    "both effects create regions where @xmath18 moments are still unscreened and can form fm clusters because of the rkky interaction  @xcite .    in the temperature region @xmath37 we have observed power - law behaviour of several thermodynamic quantities , i.e. @xmath38 , @xmath12 , @xmath14  @xcite , and we concluded that the quantum griffiths phase scenario might be realised in cepd@xmath2rh@xmath3  for rh content @xmath39 . for @xmath40",
    "the system is too close to the fm long - range order to be considered in the qgp . in this article",
    "we take a closer look at the magnetic susceptibility @xmath9 and magnetisation @xmath0 in single crystals with rh content @xmath41 within the frame of the qgp scenario . + before starting with the analysis of the results , we have to consider that the qgp is restricted to a small region of the temperature - magnetic field ( @xmath42 ) phase diagram .",
    "this region is limited to the ranges @xmath37 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are , respectively , the magnetic fields necessary to destroy the glass state and to remove the effect of the cluster formation ( cf .",
    "inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ) . both @xmath36 and @xmath44",
    "have very low values of the order of mk and mt . to study the dynamic processes in the region close to @xmath46 , @xmath9 was measured down to 0.02  k ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , at a frequency of 113  hz , with a modulation field of @xmath47 t .",
    "the dc magnetisation @xmath0 was measured with a squid ( quantum design ) at high temperatures and with a high - resolution faraday magnetometer , in magnetic fields as high as 11  t and at temperatures down to 0.05  k  ( fig .  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3])@xcite . the magnetic field has been applied along the @xmath48 axis in all the measurements presented here .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the magnetic anisotropy of the system is low for @xmath49  @xcite and poly- and single crystals exhibit similar behaviour  @xcite .",
    "+ in frame ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the real part of the ac susceptibility is plotted as a function of @xmath10 in a double - logarithmic scale for four crystals of  cepd@xmath2rh@xmath3  with @xmath50 . the peak temperature is @xmath36 .    in frame ( b )",
    ", @xmath9 is shown only for the crystal with @xmath46 at different fields .",
    "k has been determined as the temperature where the field - cooled ( fc ) and zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) measurements of @xmath0 split , as illustrated in the inset of the same frame . as in polycrystals",
    ", @xmath9 follows a @xmath52 power - law function above @xmath36 where the exponent @xmath11 varies systematically with @xmath13 between -0.12 and 0.45  @xcite , as expected in the qgp scenario .",
    "the value of the exponents seems to be independent of the impurity phases observed at about 3  k ( see curve for @xmath53 ) .",
    "the negative @xmath11 value for the sample with @xmath46 , different from the one measured in a polycrystal with the same @xmath13 ( @xmath54 ) , suggests that this sample is still too close to the fm instability .",
    "moreover , the error in estimating the composition by energy dispersive x - ray spectrometry amounts to 1 at .",
    "taking into account that the sample with slightly higher rh content @xmath53 shows @xmath55 , it is not possible from this measurement to discern whether the sample with @xmath46 can be considered in the qgp or not .",
    "furthermore , the exponent is affected by the freezing which already takes place at @xmath56  k. focussing on the temperature range between @xmath36 and @xmath35 , the @xmath9 vs @xmath10 plot changes slope slightly at about 3.5  k , and again at about 1.5  k ( indicated by arrows ) .",
    "we have fitted this range to extract @xmath11 , considering that in the 10  mt curve the fit range can be expanded to even lower temperatures .",
    "+ to verify the presence of a qgp in this sample , we have measured @xmath0 vs @xmath8 at different temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the isotherms are shown : in frame ( a ) , the curve at 2  k is plotted together with those for two fm concentrations , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , to emphasise the strong decreasing of the magnetic moment with @xmath13 ; in frame ( b ) , the isotherms at 0.05  k and 2  k are compared .",
    "the magnetisation at 0.05  k shows a very small hysteresis ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , due to freezing at @xmath56  k , and it is far from reaching saturation at 10  t. we consider the value of the coercive field to be @xmath59  t. since @xmath51  k  @xmath60 , we can assume @xmath45 to be close to 12  t , as the magnetic moment @xmath61 at 12  t is only @xmath62 .",
    "it is thus plausible to look for qgp in @xmath0 vs @xmath8 for fields between 0.1 and 12  t. @xmath0 vs @xmath63 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] at three temperatures ; below @xmath36 ( 0.05  k ) , just above it ( 0.5  k ) and close to @xmath35 ( 2  k ) .",
    "the curves follow a power - law behaviour , with an almost constant value of @xmath17 , close to those observed in @xmath12 for the other crystals , as expected in the qgp .",
    "since @xmath0 vs @xmath8 plots are less sensitive to paramagnetic impurities , and for @xmath64 the freezing does not affect the power law , these plots can be considered as signatures of a qgp in  cepd@xmath15rh@xmath16 . + as discussed in the introduction , there is a fundamental difference between the nfl behaviour given by long - range and short - range order fluctuations .",
    "the presence of clusters and the power - law corrections to susceptibility and magnetisation in  cepd@xmath2rh@xmath3  indicate that the expected qpt at @xmath41 is replaced by disordered phases , possibly like the griffiths one .",
