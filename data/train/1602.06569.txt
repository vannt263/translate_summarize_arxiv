    "using methods as elementary as possible , accessible to those having only a basic understanding of scheme theory , we present efficient new proofs of the equivalence of some of the main kinds of smoothness of scheme morphisms .",
    "while smoothness is clearly important in algebraic geometry , there is no general agreement about which among several seemingly different definitions should be chosen as the basic one that best expresses the concept . in certain situations , one approach to smoothness",
    "can be distinctly easier to work with than others , so it is useful to make transitions whenever convenient .",
    "our aim is to make such processes thoroughly transparent .",
    "we innovate by proving key results using machinery so limited that concepts such as dimension , tangent spaces , fibres , regularity and flatness do not appear .",
    "discussion of those , as well as the important topic of tale morphisms , has been relegated to another article on consequences and further characterizations of smoothness .",
    "only trivial facts will be cited , except in many non - essential comments where various concepts and results are presupposed in order to make comparisons with other work .",
    "khler differentials are treated as forming modules rather than sheaves , and will play an important role in proofs . unlike much written in this area , there will be no assumptions or reductions involving noetherianity .",
    "although they are useful for clarifying some aspects of smoothness , grothendieck topologies other than the zariski topology will not be treated here .    stimulus for writing",
    "this article came from examining standard sources selected from a vast literature , notably grtz and wedhorn [ 3 ] and vakil [ 12 ] as well as the encyclopedic stacks project book [ 11 ] and ega [ 1 ] .",
    "the first two provide motivation and additional details , important for elucidating the significance of smoothness . except where noted , our definitions coincide with those of",
    "[ 11 ] . some of the most relevant will be repeated below . for reasons of stability ,",
    "references to [ 11 ] are given in the form [ tag .... ] , and can be consulted on - line . in",
    "[ 11 ] , as in [ 1 ] and many other works ( one interesting survey being [ 8 ] ) , further variations on notions of smoothness appear , often phrased in terms of certain kinds of intersections or using @xmath0-adic topology .",
    "homological methods yield deeper results , some presented in [ 7 ] .",
    "our scope is far more limited .",
    "formal smoothness and standard smoothness will be regarded as properties of morphisms between schemes , to be studied from zariski - local and stalk - local points of view as properties of ( homo)morphisms of commutative rings .",
    "the first of these notions of smoothness , due to grothendieck , has an intrinsic ( presentation - independent ) definition well suited for formal diagrammatic demonstrations .",
    "the other notion , seemingly more concrete , asserts the existence of presentations by generators and relations of a certain form .",
    "precise details are given in the next section .",
    "a different approach , adopted for example in [ 11 ] , takes smoothness to be at heart a property of the sheaf of differentials . to properly formalize the idea , the naive cotangent complex of a morphism [ tag 00s0 ] is introduced",
    "this object is shown in [ tag 031j ] to be in some sense trivial precisely when the morphism is formally smooth .",
    "an example in [ tag 0635 ] , with a morphism not locally of finite type , shows that the full cotangent complex need not behave as well .",
    "however , smooth morphisms are by definition required to be locally finitely presented . in that case , a refined approach to differentials allows formal smoothness to be exploited in a previously unknown way , yielding a proof of the first theorem below .",
    "it then becomes easy to bypass the naive cotangent complex in proofs of results about smoothness , if one is willing to take the foundation stone of the theory to be grothendieck s abstract definition rather than one based explicitly on differentials .    in what follows",
    ", the non - standard term ` around @xmath1 ' pertains to local properties , those that hold on some restriction @xmath2 to affine open subschemes with @xmath3 , and on further such restrictions .",
    "we also write ` at @xmath1 ' for properties that are are even more local , defined from a single map @xmath4 to the stalk at @xmath1 from the stalk at @xmath5 .",
    "such maps are local homomorphisms @xmath6 of local rings . in the terminology",
    "just introduced , and with the definitions of smoothness as given in the next section , the first fundamental result is :    [ fund ] let @xmath7 be a scheme morphism , locally of finite presentation .",
    "for each point @xmath1 of @xmath8 , the following are equivalent : ( a ) @xmath9 is formally smooth around @xmath1 ; ( b ) @xmath9 is standard smooth around @xmath1 ; ( c ) @xmath9 is formally smooth at @xmath1 ; ( d ) @xmath9 is standard smooth at @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath10 satisfying these conditions form the point set of an open subscheme of @xmath8 , the _ smooth locus _ of @xmath9 .",
    "when this is @xmath8 , @xmath9 is said to be smooth . as a byproduct of the proof techniques ,",
    "the idea of studying smoothness from given generators and relations can be justified .",
    "it will be clear after the proof of that it is straightforward to test at stalks .",
    "we even obtain a formula , too cumbersome to be of practical use , for the smooth locus .",
    "some open subsets of @xmath11 needed just below will be principal open sets @xmath12 , @xmath13 , while others are complements of closed sets @xmath14 , @xmath0 an ideal of @xmath15 .",

    "each @xmath21 , a jacobian determinant , and @xmath0 , an ideal of the form @xmath22 , is defined by an explicit formula involving the given @xmath23 $ ] and their formal partial derivatives @xmath24 .",
    "the final section concerns a distinctly deeper fundamental result : an arbitrary scheme morphism @xmath25 is formally smooth precisely when it is locally formally smooth , by which we mean this holds around all points of @xmath8 , with ` around ' as defined above . under an assumption that includes the case where @xmath9 is locally of finite type ,",
    "we show that elementary methods , carefully deployed , yield a proof technically simpler than previously known ones .",
    "all rings considered will be commutative algebras ( with @xmath26 , and allowing the case @xmath27 ) over a ring called @xmath28 .",
    "maps between rings , including derivations , are taken to be @xmath28-linear .",
    "as in [ tag 00th ] , a ring morphism @xmath29 is _ formally smooth _ if , in the category of @xmath28-algebras , every morphism @xmath30 , where @xmath0 is an ideal of @xmath31 with @xmath32 , lifts to ( or factors through ) a morphism @xmath33 . in other words ,",
    "the defining property is that all these @xmath34 induce surjective functions @xmath35 .",
    "a simple observation , not needed below , motivates the definition . on dropping the assumption @xmath32 , when @xmath15 is formally smooth over @xmath28",
    "there is instead a lift @xmath36 , then in turn a lift @xmath37 , and so on .",
    "one can easily interpose @xmath38 and other terms .",
    "thus , after countably many choices , the given @xmath30 factors through @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the inverse limit @xmath41 the @xmath0-adic completion of @xmath31 .",
    "formal smoothness of a scheme morphism @xmath7 has an analogous definition [ tag 02gz ] , best stated relative to the category of schemes over @xmath42 [ tag 01jx ] .",
    "we say @xmath7 ( or even just @xmath8 ) is _ formally smooth _ if every morphism @xmath43 over @xmath42 , where @xmath32 , induces a surjective function @xmath44 .",
    "among various results that are trivial consequences of the definition , we note that of [ tag 02h3 ] : every restriction of @xmath25 to a morphism @xmath2 between open subschemes of @xmath8 and @xmath42 is formally smooth if @xmath9 is .",
    "it is also clear that any such restriction @xmath2 is formally smooth precisely when @xmath45 is .",
    "further properties , not needed here , show the robustness of this notion .",
    "the really striking fact , mentioned earlier , is that the formal smoothness of a morphism turns out to be determined by local properties alone ( it is local in the sense of [ tag 01ss ] ) .",
    "one can find further details of interest , in the context of algebraic spaces , in [ tag 049r ] .",
    "given an explicit finite presentation of @xmath15 over @xmath28 , say @xmath46 , where @xmath47 denotes the polynomial ring @xmath48 $ ] , the image in @xmath15 of any @xmath49 in @xmath47 is also called @xmath49 when the meaning is clear .",
    "we prefer to use the name @xmath50 for the ideal @xmath51 of @xmath15 , reserving @xmath0 for other uses .",
    "the cases @xmath52 or @xmath53 are allowed , rewording where necessary .",
    "departing slightly from the presentation - dependent definition in [ tag 00t6 ] , we say a ring morphism @xmath29 , or @xmath15 as an @xmath28-algebra , is _ standard smooth _ over @xmath28 if @xmath15 can be presented as above , where @xmath54 and the @xmath55 matrix @xmath56 with @xmath57-entry @xmath58 maps to an invertible matrix over @xmath15 , or equivalently @xmath59 is invertible in @xmath15 .",
    "also say @xmath29 is _ essentially standard smooth _ if @xmath15 is isomorphic to a localization of some standard smooth @xmath28-algebra .",

    ", @xmath9 is said to be _ locally standard smooth _ , a property with many desirable consequences .",
    "maps between stalks can not be expected to be finitely presented .",
    "thus , when @xmath9 is said to be _ standard smooth at @xmath1 _ , for some @xmath10 , we mean that the induced map @xmath4 is essentially standard smooth . here @xmath67 plays the role of @xmath28 .",

    "this follows at once , using the open cover @xmath71 of @xmath11 .",
    "the usual differential on @xmath72 $ ] is @xmath73 , where to be definite the @xmath74 ( in order ) are taken to be the elements of the canonical basis of the module @xmath75 . with @xmath76 and @xmath77 as before , there is a derivation @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , the @xmath15-module of differentials , is the quotient of @xmath80 by the submodule generated by @xmath81 .",
    "it suffices to impose the relations @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , since all @xmath84 act as 0 on @xmath79 , so @xmath85 .",
    "however , finiteness of the number of generators and relations is clearly non - essential here , and indeed throughout this whole section .",

    "examples of such morphisms , not locally finite , are easily found using transcendental extensions of fields . with ` around ' in the sense defined in the introduction ,",
    "the result we prove is :    [ ffund ] for every scheme morphism @xmath270that is locally essentially of finite type , the following are equivalent : ( a ) @xmath9 is formally smooth ; ( b ) @xmath9 is formally smooth around all points of @xmath8 .",
    "the equivalence is in fact true for arbitrary @xmath9 , but the given hypothesis on @xmath9 is sufficiently general to include all situations that normally occur , and significantly simplifies the proof . in this context",
    "it is usual to cite a result on the triviality of ech cohomology for quasicoherent sheaves on affine schemes , but we do not do so .",
    "some historical background is given for those interested .",
    "the very last ( fourth ) issue of [ 1 ] , vol .",
    "4 states the equivalence in full generality as proposition ( 17.1.6 ) , but the proof cites something that requires @xmath9 to be locally of finite presentation .",
    "grothendieck [ 4 , remarque 9.5.8 ] ( also see [ 9 ] ) discussed that gap , found soon after publication .",
    "he stated that there is no problem for locally finite morphisms , adding that the general result would follow from a proof of a conjecture on the structure of locally projective modules .",
    "a few years later , in 1971 , the deep analysis carried out by raynaud and gruson [ 10 ] , building on earlier work of kaplansky [ 6 ] , implied a full solution , once some technical details had been corrected in [ 5 ] .",
    "we ignore all this , and later related work , as the case we treat can be handled using only rudimentary machinery .",
    "this provides an instructive contrast to more conventional methods . at the end",
    ", adjustments are made via partitions of unity analogous to ones used in complex analysis to prove certain theorems of dolbeault and de rham ",

    "just as in [ tab 01up ] , a one - line calculation ( omitted ) yields :    [ torsor ] let @xmath271 , where @xmath32 . given a ring morphism @xmath272 , regard @xmath0 as an @xmath28-module via the induced map @xmath273 composed with the natural action of @xmath174 on @xmath0 .",
    "then the morphisms @xmath274 that induce @xmath275 are the functions of the form @xmath276 for which @xmath277 is an @xmath28-derivation .",
    "one direction is trivial , from observations made in section  2 . given ( b ) , one sees from the hypotheses that for each @xmath10 there are affine sets @xmath278 and @xmath279 with @xmath3 such that @xmath49 restricts to a formally smooth morphism @xmath2 that is essentially of finite type .",
    "using notation @xmath271 , where @xmath32 , and @xmath280 , with underlying set identified throughout with that of @xmath281 , it must be shown that any morphism @xmath282 factors through the usual @xmath283 .",

    "we write the localization @xmath289 as @xmath290 and use a similar convention for the @xmath174-module @xmath0 , but not more generally .",

    "each corresponding ring homomorphism @xmath297 is regarded as forming a morphism @xmath298 of @xmath299-algebras , with @xmath300 essentially finite over @xmath299 . by the formal smoothness assumption",

    "each @xmath322 is of the form @xmath323 , for some chosen @xmath324 that minimizes @xmath325 , with @xmath202 implicitly determined by the index @xmath326 .",

    "the projection @xmath337 fixes @xmath329 , and the above factorization of @xmath319 gives a map with @xmath338 .",
    "a multiple of the composition lifts to a map @xmath339 , @xmath340 .",
    "restriction to @xmath329 then yields an @xmath299-linear derivation @xmath341 which , composed with @xmath342 , is @xmath343 .",
    "as @xmath344 may later be increased further , note that for @xmath345 we have @xmath346    in much the same way that @xmath319 was defined , one can find a derivation @xmath347 that is the difference of two homomorphisms @xmath315 and , when calculated on the stalks of @xmath348 , which are algebras over both @xmath299 and @xmath349 , has the formula @xmath350",
