    "in order to calculate the partition function for a quantum field , the matsubara prescription is equivalent to a path - integral calculated on  @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a circle of circumference @xmath3 this non - trivial result was demonstrated by polchinski @xcite at the one - loop level and has been assumed in higher order @xcite . under this perspective , taking euclidian theories , the dolan and jackiw approach @xcite can be a useful method to perform calculations for confined ( bosonic or fermionic ) fields , and according to the matsubara formalism the boundary conditions over the fields are those consistent with the so called kms ( kubo , martin and schwinger ) conditions , stating periodic ( antiperiodic ) conditions for bosons ( fermions ) .",
    "such a topological result has actually been generalized to treat different physical situations in which fields are confined in higher space dimensions , considering the matsubara mechanism on a @xmath4 topology , describing time ( temperature ) and space confinement @xcite . along the same lines , but considering the thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) formalism , which is an operator formalism equivalent to the matsubara approach @xcite for systems in equilibrium , a generalization of the bogoliubov transformation has been introduced to deal with confined boson fields in space coordinates at finite temperature , being an effective tool to derive different aspects of the casimir effect for the electromagnetic field confined between two plates @xcite . in this context",
    "one interesting physical result is brought about : the casimir effect is described by a process of condensation of the field , thus shedding a new light on the nature of the quantum vacuum and the origin of the casimir effect . in this paper",
    "we extend this approach introduced for boson fields in ref .",
    "@xcite to fermion fields , and we apply it to the casimir effect of a free massless fermionic field between two plates , in a wave - guide and in a box .    in the realm of the quantum field theory ,",
    "the casimir effect was first proposed as a result of the vacuum fluctuation of the electromagnetic field confined between two plates with separation @xmath5 , defined by the dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the effect was an attractive force between the plates given by the negative pressure @xmath6 ( we use natural units : @xmath7 ) @xcite . over the decades",
    ", the casimir effect has been applied to different geometries , fields and physical conditions , enjoying a remarkable popularity @xcite and raising interest , in particular , in the context of microelectronics @xcite as a practical tool for switching devices .",
    "the effect of temperature was first studied by lifshitz @xcite who presented an alternative derivation for the casimir force , including an analysis of the dielectric nature of the material between the plates .",
    "actually , the effect of temperature on the interaction between the conducting parallel plates may be significant for separations greater than @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "for this physical set - up of plates , the full analysis of the thermal energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic  field was carried out by brown and maclay @xcite , performing the calculation of the casimir free - energy by using the green s function ( the local formulation ) written in a conformally invariant way @xcite .",
    "one of our proposal here is to derive the fermionic counterpart of the brown and maclay s formula , but for a more general situation of confinement : we consider not only the two plates , but also the case of confinement within a @xmath0-dimensional box .",
    "casimir effect for a fermionic field is of interest in considering , for instance , the structure of proton in particle physics ; thus its physical appeal .",
    "in particular , in the phenomenological mit bag model @xcite , quarks are confined in a small space region in such a way that there is no fermionic current outside that region .",
    "the fermion field then fulfills the so - called bag model boundary condition .",
    "the casimir effect in such a small region , of the order of @xmath9 , is important to define the process of deconfinement in heavy ion collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , giving rise to the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the gluon field contribution for the casimir effect is , up to the color quantum numbers , the same as for the electromagnetic field . for the quark field ,",
    "the problem has been often addressed by considering the case of two parallel plates @xcite .    as first demonstrated by johnson @xcite , for plates ,",
    "the fermionic casimir force is attractive as in the case of the electromagnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "depending on the geometry of confinement , the nature of the casimir force can change .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for a spherical cavity and of the casimir - boyer model , using mixed boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field , such that the force is repulsive @xcite .",
    "therefore , the analysis considering fermions in a wave - guide ( confinement in two - dimensions ) and in a 3-dimensional box ( confinement in 3-dimensions ) may be of interest .",
    "we avoid here the approach based on the sum of quantum modes , that was so important in the calculation of the brown and maclay .",
    "using , alternately , the method developed earlier @xcite , we perform the calculation of the non - trivial problem of the dirac field in a finite volume with the compactification in an @xmath0-dimensional box , at finite temperature .",
    "we hope then that this possibility for calculations may be useful in the general problem of fermions fulfilling boundary conditions , which are some times described by coupling with a static background field @xcite .    in order to proceed",
    ", we have to adapt the methodology of calculations discussed earlier @xcite , to encompass a generalized bogoliubov transformation for fermion fields with the mit bag model boundary condition ; equivalent to an antiperiodic boundary condition @xcite .",
    "this is presented in section 2 , where we derive the energy - momentum tensor for the fermion field at @xmath10 , resulting , as an example , in the stefan - boltzmann law .",
    "this is the usual calculation of tfd for fermions ; however it can also be interpreted as a confinement in the time axis , in such a way that the field is under anti - periodic boundary conditions . using then this methodology for a euclidian geometry",
    ", we can envisage a space compactification .",
    "the usual expression of the casimir effect is thus calculated , considering a proper modified bogoliubov transformation which will describe the confinement in the z - axis .",
    "the familiarity with this kind of calculation for these already known results will suggest to us a general form for a bogoliubov transformation to describe space compactification in arbitrary dimensions ; a subject developed in section 3 . in section 4 , we consider the first application of the energy - momentum tensor derived in section 3 : we calculate the casimir effect considering that the fermionic field is confined between two plates at finite temperature . as a particular consequence ,",
    "we reach the expression derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for the casimir energy , following the matsubara formalism . in section 5",
    "we address the problem of the casimir effect for a rectangular wave guide , and some particular cases are analyzed , resulting , for instance , in an attractive or repulsive casimir force on opposite faces depending on the relative magnitude of the edges of the wave - guide transversal section . in section 6",
    "we consider the field confined in a parallelepiped box , showing similar aspects as those appearing in wage - guides .",
    "we also determine the temperature at which the casimir pressure in a cubic box changes sign , estimating its value when the edge of the cube is of the order of the proton diameter . in section 7",
    "some concluding remarks are presented .",
    "the general approach to be used here can be addressed through the following prescription , taken as a generalization of the tfd formalism @xcite .",

    "it is curious that , in the units we are using , the casimir pressure is three times the energy for parallel plates , they are equal in a square wave - guide , while in a cubic box one has @xmath188 .    changing the relative magnitude of the edges of the parallelepiped box leads to similar effects as in the case of the rectangular wave - guide .",
    "for example , taking @xmath189 and defining @xmath190 , one can show that @xmath191 vanishes for @xmath192 , being negative for @xmath193 and positive for @xmath163 .",
    "however , as in the case of the wave - guide , @xmath161 ( @xmath194 in the present situation ) will be negative whenever @xmath195 .    to treat the effect of temperature in the case of a box , all four coordinates in the minkowski space have to be compactified by considering @xmath196 in eq .",

    ", one finds that the casimir pressure changes from negative to positive values when the ratio @xmath127 passes through the value @xmath198 .",
    "the critical curves , @xmath199 , for all symmetrical cases analyzed here ( parallel plates , square wave - guide and cubic box ) appear in figure [ figt ] .",
    "one notices that the behaviors of @xmath200 , in all three cases , are very similar one to each other , with @xmath201 scaling with the inverse fourth power of the relevant length @xmath5 .    on the basis of these results",
    ", we can estimate the temperature at which the casimir pressure in a cubic box changes from negative to positive values considering the edge of the cube of the order of confining lengths for hadronic matter .",
    "such an estimative provides a crude idea of the importance of casimir effect in the deconfinement transition for hadrons .",
    "taking @xmath202 , a length of the order of hadron radius , one finds @xmath203 from quark degrees of freedom considering only one flavor quark . for a real hadron",
    "there are two flavors , @xmath204 and @xmath0 , each with 3 colors and an octet of gluons . in order to calculate the casimir energy and pressure , the results for bosonic and fermionic fields have to be combined .",
    "in this paper we have presented a generalization of the bogoliubov transformation in order to describe a massless fermion field compactified in a @xmath0-dimensional box at finite temperature .",
    "we write the ( traceless ) energy - momentum tensor from which we calculate and compare explicit expressions for the casimir pressure and the casimir energy , corresponding to different cases of confinement .",
    "the casimir pressure at zero temperature for the cases of two parallel plates , square wave - guides and cubic boxes are negative ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) , imposing then an attractive force on all faces of the volume confining the fermionic field . on the other hand , for rectangular wave - guides and parallelepiped boxes",
    "the pressure on opposite faces can be made positive , representing a repulsive force , by appropriately choosing the ratios between the edges of the rectangle and between the edges of the cube .",
    "however , at zero temperature , one can not make positive the pressure for all opposite faces of the wave - guide or of the box simultaneously ; this can be achieved only by raising the temperature sufficiently .",
    "we have calculated the casimir pressure at finite temperature for the cases of two parallel plates , square wave - guides and cubic boxes and determined the critical curves for these transitions from negative to positive pressures ( see figure [ figt ] ) . since repulsive casimir force can have a direct influence on the description of quark deconfinement , we have estimated this critical temperature for a cubic box of edge equal to @xmath205 ( which is the order of magnitude of nuclear dimensions ) obtaining @xmath206 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that these results are only an estimate since these are based on the presence of one fermion flavor field in a cubic box . for realistic calculations ,",
    "a spherical geometry with full account of the color and flavor degrees of freedom has to be considered .",
    "it is important to stress the simplicity of these calculations , that is clear by comparing with the known results for the fermion casimir effect ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "we have avoided usual procedures , the intricate method based on the sum of the quantum modes of the fields , satisfying some given boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , instead of the sum of modes , we have used the generalized bogoliubov transformation to define the casimir effect which provides an elegant physical interpretation of the effect as a consequence of the condensation in the vacuum for the fermion field ( in a similar fashion as was carried out for the case of bosons @xcite ) .",
    "taking advantages of these practical proposals , the method developed here can be useful for calculations involving other geometries with spherical or cylindrical symmetries .",
    "this analysis will be developed in more detail elsewhere .",
