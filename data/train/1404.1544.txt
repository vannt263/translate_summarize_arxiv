    "revisions to the review of particle properties , by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , and contributions to recent baryon spectroscopy workshops @xcite have emphasized the fact that poles , and not breit - wigner parameters , properly determine and quantify resonance properties linking scattering theory and qcd . however , the optimal method for extracting pole parameters , from single - channel t - matrices , remains an open question .",
    "experimentalists are quite familiar with fits to data using breit - wigner functions ( either with constant parameters and very general backgrounds , or with energy dependent masses and widths ) , but are less experienced when complex energy poles are desired . at present , poles are usually extracted from theoretical single or multi - channel models , which are first solved with free parameters fitted to the data .",
    "only then is an array of standard pole extraction methods applied : analytic continuation of the model functions into the complex energy plane @xcite , speed plot @xcite , time delay @xcite , n / d method @xcite , regularization procedure @xcite , etc .",
    "however , this often requires continuing an obtained analytic solution , which implicitly contains both singular and regular ( background ) parts , into the complex energy plane .",
    "consequently , the analytic form of the full solution , and its pole parameters , vary from model to model and the pole - background separation method requires an intimate knowledge of the underlying model .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have presented a new approach to quantifying pole parameters of single - channel processes , based on a laurent expansion of partial - wave t - matrices in the vicinity of the real axis . instead of using the conventional power - series description of the non - singular part of the laurent expansion , we have represented this using a convergent series of pietarinen functions .",
    "as the analytic structure of the non - singular part is usually well understood ( including physical cuts with branch points at inelastic thresholds , and unphysical cuts in the negative energy plane ) , we find that one pietarinen series per cut represents the analytic structure fairly reliably .",
    "the number of terms in each pietarinen series is determined by the quality of the fit .",
    "the method has been tested in two ways : on a toy model constructed from two known poles , various background terms , and two physical cuts , and on several sets of realistic @xmath0n elastic energy - dependent partial - wave amplitudes ( gwu / said - @xcite , and dubna - mainz - taipei - @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that the method is robust and stable , using up to three pietarinen series , and is particularly convenient in fits to single - energy solutions , which are more directly tied to experiment . apart from its ease of use",
    ", it provides a tool for the extraction and comparison of pole properties from different analyses .",
    "there have been several recent studies of model - dependence in single - energy photoproduction amplitude reconstruction  @xcite ( both helicity and multipole ) , with extensions to other reactions as well  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the our expansion method enables us to self - consistently analyze and compare results from different approaches , as described below .",
    "here we have applied the new approach to determine pole positions and residues from single - pion photoproduction multipoles .",
    "the method has been applied to energy - dependent and single - energy multipole fits generated by the maid and gwu / said groups for eight dominant multipoles .",
    "we show that the number and properties of poles extracted from photoproduction data correspond very well to results from @xmath0n elastic data and values cited by particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite .",
    "the photoproduction residues provide new information for the electromagnetic current at the pole position , which is independent of background parameterizations used in the breit - wigner approach .    with pole positions and residues , confidently determined for maid and",
    "said ed solutions , we have further evaluated the photo - decay amplitudes at the pole positions and made a comparison with other very recent analyses .",
    "below , in section ii , we give an overview of the expansion method . in section iii",
    ", this method is applied to both energy - dependent and single - energy results from the maid and said groups for eight dominant multipoles . at this point",
    "we also discuss our extended error analysis . in section iv , we summarize and discuss our results for each partial wave . in section",
    "v , we present our photo - decay amplitudes and compare them to other recent extractions . finally , in section vi we summarize our results and conclude with prospects for further work .",
    "for the convenience of the reader , in this section we outline the laurent+pietarinen ( l+p ) method , which is given a detailed description in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the starting point of our method is a generalization of the laurent expansion , applied to multipoles , using the mittag - leffler theorem @xcite , a theorem expressing a function in terms of its @xmath2 first order poles and an entire function : @xmath3    here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are residua and pole positions for the i - th pole respectively , and @xmath6 is a regular function in the whole complex plane .",
    "it is important to note that this expansion is not a representation of the unknown function @xmath7 in the full complex energy plane , but is restricted to the part of the complex energy plane where the expansion converges , and is defined by the area of convergence of the laurent expansion .",
    "if we choose poles as expansion points , the laurent series converge on the open annulus around each pole , where the center of the annulus is the pole position .",
    "the outer radius of the annulus extends to the position of the next singularity ( such as a nearby pole ) .",
    "thus , our laurent expansion converges on a sum of circles located at the poles , and this part of the complex energy plane in principle includes the real axis .",
    "therefore , fitting the expansion ( [ eq : laurent ] ) to the experimental data on the real axis , can in principle give the exact values of the scattering matrix poles .",
    "the novelty of our approach is a particular choice for the non - pole contribution @xmath8 , based on an expansion method used by pietarinen in the context of @xmath9 elastic scattering analysis . before proceeding ,",
    "we briefly review this method .",
    "a specific type of conformal mapping technique has been proposed and introduced by ciulli @xcite and pietarinen @xcite , and used in the karlsruhe - helsinki partial wave analysis @xcite as an efficient expansion of invariant amplitudes .",
    "it was later used by a number of authors for solving various problems in scattering and field theory @xcite , but not applied to the pole search prior to our recent study  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the use of conformal mapping , and this method in particular , can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "if @xmath10 is a general , unknown analytic function having a cut starting at @xmath11 , then it can be represented in a power series of  pietarinen functions \" in the following way :    @xmath12    with @xmath13 and @xmath14 acting as tuning parameters and coefficients of the pietarinen function , @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the essence of the approach is the fact that a set @xmath16 forms a complete set of functions defined on the unit circle in the complex energy plane having a branch cut starting at @xmath17 .",
    "the analytic form of the function is , at the beginning , undefined .",
    "the final form of the analytic function @xmath10 is obtained by introducing the rapidly convergent power series with real coefficients , and the degree of the expansion is automatically determined in fitting the input data . in the exercise of ref.@xcite , as many as 50 terms were used ; in the present case , covering a more narrow energy range , fewer terms are required .      the analytic structure of each partial wave is well known , with poles parameterizing resonant contributions , cuts in the physical region starting at thresholds of elastic and all possible inelastic channels , plus t - channel , u - channel and nucleon exchange contributions quantified with corresponding negative energy cuts .",
    "however , the explicit analytic form of each cut contribution remains to be determined .",
    "instead of guessing the exact analytic form , we propose to use one pietarinen series to represent each cut , with the number of terms determined by the quality of the fit to the input data . in principle",
    ", we have one pietarinen series per cut , with known branch - points @xmath18 , and coefficients determined by the fit to a real physical process . in practice , we have too many cuts ( especially in the negative energy range ) , thus we reduce their number by dividing them in two categories : all negative energy cuts are approximated with only one , effective negative energy cut represented by one ( pietarinen ) series ( we denote its branch point as @xmath19 ) , while each physical cut is represented by a separate series with branch - points ( @xmath20 ) determined by the physics of the process . in our present analysis ,",
    "we fit all partial waves starting at the pion threshold . therefore we fix our second branch point , @xmath21 to the pion threshold at @xmath22  mev . for the third branch point",
    "@xmath23 we will compare results when a physical branch point is either fixed or fitted .",
    "further branch points were found to be unnecessary in our present data analysis .    in summary ,",
    "the set of equations which define the laurent expansion + pietarinen series method ( l+p method ) is :    @xmath24    as our input data are on the real axes , the fit is performed only on this dense subset of the complex energy plane .",
    "all pietarinen parameters in set of equations ( [ eq : laurent - pietarinen ] ) are determined by the fit .",
    "we observe that the class of input functions which may be analyzed with this method is quite extensive .",
    "one may either fit partial - wave amplitudes obtained from theoretical models , or possibly experimental data directly . in either case , the t - matrix is represented by this set of equations ( [ eq : laurent - pietarinen ] ) , and minimization is usually carried out in terms of @xmath25 .      while the fit strategy outlined in eqs.(3 ) implies the use of purely real branch points , we know that there are , in principle , also complex branch points in the complex energy plane .",
    "this feature can be seen simply starting from three - body unitarity conditions  @xcite .",
    "however , real or complex branch points describe different physical situations .",
    "if the branch points @xmath19 , @xmath21 .... are real numbers , this means that our background contributions are defined by stable initial and final state particles .",
    "all resonance contributions to the observed process are created by intermediate isobar resonances ; all other initial and final state contributions are given by stable particles , and are described by pietarinen expansions with real branch point coefficients . from experience ,",
    "we know that this is not true : a three - body final state is always created , provided that the energy balance allows for it , and in three - body final states we typically do have a contribution from one stable particle ( nucleon or pion ) , and many other combinations of two - body resonant sub - states , such as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "these resonant sub - states produce complex branch points .",
    "as will be demonstrated below , we claim that the single - channel character of the l+p method prevents us from establishing , with certainty , which mechanism dominates . specifically , with only single - channel information available , we have two alternatives : either we obtain a good fit with an extra resonance and stable initial and final state particles ( real branch points ) , or we may obtain a good fit with one resonance fewer , and a complex branch point . having only single - channel data ,",
    "we are not able to distinguish between the two . this effect was already noted , in the context of the jlich model , with a @xmath27n complex branch point interfering and intermixing with the @xmath29 resonance signature , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one advantage of the pietarinen expansion method is its simple extension to complex branch points .",
    "we can check the above statements through applications of the l+p method to the photoproduction multipole @xmath30 , connected to the @xmath31 partial wave from elastic pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "fits to photoproduction data , particularly pion and kaon photoproduction , have been significantly advanced with the availability of new and precise measurements of polarization observables ( both single- and double - polarization ) .",
    "this has revived the study of amplitude reconstruction from data with minimal theoretical input .",
    "however , significant discrepancies do still remain in comparisons of the major analyses .",
    "results are generally reported either as energy - dependent ( ed ) fits , giving a functional representation of the amplitudes over some extended energy range , or as single - energy ( se ) solution , which analyze data in narrow bins of energy . in the se case , a significant variation is possible , as a given bin does not generally contain a sufficient set of observables to uniquely determine an amplitude .",
    "some constraints from the underlying ed fit are usually necessary to obtain a fit .",
    "still , these se fits do give a better representation of the data and can give hints of structure possibly missing in the global ed fit .",
    "it is therefore of interest to find a method of extracting resonance information from these , less smooth , sets of amplitudes . in the ed case ,",
    "if one has the fit function , it is in principle possible to locate poles from a mapping of the amplitude in the complex energy plane .    in this paper",
    "we use the flexibility of the proposed l+p method ( usable for both theoretical and experimental input ) , to extract pole parameters ( pole positions and residues ) for two well - known sets of ed and se photoproduction amplitudes : the maid@xcite and gwu / said @xcite results for single - pion photoproduction .",
    "electric and magnetic multipole amplitudes are analyzed in the fits .",
    "we use three pietarinen functions ( one with a branch - point in the unphysical region to represent all left - hand cuts , and two with branch - points in the physical region , to represent the dominant inelastic channels ) , combined with the minimal number of poles .",
    "in addition , we allow the possibility that one of the branch points becomes a complex number , accounting for all three - body final states in an effective manner .",
    "we generally start with 5 pietarinen terms per decomposition , and the anticipated number of poles ( one for most channels , two for @xmath32 ) .",
    "the discrepancy criteria are defined below in terms of reduced @xmath33 for se and its analog - discrepancy parameter @xmath34 for ed solutions .",
    "this quantity is minimized using minuit and the quality of the fit is also visually inspected by comparing the fitting function with fitted data .",
    "if the fit is unsatisfactory ( discrepancy parameters are too high , or fit visually does not reproduce the fitted data ) , at first the number of pietarinen terms is increased and , if this does not help , the number of poles is increased by one",
    ". the fit is repeated , and the quality of the fit is re - estimated .",
    "this procedure is continued until we have reached a satisfactory fit .",
    "pole positions , residues , and pietarinen coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are our fitting parameters . however ,",
    "in the strict spirit of the method , pietarinen branch points @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 should not be fitting parameters ; we have declared that each known cut should be represented by its own pietarinen series , fixed to known physical branch points .",
    "while this would be ideal , in practice the application is somewhat different .",
    "we can never include all physical cuts from the multi - channel process .",
    "instead , we represent them by a smaller subset .",
    "thus , in our model , pietarinen branch points @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 are not generally constants ; we have explored the effect of allowing them to vary as fitting parameters . in the following , we shall demonstrate that when searched , the branch points in the physical region still naturally converge towards branch - points which belong to channels which dominate particular partial waves , but may not actually correspond to them exactly .",
    "the proximity of the fit results to exact physical branch points describes the  goodness of the fit \" , namely it tells us how well certain combinations of thresholds are indeed approximating a partial wave .",
    "and this , together with the choice of the degree of the pietarinen polynomial , represents the model dependence of our method .",
    "we do not , of course , claim that our method is entirely model independent .",
    "however , the method chooses the simplest function with the given analytic properties which fits the data , and increases the complexity of the function only when the data require it .      in our principal paper @xcite we have tested the validity of the model on a number of well known @xmath0n amplitudes , and concluded that the method is very robust and stable .",
    "however , in that paper we did not present an error analysis , deferring it to the forthcoming paper .",
    "we have fulfilled this promise in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we repeat its essence for the convenience of the reader .    for energy - dependent solutions ,",
    "we introduce the discrepancy or deviation parameter per data point @xmath34 ( the substitute for @xmath25 per data point , @xmath33 , when analyzing experimental data ) in the following way :    @xmath40\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the number of energies , and errors of energy - dependent solutions are introduced as :    @xmath42    when errors of the input amplitudes are not given , and one wants to make a minimization , errors have to be  defined \" .",
    "there are two simple ways to do it : either to assign a constant error to each data point , or introduce an energy - dependent error as a certain percentage of the given value . however , both definitions have drawbacks .",
    "for the first recipe only high - valued points are favored , while in the latter case low - valued points tend to be almost exactly reproduced .",
    "we find neither of these to be satisfactory , thus we follow prescriptions chosen by the gwu and mainz groups , and use a sum of constant and energy dependent errors .    in the l+p method , we consider both statistical and systematic errors .",
    "statistical errors are simply taken over from the minuit program , which is used for minimization .",
    "it is shown separately in all tables as the first term .",
    "systematic errors are the errors of the method itself , and require a more detailed explanation . by construction",
    "it is clear that the method has its natural limitations .",
    "our laurent decomposition contains only two branch points in the physical region , and this is far from enough in a realistic case .",
    "functions representing the multipole amplitudes , in principle containing more than two branch points , will in our model be approximated by a different analytic function containing only two .",
    "this approximation will be the main source of our errors .",
    "therefore , we define the following procedure for quantifying systematic errors :    * we completely release the first ( unphysical ) branch point @xmath19 , as this represents a sum of many background contributions . *",
    "we keep the first physical branch point @xmath21 fixed at @xmath43 mev ( the @xmath0n threshold ) because we know that this threshold branch point should always be present .",
    "* the error analysis is done by varying the remaining physical branch point @xmath23 in two ways : + a : :    we fix the third branch point @xmath23 to the threshold of    the dominant inelastic channel for the chosen partial wave ( for    instance @xmath44 threshold for s - wave ) if only one    inelastic channel is important , or in case of several equally    important inelastic processes we perform several fits with the    @xmath23 branch point fixed to each threshold in succession .",
    "b : :    we release the third branch point @xmath23 completely    allowing minuit to find an effective branch point representing all    inelastic channels .",
    "it is clear that if only one channel is dominant ,    the result of the fit will be very close to the dominant inelastic    channel ( see @xmath45    ( @xmath46 vs. @xmath47 ) or    otherwise in some effective location ( see all other partial waves ) * we average results of the fit , and obtain a standard deviation    the list of all values for the branch point @xmath23 is given in the appendix . +   +",
    "the quality of our fits for the ed solutions is measured by the deviation @xmath34 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ def : d ] ) and ( [ def : err ] ) . +   + for se solutions we use the statistical errors and",
    "obtain the standard @xmath33 definition : @xmath48\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are standard statistical errors of the se solutions , real and imaginary parts respectively .",
    "we have analyzed 24 partial wave amplitudes ( electric and magnetic multipoles ) from maid and said solutions up to @xmath51 waves . from this large number of results we have selected 8 important multipoles for detailed discussions : @xmath52 for the rest of the multipoles , we will present and discuss only the basic results . +   + in tables [ tab : pole1 ] and [ tab : pole2 ] and in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] - [ fig4 ] , we summarize results of all our fits for real branch points . we performed the analyses for ed and se multipoles of the gwu / said cm12 solution @xcite and the maid maid2007 solution @xcite .",
    "+   + tables [ tab : paramed ] and [ tab : paramses ] , given in the appendix , summarize the results of the pietarinen expansion parameters for real branch points .",
    "we show three branch points @xmath53 and the deviation @xmath34 in case of ed solutions and the @xmath33 per data points in case of se solutions .",
    "the latter ones should have a @xmath33 close to 1 .",
    "however , as the se points are not always gaussian distributed data points , the @xmath33 values are generally in the range of @xmath54 . for the ed solutions we have used an error definition , taking into account relative and absolute errors of the order of @xmath55",
    "therefore , for a good fit , the deviation @xmath34 is much smaller , in the range of @xmath56 . as already discussed in sect .",
    "b , we have estimated the stability of our fits and the variation of the resonance parameters by applying 3 or 4 different assumptions for the effective @xmath57 branch point . +   + in tables [",
    "tab : pole1 ] and [ tab : pole2 ] , we present our results on the pole parameters of the nucleon resonances @xmath58 and @xmath59 that we found in our analysis .",
    "these are the pole positions @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 as well as @xmath63 residues in terms of magnitude and phase , @xmath64 .",
    "note , that the photoproduction residues , listed here , are not the residues of a @xmath63 @xmath65-matrix , but residues of the electromagnetic multipoles @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which carry a dimension , e.g. mfm .",
    "therefore , we use mfm  gev as a convenient dimension of @xmath68 .",
    "+   + in the following , we discuss our results in detail for each partial wave : +   + the @xmath69 partial wave is the only case with two 4-star resonances .",
    "both resonances are well determined from the @xmath70 multipoles of the maid and said analyses . only for the second state , @xmath71 ,",
    "we find a discrepancy in the strength , it appears two times as strong in the maid analysis compared to said",
    ". a third resonance state , @xmath72 , is found , but only in the maid ed solution .",
    "it shows up with a normalized strength of @xmath73 , a rather large value for a resonance only listed with @xmath74-star",
    ". it will be an important candidate to watch for in forthcoming new se analyses from complete experiment studies .",
    "+   + the @xmath31 partial wave shows a consistency only for the existence of the roper state @xmath75 .",
    "the second resonance state @xmath29 ( state with 3 pdg stars ) is more problematic .",
    "it varies considerably in our analyses .",
    "the width differs by a factor 5 while the residue strength differs even more . in the maid se solution , see fig .  3 ,",
    "a clear enhancement is seen in the imaginary part of the @xmath76 multipole , near 1700 mev . in the same region , however , the said se solution in fig .",
    "4 appears rather smooth .",
    "this is another important case to be better determined with future double - polarization experiments . at this point , it is worth noting , that this state may also be compensated by different background parameterizations which both can similarly well describe the fitted data .",
    "one possible explanation for this problem can be given within the framework of l+p expansion method .",
    "real branch points in the l+p method describe the situation when only two - body @xmath77 two - body processes contribute , while the complex branch point is a mathematical implementation of the situation when the three - body final state , containing a two - body resonant sub - channel , is also important .",
    "when only real branch points are considered , this second @xmath29 state is needed to explain the data . however ,",
    "when a complex @xmath78 branch point is used ( indicating a resonance in the @xmath79 sub - channel of a three - body final state ) , the second resonance in the @xmath9 channel is no longer needed .",
    "this will be further explored in the following subsection .",

    "<S> we have applied a new approach to determine the pole positions and residues from pion photoproduction multipoles . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on a laurent expansion of the partial wave t - matrices , with a pietarinen series representing the regular part of energy - dependent and single - energy photoproduction solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the method has been applied to multipole fits generated by the maid and gwu / said groups . we show that the number and properties of poles extracted from photoproduction data correspond very well to results from @xmath0n elastic data and values cited by particle data group ( pdg ) . </S>",
    "<S> the photoproduction residues provide new information for the electromagnetic current at the pole position , which are independent of background parameterizations , as opposed to the breit - wigner representation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present the photo - decay amplitudes from the current maid and said solutions at the pole , for all four - star nucleon resonances below @xmath1  gev . </S>"
