    "the experimental realization of trapped ultracold bosonic gases on optical lattices has opened up the possibility of observing various quantum phases ( e.g. , superfluid and mott insulator ) and studying the quantum phase transitions between them in a well - controlled manner . without the confining trap , the system will undergo a superfluid - mott - insulator phase transition at integer fillings . in the presence of a confining trap , the superfluid and mott - insulator regions may coexist@xcite due to the inhomogeneity induced by the trap .",

    "in such a system , the inter - atom interaction and the competition between the superfluidity  and mott insulator phases are expected to play a crucial role in shaping the inter - well tunnelling .    in this paper",
