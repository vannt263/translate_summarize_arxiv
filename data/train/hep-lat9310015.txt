    "the ashkin - teller ( at ) model @xcite has been studied extensively , ever since its introduction , by a variety of methods . in two dimensions , in particular ,",
    "much is known about the phase diagram and critical behavior of the model .",
    "nevertheless there are problems that were not addressed extensively before ; the critical behavior of random at models is one such issue about which not much is known , hope for analytic treatment is slim , and therefore one expects numerical simulations to be the main tool of investigation . with this aim in mind , we set out to develop an efficient monte carlo ( mc ) cluster algorithm for the at model .",
    "a convenient representation of the _ generalized _ at model ( gat ) is in terms of two ising spin variables , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , placed on every site of a lattice . denoting by @xmath5 a pair of nearest neighbor sites , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath6    \\label{eq : at1}\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are the strengths of the interactions between neighboring @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) spins , and @xmath11 is a four - spin coupling .",
    "the phase diagram of the ferromagnetic general at model is known in two dimensions from duality transformations and renormalization group studies @xcite .",
    "the three dimensional model has been studied as well @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the @xmath12 subspace of the general model , in which @xmath13 .",
    "the phase diagram in this subspace is reviewed in sec .",
    "the critical properties of the model in this subspace are of special interest , since it has a line of critical points , along which the exponents vary continuously , and have been determined analytically @xcite , interpolating between ising and four - state potts exponents .",
    "for instance , the value of the ratio @xmath1 varies from 0 at the ising ( @xmath14 ) critical point to @xmath15 at the four - state potts point @xmath16 .",
    "this exponent is of special interest to us since it has been proved that for potts models it serves as lower bound to the dynamic exponent @xmath0 of cluster algorithms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the bound seems to be reached in the case of the ising and potts models @xcite .",
    "cluster algorithms @xcite as introduced by swendsen and wang @xcite , and extended by wolff @xcite , are reviewed briefly in sec .",
    "3 . these algorithms give rise to dynamics whose relaxation time , @xmath17 , is significantly shorter than that of standard , single - spin flip mc methods .",
    "this is most important at a critical point , where the relaxation time of a finite system grows with its linear size l according to @xmath18 cluster algorithms have a significantly lower dynamic exponent @xmath19 than that of standard mc .",
    "hence if one is interested in performing extensive simulations of a model such as at , it is well worth to spend time on developing an appropriate cluster algorithm .",
    "creating an efficient algorithm can be a challenge .",
    "naive application of the original sw scheme does not work ( as explained in sec .",
    "3 and demonstrated in sec .",
    "4 ) . we set out to construct an efficient cluster algorithm using the guidelines and methods that were presented by kandel and domany @xcite .",
    "this general scheme is guaranteed to yield an algorithm that satisfies detailed balance , and once the important excitations of the model have been identified and incorporated , we are guaranteed to get a good algorithm .",
    "this general formalism is briefly reviewed , and the resulting algorithm is presented in sec .",
    "interestingly , the cluster algorithm found this way is identical to what would have been obtained had we used wolff s ising embedding method @xcite , as shown in the appendix .",
    "numerical results are given in sec .",
    "4 ; in particular , efficiency of our algorithm is tested by measuring the dynamic exponent along the critical line , which is indeed significantly lower than that of standard mc .",
    "an interesting question we set out to resolve concerns comparison of @xmath19 with @xmath1 along the at critical line .",
    "we found that the li - sokal bound @xcite @xmath20 is satisfied , variation of the dynamic exponent follows that of @xmath1 , and within our numerical accuracy and limitations due to finite size effects , our results indicate that the two are equal .",
    "we now review the phase diagram of the square lattice at model @xcite and some of its critical properties . figure [ fig : at phase ]",

    "the couplings are sufficiently strong so that @xmath9 and @xmath10 independently order in a ferromagnetic fashion so that @xmath26",
    ". in this phase @xmath27 is also different from zero and has the same sign as @xmath28 .",
    "\\(c ) a phase labeled @xmath27 , in which @xmath25 is ordered ferromagneticaly but @xmath29 .",
    "this phase arises only for @xmath30 .    on the dashed line @xmath31 we have @xmath14 ;",
    "and thus it is obviously a subspace of two decoupled ising models , having an ising transition at the point @xmath32 . the dashed line @xmath33 has @xmath34 , in which case the at model becomes the 4-state potts model .",
    "the point @xmath35 is a 4-state potts multicritical point .",
    "a marginal operator generates a continuous variation of critical exponents along the line @xmath36 , isomorphic to the known critical line of the eight - vertex model @xcite . through an exact duality type transformation",
    "this line is mapped onto the critical line of a staggered 8-vertex model and through a relation with the coulomb gas its critical exponents are known exactly @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 \\ ; ,     \\label{eq : gr}\\ ] ] and @xmath39 all along the line .",

    "it is given by the self - dual line @xmath42 .",
    "cluster algorithms have proved to be a useful method of reducing critical slowing down in mc simulations . for completeness",
    "we review here the pioneering cluster algorithm of swendsen and wang ( sw ) @xcite for the ising model@xcite with the hamiltonian @xmath43    the sw procedure stochastically identifies clusters of aligned spins , and then flips whole clusters simultaneously . starting from a given configuration @xmath44",

    "now the new configuration is generated by flipping every cluster with probability 1/2 .",
    "note that according to ( [ eq : swd1 ] ) , only spins of the same sign can be frozen in the same cluster .",
    "sw identify correctly the elementary large scale excitations as clusters of aligned spins .",
    "this correct identification is essential to the success of a cluster method for any more general model .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : naive ] we shall present a naive implementation of the original sw scheme to the at model , and explain why it is not expected to work well .",
    "this necessitates search for a different clustering rule ; the one we found is based on a general scheme which we now describe .",
    "a unifying view of all cluster algorithms has been given by kandel and domany ( kd)@xcite , which we now review .",
    "the general scheme consists of two steps : given a spin configuration @xmath44 , the first step consists of stochastically generating a new hamiltonian @xmath50 .",
    "the second step consists of simulating the model with the new hamiltonian , thereby bringing it to a new configuration @xmath51 . to carry out the first step , kd write the hamiltonian as @xmath52 for example @xmath53 can be the energy of a single bond in the nearest neighbor ising hamiltonian . then to each @xmath53",
    "they assign one of @xmath54 possible integers @xmath55 , in a stochastic manner that depends on the starting configuration @xmath44 .",
    "that is , the probability to assign @xmath55 to @xmath56 is written as @xmath57 .",
    "this probability is normalized , i.e. @xmath58 for any term @xmath56 and configuration @xmath44 .",
    "then they construct a new hamiltonian : @xmath59 where ( for any spin configuration @xmath60 ) : @xmath61+c_{i}^{l}.     \\label{eq : dbold}\\ ] ] the free parameters @xmath62 are configuration independent .",
    "the second step consists of simulation of the model with any procedure whose transition probability @xmath63 satisfies the detailed balance condition with respect to the new hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath64 after completing the second step , a new configuration @xmath51 is arrived at , the original hamiltonian is restored and the process is repeated .",
    "equations (  [ eq : dbold ] ) and (  [ eq : dbnew ] ) ensure that the whole procedure satisfies the detailed balance condition , with respect to the original hamiltonian ( for the proof see @xcite ) , but ergodicity needs to be proved for each application separately .",
    "we give now two types of modifications to the hamiltonian .",
    "consider a term @xmath65 that can take @xmath66 distinct energy values @xmath67 , @xmath68,  ,@xmath66 . the first is the deletion operation , used by sw , which eliminates the interaction @xmath69 that gets replaced by @xmath70 for any configuration @xmath60 . to get this",

    "this type of modification allows free movements between some of the states @xmath44 of @xmath65 which did nt have the same energy in the original hamiltonian , and we will use it for the ashkin teller model in section [ sec : atc ] .",
    "perhaps it can be useful in general , in cases where the @xmath53s can have more than two possible energies .",
    "this type of operation has been used for example in @xcite .",
    "a particular case of this operation is obtained if @xmath78 , and we set @xmath79 substitution into ( [ eq : gf prob ] ) yields @xmath80 and from ( [ eq : gf v ] ) , the modified interaction takes the form : @xmath81 this operation assigns infinite energy to any configuration @xmath60 for which @xmath82 .",
    "that is , in the ensuing simulation the interaction @xmath53 is frozen at energy @xmath83 .",
    "freezing of @xmath53 is assigned with probability @xmath84 , and only when @xmath85 .",

    "\\label{eq : vl}\\ ] ] since the model is invariant under any permutation of @xmath88 and @xmath11 ( to make this symmetry explicit , define a new ising spin @xmath89 along with the constraint @xmath90 ) , it is possible to choose @xmath91 ( the reason for this choice will become clear later ) .",
    "the interaction @xmath53 depends on four independent ising spins that can have 16 states .",
    "every @xmath53 can take one of four possible energy values : @xmath92 every energy is four - fold degenerate ; we denote by @xmath93 all ( four ) states for which @xmath94 .",

    "our choice @xmath91 makes @xmath100 the highest energy state , in which both ising bonds are broken .",
    "the general philosophy of our freeze - delete scheme is as follows .",
    "we wish to build clusters of @xmath9 spins and of @xmath10 spins since we know that these clusters are the basic excitations of the model .",
    "clusters of @xmath101 spins are not important because @xmath11 , the bond between them , is the weakest . in order to build clusters",

    "for example in the state @xmath98 we wish to freeze the bond between the @xmath10 spins and delete the bond between the @xmath9 spins .",
    "this consideration leads us to include in our scheme two operations .",
    "the operation which we will identify as i=2 freezes the bond between @xmath102 and @xmath103 and deletes the bond between @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( see fig . [",

    "it follows the same logic as the operation i=2 and its probability is : @xmath116 again we define the probabilities : @xmath117    the third operation we wish to perform is a freezing operation of the form defined in section [ sec : general scheme ] equations ( [ eq : freezing int.]-[eq : freezing prob ] ) . in our case it freezes the bond between @xmath104 and @xmath105 _ and _ the bond between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , so it also builds the @xmath10 and @xmath9 clusters .",

    "we ve described how we generate a new hamiltonian of non - interacting clusters of @xmath9 spins and of @xmath10 spins .",
    "now we have to choose some legitimate mc procedure to simulate this hamiltonian .",
    "we chose to do it in a similar fashion to the single cluster algorithm of wolff @xcite , but the sw version is equally applicable . to be more explicit , we choose a site @xmath46 of the lattice at random and a random spin ,",
    "either @xmath104 or @xmath102 ( the choice of @xmath9 or @xmath10 was done with probability 1/2 which is sensible in the case @xmath132 , but in general any probability is acceptable , and an optimal choice can be made to minimize the autocorrelation time @xmath10 ) .",
    "this spin will belong to the cluster we will flip , and the cluster will contain only @xmath10 ( @xmath9 ) spins if we initially chose @xmath102 ( @xmath104 ) . we perform the freeze - delete operations only on bonds belonging to the surface of the cluster .",
    "for example suppose at some stage @xmath102 was joined to the cluster , and suppose that the term @xmath133 was modified according to i=3 , then @xmath103 will not be joined to the cluster and we need not perform freeze - delete operations on the other three bonds connecting the site @xmath45 .",
    "if it is modified according to i=1 or i=2 then @xmath103 is joined to the cluster .",
    "since our cluster algorithm fits into the general scheme , we do not need to prove detailed balance , while ergodicity is ensured by the deletion operation .",
    "we ve explained the reasoning behind our algorithm .",
    "we believe that the clusters we build of parallel @xmath9 spins and of parallel @xmath10 spins are the basic excitations of the model .",
    "we therefore believe that it will be efficient .",
    "it is encouraging to notice that in the decoupled ising subspace and the 4-state potts subspace our freeze / delete scheme is identical with sw s freeze / delete operations for these models . in the appendix",

    "we find it illuminating to compare our algorithm to a cluster algorithm which one could regard as the naive generalization of the sw method to the at model .",

    "this scheme also generates clusters of @xmath9 spins and clusters of @xmath10 spins , but with the ` naive ' scheme , antiparallel ising spins can be found in the same cluster , so this scheme does not identify the elementary excitations of the model .",
    "moreover the @xmath9 clusters structure is forced to match the @xmath10 clusters ( and vice versa ) .",
    "this is totally unphysical since in practice it is energetically favorable for the two cluster structures to match ( for @xmath137 ) . at @xmath136",
    "this scheme could freeze the whole lattice into a single cluster even when it is not in the ground state .",
    "this is in contrast to the ability of our scheme to relax excitations on any scale even at @xmath136 ( in other words , at @xmath136 our algorithm will bring any initial configuration to the ground - state in a short time ) . at a finite temperature",

    "this research has been supported by the us - israel bi - national science foundation ( bsf ) .",
    "our algorithm can also be seen from a totally different point of view ; as an example of an embedding algorithm@xcite .",
    "the main idea is to embed into the at model an ising model of space dependent couplings @xmath232 and simulate it using the sw or wolff procedure for the ising model . to be explicit ,",
    "consider the hamiltonian ( [ eq : at1 ] ) , and take the @xmath10 variables as fixed , so we can write @xmath233 @xmath234 represented by the second sum is a constant , and remembering that we chose @xmath235 ,  @xmath236 is a ferromagnetic ising model in the @xmath9 variables with couplings @xmath237 . simulating this ising model with any procedure that will maintain detailed balance with respect to @xmath236 and will not change the value of @xmath234 , will also maintain detailed balance with respect to @xmath238 .",
    "so we can use for example the sw or wolff procedure for the ising model , explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : general scheme ] .",
    "this by itself will maintain detailed balance but will not be ergodic since the @xmath10 variables will not be updated . obviously to update",
    "the @xmath10 variables the same process should be repeated , holding the @xmath9 variables fixed and simulating an ising hamiltonian with the @xmath10 variables . to summarize ,",
    "a possible procedure would go as follows : choose at random whether to embed into the at hamiltonian an ising hamiltonian in the @xmath9 spins or in the @xmath10 spins . pick a random site in the lattice , grow a cluster of @xmath9 or @xmath10 spins using the wolff ( 1c ) procedure using the ising hamiltonian and flip it .",
    "as we will now show , this process ( we ll call it for shortness ie  ising embedding ) is exactly equivalent to the at algorithm ( ata ) we suggested in section [ sec : atc ] .    a first argument which is really sufficient goes as follows .",
    "suppose we perform the ie freeze - delete scheme for the @xmath9 spins for the whole lattice , viewing the @xmath10 spins as constant .",
    "we could say we ve generated a new hamiltonian of noninteracting clusters of @xmath9 spins and which assigns infinite energy to any configuration which differs from the current configuration of @xmath10 spins .",
    "now suppose we perform the ata freeze - delete scheme for the whole lattice .",
    "then we get a new hamiltonian of noninteracting clusters of @xmath9 spins and of @xmath10 spins , but if at this stage we decide to flip only @xmath9 spins , then in practice we ve assigned infinite energy to any configuration which differs from the current configuration of @xmath10 spins . in practice",
    "we flip only one cluster of the @xmath9 spins , so what we do is identical to the wolff ( 1c ) version of the ie . since both processes maintain detailed balance using the same new hamiltonian they must do so using the same probabilities ( the general scheme in sec .",
    "[ sec : general scheme ] shows a one to one correspondence between probabilities and the new hamiltonian . ) , which completes our argument that the two methods are actually identical .",
    "one can , of course , check that the probabilities of the two procedures are the same .",
    "for example , denote the probability to delete a bond between @xmath9 spins in ata as @xmath239 . for @xmath97 for example , from fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] : @xmath240 now with the ising embedding algorithm , according to ( [ eq : swd1 ] ) : @xmath241 so @xmath242 .",
