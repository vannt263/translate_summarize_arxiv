    "at a lunch with david gross , director of kitp and winner of the 2004 nobel prize , one of us ( k.f . ) asked him what his goals were for the large hadron collider , the billion dollar accelerator at cern in geneva that will start taking data this spring .",
    "his answer was , `` supersymmetry , supersymmetry , supersymmetry . ''",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) , at this point a beautiful theoretical construct , has the capability of addressing many unanswered questions in particle theory as well as providing the underpinnings of a more fundamental theory such as string theory .",
    "if susy is right , then for every known particle in the universe , there is an as yet undiscovered partner .",
    "the lightest of these , known as the lightest supersymmetric particle or lsp , would provide the dark matter in the universe .",
    "the lsp is the favorite dark matter candidate of many physicists .",
    "this is true not only because of the beautiful properties of susy , but also because the lsp automatically has the right properties to provide 24% of the energy density of the universe .",
    "in particular , the neutralino , the susy partner of the w , z , and higgs bosons , automatically has the required weak interaction cross section and @xmath1 gev - tev mass to give the correct amount of dark matter in the universe today .",
    "the susy particles are in thermal equilibrium in the early universe , and annihilate among themselves to produce the relic density today .",
    "it is this same annihilation process that is the basis of the work we consider here .",
    "the susy particles , also known as wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) , annihilate with one another wherever their density is high enough .",
    "such high densities are achieved in the early universe , in galactic haloes today @xcite , in the sun @xcite and earth @xcite , and , as we have found , also in the first stars @xcite . as our canonical values",
    ", we will use the standard value @xmath2 for the annihilation cross section and @xmath3 gev for the susy particle mass ; but will also consider a broader range of wimp masses ( 1 gev10 tev ) and cross - sections .",
    "we here describe the results of our work @xcite which considers the effect of susy dark matter annihilation on the first stars .",
    "these stars form at redshifts @xmath4 in dark matter ( dm ) haloes of @xmath5 ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one star is thought to form inside one such dm halo .",
    "we must first ask , what is the dark matter density inside a forming protostar ? to answer this question we use an adiabatically contracted nfw profile @xcite .",
    "we start with an overdense region of @xmath6 with an nfw profile for both dm and gas , where the gas contribution is 15% of that of the dm",
    ". then we use adiabatic contraction ( @xmath7 = constant ) @xcite and match onto the baryon density profiles given by @xcite to obtain dm profiles .",
    "our resultant dm profiles are shown in fig .",
    "1a for concentration parameter @xmath8 at a redshift @xmath9 and halo mass @xmath10 .",
    "it is important to point out that our results do not change much when these parameters change ; e.g. even for @xmath11 , the dark matter density only changes by a factor of 4 . after contraction ,",
    "the dm density at the outer edge of the baryonic core is roughly @xmath12 and scales as @xmath13 outside the core .",
    "our adiabatically contracted nfw profile matches the dm profile obtained numerically in  @xcite , who also found @xmath14 , for both their earliest and latest profiles .    , @xmath15 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the blue ( solid ) lines show the initial profile .",
    "black ( dot - dash ) lines correspond to a baryonic core density of @xmath16 , red ( long - dashed ) lines to @xmath17 , magenta ( dashed ) lines to @xmath18 and green ( dotted ) lines to @xmath19 . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    wimp annihilation produces energy at a rate per unit volume @xmath20 . in the early stages of pop",
    "iii star formation , when the gas density is low , most of this energy is radiated away @xcite . however , as the gas collapses and its density increases , a substantial fraction @xmath21 of the annihilation energy is deposited into the gas , heating it up at a rate @xmath22 per unit volume .",
    "we have estimated the fraction @xmath21 of dm annihilation energy that remains inside the gas core .",
    "while neutrinos escape from the cloud without depositing an appreciable amount of energy , electrons and photons can transmit energy to the core .",
    "we find that , for lsp mass @xmath3gev ( 1 gev ) , a crucial transition takes place when the gas density reaches @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . above this density ,",
    "most of the annihilation energy remains inside the core and heats it up to the point where further collapse of the core becomes difficult . to compare with dm heating",
    ", we include all relevant cooling mechanisms .",
    "the dominant mechanism is h@xmath25 cooling ; we use the rates in  @xcite .",
    "we use the opacities from @xcite ; e.g. at @xmath26 , we take a @xmath27 cooling efficiency . setting the heating rate equal to the cooling rate",
    "gives the critical temperature @xmath28 at a given density @xmath29 below which heating dominates .",
    "in figure 2 we compare @xmath28 to typical evolution tracks in the temperature - density phase plane .",
    "the blue ( solid ) and green ( dotted ) lines show the temperature evolution of the protostellar gas in the simulations ( without dm ) of @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the red ( dashed and dot - dashed ) lines show the critical temperature : below these lines , dm heating dominates over all cooling mechanisms .     for : ( i ) @xmath30 gev with h@xmath25 density from simulations ,",
    "( ii ) @xmath30 gev assuming 100% h@xmath25 , ( iii ) @xmath3 gev and ( iv ) @xmath31 tev . at the crossing point of the blue / green and red lines ,",
    "dm heating dominates over cooling in the core s evolution .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure 2 illustrates results for a range of wimp masses from 1 gev10 tev for a canonical @xmath32 annihilation cross - section . since the heating rate scales as @xmath33",
    ", these same curves equivalently apply to a variety of cross - sections for a given wimp mass .",
    "the important result is that the blue / green ( evolutionary ) and red ( critical temperature ) lines always cross , regardless of wimp mass or h@xmath25 fraction : this is a robust result .",
    "as soon as the core density reaches this crossing point , the dm heating dominates inside the core and changes its evolution . notice that at @xmath341 gev , the crossing point for small @xmath35 fraction is at low densities , around @xmath36 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath35 fraction is increased , cooling dominates for a longer time , as expected , but not forever .",
    "our results were obtained for two possible values for the h@xmath25 fraction : the value given by the simulations without dm , and the case of 100% molecular hydrogen .",
    "as soon as the dm annihilation products are contained inside the protostellar core , the heating dominates over the cooling .",
    "hence , for 100 gev ( 1 gev ) neutralino dm , once the gas density reaches a critical value of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , the heating rate from dm annihilation exceeds the rate of hydrogen cooling .",
    "the protostellar core is _ prevented from cooling and collapsing _ further .",
    "the size of the core in the standard pop iii models at this point is @xmath39 a.u .",
    "( @xmath40 a.u . ) and its mass is @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) ; we plan to compute the stellar structures of the `` dark stars '' to see what alternative size and mass result .",
    "our main conclusion is that the standard picture of pop iii star formation is drastically modified by neutralino dark matter annihilation inside the protostellar object .",
    "we propose that a new type of object is created , a `` dark star '' supported by dm annihilation rather than fusion .",
    "the question is how long such a phase of stellar evolution lasts .",
    "if such an object were stable for a long time period , it would even be possible for these dark stars to still exist today .",
    "dark stars could last as long as the dm annihilation timescale , @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "for our canonical case , we find @xmath49 myr ( @xmath50 myr ) for @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) . by comparison ,",
    "the entire timescale for collapse ( without taking into account dm annihilation ) is @xmath53 myr at @xmath54 or 100 myr at @xmath55 ; even for the more recent episodes , the dynamical time at the high densities considered here is very short ( @xmath56 yr ) .",
    "however , after this dm annihilates away , it is possible that the dm hole in the small central core can fill in again , depending on the dm orbits at this stage .",
    "dm further out can also continue to heat the core .",
    "on the other hand , as baryons continue to accrete onto the protostar , it is possible that the annihilation shuts down sooner .",
    "the lifetime of the dark star phase is crucial to addressing the question of the effects it has on the universe .",
    "the effects of such a new phase of stellar evolution could be very interesting .",
    "the reionization of the igm could be quite different , as would be the production of the heavy elements required to form all future generations of stars .",
    "dm heating may also alter the mass of pop iii stars .",
    "due to dm heating the initial mass function for pop iii stars could be modified . on the one hand",
    "the dm heating could prevent further accretion of baryons @xcite so that the resulting stars are less massive .",
    "alternatively the initial protostellar object may be larger and dark stars might accrete enough material @xcite to form large black holes @xcite en route to building the @xmath57 black holes observed at @xmath58 .    what are the observational consequences of a `` dark star '' ?",
    "dark stars are giant objects , with core radii @xmath59 au ; perhaps they could be found by lensing experiments .",
    "the dm annihilation products may be seen in detectors on earth today , e.g. neutrinos travel great distances without interacting and might be seen in e.g. amanda or icecube .",
    "it is interesting to imagine that dm could be discovered in this way . or , if it is previously discovered elsewhere , then its properties ( mass and cross - section ) could be studied .",
    "the photons resulting from the annihilation could contribute to the @xmath60-ray background and could be seen by glast or atmospheric cherenkov telescopes such as hess , veritas , and magic .",
    "alternatively , if the dm heating slows down but does not entirely hinder the pop iii collapse , the difference of the expected evolution from the more standard scenario could be seen in the next generation of telescopes such as jwst .",
    "this project would not have come into existence without the help of pierre salati .",
    "we are also particularly grateful to chris mckee for many useful conversations as well as his encouragement .",
