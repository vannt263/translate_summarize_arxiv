    "high - energy , high - precision neutrino measurements have become an important tool for measuring the parameters of the standard model and for testing our understanding of the electroweak and strong interactions .",
    "this review has presented the current status of these measurements and has pointed out some of the open questions .",
    "these topics are summarized below along with comments on future measurements , now underway or being planned , which will have even higher precision and be able to address some of these questions .",
    "precision neutrino experiments have made important contributions to our knowledge of nucleon structure and the strong interaction through the measurements of the structure functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "data have been taken over a wide range of targets and energies .",
    "the total neutrino cross section divided by energy has been found to be constant with energy , regardless of target .",
    "the structure function measurements have different assumptions concerning @xmath35 and radiative corrections , and are made on different types of target nuclei , making cross experiment comparisons difficult . iron data between ccfr and cdhsw can be directly compared and a discrepancy exists , particularly in the low-@xmath1 region and as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "neutrino scattering studies yield important determinations of the parton distribution functions .",
    "these results are important inputs to the global fits due to the unique flavor differentiation of the neutrino measurements combined with the good precision .",
    "the @xmath34 structure function is particularly important due to its close connection to the valence quark distribution .",
    "the recent neutrino measurements have comparable statistics to the charged - lepton structure function measurements .",
    "comparisons of the neutrino @xmath33 measurements to charged - lepton experiments allows an important test of the universality of the parton distributions measured in different processes .",
    "the comparison indicates general agreement over most of the kinematic region but a small discrepancy at low @xmath1 after quark charge and nuclear corrections are applied . at present , this differences is not understood .",
    "the discrepancy may be related to assumptions concerning nuclear corrections or to systematic errors in one or more of the experiments at low @xmath1 .",
    "the difference is too large to be explained by uncertainties in the strange sea which has been measured from neutrino charm production .",
    "precise tests of qcd are now possible with neutrino scattering data .",
    "the ccfr e744/e770 data is the most precise and the @xmath79 evolution of the structure functions yields @xmath80  mev .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath81 .",
    "this is the most precise measurement of @xmath82 at low and moderate @xmath30 values .",
    "the agreement of the ccfr data with the qcd expectation is quite good .",
    "the gls sum rule results have sufficient accuracy to test the predicted qcd corrections .",
    "evaluation of this sum rule yields another measurement of the strong coupling constant which is consistent with the ccfr @xmath82 result from qcd evolution .",
    "because of the inclusive nature of the gls and evolution measurements , these results have small theoretical errors and have been important in the past in establishing the qcd theory and more recently in making precise measurements of the fundamental parameters .",
    "the nutev experiment @xcite at fermilab , which uses the upgraded ccfr detector and a new sign - selected beam @xcite , began taking data in may , 1996 .",
    "this experiment will address many of the issues concerning structure functions raised in this review . among the nutev goals are more precise measurements of @xmath82 and @xmath35 . in order to investigate fully the discrepancy in the @xmath33 measurements , more data in the low-@xmath1 region with",
    "improved systematic understanding are required .",
    "the nutev experiment is expected to obtain approximately equal statistical errors on @xmath33 with substantially reduced systematics .",
    "the most important systematic uncertainties are related to the absolute energy calibration of the detector . for the nutev experiment ,",
    "precise hadron and muon energy calibrations will be obtained over a wide range of energies using precision test beam measurements throughout the run . with these improvements",
    ", the experiment should be able to measure the qcd scale parameter , @xmath83 to better than 25 mev and improve significantly the uncertainties in the @xmath33 structure function measurements at low-@xmath1 .",
    "neutrino charm production has been used to isolate the nucleon strange quark distributions , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and study the transition to the heavy charm quark .",
    "the ccfr nlo analysis agrees well with their dimuon data over a broad range of energies with a charm quark mass , @xmath87 gev . at nlo",
    ", the strange quark distribution is found to have the same shape as the non - stange sea but with a magnitude that is @xmath88 of a su(3 ) symmetric sea .",
    "these measurements imply that an increased strange sea can not be the explanation for the discrepancy between the neutrino and charged - lepton measurements of @xmath33 at low-@xmath1 .",
    "investigations by the ccfr collaboration , also , indicate that the @xmath89 and @xmath90 distributions are similar as expected from a perturbative qcd source but inconsistent with non - perturbative models of intrinsic strangeness in the nucleon .    the ckm matrix elements @xmath84 and @xmath91 are determined from the neutrino dimuon data using an effective charm semileptonic branching ratio found from @xmath92-emulsion and @xmath93 data .",
    "the combined ccfr / cdhs data yields a value of @xmath94 which is in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath95 found from other measurements combined with the unitarity of the ckm matrix . with the assumption that the strange sea must be smaller than the non - strange sea @xmath96 , @xmath91",
    "is limited by the dimuon data to be @xmath97 .",
    "the parameter @xmath98 could possibly be determined in the future from a measurement of @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "a @xmath100 measurement of @xmath98 will provide a @xmath101 measurement of @xmath102 .",
    "present and future high - energy neutrino experiments should be able to significantly improve these measurements .",
    "the nutev experiment at fermilab is running with a sign - selected beam which will eliminate the @xmath103 confusion in the dimuon channel at low @xmath1 with statistics similar to the ccfr ( e744/770 ) sample .",
    "nomad @xcite and chorus @xcite at cern are presently running with a high - energy , horn - focused beam searching for neutrino oscillations .",
    "these experiments will also record a sizeable number of charm production events ( about 20,000 dileptons for nomad and 20,000 reconstructed charm particles for chorus . ) as in the e531 experiment , chorus will be able to reconstruct exclusive channels allowing precise tests of the theory .",
    "the ultimate neutrino charm production experiment is cosmos(e803 at fermilab ) @xcite . like chorus ,",
    "the experiment is a hybrid emulsion experiment that can reconstruct exclusive charm final states .",
    "the estimated data sample is 200,000 reconstructed charm events which might allow a determination of @xmath84 to @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "wsm production has also been used to probe the charm content in the nucleon through the neutral current scattering of a @xmath32 off a charm quark which subsequently decays into a @xmath105 . from their wsm data with @xmath106 gev",
    ", the ccfr collaboration has set a @xmath107 confidence level ( cl ) upper limit on the wsm rate of @xmath108 which is much larger than the estimate of @xmath109 for nc charm scattering .",
    "the currently running nutev experiment will have a substantially reduced @xmath110 contamination in their new ssqt beam which corresponds to a @xmath111 wsm rate for @xmath106 gev .",
    "if additional cuts can be used to minimize the other backgrounds , the nutev experiment may be able to isolate a nc charm scattering signal and make the first direct estimate of the charm sea in the nucleon .",
    "experimental results on @xmath32 scattering on electrons and nucleons confirm predictions of the sm at low to moderate space - like momentum transfer , and in some cases , provides interesting limits on possible new physics beyond the sm .",
    "charm ii , and earlier experiments , have demonstrated from nc measurements with electron targets that @xmath112 couplings to neutrinos are independent of family number and that the @xmath112 couples to electrons in processes with very small space - like momentum transfer with precisely the strength specified by the sm and precision measurements at very high energy collider experiments .",
    "ccfr and charm ii  measurements of cc scattering of neutrinos from electrons demonstrate conclusively that the cc process is uniquely v - a and set tight constraints on possible exotic couplings beyond the sm .",
    "precision nc measurements with nucleon targets by cdhs , charm , and ccfr allow an independent and competitive ( @xmath113 mev ) prediction of the @xmath114-boson mass within the sm in a very different kinematic regime than direct and indirect collider determinations .",
    "the consistency of neutrino measurements with sm predictions allows limits to be placed on a variety of possible new physics parameters , especially those involving light quarks .",
    "the only way to probe for the expected new physics beyond the sm is currently through precision electroweak tests , and this situation will likely persist at least until the lhc turns on and begins taking data . because effects of new physics at low energies will be small and subtle , if they are there at all , it is desirable to perform as many cross checks as possible .",
    "neutrino - nucleon scattering experiments are perhaps the only non - collider measurements that have the required sensitivity to provide these checks . and indeed , there are prospects for further gains from two near - term efforts that should improve electroweak measurements in the neutrino sector .",
    "the nutev experiment is currently taking data with high intensity sign - selected beams that will permit the first significant exploitation of the pw relationship , which will reduce the error due to heavy flavor production by a factor of 4 - 5 .",
    "the new beam design also eliminates much of the uncertainty attributed to @xmath115 production of @xmath116 .",
    "depending in the total number of protons ultimately delivered , nutev should measure @xmath117 with an error of @xmath118 , which is equivalent to a @xmath119mass measurement of 100 - 150 mev .",
    "high sensitivity searches for @xmath120 oscillations are now underway with chorus and nomad at cern soon to be joined by cosmos and minos @xcite at fermilab .",
    "while these experiments probably will not directly measure electroweak parameters to interesting precision , they should greatly improve our understanding of neutrino induced charm production .",
    "it is possible that the error on the effective charm mass will be reduced by an order - of - magnitude or more , particularly by chorus and cosmos , which will have unique abilities to measure inclusive charm production in their emulsion targets . with the largest systematic uncertainty in @xmath121",
    "perhaps nearly eliminated , one might envision a successor to the nutev experiment running at fermilab with the higher intensity of the fermilab main injector , or possibly even a new neutrino experiment at lhc or a muon collider .",
    "we would like to thank the members of the ccfr and nutev collaborations for many valuable discussions and for making their results available for this review .",
