    "<S> by numerical solution and variational approximation of the gross - pitaevskii equation , we studied the localization of a noninteracting and weakly - interacting bose - einstein condensate in a weakly perturbed optical lattice in one and three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation achieved through a weak delocalizing expulsive or a linear potential as well as a weak localizing harmonic potential removes the periodicity of the optical lattice and leads to localization . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied some dynamics of the localized state confirming its stability . </S>"
