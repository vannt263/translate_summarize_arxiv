    "the investigation of the renormalization - group ( rg ) properties of composite operators in qcd is an important ingredient in the numerous applications of qcd in particle physics . in the present paper",
    "we shall consider some aspects of the rg properties of heavy baryonic currents in the framework of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite , in particular we consider the anomalous dimensions of the currents associated with the ground - state heavy baryons .",
    "it is well known that the heavy mass dependence of operators and matrix elements in qcd can be very well organized by employing an @xmath7-expansion provided by hqet .",
    "here we work to lowest order in the heavy mass expansion , i.e.  we treat the heavy quark fields as effective static fields . while this approximation should be a good starting point to understand the properties of heavy hadrons containing one heavy quark ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) it leads to significant simplifications in the calculation of the wilson coefficients that appear in the operator product expansion ( ope ) and in the calculation of rg coefficients such as the anomalous dimension coefficient dealt with in this paper .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of composite operators are basic ingredients in all applications of the ope method in qcd such as qcd sum rules  @xcite and related approaches . in this paper",
    "we undertake to calculate the two - loop anomalous dimensions of heavy baryon currents in the static approximation .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of the baryonic currents are one of the ingredients needed in the analysis of the correlators of two baryonic currents via their short distance expansion .",
    "the ensuing qcd sum rules allow one to compute the mass of heavy baryons and their residues in terms of basic non - perturbative qcd parameters .",
    "another important application where the anomalous dimensions enter is the determination of the universal non - perturbative baryonic isgur - wise function @xmath10  @xcite from three - point qcd sum rules .",
    "of particular importance is the calculation of the slope of the isgur - wise function at zero recoil .",
    "knowledge of the two - loop anomalous dimensions is important when one discusses the matching of hqet baryonic currents with the corresponding currents in full qcd .",
    "furthermore , the anomalous dimensions are needed for the calculation of some basic qcd matrix elements that appear in qcd sum rules , as for example the expectation value of the kinetic energy @xmath11 , the expectation value of the chromomagnetic energy @xmath12 , the spin - dependent axial current matrix element @xmath13 , the couplings of heavy baryons with pions and photons , and the magnetic and axial moments of heavy baryons .",

    "the corresponding expressions in a general frame moving with velocity four - vector @xmath33 can be obtained by the substitutions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the one - loop renormalization of these currents was considered in  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of the corresponding light baryonic currents to one - loop order was presented in  @xcite and to two - loop order in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we determine the two - loop anomalous dimensions of the heavy baryon currents .",
    "we evaluate the numerous two - loop diagrams with the help of reduce and mathematica packages written by us , which are based on the recurrence - relations in qcd and hqet presented in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the @xmath39-factor and thereby the anomalous dimension @xmath49 is of course specific to the operator which it renormalizes .",
    "thus they would carry an additional index which we suppress for the moment .",
    "the unrenormalized gauge parameter @xmath50 and the unrenormalized coupling constant @xmath51 defined in @xmath52 dimensions are related to the corresponding renormalized quantities @xmath46 and @xmath48 in four dimensions by @xmath53 one - loop @xmath36-results for the factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 have been given e.g.  in  @xcite .",

    "( [ zal ] ) and  ( [ z3 ] ) relative to that in  @xcite due to a difference in the sign convention for @xmath42 .",
    "the factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 determine two universal rg functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 which denote the anomalous dimensions of the coupling and gauge parameters , i.e. @xmath60 in perturbation theory the renormalization factor or function @xmath61 will be a double series in the renormalized coupling constant @xmath62 and in inverse powers of @xmath42 . we therefore write the double series expansion @xmath63 in contradistinction to this the anomalous dimension @xmath49 , as well as the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , are only expanded in powers of the coupling constant @xmath64 since they are finite quantities for @xmath65 .",

    "needless to say that physical matrix elements do not depend on the choice of @xmath37 .    with the availability of the full two - loop result one can check on the `` quick and easy''-prescription advanced in  @xcite to estimate the magnitude of two - loop corrections .",
    "this prescription goes by the name of `` naive non - abelianization '' .",
    "the idea is to replace @xmath86 by @xmath194 in the easily computed light - quark loop contribution .",
    "this prescription is based on the observation that the first term of the @xmath58-function is a large number and hence the dominant part of any corrections is connected with the term proportional to @xmath195 .",
    "thus one can hope to arrive at a good estimate of a non - abelian result by replacing the abelian @xmath195-function by its non - abelian counterpart .",
    "we find that this prescription gives a good estimate of the full result with an accuracy of 1530% as can easily be checked .",
    "an exception is the case @xmath190 ( and thereby @xmath29 ) where the `` naive non - abelianization '' estimate is completely off the mark .",
    "but note that in the latter case the anomalous dimension is an order of magnitude smaller than in the other cases .",
    "as mentioned before , the anomalous dimensions of the baryonic currents @xmath196 and @xmath197 are different at two loop order .",
    "however , the currents can be related to each other by finite renormalization  @xcite , @xmath198 the finite coefficients @xmath199 depend on the dirac structure @xmath1 , which occurs in the currents @xmath200 and @xmath201 in the mesonic case and baryonic case , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath199 may be determined by comparing the renormalized matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ larin ] ) or by calculating the logarithmic derivative of eq .",
    "( [ larin ] ) , @xmath202 let us introduce a factor @xmath203 through the relation @xmath204 , where the coefficient @xmath205 can be calculated from @xmath206 where @xmath207 was defined in eq .",
    "( [ betadelta ] ) . using the results for the two - loop anomalous dimensions derived before one obtains @xmath208 for completeness we have also included the dirac structures @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 in our discussion even though they do not correspond to the @xmath100-wave baryon states discussed in this paper . by calculating @xmath205 according to eq .",
    "( [ agamma ] ) one finally obtains @xmath212 note that the finite renormalization coefficients for the baryonic currents differ from those in the mesonic case discussed in  @xcite by the replacement @xmath213 .",
    "we have calculated the anomalous dimensions of static heavy baryon currents at two - loop order .",
    "the anomalous dimensions are basic ingredients in the analysis of qcd sum rules in the heavy baryon sector . in order to improve on the accuracy of the analysis of the two - point and three - point sum rules in the literature one needs to avail of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) radiative corrections to these sum rules .",
    "part of the nlo corrections are determined by the two - loop anomalous dimensions of the baryon currents which have been calculated in this paper .",
    "we hope to return to the subject of the nlo baryonic sum rule corrections in the near future .",
