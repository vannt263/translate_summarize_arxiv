    "neutrino handedness , including effects of mass captured in terms of solution of einstein - vlasov equation for massive neutrinos , see section  [ nu_mass_section ] .    for the purpose of computing the universe dynamics ,",
    "all of these effects ( excluding mass but including neutrino handedness ) can be summarized as an effective number of neutrinos , a cosmological parameter defined for relativistic neutrinos by comparing the total neutrino energy density to the energy density of a massless fermion with two degrees of freedom and standard photon reheating ratio , @xmath4 we emphasize that the cosmological effective number of neutrinos is distinct from the number of neutrino flavors , @xmath1 , though the latter certainly would impact the former should there be any doubt about the value of @xmath5 .",
    "the standard reheating ratio @xmath6 implied in eq.([n_nu_c ] ) arises from assuming that the entropy from @xmath7 annihilation flows solely into photons .",
    "@xmath8 is normalized such that in the simplified model where there are no non - thermal distortions and standard reheating holds then @xmath9 .",
    "from now on , we will refer to @xmath8 simply as @xmath0 while @xmath5 will be taken to be the standard model value of @xmath1  @xcite , and from now on will be absorbed into the neutrino degeneracy factor .    as we will show , the non - integer number of neutrino degrees of freedom @xmath0 reported experimentally  @xcite can be interpreted as an effect of neutrino freeze - out and reheating .",
    "this motivate a full reexamination of the neutrino freeze - out process employing the methods developed in the context of particle freeze - out in quark - gluon plasma hadronization  @xcite .",
    "our approach allows for us , in a model independent way , to relate the neutrino kinetic freeze - out temperature to @xmath0 .",
    "our model independent approach also allows us to derive formulas for the neutrino energy density and pressure after freeze - out as functions of both the effective number of neutrinos and the neutrino masses .",
    "these allow for a self consistent study of the combined effects that a non - integer effective number of neutrinos and nonzero neutrino masses have on cosmological observables , a problem that , as discussed in @xcite , has proven difficult to approach .",
    "the standard theory of neutrino freeze - out , based on the einstein - boltzmann equation with two body scattering and standard neutrino weak interactions @xcite , calculates a ( small ) non - thermal distortion of the neutrino distribution after freeze - out .",
    "the current state of the art computation results in a slight deviation of @xmath0 from @xmath10 due to the participation of the high energy tail of the neutrino distribution in reheating , and hence a small entropy transfer from @xmath7 into neutrinos , together with the effect of neutrino oscillations , leading to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recent results from the nine - year wmap observations , table 7 of ref.@xcite , and another independent study of bbn  @xcite favor an effective number of neutrinos at bbn of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , while the newly released planck data finds @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "there is currently a significant degree of interest in the precise value of @xmath0 , due to its impact on the spectrum of cmb fluctuations . at the current level of precision ,",
    "it is certainly possible that the above measurements by these different methods agree , and agree with the theoretical result @xmath16 .",
    "though far from definitive , these results suggest the alternate possibility that some mechanism in addition to standard two body scattering leads to a greater entropy flow into neutrinos than predicted by standard weak interactions and hence a value of @xmath17 .",
    "several scenarios for nonstandard neutrino interactions have been investigated , included neutrino electromagnetic properties @xcite and nonstandard neutrino electron coupling @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are not proposing a new mechanism for a modified neutrino freeze - out , but rather perform a model independent analysis of the impact of a delayed freeze - out on the neutrino momentum distribution  motivated by the question of what precisely the measurement of @xmath15 means for the neutrino momentum distribution .",
    "we work under the assumption that the increase in @xmath0 is due to the presence of conventional but not easily identified interactions that keep neutrinos in equilibrium with the background @xmath7 , @xmath18 plasma down to a lower temperature .",
    "in other words , we treat the kinetic freeze - out temperature , denoted by @xmath19 , as a free parameter determined by the unknown physics and perform a parametric study of the dependence of the neutrino distribution on @xmath19 .",
    "we show that a reduction in @xmath19 , by whatever mechanism , leads to an increase in @xmath0 and is capable of achieving the values seen in the planck data .",
    "there are two physical effects which combine in our analysis to yield to the end result :    1 .",
    "chemical freeze - out , @xmath20 , the temperature at which particle number changing processes such as @xmath21 effectively cease , and kinetic freeze - out , the temperature @xmath19 at which all momentum exchanging processes such as @xmath22 cease , are distinct .",
    "once the universe temperature drops below the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath20 , there are no reactions that , in a noteworthy fashion , can change the neutrino abundance and so particle number is conserved .",
    "however , the distribution remains in kinetic equilibrium , and hence exchanges momentum with @xmath7 , down until @xmath23 .",
    "our effect requires that the temperature interval @xmath24 overlaps with @xmath25 when the electron - positron mass becomes a significant scale and reheating occurs .",
    "this allows annihilation of @xmath7 to feed energy and entropy into neutrinos and reduce the photon - neutrino temperature ratio @xmath2 .",
    "as we will see , the freeze - out temperature for standard model neutrino scattering processes is on the border of this regime .",
    "that ` neutrino reheating ' leads to an increase in @xmath0 is quite well known  @xcite , as it is precisely this effect that leads to the standard value of @xmath26 .",
    "however , it is not well known that reheating of neutrinos is accompanied by an underpopulation of neutrino phase space relative to an equilibrium distribution .",
    "this underpopulation is characterized in the present context by a little - known cosmological model parameter , the neutrino fugacity @xmath27 .",
    "its significance for neutrino cosmology has been previously recognized @xcite but is not widely appreciated . on the other hand , in other physical processes that involve decoupling and freeze - out such chemical parameters are in daily use as already noted  @xcite .    since we ask how the kinetic freeze - out @xmath19 needs to be modified in order to explain a given value @xmath0 , in principle one can wonder if @xmath20 should also change .",
    "the general experience from other areas of physics is that it is much more difficult to find changes in @xmath20 beyond two body interaction processes .",
    "the reason that @xmath19 is more easily modified is the possible appearance of collective coherent scattering processes of the type neutrino - pasmon scattering which add to elastic scattering and thus alter @xmath19 but normally vanish in particle changing processes , leaving @xmath20 unchanged .",
    "therefore , in our analysis , we consider the chemical freeze - out process to be fixed by standard model weak interactions .",
    "in addition to the above motivation , even if @xmath20 were modified , its precise value is entirely immaterial to the present study as long as @xmath20 occurs before @xmath7 annihilation begins in earnest , as demonstrated in @xcite . under this assumption",
    ", we examine the effect that a nonstandard neutrino kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath19 has on the form of the cosmic neutrino distribution and effective number of neutrinos after decoupling in a model independent fashion ( i.e. treating @xmath19 as a free parameter ) .",
    "in section [ neqnu ] we discuss the general form of the non - equilibrium neutrino distribution , including the significance of the fugacity parameter . in [ eveq ]",
    "we derive the form of the free - streaming neutrino distribution using the einstein - vlasov equation . in [ stress_energy ]",
    "we compute various moments of the distribution . in section [ tnugam ]",
    "we compute the relation between neutrino fugacity , the reheating temperature ratio , and the kinetic freeze - out temperature . in section [ n_eff_section ]",
    "we discuss the impact on the effective number of neutrinos .",
    "we discuss the combined impact of neutrino mass and fugacity parameters when the temperature is on the order of the neutrino mass in section [ nu_mass_section ] .",
    "we present our conclusions and discussion in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "prior to the neutrino chemical freeze - out temperature , @xmath20 , number changing processes are significant and keep neutrinos in chemical ( and thermal ) equilibrium , implying that the distribution function of each neutrino flavor has the fermi - dirac form , obtained by maximizing entropy at fixed energy @xmath28 when @xmath24 , number changing process no longer occur rapidly enough to keep the distribution in chemical equilibrium but there is still sufficient momentum exchange to keep the distribution in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the distribution function is therefore obtained by maximizing entropy , with a fixed energy , particle number , and antiparticle number separately , implying that the distribution function function has the form @xmath29    the fugacity , @xmath30 , controls the occupancy of phase space and is necessary once @xmath31 in order to conserve particle number .",
    "the effect of @xmath32 is similar after that of chemical potential @xmath33 , except that @xmath32 is equal for particles and antiparticles , and not opposite , as noted in @xcite .",
    "this means @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) increases the density of both particles and antiparticles , rather than increasing one and decreasing the other as is common when the chemical potential is associated with conservation laws such as lepton number .",
    "similarly , @xmath36 @xmath37 decreases both .",
    "the fact that @xmath32 is not opposite for particles and antiparticles reflects the fact that both the number of particles and the number of antiparticles are conserved after chemical freeze - out , and not just their difference .",
    "the equality reflects the fact that any process that modifies the distribution would affect both particle and antiparticle distributions in the same fashion .",
    "the use of @xmath27 to account for the processes that feed into neutrinos is nearly exact in the temperature interval after chemical and before kinetic freeze - out , since scattering processes re - equilibrate the momentum distribution to this shape in order to maximize the entropy content .",
    "however , it is an approximation when the additional particle feeding occurs near kinetic freeze - out , where the energy dependence of the neutrino cross sections becomes significant , leading to an energy dependent freeze - out and therefore additional non - thermal distortions .",
    "these could be thought of as allowing @xmath27 to be momentum dependent . in the particular case investigated in  @xcite , these non - thermal distortions are small , below 5% . in this work , we will restrict our attention to the simplified model of a momentum independent @xmath27 .",
    "we begin our analysis with the simplest regime ( from the neutrino perspective ) , @xmath38 , when both number changing and momentum exchanging interactions have ceased and neutrinos begin to freely stream .",

    ".    we now specialize to collision free homogeneous isotropic cosmological solutions and therefore assume the flat frw ansatz for the spacetime metric @xmath47 we will make the simplifying assumption of a perfectly homogeneous universe . see @xcite for a review of the results and challenges associated with the study of inhomogeneities .",
    "due to homogeneity and isotropy , the neutrino distribution function depends on @xmath48 and @xmath49 only . therefore eq.([boltzmann ] ) becomes @xmath50 the general solution to eq.([veeqflr ] ) is known .",
    "for example , see  @xcite or @xcite .",
    "@xmath51 where @xmath52 is an arbitrary smooth function and @xmath53 is an arbitrary constant with units of mass .",
    "to continue the evolution beyond the freeze out time , @xmath54 , we must choose @xmath52 to match at @xmath54 the equilibrium distribution eq.([equilibrium ] ) .    with this in mind ,",
    "we let @xmath55 and @xmath56 to match eq.([kinetic_equilib ] ) at freeze - out . the fermi - dirac - einstein - vlasov ( fdev ) distribution function for neutrinos after freeze - out is then @xmath57 where @xmath58 eq.([neutrino_dist ] ) provides the distribution function that describes a gas of neutrinos that have been free streaming in an expanding universe since they froze out at @xmath59 .",
    "we will call @xmath60 in eq.([tneutrino_dist ] ) the neutrino background temperature , even though the distribution of free streaming particles has a thermal shape only for @xmath61 .",
    "this language is , however , reasonable since apart from the reheating factor of photons due to @xmath62 annihilation , which we discuss in section [ tnugam ] , @xmath60 tracks the photon background temperature .",
    "here we compute the stress energy tensor , number current , and entropy current associated with the distribution eq.([neutrino_dist ] ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the neutrino degeneracy ( not to be confused with the metric factor @xmath65 ) .",
    "we first work with the general form of @xmath41 given in eq.([general_sol ] ) and later specialize to the explicit form eq.([neutrino_dist ] ) .",
    "isotropy of the metric and of @xmath41 in momentum space implies that the off diagonal elements of the stress energy tensor and spacial components of the particle number and entropy currents vanish and that the pressure is isotropic .",
    "hence we must compute @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the euclidean norm of the spacial components of @xmath68 and @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 computing @xmath71 we find @xmath72 where we made a change of variables @xmath73 . note that @xmath74 is the physically measured momentum .",
    "similarly @xmath75    we now rename @xmath74 to @xmath76 , so that @xmath76 represents the magnitude of the physical momentum , drop the superscripts , and insert eq.([k_func ] ) for @xmath52 , giving the energy density , pressure , and number density for each neutrino flavor @xmath77 p&=\\frac{g_\\nu}{6\\pi^2}\\!\\int_0^\\infty\\!\\!\\!\\frac{\\left(m_\\nu^2+p^2\\right)^{-1/2}p^4dp } { \\upsilon_\\nu^{-1 } e^{\\sqrt{p^2/t_\\nu^2+m_\\nu^2/t_k^2}}+ 1},\\label{neutrino_p}\\\\[0.2 cm ] n&=\\frac{g_\\nu}{2\\pi^2}\\!\\int_0^\\infty\\!\\!\\!\\frac{p^2dp } { \\upsilon_\\nu^{-1}e^{\\sqrt{p^2/t_\\nu^2+m_\\nu^2/t_k^2}}+ 1}. \\label{num_density}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these differ from the corresponding expressions for an equilibrium distribution in minkowski space by the replacement @xmath78 _ only _ in the exponential .    by making a change of variables",
    "@xmath79 , one sees that both @xmath80 and @xmath81 are proportional to @xmath82 . by definition",
    ", @xmath60 is inversely proportional to @xmath83 , hence @xmath84 this proves that the particle number and entropy in a comoving volume are conserved .",
    "we emphasize that this result does not depend on the particular form of @xmath52 that defines the shape of the momentum distribution at freeze - out .",
    "note further that since an ev scale or below neutrino mass is at least 6 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath19 , we can ignore the neutrino mass in the exponent .",
    "this remark does not extend to the energy factor multiplying the fd - distribution in the calculation of energy density or pressure and therefore eq.([neutrino_rho ] ) and eq.([neutrino_p ] ) have unusual properties , while eq.([num_density ] ) is just what one may naively expect , remembering that the mass term in this expression is completely negligible .",
    "to complete our characterization of the neutrino distribution as it would have evolved from decoupling until recombination , we must understand the relation between the the kinetic freeze - out temperature , photon to neutrino temperature ratio , and the fugacity . to that end",
    ", we now focus on the regime between chemical and kinetic freeze - out , @xmath24 .    before the reheating period ,",
    "neutrinos , photons , electrons , and positrons have the same temperature .",
    "when the temperature approaches and drops below the electron mass , the electrons and positrons annihilate .",
    "after photon reheating , both the neutrino and photon temperatures evolve inversely proportional to @xmath83 , so their ratio after reheating equals their ratio today .",
    "the resulting ratio of photon to neutrino temperatures has often been studied , but not the type of model independent study of the @xmath19 parameter space that we present here . in the following we use subscripts @xmath45 and @xmath85 to denote quantities before and after reheating , respectively .",
    "we first outline the physics of the situation qualitatively . for @xmath24 , the evolution of the temperature of the common @xmath86 plasma and the neutrino fugacity",
    "are determined by conservation of comoving neutrino number ( since @xmath31 ) and conservation of entropy .",
    "the latter condition is not exactly correct once one drops the assumption of an instantaneous chemical freeze - out , but it is a very good approximation as shown in @xcite .",
    "as shown in section [ neqnu ] , after thermal freeze - out the neutrinos begin to free - stream and therefore @xmath27 is constant , the neutrino temperature evolves as @xmath87 , and the comoving neutrino entropy and neutrino number are exactly conserved eq.([const_entropy ] ) .",
    "the photon temperature then evolves to conserve the comoving entropy in photons , electrons , and positrons .",
    "as annihilation occurs , entropy from @xmath62 is fed into photons , leading to reheating .",
    "we now make this analysis quantitative in order to derive a relation between the reheating temperature ratio and neutrino fugacity .",
    "when the ( common ) temperature @xmath88 is much larger than the electron mass and @xmath19 , the entropy in a given comoving volume , @xmath89 , is the sum of relativistic neutrinos ( with @xmath90 ) , electrons , positrons , and photons @xmath91 where @xmath88 is the common neutrino , @xmath62 , and @xmath18 temperature .",

    "this leads to the following expressions for neutrino entropy and number at @xmath23 in the comoving volume @xmath96    after neutrino kinetic freeze - out and when @xmath97 , i.e. after reheating has completed and almost all of the @xmath62 have annihilated , the entropy in neutrinos is conserved independently of the other particle species , the electron entropy is negligible , and the photon entropy is @xmath98 note that we must now distinguish between the neutrino and photon temperatures .",
    "+ conservation arguments give the following three relations .",
    "1 .   conservation of comoving neutrino number : @xmath99 2 .",

    "conservation of @xmath7 , @xmath18 entropy after neutrino freeze - out ( at this point , neutrino entropy is conserved independently ) : @xmath101    these relations allow us to solve for the fugacity , reheating ratio , and effective number of neutrinos in terms of the freeze - out temperature , irrespective of the details of the dynamics that leads to a particular freeze - out temperature .",
    "for @xmath102 the universe is radiation dominated and @xmath103 .",
    "therefore we can normalize the scale factor so that @xmath104 as @xmath105 . with this normalization , eq.([eq_1 ] ) and eq.([eq_2 ] ) become two equations that can be solved numerically for @xmath106 , shown in figure [ fig : upsilon_q ] , and @xmath107 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath108 is an unavoidable consequence of the freeze - out process , whenever the interval @xmath24 contains temperatures on the order of the electron mass .",
    "this latter condition is critical . if freeze - out occurs while @xmath7 are still effectively massless then , after setting @xmath109 in eq.([eq_2 ] )",

    "a mass scale that becomes relevant at a particular temperature causes @xmath116 to drop below unity , towards the matter dominated value @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath118 is therefore an indicator that conditions are right for @xmath3 to be pushed off of its equilibrium value of unity if in addition we have @xmath24 , per our discussion above .",
    "a similar plot was obtained in ref.@xcite for a more detailed model of a smooth ( i.e. not instantaneous ) chemical freeze - out , where we showed that the instantaneous freeze - out approximation has error of less than @xmath119 .",

    "thus the quantities of interest are @xmath163 from eq.([rho ] ) and eq.([rho0 ] ) and the corresponding expressions for the pressure , both as functions of @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "again , we emphasize that here @xmath0 refers to the value of the effective number of neutrinos that was established at neutrino freeze - out when neutrinos were still effectively massless . at the temperatures we are now considering ,",
    "eq.([n_nu_c ] ) no longer applies .",
    "the functional dependence of the energy density and pressure that we find is best characterized by a simple polynomial representation that arises from a least squares fit : @xmath172 for a single massive neutrino , these fits are valid to within @xmath137 and @xmath173 relative error respectively in the region @xmath174 , @xmath175 .",
    "note that the upper limit is sufficient to cover the era of electron - ion recombination at @xmath176 ev and neutrino masses less than the upper bound @xmath177 ev reported in @xcite .",
    "for small mass to temperature ratios , the fit depends only on the sum of neutrino masses squared , @xmath178",
    ". however , the fourth order term is not negligible over the chosen fitting region . removing that term results in a maximum relative error between the fit and the exact result of greater than @xmath179 .",
    "this indicates that one maybe able to use a fit to cosmic data to constrain the hierarchy structure of the neutrino mass spectrum using the fitted values of @xmath180 and @xmath181 .    the formulas in eq.([rho_p_fits ] ) , or the more precise quantities eq.([rho ] ) and eq.([upsilon_ratio ] )",
    "that we fit in order to obtain them , should be used when exploring the combined effects of @xmath182 and neutrino mass on cosmological observables as they properly capture the interplay between neutrino mass and the shape of the neutrino distribution in terms of physical observables . in particular",
    ", they can be used to extract fits to @xmath183 and @xmath184 while separating off the effects of the confounding variable @xmath0 .",
    "similarly we find the net number of neutrinos after freeze - out as function of the effective number of neutrinos @xmath0 .",
    "using eq.([num_density ] ) , eq.([upsilon_ratio ] ) , and eq.([n_nu_approx ] ) to taylor expand the neutrino number density as a function of @xmath185 we find @xmath186 in the present day universe , at @xmath187 mev , we show both the exact and linearized results in figure [ fig : neutrino_density ] .",
    "we note that at @xmath188 we find @xmath189 @xmath190 per flavor , in close agreement with @xcite .    ,",
    "both exact ( solid ) and linearized ( dashed ) . the photon density ( dot - dashed )",
    "is also shown as a reference.,height=234 ]",
    "the cosmic neutrino momentum distribution is a critical input into our understanding of the spectrum of cmb fluctuations and arguably its understanding is a prerequisite for the consideration of cosmic neutrino detection opportunities . motivated by hints of a tension between the planck results and the standard theory of neutrino freeze - out expressed by a noticeably non - integer value of the effective number of neutrinos @xmath0 , we have undertaken a model independent study of the effect of a delayed kinetic freeze - out on @xmath0 , and more generally on the form of the neutrino momentum distribution .",
    "the search for reaction mechanisms that can produce a reduction in the neutrino freeze - out temperature @xmath19 from a value near @xmath191 to a value perhaps as small as @xmath192 , see figure [ fig : n_eff ] , is a topic for future investigation .",
    "possible participation of neutrinos in @xmath7 annihilation reheating and hence a ratio of photon to neutrino temperature that is closer to one , and thus @xmath193 is a well known fact  @xcite .",
    "however , less appreciated is the impact of neutrino reheating on neutrino fugacity @xmath27 , the factor describing the the neutrino distribution compared to chemical equilibrium @xmath90 .    we have shown how an increase in @xmath0 is naturally interpreted to be due to a delayed neutrino kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath19 .",
    "we derived an approximate power law relation , eq.([upsilon_ratio ] ) , between the fugacity factor and the photon to neutrino temperature ratio that arises from a delayed freeze - out .",
    "we found a fugacity @xmath27 less than unity , and thus an underpopulation of phase space compared to chemical equilibrium .",
    "after freeze - out , neutrinos freely stream through the expanding universe .",
    "the non - thermal modification from the fugacity factor is frozen into the shape of the distribution .",
    "we derived how this modified neutrino distribution evolves as the universe expands and explored how the energy density and pressure are modified , including in this study the interplay of fugacity and neutrino mass .",
    "we note that these effects impact the cosmological study of the question of neutrino mass hierarchy : the effects we present in eq.([rho_p_fits ] ) and eq.([tau_ups ] ) produce a functional dependence on both @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the fits eq.([rho_p_fits ] ) and eq.([tau_ups ] ) of the exact , but intractable eq.([rho ] ) and eq.([pev ] ) show how the energy density and pressure are self consistently modified when both neutrino mass and a non - integer @xmath0 are present .",
    "the latter dependence is expressed by using @xmath196 and @xmath197 in eq.([rho ] ) and eq.([pev ] ) as discussed in section [ nu_mass_section ] .",
    "this polynomial presentation of the cosmic neutrino energy density and pressure resolves an old problem of cosmic neutrino physics by allowing a physically consistent treatment of the combined effects of neutrino mass and @xmath185 as long as the magnitude of @xmath185 follows from neutrino freeze - out dynamics .",
