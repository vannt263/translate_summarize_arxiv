    "the rebirth of resultants , especially through the * toric*- , @xmath3- , and newton . ] resultant @xcite , has begun to provide a much needed alternative to grbner basis methods for solving polynomial systems .",
    "continuing this philosophy , we will use toric geometry to derive significant speed - ups and extensions of resultant - based methods for solving polynomial systems with infinitely many roots .",
    "the importance of dealing with degenerate polynomial systems has been observed in earlier work on quantifier elimination over algebraically closed fields @xcite : many reasonable algorithms for polynomial system solving fail catastrophically when presented with a system @xmath0 ( of @xmath1 polynomials in @xmath1 unknowns ) having a positive - dimensional zero set @xmath2 .",
    "even worse , this kind of failure can also occur when @xmath0 has only finitely many roots , if @xmath0 has infinitely many roots `` at infinity . ''",
    "when such failures occur , it is of considerable benefit to the user to at least be given some sort of description of the zero - dimensional part of @xmath2 .",
    "we will present two new techniques for handling such degeneracies .",
    "the * twisted chow form * ( cf .",
    "main theorem [ main : chow ] ) allows one to quickly coordinatize many ( but not all ) degenerate @xmath2 , simply by injecting some extra combinatorics into the classical @xmath4-resultant .",

    "main theorem [ main : pert ] ) refines and generalizes an earlier algebraic perturbation trick used by chistov and grigoriev @xcite , renegar @xcite , and canny @xcite .",
    "our refinement takes sparsity into account and allows one to replace the polynomial degrees present in earlier complexity bounds by more intrinsic geometric parameters ( cf .",
    "main theorems [ main : big ] and [ main : pert ] ) .",
    "we will see in sections [ sub : dense ] and [ sec : complex ] that our bounds are a definite improvement , sometimes even by a factor exponential in @xmath1 .",
    "our framework also allows us to work over any algebraically closed field ( as opposed to some earlier restrictions to the complex numbers ) and to isolate the zero - dimensional part of @xmath2 .",
    "we also derive four corollaries which may be of independent interest :    1 .   an explicit method to compute field extensions involving the roots of @xmath0 ( corollary [ cor : galois ] ) .",
    "2 .   an explicit formula for the exact , as opposed to generic , number of isolated . ]",
    "roots of @xmath0 ( corollaries [ cor : count ] and [ cor : double ] ) .",
    "3 .   a combinatorial construction , within polynomial time for fixed @xmath1 , of explicit @xmath0 with specified monomial term structure and no roots `` at infinity '' ( main theorem [ main : fill ] ) .",
    "4 .   a lower bound ( conjecturally an explicit formula ) for the intersection multiplicity of the positive - dimensional part of @xmath2 ( corollary [ cor : double ] ) .",
    "our main results are stated precisely in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we then give several simple examples of our main results in section [ sec : ex ] .",
    "there we also give an intuitive discussion of roots `` at infinity '' and show how our results include canny s earlier * generalized characteristic polynomial ( gcp ) * as a special case . section [ sec :",

    "our main results are then proved in section [ sec : chowtor ] , and we discuss the computational complexity of our techniques in section [ sec : complex ] .",

    "we emphasize that the main advantage of @xmath154 is that we can pick * any * @xmath143 we prefer and still get a useful analogue of @xmath120 . for instance , even if the @xmath4-resultant unluckily vanishes identically , we can always simply set @xmath110 and directly read off the coordinates of the isolated roots of @xmath0 from the factors of @xmath170 ( assuming one can do multivariate factoring over @xmath37 ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath178 and assertion ( 3 ) are central to our explicit construction of points in every irreducible component of @xmath2 , not to mention the proof of main theorem [ main : big ] .",

    "furthermore , by main theorem 1 ( and the fact that @xmath256 ) , we can at last recover a set of points lying in @xmath2 ( including all the isolated roots of @xmath0 in @xmath257 ) by substituting @xmath258 into the pair @xmath259 .",

    "let us now examine @xmath152 itself in detail : factoring with maple , we obtain that @xmath152 splits as follows : @xmath278 in particular , given any factor above , the ratio of the coefficients of @xmath112 and @xmath111 is precisely the @xmath44 coordinate of some corresponding root of @xmath0 .",

    "however , since the constant term of @xmath279 vanishes , assertions ( 1 ) of main theorems [ main : chow ] and [ main : pert ] at least tell us that @xmath2 is indeed positive - dimensional .    to distinguish the isolated roots ,",
    "let us employ an algorithm from the proof of corollary [ cor : double ] : apply main theorem [ main : fill ] once more to pick @xmath280 .",

    "we also point out that while it is customary to consider the roots of @xmath0 in @xmath147 ( as in @xcite ) , the construction of @xmath120 and @xmath154 necessitate the consideration of roots in @xmath132 as well .    to define our next example , set @xmath297 , @xmath298 , and consider the @xmath299 system @xmath300 .",

    "more to the point , @xmath314 for this specialization of the coefficients of @xmath0 .",
    "a simple geometric explanation for this behavior of @xmath315 is that the choice of @xmath143 defines a toric variety @xmath316 into which the roots of @xmath0 in @xmath132 are projected .",
    "( the variety @xmath316 is the toric variety corresponding to a * point set * @xcite , and is simply the image of @xmath132 under the morphism @xmath317 . )",
    "so depending on our choice of @xmath143 , the roots of @xmath0 in @xmath147 may or may not correspond to roots of @xmath0 in @xmath316 in a well - defined way .",
    "for instance , in our example , @xmath0 actually has * infinitely * many roots in @xmath316 , so main theorem [ main : chow ] tells us that @xmath120 * must * vanish .",
    "so it more useful to work within @xmath132 , since the roots of @xmath0 in @xmath147 and @xmath316 are actually images of the roots of @xmath0 in @xmath132 .",
    "in particular , the underlying algebraic maps induce projections of certain faces of @xmath318 ( corresponding to certain parts of @xmath319 ) onto certain faces of @xmath320 and @xmath321 .",
    "figure 2 below illustrates this , along with where the root @xmath313\\!\\in\\!{\\mathcal{t}}(p)$ ] of @xmath0 `` goes '' within these various compacta .",
    "for instance , note that @xmath318 is a cuboctahedron , and @xmath48 is constant on the portions of @xmath319 corresponding to the triangular faces with inner normals @xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 , and @xmath325 .",
    "algebraically , we have the following maps :    ( 140,60)(-150,-5 ) ( 55,40)@xmath132 ( 57,42 )    -135    @xmath326    ( 38,28 )    @xmath327    ( 74,33 )    -45    @xmath326    ( 88,28 )    @xmath328    ( -17,0)@xmath329 ( 39,0 )    @xmath330    ( 100,0)@xmath331 ( 62,-4 )    @xmath332    where @xmath327 is the natural projection between compatible toric compacta ( cf .  section [ sec : chowtor ] ) , and @xmath332 is the rational map ( defined just on @xmath67 ) from @xmath147 to @xmath316 obtained from @xmath333 $ ] . in the case at hand , the latter map is simply the identity map between the two corresponding naturally embedded copies of @xmath213 .    to remedy the preceding trivial @xmath120",

    "it is then easily verified that the system @xmath348 ( with support contained in @xmath52 ) has only finitely many roots in @xmath147 .",
    "indeed , in this case , @xmath349 and there is exactly one root ( of multiplicity @xmath350 ) at the origin @xmath351 .",

    "the last equality follows from macaulay s 19@xmath357 century construction of the multivariate resultant @xcite .",
    "so in the dense case , our complexity bound from main theorem 1 thus specializes to the best bounds from @xcite , once @xmath90 and randomization is allowed ( cf .",
    "corollary [ cor : fast ] of section [ sec : complex ] ) .    letting @xmath358",
    ", we then see that our polynomial @xmath151 is simply the original gcp @xcite , but extended to a general algebraically closed field .",
    "in particular , our @xmath359 is the polynomial system @xmath360 .",
    "( note also that if we set @xmath361 then we recover the usual characteristic polynomial of a matrix ) .",
    "finally , note that @xmath362 and the map @xmath48 is the identity .",
    "so by considering the zero set of @xmath0 in @xmath132 , in this `` dense '' case , we are just considering the zero set of @xmath0 in @xmath56 in the usual way via homogenizations .",
    "thus by main theorem [ main : pert ] , canny s original gcp indeed finds a point in every irreducible component of @xmath2 in @xmath56 , as conjectured in 1990 .",
    "of course , the advantage of the toric gcp is that we can do the same with greater efficiency for sparse systems with small @xmath60 .",

    "@xcite , one can recover the exact value of @xmath98 after interpolating @xmath654 through several - many specializations of the coefficients of @xmath461 .",
    "one such fundamental technique , which uses @xmath307 versions of @xmath224 , is known as the * division method * @xcite . in general , the matrix @xmath224 is highly structured ( it is quasi - toeplitz @xcite ) and , when @xmath90 , this permits @xmath98 to be computed much faster than would be expected . in practice",
    ", the cost of building @xmath224 ( or several versions thereof ) can be amortized when one works with many @xmath461 with support contained in the same @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , when randomization is allowed , the results of @xcite tell us that this preprocessing is actually negligible .    as for the complexity of computing @xmath98 itself , we state the following additional facts :    1 .",
    "* the gcd method ) when @xmath90 , we can compute @xmath98 ( for any choice of constant coefficients in @xmath37 for @xmath461 ) within @xmath658 arithmetic steps and @xmath659 space .",
    "is due to a use of effective hilbert irreducibility , which actually fails in positive characteristic @xcite . ] .",
    "however , we have the added benefit that we can also compute @xmath151 ( for any * constant * @xmath660 ) within the * same * complexity bound .",
    "2 .   @xcite if we assume @xmath90 * and * allow randomization , then we can accelerate the division method ( resp .",
    "gcd method ) to obtain a las vegas time bound of @xmath661 ( resp .",
    "@xmath662 ) .",
    "furthermore , either of these improvements requires only @xmath663 space .",
    "if @xmath664 , then we can reduce the deterministic time bounds of the division and gcd methods to @xmath665 , regardless of @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , if we also allow randomization and assume @xmath90 , then we can further improve the time bounds of ( i ) and ( ii ) to @xmath666 .",
    "however , characterizing when @xmath98 can be expressed as a `` small '' determinant is an open problem .",
    "( see @xcite for some interesting partial results , including some cases where the newton polytopes are products of scaled standard simplices . )",
    "the last fact is actually a simple corollary of the development of @xcite . in particular , in the situation of ( iii ) , we can skip an interpolation procedure that would have multiplied our time bound by @xmath667 .",
    "let us now state and prove the best current speed - ups for all our preceding algorithmic results .",
    "[ cor : fast ] suppose @xmath90 and we allow randomization in our algorithms .",
    "then our main algorithmic results can be sped up as follows :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     furthermore , the space bound for each of the above algorithms is @xmath663 . finally , if we also have that @xmath664 , then the four pairs of entries in the right - hand column ( from top to bottom ) can be replaced by the following sequence : @xmath668 , @xmath669 , @xmath670 , @xmath671 .",
    "@xmath399    as before , the probability of failure in our las vegas algorithm above is @xmath565 , assuming any probability distribution on the coefficients of @xmath0 yielding probability @xmath156 avoidance of algebraic hypersurfaces in @xmath155 .",
    "the total number of random choices of elements in @xmath68 ( or a small algebraic extension thereof ) needed is @xmath672 .",
    "( this is just the number choices needed to construct @xmath58 and a variant @xcite of @xmath224 . )",
    "so in summary , we can solve * any * @xmath20 system , over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero , in las vegas time near - quartic in the number of roots of a closely related system .",
    "furthermore , we can go even faster when we have a sufficiently compressed toric resultant matrix .",
    "before proving the above corollary , we will briefly explain what we mean by a `` closely related system . ''",
    "first recall that @xmath60 is precisely the cycle class degree of the toric divisor @xmath457 @xcite .",
    "put more simply , if we simply perturb the coefficients of @xmath0 , we can expect @xmath0 to have exactly @xmath60 roots in @xmath147 .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath673 defined earlier can be reinterpreted as follows : it is the average number of roots of an @xmath20 system of equations with support contained in @xmath33 , as we let the @xmath674 independently range over @xmath675 , and we assume * generically chosen * coefficients .",
    "so the quantity @xmath36 can also be interpreted as a weighted average of a set of cycle class degrees .",
    "similarly , note that the generic number of roots of the @xmath676 system @xmath677 is exactly @xmath678 .",
    "so by the multilinearity of the mixed volume , the last mixed volume is exactly @xmath645 .",
    "let us now prove our above corollary .",
    "* proof of corollary [ cor : fast ] : * the key bounds to begin with are those of corollary [ cor : count ] . in particular , the first bound of corollary [ cor : count ] is the complexity of determining whether @xmath108 vanishes identically .",
    "since this can be accomplished by evaluating @xmath98 at @xmath679 random points , facts ( i)(iii ) above immediately imply our asserted bounds .    as for the second bound of corollary [ cor : count ] , this is the complexity of running a variant of the algorithm of main theorem 1 , where @xmath154 is replaced by @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath120 is just a specialized resulant , and since this algorithm boils down to evaluating @xmath120 at @xmath680 distinct points , facts ( i)(iii ) immediately imply these bounds as well .    from the proof of main theorem 4 , we know that the bound from main theorem 4 is simply the complexity of evaluating @xmath98 at @xmath681 different specializations of @xmath39 .",
    "( remember that @xmath39 occurs only in the coefficients of @xmath682 , and all other parameters are assumed to be constants . )",
    "so this bound follows easily from facts ( i)(iii ) as well .",
    "to conclude , the bound from main theorem 1 is simply the complexity of evaluating @xmath154 at @xmath680 distinct points . from the bound of main theorem 4 ,",
    "we are done .",
    "@xmath399    are the above complexity bounds the best one can expect for solving polynomial systems specified in the sparse encoding ? neglecting the precise values of the exponents ( which we ve seen range somewhere between @xmath683 and @xmath684 , if not better ) , the answer is `` yes . '' this is due to the fact that a generic @xmath0 will have exactly @xmath60 distinct roots in @xmath37 , * regardless * of the number of terms present .",
    "thus , it is really @xmath60 , * not * the number of terms , which governs the complexity of * global * polynomial system solving over an algebraically closed field",
    ". so the quantities in the `` base '' of our bounds can not be any smaller ( asymptotically ) than @xmath60 .",
    "as for the exponent , we so far have only the obvious worst case lower bound of @xmath156 .",
    "however , the question of whether the number of terms more strongly governs the complexity of solving over a * non*-algebraically closed field , or solving for a * single * root , is quite open for @xmath685 .",
    "for example , while khovanskii has shown that the number of * real * roots of a sparse system of equations is singly exponential in the number of terms @xcite , the complexity of real solving is * not * yet known to fall within such a bound if @xmath685 . similarly , while a recent algorithm of ye @xcite for @xmath578-approximating a * single * @xmath686 root of @xmath687 has complexity @xmath688 , the complexity of finding a * single * root of @xmath0 in @xmath77 is quite open .",
    "we hope to address these finer points of sparse algebraic complexity in future work .",
    "we now close with a brief example of how @xmath60 can be smaller than @xmath87 ( the product of the total degrees of @xmath682 ) by an exponential factor .",
    "* ( well directed spikes ) * [ ex : spike ] consider the system of equations @xmath0 defined by @xmath689 @xmath690 @xmath691 in this case , the newton polytopes are all equal to a single `` spike , '' and this spike is equivalent ( via an integer linear map with determinant @xmath156 ) to a standard @xmath1-simplex scaled by @xmath200 in the @xmath193-direction .",
    "so it is easy to check that @xmath692 .",
    "however , the product of the total degrees of @xmath0 is clearly @xmath693 .",
    "( it is also not hard to see that the best * multigraded * bzout bound @xcite is @xmath694 . )",
    "generating infinite families of such examples is easy , simply by picking newton polytopes which are @xmath1-dimensional , but `` long '' in a suitable fixed direction .",
    "the construction of toric resultant matrices is an area of active research and it can be reasonably expected that our earlier asymptotic estimate on @xmath36 will be significantly improved in the near future . in particular , a significant first step would be to find an algorithm which always constructs a toric resultant matrix of size @xmath695 .",
    "looking even further ahead , there is also hope for general algorithms which construct even smaller matrices , via the use of entries which are nonlinear polynomials in the coefficients of @xmath461 .",
