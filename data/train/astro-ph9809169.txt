    "the corrections needed to account for dust extinction in high  redshift galaxies are rather uncertain , and might induce an upward revision of the star formation rates ( sfr ) deduced from uv / visible observations by factors of a few ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , star formation might be completely hidden in heavily  extinguished galaxies which are missed at optical wavelengths .",
    "the discovery of the cosmic infrared background in the firas residuals between 200 @xmath0 m and 2 mm ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) and in the dirbe residuals at 240 and 140 @xmath0 m ( @xcite ) is a strong evidence that a significant fraction of star formation is hidden in dust shrouds .",
    "the level of the cirb is more than five times higher than the `` no  evolution '' prediction based on the iras luminosity function , and twice as much as the level of the cosmic optical background deduced from converging faint galaxy counts .",
    "recent observations at 850 @xmath0 m with the scuba instrument of the jcmt ( @xcite @xcite ) have unveiled a large population of dusty objects . at the other end of the submm range ,",
    "the firback program with isophot aboard iso has yielded a catalogue of several hundred sources at 175 @xmath0 m ( @xcite ) .",
    "the number counts are much higher than the `` no  evolution '' predictions .",
    "preliminary attempts for identification seem to show that many of these objects are likely to be at @xmath1 .",
    "we hereafter briefly describe a new modelling of galaxy formation ( @xcite @xcite ) , and show predictions for on  going and forthcoming ir / submm surveys .",
    "the ir / submm spectra of galaxies are computed in the following way : ( 1 ) follow chemical evolution of the gas ; ( 2 ) implement extinction curves which depend on metallicity as in the milky way , the lmc and smc ; ( 3 ) compute @xmath2 ; ( 4 ) assume the so  called `` slab '' geometry where the star and dust components are homogeneously mixed with equal height scales .",
    "( 5 ) compute a spectral energy distribution by assuming a mix of various dust components .",
    "the contributions are fixed in order to reproduce the observational correlation of iras colours with total ir luminosity .",
    "these ir / submm spectra are implemented in a semi  analytic model of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this type of model has been very effective in computing the optical properties of galaxies in the paradigm of hierarchical clustering .",
    "we only extend this approach to the ir / submm range , and take the standard cdm case with @xmath3=50 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we assume a star formation rate @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "the efficiency parameter @xmath9 gives a nice fit of local spirals .",
    "the robust result of this type of modelling is a rather flat cosmic star formation rate history . as a phenomenological way of reproducing the steep rise of the cosmic sfr history from @xmath10 to @xmath11",
    ", we introduce a `` burst '' mode of star formation with ten times higher efficiencies .",
    "this fairly reproduces the cosmic luminosity densities , as well as the cirb .",
    "1 gives the predictions of number counts at 15 , 60 , 175 and 850 @xmath0 m for the scenario which gives the best fit of the cirb .",
    "the agreement of the predictions with the data seems good enough to suggest that these counts do probe the evolving population contributing to the cirb .",
    "the model shows that 15 % and 60 % of the cirb respectively at 175 @xmath0 m and 850 @xmath0 m are built up by objects brighter than the current limits of isophot and scuba deep fields .",
    "the predicted median redshift of the iso  hdf is @xmath12 .",
    "it increases to @xmath13 for the deep isophot surveys , and to @xmath14 for scuba , even if the latter value seems to be very sensitive to the details of evolution .",
    "2 gives a model spectral energy distribution typical of the @xmath15 @xmath16 galaxy ( similar to arp 220 ) at various redshifts .",
    "the reader should note the specific behaviour of the observed flux at submm wavelengths , where the shift of the 60  100 @xmath0 m rest  frame emission bump counterbalances distance dimming .",
    "the instrumental sensitivities of various on  going and forthcoming experiments are plotted on this diagram : the iras _ very faint source survey _ , isocam , isophot , the iram interferometer , scuba , wire , sirtf , sofia , the planck _ high frequency instrument _ , the first _ spectral and photometric imaging receiver _ , and the mma / lsa .",
    "the final sensitivity of these instruments is going to be confusion limited .",
    "table 1 gives the expected numbers of galaxies for the all  sky shallow survey of planck _ hfi _ , and the medium  deep survey of first _",
    "( to be launched by esa in 2007 ) , obtained from the model that fits the current counts .",
    "faint counts produced by these two instruments are complementary .",
    "the study of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 colours are suited to point out sources which are likely to be at high redshifts .",
    "these sources can be eventually followed at 100 and 170 @xmath0 m by the first _ photoconductor array camera & spectrometer _ and by the fts mode of _ spire _ , to get the spectral energy distribution at @xmath19 @xmath0 m with a typical resolution @xmath20 .",
