    "the combined stellar wind and supernova ejecta of groups of o and b stars blow large bubbles in the interstellar medium .",
    "the largest of these bubbles , with size scales of 100 pc to 1 kpc are commonly referred to as superbubbles .",
    "the basic structure of a superbubble consists of a hot low - density interior , the cavity , surrounded by a cool shell of swept - up interstellar medium .",
    "the continuous formation and dissipation of superbubbles is an important factor in the energy balance of the interstellar medium , and determines the locations of different phases of the interstellar medium on large scales @xcite .",
    "compression of the interstellar medium in the shell may increase cooling and trigger the formation of a new generation of stars . also , the ability of large superbubbles to break out of the disk of a galaxy and initiate an outflow of chemically enriched plasma and ionizing radiation from the disk into the halo has a profound influence on the evolution of galaxies .",
    "several examples of well - defined superbubbles have been identified in the galaxy ( e.g. heiles 1984 ; maciejewski et  al .",
    "1996 ; normandeau et al .",
    "1996 ; heiles 1998 ; ehlerov & palous 1999 ; callaway et  al .",
    "2000 ; reynolds et  al . 2001 ; mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2002 , pidopryhora et  al .",
    "these have been studied in detail , thanks to their relative proximity .",
    "observations with parsec - scale resolution of neutral and ionized gas reveal important details about the interaction between the hot ejecta and the interstellar medium .",
    "new high - resolution surveys of galactic atomic hydrogen ( hi ) emission @xcite have provided unprecedented images with morphological and kinematic information of galactic superbubbles @xcite .",
    "physically interesting parameters are usually derived from the observations by means of analytic models that assume spherical symmetry @xcite or axial symmetry @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the importance of mhd effects on physical quantities derived from observed superbubbles .",
    "the effect of the galactic magnetic field is difficult to model because it introduces anisotropy in the medium , which requires three - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "the first three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of superbubbles were presented by @xcite , who discussed the importance of the magnetic field in the break - out of superbubbles from the galactic disk .",
    "@xcite also described significant departures from spherical and axial symmetry in the shape of a magnetized bubble resulting from the interaction of the expanding superbubble with the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the shape and the size of a superbubble depend on the strength and the geometry of the galactic magnetic field as much as they depend on the density distribution of the ambient interstellar medium .",
    "the expanding superbubble in turn redefines the geometry of the interstellar medium and the galactic magnetic field in a volume several hundred parsecs across .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed thee - dimensional mhd simulations that include the evolution of a superbubble in a supernova - driven turbulent multi - phase interstellar medium .",
    "the super bubbles in these simulations show significant departures form symmetry because of inhomogeneities in the medium in which the super bubble expands . @xcite and @xcite found that a super bubble can break out into the halo in such a medium .",
    "although these simulations provide valuable insight in the dynamics of superbubbles in a multi - phase interstellar medium , it is in general difficult to relate these simulations to specific observed super bubbles ( see however fuchs et  al .",
    "2006 for a simulation of the local bubble ) .",
    "astrophysical parameters derived from observations , such as the age and the energy of a superbubble , or the density distribution of the ambient medium have relied on symmetric analytic models that do not include a magnetic field .",
    "the departure from axial symmetry imposed by the magnetic field introduces systematic errors that have not been considered before . in this paper",
    "we present three - dimensional mhd simulations of superbubbles , and we explore the errors introduced by commonly used methods to determine basic parameters from observations . in particular , we study the axial ratio of the wind - blown cavity for different times and magnetic field configurations .",
    "the smaller simulation volume and time span used in our simulations compared to @xcite are more tailored to the latitude coverage of the galactic plane surveys .",
    "we also calculate the first images of faraday rotation by a magnetized superbubble derived from our simulations , and emphasize the importance of such simulations to make meaningful predictions in this area .",
    "we describe frequently used analytic models  2 and detail our numerical setup and methods in  3 .",
    "numerical results and the analysis of magnetic effects on derived parameters are presented  4 . the specific case of the w4 supperbubble",
    "is discussed in  5 .",
    "faraday rotation by magnetized superbubbles is discussed in  6 , and conclusions are presented in  7 .",
    "the exact shape and size of the bubble depends directly on the environment and the strength of the source . for weaker sources which produce bubbles",
    "whose extent are much smaller than the scale height of the gas in the galaxy , a solution with an approximately constant density profile may be considered .",
    "@xcite present a solution for a spherical wind - blown bubble expanding into a non - magnetized medium , in which the radius of the bubble varies according to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the outer shock of the shell , @xmath2 is the mechanical luminosity of the source , @xmath3 is the ambient density of the undisturbed interstellar medium , and @xmath4 is the age of the bubble in myr .",
    "the radius of the contact discontinuity was found to be @xmath5 by @xcite .    for larger bubbles , associated with powerful sources ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "the gravitational potential of the galactic disk produces a density gradient perpendicular to the plane of the disk . at early stages ,",
    "the @xcite solution can still be applied , but as the radius of the bubble exceeds the scale height of the surrounding medium , the density gradient of the surrounding medium affects the shape of the bubble .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter k60 ) proposed a solution for the evolution of a point explosion in a non - magnetized exponential atmosphere that can be applied to this situation .",
    "this solution is based on the assumptions that the thermal energy is a constant fraction of the energy deposited in the initial blast and that the energy distribution is uniform throughout the volume of the bubble except close to the shock front where the energy density can be two to three times the mean value ( see also bisnovatyi - kogan  &  silich 1995 ) .",
    "@xcite extended the kompaneets solution to describe continuous energy injection , which we use in this paper .",
    "the source is located at @xmath6 in an exponential atmosphere with scale height @xmath7 of the form @xmath8    the radius of the bubble in cylindrical coordinates takes the following form @xmath9 \\label{rbasu}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a dimensionless transformed time variable , @xmath11 is the adiabatic index , @xmath12 is the thermal energy of the bubble , and @xmath13 is the volume of the bubble .",
    "the independent variables are the mass density at @xmath6 ( @xmath14 ) , the scale height of the atmosphere ( @xmath7 ) , and the mechanical luminosity of the source ( @xmath2 ) , which determines @xmath12 .",
    "the unit of time in this model is then defined by @xmath15    for @xmath16 , equation ( [ rbasu ] ) reduces to two equations for the upper and lower boundary of the blast wave , @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively @xcite @xmath19    as @xmath20 approaches 2 , the top of the bubble in the kompaneets model expands to infinite height in a finite amount of time .",
    "physically , this means the shock acceleration in the z - direction becomes infinite because of the strong density gradient @xcite .",
    "the bottom of the bubble ( @xmath21 , equation [ zupperlower ] ) does not penetrate downward more than @xmath22 , its location at the time of blow - out .",
    "since the top of the kompaneets model reaches an infinite height in a finite amount of time , it can not be a valid solution at later times .",
    "however , it can provide an adequate solution at early times , if the initial conditions are consistent with the assumptions of the kompaneets model , i.e. negligible pressure of the ambient medium and negligible inertia of the swept up medium .    with the addition of a magnetic field , no three - dimensional analytic solutions exist .",
    "in order to capture the true evolution of the these bubbles numerical simulations need to be performed .",
    "we aim to include the physics of the galactic magnetic field in the interpretation of observed superbubbles .",
    "the derivation of physical quantities from the data , such as the scale height of the surrounding medium or the age of a superbubble is best served by a model that takes into account the magnetic field , but not the complications of a preprocessed interstellar medium .",
    "we do not include the effect of galactic differential rotation or a coriolis force on the superbubble in our simulations .",
    "@xcite found that the characteristic time scale for shear from differential galactic rotation is @xmath23320 myr while the time scale for shear due to rotation of the bubble by the coriolis force is @xmath2350 myr .",
    "these processes operate over significantly longer times scales than those considered here ( up to 20 myr ) .",
    "the evolution of the bubble will also be affected by heating and cooling processes . in this paper",
    "we discuss adiabatic simulations as an approximation of the situation where heating balances cooling throughout the life of the superbubble , while we use simulations with cooling to explore how the evolution changes if cooling dominates over heating .",
    "observations of ionized gas associated with superbubble shells indicate that a significant fraction of the mass in the shell may be photo - ionized by the central star cluster and the surrounding interstellar radiation field .",
    "the ionized mass in the shell of the orion - eridanus superbubble is @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the neutral mass of this shell was determined to be @xmath25 by @xcite , and @xmath26 by @xcite .",
    "these values indicate that 13 to 28% of the mass of the orion - eridanus shell is ionized by the stars inside the bubble .",
    "@xcite found equal amounts of neutral and ionized gas in the ophiuchus superbubble , that is possibly ionized from the outside as well as from the inside .",
    "the shell of the w4 superbubble @xcite is clearly visible by its thermal radio continuum emission and @xmath27 emission @xcite , but not in hi .",
    "photo - ionization of a substantial fraction of the mass of the shell indicates that heating by photoionization is a non - negligible term in the energy budget of the gas in the shell .",
    "simulations that include cooling without photo - ionization therefore neglect a significant heating term in the energy budget of the shell . for computational reasons we can not solve radiative transport in the three - dimensional mhd simulations .",
    "the absence of cooling in our current simulations corresponds with the approximation of equilibrium between heating and cooling in the shell . in section",
    "[ cooling - sec ] we discuss the effect of cooling on the axial ratios of the cavity .",

    "contrary to the exponential profile , the dl layer has an equatorial plane , @xmath71 , with density decreasing in both the positive and negative @xmath53 directions .",
    "this is the same density distribution adopted by @xcite .",
    "the dynamical importance of the magnetic field is set through the parameter @xmath43 , defined as the ratio between the gas pressure and magnetic pressure at @xmath72 @xmath73    the magnetic field strength is @xmath74 where the numeric expression was derived using @xmath75 .",
    "we consider two geometries of the magnetic field .",
    "the first is a constant field , i.e. the vertical scale height of the magnetic field is infinite ( @xmath76 ) , the other takes the scale height of the magnetic pressure to be equal to the scale height of the gas pressure ( @xmath77 everywhere ) .",
    "we refer to the constant @xmath78 case as equipartition although strictly speaking equipartition implies @xmath79 everywhere .",
    "the scale height of the galactic magnetic field is not well known .",
    "our initial conditions cover the possibility of a large scale height @xmath80 1 kpc corresponding to a magnetically dominated halo , and a small scale height ( equal to 2@xmath7 for an exponential atmosphere ) .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium is assured by imposing a gravitational potential that balances the gradient of the total pressure which is the sum of the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure .",
    "the maintenance of hydrostatic equilibrium was tested in simulations with no source for both atmospheres .",
    "the vertical velocity in these tests was less than @xmath81 after 10 myr simulated time .",
    "this is consistent with numerical errors and it has no effect on the results of our simulations .",
    "the source of the bubble is defined by its mechanical luminosity ( @xmath2 ) related to the mass loss rate ( @xmath82 ) and the outflow velocity ( @xmath44 ) according to @xmath83    the source is assigned a finite radius ( @xmath49 ) , determined by the spatial resolution of the simulation .",
    "the mass loss rate from the source is related to the outflow velocity and the radius of the source via @xmath84    solving for @xmath85 and converting to dimensionless variables , we find @xmath86    values for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are specified as initial conditions . at every time step , @xmath90 and @xmath89 are reset to their initial values to maintain constant momentum and energy input from the source . to simulate a point source ,",
    "the radius @xmath49 should be taken as small as possible . however , in the rectangular grid , the outflow from the source will be more isotropic if @xmath49 is more than a few times the grid size .",
    "a complication is that density is evaluated in the center of a pixel ( b - grid ) , whereas velocity is evaluated on the boundary of a pixel ( a - grid ) .",
    "this is part of a strategy to conserve mass in the simulations , but it introduces an asymmetry in the radius of a sphere when coordinates are rounded off to integer multiples of the grid size . to maintain an isotropic source",
    "while avoiding computationally intensive interpolations that must be performed every time step , the location of the source is oscillated in three dimensions by half a grid position every time step ( see figure  [ grid - fig ] ) .",
    "these excursions of the source along the three axes are incoherent , and average out most of the anisotropy introduced by the numerical grid for small @xmath49 .",
    "the isotropy of the source setup was tested in hydrodynamic simulations with no density gradient .",
    "these experiments showed that @xmath49 between two and three pixels results in good symmetry in the simulations . a small degree of anisotropy in the outflow of the source remains .",
    "this acts as a seed for the development of instabilities , but is not considered a problem for our analysis .",

    "this instability also occurs in the simulations of @xcite and may be similar to the magnetically enhanced rayleigh - taylor instability proposed by @xcite . at the time shown in figure  [ expconst_b_40 ] , the expansion of the cavity along the @xmath54 axis ( perpendicular to the magnetic field ) in the galactic plane has stalled as a result of magnetic tension .",

    "we limit the discussion to the range @xmath125 to 0.3 .",
    "one of the most visible effects of the magnetic field is on the size of the cavity .",
    "a decrease in @xmath78 by a factor of 30 results in a decrease in the vertical size of the cavity by a factor @xmath231.7 , independent of the density and magnetic field stratifications .",
    "the diameter of the cavity in the @xmath127 direction ( along the field lines ) increases by a factor of @xmath23 1.4 as @xmath78 decreases .",

    "when observed along the direction of the magnetic field , the shape of the cavity varies less , but the size of the cavity becomes significantly smaller .",
    "the thickness of the shell in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field also increases dramatically with increasing magnetic field strength .",
    "however , this happens at the expense of the amount of compression of gas in the shell , which becomes nearly invisible in the simulations with @xmath126 . in practice",
    ", the shell may not be detectable in real data confused with emission in the foreground and background , even for @xmath129 , if the magnetic field scale height is large ( see figure  [ expconst_b_40 ] ) .",
    "the increasing thickness of the shell along the @xmath128 axis is partly the result of the smaller extent of the cavity , partly because of a faster expansion of the outer shock , approximately by equal amounts . in simulations with a constant magnetic field ,",
    "the thickness of the shell at the top of the bubble increases mainly because of the fast upward expansion of the outer shock , and to a lesser amount by the smaller extent of the cavity . in the equipartition simulations ,",
    "the increased thickness of the top of the shell is mainly because of the smaller extent of the cavity . along the magnetic field lines ( @xmath127 ) , the thickness of the shell decreases as the magnetic field strength increases .",

    "figure  [ fig : castorcompare ] compares the time evolution of the semi - major axis of the contact discontinuity and the outer shock in the @xmath130 plane , for a sample of our simulations ( exph , dlh , expcbc , & dlcbc ) , with that of the @xcite model .",
    "the semi - major axis is defined as half the diameter along the @xmath127 axis at the level of the source .",
    "the expansion along the magnetic field lines at early times ( see figure  [ fig : castorcompare]a ) closely follows the hydrodynamic solution in accordance with @xcite .",

    "the radius of the contact discontinuity in the analytic model indeed agrees well with the radii of the contact discontinuity in our simulations at early times ( dashed curve in figure  [ fig : castorcompare ] ) . at later times ( figure  [ fig : castorcompare]b ) , the contact discontinuity in the expcbc and dlcbc simulations has proceeded further than the analytic solution ( dashed curve ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the contact discontinuity in the exph and dlh simulations lags behind the analytic solution .",
    "we interpret this behavior as the result of the hydrodynamic simulations breaking out of the disk , reducing the pressure inside the cavity , whereas the mhd simulations remain confined to the disk .",
    "we find that the location of the outer shock in these simulations is nearly the same even after 15 myr in agreement with results presented in @xcite .",
    "the discussion in the previous subsection shows that the magnetic field is as important as the density distribution of the medium in determining the shape of a superbubble .",
    "observationally , the shape of the cavity is most important because structures with a large contrast in density are most easily detected in hi  images of the galaxy .",

    "figure  [ x1x3ratio ] shows the relationship between the @xmath132 axial ratio and @xmath78 at an age of 5 myr and 12.5 myr .",

    "after 12.5 myr , the size of the bubble perpendicular to the magnetic field is only 60% of its size along the magnetic field .",

    "this confinement of the bubble by the magnetic field while maintaining an elongated shape of the cavity is the root cause of the 30% to 50% lower scale heights resulting from fits of the kompaneets model to a magnetized bubble .",

    "extended hi  images that cover the top of the h@xmath157 shell do not show a cap in the neutral gas @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath157 shell was interpreted as the inner wall of the superbubble ionized by the stars in ocl  352 .",
    "@xcite found that the age of the superbubble exceeds the maximum possible age of ocl  352 by a factor @xmath161 , using the mechanical luminosity of the star cluster ( @xmath162 ) and the density of the ambient medium ( @xmath163 ) given by @xcite .",
    "the large dynamical age of the bubble was taken as an indication that the star cluster ocl  352 by itself may not be the only source of the superbubble .",
    "@xcite found that the age of the bubble is consistent with the age of the star cluster by applying the k60 model to the w4 superbubble , assuming a scale height of only 25 pc for the ambient medium .",
    "however , @xcite noted that a lower ambient density could decrease the dynamical age derived for the w4 superbubble .",
    "the original hi  number density was derived by @xcite from an hi  column density map .",
    "this map was obtained by integration of the hi  brightness temperature over a velocity range of @xmath164 .",
    "the ambient density was then calculated by dividing the hi  column density adjacent to the cavity by the diameter of the bubble , assuming that all the hi  emission is local to the w4 superbubble .",
    "this assumption leads to a significant over - estimate of the ambient density , because hi  emission in the velocity range of the bubble originates from a much longer section of the line of sight .",
    "we re - analyzed the hi  data of the w4 region , now publicly available as part of the canadian galactic plane survey @xcite , to re - determine the ambient density .",
    "the hi  column density inside the cavity of the w4 superbubble , avoiding the hi  features known to be inside the cavity @xcite , is @xmath165 .",
    "the medium inside the superbubble is expected to be a highly ionized tenuous plasma at a temperature of a few million kelvin .",
    "the ionized bubble wall seen on both sides of the cavity in radio continuum and h@xmath157 emission shows that the interior of the bubble is optically thin to lyman continuum photons . @xcite and",
    "@xcite assume this to be true in their analysis of the ionization of the bubble wall by the star cluster .",
    "therefore , hi  observed inside the cavity must be located in the foreground and the background .",
    "some of this hi  emission could in principle belong to the bubble wall if the expansion of the superbubble had stalled .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the expansion of the bubble has stalled because the source is still active .",
    "although the evidence that the hi  steamers identified by @xcite are located inside the cavity of the w4 bubble is compelling , the hi  emission that seems to partly fill the cavity everywhere is likely unrelated gas , that was included in the density estimate of @xcite .",
    "if the hi  column density inside the cavity is subtracted , the density of the ambient medium is reduced to @xmath166 assuming the same line - of - sight dimension of the bubble",
    ". a better estimate of the density of the ambient medium is obtained by dividing the mass of the shell of swept - up gas by the volume of the cavity .",
    "this is impractical for the w4 bubble because there is no clear limb - brightened hi  shell visible in the column density map .",
    "@xcite found a higher density of 10 @xmath167 from their analysis of the shape of the ionization front , which depends on the details of their model .",
    "although the lower value of the ambient density derived from the hidata may not resolve the age problem altogether , we follow the suggestion by @xcite that the location of the cluster is strong evidence for its identification as the source of the superbubble .",
    "we now return to the issue of the small scale height found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found no evidence for such a small scale height in hi  images of the region , but , as noted before , the hi  images are contaminated to some extent by emission in the foreground and background .",
    "the presence of molecular gas with a small scale height may have contributed to the result obtained by @xcite , but the molecular gas traced by the co line appears too fragmented to confine the shape of the bubble .",
    "the scale height found by fitting the kompaneets model to the observed shape of the bubble may also be artificially small by a factor 2 ( see  [ comparingkomp ] ) for an observer looking along the magnetic field parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "this factor is not enough to explain the very small scale height derived by @xcite .",
    "also , the age derived by @xcite would be too small by a factor 2 , further increasing the discrepancy between the dynamical age of the bubble and the age of the star cluster .",
    "none of our simulations evolve into a cavity that is as narrow as the w4 super bubble .",
    "polarimetric observations of the galactic plane at arcminute resolution @xcite allow measurements of faraday rotation of diffuse galactic synchrotron radiation and background compact extragalactic sources to probe the magneto - ionic interstellar medium down to parsec scales .",
    "the plane of polarization of linearly polarized synchrotron emission rotates by an angle @xmath168 ( radians ) as the radiation passes through a magnetized plasma according to @xmath169 , with @xmath170 the wavelength of the radiation in meters .",
    "the line - of - sight integral @xmath171 is the rotation measure ( radians @xmath172 ) , with @xmath173 the electron density ( @xmath167 ) , and @xmath174 the magnetic field vector @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) projected onto the line of sight ( in parsec ) .",
    "the rotation measure can be determined observationally by observing @xmath177 at different , but closely spaced wavelengths .",
    "structure along the line of sight may create a measurable rotation of the plane of polarization , but it may not have a sufficiently large emission measure for any thermal emission to be detected .    equation  ( [ rmequation ] ) can not be inverted to obtain a unique solution to the magnetic field structure , even if independent information on the electron density @xmath173 along the line of sight is available . instead , the data can be interpreted by line - of - sight integration of a model distribution of the density and magnetic field , which depends critically on the assumed distributions of the electron density and magnetic field . if an ad hoc model for density and magnetic field is adopted to interpret the observations , careful consideration should be given to basic questions regarding self - consistency , uniqueness and dynamical properties of the proposed model .",
    "our three - dimensional mhd simulations of magnetized superbubbles constitute a significant step forward in the modeling of faraday rotation by galactic superbubbles . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the bubble as a faraday screen that does not emit synchrotron emission .",
    "this situation applies in particular to compact polarized sources in the background .",
    "the simulations provide a self - consistent set of models that can be used to calculate the rotation measure imposed on background emission by a magnetized superbubble .",
    "the non - spherical evolution of the superbubble described in section  [ simulations ] may have very significant effects on the predicted rotation measure .",
    "the effect of nearby superbubbles on faraday rotation of background sources was first discussed by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss only the faraday rotation signature of distant bubbles , for which we can assume that all lines of sight are parallel .",
    "we assume here that the bubble is completely ionized .",
    "this allows a first exploration of the general effects of the topology of the density and magnetic field , without introducing more parameters .",
    "figure  [ rm - fig ] shows the rotation measure for a line of sight along the @xmath54 axis ( looking perpendicular to the galactic magnetic field ) and the @xmath52 axis ( looking along the galactic magnetic field ) of the simulation dlcbc ( table  [ simsrun ] ) at an age of 10 myr ( figure  [ b40fig ] ) .",
    "the line - of - sight integration of equation  ( [ rmequation ] ) was done through the entire simulated volume as shown in figure  [ b40fig ] .",
    "it includes some undisturbed medium in the foreground and the background of the bubble .",
    "comparing the rotation measure maps with the density and magnetic field structure ( figure  [ b40fig ] ) reveals some general characteristics of the faraday rotation of all bubbles in our simulations .",
    "as the magnetic field is pushed aside , the field lines wrap around the expanding cavity .",
    "the largest amplification and the largest change of direction of the magnetic field occur just outside the cavity , in the equatorial plane ( for the dl density distribution ) .",
    "the density is also enhanced , compared with the surrounding undisturbed interstellar medium , but by different amounts depending on location in the shell .",
    "simulations with a small scale height of the galactic magnetic field ( @xmath178 ) show this compression also at the top of the bubble , whereas simulations with a large scale height of the magnetic field ( constant b ) do not .",
    "the largest faraday rotation therefore occurs in a relatively thin region around the cavity , being strongest close to the galactic plane ( see figure  [ rm - fig ] ) .",
    "the faraday rotation inside the cavity is much smaller by comparison , because of the low density and the low chaotic magnetic field there .    if the line of sight is perpendicular to the direction of the undisturbed magnetic field , the near and the far side of the bubble wall have rotation measures up to @xmath23100 radians @xmath172 , with opposite signs .",
    "these mostly cancel each other , but asymmetries between the front side and the back side of the shell create structure in the rotation measure distribution .",
    "asymmetries arise from the instabilities in the shell mentioned in sections  [ expcbande ]  &  [ analysis ] .",
    "the strongest signal is expected from asymmetries that occur in locations where a perfectly symmetric bubble would have bent the galactic magnetic field sufficiently to create a significant line of sight component of the magnetic field .",
    "as the magnetic field is tightly wrapped around the cavity , the highest values of the rotation measure resulting from front - to - back asymmetries are therefore expected for lines of sight that intersect the cavity , away from the vertical axis that intersects the source .",
    "our three - dimensional simulations contain such asymmetries , resulting in the structures seen in figure  [ rm - fig ] with amplitudes of the order of 20 radians @xmath172 .    if the line of sight is parallel to the direction of the undisturbed magnetic field , rotation measures are much higher everywhere than in the previous case .",
    "the front and back side of the shell reinforce each other , and high rotation measures are expected for lines of sight that intersect the shell .",
    "the top of the bubble increases the rotation measure a few hundred parsecs above the galactic plane by @xmath179 compared with the undisturbed atmosphere in figure  [ rm - fig ] . for the simulation dlebc ( small magnetic scale height ) ,",
    "the increase is @xmath180 compared with the undisturbed atmosphere . within 100 pc from the galactic plane , the rotation measure varies with location because of the bubble , but the mean of the rotation measure across the bubble is almost the same as the mean rotation measure of the undisturbed atmosphere . here , the effect of the bubble is to create a significant variation in rotation measure for different lines of sight , with little effect on the mean rotation measure taken over a large area .",
    "super bubble shells may therefore enhance the rotation measure in the disk - halo interface and affect estimates of the scale height of the galactic magnetic field from rotation measure analysis .",
    "@xcite reported a large magnetized bubble associated with the gum nebula , based on a number of high rotation measures towards extragalactic sources .",
    "recently , @xcite found this bubble in an all - sky image of depolarization of extragalactic sources , that was associated with excess rotation measure .",
    "this bubble stands out in the data because of the high rotation measure in the shell .",
    "the line of sight in this case is nearly parallel to the magnetic field in the local spiral arm .",
    "so far we have discussed adiabatic simulations of super bubbles as an approximation that energy losses are compensated by an internal or an external radiation field . in this section",
    "we briefly discuss simulations with cooling in the two main density stratifications discussed in this paper : the exponential atmosphere and the dickey & lockman atmosphere .",
    "the cooling represents an extra term in the energy equation ( 10 ) and is implemented as an explicit source term in the code .",
    "as with all physical processes , there is a maximum allowed time step for numerical stability associated with the cooling ; in our case it is reset to 10% of the radiative cooling time when it is below the normal hydrodynamic cfl condition .",
    "the cooling function by @xcite and @xcite , using the abundances of @xcite , was implemented into zeus - mp in the form of analytic expressions adopted by @xcite .",
    "although some abundances were revised downwards later , the difference between the cooling rates adopted in our simulations and the solar abundance cooling curve of @xcite is smaller than other sources of uncertainty introduced by finite resolution , and ionization by the central star cluster .",
    "if an accuracy better than a factor @xmath161 is required in the cooling rate , the location of the superbubble in the galaxy also becomes important because of variation in the abundances with location in the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the radiatively cooled simulations were done in atmospheres maintained at a temperature of 8000 k , with the same resolution as the adiabatic simulations discussed in section  [ simulations ] , and with the same mechanical luminosity of the source . in these simulations , cooling begins at a time @xmath181 myr , soon after the first supernova explosion , at the beginning of the radiative phase following @xcite .",
    "the effects of cooling on the shape of the cavity are evaluated at @xmath182 myr .",
    "figure  [ expconst_b_40_cool ] and figure  [ dlconst_b_40_cool ] show simulations of a bubble with cooling in an exponential atmosphere and in a dickey & lockman atmosphere at an age og 10 myr .",
    "these figures can be compared with the adiabatic simulations shown in figure  [ expconst_b_40 ] and figure  [ b40fig ] .",
    "qualitatively the features in these simulations are very similar .",
    "the cavity is elongated along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the shell is thicker in directions perpendicular to the magnetic field in the undisturbed atmosphere ( @xmath183 and @xmath128 ) , while significant compression of the swept - up material in the direction of the magnetic field leads to a thinner , denser shell .",
    "closer inspection shows that the cavities of both cooled simulations are more elongated in the direction of the magnetic field ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the shell also seems to display stronger instabilities , leading to irregularities in the shape of the cavity , and increased scatter in the derived axial ratios of the cavity . as expected , the simulations with cooling lead to shells that are thinner , with a higher density and stronger magnetic field , than the adiabatic simulations .",
    "the effect of resolution on the cooled regions is to smear out small - scale high - density structure with the shortest cooling time and the lowest temperature .",
    "@xcite found convergence in the maximum density and lowest temperature in their simulations for a grid size @xmath184 pc .",
    "the density and temperature inside the swept - up shell in our simulations are probably also affected by resolution , but this paper focuses on the shape of the bubble , not the conditions inside the shell .",
    "@xcite found that the shape of planetary nebulae in their simulations was not affected by resolution .",
    "figure  [ axial_ratio_cool - fig ] shows the evolution of the axial ratios as a function of time in these simulations .",
    "we find that the axial ratio @xmath185 of a bubble in the dickey & lockman atmosphere is most affected by cooling ( compare figure  [ axial_ratio_cool - fig]a with figures  [ x2x1ratiodl ] and [ x2x1ratiodl ] ) . in the adiabatic simulation , the cavity remains nearly circular to an age of 10 myr , while in the cooled simulation the cavity is more elongated in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "note the change in evolution of the @xmath185 axial ratio just after the onset of cooling .",
    "the effect of cooling on the axial ratio @xmath185 compared with the adiabatic case is less strong for the exponential atmosphere , but here too the cavity becomes more elongated in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "a stronger elongation is also seen in the @xmath131 axial ratio ( compare figure  [ axial_ratio_cool - fig]b with figure  [ fig : x3x1conv ] ) , but the effect is smaller than on the axial ratio @xmath185 .    the observed change in axial ratios in the presence of cooling is most likely the result of increased magnetic tension exerted by the stronger magnetic field in the dense shell that surrounds the cavity .",
    "this restricts the expansion perpendicular to the field ( @xmath183 and @xmath128 ) more in the cooled simulations than in the adiabatic simulations .",
    "coupling between he magnetic field and the neutral shell is maintained through a small ionized fraction in the shell , and ion - neutral collisions .",
    "a complete parameter study of simulations with cooling is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "at least some superbubbles have a substantial fraction of the mass of the shell ionized by the stars inside . in simulations with cooling , the cooling time of the shell",
    "is very short compared to the age of the bubble , and a dense neutral shell forms .",
    "ideally , radiative transport of the ionizing flux of the star cluster and any unrelated massive hot stars in the simulation volume should be included in the simulations . solving the radiative transport",
    "every time step in the simulations is a computational challenge .",
    "the mean free path of an ionizing photon is substantially smaller than the resolution of the simulations .",
    "the ionizing flux decreases rapidly with time as the most massive stars explode as a supernova after @xmath23 3 myr , and the shell will eventually cool and become neutral .",
    "the implicit assumption in this paper by applying adiabatic evolution to this problem is that heating by photo - ionization is balanced by cooling .",
    "while this is a simplification , the observed ionization of superbubble walls suggests that heating by ionization of the shell is a non - negligible term in the energy equation of the shell that is not included in simuations with cooling only .",
    "we present three - dimensional mhd simulations of a superbubble evolving in a magnetized medium . in these simulations ,",
    "we assume two different atmospheric models , exponential and dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) , and two different magnetic field configurations , constant magnetic field and constant @xmath78 , for varying values of the magnetic field strength . with these simulations",
    "we aim to study the importance of mhd effects on the interpretation of observed superbubbles .    as noted before by @xcite , a superbubble in a magnetized medium",
    "becomes significantly elongated along the magnetic field .",
    "we find that the axial ratio of the bubble in the galactic plane is @xmath23 0.8 after 5 myr and @xmath186 after 12.5 myr , depending on the age of the bubble and the strength of the magnetic field but not on the vertical structure of either the magnetic field or the gas .",
    "the elongated shape of the bubble in the galactic plane may lead to significant errors in the age determination of magnetized superbubbles from observations using symmetric hydrodynamic models .",
    "the derived age depends on the location of the observer .",
    "the ratio of the smallest age to the largest age derived by observers assuming axial or spherical symmetry is found to be proportional to the square of the axial ratio of the bubble in the galactic plane , which creates a discrepancy in the age of up to a factor @xmath234 .",
    "we have analyzed systematic errors in the age of the bubble and the scale height of the ambient medium introduced by fitting the kompaneets model to a magnetized superbubble looking along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the scale height may be underestimated by 30% to 50% and the age by 50% . in particular , we investigated the curiously small scale height of the interstellar medium near the w4 superbubble found by @xcite .",
    "we re - analyzed hi data from the canadian galactic plane survey and found that the density of the ambient medium @xmath187 which is smaller than previously thought .",
    "this lower density helps to diminish the apparent age discrepancy between the w4 bubble and the star cluster ocl 352 .",
    "however , our analysis of the systematic errors introduced by fitting the kompaneets model shows that they are not big enough to explain the scale height of 25 pc found by @xcite for the w4 region .",
    "we use the mhd simulations to predict the rotation measure distribution of superbubbles based on three - dimensional mhd simulations , and emphasize the importance of such simulations to make these predictions . as expected , the appearance of a magnetized superbubble depends on the perspective of the observer .",
    "if the observer looks along the magnetic field lines , the largest rotation measures are seen at the intersection of the shell with the galactic plane .",
    "the rotation measure is increased at larger distances from the galactic plane .",
    "if an observer in the galactic plane looks perpendicular to the magnetic field lines , the rotation measures are much smaller , but most importantly most of the structure in rotation measure appears in projection on the low - density cavity , and not on the shell surrounding it .    the simulations and analysis presented in this paper highlight the importance of three - dimensional mhd simulations of superbubbles evolving in the galactic magnetic field to the interpretation of new high - resolution images of the galactic plane at radio wavelengths from the international galactic plane survey .",
    "this research has been enabled by the use of westgrid computing resources , which are funded in part by the canada foundation for innovation , alberta innovation and science , bc advanced education , and the participating research institutions .",
    "westgrid equipment is provided by ibm , hewlett packard and sgi",
    "we show that the kompaneets solution at early times can be approximated as an expanding sphere with a center that moves upward from the location of the source .",
    "this analytic derivation explains quantitatively the behavior of the kompaneets solution in figure  [ kompaneetsfig ] .",
    "the center of the bubble along the vertical axis follows from the expressions for the top and bottom of the bubble ( equation  [ zupperlower ] ) @xmath188 . \\label{komp_center}\\ ] ] the half - diameter of the kompaneets solution in the vertical direction is @xmath189 .",
    "\\label{komp_radius_z}\\ ] ] the maximum radius @xmath190 of the kompaneets solution in a direction perpendicular to the density gradient was given by @xcite and @xcite , @xmath191 the taylor expansion of @xmath192 , @xmath193 , and @xmath190 in @xmath194 to third order in @xmath29 is @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the remainder that contains terms of order @xmath197 or higher .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath198 and @xmath199 so the difference @xmath200 is of order @xmath201 @xmath202 we see that for small @xmath29 , the shift in the centre is @xmath203 , which is of second order in @xmath29 .",
    "the difference @xmath200 is of third order in @xmath29 .",

    "the offset is clear , where the kompaneets model is still visually a circle .",
