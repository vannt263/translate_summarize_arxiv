    "topological superconductors ( tscs ) and superfluids are one of the central issues in the modern condensed matter physics . @xcite they are theoretically proposed in an extremely wide range of contexts , such as ultracold atoms @xcite as well as electron systems in solids : from one - dimensional ( 1d ) nanowires @xcite and two - dimensional ( 2d ) thin films @xcite to bulk three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems .",
    "@xcite however , many of these suggestions assume rather hard situations to achieve in experiments : some require special band structures by fine - tuning of parameters , @xcite and others assume odd - parity superconductivity @xcite and/or chiral superconductivity with spontaneously - broken time - reversal symmetry @xcite which rarely appear in real superconductors ( scs ) with a few exceptions .",
    "@xcite therefore , the research field for tscs is still limited at present .",
    "the topological superconducting states in familiar materials are desired , though indications for tscs have been already obtained by a few state - of - the - art experiments .",
    "@xcite    recent theoretical studies point to topological crystalline scs protected by crystal symmetry @xcite or to gapless scs specified by a weak ( low - dimensional ) topological index .",
    "@xcite in contrast to these tscs , strong tscs are specified by a strong topological index and protected only by local symmetry .",
    "the complete classification has been summarized in the topological periodic table .",
    "@xcite strong tscs are believed to be robust against perturbations such as disorders and interactions because of their gapped energy spectrum and the symmetry protection .",
    "@xcite therefore , a design of strong tscs may pave a new way to experimental studies for the topological superconductivity .",
    "in particular , a design of strong tscs based on spin - singlet scs is desired .",
    "although most of real scs are induced by the condensation of spin - singlet cooper pairs , gapful spin - singlet scs are usually topologically - trivial . the mainstream of research field has been naturally limited to the exceptional case , namely , the topologically - nontrivial @xmath0-wave scs .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , we are familiar to nodal spin - singlet scs in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "@xcite for instance , the @xmath5-wave scs have been identified to be gapless tscs specified by a low - dimensional topological invariant .",
    "@xcite however , gapless excitations in the bulk may be harmful for the topological response .",
    "the gapful superconducting phase generated from the nodal scs has not been recognized in previous studies .    in this paper",
    ", we show that originally _ gapless",
    "_ scs lacking inversion symmetry may be _ gapful _ tscs under the magnetic field .",
    "our idea is based on a numerical study of the 2d @xmath1-wave scs .",
    ".   showed that noncentrosymmetric 2d @xmath1-wave scs are nodal at zero magnetic field , but they become gapful tscs under the magnetic field .",
    "we generalize this scenario for the _ paramagnetically - induced gapful tscs _ , by deriving analytic expressions of the excitation spectrum and the chern number . the mechanism for realizing gapful tscs is applicable to most of noncentrosymmetric nodal scs with time - reversal symmetry , and relies on neither specific symmetry of superconductivity nor electronic structure .",
    "in particular , a spin - singlet sc is rather likely to be topologically nontrivial , in sharp contrast to the fact that most of the time - reversal - invariant tscs are spin - triplet scs .",
    "@xcite importantly , we are familiar to nodal spin - singlet scs although we hardly encounter a spin - triplet sc in materials .",
    "@xcite it is stressed that our scenario for realizing gapful tscs does not need any fine - tuning of the chemical potential , in contrast to proposals for topological @xmath0-wave scs @xcite whose platform is limited to artificial systems such as cold atoms and semiconductors . for these reasons , this paper may significantly extend the research field on topological superconducting materials , especially in natural solid - state systems .",
    "the outline of this paper is illustrated as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : body1 ] , we show an analytic expression of the excitation spectrum and discuss the gap - generation mechanism in nodal noncentrosymmetric scs .",
    "the excitation gap emerges from the cooperation of the broken inversion symmetry in crystal structures and the broken time - reversal symmetry due to the magnetic field .",
    "the broken inversion symmetry leads to unusual magnetic responses of scs robust against the paramagnetic effect , which were experimentally demonstrated in transition - metal dichalcogenides .",
    "@xcite the broken time - reversal symmetry is required in order to break the topological protection of the gap node .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec : body2 ] , we derive the chern number in the paramagnetically - induced gapful phases . analyzing the general formula , we show that most of dominantly - spin - singlet scs are tscs . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] , we introduce several models for paramagnetically - induced tscs and numerically verify the analytic formula obtained in secs .",
    "[ sec : body1 ] and [ sec : body2 ] .",
    "the models introduced are @xmath1-wave tsc , extended @xmath2-wave tsc , @xmath3-wave tsc , and @xmath4-wave tsc . finally , we discuss experimental setup for the tscs in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiments ] , and give a brief summary in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we introduce a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian describing parity - mixed scs under a zeeman field : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian in the normal state .",
    "the first term is a kinetic energy measured from a chemical potential @xmath8 , the second term is an antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling ( asoc ) , and the last term is a zeeman field . the zeeman field may be induced by an applied magnetic field or by a proximity to ferromagnet .",
    "we here consider the former case , for simplicity .",
    "the latter case may be described by the same model .",
    "we assume @xmath9 without loss of generality .",
    "the superconducting gap function is given by @xmath10 , where the even - parity component @xmath11 and odd - parity one @xmath12 may be admixed because of the broken inversion symmetry .",
    "in this section , we clarify the effect of zeeman field on the gap structure without assuming any specific symmetry of superconductivity .",
    "what we assume is only the existence of excitation nodes at zero magnetic field .",
    "the orbital effect of the magnetic field is neglected in the following discussions .",
    "experimental situations for our setup will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiments ] .",
    "first , we show quasiparticle energy bands in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "two electron bands , @xmath13 are obtained in the normal state as a result of the zeeman - type splitting by asoc .",
    "the @xmath14-electrons have spin parallel / antiparallel to the @xmath15 vector , @xmath16 and there may be two fermi surfaces ( fss ) defined by @xmath17 . in the following expressions , we may omit the variable in @xmath18 , @xmath14 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , and denote @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , for simplicity .",
    "the bdg hamiltonian in @xmath25 -coordinates has the form    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is a @xmath5 vector in the new coordinates .",
    "first - order perturbation theory with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath29 shows that the off - diagonal matrix element between the @xmath30-bands , i.e. @xmath31 serves as the gap - opening term .",
    "for this reason , @xmath32 is regarded as the gap function in the @xmath33-band . in the same way",
    ", @xmath34 is the gap function in the @xmath35-band .",
    "energy spectrum of bogoliubov quasiparticles is given by @xmath36 equation   reveals that the direction of the @xmath15 vector , namely , the spin polarization axis at each @xmath37 relative to the @xmath5 vector , is crucial for the gap structure .",
    "this fact plays an essential role on the gap - generation demonstrated in the next subsection .",
    "in contrast to the isotropic @xmath0-wave scs , the order parameter in the band basis , @xmath38 , may have some zeros in nodal scs .",
    "then , a gap node appears on fss , and the electron band @xmath14 touches to the hole band @xmath39 at the nodes .",
    "this is the situation we consider in this paper .",
    "second , we elucidate the excitation spectrum around the nodes under a magnetic field . for the clarity , the magnetic field",
    "should be decomposed into two parts at each @xmath37 : @xmath40 where the first term is parallel to @xmath41 and the second term is the perpendicular component : @xmath42\\,\\hat{g}(\\bm{k}),\\\\    \\bm{h}_\\perp(\\bm{k})\\equiv\\hat{g}(\\bm{k})\\times\\bigl[\\bm{h}\\times\\hat{g}(\\bm{k})\\bigr].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] since the @xmath14-bands show spin texture polarized to the @xmath43-direction , the parallel component @xmath44 just increases or decreases the spin splitting . on the other hand , the perpendicular component @xmath45 modifies the spin texture , and therefore",
    ", it may modify the gap function .",
    "indeed , a new gap - opening term arises from the perpendicular component .",
    "we obtain the energy spectrum of bogoliubov quasiparticles around the gap nodes originating from the @xmath33-band : @xmath46 equation   is obtained by the perturbation theory with respect to @xmath47 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , with the non - perturbative hamiltonian @xmath48 note that the contribution from the perpendicular magnetic field is non - perturbatively taken into account .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath49 for energy spectrum around the gap nodes in the @xmath35-band .",
    "the derivation of eqs .   and",
    "is shown in appendix a.    equations   and , the main result of this section , are valid as long as the conditions @xmath50 are satisfied around the nodes .",
    "these conditions are likely to be satisfied in the low magnetic field region , unless the gap nodes are located at zeros of the @xmath15 vector , such as time - reversal invariant momenta .",
    "we discuss the exceptional cases in the next subsection .    in the following part of this paper , we consider scs which are time - reversal - invariant at zero magnetic field .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath51 and @xmath52 without loss of generality , @xcite although eqs .   and are also valid for complex - valued order parameters in time - reversal - symmetry - broken chiral scs .",
    "the 2d chiral scs are gapful and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is true that the @xmath5 vector acquires an additional complex - valued component by the paramagnetic effect .",
    "however , such admixed component is negligible , because its amplitude is considerably small @xcite and its effect is just to slightly change the minimum of the induced excitation gap .    under the reasonable conditions , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , eqs .   and are reduced to @xmath53 from eq .",
    "we understand that the modified spin texture due to the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath54 gives rise to a gap - opening term @xmath55 .",
    "owing to this term , the order parameter in the band basis looks like a chiral sc with the gap function @xmath56 [ see eqs .   and ] . the _ chiral gap function _",
    "@xmath57 may make superconducting state fully gapped .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the time - reversal - symmetry breaking .",
    "the time - reversal - invariant nodal parity - mixed scs acquire an excitation gap under the magnetic field when @xmath58 this condition is satisfied by appropriately adjusting the direction of the magnetic field . for eq .   to be satisfied",
    ", the @xmath5 vector must have a component perpendicular to the @xmath15 vector at the nodes so that @xmath59 .",
    "this component is expected to be finite in general .",
    "it is true that the @xmath5 vector in noncentrosymmetric scs tends to be parallel to the @xmath15 vector , as it is thermodynamically favored by the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xcite however , the relation @xmath60 is not imposed by any point group symmetry , and hence a perpendicular component in general exists .",
    "for example , we here consider heterostructures of cuprate scs .",
    "@xcite the dominant order parameter may be a @xmath61-wave one such as @xmath62 as it is in the bulk .",
    "then , the superconducting state belongs to the @xmath63 irreducible representation of the @xmath64 point group .",
    "the admixed spin - triplet order parameter naturally belongs to the @xmath63 representation .",
    "the basis function is @xmath65 when we assume cooper pairs on nearest - neighbor bonds .",
    "since the asoc has to belong to the identity ( @xmath66 ) representation , the relation @xmath67 is not supported by symmetry .",
    "indeed , one of the simplest basis functions of the @xmath15 vector is rashba - type @xmath68 .",
    "hence , the @xmath5 vector is not parallel to the @xmath15 vector at the nodal directions , @xmath69 @xmath70 $ ] or @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "another example is the interface of sr@xmath72ruo@xmath73 .",
    "microscopic calculations reveal the @xmath63 superconducting state in the presence of the rashba asoc .",
    "@xcite then , the spin - triplet component is dominant , but @xmath74 as in the spin - singlet dominant case .    it should be noted that @xmath75 is finite even when the order parameter belongs to the @xmath66 representation . in this case , the @xmath15 vector and the @xmath5 vector belong to the same representation .",
    "however , we have @xmath59 in general because the basis function of a certain irreducible representation is not unique .",
    "according to the microscopic calculation of asoc based on multi - orbital models , the @xmath15 vector has a complex momentum dependence in the presence of the orbital degeneracy .",
    "@xcite for this reason , a theoretical study on cept@xmath76si @xcite showed a @xmath5 vector which is far from parallel to the @xmath15 vector .",
    "these examples demonstrate that the assumption @xmath77 is not supported by microscopic theories as pointed out in ref .  , although this assumption is adopted in many phenomenological models .",
    "thus , the condition for the gap - opening may be satisfied in most nodal parity - mixed scs .",
    "let us assume the magnetic field perpendicular to the @xmath15 vector in the whole 2d brillouin zone ( bz ) : @xmath78 this situation is realized when the magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath79-axis in rashba systems [ @xmath80 or when the field is perpendicular to the @xmath79-axis and the asoc is the zeeman - type [ @xmath81 .",
    "@xcite then , the paramagnetic term @xmath82 in eqs .   and disappears , and we obtain the induced local energy gap at each gap nodes : @xmath83 global excitation gap @xmath84 is the minimum of eq .   among nodes at @xmath85 .",
    "equation   is roughly estimated as follows .",
    "first , we discuss spin - singlet - dominant scs .",
    "most of the noncentrosymmetric scs are classified into the case .",
    "the amplitude of admixed spin - triplet component @xmath21 is estimated by @xmath86 @xcite with @xmath87 being the fermi energy .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a typical magnitude of the spin - singlet order parameter .",
    "the larger @xmath90 and @xmath91 are , the larger gap @xmath84 we obtain .",
    "for this reason , high - transition - temperature scs may give a large induced gap . in this sense , the cuprate @xcite and iron - selenide @xcite thin films may be suitable for experimental studies .",
    "artificial heterostructures of heavy fermion sc , cecoin@xmath92 , @xcite may also be a good platform , because of its small fermi energy and large @xmath90 .",
    "the energy gap is roughly estimated to be @xmath93 in cuprate high - temperature scs with @xmath94 , when @xmath95 is adopted . @xcite it should be noticed that eq .",
    "is independent of the magnitude of the asoc .",
    "therefore , a small spin - orbit coupling does not decrease the induced gap , although the spin - orbit coupling is actually small in cuprate and iron - based scs .",
    "next , we consider spin - triplet - dominant scs . in this case , we simply obtain @xmath96 with @xmath97 being a typical magnitude of the spin - triplet order parameter .",
    "the induced gap is large in materials with a small asoc and a high transition temperature .",
    "note that eq .",
    "is @xmath98 times as large as eq .",
    ", when we assume @xmath99 . therefore , spin - triplet - dominant scs may acquire a large excitation gap .",
    "the interface of sr@xmath72ruo@xmath73 may be such an example , because a small asoc is obtained from the first - principles band structure calculation .",
    "@xcite      in this subsection , exceptional cases are discussed .",
    "we investigate the time - reversal - invariant scs which show gap nodes at zeros of the @xmath15 vector .",
    "formula for the energy spectrum , eqs .   and , is not justified in this case .",
    "although the fs of 2d materials hardly crosses zeros of the @xmath15 vector , following results are useful for the analysis of 3d weyl scs .",
    "energy spectrum on zeros of the @xmath15 vector is given by @xmath100 in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we have gap nodes right on zeros of the @xmath15 vector only when fs is right on the @xmath37 points where @xmath101 are satisfied . these conditions , eqs .   and , are hardly satisfied at the same time , without any symmetry requirements .",
    "thus , only the case which we have to consider is a situation where fs crosses `` symmetry - protected zeros '' ( spzs ) defined by @xmath102 actually , the order parameter of non-@xmath0-wave scs may vanish at symmetric points of bz owing to the symmetry , and the @xmath15 vector may also disappear there .",
    "for instance , the @xmath1-wave superconductivity in the 2d rashba systems [ see sec .  [ subsec : d+pgapful ] ] shows the spzs at @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "it is true that the @xmath15 vector may have zeros which are not protected by symmetry .",
    "for instance , the zeros appear as a result of the nontrivial topological defects in the @xmath15 vector .",
    "@xcite however , no symmetry protects @xmath105 there , and gap node does not appear in most cases .",
    "the energy spectrum of bogoliubov quasiparticles around the spz is calculated by analyzing the `` high - magnetic - field region '' , @xmath106 carrying out a similar calculation to sec .",
    "[ subsec : gap - generation ] , we obtain the energy spectrum [ see appendix  [ sec : hdomspectrum ] for the derivation ] , @xmath107 when the direction of zeeman field is adjusted so that @xmath108 , the conditions for excitation nodes are given by : @xmath109 a system of eqs .   and has a unique solution , @xmath110 , unless the two equations have an accidental solution . therefore , we obtain nodal excitations only when @xmath111 otherwise , the excitation is gapful . interestingly , the high - field phase defined by @xmath112 is topologically distinct from the low - field phase where @xmath113 .",
    "for instance ,",
    ".   determines the phase boundary of the @xmath114 phase in fig .",
    "[ fig_exs](c ) .",
    "note that the chern number in the high - field phase is beyond the applicability of the formula given in sec .",
    "[ sec : body2 ] .    summarizing , we stress that the excitation gap is generated in nodal superconducting states by the paramagnetic effect , even when the gap nodes coincide with the zeros of the @xmath15 vector . however , the gap is closed at the topological phase boundary determined by eq .  .",
    "on the basis of the results obtained in this section , we give a practical criterion for the gap - opening .",
    "nodal parity - mixed scs acquire an excitation gap unless the fs crosses the momentum where    1 .",
    "@xmath115 or 2 .",
    "@xmath116 .",
    "here we assumed @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath108 .",
    "note that the first condition includes not only the zeros of the chiral gap function @xmath117 , but also eq .   for spzs in the limit @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , we only have to care about the first condition .",
    "the second condition is hardly satisfied because it requires an accidental situation .",
    "now we conclude that 2d nodal scs are very likely to be gapped by the paramagnetic effect , contrary to naive expectations .",
    "three equations @xmath119 are hardly satisfied for two variables @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , the gapped excitation is robust unless the fs accidentally crosses the special momentum on the 2d bz .",
    "similarly , 3d scs are also likely to become gapful scs when the fs is a quasi-2d cylinder .",
    "on the other hand , 3d scs with a closed fs may have point nodes in general .",
    "the point nodes are determined by the solution of the above three equations for @xmath121 .",
    "this is intuitively understood by considering a 2d slice of the 3d bz at a certain @xmath122 , that is , an effective 2d model parametrized by @xmath122 .",
    "the effective 2d model is gapful at most @xmath122 .",
    "however , the fs may cross the gapless momentum at some @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "for this reason , 3d line - nodal scs are likely to become point - nodal scs under the magnetic field , although there may be a few exceptional cases .",
    "we will show that such point - nodal 3d scs are classified into the weyl scs .",
    "the gap - opening mechanism clarified in this section is applicable to the nodal parity - mixed scs without orbital degrees of freedom , regardless of the dimension and the symmetry of systems .",
    "an extension toward multi - orbital systems is straightforward , and the above results may be valid as long as the band splitting is larger than the spin - orbit coupling , zeeman field , and superconducting gap .    the criteria 1 . and 2",
    "are derived on the basis of an implicit assumption that the gap does not close in the intermediate region between @xmath124 , @xmath20 , @xmath5 and @xmath125 .",
    "this assumption is confirmed to be valid in the models we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] .",
    "thus , it is expected that the criteria are valid in general .",
    "anyway , we can ignore exceptional cases in most 2d scs , where the relations  , , and , are satisfied on the fs .    in closing this section , we comment on the zeeman field with @xmath126 .",
    "then , quasiparticle excitation may be gapless owing to the paramagnetic term @xmath127 [ see eqs . and ] , even when above criteria 1 . and 2 .",
    "are satisfied .",
    "the paramagnetic term shifts the energy of @xmath128 bands , and thus , the band gap between the hole band and the electron band is not suppressed in each sector @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , we may have a band gap even in the gapless scs .",
    "later we briefly comment on this case .",
    "as shown in the previous section , most of parity - mixed nodal scs may have an excitation gap under the zeeman field .",
    "such _ paramagnetically - induced gapful scs _ are candidates of strong tscs , characterized by topological invariants in the so - called topological periodic table .",
    "@xcite the bdg hamiltonian @xmath131 preserves the particle - hole symmetry , while breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "thus , the bdg hamiltonian belongs to the symmetry class d , which can be topologically nontrivial in zero , one , and two dimensions .",
    "@xcite since 0d and 1d nodal scs are thermodynamically unstable , we focus on the topological superconductivity in two dimensions which is specified by the chern number . for 3d scs , we can not define the topological invariant based on the topological periodic table .",
    "however , the topological properties of 3d systems are often characterized by effective 2d models cut from the 3d bz . for instance , weyl scs have been identified by the chern number of 2d models .",
    "@xcite because various 2d point - nodal scs and 3d line - nodal scs have been realized in strongly - correlated electron systems , the gap - opening mechanism discussed above may produce various tscs as a result of their originally nodal gap structure .    in this section ,",
    "we show the analytic expression of the chern number in 2d paramagnetically - induced gapful scs .",

    "<S> we propose a generic scenario for realizing gapful topological superconductors ( tscs ) from gapless spin - singlet superconductors ( scs ) . </S>",
    "<S> noncentrosymmetric nodal scs in two dimension are shown to be gapful under a zeeman field , as a result of the cooperation of inversion - symmetry breaking and time - reversal - symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , non-@xmath0-wave scs acquire a large excitation gap . </S>",
    "<S> such paramagnetically - induced gapful scs may be classified into tscs in the symmetry class d specified by the chern number . </S>",
    "<S> we show nontrivial chern numbers over a wide parameter range for spin - singlet scs . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of the paramagnetically - induced gapful tscs are demonstrated , including @xmath1-wave tsc , extended @xmath2-wave tsc , @xmath3-wave tsc , and @xmath4-wave tsc . </S>",
    "<S> natural extension toward three - dimensional weyl scs is also discussed . </S>"
