    "in recent years , there has been increasing interest , especially with respect to subsurface sensing applications , in the development of inversion methods that process data from highly heterogeneous sets of sensors to obtain a unified characterization of a region of space @xcite .",
    "these _ joint inversion _ techniques are motivated by the idea that a variety of modalities , each sensitive to a different set of constitutive parameters , combined with appropriate regularization to mathematically relate one set of parameters to the others , can significantly improve characterization relative to what can be achieved through the processing of individual modalities .",
    "the potential of such a joint inversion approach has been clearly demonstrated for various modality combinations , e.g. , hydrological and seismic @xcite , electromagnetic and elastic @xcite , electromagnetic and seismic @xcite , gravity and seismic @xcite , gravity and magnetic @xcite , as well as magneto - telluric , gravity and seismic data @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider a joint inversion approach based on a geometric parameterization of the problem and employing a new multi - objective optimization scheme to combine the data from disparate sensor types .",
    "while the method is general , we are specifically concerned with exploring its performance in the context of an environmental remediation problem , namely the characterization of a subsurface contaminant source zone based on both geophysical and hydrological data .",
    "this work is motivated by the problem of remediating sites contaminated by dense non - aqueous phase liquids ( dnapls ) , such as chlorinated solvents including trichloroethylene ( tce ) or tetrachloroethylene ( pce ) , which are used in dry cleaning , degreasing operations , and gas production .",
    "successful treatment and management of source zones contaminated by such compounds typically is predicated on knowledge of the mass distribution of the dnapls in the subsurface .    partitioning tracer tests ( ptts ) are among the most developed methods for dnapl source zone characterization @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "boreholes are used to inject and extract tracer fluids .",
    "based on the physics of the problem and a knowledge of observed tracer concentration data in the extraction well ( and sometimes in boreholes along the flow path ) , an inverse problem is solved to characterize the source zone .",
    "there are a number of drawbacks with ptts .",
    "for example , this technique only provides spatially averaged estimates of dnapl saturation over flow paths defined by the typically sparse distribution of injection and pumping or observation wells @xcite .",
    "its reliance on the use of boreholes not only may fail to provide full coverage of the affected zone but also increases the risk of mobilizing the dnapl mass , if observation points within the contaminated zone are employed .",
    "partitioning tracer tomography @xcite is a more recent technique which attempts to address the shortcoming of ptt by considering the full transport model and characterizing the architecture through a rigorous stochastic inversion .",
    "however , this method still suffers from the coverage and mobilization risks of ptt .",
    "in addition to these hydrological methods , geophysical modalities including seismic methods @xcite , ground penetrating radar ( gpr ) @xcite , and electrical impedance / resistance tomography ( eit / ert ) @xcite have also received recent attention as potential tools for dnapl characterization . less invasive than hydrologic modalities , the utility of these methods for the dnapl problem arises from the contrast in electrical or seismic properties of the contaminant relative to the nominal subsurface @xcite . even with these methods ,",
    "data tend to be collected sparsely and one must still solve a challenging inverse problem to develop an image of the subsurface . as is typically the case , the need for regularization tends to result in images with rather coarse spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "joint inversion techniques may hold promise in overcoming the challenges discussed in the preceding paragraphs . indeed , a substantial literature has developed exploring joint inversion techniques for a variety of related subsurface characterization problems .",
    "for example , in @xcite two - dimensional ert is performed over various ground transects to provide estimates of the structure and water content of the subsurface .",
    "these images were then interpreted with respect to hydrological investigations of the same basin using both tracer methods and groundwater level observations .",
    "researchers have also investigated coupled inversions based on electrical resistance tomography data and hydrological models ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . in these techniques",
    ", inversion is performed simultaneously by combining the data sets and forming a joint model , instead of constraining the hydrological interpretations via the electrical tomography results or vice versa .",
    "a joint inversion over these types of data sets significantly improves the estimation and reduces the uncertainty encountered with uncoupled techniques .",
    "similarly , gpr data have been used along with hydrological data to perform a coupled inversion to identify soil structure @xcite . in the latter study ,",
    "the uniqueness and stability of the inversion process was also analyzed numerically .",
    "although significant strides have been made , the majority of the joint inversion techniques presented in the literature for subsurface characterization have been for limited scenarios ( e.g. 2d problems ) or simplified physical models @xcite .",
    "thus , joint inversion techniques that can address large scale , complex , fully three - dimensional physical domains are highly desirable .",
    "inspired by the idea in @xcite , in this work , we propose a multi - objective optimization formulation for a fully three dimensional joint inversion problem addressing dnapl source zone characterization .",
    "the dnapl problem is one example of a much broader class of inverse problems whose primary objective is the identification of a region of interest ( source zone , tumor , crack in a material sample , etc . )",
    "embedded in an inhomogeneous background . for such problems",
    "shape - based methods , such as active contours and level sets , have received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "level sets are employed in various applications including geophysical and hydrologic inverse problems @xcite . despite their broad applicability ,",
    "our prior work in this area has demonstrated that in the case of ill - posed problems ( such as the one of concern in this paper ) , traditional level set methods require delicate regularization to perform well @xcite .",
    "the method presented herein employs a new parameterization for joint inverse methods , which is an extension of the alternative parametric level set ( pals ) approach , originally developed in the context of single - modality inverse methods @xcite . in this work",
    "we also extend this approach to employ a pair of pals functions to allow for the identification of both high and low saturation regions in the source zone , known as _",
    "pools _ and _",
    "ganglia_.    the dnapl source zone characterization problem addressed here encompasses the hydro - geophysical inversion problem illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the hydrologic measurements for this problem correspond to the observations of contaminant concentration collected on a plane ( transect ) orthogonal to the nominal direction of groundwater flow and located down gradient of the source zone . electrical resistance tomography ( ert )",
    "data are also collected orthogonal to the flow direction but across planes that intersect the source zone .",
    "the specific form of this problem is motivated by a number of factors .",
    "first , the down - gradient transect concentration data are readily available in practice and unlike ptt data , their acquisition does not risk any additional mobilization of the contaminant . in terms of the geophysical modality ,",
    "our choice of ert was driven by the fact that there is some contrast between water and dnapl resistance as well as the ease of modeling this modality relative to gpr or seismic data . while gpr may provide a more robust signature than ert for dnapl in the field @xcite , a rigorous",
    ", physics based inversion of radar data using the full maxwell s equations is a daunting task .",
    "ert on the other hand requires only the solution of poisson s equation , which is computationally far more tractable .",
    "a preliminary result associated with the problem posed in this paper is reported in our recent review @xcite ; however the material here represents a substantial advance over that work . in @xcite",
    "a pals- based approach was used to characterize a simple source zone structure whose saturation profile was quite close to uniform .",
    "moreover the average saturation value was considered known a priori so that only the geometry of the source zone was to be reconstructed .",
    "we also assumed perfect knowledge of the hydraulic permeability field . as a result , a straightforward scalarized optimization formulation performed adequately . in lifting the simplifying assumptions",
    "cited above to handle more realistic scenarios , we found that a scalarization approach was no longer applicable , thereby leading to the development of the multi - objective ideas presented here . additionally , the use of multiple level set functions to identify both pool and ganglia is entirely new to this paper . in short ,",
    "the work in this paper presents a fundamentally new variational approach to joint inversion .",
    "it extends the pals ideas , and demonstrates the overall performance of these concepts on a far more challenging form of the dnapl source zone characterization problem than was considered in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides a general formulation of the problem , discussing the electrical and hydrologic models and their relationship to source zone physical properties .",
    "section 3 provides a brief overview of inversion techniques and presents the pals representation and the proposed multi- objective minimization method .",
    "section 4 discusses implementation of the method and presents and discusses some illustrative simulation results .",
    "finally , section 5 provides some general conclusions and implications .",
    "as we discussed in section [ sec1 ] , to address source zone characterization , we consider a combination of hydrologic and geophysical measurements as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the ultimate goal of this characterization effort is to extract useful information about the source zone geometry and the underlying saturation map . in the sequel we provide a brief description of each modality and ultimately link them to the proposed joint inversion and shape - based characterization techniques .",
    "simulation of dnapl infiltration and subsequent mass dissolution in the saturated zone requires the solution of both phase and component mass balance equations .",
    "the phase mass balance equations are of the form @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the intrinsic mass density of the @xmath3-phase , @xmath4 is the matrix porosity , @xmath5 is the saturation , @xmath6 is the @xmath3-phase seepage velocity vector , @xmath7 is the @xmath3-phase pore velocity vector , @xmath8 is the intrinsic permeability tensor of the medium , @xmath9 is the relative permeability , @xmath10 is the fluid phase dynamic viscosity , @xmath11 is the phase pressure , @xmath12 is the gravity vector , and @xmath13 is a mass exchange term , representing the increase in @xmath3-phase mass due to the interphase transfer of component @xmath14 from the @xmath15 phase to the @xmath3 phase .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq1 ] ) accounts for the accumulation of mass , the second term represents the change in mass due to the advective flux , and the right hand side represents the net change in @xmath3-phase mass due to interphase mass transfer of all constituents @xmath14 to and from the phase .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) neglects intra - phase compositional transformations , e.g. , chemical reactions that take place within each phase , and for slightly soluble compounds ( such as dnapls ) , the right hand side typically has negligible influence on the bulk phase flow .    equation ( [ eq1b ] ) , which quantifies @xmath6 , is a constitutive equation commonly known as the modified darcy law .",
    "other constitutive equations that relate saturation and relative permeability to the pressure differential between the fluid phases ( capillary pressure , @xmath16 ) are required to close the phase mass balance equation system .",
    "the @xmath16-@xmath5-@xmath9 relationships implemented in this work combine the brooks - corey @xcite @xmath16-@xmath5 model with the burdine @xmath9-model @xcite , integrated into a model developed by parker and lenhard @xcite to account for entrapment hysteresis ( see @xcite for a complete presentation of the hysteretic model equations ) .    within each bulk fluid phase",
    ", the spatial - temporal distribution of a component @xmath14 is described by a component mass balance equation written in terms of the mass concentration of component @xmath14 in the @xmath3-phase ( @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the three - dimensional hydrodynamic dispersion tensor for component @xmath14 in phase @xmath3 @xcite . in this work , the interphase mass exchange of component @xmath14 from the @xmath15-phase to the @xmath3-phase ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) is represented using a linear driving force expression @xcite , where interphase transfer ( dissolution ) is controlled by diffusion across a thin ( stagnant ) aqueous boundary layer that surrounds the entrapped dnapl phase .",
    "the mass exchange is assumed proportional to the difference between component concentrations across this layer , with the proportionality coefficient ( an effective mass transfer coefficient ) determined by a mass transfer correlation expression .",
    "simulations presented in this work employed the laboratory - validated correlation for dnapl dissolution presented in @xcite .    for the applications presented here ,",
    "only two fluid phases are modeled , the aqueous phase ( @xmath20 ) and the dnapl ( @xmath21 ) , which requires that @xmath22 . because the focus of this study is on the dnapl mass , sorption to the solid phase",
    "is neglected and no independent equation is written for the solid phase .",
    "representative dnapl source zone saturation distributions were developed by solving a coupled system of equations of the form ( [ eq1 ] ) for fluid phase pressures , to describe dnapl infiltration and redistribution . for the plume transport simulations used in the inversion , the redistributed dnapl is assumed immobile and composed of a single component ( i.e. , @xmath14 indexing is not needed ) .",
    "thus , solution of only a single ( aqueous ) flow equation is required and this is coupled to a single transport equation of the form ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "given that sorption has been neglected , dissolution is the only interphase mass transfer process considered .",
    "the ert model is based on introduction of electrical current into a medium and measuring the electrical potential at the periphery of the medium to analyze how the electrical conductivity is distributed throughout the medium . the underlying partial differential equation which relates the potential , @xmath23 , to the conductivity @xmath24 and",
    "the electric current distribution @xmath25 is @xmath26 with the boundary conditions @xmath27 in ( [ eq4 ] ) , @xmath28 is the surface normal and @xmath29 is a no - current boundary corresponding to the air - soil interface modeled using a neumann boundary condition . over @xmath30 an infinite half space",
    "is approximated using a mixed boundary condition by appropriately choosing the function @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of current is usually represented as point source dipoles of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dirac delta function , @xmath34 is a dc current and @xmath35 are the current electrode coordinates . to obtain a full data set , multiple experiments are performed with different electrodes acting as current sources .",
    "petro - physical relationships link @xmath24 , the conductivity distribution measure of the domain , and in this case , the saturation of the dnapl , @xmath36 ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) .",
    "the most widely used petro - physical model is the archie s law @xcite , which for this two phase aqueous- dnapl system takes the form @xmath38 here @xmath39 is electrical conductivity of the aqueous phase , @xmath4 is the porosity of the medium , @xmath40 is a fitting parameter , @xmath41 is a fitting parameter that commonly referred to as the cementation index , and @xmath42 is the saturation index . at large saturations of an electrically conductive aqueous phase , the value of the saturation index can be approximated as 2.0 @xcite .",
    "archie s law assumes that the solid and dnapl do not contribute to the electrical conductivity .",
    "hunt in @xcite provided theoretical justification for the form of this model using continuum percolation theory . in this paper",
    "we use archie s law , although the inversion approach developed is not specific to the selected petro - physical model .",
    "the goal of most inverse problems is to extract information about a physical property in space , @xmath43 , using data that are linked to @xmath44 via a physical model .",
    "consider @xmath45 as the computational model that maps @xmath44 to the data vector @xmath46 .",
    "for simplicity we start with a single modality and later extend the notion to more than one model .",
    "a straightforward strategy to obtain an estimate @xmath47 of @xmath44 is to minimize model - data mismatch in a variational sense : @xmath48 where for a vector @xmath49 and a symmetric positive definite matrix @xmath50 @xmath51 the matrix @xmath50 usually contains the noise statistics and a pattern for weighting the data . to perform the inversion using conventional approaches ,",
    "@xmath44 is discretized over a dense grid of pixels in the region of interest and the minimization is carried out to find the corresponding pixel values .",
    "given the practical limitations in acquiring dense , rich sets of data , many problems of this kind are ill - posed and require regularization .",
    "well known regularizations typically take the form of added penalties to the inversion cost function to control the amplitude and smoothness of the of reconstruction @xcite .",
    "shape - based methods are another class of techniques that are capable of better posing the problem . a shape - based approach proceeds by partitioning the domain of interest into a number of zones defined by similar property values .",
    "the inverse problem then amounts to determining the boundaries of each of the zones , along with a ( generally low - order ) representation for the spatial distribution of the property in each zone .",
    "this technique specifically suits inverse problems where the main objective is the characterization of an inclusion within a background domain .",
    "the most well known shape - based technique is the level set method @xcite , in which the shape boundaries are represented via the zero level set of a higher dimensional surface .",
    "consider the basic binary case in which the domain of interest , @xmath52 , is composed of two regions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 in @xmath53 and @xmath56 in @xmath54 .",
    "for a shape - based representation , one can characterize both zones using a level set function @xmath57 , such that @xmath58 and accordingly rewrite the property of interest in terms of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 as @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents the heaviside step function .",
    "the scalar anomaly coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 may in general be functions of @xmath64 , representing some low order representation of the anomaly texture in each zone ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the binary case discussed above can be generalized to multiple regions by using more than one level set function ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "minimization of ( [ eq7 ] ) for a level - set based property model of the form ( [ eq10 ] ) is performed in an evolutionary fashion .",
    "starting with some initial level set function @xmath65 , the function evolves to attain a state such that its zero level set best describes the true shape .",
    "the resulting time - discretized hamilton - jacobi type of evolution equation takes the form @xmath66 and is initialized as @xmath67 . in this equation @xmath68",
    "represents the artificial time in the evolutionary process , @xmath69 is the corresponding time increment and @xmath70 is a normal speed function ( shown in figure [ fig2 ] ) . at every iteration , the speed function",
    "is calculated based upon the sensitivity of the cost function to the current shape state @xcite . as illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] , one attractive feature of the level set technique is its topological flexibility , which allows for the identification of disjoint objects without the need to know a priori the number of components @xcite .",
    "@xmath71{fig2a } \\includegraphics[width=16pc]{fig2b } \\end{array}$ ]    despite the positive features , there are usually additional complexities associated with implementation of level sets , especially for inverse problems @xcite . to guarantee proper convergence , the level set function should retain a certain form ( usually a signed distance function ) .",
    "also , since the acquired speed function only applies to the zero level set of @xmath59 , speed extension methods to globally deform the level set function need to be applied @xcite . moreover , from a numerical perspective , a level set function is still represented in terms of discrete grid values ( pixels ) which potentially increases the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "such dimensionality can again cause problems in tackling ill - posed inverse problems and pose the challenge of applying traditional or geometric regularizations @xcite .    to remedy the problems associated with applying level set techniques to ill - posed inverse problems and yet take advantage of their topological flexibility , recent work by aghasi _",
    "_ @xcite proposes using a parametric level set ( pals ) function . in the pals technique ,",
    "the level set function is parameterized in terms of a parameter vector @xmath72 $ ] , with @xmath73 much less than the number of pixels involved in the discrete representation of the problem .",
    "its deformations are controlled by changing the elements of @xmath74 .",
    "this type of parameterization thereby induces a form of regularization by parameterization ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors also present a _ pseudo - logical _ approach , which approximately models applying set operations on simple geometries to form more complex structures . more specifically ,",
    "considering @xmath75 to be a compactly supported radial basis function ( simply called a bump ) they propose a pals form as @xmath76 where the constant @xmath77 is a positive scalar close to zero , @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the parameter vector controlling weights , radii , and centers of the bumps .",
    "note that @xmath77 is required to obtain nontrivial results as the radial basis functions are themselves exactly zero after a certain radius .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig3 ] , this model exhibits a pseudo - logical behavior .",
    "for example , the sum of two positive bumps having comparable size ( shown in the top panel of figure [ fig3 ] as the orange surface ) approximates the union operation on their zero level sets ( grey shapes in the bottom black plane of the figure ) .",
    "similarly , summation of a positive and a relatively large negative bump can approximate the set exclusion operator ( figure [ fig3 ] , bottom ) . using this concept , the basic algebraic summation in ( [ eq12 ] )",
    "can imply set operations on the support of the bumps and make the level set function capable of expressing a large class of geometries .",
    "@xmath71{fig3a } \\includegraphics[width=16pc]{fig3b } \\end{array}$ ]    by using @xmath80 in ( [ eq10 ] ) and employing a smooth version of the heaviside function ( as discussed more fully in @xcite ) , the large - scale minimization problem in ( [ eq7 ] ) reduces to a minimization over the pals parameters and the texture parameters , @xmath60 and @xmath61 in ( [ eq10 ] ) as @xmath81    the number of unknown parameters in ( [ eq13 ] ) tends to be much smaller than those in pixel based and conventional level set methods .",
    "the low dimensionality of the pals approach makes the inverse problem less ill - posed without sacrificing much in terms of flexibility in shape representation .",
    "moreover , it establishes a foundation that supports using quadratic minimization techniques such as the newton methods .",
    "these methods are faster than gradient descent techniques and robust against the scaling of different variables appearing in the minimization @xcite .",
    "in section 2 we presented two different modalities ; the hydrological and electrical models .",
    "in the hydrological inversion we are interested in reconstructing the dnapl saturation values based on the measurements of the contaminant concentration in a down gradient transect .",
    "on the other hand , in the ert inversion we seek to extract the electric conductivity of the domain given a limited number of potential measurements . using a petro - physical model ,",
    "the problem can be expressed entirely in terms of saturation and inversion can be cast as the solution to the multi - objective optimization problem @xmath82         \\frac{1}{2 } \\big \\| \\boldsymbol{d}_{\\mathpzc{e}}- \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{m}}_{\\mathpzc{e}}\\big(p(s_n)\\big)\\big \\|_{\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\mathpzc{e}}}^2       \\end{array}\\ ,     \\right.\\ ] ] where indices @xmath83 and @xmath84 correspond to the hydrological and electrical modalities , and @xmath85 represents the petro - physical relationship that links saturation and conductivity ( here , the archie s law ) .",
    "a generalization for the notion of optimality in multi - objective minimization is the _ pareto optimality _ @xcite . for multiple costs @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , a vector @xmath88 is called pareto optimal , if there exist no @xmath89 such that @xmath90 for @xmath87 with a strict inequality for at least one @xmath91 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath92 is called _ locally pareto optimal _ if there exists a neighborhood of @xmath92 in which @xmath92 is pareto optimal .    for the problem of interest here , using a pals shape - based approach as in ( [ eq13 ] ) , @xmath93 can be parameterized as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a vector containing the pals and texture parameters . in this case",
    "the inverse problem amounts to finding a locally pareto optimal point for the multi - objective minimization problem @xmath96 where @xmath97    one of the main solution strategies in multi - objective optimization is the scalarization approach , for which a single objective function is obtained as a linear combination of the underlying costs . for our case ,",
    "a scalarized version of the multi - objective problem would be @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are fixed at the beginning of the minimization to roughly make the two cost terms comparable .",
    "in addition to the general problem of balancing the terms , scalarization is not always an efficient approach for multi - objective problems ( e.g. , see section 7 in @xcite ) . in employing gradient - based techniques to iteratively minimize ( [ eq18 ] ) , there is no guarantee that a descent direction based on @xmath101 simultaneously reduces @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , the balance between the two terms may change substantially , as the iterations progress , thereby , yielding a solution that in a sense does not maximally exploit all of the information in the various data sources .    for the particular problem of interest here such behavior",
    "is in fact observed .",
    "specifically , dnapl saturation values may increase without subsequent change to the down gradient contaminant concentration , as concentrations along a given flow path approach the aqueous solubility .",
    "this phenomenon is better demonstrated in figure [ fig3p5](a ) . specifically in this demonstration , for a fixed volume of dnapl ( here a cube of uniform saturation @xmath104 ) , we measure @xmath105 , the quasi - steady state downstream concentration of a single point for different values of @xmath104 .",
    "we also have an electric potential measurement , @xmath106 , corresponding to a fixed source of current .",
    "typical plots of @xmath105 and @xmath107 in terms of @xmath104 are shown in figures [ fig3p5](b ) and [ fig3p5](c ) .",
    "technically speaking , once the aqueous solubility of water is reached , for a wide range of saturation values , @xmath105 stays almost constant would result @xmath105 to start stepping below @xmath108 .",
    "this reduction is due to the fact that as @xmath104 increases , the permeability to the water phase decreases . at high values of @xmath104 ,",
    "the water does not flow to any appreciable extent through the contaminated zone and will start to flow around it , which decreases the rate of dissolution .",
    "as this second phenomenon only happens at very large saturations , we only emphasized on the first phenomenon . ]",
    "close to a threshold @xmath108 . for the electrical measurement",
    ", according to the archie s law and the poisson s equation , increasing @xmath104 causes an overall reduction in the electrical conductivity of the domain which causes a monotonic increase in @xmath107 as depicted in figure [ fig3p5](c ) .",
    "+    this simple experiment reveals that the two physical models would not in general maintain a balanced sensitivity to the saturation values in a course of reconstruction . in these circumstances",
    "the scalarized cost function effectively ignores one data set due to larger decreases that can be obtained by `` listening to '' the other data .",
    "while a heuristic way of approaching this problem is iteratively rebalancing the cost terms , a proper convergence may not be guaranteed for such an approach . furthermore , rebalancing the cost terms does not necessarily balance the corresponding sensitivities and still one of the costs may be neglected in determining a descent direction .",
    "inspired by the idea presented in @xcite , in the sequel we present an iterative scheme that the step determined in the course of reconstruction would simultaneously reduce both misfit terms .",
    "classic newton techniques provide an iterative procedure to converge to a stationary point . more specifically , for a given cost @xmath109 , initializing the process with @xmath110 , at the @xmath111-th iteration a suitable scalar multiple of a descent direction @xmath112 is added to the current estimate @xmath113 to generate the subsequent estimate . to determine the descent direction , a quadratic taylor approximation is considered as @xmath114 and to reduce the cost to the maximum extent , @xmath112 is obtained by minimizing @xmath115 , i.e. ,",

    "figure [ fig4 ] illustrates how a direction acquired by minimizing @xmath123 is the optimal direction to simultaneously reduce both costs @xmath124 .",

    "the dimensionality reduction that pals brings into the problem makes taking the @xmath112 steps in ( [ eq20 ] ) tractable and obtain a direction that simultaneously reduces both cost terms .",
    "one of the main limiting assumptions of the multi - objective newton technique in @xcite is the positivity of the hessians , which does not necessarily hold for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "this parameter is closely related to how successfully the reconstructed texture parameter captures the inhomogeneity of the shape .",
    "based upon this metric , the joint inversion presented in figure [ fig6](c ) is characterized by 5.5@xmath156 error in the relative mass . to provide a more detailed picture of the reconstruction , in figure [ fig6 - 2](a )",
    "we have shown a transect of the saturation distribution and the corresponding reconstruction contour .",
    "in contrast to mont , reconstruction based upon the scalarization approach for joint inversion results in 8.1@xmath156 relative mass error and a rather poor reconstruction as shown in figure [ fig6](d ) and figure [ fig6 - 2](b ) .",
    "it is worth noting that considering different weights for the hydrologic and electrical misfit terms does not improve the results and this is mainly due to the thresholding phenomenon associated with the hydrologic model .",
    "in fact , the success of the scalarization approach in providing an acceptable mass error is thanks to the update of the texture parameter , @xmath157 , based almost entirely on the ert modality .",
    "the reconstruction shown in figure [ fig6](c ) is based upon the joint inversion of both electrical and hydrologic data .",
    "thus , it is important to understand what each data set can provide when independently inverted .",
    "reconstruction based on inverting only the ert data is shown in figures [ fig6](e ) and [ fig6 - 2](c ) .",

    "reconstruction based on inverting only the concentration data is shown in figures [ fig6](f ) and [ fig6 - 2](d ) ( 76.4@xmath156 relative mass error ) .",
    "the electrical - only reconstruction limits mass errors at the expense of shape matching ( note the bulkier shape in figure [ fig6](e ) and the loose contour in figure [ fig6 - 2](d ) ) .",
    "in contrast , inversion based only on hydrologic data appears to be poor in both relative mass errors and shape matching .",
    "this is mainly due to the severe ill - posedness of the hydraulic model originating in the thresholding effect of aqueous solubility .    the iterative cost reductions for both the scalarized and mont algorithms are shown in figure [ fig6 - 2](e ) .",
    "both methods are initialized in identical states . in using a scalarization approach , the balance between the costs quickly changes and at every iteration the reduction of one cost term",
    "might be at the expense of increasing the other .",
    "the scalarization approach converges in about 45 iterations , but ends in a local minimum that is highly affected by the hydrologic model ( compare figures [ fig6](d ) and [ fig6](f ) ) . in using the mont approach both individual cost terms monotonically",
    "decrease at every iteration . with the mont approach ,",
    "descent directions are determined based on the constrained problem ( [ eq23 ] ) and the number of iterations before reaching a steady state is about 75 iterations .",
    "it is important to note that considering a constant hydraulic conductivity brings some level of uncertainty into the inversion model .",
    "besides this , there is an added uncertainty associated with the thresholding effect of the hydrological model and the inaccuracy in the data .",
    "based on these three sources of uncertainty , full matching of the hydrologic model with the data does not necessarily result in successful reconstructions ( revisit figure [ fig6](f ) ) . as observable in figure [ fig6 - 2](e ) , in using the scalarization approach , the ultimate cost value for the hydrologic model is less than that of mont , originating from the dominance of the hydrologic cost in the inversion process .",
    "this dominance causes an early trapping in a local minimum .",
    "however , in case of mont , roughly speaking , thanks to the mutual control that cost functions have over each other , only the `` useful '' portion of the hydrologic data is employed and by avoiding a full hydrologic data - model matching , an early local minimum is prevented . in this case",
    "the ert cost value shows to be less than that of the scalarization approach and a more reliable iterative process is achieved .      in the previous example a single level set function",
    "was used to reconstruct a shape representing the average dnapl profile .",
    "when characterization efforts seek to distinguish areas of high saturation , a second pals function can be added to create a texture function ( rather than a texture parameter as described above ) .",
    "a more general form of ( [ eq24 ] ) is @xmath158 the main difference between ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) is in the nature of @xmath157 . in ( [ eq24 ] ) , @xmath157 is only a scalar while in ( [ eq26 ] ) , @xmath159 is a texture function defined within the source zone .",
    "this texture function is used to classify the source zone texture into low and high saturation values .",
    "more specifically we represent the texture as @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are scalar values representing average saturation values for the pools and ganglia . plugging ( [ eq26 ] ) into ( [ eq27 ] ) yields @xmath163 in this representation the level set function @xmath146 characterizes the regions inside and outside the source zone . within the source zone , the function @xmath147 characterizes the ganglia and the pools .",
    "therefore this representation is capable of classifying regions as : zero saturation , low saturation or high saturation . here rather than estimating @xmath161 and @xmath162 , for simplicity we use fixed values with @xmath1640.01 to define the extent of contamination and @xmath1650.15 to then extract the regions containing pooled dnapl .",
    "these values are arbitrary , but consistent with our prior work in defining ganglia and pools @xcite .",
    "alternative values can be assigned to these two parameters , and the inversion will produce the corresponding iso - surfaces .",

    "initial centers are chosen randomly amongst those associated with @xmath146 , and the dilation factor is selected to be @xmath154 to result in smaller initial geometries for the pools .",
    "the overall initialization is shown in figure [ fig8](b ) where the green iso - surface corresponds to the initial ganglia and the brown surface represents the initial pools .",
    "visual comparison of the joint inversion results ( figure [ fig8](c ) ) with the original saturation profile ( figure [ fig8](a ) ) suggests that the features corresponding to ganglia and pools are well reconstructed .",
    "the error in recovering the total mass for this reconstruction was 7.8@xmath156 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in this case at least , use of the two level sets actually decreases overall performance of the joint inversion .",
    "thus , the benefits of delineating the high saturation regions come at the expense of some accuracy .",
    "a transect of the source zone along with the underlying contours are shown in figure [ fig10](a ) .",
    "it can be observed that besides the good performance in characterizing the source zone , the pool contours are more or less accumulated around the denser pooling sites .",
    "the pools in this release are very sporadic and distributed all around the source zone .",
    "to more clearly illustrate the performance of the method in characterizing the pools , a second source zone architecture ( figure [ fig9](a ) ) was created by simulating the release of a pce - dnapl within a different permeability field ( not shown ) .",
    "for this example although still sporadic , most pooling sites are close to the ground surface .",
    "initial pals parameters are the same as in the previous example ( table [ tab2 ] ) though the initialization ( figure [ fig9](b ) ) employed a new set of random centers .",
    "the resulting source zone reconstruction is shown in figure [ fig9](c ) .",
    "besides the successful reconstruction of the ganglia structure , this example more clearly shows the accumulation of reconstructed pools close to the surface where the actual pools are located . despite the random initialization of the pool locations , in the course of inversion they are gradually pushed towards the actual locations . the error in recovering the total mass for this example was 2.5@xmath156 and the reconstruction was performed in 32 iterations . as before ,",
    "a 2d transect of the saturation and the reconstruction contours are presented in figure [ fig10](b ) , that help showing the appearance of the pools contour close to the actual pooling sites .",
    "this paper basically provides a geometric approach to joint inversion . while a specific application was considered herein , the formulation and strategy in solving the inversion in a joint form is general .",
    "in fact , the joint inversion approach that is presented in this work can be adopted by other disciplines to combine various physical modalities .",
    "this is particularly important as many joint inversion techniques simply suggest using a scalarization approach for physically incompatible models .",
    "application of the proposed technique to the dnapl characterization problem produces reasonable reconstructions of the source zone structure based on the fusion of electrical and hydraulic sensors . using this technique we are able to reconstruct a detailed picture of the source zone along with useful information about its texture and the high saturation regions .",
    "in fact , our results suggest how hydrology information can be used in a controlled way to `` help '' improving the geophysical reconstructions .",
    "although application of geophysical techniques to 3d problems can be found in the literature , use of a fully 3d , multiphase flow and transport model within an inversion routine has not previously been demonstrated , due in large part to the computational burden and ill - posedness associated with the use of such a model . in the context of joint inversion ,",
    "the problem becomes even more complex , since appropriately combining the modalities and making use of different data sets significantly exacerbates the problem .",
    "our ability to employ 3d models is directly linked to the low - order nature of the pals and still its high flexibility in shape representation .",
    "thanks to this low - order representation , applying the mont technique becomes computationally tractable and a controlled inversion over incompatible data sets becomes possible .",
    "the presented work is in fact a proof of concept to what can be done in the future . as stated before",
    ", a future work would be exploring other geophysical modalities , such as gpr , which are capable of providing a higher contrast at the expense of computational complexity .",
    "moreover , to reduce the hydrologic model uncertainties , methods of estimating the hydraulic permeability prior to ( or in line with ) the inversion may be considered .",
    "ultimately , the successful performance of the method in the challenging and rather realistic examples considered , makes it a reasonable technology to be tested with real field data .",
