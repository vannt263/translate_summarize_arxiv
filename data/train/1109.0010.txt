    "dark matter halos contain baryons in the forms of stars and gas , but there is active debate about the level of agreement between the baryon fraction in halos and the cosmic mean , @xmath15 , as well as which baryonic phase dominates as a function of halo mass @xmath16 .",
    "cosmological simulations suggest that the baryon content of massive galaxy clusters ( m@xmath17 m@xmath8 ) should be within 10% of the universal value ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in galaxy clusters ,",
    "most baryons reside in the hot , diffuse , x - ray emitting intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "detailed x - ray measurements suggest that the hot gas fraction ( @xmath13 ) is considerably lower than the cosmic value in the inner regions of clusters ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) though recent measurements suggest that @xmath13 might approach the universal value at larger radii @xcite .    depleted",
    "gas mass fractions at small radii might indicate that the icm has been affected by non gravitational processes such as star formation or feedback from active galatic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "indeed , sources of heat such as these that are located near the centers of clusters might pump thermal energy into the icm causing it to expand towards the outskirts ( thus lowering @xmath13 in cluster cores ) .",
    "significant sources of heat might even be capable of removing gas from lower - mass halos @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that @xmath13 is lower than expected at small radii might also simply indicate that some gas has been transformed into other baryonic components such as galaxy stellar mass or intra - cluster light ( icl ) .",
    "discriminating between these two scenarios is key towards understanding the efficiency of processes that regulate star formation and for tracing the thermo - dynamic history of icl .",
    "galaxy groups are highly interesting in this respect since they have shallower potential wells than clusters and should therefore be more sensitive to non - gravitational processes ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "measurements of the baryon fraction at group scales , however , are disparate and subject to much debate ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , one unresolved issue is whether or not the baryon content of galaxy groups is dominated by hot gas ( like clusters ) or if other baryonic phases such as galaxy stellar mass or icl also make a significant contribution . from x - ray studies",
    "there is a fairly clear consensus that @xmath13 decreases towards lower halo masses ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the two other components , @xmath0 and @xmath18 , have proved more challenging to measure and are largely responsible for disagreements in the literature regarding the group scale baryon fraction .",
    "the icl component is diffuse and faint ( with a typical surface brightness of 27 - 32 mag arcsec@xmath19 in the r - band ) and therefore extremely difficult to measure ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0 component is subject to uncertainties regarding the assignment of galaxies to groups and clusters , but also to uncertainties inherent to stellar mass measurements themselves .",
    "previous results on this topic can be broadly divided into two categories . in the first category ,",
    "the decrease in @xmath13 towards lower halo masses is found to be exactly compensated by an increased contribution from @xmath0+@xmath18 in such a way that the baryon fraction is constant with halo mass and is found to be either slightly below @xcite or significantly below @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this would imply that there is a simple trade - off between @xmath13 and @xmath0+@xmath18 from group to cluster scales . in the second category , @xmath0+@xmath18 do not exactly compensate for the decrease of @xmath13 at group scales and thus the baryon fraction is found to be mildly decreasing towards lower halo masses ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this could imply for example that the icm is more strongly affected by feedback mechanisms in groups than in clusters .",
    "most of the work to date has not directly probed @xmath0 , but has focused instead on the relationship between halo mass and the total k - band luminosity of group and cluster galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although k - band luminosity is most sensitive to the low - mass stars that dominate the total mass of most stellar populations , it is not a direct tracer of this mass .",
    "other work , for lack of multiband photometry , has estimated @xmath0 using simple mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) estimates ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    ", however , mass - to - light ratio values can vary strongly with galaxy color , metallicity , and age .",
    "no single mass - to - light ratio can capture the complexity of the full galaxy population @xcite .",
    "no studies to date have actually accounted for the full morphological mix of galaxies in group environments and used spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting methods to derived @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we measure @xmath0 using stellar masses derived from full sed fitting to multi - band photometry ( including k - band ) from the cosmos survey .",
    "we tackle the issue of measuring @xmath0 using two complementary approaches .",
    "first , we use a halo occupation distribution ( hod ) model that has been calibrated to fit measurements of galaxy clustering , galaxy - galaxy lensing , and the galaxy smf as a function of redshift . using this method",
    "we can derive @xmath0 down to much lower halo masses ( a few @xmath21 m@xmath22 ) than possible using group and cluster catalogs .",
    "second , we use a group membership catalog to directly calculate @xmath0 for @xmath23 by summing together the stellar masses of group members .",
    "interestingly , we find results that are significantly different than previous work . assuming a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) , our results suggest that previously published estimates of @xmath0 on group scales are overestimated by a factor of about 2 to 5 .",
    "the discrepancy is only partially reduced by assuming a salpeter imf .",
    "we investigate the cause of this discrepancy and find that previous work has overestimated @xmath0 due to a combination of inaccurate stellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies in groups and clusters are passive early type galaxies with a constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "the data are briefly described in section [ cosmos_survey ] followed by the presentation of our method used to derive @xmath0 in section [ section_method ] .",
    "our main results are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and draw up our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",

    "stellar mass estimates are therefore an important component of this paper .",

    "groups in this catalog have halo masses that span the range @xmath56 .    to estimate @xmath0 from this group catalog ,",
    "we need a method to distinguish galaxies that belong to groups from those in the field . for this",
    "we use the group membership probability catalog from ge11 . in ge11 , the full probability distribution function ( pdf ) from the cosmos",

    "a detailed description of this model can be found in @xcite . in particular , as described in section 2.3 of that paper , this model can be used to derive @xmath0 as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this approach as the `` hod method '' .",
    "this method is discussed in more detail in section [ hod_method ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive @xmath0 as a function of @xmath60 . to achieve this goal , we use two different and complementary measurements .",
    "first , we use a hod model that has been calibrated to fit measurements of galaxy clustering , galaxy - galaxy lensing , and the galaxy smf as a function of redshift .",
    "second , we use a group membership catalog to directly calculate @xmath0 by summing together the stellar masses of group members .",
    "there are advantages and disadvantages inherent to each method .",
    "the hod method might be considered to be a more indirect probe of @xmath0 , however , it allows us to derive @xmath0 over a much wider halo mass range than with group and cluster catalogs .",
    "for example , in cosmos , this technique allows us to probe @xmath0 down to the stellar mass completeness limit of the survey ( @xmath61 m@xmath8 at @xmath48 ) .",
    "the group catalog method is more direct and less prone to modeling uncertainties ( for example , the assumption that satellite galaxies follow the same radial distributions as the dark matter ) .",
    "however , this technique is limited by the halo mass range for which group and cluster catalogs can be constructed ( @xmath62 m@xmath8 ) and is subject to other uncertainties such as the accurate identification of the centers of groups and cluster of galaxies .",
    "the group catalog method is also subject to uncertainties due to the completeness and purity of the membership assignment and to projection effects , that must be understood through mock catalogs . finally , we compare both methods with the results from the abundance matching technique described in @xcite , with the assumption of the cosmos stellar mass function .",
    "this model has substantially fewer parameters but makes a specific assumption about the connection between galaxies and dark matter subhalos .",
    "the relationship between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass can be described via a statistical model of the probability distribution @xmath63 that a halo of mass @xmath16 is host to n galaxies above some threshold in luminosity or stellar - mass .",
    "this statistical model , commonly known as the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , has been considerably successful at interpreting the clustering properties of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the hod is usually inferred observationally by modeling measurements of the two - point correlation function of galaxies , @xmath64 , it can also be used to model other observables such as galaxy - galaxy lensing and the stellar - mass function . in l11 the hod model was used to probe the relationship between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "constraints were obtained by performing a joint fit to galaxy - galaxy lensing , galaxy clustering , and the galaxy stellar mass function .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the parameter fits from table 5 in l11 and we use these to study @xmath0 as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 following the procedure outlined in section 2.3 of @xcite .",
    "one potential concern with this method is that the calculation of @xmath65 might require extrapolating the hod model beyond the lower and upper stellar mass bounds for which the model has been calibrated .",
    "as shown in l11 , @xmath0 is dominated by the stellar mass of central galaxies for @xmath66 m@xmath8 .",
    "this concern is therefore only valid for halos larger than about @xmath67 m@xmath8 where satellite galaxies represent the dominant contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "we now investigate the stellar mass range of satellite galaxies that build up the bulk of @xmath65 ( the satellite contribution to @xmath0 ) in halos above @xmath68 m@xmath8 .",
    "the original hod analysis of l11 used @xmath69 halo masses ( defined with respect to 200 times the mean matter density @xmath70 ) . for simplicity , for the tests in this paragraph we will also use @xmath69 but the conclusions are also valid for @xmath1 masses .",
    "let us consider the stellar fraction for satellites in a fixed stellar mass bin , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 represents a lower stellar mass limit and @xmath73 represents an upper stellar mass limit .",
    "the expression for @xmath71 is given by :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 represents the conditional stellar mass function for satellite galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "using this expression , we have tested how @xmath76 varies with the integral limits @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we find that at fixed halo mass , the bulk of @xmath65 comes from galaxies with @xmath77 m@xmath8 .",
    "for example , for @xmath78 m@xmath8 , 95@xmath79 and 90@xmath79 of @xmath65 is due to satellites with @xmath80 m@xmath8 and @xmath81 m@xmath8 respectively .",
    "the hod model of l11 is calibrated down to @xmath82 m@xmath8 at @xmath48 and to @xmath83 m@xmath8 at @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the bulk of @xmath65 arises from satellites that are well within the tested limits of our model ( for a similar calculation , also see @xcite ) .    as mentioned previously",
    ", the l11 analysis assumes @xmath69 halo masses whereas in this paper we use @xmath1 halo masses so as to facilitate comparisons with previous work .",
    "we therefore need to convert the l11 results from @xmath69 to @xmath1 . for this",
    "we make two assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that satellites galaxies are distributed according to the same profiles as their parent halos , namely , nfw profiles @xcite with @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "second , we assume that the distribution of satellite galaxies is independent of stellar mass ( i.e , there is no `` satellite mass segregation '' ) . this assumption is supported by multiple observations @xcite but see also @xcite . under these two assumptions , @xmath65 is unchanged by any halo mass conversion ( because the same conversion factor applies to both the numerator and the denominator in @xmath65 ) .",
    "the @xmath85 component does vary , however , because the halo mass ( denominator ) changes while the mass of the central galaxy ( numerator ) remains constant . for details on how to convert halo masses assuming a nfw profile , see appendix c in @xcite . for this conversion ,",
    "we assume the mass - concentration relation of @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we describe our procedure for calculating @xmath0 at group scales using the cosmos x - ray group catalog .",
    "figure [ xgroup_bin ] shows the group sample as a function of redshift and @xmath86 .",
    "blue boxes show the binning scheme that we adopt for this paper .",
    "the redshift limits are selected to match those of l11 and are @xmath87 $ ] , @xmath88 $ ] , and @xmath89 $ ] .    to ensure a robust group sample with a relatively clean member list , we include only groups with reliable optical associations having greater than 3 members , and we exclude close neighboring systems and groups near the edges of the field or masked regions where member assignment is difficult ( catalog flags xflag=1 or 2 , and poor = merger = mask=0 ; see ge11 for flag definitions ) .",
    "this ensemble of quality cuts is synthesized by a global flag in ge11 called flag_include ( we select groups with flag_include=1 ) . in total , after these cuts , our catalog contains 129 groups at @xmath59 .",
    "the determination of group centers is an important and non - trivial task , especially since these structures do not always have a visually obvious central galaxy .",
    "mis - centering effects could lead to an underestimate of @xmath0 , especially if the mis - centering is large enough that the true central galaxy is excluded from the group selection for example .",
    "george et al . in",
    "prep show that weak lensing is an excellent tool that can be used to optimize centering algorithms by maximizing the stacked weak lensing signal at small radii ( below about 500 kpc ) .",
    "for example , george et al . in prep also show that various naive centering algorithms such as the centroid of galaxy members , even if weighted by stellar mass or luminosity , is a poor tracer of the centers of dark matter halos .",
    "we use the group centers from george et al . in prep that are found to maximize the stacked weak lensing signals at small radii , namely , the most massive group galaxy located within an nfw scale radius of the x - ray centroid , denoted mmgg@xmath90 .",
    "we note , however , that george et al . in prep",
    "have also identified a sub - set of groups ( of order 20% ) that host a more massive galaxy at a greater distance from the x - ray centroid than the nfw scale radius . for these groups ,",
    "the weak lensing does not clearly indicate a preferred center among the two options .",
    "we include these systems in our analysis but we have tested that our results are not affected by this choice .",
    "group members are selected according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "@xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the group membership probability derived in ge11 .",
    "@xmath93 where @xmath94 is the projected distance to the group center ( defined hereafter by the position of the mmgg@xmath90 ) .",
    "3 .   galaxies must have a stellar mass above the completeness limit of the bin in consideration ( see table [ bin_schem ] ) .",
    "stellar mass completeness limits for the group membership catalog are higher than those quoted in section [ stellar_masses ] , because the group membership catalog is limited to @xmath57 .",
    "group members are selected only within a radius of @xmath14 for two reasons .",
    "ge11 have shown that the purity of the group membership assignment drops at larger radii ( see their figure 5 ) . by only considering galaxies at @xmath93 ,",
    "we reduce the errors due to purity corrections . in addition , most previously published work on this topic has used @xmath93 ; this choice thus facilitates comparisons with previous work ( see  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "once group members have been selected following the criteria outlined above , @xmath0 is derived for each group as the sum of the stellar masses of all group members associated with this group divided by the halo mass .",
    "halo masses are derived from the x - ray luminosity following the weak lensing scaling relation of @xcite .",
    "although in principle more direct than the hod method , measuring @xmath0 estimates from the group catalog has systematic errors that must be corrected for .",
    "the two main effects on the measurement are :    1 .   the completeness and purity of the membership selection . here",
    "we include both contamination in the group membership selection due to neighboring galaxies but also the de - projection of a spherical nfw profile . indeed , the quantity that we are interested in is @xmath0 contained within a sphere of radius @xmath14 whereas our membership selection is akin to selecting galaxies in a cylinder in redshift space .",
    "we therefore include a correction factor for this de - projection .",
    "2 .   the stellar mass completeness of the group membership catalog ( i.e. , we need to account for the contribution to @xmath0 from galaxies below the completeness limit ) .    to derive these correction factors",
    ", we use a suite of cosmos - like mock catalogs that have been described in ge11 .",
    "mocks were created from a single simulation ( named `` consuelo '' ) 420 @xmath95 mpc on a side , resolved with 1400@xmath96 particles , and a particle mass of 1.87@xmath97 @xmath95 m@xmath8 .",
    "this simulation can robustly resolve halos with masses above @xmath98 @xmath95 m@xmath8 which corresponds to a central galaxy stellar masses of @xmath99 @xmath95 m@xmath8 , well - matched to our completeness limit of @xmath100 at low redshift .",

    "see ge11 for further details regarding these mock catalogs .",
    "we derive a single overall correction factor to @xmath0 due to the two effects described above .",

    "@xmath102 is defined as :    @xmath104    where @xmath105 represents the `` true '' total mass from the mocks in a sphere of @xmath14 and down to the completeness limit of the mocks and @xmath106 represents our group member selection applied to the mocks .",

    "the magnitude of the two corrections is fairly similar , but the opposite signs mean that these corrections tend to cancel each other out .",

    ", we suggest that this trend might be linked to the smooth accretion of dark matter , which brings no new stellar mass , and amounts to as much as 40% of the growth of dark matter halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or the destruction of satellites and a growing icl component .    the shaded grey area in figure [ tot_sm_content ] indicates the statistical error on @xmath0 .",
    "the statistical error is small compared to the systematic uncertainty associated with the actual derivation of stellar masses .",
    "we will return to this issue shortly in section [ sys_error ] .",
    "we now calculate @xmath0 at group scales using the cosmos x - ray group catalog .",
    "figure [ tot_sm_content_500c_matt ] shows our estimates for @xmath85 ( top row ) , @xmath65 ( middle row ) , and @xmath0 ( bottom row ) as derived from the group catalog ( the correction factors from table [ corr_fac ] have been applied ) .",
    "each colored data point in figure [ tot_sm_content_500c_matt ] represents a measurement from one x - ray group .",
    "the thick black data point represents the mean value in each halo mass bin ( see table [ bin_schem ] ) .",
    "the horizontal error corresponds to the width of the bin while the vertical error represents @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the measured dispersion in the bin and @xmath119 is the number of groups in the bin .",
    "the solid filled symbols in figure [ tot_sm_content_500c_matt ] indicate systems for which the weak lensing analysis of george et al . in prep suggests that the group centering might be unreliable ( mmgg@xmath90 is different than mmgg@xmath120 ) .",
    "we do not find a strong correlation between these systems and either halo mass or @xmath0 , and find that the results are unchanged if these systems are removed from the analysis .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the hod method and the group catalog method for @xmath85 ( compare the red squares to the red dotted line ) .",
    "regarding @xmath65 , there is a small but consistent offset between the two methods ( compare the yellow diamonds to the yellow dashed line ) . indeed , in all three redshift bins , the @xmath65 values as measured from the group catalog are higher than those derived from the hod method by about 20% to 50% .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the hod predictions for @xmath65 in figure [ tot_sm_content_500c_matt ] have been derived under the assumption that the distribution of satellite galaxies follows the same nfw as their parent halos .",
    "we hypothesize that the offset for @xmath121 seen in figure [ tot_sm_content_500c_matt ] might indicate that either a ) the satellite mass distribution has different concentration than the dark matter or b ) the satellite mass distribution varies with stellar mass ( `` mass segregation '' ) . the observed level of offset , however , does not affect the main conclusions of this paper and so we leave a more detailed investigation of this effect for future work .",
    "overall , the two methods show a remarkable level of agreement especially considering the fact that they are subject to very different types of systematic errors .",
    "the two methods agree to within 30% for the estimated value for @xmath0 at group scales .",
    "the statistical uncertainty on @xmath0 ( from both the hod method or the group catalog ) is much smaller than the systematic uncertainty associated with the determination of stellar masses .",
    "for example , according to @xcite , the typical systematic error associated with photometric - based stellar mass estimates are of order @xmath123 dex .",
    "this systematic uncertainty arises from the choice of a stellar population synthesis ( sps ) model , the choice of a dust attenuation model , and the assumed functional form of the star formation history .",
    "in addition , there are also further uncertainties due to the choice of an imf .",
    "further details regarding systematic errors in stellar mass measurements can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we attempt to quantify how the systematic errors described above might translate into an uncertainty on @xmath0 .",
    "note that the aim here is only to provide a first attempt to discuss systematic errors on @xmath0 due to uncertainties in stellar mass estimates ( to our knowledge , this has not yet been quantified ) .",
    "we will make certain assumptions that will undoubtedly need to be refined in future work .",
    "we focus on the low redshift results here ( @xmath124 ) because the method used here relies on the availability of a large number of published smfs .    to begin with , we note that the smf provides the strongest observational constraints on the hod model of l11 .",
    "the other two observables used by l11 ( clustering and galaxy - galaxy lensing ) contain additional information , but this is less dominant than the information from the smf . in this paper , we will therefore make the simplifying assumption that the main source of systematic error in the determination of @xmath0 is due to uncertainties related to the smf . under this assumption ,",
    "the task of determining systematic errors on @xmath122 now becomes one of determining systematic errors on the observed smf .",
    "we consider two distinct sources of error for the smf :    1 .",
    "a systematic error due to the choice of an imf . in this paper",
    ", we specifically consider the salpeter and the chabrier imf @xcite .",
    "to first order , the choice of a chabrier versus a salpeter imf , yields masses that are lower by about 0.25 dex . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume here that we can simply convert between these two imfs using a difference of 0.25 dex and we will refer to this difference as the `` imf systematic error on the smf '' . note that another imf that is often considered is the kroupa imf @xcite .",
    "the kroupa imf yields stellar masses that are larger than a chabrier imf by about 0.05 dex .",
    "we neglect any possible variations of the imf with either galaxy type and/or redshift but note that this is another potential ( and currently poorly determined ) source of systematic error on @xmath0 .",
    "all other sources of systematic error on the smf , for example , those due to the choice of a sps model , the choice of a dust attenuation model , and the assumed functional form of the star formation history",
    ". we will refer to these together as the `` non - imf systematic errors on the smf '' .    to estimate the non - imf systematic errors , we consider a compilation of various published smfs at @xmath125 .",
    "figure [ smf_comp ] shows an ensemble of low - z ( @xmath125 ) mass functions from cosmos @xcite and from the sdss @xcite .",
    "all mass functions in figure [ smf_comp ] have been converted to our assumed value of @xmath126 and to a chabrier imf .",
    "observed variations between these different mass functions are due to a combination of systematic error , measurement error , sample variance , and redshift evolution .",
    "we will adopt a conservative approach and assume that all the observed variation in figure [ smf_comp ] is due to non - imf systematic errors in the determination of stellar masses ( this is an assumption that will need to be improved on in future work ) .",
    "we define a lower envelope and an upper envelope that is designed to encompass the observed range of smfs .",
    "this is shown by the grey shaded region in figure [ smf_comp ] .",
    "in what follows , we assume that this grey shaded region represents the non - imf systematic errors on the smf .",
    "there is , however , one caveat with this method . our non - imf systematic error margin might be underestimated due to the fact that not all sps models are represented by the set of smfs shown in figure [ smf_comp ] .",
    "for example , the sps models of @xcite are not represented in figure [ smf_comp ] . to date , however , there are no published @xmath125 smfs that have used the @xcite models .",
    "we therefore simply note that this is a limitation with our current method that needs to be improved on in future work .",
    "the next step is to understand how these non - imf errors on the smf might translate into a systematic error on @xmath0 . at present , the hod model of l11 can only be used in conjunction with clustering and galaxy - galaxy lensing measurement .",
    "for this reason , we do not use the l11 hod method for this step .",
    "instead , we will adopt an `` abundance matching '' methodology that assumes there is a monotonic correspondence between halo mass ( or circular velocity ) and galaxy stellar mass ( or luminosity ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "abundance matching techniques are generally designed to fit the smf alone and have fewer free parameters than the hod method .",
    "we follow the abundance matching techniques of @xcite , using @xmath1 halo masses , using both the upper and the lower limits of the grey shaded region in figure [ smf_comp ] .",
    "the abundance matching results are then reported in figure [ sys_err ] as the non - imf systematic error margin for @xmath0 ( solid light grey region ) .",
    "the systematic errors margin for @xmath0 assuming a salpeter imf are estimated by shifting this region upwards by 0.25 dex in stellar mass ( hashed region in figure [ sys_err ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ sys_err ] , the cosmos results are slightly higher than our non - imf systematic error margin in figure [ sys_err ] at @xmath127 m@xmath8 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hod method of l11 and the abundance matching method of @xcite yield slightly different predictions for @xmath0 as function of halo mass ; this is discussed further in the following section .",
    "@xcite have derived constraints on @xmath0 ( see their figure 10 ) by abundance matching to the sdss smf of @xcite .",
    "figure [ sys_err ] shows these results , here translated to @xmath1 halo masses ( magenta dashed line ) and assuming a chabrier imf .",
    "the @xcite results yield a lower amplitude for @xmath0 than the l11 cosmos results .",
    "this is largely driven by differences between the cosmos mass function and the @xcite mass function ( shown in figure [ smf_comp ] ) .    in order to investigate how much of these differences are in fact due to differences in the assumed stellar mass function ,",
    "we have applied the abundance matching technique of @xcite to the cosmos @xmath128 smf .",
    "this is shown as the blue dotted line in figure [ sys_err ] .",
    "this can then be directly compared with the l11 hod results .",
    "we find that the hod results in roughly @xmath129% higher values for all halo masses than the abundance matching technique shown here .",
    "there are several possible sources for the 15% discrepancy between the hod and abundance matching methods .",
    "one possibility is that the weak lensing and/or clustering is providing more information in the hod analyses than is available given the stellar mass function alone , and that this information pushes the values slightly higher .",
    "another potential issue is that conversions have been made in each case to use @xmath1 halo masses ( hod results were calculated initially using @xmath69 and abundance matching was done using @xmath130 ) ; these conversions necessarily make assumptions about the radial profiles of satellites which may be inaccurate at the several percent level .",
    "another possibility is that the abundance matching method might suffer from satellite incompleteness in the n - body simulations ( see e.g. wu et al . in prep ) , however , this is unlikely to be important below the group mass scale .",
    "we leave tracking down the exact source of the difference to future work , and simply note that there is roughly a @xmath129% level uncertainty in the determination of the non - imf systematic uncertainty on @xmath0 due to the method used to derive @xmath0 from the smf .",
    "overall , the difference between l11 and @xcite is consistent with our systematic error margin for @xmath0 , and these differences do not impact any of our conclusions significantly .",
    "we now compare our @xmath0 measurements with two recently published results from @xcite ( hereafter `` gz07 '' ) and @xcite ( hereafter `` gi09 '' ) which have been derived using group and cluster catalogs .",
    "figure [ tot_sm_content_500c ] shows our predictions for @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 compared to the measurements of gz07 and gi09 . in both cases ,",
    "our results suggest _ significantly lower values _ for @xmath0 than reported by either of these previous studies .",
    "we now provide a more detailed comparison with both gz07 and gi09 and discuss possible explanations for the source of the discrepancy .",
    "the left panel of figure [ tot_sm_content_500c ] shows the comparison of our low - z results with gz07 .",
    "yellow diamonds show estimates from gz07 for the contribution to @xmath0 from satellite galaxies whereas dark blue squares show the total stellar fraction ( @xmath121+@xmath131+@xmath132 ) .",
    "the yellow diamonds in figure [ tot_sm_content_500c ] are therefore directly comparable to our prediction for @xmath65 which is shown by the yellow dash - dash line .",
    "gz07 find that @xmath65 increases towards lower halo masses whereas we predict the opposite trend .",
    "it is clear from this figure that a large fraction of the observed discrepancy is due to the @xmath65 component ( and not so much to @xmath131 or @xmath133 ) .",
    "we will now investigate the source of this difference in further detail .    to estimate stellar masses , gz07",
    "have used a cousins i - band mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath134 ) calibrated from the dynamical modeling of 2-d kinematic data from @xcite .",
    "the @xcite sample is comprised of early type galaxies from the sauron sample ( bacon et al .",
    "we note two important caveats with this approach :    1 .",
    "the sauron galaxy sample is comprised solely of elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies which have larger @xmath135 values on average than intermediate and late type galaxies . if the early type fraction increases with halo mass as suggested by several studies ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then this could explain both why gz07 find a steeper slope and a higher amplitude than we do for @xmath65 at group scales .",
    "the @xmath135 ratios presented in @xcite are _ dynamical _ ( i.e total ) and are therefore sensitive to the dark matter fraction within the effective radius ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "the dynamical mass - to - light ratios in @xcite might therefore be biased high by up to @xmath137 compared to the stellar mass - to - light ratios ( see figure 17 in @xcite for example ) .",
    "we now investigate the mass - to - light ratios of our group members compared to the value used by gz07 . for this exercise ,",
    "we consider group members from the membership catalog of ge11 in our two low redshift bins ( bins a and b in figure [ xgroup_bin ] ) .",
    "we derive subaru @xmath138-band mass - to - light ratios from our stellar mass catalog using the absolute @xmath138-band ab magnitude that is provided by the cosmos photoz catalog . for this exercise",
    "we adopt an ab solar luminosity of @xmath139 .",
    "figure [ ml_comp ] shows the @xmath140 values for cosmos group members .",
    "we use unextincted rest frame magnitudes from the cosmos photoz catalog to divide the histogram in figure [ ml_comp ] by galaxy color .",
    "more specifically , we define galaxy color as @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the unextincted rest - frame template magnitudes in the near - ultraviolet and the r bands defined in @xcite .",
    "we adopt the same division as in that paper , namely :    @xmath144 `` high activity '' or `` blue ''    @xmath145 `` intermediate activity '' or `` intermediate ''    @xmath146 `` quiescent '' or `` red ''    we compute the difference in magnitudes between our subaru @xmath138 filter and a cousins i filter for a range of stellar population templates .",
    "we find that a cousins @xmath134 corresponds to a subaru @xmath138 mass - to - light ratio of @xmath147 ( the exact value depends on galaxy color ) .",
    "these values are represented in figure [ ml_comp ] by the hashed magenta region .",
    "figure [ ml_comp ] shows that the stellar masses inferred by using a similar @xmath135 as gz07 are larger than our sed stellar masses by a factor of 2 to 10 ( assuming a chabrier imf ) .",
    "the difference is particularly large for active and intermediate type galaxies .",
    "the large spread observed in figure [ ml_comp ] highlights the fact that the group population is not well represented by any single @xmath138-band @xmath148 ratio value .",
    "part of the observed spread can also be explained by the sensitivity of the @xmath138-band luminosity to recent star formation , underscoring the need for nir data to more accurately determine galaxy stellar mass .",
    "the differences between our mass - to - light ratios and the value used by gz07 is reduced by assuming a salpeter imf ( figure [ ml_comp ] , right panel ) .",
    "even with a salpeter imf , however , the gz07 m / l ratio is still well above the mean m / l ratio of our galaxy sample .",
    "this is likely to be due to the fact that the @xcite mass - to - light ratios are dynamical and are thus sensitive to dark matter in addition to stellar mass .",
    "another important fact worth highlighting in figure [ ml_comp ] is that a non negligible fraction of group members are star forming / intermediate type galaxies ( also see ge11 who find that the quenched fractions in groups is of order 40% to 60% at @xmath149 ) .",
    "note however that figure [ ml_comp ] does not include the corrections described in section [ group_cat_method ] for de - projection or the completeness and purity of the membership selection .",
    "these corrections were derived as adjustments to the total @xmath0 from mock catalogs that do not distinguish quiescent galaxies from active ones , so we can not directly apply them to the separate galaxy types in figure [ ml_comp ] . to address the possibility of color - dependent contamination of the group sample , we can test the purity and completeness of the membership selection using a subsample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts as done in ge11 .",
    "the cosmos spectroscopic redshift sample , however , is dominated by zcosmos `` bright '' galaxies with @xmath150 and is therefore not representative of our group membership sample ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this will induce a degree of uncertainty that can only be reduced with deeper and more representative spectroscopic data and/or more representative mock catalogs .",
    "having noted this caveat , we use this approach to compute the completeness and purity of the membership selection within @xmath14 and as a function of galaxy type . we find that the group populations of red , green , and blue galaxies are overestimated by 14% , 20% , and 30% respectively . after applying these correction factors to groups in bins a and b ( and for galaxies above our stellar mass completeness limit ) , we find that the mean red fraction at @xmath151 is roughly 50% .",
    "so while we do see some added contamination of our group member sample among blue galaxies , they still represent a significant part of the population .",
    "studies that aim to compute @xmath0 must take this varied group population into account .",
    "it is clear that assuming that all group members are quiescent could lead to large biases in @xmath0 estimates .",
    "finally , we now investigate the impact of using a single mass - to - light value similar to the one use by gz07 . for this exercice",
    "we adopt a single value of @xmath152 and we neglect the small color dependance of the @xmath135 conversion from cousins i to subaru @xmath138 ( see figure [ ml_comp ] )",
    ". using the cosmos group catalog , we re - compute @xmath65 using the absolute @xmath138-band ab magnitude provided by the cosmos photoz catalog and a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath152 to derive stellar masses . here",
    ", we only consider @xmath65 . because our analysis does not include icl",
    ", we can not compare with the gz07 @xmath131+@xmath133 component ( these were measured together as a single component by gz07 ) .",
    "however , as noted in figure [ tot_sm_content_500c ] , most of the discrepancy between our results and gz07 occurs for @xmath65 .",
    "figure [ mlratiotest ] shows that we are able to qualitatively reproduce the gz07 @xmath65 using our data and @xmath152 .",
    "note however that the halo mass range and redshift range of our sample does not exactly match gz07 and so figure [ mlratiotest ] is not exactly a one - to - one comparison .",
    "however , the fact that we obtain similar @xmath65 values as gz07 strongly suggests that the primary cause of the discrepancy is due the fact that @xmath152 largely overestimates the stellar masses of group members compared to our full sed fitting technique .",
    "gi09 have used the cosmos data and an earlier version of our x - ray catalog to derive @xmath0 .",
    "since we use the same data set and a similar group catalog , our results are directly comparable . the right panel of figure [ tot_sm_content_500c ] shows the comparison of our results with gi09 . since gi09 report the average over all groups at @xmath59 , their results are most comparable with our @xmath153 redshift bin . to estimate stellar masses , gi09 have used a galaxy - type dependent stellar mass - to-@xmath45 band luminosity ratio derived by using the analytical relation from @xcite assuming a salpeter imf .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , the @xcite @xmath154 relation was only calibrated for massive galaxies . in practice",
    "the k - band mass - to - light ratio varies with galaxy age and color .",
    "thus the @xcite @xmath154 relation overestimates the stellar masses of low mass galaxies . @xcite",
    "have shown that the @xcite mass estimates contain galaxy - color dependent biases compared to sed fitting techniques ( see their figure 28 ) .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the @xcite masses are biased high by more than 0.3 dex for star forming galaxies with @xmath155 .",
    "thus , including these galaxies will lead to an overestimate of @xmath0 .    since the gi09 results are based on cosmos data",
    ", we can make a direct comparison between their mass estimates and ours .",
    "we match our galaxy catalog with the photoz catalog that was used by gi09 .",
    "we then recompute @xmath0 from our catalog using the same procedure as in section [ results_group ] but using the @xcite masses and the results are shown in section [ results_group ] .",
    "for this exercise we have used the same redshift and halo mass bins as in section [ results_group ] ( see table [ bin_schem ] ) .",
    "note however that we do not apply the purity / completeness and de - projection correction factors here . indeed , since the gi09 stellar masses are different than ours , we would need a new set of mock catalogs to perform this correction .",
    "the correction values however are typically only of order 5 to 14% and are much smaller than difference between our results and gi09 ( a factor of @xmath1562.5 ) . neglecting these correction factors here",
    "should therefore not change our main conclusions .",
    "figure [ mlratiotest2 ] shows that we obtain roughly similar values for @xmath0 as gi09 when we use the @xcite masses . in detail , however , we do not exactly find the same mean values as a function of halo mass as gi09 but our methods are sufficiently different ( ge11 use a bayesian probabilistic method whereas gi09 use a background subtraction method ) that this is not too unexpected .",
    "part of the observed difference in figure [ mlratiotest2 ] is due to the fact that gi09 use a salpeter imf whereas we use a chabrier imf ( this accounts for about 0.25 dex ) .",
    "the remaining difference ( about 0.15 dex ) is probably due to a combination of differences in the techniques that we have used and to differences in stellar mass estimates .",
    "in this paper we have derived the total stellar mass fraction , @xmath0 , as a function of host halo mass from @xmath2 to @xmath3 using hod methods , abundance matching methods , and direct estimates from group catalogs .",
    "our stellar masses are derived from full sed fitting to multi - band photometry ( including k - band ) from the cosmos survey . assuming a chabrier imf , we find significantly lower estimates for @xmath0 at group scales than previous work . including ( non - imf ) systematic errors on stellar masses",
    ", our analysis suggests that @xmath157 at @xmath7 m@xmath8 and @xmath158 at @xmath10 m@xmath8 .",
    "we will make files available upon request including our @xmath0 estimates and the associated systematic uncertainties .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .   assuming a chabrier imf , we find that previously published estimates of @xmath0 on group scales could be overestimated by a factor of two to five .",
    "this discrepancy is only partially reduced by assuming a salpeter imf .",
    "we investigate the cause of this discrepancy and find that a large fraction of the observed difference can be explained by the use of over - simplistic mass - to - light ratio estimates",
    "we show that galaxies in groups are a mixed population of quiescent , intermediate , and star forming galaxies . as a consequence , galaxies in groups",
    "are not well represented by any single @xmath135 ratio value .",
    "the assumption that all galaxies in groups are quiescent , for example , will lead to biases in @xmath0 estimates .",
    "we quantify the systematic uncertainty on @xmath0 using abundance matching methods and show that the statistical uncertainty on @xmath0 ( @xmath4% ) is currently dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellar mass measurements ( @xmath5% excluding imf uncertainties ) .",
    "we provide first estimates for the systematic error margin on @xmath0 due to uncertainties in stellar mass measurements .",
    "while we have tried to provide a conservative estimate for these systematic errors , it is also clear that this is a non - trivial task that will require further investigation .",
    "one aspect in particular that could be improved on in this respect would be to consider a larger set of smfs that cover a more representative range of sps models than we have used here .",
    "4 .   while direct measurements of @xmath0 using group and cluster catalogs are necessary and important , hod and abundance matching methods can probe @xmath0 over a much wider halo mass range than possible using group and cluster catalogs .",
    "for example , in cosmos , hod methods allows us to probe @xmath0 down to the stellar mass completeness limit of the survey ( @xmath159 m@xmath8 and @xmath160 m@xmath8 at @xmath48 ) . in cosmos",
    ", we show that the hod method and the group catalog method are in good overall agreement but exhibit some small but interesting differences regarding the contribution to @xmath0 from satellite galaxies ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "5 .   using identical data sets",
    ", we find that the hod method of @xcite and the abundance matching method of @xcite agree to within 15% in terms of determining @xmath0 .",
    "identifying the cause of remaining small differences between the two methods will require further investigation , but these small differences do not affect the main conclusions of this paper .",
    "our finding that the total stellar fraction in groups is lower than previously estimated has interesting implications for the thermodynamic history of the intra - group gas . in simulations ,",
    "the relative proportions of gas mass to stellar mass are directly related to the efficiency of cooling , star formation , and agn feedback ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "suppressed gas mass fractions at small radii might indicate that gas has been removed from the centers of groups and clusters by non gravitational processes .",
    "for example , recent simulations from @xcite have suggested that low entropy gas might be ejected from the progenitors of present - day groups by agn feedback at high redshift ( primarily @xmath161 ) at the epoch when super - massive black holes are in quasar mode .",
    "on the other hand , low gas mass fractions might also be exactly compensated for by @xmath0+@xmath18 in such a way that the total baryon fraction is constant with halo mass and with halo radius .",
    "discriminating between these two scenarios is key towards understanding how much gas may have been ejected from these systems .    in figure",
    "[ compare_sun ] , we have compared our results with the mean gas mass fraction ( @xmath13 ) from @xcite , computed from a compilation of data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this result demonstrates that @xmath0 is always lower than @xmath13 for halos above @xmath12 , for the assumption of either a salpeter or chabrier imf .",
    "figure [ tot_f ] shows the sum of @xmath0 and @xmath13 . here",
    "the solid grey region indicates the systematic error margin for @xmath0+@xmath13 assuming a chabrier imf ; the grey hashed region shows the systematic error margin for @xmath0+@xmath13 assuming a salpeter imf . even in the latter case",
    ", we find a shortfall in @xmath0+@xmath13 compared to the cosmic mean , which increases towards lower halos masses .",
    "it is important to note that figure [ tot_f ] does _ not _ include a baryonic contribution from icl .",
    "while including icl in the baryon budget is obviously an important issue to be adressed , @xmath18 estimates suffer from large uncertainties related to the choice of a @xmath135 value .",
    "for example , the icl estimates of @xcite assume @xmath134 ; figure [ ml_comp ] demonstrates this is on the high end compared to @xmath162 values predicted from sps models .",
    "finally , we note that the main claim in this paper , that @xmath0 estimates are lower than previously estimated , is dominated by the @xmath65 component of @xmath0 .    in summary ,",

    "<S> measurements of the total amount of stars locked up in galaxies as a function of host halo mass contain key clues about the efficiency of processes that regulate star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the total stellar mass fraction @xmath0 as a function of halo mass @xmath1 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 using two complementary methods . </S>",
    "<S> first , we derive @xmath0 using a statistical halo occupation distribution model jointly constrained by data from lensing , clustering , and the stellar mass function . </S>",
    "<S> this method enables us to probe @xmath0 over a much wider halo mass range than with group or cluster catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> second , we derive @xmath0 at group scales using a cosmos x - ray group catalog and we show that the two methods agree to within 30% . we quantify the systematic uncertainty on @xmath0 using abundance matching methods and we show that the statistical uncertainty on @xmath0 ( @xmath4% ) is dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellar mass measurements ( @xmath5% excluding imf uncertainties ) . assuming a chabrier imf </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath6 at @xmath7 m@xmath8 and @xmath9 at @xmath10 m@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> these values are significantly lower than previously published estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the cause of this difference and find that previous work has overestimated @xmath0 due to a combination of inaccurate stellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies in groups are early type galaxies with a constant mass - to - light ratio . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to previous claims , our results suggest that the mean value of @xmath0 is always significantly lower than @xmath11 for halos above @xmath12 . combining our results with recently published gas mas fractions , we find a shortfall in @xmath0+@xmath13 at @xmath14 compared to the cosmic mean . </S>",
    "<S> this shortfall varies with halo mass and becomes larger towards lower halos masses . </S>"
