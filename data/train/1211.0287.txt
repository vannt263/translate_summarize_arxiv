    "in hierarchical clustering models , clues about the galaxy formation process are encoded in correlations between galaxy properties and their environments .",
    "this has motivated measurements of such correlations .",
    "traditional measures are intended to allow one to quantify if galaxies in dense regions tend to be more luminous , or redder , or older , or tend to move faster than average , and so on .",
    "these conclusions depend critically on how the density @xmath1 was estimated : fixed aperture measurements count the number of galaxies @xmath2 that are within volume @xmath3 of an object ( i.e. , the numerator of the ratio @xmath1 varies from one object to another ) , whereas near - neighbour measurements find the @xmath3 that contains @xmath2 nearest neighbours ( i.e. , the denominator is stochastic ) .",
    "clearly , the size and shape of @xmath3 , or the choice of @xmath2 matter greatly ( the universe is homogeneous on sufficiently large @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) . in addition , the choice of three - dimensional or projected surface density matters as well , as do the redshift uncertainties and sample selection .",
    "determining which of the many observed correlations is fundamental , and which is a consequence of others , can be a subtle task , especially since the environment is often the least well determined of a galaxy s attributes .",
    "moreover , the estimate of the environment is often sufficiently complicated that it can not be modelled or interpreted analytically .",
    "mark clustering statistics are fundamentally different , in the sense that they are , strictly speaking , statements about pairs , triples , quadruples , etc . , of galaxies , rather than about single objects ( stoyan & stoyan 1994 ) .",
    "for example , the most commonly used such statistic returns an estimate of how the properties of galaxy pairs ( rather than of single galaxies ) depend on pair separation .",
    "( while this is easily extended to triples , quadruples , etc .",
    ", such estimates are rarely ever made . ) in essence , for each pair separation @xmath4 , this statistic weights each galaxy in a pair by its own attribute ( e.g. , luminosity , colour , etc .",
    ", expressed in units of the mean across the population ) and then divides this weighted pair count by the unweighted one .",
    "symbolically , one may write this statistic as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for the weighted and unweighted pair counts at separation @xmath4 .    previous estimates of @xmath8 have shown that close pairs of galaxies are more luminous ( beisbart & kerscher 2000 ) , redder ( skibba et al . 2006 ) , and older ( sheth et al .",
    "2006 ) than average ( @xmath9 for @xmath4 less than a few @xmath10mpc ) . while these trends are qualitatively the same as those returned by traditional estimates , and they are also in qualitative agreement with galaxy formation models ( sheth 2005 ) , the mark statistics are particularly interesting because a theoretical framework exists for interpreting such measurements quantitatively ( sheth 2005 ; skibba et al .",
    "2006 ) . on the other hand , this is also a drawback , because the theoretical framework is almost required if one wishes to draw more than qualitative conclusions from such measurements .",
    "this is because the magnitude of the ( say ) luminosity - weighted signal changes if one weights instead by the log of the luminosity ( sheth , connolly & skibba 2005 ; skibba et al .",
    "2006 ) . since the same physics has led to both signals , one would like the measurement to not depend on the ` units ' in which the measurement was made .",
    "this dependence on ` units ' derives from the fact that the magnitude of @xmath8 depends on the distribution of the weights ( e.g. , its width , the length of its tails , etc . ) .",
    "needless to say , it also complicates efforts to determine if one observable correlates more strongly with environment than another . as a case in point , it has long been known that cluster galaxies tend to be redder than average , but there is a wide range in luminosity between the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) and the dwarf satellites in a cluster .",
    "since clusters are regions of high density , one naively expects to find that colour correlates more strongly with environment than does luminosity .",
    "however , the mark correlation signal appears to have a larger amplitude for luminosity than it does for colour ( skibba & sheth 2009 ) .",
    "one of the main goals of the present work is to show how to remove this effect from the measurement , so that the magnitude of the signal can be compared across different weights .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the galaxy catalogues used throughout the paper . in section  [ sec : mcfresults ] we demonstrate that mark correlations are particularly sensitive probes of environmental correlations ; they correctly show a strong signal even when traditional estimates based on how one - point statistics vary as a function of environment are unable to see one  a fact that was recently exploited by paranjape & sheth ( 2012 ) . in section  [ sec : markstats ]",
    "we show how to remove the effect of the mark correlation signal on ` units ' , arguing that for any given weight , one should simply rank order and use the rank as the weight .",
    "we then use these rank - ordered mark correlations to compare different mark correlation signals with one another .",
    "a final section summarizes our findings .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a spatially flat cosmology with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . we write",

    "we refer the reader to m12 for details about the dark matter simulation , halo - finding algorithm , and the procedure for populating the haloes with galaxies .",
    "we begin with the millennium simulation ( springel et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is a large @xmath16-body simulation of dark matter structure in a cosmological volume .",
    "dark matter particles are traced in a cubic box of @xmath17 on a side , with a halo mass resolution of @xmath18",

    "an important assumption in the model is that all galaxy properties  their numbers , spatial distributions , velocities , luminosities , and colours  are determined by halo mass alone .",
    "we specify a minimum @xmath4-band luminosity for the galaxies in the catalogue , @xmath19 , to stay well above the resolution limit of the millennium simulation , avoiding any issues of completeness that may bias our results .",
    "this procedure produces a mock galaxy catalogue containing 1.84 million galaxies , of which 29 percent are ` satellite ' galaxies .",
    "galaxies occupy haloes with masses ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "we show a slice of the mock light cone in figure  [ fig : slice ] , in which more luminous galaxies are identified with larger points , and red and blue sequence galaxies with red and blue points .",

    "most of the analysis of environmental correlations throughout this paper is based on the mock galaxy catalogue , with additional comparisons to the sdss galaxy catalogue in section  [ sec : lcrankmcfs ] .",
    "in what follows , we will refer to any property of a galaxy , e.g. , its luminosity or its colour , as a ` mark ' . as stated above",
    ", the most commonly used mark statistic is the mark correlation function , which is defined as the ratio of the weighted / unweighted correlation function : @xmath30 where @xmath8 is the pair count ratio .",
    "the mark projected correlation function is similarly defined : @xmath31 . if the weighted and unweighted clustering are significantly different at a particular separation @xmath4 , then the mark is correlated ( or anti - correlated ) with the environment at that scale ; the degree to which they are different quantifies the strength of the correlation .    in this section ,",
    "we illustrate that mark correlation functions are particularly sensitive to environmental effects .",
    "we do so by introducing a small additional dependence of a galaxy mark @xmath32 ( luminosity or colour here ) on the galaxy s overdensity ( using one of the environment measures defined below ) .",
    "( we use the letter @xmath32 because , when we discuss mark correlations below , we treat the mark @xmath32 as a ` weight ' . )",
    "that is , if a galaxy has mark @xmath32 , then we change it to @xmath33 we then rank order the marks @xmath34 and rescale them so that they have the same distribution as before the environmental effect was added .",
    "i.e. , we require @xmath35 therefore , by construction , there is no trace of the additional correlation with environment in the one - point statistics of @xmath34 ; it is only by studying how the one - point distribution changes as a function of environment ( the traditional approach ) , or by measuring spatial correlations ( such as mark correlations ) , that one might discover this correlation .",
    "the question is : which approach is more efficient , especially for small @xmath36 when @xmath37 ?",
    "there are many different methods of quantifying the environment , but most of them can be categorized into those that use a fixed aperture ( fa ) and others that use near - neighbor ( nn ) finding .",
    "a variety of environment measures are analyzed in m12 , and we use a subset of these , which are briefly described below . unless stated otherwise , all of the fa and nn overdensities used in this paper are based on redshift - space distances , as they would be in real data . in addition , in all cases the density - defining population ( ddp ) consists of galaxies brighter than the luminosity threshold , @xmath22 .",
    "fa measures are often expressed as a local density contrast , determined by counting the number of galaxies within a given radius , and taking the ratio with the mean density .",
    "the density contrast is typically defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of galaxies found in the aperture , and @xmath40 is the mean number of galaxies that would be expected in the aperture if the galaxies were randomly distributed .",
    "the motivation for using apertures of a particular size is often so that they enclose all of the galaxies within a dark matter halo , while accounting for the effect of redshift - space distortions and redshift uncertainties ( abbas & sheth 2005 ; gallazzi et al .",
    "we use @xmath41 , the overdensity in spherical apertures of radius @xmath42 ( croton et al .",
    "2005 ; abbas & sheth 2005 ) .",
    "cylindrical apertures and annuli ( gallazzi et al .  2009 ; wilman et al .",
    "2010 ) yield qualitatively similar results .",
    "nn measures exploit the fact that objects with nearer neighbors tend to be found in denser environments .",
    "a value of @xmath16 is chosen that specifies the number of neighbors around the point of interest .",
    "one can define a projected surface density or a spherical density : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the radius to the @xmath16-th nearest neighbor .",
    "we use the baldry et al .",
    "( 2006 ) measure , which is an average of @xmath45 for @xmath46 and 5 with a redshift limit ( @xmath47 ) on the ddp , and the @xmath48 measure for @xmath49 described in m12 . in order to use these similarly as the fixed - aperture overdensities ,",
    "the nn densities need to be normalized , and we do this by defining @xmath50  , where @xmath51 is one of the two density measures described above [ i.e. , @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "overdensity distributions for fixed - aperture ( fa ) environment measures [ @xmath42 spheres ( black solid histogram ) and cylinders ( red long - dashed histogram ) ] , and for nearest - neighbor ( nn ) environment measures [ @xmath54 ( blue short - dashed histogram ) and @xmath52 ( magenta dotted histogram ) ] , which have longer tails at large @xmath0 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : deltadists ] shows the distribution of these @xmath0 overdensities in the mock catalogue .",
    "note that the fa overdensity distributions have a similar shape ( see also de la torre et al .",
    "2010 ) , as do those of the nn overdensities . for simplicity , throughout the rest of this paper we will usually focus on a single fa environment measure , 8  mpc/@xmath55 spheres , and a single nn measure , the combination of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which we will henceforth refer to as @xmath54 .",
    "clearly , the nn measures have longer tails with larger @xmath0 , consistent with the expectation that they probe smaller scale environments .",
    "( that is , if the nn weights trace the environment within haloes , then we expect them to have @xmath58 ; and if the fa weights trace the environment around each halo , they should have @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the rms variance of the linear density fluctuation field within @xmath42 spheres . ) as we show below , mark correlations allow us to quantify this expectation . but before doing so , we note that standardizing the distributions by subtracting the mean and dividing by the rms still yields distributions with different shapes .      in",
    "what follows , we will illustrate our results using these fa and nn overdensities . specifically , in this section we will insert @xmath61 in equations  ( [ eq : weight ] ) and  ( [ eq : rescale ] ) to define @xmath34 for each galaxy , thus adding an environmental dependence to @xmath32 ( luminosity or colour ) , and then we will measure the distribution of ( rescaled ) @xmath34 in a number of different overdensity bins .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfs ] shows the results for the luminosity marks .",
    "the various histograms in each panel show the overdensity dependent luminosity distributions , @xmath62 , for various choices of @xmath36 ( 0 , 0.01 , and 0.05 ) .",
    "the different panels show different bins in @xmath61 ( lowest and highest 10% ; @xmath62 of intermediate bins have smaller differences ) , and there are clearly more luminous galaxies and fewer faint galaxies in dense environments .",
    "the question is whether the differences between the @xmath63 counts and the others are statistically significant .",
    "obviously , one must be far from @xmath64 to see a difference ; how far is far enough depends on @xmath36 .",
    "kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) tests suggest that large values of @xmath36 and/or @xmath61 far from @xmath65 are required .",
    "since the large @xmath66 tails typically contain a small fraction of the full sample ( figure  [ fig : deltadists ] ) , this technique , in effect , can not use the vast majority of the sample to detect the fact that environment matters . as described earlier in section",
    "[ sec : mcfresults ] , to allow for a fair comparison , we have rank ordered and rescaled the luminosities so that they have the same distributions [ @xmath67 , where @xmath68 are the luminosities with @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the overall luminosity distributions are the same by construction , but at fixed overdensity the rescaled ones ( with @xmath70 ) may be shifted from the original one ( @xmath63 ) . in each panel of the figure , we find that the differences between the luminosity distributions @xmath71 and @xmath62 appear to be very small , except for @xmath63 versus @xmath72 with the nn overdensity .    -band luminosity functions for bins of environmental overdensity ( upper panels : ranked by @xmath42 sphere overdensities ; lower panels : ranked by @xmath73 and @xmath74 nn overdensities ) . only the distributions for the lowest - density ( left ) and highest - density ( right ) 10 percent are shown .",

    "figure  [ fig : colordists ] shows a similar analysis of ( rescaled ) @xmath75 colours .",
    "recall that the distributions , when averaged over all @xmath61 , have been rescaled to be the same .",
    "it is evident that there are fewer red galaxies in underdense regions than in very dense ones .",
    "in addition , in any overdensity bin , the distributions of @xmath76 and @xmath77 $ ] are similar , but with significant differences in the red sequence at very low and very high overdensities .    in general",
    ", the weak dependence on @xmath0 appears to produce subtle differences in the luminosity and colour distributions .",
    "we quantify the statistical significance of this with kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) tests .",
    "we find that these in fact yield low ks probabilities , indicating that the distributions @xmath78 , where @xmath32 is luminosity or colour , do have statistically significant differences , even for low values of @xmath36 .",
    "however , the significance depends on the number statistics , and typical sdss galaxy catalogues are at least 25 times smaller than the mock catalogue used here .",
    "when we account for this , at fixed density , we obtain @xmath79=0.14 and 0.51 for @xmath80 in the lowest and highest density bins for the fa overdensities , respectively , making these distributions statistically indistinguishable , while the corresponding colour distributions are marginally distinguishable . for larger values of @xmath36 , and for the nn overdensities ,",
    "lower probabilities are obtained ( @xmath81 ) , indicating statistically significant differences between the luminosity and colour distributions , especially near the peak of the red sequence .",
    "note that for these probability distribution functions , we have normalized by the mean luminosity or colour of the full catalogue ; if we normalize by the mean of a given density bin , then @xmath78 become more similar ( @xmath79 close to unity are obtained , indicating virtually identical distributions ) , except for @xmath72 in the highest density bin .",

    "dotted lines indicate the 1-@xmath51 range between the 16 and 84 percentiles . ]",
    "one can also consider the ` colour - density relation ' or density - dependent red fraction ( e.g. , hogg et al .",
    "2003 ; balogh et al .  2004",
    "; cooper et al .  2006 ; weinmann et al .  2006 ; park et al .  2007 ) .",
    "we show the @xmath82 colour - density relation of the mock catalogue in figure  [ fig : colordens ] , using the @xmath42 sphere overdensities .",
    "note the dip in the relation between the blue cloud and red sequence .",
    "the colour - density relations for the colours modified by @xmath83 and rescaled following equation  ( [ eq : rescale ] ) are also shown . with @xmath70 ,",
    "the colours have been given an additional environmental dependence , and thus we expect them to have a stronger ( i.e. , steeper ) correlation with overdensity compared to @xmath63 .",
    "evidently , the colour - density relation is only slightly steepened for @xmath70 and would be difficult to detect , depending on the environment measure used ( see also m12 ) .",
    "in addition , the relations only cross for the red - sequence colours , so the densities in overdense regions must be accurate in order to detect different environmental trends .",
    "the analogous ` luminosity - density ' relation ( not shown ) has a similar shape as the luminosity - halo mass relation ( e.g. , more et al .",
    "2009 ) , except that at luminosities fainter than @xmath84 ( the break in the luminosity function ) , the relation has increased scatter and is no longer monotonic .",
    "this behavior is not due to faint satellite galaxies in group / cluster environments , which are outnumbered by faint ` field ' galaxies ; it is instead due to the fact that both fa and nn environment measures do not accurately probe the environments of low - mass haloes ( see m12 for details ) .",
    "we now turn to the mark correlation measurements , as an alternative to the traditional approach to quantifying environmental correlations .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : dcenviro ] , for @xmath85 and 0.05 , using the fa overdensities .",
    "note that even a dependence as weak as @xmath86 results in a significantly stronger signal , while the effect of @xmath72 is substantially larger still . to clearly demonstrate this , the lower panels of the figures show the ratio of these mark correlation functions ( triangle and square points ) to that of the unmodified ( @xmath63 ) mark correlation functions ( solid curves ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the jack - knife errors of the clustering measurements , indicating that the environmental correlations with @xmath85 are detectable except for the smallest separations . we have also estimated jack - knife errors of similar measurements of the sdss catalogue described in section  [ sec : sdss ] , and have found that these are systematically larger than the errors of the mock catalogue s mark correlations . nonetheless , we find that a dependence on @xmath86 is still detectable at least for colour marks .",
    "note that the quantitative effect of @xmath36 on the mark correlation functions is similar . in appendix",
    "[ app:2alpha ] , we argue that the @xmath83 weighting adds a new mark signal which , for @xmath87 , is proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , given the mark correlation with a particular value of @xmath36 dependence ( e.g. , @xmath85 ) , we can predict the signal for a different @xmath36 ( e.g. , @xmath72 ) .",
    "this expectation is borne out : the predicted mark correlation functions with @xmath72 are nearly identical to the measured ones .",
    "we show analogous mark correlation functions using nn overdensities in figure  [ fig : ibsmenviros ] . these overdensities are clearly more sensitive to small - scale environmental correlations than large - scale ones .",
    "in addition , the new mark signal for @xmath85 is larger than for the fa overdensities ( triangle points in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcenviro ] ) , which is due to the long tail of the nn overdensities at large @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : markstats ] , we account for this effect and find that these overdensities are particularly sensitive to environmental correlations on scales smaller than @xmath89 .",
    "an advantage of the mark correlation approach is that it quantifies the scale dependence of environmental trends , and that it exploits the entire dataset ( rather than splitting a sample with overdensity cuts , for example ) .",
    "we now demonstrate how mark correlation functions quantify the scale dependence of environmental correlations by using the fa and nn estimates of the local density around galaxies , @xmath0 , as the weight ( or mark ) . as these quantities are intended to be direct probes of galaxy environments , rather than indirect ones such as luminosity or colour",
    ", one would expect stronger mark correlation signals than those obtained in the previous section .",
    "the filled symbols in figure  [ fig : densitymcfs ] show the result . the nn weights , using @xmath54 overdensities , produce a much stronger signal , especially on small scales .",
    "this is consistent with previous work , in which a nn local density was used as a weight ( white & padmanabhan 2009 ) . in appendix  [ app :",
    "envwt ] , we also illustrate the effect of using the small - scale environment as a weight .    the obvious jump in amplitude at @xmath90mpc for the nn weight is consistent with the expectation that it probes scales within haloes .",
    "in addition , the fact that the fa signal reaches a maximum at @xmath91mpc , which is roughly the scale of a group or cluster , suggests that these are the pairs which are in the densest larger - scale environments .",
    "the decrease on smaller scales indicates that an increasing fraction of the closest pairs , which may be low - mass interacting galaxies , are not in particularly dramatic larger - scale ( @xmath92mpc ) overdensities . on the other hand , comparing the fa signal to the nn signal is less straightforward .",
    "for example , it is not clear what to make of the fact that the two weights have the same amplitude at scale @xmath93mpc ( other than that pairs separated by @xmath94mpc have weights which are above average by the same factor ) .",
    "this is because the two sets of weights have rather different distributions ( figure  [ fig : deltadists ] ) .",
    "we explore how to remove this in the next section .",
    "as stated previously , the strength of mark correlations is affected by the shape of the marks distributions , which makes it difficult to fairly compare the mark correlations of different marks . to remove the effect of the distributions , we first rank order the marks .",
    "we could then have scaled one of the distributions to the other , but this would not allow us to compare either of these with a third mark , for example . instead , as a more general solution , we perform the rank ordering and then _ use the rank itself as the mark_. the open symbols in figure  [ fig : densitymcfs ] show the result of doing this and then remeasuring ww / dd .",
    "( in practice , we rank order and then match to a uniform distribution on [ 1,n ] . in this way , all marks are scaled to the same distribution , so the mark correlation signal can be compared between marks .",
    "however , the matching to a uniform distribution is not really necessary . )",
    "the rescaling changes the ratio of the small- to large - scale signal dramatically , particularly for the nn weights , for which the required rescaling is much larger . evidently , the large @xmath61 tail in figure  [ fig : deltadists ] contributes significantly to the small @xmath4 signal ; while not unexpected , it is nice to see this confirmation that the nn weights really do correspond to small scale environments .",
    "( we will return to the flatness of the signal shortly . )    on the other hand , notice that now the feature at @xmath91mpc in the fa signal has gone away .",
    "this shows that rescaling comes with a cost , since there may be information in the shape of the distribution , which rank - ordering removes .",
    "spheres and @xmath54 , respectively ) were used as marks .",
    "filled symbols show the original measurement , and open symbols show the result of rank ordering and rescaling to [ 0,1 ] before making the measurement . ]    to illustrate the effect of rank ordering , a model based on cluster and field populations is described in appendix  [ app : clusterfield ] .      throughout this paper",
    "we have used environment measures based on redshift - space distances .",
    "it is important to consider the effect of redshift - space distortions on these environments , in the context of rank - ordered mark correlations .",
    "the nonlinear virial motions of galaxies in haloes spread out objects in groups and clusters along the line - of - sight to produce ` fingers - of - god ' ( fog ; jackson 1972 ; peebles 1980 ) .",
    "these small - scale distortions can affect how galaxy environments are assessed , as we see using the park et al .",
    "( 2007 ) nn environment measures as defined in eqn .",
    "[ eq : nn ] ) . ] in figure  [ fig : nnrnnz ] . in the left figure ,",
    "the real - space and @xmath95-space overdensities clearly have considerable scatter between them , and in @xmath95-space there is a deficit of very large overdensities , due to the fog spreading them out .",
    "this is also seen in the mark correlation functions ( right panel , analogous to the rescaled mark correlations in fig .",
    "[ fig : densitymcfs ] ) .",
    "the fog distortions can result in underestimated densities for small - separation pairs @xmath96 , but overestimated densities for more widely separated pairs ( @xmath97 ) where the fog reach into underdense regions ( see also abbas & sheth 2007 ) .",
    "we have tested this using smaller - scale overdensities ( @xmath52 , used in fig .",
    "[ fig : ibsmenviros ] ) , which have a similar result but the transition between underestimated and overestimated overdensities occurs at smaller separations .",
    "note that the small - scale downturn at @xmath98 in the mark correlations ( in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nnrnnz ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : densitymcfs ] with the fa overdensity marks ) is _ not _ due to fog , since it occurs with the real - space overdensities as well ; it occurs because these environment measures best probe larger - scale environments , as opposed to environment measures with smaller apertures or fewer neighbours .",
    "note too that even though the @xmath99 mark correlations depart from unity at both small and large scales , rescaling to a uniform distribution nonetheless results in @xmath0 mark correlations that are approximately consistent with the real - space ones especially at larger separations , demonstrating the utility of the rank - ordered mark correlations .",
    "we remarked in the introduction that it is difficult to compare the usual measurements of the colour and luminosity mark correlations with one another .",
    "these measurements are shown in figure  [ fig : mockvsdatamcfs ] .",
    "note that , in contrast to the previous section , here we also compare measurements in the mocks with similar measurements in the sdss .",
    "the agreement between the triangles and crosses shows that the mock catalogues faithfully reproduce the luminosity and colour dependence of clustering ; since these ww / dd signals were not used to construct the mocks , they represent nontrivial tests of the mock - making algorithm .",
    "while this is reassuring , a puzzle lies in the fact that we naively expect colour to correlate more strongly with environment than luminosity ( e.g. , butcher & oemler 1984 ; bower et al .",
    "1998 ; diaferio et al .",
    "1999 ; blanton et al .",
    "2005 ) , but the ww / dd signals do not show this : the amplitude of the luminosity mark correlations is stronger than that of colour . this is primarily because the two weights have very different distributions ( figs .",
    "[ fig : lfs ] and [ fig : colordists ] ) ; that of luminosity is much broader , such that bright galaxies have @xmath100 .",
    "figure  [ fig : unimarkcfs ] shows the result of rank ordering and using the rank as a mark instead . unlike the previous figure , now colour clearly produces the stronger signal .",
    "it is also worth noting that the error bars are much larger for the @xmath101-weighted signal , showing that a large range of @xmath101-ranks contributes at each @xmath4 ; this range is much narrower for @xmath82 colour .",
    "finally , our rank ordering procedure allows us to compare these measurements with those in section  [ sec : rankorder ] . comparing the luminosity and colour mark correlation functions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mockvsdatamcfs ] ) to the local - density mark correlations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : densitymcfs ] ) shows that both luminosity and colour produce significantly weaker signals .",
    "-band luminosity and @xmath82 colour mark correlation functions for galaxies with @xmath24 in the sdss dr7 ( crosses ) and in the mock catalogue ( triangles ) .",
    "error bars show jack - knife errors on the measurements , and dotted lines show the scatter from randomly scrambling the marks ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "our key results can be summarised as follows :    * mark correlation functions are particularly sensitive to environmental correlations , specifically when using enhanced weights of @xmath83 with @xmath102 , though this sensitivity depends on the environment measure , scale , and the mark s uncertainty .",
    "* small environmental correlations are difficult to detect with more traditional methods , as highlighted by the ( lack of ) variation of most of the mark distributions at fixed overdensity , and in the colour - density relation . *",
    "rank ordering the marks and then using the rank as the weight provides a simple way to compare results for different marks , because it removes any dependence on the marks distributions .",
    "the analysis in this paper highlights the advantages ( and disadvantages ) of mark clustering statistics .",
    "the fact that they are sensitive to weak environmental correlations that traditional methods have difficulty detecting demonstrates their utility .",
    "mark statistics are particularly useful for identifying and quantifying environmental trends .",
    "this owes to the fact that the statistics of entire samples can be folded together , producing clearer correlations than simply binning environments or splitting galaxies into ` field ' and ` cluster ' subsamples , for example .",
    "nonetheless , one can not determine from these trends alone which galaxies occupy which environments ; more information is needed ( e.g. , from halo models of galaxy clustering ) in order to associate particular galaxies with environments of particular halo mass or overdensity ( skibba et al .",
    "2006 ; skibba & sheth 2009 ) .",
    "in contrast , methods that characterize individual local galaxy environments can associate galaxies with overdensities , though they too have strengths and weaknesses .",
    "fixed - aperture and nearest neighbor overdensities are sensitive to inter- and intra - halo environments , respectively , consistent with the findings of m12 and haas et al .",
    "we showed this with the scale - dependent mark clustering measurements , which overlapped at @xmath103 , within the ` one - halo term ' ; fixed apertures , if sufficiently large , can encompass entire haloes as well as some of the surrounding regions .",
    "nonetheless , the interpretation of environmental trends can be difficult , and depends crucially on how the overdensities are measured and on the density - defining population .",
    "one can also interpret our results in terms of central and satellite galaxies in haloes .",
    "since satellite luminosities , colours , and stellar masses depend only weakly on halo mass , and hence only weakly on the environment ( e.g. , skibba et al .  2007 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "2008 ; skibba 2009 ; see also neistein et al .",
    "2011 ; de lucia et al .",
    "2012 ) , the majority of the environmental correlations that we detect are due to the central galaxies .",
    "for example , the colours of central galaxies are strongly halo mass dependent , and this is clearly shown by the colour mark correlations , which are especially sensitive to the dependence on overdensity",
    ".    finally , we note that rank - ordered mark correlation functions are applicable to any comparative analysis of environmental trends involving large catalogues of objects in surveys or simulations with sufficiently accurate distances and marks , and are useful for testing or constraining models .",
    "rank - ordered mark correlations could be useful for quantifying and comparing measures of ` halo assembly bias ' ( e.g. , sheth & tormen 2004 ; wechsler et al .",
    "2006 ; harker et al .  2006 ; croton , gao & white 2007 ; croft et al .",
    "2012 ) , such that halo formation time , concentration , or occupation is weakly correlated with the environment at fixed mass .",
    "these statistics could also be applied to tests of ` halo abundance matching ' ( ham ; vale & ostriker 2006 ; conroy , wechsler & kravtsov 2006 ; neistein et al .  2011 ; trujillo - gomez et al .",
    "2011 ; kang et al .",
    "2012 ) methods , in which central / satellite galaxies and dark matter haloes / subhaloes are rank ordered by their luminosities , masses , or circular velocities , and their cumulative number densities are matched .",
