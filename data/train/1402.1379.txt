    "let @xmath0 be a connected undirected graph with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath2 edges .",
    "let @xmath3 be a linear cost function for the set of edges and @xmath4 be a quadratic cost function to weight each pair of edges ( without loss of generality , assume @xmath5 for all @xmath6 ) .",
    "quadratic minimum spanning tree problem ( qmstp ) _ requires to determine a spanning tree @xmath7 , so as to minimize its total cost @xmath8 , i.e. , the sum of the linear costs plus the quadratic costs .",
    "naturally , this problem can be formulated as follows ( cordone & passeri , 2012 ) :    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    where @xmath13 if edge @xmath14 belongs to the solution , @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "@xmath16 is a subset of @xmath17 and @xmath18 denotes the set of edges with both end vertices in @xmath16 .    as an extension of the classical _ minimum spanning tree problem ( mst ) _ in graphs , the qmstp has various practical applications in network design problems , where the linear function models the cost to build or use edges , while the quadratic function models interference costs between pairs of edges .",
    "for example , in transportation , telecommunication or oil supply networks , the linear function represents the costs for building each road , communication link or pipe , and the quadratic function represents the extra costs needed for transferring from one road ( link , pipe ) to another one .",
    "normally , the interference costs are limited to pairs of adjacent edges ( maia , goldbarg , & goldbarg , 2013 ; pereira , gendreau , & cunha , 2013 ) , but in some special cases , the interference costs also exist between any pair of edges , especially for situations where the topology has little relation to the physical layout .",
    "as discussed in ( assad & xu , 1992 ; ncan & punnen , 2010 ; palubeckis , rubliauskas , & targamadz , 2010 ) , the qmstp has several equivalent formulations such as the _ stochastic minimum spanning tree problem ( smstp ) _ , the _ quadratic assignment problem ( qap ) _ , and the _ unconstrained binary quadratic optimization problem ( ubqp)_.    during the last two decades , the qmstp has been extensively investigated and many heuristic and exact approaches have been proposed . since the qmstp is @xmath19-hard and is even difficult to approximate ( xu , 1995 ) ,",
    "exact methods are often applied only to solve very small instances . for larger instances",
    ", heuristics are preferred to obtain feasible solutions within a reasonable time .    as for exact methods , assad and xu ( assad & xu , 1992 ; xu , 1995 )",
    "propose a lagrangian branch - and - bound method .",
    "ncan and punnen ( 2010 ) combine the lagrangian relaxation scheme with an extended formulation of valid inequalities to obtain tighter bounds .",
    "cordone and passeri ( 2012 ) re - implement the lagrangian branch - and - bound procedure in ( assad & xu , 1992 ) with some improvements .",
    "very recently , several exact algorithms are proposed for solving other closely related variants . respectively ,",
    "buchheim and klein ( 2013a ; 2013b ) consider a special case of the qmstp with exactly one quadratic term in the objective function , and propose a branch and bound approach to solve it .",
    "the description of this problem is further completed in ( fischer & fischer , 2013 ) .",
    "pereira , gendreau , and cunha ( 2013 ) propose a dynamic column and row generation based linear programming approach , to obtain strong lower bounds for the qmstp with adjacency costs , for which the interference costs are only limited to adjacent edges .",
    "on the other hand , heuristics which attempt to obtain near - optimal results within a reasonable time become the main approaches for solving the _ qmstp _ , especially for large instances .",
    "for instance , two greedy algorithms are proposed in ( xu , 1984 ; assad & xu , 1992 ; xu , 1995 ) .",
    "several genetic algorithms are implemented by zhou and gen ( 1998 ) and tested on instances with up to 50 vertices , showing that their algorithms dominate the above greedy algorithms .",
    "another evolutionary algorithm is proposed for a fuzzy variant of the qmstp ( gao , lu , & li , 2004 ; gao & lu , 2005 ) , using the prfer number to encode a spanning tree .",
    "soak , corne , and ahn ( 2005 ; 2006 ) report remarkable results with an evolutionary algorithm using an edge - window - decoder strategy .",
    "in addition to these early methods , even more heuristics have been proposed in recent years , mostly based on local search .",
    "for example , the tabu thresholding algorithm ( ncan & punnen , 2010 ) alternatively performs local search and random moves . in ( palubeckis , rubliauskas , & targamadz , 2010 ) , an iterated tabu search ( its ) is proposed and compared to a multi - start simulated annealing algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm , showing that its performs the best . an artificial bee colony algorithm is developed by sundar and singh ( 2010 ) .",
    "cordone and passeri ( 2012 ) adopt a novel data structure and updating technique to reduce the amortized time at each iteration of neighborhood exploration from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , based on which they further propose a tabu search ( ts ) algorithm and report a number of improved results over previous best known results .",
    "very recently , lozano et al .",
    "( 2013 ) propose an iterated greedy ( ig ) and a strategic oscillation ( so ) heuristic , and combine them with the its ( palubeckis , rubliauskas , & targamadz , 2010 ) algorithm to obtain a powerful hybrid algorithm named hsii .",
    "in addition to the standard qmstp , for the variant only with adjacency costs , maia , goldbarg , & goldbarg ( 2013 ) propose a pareto local search algorithm and adapt the 108 instances in ( cordone & passeri , 2012 ) as benchmarks to evaluate the proposed algorithm .    in this paper , we are interested in the qmstp and propose a three - phase search approach named tps , which uses a randomized constructive procedure for solution initialization , and integrates a descent - based neighborhood search phase based on two different move operators to reach a local optimum from any given starting solution , a local optima exploring phase to discover different local optima within a given regional search area , and a perturbation - based diversification phase to jump out of the current search area and move to unexplored search areas . as a supplementary technique , a fast examination technique is implemented to identify and discard hopeless neighboring solutions , so as to avoid useless computations .",
    "computational results based on 7 sets of 659 representative benchmarks demonstrate that tps yields highly competitive results with respect to the best performing heuristics , showing its effectiveness and efficiency for solving the qmstp .",
    "in particular , for the 630 conventional qmstp instances mostly with unknown optimal results , tps improves the best known results for 31 instances and matches the best known results for the remaining instances only except two cases . for the set of the 29 instances transformed from the _ quadratic assignment problem _ which are known to be difficult for existing qmstp algorithms , tps consistently solve them to optimality within a very short time .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ secapproach ] describes the proposed approach . after providing the computational results in section [ secresults ] , section [ secanalyze ]",
    "analyzes the influence of several important ingredients of the proposed algorithm .",
    "finally , conclusions from this study are drawn in section [ secconclude ] .",
    "the proposed three - phase search approach tps for the qmstp is outlined in algorithm [ algorithmoutline ] , which is composed of several subroutines . respectively , _ init_solution _",

    "the first search phase is ensured by _ descent_neighborhood_search _ which is a descent - based neighborhood search procedure and aims to reach a local optimal solution from a given starting solution . the second search phase _ explore_local_optima _ is used to discover nearby local optima of better quality within the current regional search space .",
    "if no further improvement can be attained , the search turns into a diversified perturbation phase _ diversified_perturb _ , which strongly perturbs the incumbent solution to jump out of the current regional search area in order to displace the search into a new area .",
    "after that , the search enters into a new round of _",
    "descent_neighborhood_search _ and _ explore_local_optima _ search phases again .",

    "fu & hao , 2014 ) , we uniquely represent each feasible solution @xmath32 as a rooted tree ( with vertex 1 fixed as the root vertex , being different from ( cordone & passeri , 2012 ) where the root changes dynamically during the search process ) , corresponding to a one - dimensional vector @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the parent vertex of vertex @xmath46 only except the root vertex 1 ( let @xmath47 ) .",
    "inversely , given a vector @xmath44 , the corresponding solution tree can be easily reconstructed .",
    "tps requires an initial solution to start its search .",
    "moreover , given its stochastic nature , multiple runs of tps from different initial solutions are typically applied to find the best possible solutions for a problem instance . for the qmstp ,",
    "starting from an empty solution @xmath32 containing only the root vertex and no edge , we iteratively select at random one edge from @xmath40 and add it to @xmath32 ( without leading to any closed loop ) , until @xmath48 such edges are added , meaning that a feasible initial solution is generated . in the rest of the paper , a feasible tree will be noted by @xmath7 where @xmath17 and @xmath49 are respectively the vertex set of the graph and the set of edges of the tree .      as the basis of the proposed approach , a descent - based neighborhood search phase _",
    "descent_neighborhood_search _ is used to reach a local optimum from a given starting solution @xmath7 .",
    "for this , we develop two different move operators to generate neighboring solutions .",
    "the first one is the conventional _ swap - edge move operator _ inherited from ( palubeckis , rubliauskas , & targamadz , 2010 ; cordone & passeri , 2012 ; lozano et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "this operator first adds to @xmath31 one of the @xmath50 unused edges @xmath51 , thus closing a loop @xmath52 of @xmath53 edges , and then removes an edge @xmath54 from @xmath55 , to obtain a feasible neighboring solution denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding difference of the objective function ( also called move gain ) is denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "the above move operator swaps only one pair of edges .",
    "it is tempting to introduce a move operator by swapping two pairs of edges to obtain an enlarged neighborhood .",
    "nevertheless , such a move operator induces a neighborhood with a total of @xmath58 neighboring solutions , which is extremely expensive for neighborhood examination . to control the size of the neighborhood , we develop a restricted _ swap - vertex move operator _ as follows .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the subset containing all the vertices with degree equal to 1 ( including all the leaf vertices and possibly the root vertex ) , and for each vertex @xmath60 , let @xmath61 denote the related vertex , i.e. , the vertex connected to @xmath46 . then , for each pair of vertices @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , a feasible neighboring solution denoted by @xmath65 could be generated by swapping vertices @xmath46 and @xmath66 , leading to a difference @xmath67 of the objective function .",
    "note that , if we denote edges @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 by @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 respectively , @xmath76 is indeed equivalent to @xmath77 .",
    "clearly , @xmath76 defines a neighborhood whose size is bounded by @xmath78 .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ figmoveoperator ] illustrates several neighboring solutions generated by the above move operators . respectively , based on the original solution @xmath79 , solution @xmath80 is generated by adding edge @xmath81 and subsequently deleting edge @xmath82 , while solutions @xmath83 and @xmath84 are obtained by swapping the related vertices corresponding to vertices @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "note that , after applying the move operators , the parent - child relationship of some vertices should be reversed ( for example , the relationship between vertices 2 and 3 in sub - figure ( d ) ) , to ensure that vertex 1 is always fixed as the root .",
    "based on these move operators ( @xmath88 and @xmath76 ) , two different neighborhoods @xmath89 and @xmath90 are defined as follows :    @xmath91    where @xmath7 is a feasible solution , and @xmath92 designates the neighboring solution obtained by applying @xmath93 or @xmath94 to @xmath32 .    typically , _",
    "descent_neighborhood_search _ examines ( in random order ) the feasible neighboring solutions belonging to @xmath95 ( i.e. the union of the two neighborhoods ) and applies the first met improving one ( with @xmath96 or @xmath97 ) to replace the incumbent solution .",
    "this process is iterated until no such improving solution exists in the neighborhood , meaning that a local optimum is reached .",
    "additionally , one observes that @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , being statistically much less than @xmath100 . to ensure a fast exploration of neighborhood @xmath89 , in the following subsection",
    ", we develop a pre - estimation technique which is able to identify and discard a large number of useless @xmath88 moves , consequently to reduce the computational complexity needed for _",
    "descent_neighborhood_search_.      like in ( cordone & passeri , 2012 ) , we maintain a vector @xmath101 , whose values indicate the actual or potential contribution of each edge @xmath102 to the overall cost of the incumbent solution @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath103    with this vector , for each of the @xmath21 possible swap - edge moves @xmath88 corresponding to the neighborhood @xmath89 , the objective function varies by ( cordone & passeri , 2012 ) :    @xmath104    which can be calculated in constant time @xmath105 . additionally , after performing the chosen move @xmath88 , vector @xmath101 is updated as follows ( cordone & passeri , 2012 ) :    @xmath106    which takes a total time of @xmath107 .",
    "clearly , the overall complexity for exploring the first neighborhood @xmath89 at each iteration is @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , since each of the @xmath78 possible swap - vertex moves @xmath76 ( i.e. neighborhood @xmath90 ) is equivalent to @xmath77 , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 denote edges @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 respectively , the difference of the objective function is obtained by :    @xmath109    where each term can be evaluated in constant time @xmath105 . then , vector @xmath101 is updated in @xmath107 as follows :    @xmath110    clearly , the computational complexity needed for exploring @xmath90 at each iteration is at most @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , we attempt to reduce the computational time needed for the examination of neighborhood @xmath89 , which is the most expensive part of the first search phase . as mentioned above , at each iteration of _",
    "descent_neighborhood_search _ , up to @xmath21 legal swap - edge moves are possible .",
    "however , many of these moves are definitely hopeless since no improvement over the incumbent solution can be gained .",
    "descent_neighborhood_search _ only accepts improved solutions with @xmath96 , it is interesting to identify these hopeless moves with @xmath112 and discard them directly to avoid irrelevant computations .    based on this idea , we develop a pre - estimation criterion as follows .",
    "let @xmath113 denote the maximum cost value of @xmath114 of all the edges @xmath115 belonging to the incumbent solution @xmath7 , and let @xmath116 denote the maximum possible value of quadratic costs between any pair of edges .",
    "note that @xmath117 is a variable which should be updated at each iteration , within an amount of @xmath118 extra time , while @xmath119 is a constant .",
    "then , it is clear that , for each edge @xmath51 , if we add it to @xmath31 , the objective function would increase by @xmath120 . at this point",
    ", one can observe that no matter which edge @xmath121 we choose to remove from @xmath31 , the decreased cost is strictly bounded within @xmath122 . obviously , if @xmath123 , it means that all the possible moves @xmath124 lead to a solution no better than the incumbent solution @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , it is definitely impossible to obtain an improved solution by exchanging @xmath14 against any other edge belonging to the incumbent solution .",
    "consequently , we can directly discard all these moves to avoid useless evaluations , thus reducing the computation time .",
    "while exploring the neighboring solutions belonging to neighborhood @xmath89 , for each edge @xmath125 , we first use the above pre - estimation criterion to check if it is possible to gain any improvement by exchanging @xmath14 against some other edge @xmath121 .",
    "if this is not the case , we discard all the moves involving @xmath14 and skip to the next edge in @xmath126 .",
    "otherwise , we evaluate one by one the possible legal moves @xmath124 to identify an improving neighboring solution . as shown in section [ secanalyze ] , this fast examination technique allows the algorithm to identify and discard a high number of hopeless moves , accelerating considerably the neighborhood exploration without any sacrifice of solution quality .      obviously , the _ descent_neighborhood_search _ procedure described in section [ subsecns ] alone can not go beyond the achieved local optimum . in order to be able to discover nearby local optima which are possibly of better quality and to intensify the search in a given regional search space , we develop a local optima exploring ( _ explore_local_optima _ ) phase ( algorithm [ algorithmintensivesearch ] ) . the local optima exploring phase is based on",
    "two directed perturbation operators ( denoted by _ directed_perturb _ ) .",
    "inspired by the idea of breakout local search ( benlic & hao , 2013a ; 2013b ; 2013c ) , these directed perturbation operators rely on the tabu search principle ( glover & laguna , 1997 ) , which favors the moves with the weakest deterioration of the objective function .",

    "swapedge(e , f ) _ is declared non - tabu .",
    "typically , the perturbation operator examines all the non - tabu legal moves and iteratively applies the best legal move to the incumbent solution ( no matter it leads to an improved solution or not ) , until a given number @xmath141 ( called perturbation strength ) of such moves are performed .",

    "given these two types of directed perturbation operators , the local optima exploring ( _ explore_local_optima _ ) phase applies them probabilistically : selecting the swap - edge perturbation with probability @xmath149 ( parameter ) , and applying the swap - vertex directed perturbation with probability @xmath150 .",

    "note that , although all the original qap instances have already been solved to optimality by previous qap algorithms ( burkard , karisch , & rendl , 1997 ) , they are difficult for existing qmstp algorithms to reach the optimal solutions , due to the quite special problem structures after transformation .",

    "in fact , for all the 108 instances of group cp and almost all ( 476 out of 480 ) the instances of group op1 , our tps algorithm can easily match the previous best known results .",
    "more importantly , for the left 4 instances of group op1 , tps succeeds in finding several improved solutions .",
    "in addition to these two groups , the following five groups of instances are much more challenging , due to their large - scale problem sizes or special problem structures . to emphasize the effectiveness of tps for solving challenging instances , in this paper , we just provide in detail the results obtained on the five groups of challenging instances , with respect to previous state - of - the - art heuristics , while summarizing the results on groups cp and op1 , to shorten the paper .",
    "as described in section [ secapproach ] , tps requires several parameters : the tabu tenures @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath148 used in the directed perturbation operators , the perturbation strength @xmath141 and @xmath152 , as well as the probability @xmath149 for selecting a directed perturbation operator . generally , these parameters could be tuned with respect to each benchmark group given that the groups have different characteristics and structures . however , to show the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed approach , we uniformly adopt a fixed set of parameter values for all the test instances only except those of group qap - qmstp .",
    "first , we observe in our preliminary experiments that the swap - edge based directed perturbation operator alone performs quite well for all the benchmarks except the group qap - qmstp .",
    "thus we set @xmath161 ( thus disable the swap - vertex directed perturbation operator , rending parameter @xmath148 unnecessary ) .",

    "second , for the group qap - qmstp , we observe that the swap - vertex based directed perturbation operator is extremely useful ( as further discussed in section [ subsecanalyzedirectedperturb ] ) , and the tabu mechanism plays a more important role for solving these instances . following these observations , we set parameter @xmath166 , and enlarge parameter @xmath141 to @xmath167 $ ] , while keeping the same values for the other parameters as above . additionally , for the extra tabu tenure @xmath148 used in the swap - vertex based directed perturbation operator , it is distributed at random within @xmath168 $ ] .",
    "the stopping criterion of our algorithm is provided in the next subsection along with the presentation of the computational results of each benchmark group .",
    "finally , one notices that there is no uniform terminal criterion used by the previous heuristics , various terminal conditions have been adopted by different researchers , for solving different instances .      among the 108 instances generated in ( cordone & passeri , 2008 ) ,",
    "tens of the largest ones have been selected to evaluate several algorithms , i.e. , its ( palubeckis , rubliauskas , & targamadz , 2010 ) , qmst - ts ( cordone & passeri , 2012 ) , hsii ( lozano et al .",
    "respectively , both its and qmst - ts solve each instance 10 times , each run continues until the previous best known solution is reached . ] .",
    "experimental results show that for all these selected instances , each run of its and qmst - ts can unexceptionally reach the best known solution , with a mean computing time ( average of each independent run ) ranging from less than 1 second to about 2 minutes .",
    "hsii also executed 10 independent times to solve each instance , with a cutoff time of 10 seconds for each run . however , for many test instances , hsii occasionally fails to match the previous best known results within the allowed time .    to evaluate the performance of our tps algorithm on this set of 108 instances , we follow its and qmst - ts . in other words , we independently run tps 10 times to solve each instance , each run continues until the best known result is reached .",
    "our results show that , each tps run unexceptionally succeeds in reaching the best known result , with an average time from less than 1 second to less than 2 minutes , indicating that tps performs similarly with respect to its and qmst - ts for this group of small benchmarks .",
    "since these instances are not challenging enough , we do not show our detailed results .",
    "this group consists of three subclasses ( sym , esym , vsym ) , each includes 160 instances , with @xmath153 ranging from 6 to 50 ( a total of 480 instances ) .",
    "these benchmarks have been used to evaluate several previous algorithms , including two exact approaches , i.e. , the refined lagrangian lower bounding procedure in ( ncan & punnen , 2010 ) and the branch - and - bound algorithm qmst - bb in ( cordone & passeri , 2012 ) , as well as two heuristics , i.e. , the rls - tt algorithm in ( ncan & punnen , 2010 ) and the tabu search algorithm qmst - ts in ( cordone & passeri , 2012 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the existing exact approaches can only solve small sized instances with up to @xmath169 vertices . for larger instances ,",
    "only heuristics are able to produce feasible solutions within a reasonable time .",
    "in addition , rls - tt just provides summarized results for these benchmarks , without giving detailed results for each instance .",
    "unfortunately , some of the results reported by rls - tt exhibit internal inconsistencies , probably due to typos mistakes , as pointed out in ( cordone & passeri , 2012 ) .",
    "it means that it is impossible to reproduce the results reported by rls - tt on the inconsistent instances . due to these reasons",
    ", we mainly compare tps with the latest and best heuristic qmst - ts on this group of benchmarks .    to ensure that the computation time required by tps is comparable to that of qmst - ts , we independently apply our tps algorithm 10 times to each instance",
    ", each run continues until the best found solution can not be further improved after 10 consecutive rounds of _ diversified_perturb _ followed by _",
    "descent_neighborhood_search _ and _ explore_local_optima _ search phases , or up to 50 such rounds have been applied .",
    "experimental results show that , for all these 480 instances , tps finds solutions no worse than the previous best known solutions , with an accumulated cpu time ranging from less than one second to about 15 seconds , which is competitive to the runtime required by rls - tt and qmst - ts .",
    "specifically , for four largest instances ( with @xmath153=50 ) of subclass sym , tps succeeds in finding improved solutions missed by previous heuristics .",
