    "the recent use of topological techniques in the cluster state quantum computation scheme  @xcite has lead to some very encouraging fault tolerant threshold predictions .",
    "the initial estimate for the computational basis error threshold was @xmath3  @xcite , but it is believed this could reach as high as @xmath4  @xcite , making this architecture a serious contender for scalable quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "this scheme encodes qubits as defects in a three dimensional cluster state , constructing the necessary qubit gates via topological operations on the surface of the code .",
    "a remarkable aspect of these 3d topological cluster states is their resilience to loss , with estimates that they could tolerate a located loss error as high as @xmath5  @xcite , and may even be able to recover from simultaneous computational basis and located loss errors  @xcite .",
    "the bare requirements a physical system must posses in order to implement topological cluster state computation are  @xcite : ( i ) state preparations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; ( ii ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 basis measurements ; ( iii ) the csign entangling gate .",
    "an implementation with optical systems has been proposed  @xcite based on integrated optics and in - line non - linear elements in the form of single atom cavity electro - dynamics , showing that with so called photonic modules , large scale topological cluster state computation could in principle be implemented .",
    "an alternate approach is to move all non - linearities off - line , using techniques of linear optical quantum computing ( loqc )  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately loqc with photonic qubits involves massive amounts of resource recycling , which would hugely complicate the optical circuit .",
    "surprisingly , an alternate loqc scheme based on coherent - state logic exists  @xcite which requires no recycling of resource states . in this paper",
    ", we consider the construction of 3d topological cluster states using such a coherent state logic , building on a ballistic type of linear optical csign gate  @xcite .",
    "the ballistic nature of this scheme makes it an ideal candidate for implementation with integrated linear optical quantum circuits  @xcite , since , as we will show , given the appropriate integrated optical wave - guide , this scheme is only in principle limited by the construction of the initial qubits .",
    "the use of coherent states for universal quantum computation was first proposed by ralph  _ et al._@xcite , where qubits were encoded as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , requiring bell state measurements for teleportation and a resource of cat states of the form @xmath10 .",
    "since the qubits were only approximately orthogonal , with @xmath11 , sufficiently large cat states were required for this scheme to be viable .",
    "however , the construction of large optical cat states in the laboratory is difficult , the largest cat states created to date via ancilla assisted two photon subtracted squeezed vacuum  @xcite have an average number of photons of @xmath12 with a fidelity of @xmath13 , while initial experiments  @xcite with three photon subtracted squeezed vacuum suggest that cat states with an average photon number as high as @xmath14 could be produced .",
    "though , even with the hurdle of constructing large amplitude cat states , quantum computation with coherent state logic may still be competitive with other optical quantum computation schemes , since the success probability for the basic gates is quite high and coherent state qubit teleportation is deterministic . a recent extension to this coherent state computation scheme by lund  _ et al . _",

    "[ sec : teleportation ] , we make use of teleporation to _ clean up _ the cluster states built from the basic scheme , showing that we can produce 3d cluster states from low amplitude cat states with arbitrarily high fidelity , albeit at the expense of moving away from the completely ballistic nature of the basic csign gate and introducing a success probability . in section  [ sec :",

    "we have shown that the ballistic construction of 3d topological cluster states with coherent logic qubits is possible provided the initial cat states are large enough . since the entangling gates for this scheme only involve passive linear optical elements , the use of integrated quantum optical circuits would be ideally suited to implement this scheme .",
    "we found that cat states with an average number of photons @xmath24 ( @xmath20 ) gave an error rate per qubit for the five qubit star cluster state less than @xmath4 , a computational error fault tolerant threshold that is believed the 3d topological cluster states will satisfy .",
    "we have also shown that teleportation could be used to _ clean up _ the cluster states produced from ballistic gates , and that teleportation might provide a method to trade - off computational basis errors for located loss errors .",
    "preliminary results for the teleportation of two qubit cluster states suggests that initial cat states with an amplitude of @xmath137 ( an average photon number of @xmath138 ) would result in a combined located loss error rate and computational basis error rate that is below an optimistic threshold for 3d topological cluster state codes .",
    "in this paper we have assumed that all errors arise from the 3d cluster state construction in the form of computational basis errors via the ballistic csign gate and located loss errors via teleportations to clean up the ballistic csign gate . in reality",
    "there will be other sources of error , such as measurement errors , errors resulting from actual computation and storage errors .",
    "in addition to this , the first physical requirement for topological cluster state computation , the need for state preparations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , still needs to be addressed for coherent state logic ."
