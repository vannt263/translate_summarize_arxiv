    "it is generally accepted that particle growth in dusty , circumstellar discs is hierarchical , eventually forming planetesimals that are the building blocks of planets @xcite .",
    "there is reasonable understanding of building small particles , but forming planetesimals from these particles remains mired in controversy .",
    "the initial stage of growth probably proceeds through the nucleation of sub - micron - sized dust grains from the primordial nebula , which then form the monomers of fractal dust aggregates up to @xmath0 mm to @xmath1 cm sizes in @xmath3 yrs , beyond which growth is stalled by collisional bouncing and fragmentation @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the particle dynamics and coagulation are described by brownian motion and van der waals forces .",
    "one of the best astrophysical pieces of evidence for grain growth to these sizes is the detection of 3.5 cm dust emission from the classical t tauri star tw hya ( age @xmath410 myr ) , located 56 pc away , which has a face - on circumstellar disc of radius 225 au @xcite .    in standard models of protoplanetary discs ,",
    "the gas pressure decreases radially outward .",
    "gas in the disc then moves at sub - keplerian speeds .",
    "solid particles on keplerian orbits experience a `` head wind '' with a velocity @xmath5 cm s@xmath6  this head wind drags @xmath1 cm- to @xmath0 m - sized particles into the central star on time scales of @xmath1100 years @xcite . these time scales are much shorter than the characteristic time scale for these particles to collide and grow into larger particles that are unaffected by the head wind .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that this difficulty can be circumvented by dust settling into the midplane of the disc and triggering gravitational instability , but @xcite pointed out that turbulence generated by the settling impedes the process .",
    "long - lived structures in the gas are a possible way of concentrating particles with sizes @xmath0 mm to @xmath1 cm and growing them to larger sizes .",
    "such structures are usually high - pressure regions in the gas that are capable of concentrating particles , which is a manifestation of bernoulli s principle @xcite .",

    "there are conceivable locations where the flow is turbulent and quasi-2d .",
    "an attractive feature of turbulent , 2d , hydrodynamic flows is that the fluid robustly self - organizes into large , coherent , long - lived vortices amidst a backdrop of small eddies without a need to invoke special initial conditions @xcite .",
    "such a property arises from the fact that the so - called `` vortex - stretching term '' in the vorticity equation is absent in 2d , thereby allowing an inverse cascade of energy ( and forward cascade of enstrophy ) .",
    "turbulence thus becomes a friend and not a foe . if protoplanetary discs are capable of producing turbulent , quasi-2d flows , then these may seed large - scale vortices that may survive for many orbital time scales .",

    "equation ( [ eq : settle ] ) is effectively the _ minimum _ time for the particles to settle , as vertical mixing may hold the particles aloft .",

    "small particles may grow up to some maximum particle size , typically @xmath56 cm , before starting to drift inward .",
    "we wish to show that vortices are capable of capturing particles in this size range as they drift radially inward through the disc .",

    "larger particles with @xmath65 1 m grow on timescales ( @xmath4 yr ) comparable to their drift times . thus , producing particles much larger than 1 m requires an environment to concentrate small particles in regions of larger local surface density where they can grow into much larger planetesimals which are safe from radial drift .",

    "keplerian shear inhibits the formation of circular structures larger than the shear length scale @xcite , @xmath74 circular vortices forming at scales @xmath75 get elongated in the azimuthal direction , which allows them to survive longer .",
    "these estimates for @xmath76 and @xmath77 show that vortices are large - scale phenomena with length scales @xmath78 .    in 3d",
    ", vortices are generally subjected to hydrodynamic instabilities that may destroy them on time scales shorter than @xmath72 ( see  [ sect : discussion ] ) . in 2d",
    ", vortices may live for many dynamical times due to the absence of the vortex trapping term in the vorticity equation .",
    "an inverse energy cascade exists in 2d turbulence , allowing large - scale vortices to emerge naturally from self - organization of the fluid @xcite .",
    "it is therefore much easier to make statements about vortices in 2d .",
    "the figure of merit for whether a fluid flow is 2d or 3d is the froude number , which is a measure of how rapidly a fluid element responds , against the vortex flow , when vertically displaced in a convectively stable fluid layer . at a given vertical height @xmath79 in the disc ,",
    "the fluid layer is effectively 2d if the froude number is less than unity @xcite .",
    "it depends on the ratio of two quantities : the buoyancy time scale @xmath80 and the rotational period of the gas around the vortex @xmath81 . assuming vertical isothermality for simplicity",

    "the flow is 3d .",
    "a couple of vertical scale heights or more from the mid - plane , however , the flow already becomes quasi-2d  any turbulence generated in these fluid layers will inevitably seed vortices , but we again note that such off - midplane vortices are not seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the forces acting on a particle crossing a vortex . by seeking solutions of the form , @xmath86 where @xmath87 are the cartesian coordinates of the particle with the origin centered on the vortex",
    ", he was able to show that @xmath88 and @xmath89  the particles follow ellipses of aspect ratio @xmath90 and move with angular velocity @xmath91 .",
    "the eccentricity of the ellipse is @xmath92 .",
    "the combined effect of the coriolis force and drag make the particles drift towards the vortex center on a time scale : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the friction coefficient which we will describe shortly .",
    "the preceding expressions were derived by @xcite under the assumption that the particle motion within the vortex is deterministic , which becomes invalid if the vortex cores become strongly turbulent @xcite .",
    "since @xmath95 minimizes the capture time @xcite , we will adopt this value for the rest of the paper whenever necessary and note that the numerical coefficients in equation ( [ eq : tcap ] ) are both 8/3 .",
    "the capture time depends on particle size and the properties of the gas through the friction coefficient @xmath94 . denoting the mean free path of the gas as @xmath96 cm",
    ", particles are in the epstein ( stokes ) regime when @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for `` small '' particles coupled closely to the gas , the transition from the epstein regime to the stokes regime occurs at a disc radius @xmath99 ( see  3 ) .",
    "thus , we write the friction coefficient as @xcite , @xmath100 solving for the vortex structure within the disc then requires specifying a disc model that in turn specifies @xmath60 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 as functions of @xmath8 and/or @xmath11 , which we will explore in the subsequent sections (  [ sect : static ] ,  [ sect : viscous ] and  [ sect : irradiated ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath103 is the commonly - used `` stokes number '' . if @xmath104 , the particle is small and tightly coupled to the gas , implying that it is unable to be trapped at the centre of the vortex . if @xmath105 , the particle is large and does not `` see '' the vortex .",
    "hence , as already noted by @xcite and simulated by @xcite , vortices tend to `` pick out '' particles of a certain size , i.e. , @xmath106 , such that capture occurs within an orbital period , @xmath107 .",
    "these particles are also the ones that attempt to settle towards the mid - plane of the disc after growing to large sizes via coagulation .",
    "this aerodynamic sorting of the particles inside vortices is consistent with evidence that meteorites in our solar system are composed of chondrules of a similar size @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the expression for @xmath94 in the stokes regime only holds when the particle reynolds number is less than unity .",
    "equivalently , this requires @xmath108 since @xmath109 for the discs we are considering , we expect the condition in equation ( [ eq : stokes_condition ] ) to be satisified .",
    "finally , gravitational instability may be triggered if the concentrated mass density within the vortices exceeds the _ effective _ roche density , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a dimensionless factor accounting for the delay of gravitational collapse due to gas pressure .",
    "setting @xmath112 gives the traditional mass density threshold for gravitational instability , which is about two orders of magnitude larger than the characteristic mass density of the gas within the nebula , @xmath113 g @xmath114 .",
    "traditionally , gravitational collapse occurs within @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the mass density of the self - gravitating clump created by gravitational instability . among others ,",
    "@xcite point out that gas pressure and turbulence act to delay the onset of collapse , analogous to the role of ambipolar diffusion in star formation , estimate @xmath117 and show instead that gravitational collapse occurs on a timescale , @xmath118    in summary , small particles ( @xmath119 m ) , strongly coupled to the gas , coagulate rapidly and attempt to settle to the midplane of the disc .",
    "particles approaching @xmath0 mm to @xmath1 cm in size experience radial drag forces that direct them into the star .",
    "vortex capture occurs on a dynamical time scale  large - scale vortices therefore provide a way to trap these particles before they drift into the star .",
    "the enriched particle density within the vortices then enhances particle growth @xcite .",
    "growing particles remain trapped within the vortices until they are large enough to decouple from the gas , when radial drag is negligible .",
    "thus , vortices provide a natural way for small particles to grow into larger ones before they are dragged into the central star .",
    "this mechanism for trapping particles within the disc is an interesting alternative to streaming instabilities , the clumping of particles in a gaseous disc with pressure support ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in streaming instabilities , efficient clumping requires dust - to - gas ratios of order unity near the disc midplane .",
    "vortices require no special dust - to - gas ratio . _",
    "hence , vortices above the disc midplane and streaming instabilities in the midplane may provide complementary mechanisms for forming large planetesimals from small particles . _    to examine whether vortices can trap particles in protoplanetary discs , we consider several accretion disc models . to develop an initial picture of this process , we start with a standard , static protostellar disc where the surface density and temperature decrease radially outward . to explore a broad range of discs , we consider masses and surface density gradients consistent with observations of discs surrounding young stars .",
    "our results suggest that four vortex zones generically exist in discs with surface density and temperature profiles that are decreasing , power - law functions of @xmath8 .",
    "two of these vortex zones form an annulus at intermediate distances from the star , within which particles are tightly coupled to the gas and are considered `` small . ''",
    "vortex capture of particles is optimal near and at the boundaries of this annulus . to explore the generality of these results ,",
    "we then consider two models of evolving discs : a completely viscous disc (  [ sect : viscous ] ) and an irradiated , viscous disc (  [ sect : irradiated ] ) .",
    "our analyses suggests that these basic conclusions are unaffected by the choice of disc model .",
    "determining the locations where vortices trap particles in gaseous discs involves specifying the surface density and temperature profiles . in models of the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ; @xcite ) , @xmath120 at @xmath121 au , the normalization values typically chosen are @xmath122 g @xmath123 and @xmath124 k. in this section , we assume @xmath125 , i.e.",

    "submillimetre studies of young stellar objects show that the surface density drops off more slowly than predicted by the @xmath130 mmsn model , and that the distribution of disc masses is roughly log - normal with a typical mass @xmath135 @xcite .",

    "inferred disc outer radii from partially - resolved submillimetre images of these @xmath0 myr - old objects are typically @xmath142 au ; a viscous disc model with @xmath143 matches the median spectral energy and surface brightness distributions @xcite .",
    "many discs with @xmath144 are dynamically unstable and may represent transient states that are less relevant for the vortex capture of particles , so we will focus on @xmath145 discs .    specifying the surface density and temperature profiles yields the vertical scale height and mean free path , @xmath146 where @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 is the collision cross section of a hydrogen molecule and @xmath150 . for @xmath151 , @xmath152 au and @xmath153 cm .",

    "the salient points of our study are :    1 .",
    "if the surface density and effective temperature of protoplanetary discs are decreasing , power - law functions of the distance from the star , then all discs contain four vortex zones for a fixed particle size ( figures [ fig : schematic ] and [ fig : mmsn ] ) .",
    "2 .   there is an annulus at intermediate distances from the star where small particles reside and may grow via coagulation .",
    "the size of this annulus decreases with time and also shrinks as the particles grow ( figure [ fig : distances ] ) .",
    "vortex capture is optimal near and at the boundaries of this annulus , and occurs within an orbital period .",
    "the optimal capture radii ( @xmath0 mm to @xmath1 cm ; figures [ fig : vis ] and [ fig : rad ] ) of particles are comparable to or smaller than the sizes of particles ( @xmath0 m ) that drift fastest through the protoplanetary disc . the enhanced particle concentration within the vortices may make the characteristic time for particle growth shorter than that for radial drift .",
    "4 .   vortices in older discs prefer to capture smaller particles , a phenomenon we term `` vortex aging '' ( figures [ fig : vis ] and [ fig : rad ] ) .",
    "if coagulation between sub - micron particles mixed with the gas can only produce small ( @xmath314 mm ) particles , then vortices can capture them throughout the lifetime of the disc .",
    "however , if coagulation manufactures larger ( @xmath1 cm ) particles when the disc is young , vortices must form early to capture them .",
    "this metaphorical dance between coagulation and vortex aging determines how efficiently vortices help the disc to retain its mass in solids .",
    "more viscous , more dust - opaque and/or less massive discs can have vortices that trap a broader range of particle sizes throughout the lifetime of the disc . while the coagulation of grains with sizes @xmath314 mm needs to be more in synch with the evolution of more massive discs , such discs are also expected to grow grains to larger sizes more rapidly",
    "the maximum size of particle that can be trapped by vortices is @xmath1 cm , independent of disc model and weakly dependent on stellar , disc and dust properties .",
    "discs where particles settle to the midplane ( within @xmath315 yr ) and are sequestered in vortices have upper limits to their masses ( @xmath316 ) that are consistent with those of most observed discs .",
    "if vertical mixing is present ( e.g. , via turbulence ) , the maximum masses can be much smaller .",
    "many open questions remain concerning the microphysics of vortices . while we have shown that particles can be gathered by vortices , the outcome of these captures is uncertain .",
    "vortices may concentrate enough mass to enhance collisions rates by an order of magnitude ( or more ) or to trigger local gravitational instabilities @xcite .",
    "both paths leads to the formation of self - gravitating objects which will not drift through the disc .",
    "however , at least some of the published simulations are run in 2d ( e.g. , @xcite )  in the absence of viscosity or particles , such vortices live forever , implying that the mass of the planetesimal , embyro or planet formed depends either on the time the simulation is executed or the breakup of the vortex by the non - linear feedback of the concentrated particles .",
    "it is more likely that if the centres of vortices are relatively quiescent , they then serve as nurseries for coagulation to occur between somewhat larger particles .",
    "vortex formation is also uncertain .",
    "@xcite show that the subcritical baroclinic instability ( sbi ) is a plausible way of seeding vortices .",
    "discs develop this _ non - linear _ instability when they are ( radially ) convectively unstable , have non - negligible thermal diffusion , and are subjected to finite vorticity perturbations ( @xmath317 ) .",
    "the associated reynolds number for the shearing box simulations in this study is @xmath318 ; because the threshold vorticity amplitude for invoking the sbi decreases with increasing @xmath319 , they speculate that the threshold amplitude could be very small ( and possibly sub - sonic ) in realistic discs .",
    "another possibility for generating vortices is via the ( linear ) rossby wave instability @xcite , which was invoked by @xcite to consider 2d vortices in protoplanetary discs .",
    "@xcite found that the formation of vortices via the rossby wave instability critically depends on the amplitude and width of an initial density bump placed within the disc .",
    "this bump appears to be most unstable to perturbations with an azimuthal mode number of 5 ( i.e. , `` @xmath320 '' perturbations ) .",
    "@xcite performed 3d simulations of stratified discs and concluded that strong and persistent vortices emerge out of the flow via the rossby wave instability . @xcite",
    "have noted that rossby waves are only supported by flows with non - vanishing vorticity gradients , implying that they are relevant mostly in incompressible , inviscid flows .",
    "the subject of vortex survivability is mired in deeper controversy .",
    "@xcite subject vortices embedded in a shearing sheet to 3d perturbations ; only vortices with @xmath321 survive the elliptical instability in unstratified discs .",
    "this stability region vanishes when stratified discs are considered . by contrast , @xcite asserts that weak vortices ( @xmath322 ) can survive in quasi-2d flows .",
    "@xcite find that vortices develop bursts of turbulence in their cores before surviving as weaker vortices ; the sbi amplifies the vortices and the cycle restarts .",
    "if turbulent vortex cores are generic and ubiquitous phenomena in realistic discs , then they may pose a setback to using vortices as mechanisms for concentrating particles .",
    "many collective properties of vortices in turbulent , 2d , hydrodynamic flows remain poorly understood . among these",
    "is the `` universal decay theory '' , which is the empirical observation that the vortex density , radius , velocity , mean separation between vortices , enstrophy and kurtosis can be approximated by power laws of time parametrized by a single parameter  a first - principles explanation is still being sought @xcite .",
    "statistical theories predict vortices to always ultimately merge , in contrast to experiments that show that above a critical separation , a pair of vortices may remain separated for many dynamical times @xcite .    despite these uncertainties , vortices provide an interesting alternative to streaming instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which require dust - to - gas ratios to approach of order unity ( presumably near the disc midplane ) .",
    "vortices require no special dust - to - gas ratio to trap particles and may exist off the disc midplane . in both cases , particles with @xmath106",
    "are captured and the capture size decreases as the gas in the disc dissipates .",
    "therefore , vortex trapping and streaming instabilities may provide complementary mechanisms for particle concentration and/or growth .",
    "a key question to study and explore is the size distribution of planetesimals produced by each mechanism , since this might have an impact on the types of ( exo)planets produced in a system .",
    "preliminary analyses of the initial size distribution of solar system planetesimals suggest a broad range of values , ranging from @xmath010 km @xcite to @xmath3231000 km @xcite .",
    "our study makes falsifiable predictions about the size of particles concentrated as a function of distance from the star .",
    "particles smaller or larger than the optimal radii for vortex capture will be uniformly distributed throughout the disc , while those with sizes @xmath0 mm to @xmath1 cm will be concentrated near their respective transitional distances @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( figure [ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "if particle concentration leads to the growth of larger particles , these particles will then decouple from the gas and migrate out of the vortices",
    ". the decoupling will be stronger in the inner regions of the disc as @xmath324 ( instead of @xmath325 in the outer regions ) . in our solar system",
    ", the smallest constituents ( chondrules ) of @xmath323 km - sized asteroids have sizes @xmath0 mm @xcite , comparable to the sizes of particles trapped by vortices .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) have pointed out that there is a spread of about 1 myr between the formation times of the oldest and youngest objects in the same meteorite , implying that particle growth was fairly inefficient .",
    "this inference is in turn consistent with the limited temporal windows for particle trapping implied by vortex aging .",
    "another interesting property of @xmath1100 km - sized asteroids is that many of them are formed from a physically and chemically homogeneous mix of particles of a similar size , consistent with the aerodynamic sorting property of vortices .    in extrasolar settings , observations characterizing grain opacity ( and hence grain growth ) in protoplanetary discs",
    "can quantify particle populations as functions of radial distance , but these are still nascent and have only been accomplished for a small number of objects , e.g. , hd 163296 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hypothesis that vortices serve as nurseries for particle growth will need to be tested by future infrared , submillimetre and centimetre observations of protoplanetary discs , and may lead to constraints on the time scales for grain coagulation ( figures [ fig : vis ] and [ fig : rad ] ) .",
    "for example , the _ atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , _ which operates at wavelengths between 0.3 and 3.6 mm , might be able to detect disc features associated with vortex capture .",
    "coagulation - fragmentation simulations can subsequently be performed to convert the observed fluxes and @xmath243 values into constraints on the grain properties ( e.g. , mass / size distribution , porosity ; @xcite ) .",
    "even if vortices do not survive long enough to create self - gravitating structures , they will certainly play a strong role in redistributing matter throughout the disc . whether the redistribution of matter by the vortices plays any significant role in the eventual formation of planetesimals",
    "is unknown .",
    "an implication of a size - dependent redistribution of matter is that if the amount of electric charge carried by a particle is proportional to its size , then charge separation in protoplanetary discs may be a fairly common phenomenon .",
    "our study has shown that if vortices form in protoplanetary discs , they are important in discs with typical masses and for particles that are likely to condense out of the protostellar nebula .",
    "the capture of particles also occurs at distances relevant to planet formation . with this study",
    ", we hope to ( re)ignite the debate in connecting the microphysics of vortices with the global properties of protoplanetary discs , as the first step towards understanding the _ efficiency _ of planetesimal  and eventually planet  formation .",

    "<S> a generic feature of discs with surface density and effective temperature profiles that are decreasing , power - law functions of radial distance is that four vortex zones exist for a fixed particle size . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , two of the zones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which small particles reside . </S>",
    "<S> particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time scale near and at the boundaries of this annulus . as the disc ages and the particles grow via coagulation , the size of the annulus shrinks . </S>",
    "<S> older discs prefer to capture smaller particles because the gas surface density decreases with time , a phenomenon we term `` vortex aging '' . </S>",
    "<S> more viscous , more dust - opaque and/or less massive discs can have vortices that age faster and trap a broader range of particle sizes throughout the lifetime of the disc . </S>",
    "<S> thus , how efficiently a disc retains its mass in solids depends on the relative time scales between coagulation and vortex aging . </S>",
    "<S> if vortices form in protoplanetary discs , they are important in discs with typical masses and for particles that are likely to condense out of the protostellar nebula . </S>",
    "<S> particle capture also occurs at distances relevant to planet formation . </S>",
    "<S> future infrared , submillimetre and centimetre observations of grain opacity as a function of radial distance will test the hypothesis that vortices serve as nurseries for particle growth in protoplanetary discs .    </S>",
