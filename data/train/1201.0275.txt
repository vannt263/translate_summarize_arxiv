    "cosmological and astronomical observations such as supernovae type ia observational data @xcite and wilkonson microwave anisotropic probe ( wmap ) @xcite imply that the universe is undergoing a period of accelerated expansion . since normal matter can not give rise to accelerated expansion of the universe , scientists came up with a solution which expresses that this expansion is a result of an ambiguous fluid named dark energy @xcite .",
    "+ the theoretical and experimental analysis suggest that the universe consist of @xmath1 dark energy , @xmath2 cold dark matter ( cdm ) , and remnant matter is baryons @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the nature and origin of dark energy are ambiguous up to now , but people have proposed some candidates to describe dark energy . amongst the various candidates of dark energy to describe accelerated expansion of the universe , cosmological constant ( vacuum energy ) , @xmath3 , with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath4 is located in central position . however , as it is well known , the cosmological constant proposal has two famous problems , fine - tuning problem and the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "some other of dark energy models suggest that dark energy component can treat as scalar field with dynamical eos . in this scenario",
    "the evolution of the field is very slow , so that kinetic energy density is less than the potential energy density , and this give us a negative pressure , responsible to the cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "some of scalar field models are as chameleon field @xcite , quintessence ( q - field ) @xcite , and phantom . in the phantom field scenario ,",
    "the parameter of eos is as @xmath0 , due to existence of a negative kinetic energy density of scalar field .",
    "it is well known that the phantom dark energy model suffers from two kind of problems , `` big bang '' singularity and `` big rip '' singularity , where big bang is related to initial epoch of universe and big rip is related to a finite future singularity .",
    "since the space - time singularities are invidious for theorists , models that avoid these singularities are attractive .",
    "one of these models names cyclic universe which have received huge attention @xcite .",
    "presence of @xmath5 term with a negative sign in friedmann equation ( which is used at studying cyclic universe ) is an effective way to eliminate these singularities . in the cyclic universe scenario , where is based on the phantom dark energy model",
    ", the universe oscillates through a series of expansion and contraction .",
    "universe in this scenario has a very high energy density at beginning an ending of the expansion , so quantum gravity can not be ignored in these stages @xcite",
    ". this evolution can be result from the modified friedmann equation in the loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) . in lqc",
    ", the friedmann equation has been modified to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hubble parameter , @xmath8 is the reduced planck mass ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the total of energy density , @xmath11 is the critical energy density as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the dimensionless barbero - immirizi parameter @xcite .",
    "we notice , this correction can solve the singularity problems as follow , when the total energy density reaches the critical density , the universe reaches the maximum at the end of expansion that is called `` turnaround point '' , and universe arrives at smallest size at the end of contraction , then we have a bounce there @xcite .",
    "we emphasize the idea of cyclic universe was first introduced by tolman @xcite .",
    "+ an interesting attempt for probing the nature of dark energy , in the framework of quantum gravity , is the holographic dark energy ( hde ) . in the hde model ,",
    "dark energy is a dynamical evolving vacuum energy density that can satisfy the phantom behavior .",
    "authors of @xcite have investigated the cyclic universe by hde ( and some interesting work about hde have been done @xcite .",
    "another attractive model to describe the nature of dark energy , within the framework of a fundamental theory originating from some considerations of the feature of quantum gravity theory , is called agegraphic dark energy ( ade ) model @xcite .",
    "the ade assumes that the dark energy comes from the universe components fluctuation such as space - time and matter fluctuation ( for further discussion we refer the reader to @xcite . in this model , the age of universe",
    "is taken as the length measure instead of the horizon distance , therefore the causality problem which appears in the hde model can be avoided .",
    "the ade model suffers from the difficulty to describe the matter dominant epoch .",
    "the authors of @xcite have introduced a new mechanism to overcome that problem , which it is called new agegraphic dark energy ( nade ) model , and its energy density is defined by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is introduced to parameterized some uncertainties and @xmath17 is conformal time and can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is scale factor and @xmath7 is well - known as hubble parameter .",
    "cyclic model of universe , due to avoiding singularity , and nade , due to estimating a good approximate of dark energy value and solving causality problem of hde , have received huge interest . in previous works , like @xcite",
    ", it was only mentioned that interaction nade can produce phantom , however it was not explained that if nade can produce cyclic universe and how the quantities like dark energy density parameter , equation of state parameter , and deceleration parameter behave in cyclic universe by taking nade as component of dark energy . in this work we motivated to take nade as dark energy and",
    "investigate universe evolution in cyclic model .",
    "if it is able to stand in phantom area , it may produce cyclic universe , however it is not all of story .",
    "although , presence of this type of dark energy displays an accelerated universe , but the most important thing in cyclic universe is that , after a while , the universe should enter in a deceleration area and recontract in turnaround point .",
    "in this step , we focus on high energy regime . certainly the quadratic term of energy density in the friedmann equation can not be ignored , this term can play a very impressive role in the evolution of universe .",
    "the modified friedmann equation is as    @xmath20    where @xmath10 is a combination of dark energy density , @xmath21 , and matter density , @xmath22 . for dark energy dominant in high energy regime ,",
    "the above relation can be rewritten as    @xmath23    so , according to this relation the parameter of dark energy may be estimated as    @xmath24    @xmath25 is always larger than one , and it can be very large when the universe approaches to the turnaround point .",
    "however note that , since we have @xmath22 , although it is very small , @xmath25 can not be infinite .",
    "this small value of @xmath22 does not allow @xmath21 to reach the exact value of @xmath11 , then the presence of @xmath22 can prevent the infinite value of @xmath25 .",
    "+ if we assume there is no interaction between these two components of the universe , conservation equation can be written as    @xmath26    by taking ade , which is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes time , as dark energy component of universe , @xmath29 is obtained as    @xmath30    also , if we replace nade instead of ade , we arrive at same result but only scale factor , @xmath19 , should be added in the denominator of second term on the right hand of relation ( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "since the latest term , in both case , is always positive @xmath29 never can be smaller than @xmath31 . since phantom type of dark energy is requisite for cyclic universe ( phantom energy density is getting larger with increasing scale factor so the total energy density reaches the critical energy density in turnaround point and universe begins contraction ) , selecting ade and nade , without interaction , as a component of dark energy in cyclic universe is not suitable @xcite .",
    "assumption of interaction between @xmath32 and @xmath21 may solve above problem . by including interaction ,",
    "the conservation equations are as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 indicates interaction .",
    "@xmath34 is taken as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , which means there is transfer of energy from @xmath21 to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath34 as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 . setting ade",
    "as the component of dark energy gives us an @xmath29 as    @xmath39    @xmath25 is always larger than one , and it becomes very large at turnaround point , so for having @xmath40 , we should have @xmath41 .",
    "this predicts a large value for coupling constant @xmath42 , while it is in contrast to the obtained value of another papers such as @xcite .",
    "+ now , nade is taken as @xmath21 which that is the main case of this work . because we use conformal time @xmath17 instead of @xmath28",
    ", scale factor appear in relation ( [ 15 ] ) , namely    @xmath43    to have @xmath40 , the coupling constant @xmath42 should obey following relation    @xmath44    here , @xmath45 has been ignored because of @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath25 be in order of @xmath47 , we may obtain a convenient value for @xmath42 in order it could give us phantom dark energy in this regime .",
    "equation of state parameter of dark energy has been plotted versus the dimensionless quantity @xmath38 , for three different value of interaction coupling constant . , width=302 ]     in fig.1 @xmath29 parameter has been plotted versus @xmath38 , for three different value of interaction coupling constant . in expansion phase , by passing time , the quantity @xmath45 decreases and makes @xmath29 larger . since it still stands in phantom range , larger value of @xmath29 shows that dark energy density grows up slower ; in contrast to the contraction phase .",
    "also , having stronger interaction coupling causes smaller value for @xmath29 .    if @xmath25 be in order of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , equation ( [ 17 ] ) can be valid in good approximation .",
    "now suppose @xmath25 is in order of @xmath47 , for instance @xmath50 . from equation (",
    "[ 17 ] ) we have @xmath51 , and by taking the value of @xcite for @xmath42 , namely @xmath52 , we obtain the value of @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "+ now , we want to obtain differential equation for @xmath25 . in the nade , @xmath21 is given as    @xmath55    from the definition of dark energy density parameter , namely @xmath56 , the differential equation for @xmath25 is acquired as    @xmath57    where prime denote derivative with respect to @xmath58 . taking the time derivative of modified friedmann equation , and substituting that in the above equation , we obtain    @xmath59    since , in the high energy regime , @xmath60 can be ignored against to @xmath25 , therefore one can estimate    @xmath61    ( for driving above equation we have used @xmath62 , see ref.@xcite . the differential equation , which governs the nade evolution of universe in high energy regime , can be attained as    @xmath63    with attention to ( [ 17 ] ) , it is clearly shown that @xmath64 is positive .",
    "so one can realize that when the universe is growing up ( decreasing ) @xmath65 is positive ( negative ) which it displays that dark energy density parameter is increasing ( decreasing ) by passing time . by passing the universe from turnaround point ,",
    "@xmath25 decreases and puts the universe in low energy regime .",
    "another useful cosmological parameter is deceleration parameter which can tell us if the expansion of universe is accelerating or not .",
    "deceleration parameter is given by    @xmath66    substituting @xmath67 term in the above relation , we arrive at    @xmath68    ( expansion epoch ) deceleration parameter , @xmath69 , has been plotted versus the dimensionless quantity @xmath70 , for three different value of interaction coupling constant . , width=302 ]    ( contraction epoch ) deceleration parameter , @xmath69 , has been plotted versus the dimensionless quantity @xmath71 , for three different value of interaction coupling constant . ,",
    "width=302 ]     deceleration parameter has been plotted versus the dimensionless quantity @xmath72 for expansion and contraction epoch of universe evolution in fig.2 . and",
    "fig.3 . respectively",
    "( with attention to this fact that @xmath29 stands in phantom range ) . in the plots three different values for @xmath42 are taken as @xmath73 ; which displays the strange of interaction between matter and dark energy .",
    "shows that @xmath69 has negative values that it means the universe is in an acceleration phase and getting larger .",
    "since there is a positive value for hubble parameter , @xmath25 increases too . by passing time and increasing dark energy density , @xmath69 approaches to zero ,",
    "therefore the universe moves from acceleration phase to deceleration phase .",
    "however since we are in expansion epoch of universe evolution , @xmath25 is still getting larger which causes @xmath69 grows rapidly ( and as we expect larger values of interaction coupling constant makes @xmath69 to grow up faster ) . reaching energy density to critical energy density",
    ", the universe is forced to stop expansion and change its evolution direction and start to contract in turnaround point . in contraction epoch",
    ", the universe is getting smaller more and more with a large value of @xmath69 at the beginning of contraction , as it has been shown in fig.3 .",
    "the hubble parameter has negative values and @xmath25 decreases therefore dark energy density is diluted .",
    "@xmath69 again takes negative values , however the universe continue to contract and decrease more and more , until it moves to low energy regime and dark energy dilute enough in which matter and radiation become dominant .    up to now , from above discussion in high energy regime",
    ", we found out that nade can satisfy a phantom fluid for cyclic scenario .",
    "however this is not at all our universe , there is also regime related to the low energy , where @xmath74 . at this regime",
    "we have the usual friedmann equation for universe , namely @xmath75 by defining the energy density parameters in the form of    @xmath76    where @xmath77 refer to matter and dark energy .",
    "one can rearrange the standard friedmann equation as @xmath78 , from this relation we find out the maximum value of @xmath79 is one .",
    "now , nade is taken as dark energy component with interaction with matter , so from conservation equation related to the dark energy and with the help of above friedmann equation , one obtain @xmath29 as    @xmath80    maximum value of dark energy density parameter , namely @xmath81 is one and also when the scale factor is large enough to make the second term on the right hand of above relation small in which @xmath29 stands in phantom range .",
    "the sort of dark energy as a component of universe fluid has been determined , so we want to be aware about the evolution of universe in this stage . + the deceleration parameter is expressed as    @xmath82    so in the earlier time when @xmath81 converge to zero ( and @xmath83 converge to one ) the deceleration parameter is as @xmath84 for @xmath85 , and @xmath86 for @xmath87 that indicates a deceleration universe . whereas in the late time when @xmath81 approaches to one , the deceleration parameter has negative sign that introduces an acceleration universe .",
    "so far , we investigated whether nade can produce a phantom dark energy for cyclic universe .",
    "now , it can be valuable to study validity of generalized second law of thermodynamic in the model and consider which condition can satisfy generalized second law .",
    "since loop quantum gravity correction enters in friedmann equation which plays an important role in the evolution of universe , especially in high energy regime , it is not suitable one straightforward extends the standard treatment of thermodynamic . for this reason we use the result of @xcite",
    "which thermodynamic has been investigated in loop quantum cosmology there .",
    "the authors of @xcite have performed their work by taking a dynamical apparent horizon as universe horizon .",
    "it has been demonstrated that one can have @xmath88 however note that , here @xmath89 which @xmath90 is effective energy density and @xmath91 ( in which @xmath92 is effective pressure ) . the relation can be very useful in this step of the work . like @xcite , we take apparent horizon @xmath93 from considering the validity of generalized second law , we should sum variation of entropy for both of horizon and fluid inside the horizon .",
    "the horizon entropy    @xmath94    for the relation ( [ 20 ] ) , the entropy variation of fluid inside the horizon can be acquired as    @xmath95    note that , there is an equilibrium between the temperature of horizon and matter inside the horizon . using modified friedmann equation and conservation relations and also with the help of the definition of horizon and energy density parameters ,",
    "the total entropy variation is resulted as    @xmath96    now , we turn our attention to the high energy regime where @xmath97 can be ignored against to the larg value of @xmath25 .",
    "define @xmath98 in which @xmath99 , then the total entropy variation is reorganized as    @xmath100    where @xmath101 . if @xmath102 , for making valid the second law , there should be    @xmath103 however , if @xmath104 , the total entropy variation is always positive .",
    "+ in low energy density , @xmath25 tends to @xmath81 where @xmath105 , also @xmath53 approaches to zero , so one arrives at    @xmath106    where @xmath107 . in radiation and matter",
    "dominant , where @xmath81 converges to zero , @xmath108 is positive and we should have    @xmath109 to generalized second law be valid . in radiation and matter dominant @xmath110 is equal to @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively .",
    "this expresses that the right term is positive .",
    "passing time , the dark energy eventually dominates and @xmath81 increases to one , so @xmath113 .",
    "the generalized second law leads us to the below condition for temperature @xmath114 and since @xmath108 is negative we can have a positive value for temperature . so the generalized second law of thermodynamics can be valid , and",
    "it can be a confirmation for the model .",
    "during this work , in brief , it was shown that both of ade and nade , without interaction with matter in both high and low energy regime , can not satisfy phantom dark energy which it is a necessary condition for cyclic universe scenario .",
    "so , as it was the main goal of the work , an interaction between the fluid components of the universe was supposed . at first step , we turned our attention to the high energy regime , and we realized that , in ade case for providing a phantom fluid there must be a large value for coupling constant @xmath42 which it is not compatible with the results of previous works , but nade can produce a phantom fluid for cyclic universe while dark energy density parameter , namely @xmath25 , behaves as @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "it was explained that , in expansion phase , equation of state parameter of dark energy increases by decreasing @xmath38 . however in contraction phase , the quantity @xmath45 increases , so @xmath29 decreases . in contraction phase with attention to this",
    "fact that dark energy stands in phantom range , smaller values of @xmath29 express that dark energy density decreases faster and let universe to enter matter dominant phase",
    ". moreover larger value of interaction coupling constant produce smaller valus for @xmath29 .",
    "+ considering differential equation of @xmath25 exhibited that after passing the universe from turnaround point ( in contracting phase ) , @xmath25 decreases and after a while the universe is putted in low energy regime , then matter and radiation are be allowed to be dominate . by computing deceleration parameter ,",
    "it was found out that there is negative values for @xmath69 which shows that the universe is in an accelerated expansion phase .",
    "increasing dark energy density enters @xmath69 in positive area and it is made larger .",
    "then , the universe moves from an accelerated expansion phase to a deceleration phase and it is slowing down until it stops expansion and starts contraction in turnaround point .",
    "so it is realized that the model is able to create a deceleration phase and start contraction after an accelerated expansion phase . in next step , we investigated the low energy regime of universe where it can be possible to ignore loop quantum correction in friedmann relation and go back to usual form .",
    "investigation shew us that , in low energy regime , @xmath29 stands in phantom range .",
    "also , considering deceleration parameter displayed that universe expansion decelerates in both of matter and radiation dominant , where @xmath81 is small enough , and accelerates by increasing @xmath81 toward one . in the last part of the work",
    ", we studied the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamic in both case of high and low energy .",
    "in high energy it was determined that when @xmath115 the total entropy variation is always positive . at low energy , we shew that to make valid the law , a bound for temperature is imposed .",
