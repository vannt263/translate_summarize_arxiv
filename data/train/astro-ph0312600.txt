    "the excellent soft x - ray response of rosat pointed and all - sky observations @xcite have led to the discovery of eight thermally emitting objects ( listed in table  [ table:1 ] ) having roughly the size of a neutron star but showing not any radio emission@xcite .    among these objects rxj1856.5 - 3754 is the brightest and thus best qualified for detailed studies aiming at a determination of its radius , surface gravity and gravitational redshift by means of x - ray spectroscopy , allowing to determine the equation of state of matter at supranuclear densities . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate primarily on this object and first summarize the main observational facts .",
    "rxj1856.5@xmath03754 ( henceforth rxj1856 ) was discovered serendipitously in a rosat field by walter et al.@xcite . using",
    "the hst walter & matthews@xcite identified the x - ray source with a faint blue star ( v@xmath426mag ) .",
    "its distance and proper motion were measured with hst as well , yielding ( 117@xmath512)pc and 0.33arcsec / year , respectively @xcite . with the vlt van kerkwijk & kulkarni@xcite found a faint nebula surrounding the point source which has a cometary - like geometry with a 25 \" tail extending along the direction of motion .",
    "none of the x - ray observations revealed any variability on time scales up to ten years .",
    "the so far best upper limit of 1.3%(2@xmath6 ) on periodic variations in the range @xmath7@xmath050hz has been established by burwitz et al.@xcite using a xmm - newton epic - pn observation .",
    "chandra letg observations with high spectral resolution show a featureless spectrum that can be fit by a planckian spectrum with a temperature of 63@xmath53ev @xcite . compared with the optical spectrum which shows a rayleigh - jeans slope ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum is reduced by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the overall spectrum of the source has often been described by a two - temperature blackbody model e.g. @xcite .",
    "a large number of papers have been dealing with the nature of this compact object and the proposed interpretations include almost everything which has ever been discussed in this context , ranging from  normal  neutron stars with a stiff or soft equation of state over neutron stars having a quarks core to bare strange quark stars . in this paper , we show that the observational data require a normal neutron star with a rather stiff equation of state .",
    "the lack of any significant spectral features in the letg spectrum excludes magnetic fields of ( 1.3@xmath07)@xmath210@xmath8 g ( for electrons ) and ( 0.2@xmath01.3)@xmath210@xmath9 g ( for protons ) , see burwitz et al .",
    "this leaves the possibility of a low magnetic field characteristic for millisecond pulsars or a high magnetic field typical for normal pulsars open .",
    "unfortunately , due to the absence of a periodicity the usual estimate of the magnetic field of rxj1856 based on the rotating dipole model is not possible . using phenomenological arguments based on the very small pulsed fraction in x - rays and on a comparison with other objects",
    "van kerkwijk & kulkarni @xcite have argued that the star has a relatively low magnetic field of a few 10@xmath8 g which may be marginally consistent with the absence of proton cyclotron lines .",
    "but this is not the only possibility .",
    "we estimate the magnetic field making use of the spin - down luminosity de / dt@xmath44@xmath210@xmath10erg / s required for powering the cometary - like emission nebula @xcite and of the age of the star ( t@xmath45@xmath210@xmath11 years ) inferred from its proper motion and the distance to its likely birthplace in the upper sco ob association @xcite : assuming as usual the validity of magnetic dipole braking we find a period of a @xmath41.8sec and a magnetic field strength of @xmath41.1@xmath210@xmath12 g .",
    "we emphasise that these figures are very similar to those of the second brightest object of this kind , the pulsating source rxj0720.4@xmath03125 ( henceforth rxj0720 ) whose spectral characteristics are also very similar to those of rxj1856 ( see below ) . while the estimate of de / dt may be considered as rather reliable , the age derived from the birthplace argument is not so certain .",
    "however , an age of t@xmath45@xmath210@xmath11years ( with an uncertainty of a factor of two ) is fully consistent with what we know empirically about the cooling of neutron stars .",
    "we therefore conclude that the magnetic field of rxj1856 is probably large , i.e. of the order of @xmath13 g. to support this , it will be important to exclude the alternative hypothesis of a millisecond pulsar @xcite by means of a high time resolution observation with xmm - newton which has already been approved .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     @xmath14period and temperature from xmm - newton data ( haberl et al .",
    "_ in preparation _ )",
    "the main puzzle of rxj1856 is the obser - vational fact that its x - ray spectrum is completely featureless .",
    "it has been pointed out by burwitz et al.@xcite that nonmagnetic photospheric spectra assuming a pure iron composition are incompatible with the measured spectrum because the predicted fe - l features are not detected with high significance .",
    "even a solar composition model with its small abundance of metals leads to unacceptable spectral fits .",
    "doppler smearing of the spectral lines due to fast rotation does not wash away completely the strongest spectral features @xcite . on the other hand hydrogen or helium photospheres",
    "can be excluded , because they over - predict the optical flux by a large factor @xcite .",
    "therefore any nonmagnetic photosphere can be firmly excluded .    as a remedy",
    "it has been proposed that the star has no atmosphere but a condensed matter surface @xcite .",
    "such a surface is expected to be reflective in the x - ray domain @xcite which could help to explain the low x - ray / optical flux ratio .",
    "condensation of surface matter requires low tem - peratures and strong magnetic fields . to condense hydrogen at a temperature of kt=63ev a magnetic field of 5@xmath15 g",
    "is required @xcite . for iron",
    "it is not clear whether a condensate can exist at all .",
    "according to lai@xcite the cohesive energy of iron is uncertain , but condensation may occur at 3@xmath16 g ( at kt=63ev ) while neuhauser et al.@xcite conclude that iron can not condensate .",
    "another problem is that the optical properties ( the reflectivity depending on photon energy , polarisation and magnetic field angle ) of a condensed matter surface have not been calculated taking into account the effects of atomic energy levels and of the solid state structure . simplified models which calculate the reflectivities of a highly magnetized , high density electron plasma have been performed by lenzen & trmper@xcite , brinkmann@xcite , zane et al.@xcite and turolla et al.@xcite .",
    "they yield x - ray reflectivities of typically 10@xmath030% which smoothly depend on frequency .",
    "close to the cyclotron frequency @xmath450% is reached .",
    "we note that this is not sufficient to fully explain the reduced x - ray flux which would require a reflectivity of @xmath485% .",
    "another possibility to suppress atomic line features is to employ super - strong magnetic fields .",
    "the energy levels for iron atoms in strong magnetic fields ( 10@xmath12 g ) calculated by neuhauser et al.@xcite are pretty much smeared over the entire letg energy range and have a spacing of 50@xmath0100ev .",
    "that could be easily resolved by the letg ( resolution @xmath171ev ) .",
    "however , the individual levels show a b@xmath18-dependence and therefore a smearing is expected to take place if the flux is integrated over the whole stellar surface . for a dipolar field with a factor of two variation of the magnetic field between pole and equator the lines would be broadened by 80@xmath0300ev .",
    "thus it is plausible , that the combination of a dense level structure of the magnetic atoms with a dispersion of the magnetic field produces a spectrum which appears as a continuum seen with the letg .",
    "we believe that this is the most promising model for explaining the featureless x - ray spectrum , but it has to be confirmed by detailed calculations .",
    "the upper limit of 1.3% for the amplitude of periodic variations requires a pretty good alignment between the rotational axis and the line of sight if the overall spectrum is represented by a two - temperature blackbody model @xcite .",
    "we note that this constraint can be somewhat ( but not fully ) relaxed if the x - ray flux were reduced due to reflection effects because the size of the x - ray emitting spot would be increased .",
    "another possibility is that the rotational frequency of the neutron star is larger than the present limit of observations ( 50hz ) .",
    "this will be checked by a forthcoming accepted xmm - newton observation with the epic pn - ccd camera in using its high time resolution mode .",
    "\\(1 ) rxj0720.4 - 3125 : the second brightest of the sources listed in table 1 is rxj0720 which looks like a twin of rxj1856 in many respects : it was discovered in the rosat all sky survey and has a ( blackbody ) temperature of kt=79@xmath54ev .",
    "the x - ray source was optically identified with a b=26.5mag object by motch & haberl @xcite and kulkarni & van kerkwijk @xcite .",
    "the optical to x - ray flux ratio is about 5 .",
    "rxj0720 shows x - ray pulsations with a period of 8.3914sec and a pulsed fraction of @xmath410% @xcite . a timing analysis including all available archival and new rosat , chandra , and xmm - newton data indicates that the source is spinning down with a rate of dp / dt@xmath410@xmath19ss@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "when interpreted in terms of magnetic braking this results in a magnetic field of b@xmath42@xmath210@xmath12 g .",
    "a broad spectral feature at @xmath4270ev was found in the epic - pn - spectra and when interpreted as a proton or iron cyclotron resonance yields a magnetic field strength of @xmath45@xmath210@xmath12 g and @xmath172.5@xmath210@xmath12 g , respectively , consistent with the value derived from the spin down @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) 1rxsj130848 + 2127 ( = rbs1223 ) : a strong broad band absorption feature was detected in the spectrum of this 10.31s pulsar , with a similarly inferred magnetic field strength of ( 2@xmath06)@xmath210@xmath12 g @xcite .",
    "this pulsar shows a double peaked pulse profile .",
    "the similarities of these three sources strengthen the case of a strong magnetic field of rxj1856 .",
    "actually the main difference between them may be in the configuration of spin axis , magnetic axis and the line of sight .",
    "yet another similarity between these sources regards the shape of the x - ray continuum .",
    "although in the cases of rxj1856 and rxj0720 a planckian distribution yields a very good fit to the data a modified planckian of the type e@xmath21@xmath2planckian fits even somewhat better . this has been first discussed by burwitz et al .",
    "@xcite for rxj1856 for which @xmath22 , but also applies to rxj0720 which has @xmath23 . in compensation for the steeper continuum the interstellar column densities",
    "n@xmath24 and temperatures of rxj1856 are reduced by @xmath450 and @xmath410% , respectively .",
    "we note that such a broad band modification does not affect the discussion of the absence of ( narrow band ) line features .",
    "but it may be connected with an energy dependent reflection coefficient of the emitting surface .",
    "in the absence of any spectral features the determination of the neutron star radius hinges on the distance , for which we adopt d=117pc @xcite . in the following we first use the parameters of a two component blackbody model for the optical and x - ray spectrum of rxj1856 ( burwitz et al .",
    "@xcite ) which is shown in fig .",
    "1a . the blackbody radius and temperature of the x - ray emitting hot spot derived from the chandra letg spectrum are r@xmath25=4.4 km and kt@xmath26ev , respectively .",
    "the optical spectrum is interpreted as the sum of the rayleigh - jeans spectra of both the hot and the cool component . this fixes ( r@xmath27)@xmath28@xmath2t@xmath29+(r@xmath25)@xmath28@xmath2t@xmath30=33ev@xmath2(17km)@xmath31 .",
    "the condition that the optical spectrum of the cool component does not show up as a deviation in the x - ray spectrum limits the corresponding temperature to kt@xmath32@xmath1733ev at the 3@xmath6 level @xcite . using these figures we find for the radius of the neutron star r=(r@xmath33+r@xmath34)@xmath35@xmath3616.5 km ( 3@xmath6 ) .    as an alternative",
    "we discuss a model with a continuous temperature distribution ( c.f .",
    "fig.[fig:1]b of the form @xmath37}^{-1}\\ ] ] the best fit to both the optical and the x - ray spectrum yields a central temperature of the hot spot t@xmath38=82ev , an angular size of the hot spot @xmath39=40@xmath40 and @xmath41=2.1 . in this case",
    "the neutron star radius is 16.8 km .",
    "we note that such hot spots may be caused by an anisotropic heat transport in strong magnetic fields ( @xmath3610@xmath12 g @xcite ) or by polar cap heating in a millisecond pulsar @xcite .    the quoted apparent radii r=16.5 km for the two - component model ( fig.[fig:1]a ) and r=16.8 km for the continuous temperature distribution model ( fig.[fig:1]b ) represent rather lower limits since they have been derived under the assumption of blackbody emission .",
    "these apparent radii r are related to the true stellar radius r@xmath42 which is usually quoted in the literature by @xmath43 where r@xmath44=2gm / c@xmath31 is the schwarzschild radius . for a standard neutron star of 1.4 solar masses",
    "the true radii are r@xmath42=14.0 km ( fig.[fig:1]a ) and r@xmath42=14.1 km ( fig.[fig:1]b ) , respectively , and thus considerably larger than the usual standard radius of 10 km .",
    "this implies a rather stiff equation of state .",
    "we note that the same conclusion was reached by braje & romani@xcite using a two component model and similar arguments . in order to compare our results in more detail with the predictions of theoretical neutron star models we use the mass - radius diagram given by pons et al.@xcite .",
    "this diagram is shown in fig.[fig:2 ] to which we have added a curve corresponding to the apparent radius derived in this paper .",
    "it is evident that the lower limit represented by the thick dashed curve excludes the quark star discussed in @xcite with high significance .",
    "it even excludes the quark star models discussed by schertler et al.@xcite which have even smaller radii , as well as neutron stars with strange quark matter cores discussed in the same paper . in view of the small uncertainties in the distance ( 117@xmath512)pc of rxj1856 and the fact that the blackbody leads to an underestimate of the emitting area we conclude that this object is a neutron star with a stiff equation of state and that the possibility for a quark star and a quark core star can be ruled out with high confidence .",
