    "* ) . to understand the processes that shape the planetary systems that we observe today , it is crucial to observe the planets during the period of formation and evolution .",
    "evidence has been found for extra - solar rings around a 16 myr - old pre - main sequence star in the upper centaurus - lupus subgroup of sco - cen , possibly indicative of early planet formation around a t tauri star @xcite .",
    "however , discovering and observing planets in the earliest stages of formation and evolution requires observing stars that are only @xmath3 myr old , as this is the timescale over which the planet forming disks are depleted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although recent work may indicate that the disks may last as long as @xmath4 myr @xcite . but stars at this age are notoriously active and spotted , making them photometrically and spectroscopically variable and making planet discovery at these young ages difficult ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) orion survey , conducted in the winters of 2009 and 2010 @xcite , was an attempt to address this deficit by searching for young transiting hot jupiters in the 25 ori group , a small association of t - tauri stars identified by @xcite . in @xcite , we reported the discovery of a promising young planetary candidate orbiting the known weak - lined t - tauri star ptfo  8 - 8695 with an age previously estimated of @xmath5  myr @xcite . superimposed on top of notable quasi - periodic variability , the star showed regular transit events with a period of just @xmath6 days .",
    "but unlike tw  hya , which is a classical t tauri star with active accretion @xcite and has periodic @xmath7% dips likely caused by the disk occulting a hot spot @xcite , ptfo  8 - 8695 , being a wtts , has no infrared excess and likely no disk to occult or veil the star .",

    "the fits implied a very high obliquity for the orbit ( @xmath15 ) , resulting in a prediction that the transits should change depth , shape , and _ disappear _ for periods of a few months to a year as the precession brings the planet s orbit out of the line of sight to the star .",

    "in particular , observations were needed to test that the transits changed shape , disappeared , and reappeared in a predictable manner .    towards this end ,",
    "we obtained follow - up observations of ptfo  8 - 8695 which included spitzer photometry to confirm the transit events in the infrared ; keck nirspec infrared radial velocity measurements to measure the radial velocity signature of the planet and the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite as the planet transited the star , hinted at in the original optical radial velocity data @xcite ; optical photometric monitoring with the las cumbres observatory global telescope network ( lcogt ) to support the radial velocity measurements and to better establish the transit parameters and orbit .",
    "the spitzer data , the keck nirspec data , and early optical lcogt photometry data were acquired before the realization that the transits could disappear completely , but these data , in the end , provided evidence for the changing and disappearing transits .",

    "additionally , the precession modeling does take into account the wavelength dependence of the transits - in particular , the effects of weakened limb and gravity darkening at the wavelengths of the spitzer observations @xcite .",
    "the data presented here are compared to the two models from @xcite .",
    "the higher stellar mass ( @xmath89 ) precession model predicts a precession period of 581 days with a 184 day stretch with no transits visible at all as a result of the orbit precessing out of the line of sight . within the time that transits are visible",
    ", there is a double peak of deep transits separated by about 200 days .",
    "the lower mass ( @xmath90 ) precession model predicts a similar transit structure as the higher mass model but on a more condensed time scale ( figure  [ precession0.34-fig ] ) .",
    "the precession period is approximately 293 days and the time between the deep transits is about 80 days and the transits only disappear completely for approximately 75 days .",
    "overall , the observations do not agree well with the @xmath89 model .",
    "the spitzer observations , observed to be only @xmath72% in depth are predicted by the model to be @xmath82% .",
    "further , the observations in 2012 december are predicted to have occurred when the transit depth was at its deepest @xmath91% .",
    "such a deep @xmath92% deep transit would have been detected in the lcogt data which have a transit detection limit of @xmath93% ( fig .",
    "[ lconontransit - fig ] ) . additionally , with a line - of - sight inclination of @xmath94 , the amplitude of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect should have been @xmath95 km / s and would likely have been detected by the nirspec radial velocity data at @xmath96 .",
    "finally , the 2013 november optical transit detection is predicted at approximately the right depth , but the shape of the observed transit is much narrower in comparison to the predicted transit , indicating that the model incorrectly represents the system orientation at the time of the observations .",
    "thus , the @xmath89 precession model is inconsistent with the observations for each of the three epochs of data presented .",
    "the @xmath90 precession model somewhat more closely matches the observations ( fig .",
    "[ lcotransit - fig ] ) .",
    "the spitzer light curve is represented well by the precession model transit prediction .",
    "both the depth and the shape of the observed transit are in good agreement with the model prediction .",
    "further , at the epoch of observations for the keck nirspec data and the first lcogt light curve ( 2012 december ) , the model predicts that the system should be non - transiting , and , indeed , the observations support the disappearance of the transiting events .",
    "the model predicts the return of the transits in late 2013 , and the 2013 november data confirm that the transits do reappear .",
    "however , the observations showed that the transits reappeared about 1 month earlier than predicted . with a precession orbital period of 293 days ,",
    "the model is out - of - sync with the observations by @xmath97% of the predicted precession period .",
    "the cause of the inconsistency of the @xmath90 model with the 2013 november observations , while predicting the 2012 april and 2012 december observations correctly , is difficult to discern , but could be the result of a variety of factors .",
    "the precession model depends heavily on knowledge of the stellar mass , the stellar moment of inertia , the stellar radius , and the planetary orbit eccentricity .",
    "the precession model assumes a circular orbit with a stellar radius of @xmath98 ; however , an eccentric orbit would allow for a larger stellar radius , which would affect the details of the precession model and the precession period .",
    "the precession period is , to first order , proportional to the square of the stellar radius ( @xmath99 ) , and is also dependent on higher order powers of the stellar radius ( e.g. , @xmath100 ) @xcite ; a @xmath101% change in the stellar radius could result in a @xmath102% change in the precession period .",
    "the precession model also uses as inputs the orbital period and epochs of transits ; even small errors on these , when propagated across three years and thousands of orbits , may explain why the @xmath90 model predicts correctly the 2012 data but not the 2013 data .",
    "finally , the precession modeling fits not only the timing of the transits but also the shape of the transits .",
    "if spots have significantly altered the shape of the transit , the precession model may not correctly predict the system parameters  particularly when the model is propagated through thousands of orbits .",
    "we can not place better constraints on the stellar or planetary candidate parameters with the data presented here .",
    "the parameter space of the precession models is extremely large and is difficult to narrow and beyond the intended scope of this paper .",
    "a recent paper , studying the same system with our ptf data but without requiring the spin - orbit to be synchronously locked , find that a precession model can still reproduce the observations , with a precession period of 199 days and a planet mass of @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "we are continuing to observe the planetary candidate with long - term photometric observations and radial velocity monitoring in an effort to assess more fully the existence and planetary nature of ptfo  8 - 8695b and to more carefully determine the validity and parameters of the precession model .",
    "while the observations presented here can not uniquely identify which precession model might best describe the data , we can utilize the nirspec radial velocity upper limits on the semi - amplitude to set limits on the potential mass of the planetary candidate .",
    "if the stellar mass is @xmath89 , then the mass limit on a possible planetary candidate is @xmath104 ; if the stellar mass is closer to @xmath90 , then the mass limit is @xmath105 . as indicated by the data , the planet candidate does not transit during the time of the radial velocity observations , which sets an upper limit on the line - of - sight orbital inclination of @xmath106 . at that inclination",
    ", the planet candidate mass would have a mass of @xmath107 .",
    "if the orbital inclination is as low as @xmath108 as predicted by the @xmath90 precession model , then the planetary candidate could have a mass of @xmath109 .",
    "ptfo  8 - 8685 is a low mass young star and as a result is variable and is likely spotted as discussed in @xcite(see also * ? ? ?",
    "the optical radial velocity curve modulations were attributed to the presence of spots , although not necessarily to the presence of a single spot .",
    "large and long - lived , high latitude spots are commonly present in weak - lined t tauri stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and spots have been seen to mimic eclipsing companions in other systems ( e.g. , rxj1608.6 - 3922 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in that work , light curve data obtained in multiple filters and spectroscopic monitoring enabled the authors to determine that the deep eclipses ( 0.5 mag ) , with long eclipse durations ( @xmath110 in phase ) , were caused by stellar spots which disappeared in observations obtained 4 years later .",
    "they also found that the photometric variations were also consistent with the 2.4 km / s radial velocity variations but not compatible with an eclipsing binary .",
    "@xcite could not find a spot distribution solution to fit the observed light curves for ptfo  8 - 8695 , but we revisit the possibility of spots as a cause of the observed transit events here . unlike rxj1608 , the observed transit features for ptfo  8 - 8695 are more shallow ( @xmath111 ) and shorter in duration ( 0.1 in phase ) , and , as seen in 2009 , sometimes flat - bottom during the event . in principle",
    ", a spotted surface with a single hot spot near the pole briefly eclipsed by the limb of the star may be able produce the short transit duration observed .",
    "however , such a hot spot would be expected to show a brightening @xmath112 out of phase with the flux dip but such a brightening is not seen in the data .",
    "in fact , many of the light curves from the 2009/2010 discovery data @xcite display a brightness decrease near these phases in the light curves .",
    "a cold spot below the equator could briefly come into view .",
    "in general , the spot size ( i.e. , the surface filling - factor ) needed to produce the observed transit depth can be estimated if we assume a photospheric temperature to spot temperature ratio ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the star has an effective temperature of @xmath114k @xcite and m - dwarf spots can be @xmath115k cooler than the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the optical ( 0.65 ) detections of the transit event have depths that range from @xmath116 corresponding to spot filling factors of @xmath117 . after taking into account the reduced contrast with the photosphere at longer wavelengths , the 0.58% infrared ( 4.5 ) transit depth corresponds to a filling - factor coverage of @xmath118 - a factor of @xmath119 times smaller . to explain the short transition duration of 0.1 in phase ( @xmath120 in longitude ) ,",
    "such a spot would need to have a viewable longitudinal extent of @xmath121 , and to yield a spot that covers @xmath122 of the surface , the viewable latitudinal extent of the spot would need to be @xmath123 , but a spot of such latitudinal extent would likely be visible for more than just 1/10 of the rotation period .",
    "all of this is not impossible for an active low - mass star , but the transit events would need to change shape and depth ( and be flat - bottomed as is the case for the 2009 data ) . at the same time , the spots would need to disappear and reappear at nearly the same stellar longitude over the course of @xmath1 years . as indicated in section  [ ephm - sub ] , the transit times agree with the predicted ephemerides to within @xmath124 minutes or about @xmath125% of the period .",
    "the spot would need to appear , evolve , disappear , and re - appear all within @xmath126 of the same stellar longitudinal position as the event timing ephemerides have been consistent for over three years , and do this all within the context of a generally spotted star producing the continuous variability of the star .    as in @xcite",
    ", we find it difficult to model the transit events in a self - consistent manner with the data acquired over 3 years .",
    "we are , however , continuing to pursue multi - year and multi - color light curves in an effort to understand better the nature of the stellar variability .    in section  [ ephm - sub ] , we refer to the brightening event in the 2012 december optical light curve that occurs at phase 0.8 .",
    "this brightening does not look like a typical flare with a sharp rise and exponential decline @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that this brightening is the result of an accretion event on the star .",
    "ptfo  8 - 8695 exhibits relatively strong h-@xmath127 emission and it has been noted that the planetary candidate is near or at the roche - limit  particularly , if the putative orbit is eccentric @xcite . as a result , the planetary candidate may be evaporating and the `` flare '' may actually be the result of infall onto the stellar surface",
    ". more detailed work on the h-@xmath127 emission and its variability is the subject of another paper @xcite .",
    "ptfo  8 - 8695b was discovered in the ptf - orion survey for transiting exoplanets by @xcite ; ptfo  8 - 8695b was found to be in an 0.45 day orbit and to have a mass of @xmath128 . that discovery was followed - up by a prediction by @xcite that the stellar rotation axis and the orbital plane of the planet should precess and that the transits should change shape and depth and disappear and reappear with a period of @xmath0 days .",
    "the two papers put together a coherent picture of a jupiter - sized planetary candidate orbiting a @xmath83myr old weak - lined t tauri star ; however , the precession model needed confirmation and ptfo  8 - 8695b remained a planetary candidate with a mass less than @xmath129 .",
    "we have obtained follow - up observations of ptfo  8 - 8695 that includes spitzer 4.5  light curve observations , keck nirspec radial velocity observations , and lcogt optical light curve observations .",
    "the data confirm that the transit events are persistent over many years and the times of the transits are predictable from the transit timing measurements , consistent with a steady period of 0.448 days .",
    "the transit events do appear to grow more shallow , disappear , and reappear as predicted by the precession modeling .",
    "however , the precession model and observations are not in perfect agreement and more observations are needed to place better constraints on the model and to confirm the planetary nature of the candidate ptfo  8 - 9695b . towards this end",
    ", we are pursuing additional long - term transit observations with lcogt and radial velocity monitoring that will help limit the models , the orbit , the stellar parameters , and help confirm or refute the planetary nature as the source of the observed transit events which have remained for over three years of observations .",
