    "according to the dirac s arguments , the large dimensionless numbers provided by atomic physics and astronomy of our universe are connected with each other @xcite .",
    "these numbers include : ( i ) the ratio of the electric to the gravitational force between an electron and a proton @xmath8 ; ( ii ) the age of the universe expressed in terms of the atomic unit @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the hubble constant ; ( iii ) the mass of the part of the universe which is receding from with a velocity @xmath11 , expressed in the units of the proton mass , say , @xmath12 .",
    "dirac introduced a large number hypothesis @xmath13 based on this hypothesis , dirac suggested a model of cosmology with a varying gravitational constant @xmath14 and an increase in the amount of matter in the universe .    based on the large number hypothesis , a number of cosmological models with a varying gravitational constant have been proposed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however most of them met many difficulties . noting that gravitational constant @xmath14 can not vary in general relativity ( gr ) , the first difficulty is that one must explain the contradiction between einstein gr and dirac cosmology .",
    "though much effort , for example , milne two time scale hypothesis @xcite , weyl s geometry @xcite etc .",
    ", has been devoted to reconcile the requirements of these two theories , it is still an open question to establish a theory which can unify the dirac cosmology and einstein gr .",
    "the second difficulty comes from experiments .",
    "almost all experiments at the scales of solar system and galaxies have not found the variation of @xmath14 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a possible variation of @xmath14 has been investigated with no success through geophysical and astronomical observations . from experimental results",
    "one tends to believe that @xmath14 is a constant for local system with large scale .",
    "the third difficulty belongs to the conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "usually we use a perfect - fluid energy - momentum tensor to describe the matter of universe and it is conserved in the cosmic evolution .",
    "the addition creation , the new matter created uniformly in the whole space , and the multiplication creation , the new matter created in regions where old matters exist , must come from other mechanism as suggested by dirac .",
    "many years ago a possible unified theory of dirac cosmology and gr to overcome the above difficulties was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "though one would expect a constant value of @xmath14 at the local system such as solar system , binary system and galaxies , it must be stressed that the cosmological observations still can not put strong limits on the time variation of @xmath14 in the cosmological scale , especially at the late time of the universe evolution @xcite@xcite . though einstein gr has been proved to be correct by many experiments such as the excess perihelion precession of mercury , gravitational redshift etc . at the scales of local system",
    ", it probably needs to be modified in the cosmological scale , especially if we want to use it to explain the recent observational result of the acceleration .",
    "using the idea of dirac cosmology with the variation of @xmath14 one could provide a possible way to modify the einstein gr .    as is well known , the lagrangian density of einstein gr with a cosmological term is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath17 can be generally explained as the background fluctuation of the cosmological vacuum , and @xmath18 is the 4-dimensional scalar curvature . in ordinary astrophysical problems of local systems ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath18 is about @xmath19 .",
    "since the vacuum energy density is much smaller compared to the density @xmath20 in local system , @xmath21 is a very small quantity and can be neglected .",
    "but in cosmological problems , because @xmath20 is small and has the same order as that of the vacuum energy density , @xmath21 can not be neglected . in the limit of vacuum or the matter domination area , @xmath22 , @xmath23",
    ", @xmath21 can attain the magnitude @xmath24 .",
    "this means that @xmath21 plays an important role at cosmological scale .",
    "however , there is only a first order term of @xmath21 in the equations of einstein cosmology . instead of the factor @xmath25",
    ", we argue that in a perfect cosmological theory , the lagrangian density of the gravitational field could contain higher - order terms of @xmath21 .",
    "we take the lagrangian density as @xmath26 where @xmath27 the einstein action becomes @xmath28    starting from eq.([e5 ] ) , we can establish a dirac cosmology with varying @xmath14 and matter creation .",
    "obviously , this theory can unify gr and dirac cosmology because in a local system with large scale , @xmath29 and the theory reduces to einstein gr . only at cosmological scale , the terms @xmath21 , @xmath30 ... become important and our theory reduces to dirac cosmology .",
    "recently , many authors have considered the terms @xmath31 and/or @xmath32 on gravity @xcite-@xcite . but none of them has connected with dirac cosmology and the large number hypothesis . in this paper , after introducing the higher order terms of @xmath21 , we will establish a unified theory of gr and dirac cosmology and explain the acceleration of the contemporary universe , variation of @xmath14 , cosmological supernova type ia data , and the creation of matter .",
    "we find that the addition creation of matter looks like the dark energy and the multiplication creation of matter like the dark matter .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : we will present our model in sec.ii . in sec.iii , by using the present cosmological parameters as our initial conditions , we will calculate numerically the physical quantities of our universe and study the addition creation and multiplication creation . we will prove that our results are in good agreement with present knowledge in cosmology .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusion will be given in sec.iv .",
    "up to the second order of magnitude @xmath33 , the action of our model is @xmath34 where @xmath0 is a expansion parameter and we will adjust it from supernova data later .",
    "the field equation for the metric is then @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter and @xmath37 is the covariant derivative induced by the metric .",
    "when @xmath38 , the constant curvature vacuum solutions require @xmath39 we find the constant - curvature vacuum solutions are not minkovski space , but rather de sitter space ( @xmath40 ) or anti - de sitter space ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "eq.([e7 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the einstein tensor , and @xmath44 @xmath45 the physical meaning of @xmath1 and @xmath46 is obvious .",
    "we see from eq.([e9 ] ) that @xmath1 plays the role of gravitational constant and @xmath46 the creation of energy - momentum in the universe .",
    "they depend on the second order term @xmath47 of the expansion @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath46 reduces to the ordinary vacuum energy cosmological term . since @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath46 depend on @xmath18 and then are functions of time @xmath51 , this is just the character predicted by dirac large number hypothesis .",
    "futhermore , using eq.([e9 ] ) and the bianchi identity , we get @xmath52 @xmath46 is no longer conserved . to understand the physical meaning of eq.([e12 ] ) , we rewrite it as following : @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath56 is created around the normal matter , while the creation of @xmath57 spreads over the whole universe . in the words of dirac cosmology",
    ", @xmath56 is the multiplication creation having the basic character of dark matter and @xmath58 is the addition creation having the basic character of dark energy .",
    "both of them depend on the variation of @xmath1 . in sec.iii ,",
    "the suggestions that addition and multiplication creations being dark energy and dark matter respectively will be elaborated numerically .    employing flat robertson - walker metric @xmath59 and the perfect - fluid energy momentum tensor @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the 4-velocity in fluid - rest frame , @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the energy density and pressure respectively . taking @xmath64 as the equation of state , @xmath65 for matter , @xmath66 for radiation , we find that the field equations become @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xmath72 are the energy density and pressure of the created matter , respectively .",
    "comparing to the kinetic term @xmath73 , @xmath74 which corresponds to a potential . here",
    "we only consider the case of positive curvature scalar @xmath18 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath18 is always positive in the evolution of the universe with matter and radiation . the kinetic term and the potential determine the evolution of @xmath1 explicitly .",
    "@xmath75 will reach its maximum at @xmath76 $ ] as shown in fig.([f1 ] ) .",
    "we also define @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath72 as the energy density and pressure of both of the multiplication and addition creation matter .",
    "the components of @xmath81 of eq.([e12.1 ] ) and eq.([e12.2 ] ) can be written as @xmath82 @xmath83 the other components of eq.([e12.1 ] ) and eq.([e12.2])@xmath84 give the identities about pressures @xmath85 and @xmath86 and no further information . since the multiplication creation @xmath87 looks like dark matter , we set @xmath88    eq.([e15])-eq.([e12.5 ] ) and the equation of scalar curvature @xmath89 = 6(\\dot h + 2h^2 ) \\ ] ] given by the flat robertson - walker metric form a complete set . in principle",
    ", we can solve the set of equations to find the behavior of the cosmological evolution .",
    "we now study the behavior of our universe containing matter and radiation . to find the cosmological solution , we need the initial conditions of eq.([e15])-eq.([e12.5 ] ) in the early universe which",
    ", unfortunately , is little known now .",
    "hence , we have done our numerical computation by using the present cosmological parameters as our initial conditions , which include the hubble parameters constant @xmath90 , the present deceleration @xmath91 , the cosmological constant @xmath92 ( as the scale ) , the density of baryon @xmath93 , the ratio of the baryon - to - matter ( including baryon and multiplication creation ) @xmath94 and the ratio of baryon - to - photon @xmath95@xcite .",
    "we will start from the present epoch and trace back the history of our universe .",
    "fig.[f4 ] shows the variation of @xmath1 in the evolution . the present time is set as @xmath96 .",
    "the three curves correspond to @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively .",
    "we see that the gravitational constant @xmath1 increases at first when the universe expands and then decreases at the late time .",
    "the ratio of the density of radiation to baryon floats up quickly and the scale factor @xmath99 as @xmath51 approaches the age of the universe , which are shown in fig.[f5 ] and fig.[f6 ] respectively .",
    "therefore , the radiation dominates the early universe .",
    "and the age of the universe given by @xmath100 is @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively . since there is no mechanism of inflation in our model , it is easy to understand that our model can consider the universe back to the epoch of radiation domination .",
    "fig.[f7 ] shows the evolution of the deceleration factor @xmath104 .",
    "we see that the universe decelerates in the early era and gradually stops decelerating and starts accelerating .",
    "this is in a good agreement with what we understand the universe nowadays . through the deceleration factor @xmath104",
    ", we notice that the scalar curvature @xmath18 is always positive .    obviously , @xmath0 is the parameter in our model which needs to be adjusted . to determine this parameter ,",
    "let us compare our model with the supernova data .",
    "noting that the uncertainty of the present value of the deceleration factor @xmath105 is still large , we will give a better estimation of the parameter @xmath0 and @xmath105 to fit the supernova data .",
    "fig.[f8 ] presents the supernova data as a phase portrait of the universe @xcite@xcite , where the universe was decelerating at high redshift and started accelerating when it was about two - third of the present size .",
    "our model is favored by this set of data : @xmath106 and @xmath107 . comparing fig.[f8 ] and",
    "the curves given by fig.2 of ref@xcite , we find that the fit of our curve is better than that of the standard model .",
    "fig.[f9 ] shows the evolution of the pressure of the density of the addition creation matter with @xmath108 .",
    "the pressure is highly positive in the beginning of the universe , falls quickly blow zero and has a negative value in the recent and present era .",
    "this negative pressure looks like the character of the dark energy .",
    "if we take @xmath109 as the equation of state of addition creation , we show the parameter of the pressure - to - density of the addition creation @xmath110 versus time @xmath51 in fig.[f10 ] and find @xmath111 which is much smaller than @xmath112 and is consistent with the requirement of dark energy to explain the accelerating universe . to compare our results with other models , we have also calculated the ratio of the density of addition creation and find @xmath113 and that of the density of matter ( multiplication creation and normal matter ) in our model reads @xmath114 these results have the same magnitude as that dark energy and dark matter respectively .",
    "hence , we suggest that the dark energy comes from the addition creation and the dark matter from the multiplication creation .",
    "we have suggested a model to unify the einstein gr and dirac cosmology . in local system , our theory reduces to gr , but in the cosmological scale , our theory refers to the dirac cosmology .",
    "the variation of the gravitational constant comes from the scalar curvature . in the local system ,",
    "the variation of the gravitational constant is negligible .",
    "this result is in good agreement with present experiments .",
    "but in the cosmological scale , the change of @xmath1 is remarkable .",
    "the acceleration of the present universe is a proof of the decrease of the gravitational constant @xmath1 , because the decrease of @xmath1 corresponds to an effective repulsion .    after introducing the term @xmath115 in our theory and",
    "fit the adjust parameter @xmath0 by supernova data , we have calculated the physical quantities of @xmath116 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 by using the data of present epoch as the initial conditions .",
    "we have found that the results are self - consistent and in good agreement with present knowledge of cosmology .    according to dirac large number hypothesis ,",
    "matter will be created in the universe .",
    "we have calculated the matter comes from addition creation and that from multiplication .",
    "an interesting picture in our theory is that the addition creation , which spreads over the universe , looks like the dark energy and the multiplication creation , which clusters around the normal matter , like the dark matter .",
    "we have found that the pressure of addition creation has a big positive value initially and fall down quickly to become a negative value .",
    "it has a negative pressure region corresponding @xmath117 .",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath118 at present .",
    "this value is in agreement with present dark energy models .",
    "we have also calculated the ratio of the density of the addition creation and found @xmath6 .",
    "the same parameter but for multiplication creation , radiation and normal matter has also been computed , which reads @xmath119 . both of them have the same magnitude of the observational value of the dark energy and matter .",
    "this result suggests that the dark energy and dark matter are just the addition creation and the multiplication creation in dirac cosmology .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that this model can not be extended to the big bang epoch .",
    "we have not add the terms with @xmath120 ( or @xmath121 ) in the lagrangian density . obviously , these terms are very important to the very early universe , especially in the inflationary epoch",
    ". our model can only be used in the time evolution regions starting from the radiation dominated epoch to the present time .",
