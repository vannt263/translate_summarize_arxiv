    "<S> the spin-1 heisenberg model on a triangular lattice with the ferromagnetic nearest- and antiferromagnetic third - nearest - neighbor exchange interactions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xmath3 , is studied with the use of the spinpack code . </S>",
    "<S> this model is applicable for the description of the magnetic properties of niga@xmath4s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground , low - lying excited state energies and spin - spin correlation functions have been found for lattices with n=16 and n=20 sites with the periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in qualitative agreement with earlier authors results obtained with mori s projection operator technique .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs : 75.10.jm , 67.40.db    ,    heisenberg antiferromagnet , triangular lattice , exact diagonalization    the spin-1 @xmath6-@xmath7 heisenberg model on a triangular lattice , which takes into account the ferromagnetic nearest- and antiferromagnetic third - nearest - neighbor exchange interactions ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) is of interest as a minimal model for the description of magnetic properties of the compound niga@xmath4s@xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are mainly determined by the two - dimensional triangular lattice of ni@xmath8 ions with the spin @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the magnetic neutron scattering experiment revealed the incommensurate short - range order @xcite - the scattering intensity had a maximum at some incommensurate vector @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the classical version of the @xmath6-@xmath7 model was proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , authors of which were able to reproduce the observed incommensurate order with the vector @xmath10 by fitting the ratio @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum @xmath6-@xmath7 heisenberg model was investigated in our recent papers @xcite with the use of mori s projection operator technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that at zero temperature , depending on the ratio @xmath6/@xmath7 , the system is characterized by the ferromagnetic ordering , spin disorder , incommensurate and commensurate antiferromagnetic ordering . at @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> the model describes key features observed [ 1 ] in niga2s4 - the incommensurate antiferromagnetic short - range order at finite temperature , the quadratic temperature dependence of specific heat and the shape of the uniform susceptibility .    applying mori s method </S>",
    "<S> one has to use a number of approximations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is of interest to study the same model with another method and compare obtained results . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we employ schulenburg s spinpack code @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this package is dedicated for exact diagonalization ( ed ) of finite spin system using lanczos algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the model reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the components of the spin-1 operators @xmath16 , * n * and * m * label sites of the triangular lattice , @xmath17 . as mentioned above , we take into account the nearest - neighbor and third - nearest - neighbor interactions , @xmath18 with the vectors * a * and * a=2a * connecting the respective sites . here </S>",
    "<S> the frustration parameter @xmath19 is introduced , @xmath0 , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 will be used below as the unit of energy . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath22 we found energies of the ground , low - lying excited states and spin - spin correlation functions for lattices containing @xmath23 and @xmath24 sites . </S>",
    "<S> these lattices are shown in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic boundary conditions were used . from our earlier study of the quantum @xmath6-@xmath7 heisenberg model on a @xmath25 lattice with mori s method </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is known that the system is ferromagnetically ordered in the interval @xmath26 , @xmath27 , when the ferromagnetic coupling @xmath28 is larger than @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found the same value also in the classical @xmath6-@xmath7 model on an infinite lattice .    as seen from figs . 2 and 3 , the ground state ( gs ) of the n - site lattice </S>",
    "<S> is transformed from the classic ferromagnet ( s = n ) to the singlet state at some critical value of the frustration parameter @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> for the lattices with n=16 and n=20 these critical values are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . it can be supposed that with the rise of the lattice size this critical value will tend to the value @xmath31 obtained in @xcite . according to @xcite a transition from the ferromagnetically </S>",
    "<S> ordered state to a spin disorder occurs at this value of the frustration parameter @xmath31 . in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2a and 3a the dependencies of the gs energy ( @xmath32 , s = n ) and the first excited state ( @xmath33 , s=15 and s=19 , correspondingly ) on @xmath19 are presented . </S>",
    "<S> these dependencies are linear . differences between the gs and excited - state energies disappear at the critical values @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for @xmath36 and @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> the energies of the low - lying states are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b and 3b . </S>",
    "<S> the gs is characterized by s=0 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest excited states are characterized by s=0 ( @xmath38 ) and s=1 ( @xmath39 ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice that relative positions of the curves for the first singlet @xmath38 and the first triplet @xmath39 excitations are different for n=16 and n=20 . </S>",
    "<S> apparently the difference is related to the small size of the lattices and difference in their shapes .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin gap - the energy difference between the first excited triplet and the singlet ground state - is shown in fig . 4 for n=16 and n=20 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 we compare the dependencies of the gs energy per site on the frustration parameter @xmath19 in the n=20 , n=16 lattices , obtained by ed , and in a @xmath25 lattice obtained by mori s projection operator technique @xcite . as a whole </S>",
    "<S> these dependencies are similar . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see , all these plots are linear in the ferromagnetic region ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) . besides , @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this sequence of the critical values of @xmath19 seems reasonable because mori s result was obtained in the largest lattices . for @xmath43 or @xmath41 all curves </S>",
    "<S> have maxima . </S>",
    "<S> however , positions of the maxima are different : @xmath44 in the results obtained with mori s technique , @xmath45 for n=16 and @xmath46 for n=20 . </S>",
    "<S> spin correlation functions for nearest- and third - nearest - neighbors are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 6 . </S>",
    "<S> the data were obtained by the exact diagonalization in the n=20 lattice and by mori s technique in a @xmath25 lattice . in panels ( a ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) ed correlations are constant and equal to unity in the ferromagnetic phase for @xmath47 in this region correlation functions obtained by mori s method are also constant . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are somewhat smaller than one due to approximations made in the s=1 case [ 2 ] . the interaction between nearest neighbor spins vanishes at @xmath48 , which manifests itself in the vanishing correlation @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation @xmath50 depends only weakly on @xmath19 in the range @xmath37 and @xmath51 . analyzing condensation parameters , in ref.[2 ] </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that at @xmath52 in the range @xmath53 there exists a spin - disordered phase . for larger frustration parameters the system becomes an antiferromagnet with an incommensurate ordering vector , which varies with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the phase transition at @xmath54 does not reveal itself in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 6 . </S>",
    "<S> as seen from the figure , curves obtained in the larger lattice are more smooth than those in the n=20 lattice , which , at least partly , may be connected with finite - size effects </S>",
    "<S> . however , spin correlations calculated in the two lattices by two different methods are in general close and behave similarly with changing the frustration parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude that results obtained with the approximate approach based on mori s projection operator technique are in reasonable agreement with the exact - diagonalization data .    in conclusion , we investigeted the spin-1 heisenberg model on a triangular lattice with the ferromagnetic nearest- and antiferromagnetic third - nearest - neighbor exchange interactions with the use of the exact diagonalization of small lattices with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the spinpack code using the lanczos method was employed to find the energies of the ground and low - lying exited states in the entire range of the frustration parameter @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the nearest- and third - nearest exchange constants . besides , spin - spin correlation functions between nearest- and third - nearest spins and spin gaps were calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we found qualitative and in some cases quantitative agreement between results on the ground - state energy and spin correlations , obtained by exact diagonalization of small lattices and by mori s projection technique in larger lattices . </S>"
