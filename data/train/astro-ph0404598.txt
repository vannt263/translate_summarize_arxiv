    "during the huge energy release of a cluster merging , different mechanisms are at work on galaxies .",
    "on one side , the rapid changes in the tidal gravitational field can drive gas from outer to inner parts of galaxies , triggering star bursts and feeding the central agn ( @xcite ) , while on the other side tidal stripping and ram pressure tend to devoid galaxies of their hydrogen .",
    "@xcite found that a2125 , a merging cluster , presents a factor 4 more radiogalaxies than a relaxed one ( a2645 ) at the same distance . in order to better study this phenomenon , we performed an extensive radio survey at 20 cm with the atca telescope on the cluster complexes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) located in the shapley concentration ( @xcite ) .    the only way to estimate",
    "the radio activity of the clusters is to compute the bivariate radio - optical luminosity function ( figure 1 ) , i.e. the number of radiogalaxies in the considered structure ( as confirmed by their redshift ) over the total number of optical galaxies .",
    "this takes into account the different richness of the clusters .",
    "we found that the a3558 complex , which is a merging in an advanced phase , presents a significant lack of radiosources ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . on the contrary",
    "the a3528 complex , which is at an early phase of interaction , presents a number of radiosources comparable to that of normal clusters .",
    "also the a3571 complex , a merging at the end of the process , does not have pecularities in the number of radio objects .",
    "this result is only apparently in contraddiction with @xcite , because one has to take into account the spiral richness of interacting clusters and/or the merging phase .",
    "our proposed scenario is the following : at very early stages of merging , the outer parts of clusters ( which are spiral rich ) begin to interact , triggering star formation activity and therefore enhancing the number of radiosources .",
    "after this episode , the radiosource excess disappears and the clusters return quiescent ( right panel of figure 1 ) , until the ellipticals ( with their agns ) in the inner part of the clusters are reached by the merging effect , leading to a lowering of the agn emission : as a result , there is a deficit of bright radiosources ( left panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "finally , the virialization re - establishes the starting situation .",
    "in order to better study the lack of radiosources in the a3558 complex , we performed a dedicated , deep ( @xmath0 mjy b@xmath1 ) survey in the region between the two clusters a3558 and a3562 ( see figure 2 , @xcite ) .",
    "this region is promising because it is highly substructured and presents features indicating an ongoing merging ( see the contribution of bardelli , this conference ) .",
    "moreover , we discovered an interesting radio halo in the a3562 cluster ( see the contribution of giacintucci , this conference ) .",
    "the groups of this region tend to have bluer galaxies , indicating a possible ongoing starburst , and their hot gas distributions are highly disturbed ( @xcite ) .    given the high statistics , we computed the radio luminosity function for both early and late type galaxies in this region , finding for elliptical and s0 galaxies consistency with @xcite .",
    "given the lack of bright radiosources that we found analysing the whole a3558 complex ( see previous section ) , this result suggests that the deficit is entirely due to the a3558 cluster .",
    "moreover , a population of faint ( @xmath2<22 $ ] ) radiogalaxies has been found : half of these objects are blue , suggesting that starburst is the driving radio emission mechanism .",
    "finally , we found 14 spiral galaxies , whose ratio between radio and optical emission is similar to that of galaxies located in rich and dynamically evolved clusters .",
    "the next steps of this analysis will be the following : + 1 ) extending the study to other systems in other superclusters : in particular we are analysing the cluster a2061 in the corona borealis supercluster ; + 2 ) extending the survey to other wavelengths : in particular we obtained @xmath3 mhz observations of the a3558 complex with the gmrt telescope ; + 3 ) studying the hi emission of spiral galaxies in order to see whether the ongoing merging in the a3558 complex was able to strip gas from galaxies in between the dominant clusters ."
