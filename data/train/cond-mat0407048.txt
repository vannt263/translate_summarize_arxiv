    "this lagrangian formalism has the following significant advantage : not only is this approach exact , but also it provides the basis for a powerful approximate variational method .",
    "if the condensate wave function depends on various parameters @xmath30 of the given system , the resulting lagrangian @xmath31 provides the dynamical equations of motion of these parameters @xmath30 .",

    "the positions of the vortices \\{@xmath32 } serve as the time - dependent variational parameters for two distinct cases : ( 1 ) a uniform condensate in a rigid cylinder and ( 2 ) a nonuniform trapped condensate in the tf limit  @xcite .    in our variational approach",

    "to proceed , it is first necessary to choose a specific form for the phase @xmath39 of the condensate wave function .",
    "the boundary conditions are quite different for a uniform condensate and for a tf condensate , and it is convenient to treat them separately .      the uniform condensate in a rigid circular cylinder of radius @xmath40 must satisfy the boundary condition that the normal component of the particle current vanishes at the surface of the cylinder . this condition can be ensured with an image vortex of opposite circulation at the external position @xmath41 for each vortex at @xmath32 in the cylinder .",

    "thus , we choose @xmath59 where @xmath60 and the velocity field is given by @xmath61 this two - dimensional stream function has the advantage being single - valued .",
    "when describing irrotational flow in the presence of vortices , @xmath58 satisfies poisson s equation @xmath62 the right - hand side vanishes everywhere except for the finite number of singular points at the location of the vortices ( the image vortices lie outside the physical region and do not appear here ) .",

    "frame , the vortices all rotate at the same rate as the external rotation @xmath73 . physically this result can be understood when we imagine that the vortex core contains some normal component , and the relative motion of the normal component with respect to the frame of the rotating trap gives rise to dissipation .",

    ", we can determine the state with lowest energy and the associated angular velocity @xmath108 , at which the transition from vortex state @xmath109 to vortex state @xmath110 should occur . here",
    "we will consider two types of vortex configurations for each ( uniform / tf ) condensate ; a ring of vortices _ without _ a vortex at the center ( ` @xmath111 ' configuration ) and a ring of vortices _ with _ a vortex at the center ( ` @xmath111 + 1 ' configuration ) .    for both the uniform and the tf condensates , the vortex - free state is energetically favored for any angular velocity below @xmath112 because it has the lowest free energy . as @xmath73 increases , however , the free energy of the one - vortex state decreases at a faster rate than that of the vortex - free state . at @xmath112 ,",

    "the two condensates display one interesting difference , however , arising from the different density profiles . in the tf approximation , the thermodynamic critical angular velocity @xmath112 ( the usual lower critical angular velocity @xmath116 ) for the appearance of the first central vortex is given very generally by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the energy per particle for one central vortex and @xmath119 is the angular momentum per particle for the same central vortex .",
    "evidently , @xmath112 is proportional to the average value of @xmath120 with the number density as the non - negative weight .",
    "the tf condensate @xmath121 has the maximum density at the center ; thus the corresponding @xmath112 is larger than that for the uniform condensate ( the difference leads to a factor @xmath122 in the present two - dimensional case ) .",
    "the state with five vortices in a ring plus one at the center ( 5 + 1 configuration ) always has a lower free energy than the state with all six vortices in a ring ( 6 configuration ) , so the ` 5 ' to ` 6 ' transition is not favored ; instead , ` 5 ' goes to ` 5 + 1 ' .",
    "in fact , this specific ` 5 ' to ` 5 + 1 ' transition was observed in an early experiment on rotating superfluid @xmath0he  @xcite . in a uniform unbounded condensate ,",
    "the vortices form a triangular ( abrikosov ) lattice with six - fold rotational symmetry . here",
    "the transition from a single ring with an empty center ( ` @xmath111 ' ) to a ring with a central vortex ( ` @xmath111 + 1 ' ) happens when the condensate has five vortices in a ring ( @xmath123 ) instead of six , which reflects the finite size of our geometry .",

    "[ fig : vtx_window](b ) ] .    1 .   for a single vortex",
    ", the dynamics is dominated either by the image vortex ( for the uniform condensate ) or by the nonuniform trap potential ( for the tf condensate ) . for two or more vortices , however ,",
    "the vortex - vortex interactions become increasingly dominant , and the two systems are expected to become more and more similar .",
    "2 .   in a transition from ` 5 ' to ` 5 + 1 ' for the tf condensate , the region of complex excitation modes ( indicated by the solid bar ) remains almost unchanged , although the number of vortices increases .",
    "another notable difference is that , for the ` 8 + 1 ' tf configuration , the region of complex eigenmodes ( dynamically unstable ) expands significantly , leaving a narrower region of external rotation frequency over which this configuration is metastable .",
    "the time - dependent variational analysis based on the lagrangian formalism provides a direct and flexible method to study the dynamics of vortices in a bose - einstein condensate . by analyzing the time - independent free energy @xmath124",
    ", we determine the various ground states and the associated angular velocities for the transitions from one state to the next .",
    "a more complete dynamical picture emerges when we consider the full lagrangian @xmath125 , for it provides the explicit time dependence : for example , the vortex precession frequency , the excitation spectrum and the dynamical stability .    for a given configuration of vortices ,",
    "the critical @xmath73 for the onset of stability is larger for the tf condensate than for the uniform condensate , by approximately a factor of two . as a result",
    ", a single ring of @xmath111 vortices ( without and with a central vortex ) has a smaller radius in the tf condensate than in the uniform condensate , typically , by @xmath126 .",
    "the lagrangian formalism has the notable feature that it apparently incorporates valuable physical information that would otherwise emerge only with significant additional effort .",
    "for example , the lagrangian analysis of the low - lying normal modes of a condensate  @xcite used a gaussian trial function , but the resulting dynamics reproduced the known frequencies even in the tf limit where the density profile has a parabolic form .",
    "similarly here , the lagrangian formalism yields the correct precession of a single vortex , even though the assumed stream function is equivalent to purely incompressible flow . to understand this question in more detail , note that the velocity field assumed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stream ] ) can equivalently be written as @xmath127 , which implies that @xmath128 . since we are merely constructing a trial function ,",
    "this choice is acceptable , even though the correct equation of continuity requires @xmath129 .",
    "nevertheless , the lagrangian approach incorporates sufficient physical information ( presumably through the energy @xmath124 ) that the resulting precession in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prec_tf ] ) agrees with other more lengthy analyses .    a direct approach to the precession relies on the full equation @xmath130 .",
    "the extra term involving @xmath131 ( namely the spatial variation in the condensate density ) produces additional logarithmic contributions to the phase  @xcite , which drive the precessional motion .",
    "thus the precession of a single vortex in a tf condensate can be considered to arise from the nonuniform trap potential and the resulting nonuniform tf density .",
    "it would be interesting to improve the trial function by including these additional logarithmic contributions explicitly .",
    "since the variational lagrangian approach is `` exact '' for the exact solution of the gp equation , such an improved wave function should provide an improved description , but it is not clear whether the dynamical precession rate would be affected .",
    "as studied in this work , the single - ring configuration is applicable only for a small number of vortices ( @xmath132 in practice ) in a tf condensate that rotates relatively slowly .",
    "the single ring does have one other very interesting application , however , when the condensate has a central hole and thus becomes annular .",
    "such behavior is predicted to occur in a rapidly rotating trap with an additional quartic confinement , which allows the angular velocity @xmath73 to exceed the harmonic trap frequency @xmath133 . when the width of the annulus becomes sufficiently narrow ,",
    "the condensate is predicted to have a one - dimensional array of vortices arranged in a single ring  @xcite .",
    "the techniques developed here should apply directly to the dynamics and stability of this interesting configuration .",

    "<S> the dynamics of a ring of vortices in two - dimensional bose - einstein condensates ( with and without an additional vortex at the center ) is studied for ( 1 ) a uniform condensate in a rigid cylinder and ( 2 ) a nonuniform trapped condensate in the thomas - fermi limit . </S>",
    "<S> the sequence of ground states ( within these single - ring configurations ) is determined as a function of the external rotation frequency by comparing the free energy of the various states . for each ground state , </S>",
    "<S> the tkachenko - like excitations and the associated dynamical stability are analyzed . </S>"
