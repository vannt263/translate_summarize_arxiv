    "the hadronization of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) possibly produced in the early universe or expected to be formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been the focus of much attention during the past few years .",
    "however , the mechanism of hadronization ( qcd phase transition ) remains an open question .",
    "the prediction of lattice qcd on the order of the transition is still unclear , if physical masses for quarks are used @xcite .",
    "quenched qcd ( no dynamical quarks ) shows a first - order phase transition , albeit a weak one , with small surface tension and latent heat @xcite . assuming the transition to be first - order , homogeneous nucleation theory @xcite has been invoked extensively to study the dynamics of the quark hadron phase transition both in the context of early universe as well as for the plasma produced during relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in this picture , the transition is initiated by the nucleation of critical - size hadron bubbles from a supercooled metastable qgp phase .",
    "these hadron bubbles can grow against surface tension , converting the qgp phase into the hadron phase as the temperature drops below the critical temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "this is indeed the case for a sufficiently strong first order transition , where the assumption of a homogeneous background of qgp is justified at the time when the nucleation begins .",
    "however , for a weak enough transition , the qgp phase may not remain in a pure homogeneous state even at @xmath1 , due to pre - transitional phenomena . for temperatures much above @xmath0 , matter is in a pure qgp phase with the effective potential exhibiting one minimum at @xmath2=0 . here",
    "@xmath2 is an effective scalar order parameter generally used to model the effective potential describing the dynamics of a phase transition .",
    "as the plasma expands and cools to some temperature @xmath3 , an inflection point is developed away from the origin which on further cooling separates into a maximum at @xmath2=@xmath4 and a local minimum at @xmath5 , corresponding to the hadron phase . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the potential is degenerate with a barrier separating the two phases .",
    "`` pre - transitional phenomena '' refers to nonperturbative dynamical effects above @xmath0 in the range @xmath6 .",
    "such phenomena are known to occur in several areas of condensed matter physics , as in the case of isotropic to nematic phase transition in liquid crystals@xcite , and are also expected in the cosmological electroweak phase transition leading to large phase mixing at @xmath1@xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the phase transition may proceed either through percolation @xcite or , if the phase mixing is below the percolation threshold , by the nucleation of critical bubbles in the background of isolated hadronic domains , which grow as @xmath7 drops below @xmath0 . in either case , the kinetics is quite different from what is expected on the basis of homogeneous nucleation @xcite .",
    "we will argue that , for a wide range of physical parameters , a large amount of thermal phase mixing at @xmath1 is expected to occur during the quark - hadron phase transition in the early universe , as well for the plasma produced in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . for high enough temperatures and low enough cooling , large - amplitude thermal fluctuations will populate the new minimum at @xmath5 in the range @xmath8 .",
    "although these fluctuations which are in the form of subcritical hadron bubbles will shrink and finally disappear , there will always be some non - zero number density of hadron bubbles at a given temperature @xmath7 . in this work ,",
    "we study the equilibrium density distribution of subcritical hadron bubbles for a wide spectrum of very weak to very strong first order qcd phase transition , using the formalism developed in refs .",
    "it is found that the density of subcritical hadron bubbles builds up faster as the transition becomes weaker , leading , in some cases , to complete phase mixing at @xmath1 .",
    "further , using reasonable values for the surface tension and correlation length as obtained from lattice qcd calculations , we find that ( although large ) the amount of phase mixing remains below the percolation threshold .",
    "therefore , the quark - hadron phase transition will begin with the nucleation of critical - size hadron bubbles from a supercooled and inhomogeneous background of quark - gluon plasma .",
    "since the background contains subcritical hadron bubbles , the homogeneous theory of nucleation needs to be modified . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an approximate method was suggested to incorporate this inhomogeneity by modelling subcritical bubbles as gaussian fluctuations , resulting in a large reduction in the nucleation barrier .",
    "here , we will study inhomogeneous nucleation in the framework of homogeneous theory , but with a reduced nucleation barrier that accounts for the inhomogeneity of the medium . finally , we also briefly discuss possible implications of inhomogeneous nucleation to relativistic heavy - ion collisions and cosmology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we begin with the discussion of a quartic double - well potential used to describe the dynamics of a first - order quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "the parameters of the potential are obtained in terms of relevant physical quantities such as critical temperature , surface tension and correlation length . in section iii",
    ", we estimate the equilibrium fraction of subcritical hadron bubbles from very weak to strong first - order phase transitions .",
    "we also estimate the reduction in the nucleation barrier by incorporating the presence of subcritical bubbles in the medium . using this reduced barrier",
    ", we study nucleation and supercooling in section iv",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in section v.",
    "we consider a general form of the potential ( or equivalently , the homogeneous part of the helmholtz free energy density ) to study the quark - hadron phase transition in terms of a real scalar order parameter @xmath2 given by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are positive constants .",

    "@xcite use this parameterization to describe the phase transition from a qgp ( symmetric phase ) to a hadron phase ( broken symmetry ) .",
    "the meaning of @xmath2 is obvious for a symmetry - breaking transition , but the same description can be used if no symmetry is involved .",
