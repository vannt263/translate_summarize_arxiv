    "higher order moments , or more accurately higher order cumulants , of conserved charges are central observables analyzed in the ongoing low energy runs at rhic .",
    "it also is quite straightforward to analyze their thermal properties in equilibrium thermodynamics of qcd , e.g. by performing lattice qcd calculations",
    ". ratios of cumulants of different order are particularly well suited for a comparison with experiment as they are independent of the interaction volume .",
    "lattice qcd calculations have shown that such ratios , e.g. ratios of baryon number , electric charge or strangeness fluctuations , are quite sensitive probes for detecting critical behavior in qcd .",
    "they are sensitive to universal scaling properties at vanishing as well as non - vanishing baryon chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) and directly reflect the internal degrees of freedom that are carriers of the corresponding conserved charge @xcite in a thermal medium .",
    "these ratios change rapidly in the crossover region corresponding to the chiral transition in qcd and reflect the change from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom @xcite . in the low temperature phase of qcd ratios of cumulants",
    "seem to be well described by a hadron resonance gas model ( hrg ) @xcite .",
    "the hrg is also very successful in describing the thermal conditions which characterize the chemical freeze - out of hadron species .",
    "the freeze - out temperature and its dependence on @xmath0 is found to be close to the pseudo - critical temperature @xmath1 for the qcd transition .",
    "we recently pointed out that also ratios of cumulants of net baryon number fluctuations , as measured by star at different beam energies @xcite , agree well with hrg model calculations on the chemical freeze - out curve @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluctuations ] . at the same time",
    "these results are also consistent with lattice qcd calculations when temperature and chemical potential in these calculations is chosen to agree with the freeze - out parameters @xcite .",
    "this also is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluctuations ] .",
    "the hrg model , of course , is not sensitive to critical behavior .",
    "the agreement of current lattice calculations with hrg model calculations of ratios of cumulants including up to fourth order fluctuations thus also indicates that they present so far no compelling evidence for critical behavior .",
    "we recently argued that a determination of sixth order cumulants may be particularly helpful in this respect as they clearly deviate from hrg model calculations in the crossover region of qcd and start to become sensitive to critical behavior earlier in the hadronic phase @xcite . in the following",
    "we will point out some generic features of higher order cumulants in qcd that arise from universal properties of qcd close to the chiral limit of vanishing light quark masses , @xmath2 .",
    "at vanishing baryon chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) , as well as in a certain range @xmath3 , qcd is expected to undergo a second order phase transition for @xmath4 . in this entire range of @xmath0 values",
    "the chiral phase transition belongs to the universality class of 3-dimensional , o(4 ) symmetric spin models . in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition temperature ( @xmath5 )",
    "thermodynamic quantities show universal properties that are controlled by the singular part , @xmath6 , of the free energy . for",
    "a fixed value of the chemical potential @xmath7 , close to @xmath5 the free energy may be parametrized as , @xmath8 with @xmath9 denoting the particular scaling combination of the reduced temperature @xmath10 and the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath11 , which for qcd is taken to be the ratio of light and strange quark masses , @xmath12 ; @xmath13 denote critical exponents of the 3-d , o(4 ) universality class .",
    "cumulants of net baryon number fluctuations are then obtained as derivatives of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "close to the chiral limit and for @xmath17 these derivatives are dominated by the singular part , @xmath18 the first derivative of the scaling function that leads in the chiral limit to a divergent cumulant at @xmath19 and , in fact , leads to a change of sign of @xmath20 at @xmath19 is obtained from the third derivative of the scaling function @xmath21 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] ( left ) we show this scaling function for the 3-d , o(4 ) universality class which recently has been extracted from high statistics spin model calculations @xcite .",
    "the right hand part of this figure shows how the singular contribution strengthens as the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath11 is reduced .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling](right ) that the universal scaling properties of cumulants will , for sufficiently small values of the quark mass , induce negative values for cumulants already for @xmath22 .",
    "however , as shown in eq .",
    "[ fluct_mass ] , the contribution from the singular part is weighted by a factor proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "its contribution to the total value of the cumulant may thus be small for small values of @xmath24 and non - zero values of the quark mass .",
    "nonetheless , negative values for @xmath25 and @xmath26 order moments have been found in model calculations @xcite    the first cumulant , which is not parametrically suppressed by powers of @xmath24 and thus stays finite even at @xmath27 is the sixth order cumulant of net baryon number fluctuations .",
    "this cumulant changes sign in the crossover region of the qcd transition .",
    "although the temperature at which the sixth order cumulant changes sign is not a universal quantity there are strong indications from lattice @xcite as well as model @xcite calculations that the change of sign occurs close to the chiral transition temperature .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c6 ] .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently small values of the quark mass , i.e. , in the o(4 ) scaling regime , the location of the minimum of the sixth order cumulant and its position relative to the pseudo - critical temperature for the chiral transition is controlled by the location of the maximum of @xmath21 and its location relative to the peak in the chiral susceptibility .",
    "the latter appears at a somewhat higher temperature @xcite .",
    "for @xmath28 the onset of negative values for @xmath29 indeed follows the crossover line for the qcd transition @xcite .",
    "sixth order cumulants are thus expected to change sign at a temperature below the ( pseudo - critical ) chiral transition temperature .",
    "this effect should become visible even at the lhc and the highest rhic energy if chemical freeze out indeed occurs close to the qcd transition temperature and if higher moments probe these freeze out conditions .",
