    "in the last six years , brown dwarfs , objects of mass too low to sustain equilibrium hydrogen burning , have gone from being a theoretical concept with no observed examples to being observationally ubiquitous ( basri 2000 ) .",
    "young brown dwarfs have been discovered in large numbers in star- forming regions ( e.g. hambly et al .",

    "objects with masses ranging from just substellar to those of the solar system s giant planets have been found directly or indirectly as companions to nearby stars ( becklin & zuckerman 1988 ; nakajima et al .",

    "in addition , large numbers of isolated brown dwarfs have been found in the solar neighborhood ( reid & hawley 2000 ; reid 2001 ; kirkpatrick 2001 ) .",
    "these observations have led to controversy regarding the distinction between brown dwarfs and planets , with some suggesting that the lower mass limit for brown dwarfs be defined by the ability to burn deuterium ( mass greater than @xmath213  @xmath3 , burrows et al 1999 ) , and others preferring the definition that a brown dwarf is any substellar object that forms via the same process as a star ( i.e. not from a protoplanetary disk ) .",
    "brown dwarfs are of interest in their own right .",
    "they have compact structures , low temperatures , and atmospheric constituents that are markedly different from low mass stars .",
    "the lowest mass brown dwarfs more closely resemble the gas giant planets than stars , and as such provide insight into the physical and chemical properties of extrasolar giant planets that are at present inaccessible for direct study .",
    "after an initial period of deuterium - burning and , for the more massive brown dwarfs , hydrogen - burning , there is no internal energy source and a brown dwarf evolves without reaching thermal equilibrium .",
    "this leads to age- and mass - dependent spectral types , in contrast to main sequence stars , and indeed eventually to effective temperatures lower than that of any stellar photosphere .",
    "it is generally agreed that the very coolest stars and the warmer brown dwarfs ( 1300  k  @xmath4  t@xmath5  @xmath4  2200  k ) require a new spectral class , commonly known as ` l ' ( martn et al .",

    "the l sequence has been described only on the basis of optical spectra , and hence it has not been not clear if its full extent has been observed .",
    "in addition there are significant differences in the assignments of l subclasses for the latest objects ( e.g. , k99 , m99 ) .",
    "using new and previously published spectra , we have devised a set of infrared flux indices from which we have defined a complete l spectral sequence , a t spectral sequence extending to the coolest known brown dwarfs , and a distinct boundary between the l and t sequences .",
    "one of the new infrared indices provides a firm link between our l sequence and those proposed by m99 and k99 on the basis of optical spectral indices .",
    "the l and t sequences we have created are purely empirical and the ranges of spectral indices describing them are defined so that they progress smoothly through the known l and t dwarfs .",
    "we have made no attempt to model the spectra or to derive physical quantites such as temperature or mass .",
    "some observational gaps remain in the t sequence , and it is quite likely that the sequence will eventually extend to one or more later subclasses as lower temperature objects are found .",

    "the 1.15  @xmath0 m h@xmath26o band does not appear until late in the l sequence ; prior to that the index mainly reflects the slow reddening of the continuum in the 1.11.3  @xmath0 m interval .",
    "it is only suitable for accurate subtyping of the t sequence , where the band strengthens rapidly with later subclass .",
    "we compared the 1.2  @xmath0 m index with a similar 1.1  @xmath0 m water index , which instead uses the short wavelength continuum peak near 1.08  @xmath0 m .",
    "the latter index shows an increase beginning at spectral class l6 , near where the water band first appears . however , there is considerable scatter in the late l  early t range , due to the varying width of the continuum peak ( see e.g. , figs . 3b and 3c ) ; because of this it is less effective than the 1.2  @xmath0 m index . * _ an index to measure the @xmath6 band at 1.5  @xmath0 m . _ the 1.5  @xmath0 m index defined here measures the slope of the long wavelength side of the 1.4  @xmath0 m water band .",
    "its definition is slightly different from that used by r01 ; the shorter wavelength range is closer to the center of the 1.4  @xmath0 m feature ( but still accessible to ground - based telescopes ) , and the longer wavelength range better matches the location of the continuum peak as it appears in t dwarfs ( see fig .",
    "4b ) . it shows a steady increase through both the l and t sequences . * _ an index to measure the @xmath6 band at 1.9  @xmath0 m . _",
    "previous attempts to characterize the 1.9  @xmath0 m h@xmath26o absorption band in l dwarfs have produced mixed results ( tokunaga & kobayashi 1999 ; m99 ; r01 ; testi et al .",
    "2001 ) . we have defined a 2.0  @xmath0 m index that measures the redward slope of the 1.9  @xmath0 m band while avoiding the strong telluric co@xmath26 absorptions centered at 2.01  @xmath0 m and 2.06  @xmath0 m .",
    "thus , our index resembles that of testi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) but spans a shorter wavelength range than that of r01 . like testi et al . , we find that this index suffers more scatter than shorter wavelength @xmath6 indices . also , the range of this index is more compressed than those of the other water indices , the reason for the relative insensitivity of the 2.0  @xmath0 m index to spectral subclass is not clear .",
    "it is probably not due to continuum emission from dust ( allard et al .",
    "2001 ; marley & ackerman 2001 ; burrows et al .",
    "2001 , tsuji 2001 ) , which would dilute the strength of the band , because a similar effect is not seen in the nearby 2.2  @xmath0 m methane band .",
    "we conclude that the 2.0  @xmath0 m index is not a sufficiently accurate indicator of l or t subclass . *",
    "_ indices for the ch@xmath7 bands at 1.6  @xmath0 m and 2.2  @xmath0 m . _",
    "the definition of the h band methane index differs from that used by b01a ; the wavelength range used here includes both the 1.63  @xmath0 m and 1.67@xmath0 m absorption maxima seen in fig .",
    "the index is flat through the l sequence but increases monotonically through the t sequence .",
    "the 2.2  @xmath0 m index differs from those at similar wavelengths employed by r01 and b01a , and is specifically designed to detect the p branch of the @xmath33 methane band , just longward of the q branch which produces a narrow absorption feature at 2.20  @xmath0 m in t dwarfs ( fig .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 methane bands centered at 2.32  @xmath0 m and 2.37  @xmath0 m are somewhat stronger than this band . however , because of the complexity of the spectra of early t dwarfs at 2.32.5  @xmath0 m , with co , ch@xmath7 , and h@xmath26o all absorbing significantly , the first clear sign of methane in the k band is the appearance of the 2.2  @xmath0 m band .",
    "although this band of methane does not become obvious until near the l / t boundary , the index we have defined may be of some use for classifying dwarfs as early as l3 . for late l",
    "subclasses the index is clearly already increasing with spectral subclass , recording an increasing depression of the long wavelength side of the k band , and there is some tendency for this to be occurring at mid l as well .    in summary , we find four indices in the 1.02.5  @xmath0 m interval which are monotonic over sufficiently wide portions of the l / t sequence that they are suitable for accurately classifying l and t dwarfs .",
    "two of the new indices , at 1.2  @xmath0 m and 1.5  @xmath0 m , are associated with water absorptions and two , at 1.6  @xmath0 m and 2.2  @xmath0 m , are associated with methane absorptions . in t dwarfs , all but the h@xmath26o 1.5  @xmath0 m index measure the actual depths of the associated bands ; in the l dwarfs the useful indices measure slopes on the wings of bands ( see fig .  4 ) . very importantly , the 1.5  @xmath0 m water band index is suitable for classification across the entire l ",
    "t sequence and can be linked to the optical continuum indices pc3 and color - d , which are already being used for classifying early to mid l types .",
    "although it has a smaller range of usefulness in the l sequence , the 2.2  @xmath0 m index can be used along with the 1.5  @xmath0 m index to smoothly link the l and t classifications .",
    "we can now use these infrared indices as well as the pc3 and modified color - d indices to define numerical ranges for spectral subclasses .",
    "this is done in table  5 . in defining the subclasses",
    "our intent is : ( 1 ) to make the numerical values of the infrared and optical indices in the l0l5 range generally consistent with existing classifications of m99 and k99 in that range , where the two optical systems agree ; ( 2 ) to define a sensible l / t boundary and extend the l sequence smoothly to it ; and ( 3 ) to define a t sequence , which continues the smooth progression of the indices that are used both for l and t classification and which leaves some room in a system of ten subclasses for as yet undiscovered t dwarfs that are later than any of those currently observed .",
    "table  4 lists the spectral indices and derived classifications for all dwarfs in our sample . for each index listed in table  4 , we determined a classification to @xmath360.5 subclass based on the definitions in table  5 .",
    "we assign a `` .5 '' subclass if the difference of the value of the index and the value at the boundary between subclasses is less than 25% of the range of the index for that subclass , as defined in table  5 . in the final column of the table we have assigned spectral classifications to all l and t objects .",
    "these are based on the unweighted averages of the classifications from all six usable optical and infrared indices for l5 and earlier , and on the averages of only the four infrared indices for later objects .",
    "the classifications of the m dwarfs in table  4 are obtained from the literature , except for sdss  2255 - 00 , which we have classified to be consistent with other late type m dwarfs using the infrared water bands .",
    "figure  5 contains plots of the observed infrared indices versus final assigned spectral class . a large majority of the data points for each index fall within the defined range for that index , demonstrating the accuracy of the technique . in most cases",
    "the l and t classifications are consistent within the overall classification to within about one - half of a subclass and the final classification may be considered accurate to that amount .",
    "larger uncertainties are noted in the last column of table  4 and several of these cases are discussed in section 5.1 .",
    "our classifications of l0l5 dwarfs are in good agreement with those of m99 , k99 , and k00 and the new infrared indices and the 0.6 - 1.0  @xmath0 m continuum indices complement one other in this range of subclasses .",
    "clearly , optical indices should be weighted heavily when classifying such objects . for later l dwarfs ,",
    "however , the 1.5  @xmath0 m and 2.2  @xmath0 m indices yield additional information and are more accurate classification tools than the 0.61.0  @xmath0 m continuum indices .",
    "as shown in table  5 we are unable to define a classification beyond l4 for the pc3 index and beyond l6 for the color - d index .",
    "the dwarfs for which our classifications differ significantly from previously published ones are 2mass  0028 + 15 , where we obtain l3 whereas k00 find l4.5 ; 2mass  0825 + 21 , where we find l6 but k00 and r01 find l7.5 ; 2mass  0310 + 16 and 2mass  0328 + 23 , which we classify as l9 and l9.5 , respectively , whereas k00 obtain l8 for both ; and 2mass  1632 + 19 , which we find to be l7.5 , but m99 classify l6 .",
    "most of these are late - type l dwarfs , where we expect larger discrepancies .",
    "we found that the latest l subclasses described both by m99 and k99 correspond fairly closely to the boundary between l and t classes ( i.e. , to the onset of observable methane absorption in the h and k bands ) .",
    "we also determined that a continued smooth progression of the 1.5  @xmath0 m water band index to this boundary requires several additional l subclasses beyond l5 , and hence matches the k99 classification system ( l0l8 ) better than that of m99 ( l0l6 ) .",
    "therefore , our scheme is loosely correlated with the remainder of the k99 l sequence , with values of both the 1.5  @xmath0 m and 2.2  @xmath0 m indices that roughly match the k99 classifications . however , as discussed above , we found a number of instances in which the values of the two infrared indices implied a different l classification than that provided by k99 .",
    "in addition , as discussed in section 5.2 below , we define an l9 subclass between l8 and t0 .",
    "if generally adopted , this might require a reworking of the optical classification systems for the later l subclasses .    for l types where both the 1.5  @xmath0 m and 2.2@xmath0 m indices are measured ,",
    "the agreement between them is one subclass or better for 15 of the 23 cases ( see table  4 and fig .  6 ) .",
    "agreement generally improves with later subclass .",
    "there are three instances ( gd  165b , denis  0205 - 11 , and denis  1228 - 15 ) for which the two indices give widely discrepant results .",
    "the final uncertainties in those cases are @xmath362 subclasses ( see table  4 ) ; however , in each case our final assignment of spectral class is consistent with k00 and r01 .",
    "each of these dwarfs as well as 2mass  0345 + 25 is in a closely spaced multiple system ( becklin & zuckerman 1988 ; martn , brandner , & basri 1999 ; koerner et al .",
    "1999 ; reid et al .",
    "1999 ) ; perhaps they have additional unseen components which lead to the discrepancies .",
    "they are not plotted in fig .",
    "no detailed classification system for t dwarfs has been proposed previously , although some possibilities have been explored by b01a .",
    "burgasser et al . (",
    "2001b ) are also suggesting a scheme for t dwarfs , which gives similar results as our system .",
    "the latest t dwarfs that we classified are 2mass  1217 - 03 and gl  570d , both t8 .",
    "the former appears marginally earlier in three of the four infrared indices .",
    "the next latest object that we have classified is the t6.5 dwarf 2mass 1047 + 21 .",
    "we have not yet found examples of t5 or t7 dwarfs .    for the t dwarfs the agreement between the four indices we have used for classification",
    "is generally better than the agreement for the indices used for the l dwarfs ( see table  4 and fig .",
    "this is because the indices have much wider ranges of values through the t sequence than through the l sequence .",
    "a single index usually agrees with the final t spectral classification to @xmath360.5 or less .",
    "accuracy of classification increases with later spectral type .",
    "interestingly , the t dwarf with the most uncertain classification in our system is the `` prototype , '' gl  229b , assigned t6 .",
    "its deviations , which are easily seen in fig .  5 ( the most discrepant points at t6 ) , probably are not intrinsic to gl  229b , but rather are related to the difficulty in correcting its spectrum for stray and diffracted light from the nearby primary , which is roughly 10,000 times brighter in the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 bands",
    ". both gl  229b and sdss  1624 + 00 are classified t6 , but we note that both liebert et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and nakajima et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that gl  229b is cooler , based on the widths and strengths of atomic lines and its slightly deeper 1.6  @xmath0 m methane band , from which one might infer that in a different or finer system it might be assigned a later subclass than sdss  1624 + 00 .",
    "taking our spectra at face value , we find that gl  229b is later than sdss  1624 + 00 in its 1.6  @xmath0 m methane index , but earlier in its 1.5  @xmath0 m water and 2.2  @xmath0 m methane indices .",
    "the numerous spectra of late - l dwarfs and early - t dwarfs permit us to examine in detail the onset of methane absorption in brown dwarf spectra and to propose a boundary between the l and t classes .",
    "figure  7 shows a representative selection of late l and early t spectra in the 1.45 - 2.50  @xmath0 m region , where the critical absorption features and indices are situated .",
    "close examination of these spectra shows that the 2.20  @xmath0 m methane absorption is first noticeable at spectral subclass l8 .",
    "the absorption is quite subtle at this subclass , appearing as a slight inflection near 2.20  @xmath0 m . at",
    "somewhat later subclasses a flux minimum is seen at that wavelength . the index measuring",
    "this feature also measures the slope between 2.1@xmath40 m and 2.25  @xmath0 m changing steadily from mid to late l. h@xmath26 collision - induced absorption is expected to be fairly flat across the k band ( borysow et al .",
    "1997 ) , due to the contributions by several h@xmath26 transitions at different wavelengths in the band and the breadths of each absorption profile , and probably is not responsible for this change .",
    "the effect of the 2.20  @xmath0 m ch@xmath7 absorption is to increase the value of the index ; by t3 the ch@xmath7 absorption is very strong .    in contrast , the methane bands at 1.61.7  @xmath0 m are not seen at subclasses l8 and l9 in our system ( see figs . 4b and 7 ) .",
    "the spectra of 2mass  1523 + 30 and sdss  0830 + 48 , which we classify as l8 and l9 , respectively , are flat from 1.60  @xmath0 m to 1.69  @xmath0 m , as are spectra of earlier l subclasses .",
    "the two absorption features at 1.67  @xmath0 m ( due to the 2@xmath41 q branch ) and 1.63  @xmath0 m are first clearly seen at t0 , two subclasses later than where the 2.2  @xmath0 m ( @xmath42 ) band first becomes apparent . unlike the k band methane index , the index measuring the 1.6  @xmath0 m methane bands is only useful for distinguishing t subclasses .",
    "thus the boundary between l and t classifications in our proposed system corresponds to the appearance of methane absorption in the h band ; i.e. , to its earliest appearance in _ both _ the h and k bands .",
    "it is this choice of boundary and the maintainance of smoothly varying infrared indices through it that have led us to define an l9 subclass .",
    "the proposed l / t boundary is preferred over one defined as the onset of ch@xmath7 absorption in the k band , for several reasons : ( 1 ) the noise levels at shorter infrared wavelengths are generally lower than at longer wavelengths ; ( 2 ) the continuum flux levels of brown dwarfs on the l / t boundary are higher at 1.6  @xmath0 m than at 2.2  @xmath0 m ; and ( 3 ) the ( later ) first appearance of methane in the h band creates a more prominent and obvious spectral feature than the ( earlier ) appearance in the k band .",
    "figure  8 shows the spectra of t type dwarfs from t0 through t8 , with adjacent spectra spaced by one subclass ( except for the gaps between t4.5 and t6 and between t6 and t8 ) .",
    "the spectra show a smooth progression through the sequence , as was the intention when the ranges of indices were designed for each subclass .",
    "note that the 1.5  @xmath0 m index measures the slope of the shoulder of the 1.4  @xmath0 m water band , whereas the other three indices measure the actual depths of the associated features ( see fig .",
    "however , it is apparent from fig .",
    "8 , and not surprising , that increasing slope of the shoulders of the 1.4  @xmath0 m water band also corresponds to a steady deepening of that band with later subclass .",
    "figure  9 shows the modified color - d optical index plotted against the 1.5  @xmath0 m index for all isolated l dwarfs in which both indices were measured .",
    "the color - d index saturates above l6 , as illustrated in the figure . for 7",
    "of 8 of the objects in the l0l6 range the agreement between the two indices is better than one subclass , and in half it is better than one - half subclass .",
    "the discrepant object is 2mass  0036 + 18 , whose color - d classification is l2.5 and the whose 1.5  @xmath0 m and 2.2  @xmath0 m classifications are l4.5 and l5 , respectively .",
    "( note that k00 have classified this object as l3.5 and that our overall classification is l4 . )",
    "the discrepant case notwithstanding , the good correlation of these indices in the l0-l6 range permits a graceful transition between the optical and infrared classification schemes .",
    "more data and further comparison of the 1.5  @xmath0 m index with other optical indices are needed to strengthen this link between the two classification schemes .",
    "we have developed a system for classifying l and t dwarfs , based largely on four newly defined spectral indices in the 1.0 - 2.5  @xmath0 m range , and have used it to classify objects from l0 to t8 .",
    "two new indices we use are associated with the 1.15 and 1.4  @xmath0 m water bands and two are associated with the 1.65 and 2.2  @xmath0 m methane bands . at l0l6",
    "the new classification system gives consistent results with the optical systems of m99 and k99 , and it appears that they can be accurately aligned using the 1.5  @xmath0 m water and modified color - d ( and possibly other optical ) indices . for later l types and all t types , the new indices give satisfactory and self - consistent results .",
    "an l classification based on either the 1.5  @xmath0 m or 2.2  @xmath0 m index is usually accurate to within @xmath361 subclass , and a t classification using any one of the four infrared indices is usually accurate to within @xmath360.5 subclass .",
    "the boundary between the l and t classes has been thoroughly investigated .",
    "we define the boundary to be the appearance of methane absorption in the h band , which occurs approximately two spectral subclasses after its appearance in the k band .",
    "spectra of additional l and t dwarfs are needed to refine the definitions of the subclasses .",
    "nevertheless , as defined here the l sequence is complete , extending from l0 to l9.5 and smoothly connecting to the t sequence .",
    "the same can not be said of the t sequence , as objects later than t8 , yet to be observed , should exist . observing the full extent of the t sequence and determining whether the present classification system is acceptable or requires compression , or a more radical alteration , needs the detection and spectral study of cooler and presumably fainter dwarfs than currently found .",
    "the range of effective temperatures of t0-t8 dwarfs is 8001300  k ( geballe et al .",
    "2001a ; l01b ) .",
    "radical changes in the 1.02.5@xmath40 m spectrum should not occur until temperatures are low enough that water vapor condenses , probably at t@xmath5  @xmath2  500  k ( marley & ackerman 2001 ) .",
    "hence , compression of the classification system defined here is a possibility .",
    "finally , clear understandings of the effects of varying gravity , rotation , dust , and metal abundance , and incorporating them into a multi - dimensional classification system will require higher precision and probably higher resolution spectra than reported here , together with accurate model atmospheres and spectra .",
    "we thank the 2mass group ( a. j. burgasser , j. d. kirkpatrick , m. e. brown , i. n. reid and colleagues ) for many valuable discussions on spectral typing , for providing data before publication , and for communicating their spectral sequence for l and t dwarfs before publication.this shared information allowed us to make a consistent first set of t dwarf spectral classifications prior to more detailed analysis .",
