    "entropy @xmath0 as a function of extensive variables characterizes macroscopic properties of materials in a unified manner @xcite",
    ". its functional form for a given material is completely determined by thermodynamic measurements of the heat capacity , the compressibility and the other relevant susceptibilities .",
    "let @xmath1 be an unconstrained variable of a composite isolated system .",
    "we denote the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 by @xmath2 .",
    "then , the equilibrium value of @xmath1 is determined by @xmath3 , \\label{ext}\\ ] ] which is an example of the variational principle of thermodynamics .",
    "furthermore , according to einstein s fluctuation theory @xcite , the probability density of @xmath1 is expressed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath6 represents the asymptotic equivalence of the exponential factor in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath7 be the number of the degrees of freedom .",
    "then , the scaled entropy @xmath8 with @xmath9 fixed satisfies @xmath10 in the probability theory , the right - hand side provides a large deviation function ( up to the minus sign ) @xcite .",
    "that is , the scaled entropy @xmath11 is equivalent to the large deviation function .",
    "now , suppose that the scaled entropy @xmath11 is defined by ( [ rate ] ) with the principle of the equal weight for microscopic states .",
    "then , the variational principle ( [ ext ] ) can be derived from the definition .",
    "a surprise in this approach is that the entropy thus defined characterizes thermodynamic properties completely through the fundamental relation of thermodynamics . after establishing the connection to thermodynamics ,",
    "one can obtain the scaled entropy by thermodynamic measurements .",
    "in other words , the large deviation function , which characterizes macroscopic fluctuations , is obtained without measuring fluctuations .",
    "such formulas are not restricted to the case of fluctuations in isolated systems . as demonstrated for a simple model in appendix [ appendix_thermodynamics ] ,",
    "several formulas are derived .",
    "one example is that a scaled cumulant generating function of a thermodynamic variable , which is given by the legendre transform of the large deviation function , is related to a free energy density in thermodynamics . from this relation ,",
    "it is found that the derivative of the scaled cumulant generating function with respect to its argument is equal to the expectation value of the thermodynamic variable in a modified system with an extra external force added .",
    "see ( [ g_equilibrium ] ) for such an example .",
    "the relations between large deviation functions and thermodynamic functions are thought to be well - known , and the relations lead to fluctuation - response relations , one of which , connects the susceptibility and the intensity of fluctuations of magnetization @xcite .",
    "the main difference of non - equilibrium systems from equilibrium systems is the existence of a current . in particular ,",
    "the expectation value of the current in a linear response regime is connected with the intensity of fluctuations of time - averaged current in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this is one of fluctuation - dissipation relations , which might correspond to fluctuation - response relations in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "since the time - averaged current appears to be important at least for small fluctuations in the linear response regime , it is natural to consider the large deviation function of time - averaged current",
    ". then , from the analogy with thermodynamics , one may expect that there is a formula that connects the large deviation function with a macroscopic quantity and that the fluctuation - dissipation relations are derived from the formula when the linear response regime is focused on .",
    "indeed , onsager and onsager - machlup attempted to express the large deviation function of time - averaged current in terms of dissipation functions @xcite , as pointed out by oono @xcite .",
    "this is successful for small fluctuations in the linear response regime , but the expression can not be applied to general cases with large fluctuations .    in the last two decades",
    ", the understanding of the large deviation function of time - averaged current has been substantially developed .",
    "one remarkable result is the discovery of the fluctuation theorem which represents a simple and beautiful symmetry property of the large deviation function of time - averaged entropy production @xcite .",
    "the symmetry property was understood from the microscopic reversibility of the system and it was generalized to identities for any quantities @xcite .",
    "this progress enables us to revisit a linear response theory and to re - derive known formulas including a non - linear response formula @xcite and an expression of steady state distribution @xcite .",
    "@xcite as a review of these re - derivations .",
    "in addition to the re - derivation of the known formulas , the symmetry property plays an essential role in deriving an extension of the clausius relation @xcite on the basis of a neat expression of steady state distribution @xcite . as another direction of the progress",
    ", the large deviation function of time - averaged current was explicitly calculated for lattice models @xcite .",
    "the results evolved into a variational form , which was called an additivity principle @xcite . when the system behavior is assumed to be described by fluctuating hydrodynamics ,",
    "the condition for the validity of the additivity principle can be derived from the analysis of the path - integral expression @xcite .",
    "note that the additivity principle is less universal than the fluctuation theorem , but still characterizes a universal aspect of the large deviation functions of time - averaged current in a wide range class of systems .",
    "@xcite for a recent related study .    based on these developments ,",
    "we consider a possibility that the large deviation function of time - averaged current is expressed by a time - averaged quantity as if the framework corresponds to einstein s fluctuation theory .",
    "this formula , if it exists , is regarded as an extension of onsager s theory to that valid even for large fluctuations .",
    "although the motivation seems natural , the problem would not be solved easily . nevertheless , since a new operational variational principle associated with the large deviation function of time - averaged current has been found recently @xcite , it is a good opportunity to study the problem .",
    "in this paper , specifically , we study interacting brownian particles under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the motion of the particles are assumed to be described by a set of langevin equations .",
    "we then consider the large deviation function of time - averaged velocity of the particles .",
    "the main results in this paper are formulas ( [ cumulantvariational_expression ] ) and ( [ mainclaim_of_the_paper ] ) .",
    "the formula ( [ cumulantvariational_expression ] ) indicates that the scaled cumulant generating function , which is given by the legendre transform of the large deviation function , is determined from a variational function in a modified system with an inhomogeneous external force added .",
    "essentially the same formula was reported in ref .",
    "the formula ( [ mainclaim_of_the_paper ] ) claims that the derivative of the scaled cumulant generating function is equal to the time - averaged velocity in the modified system , which corresponds to ( [ g_equilibrium ] ) in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the formula ( [ mainclaim_of_the_paper ] ) also turns out to be an extension of the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "since these new formulas take simple forms , we expect that our results advance the understanding of large deviation function of time - averaged quantity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section_model ] , we introduce a model and define quantities we study in this paper . in section [ section_main ] , we first summarize main results of the paper and after that we derive them . in section",
    "[ section_whatismaximized ] , we address three remarks on the variational function that appears in our main results . concretely , we re -",
    "express the variational function in terms of entropy production rates , mention a similarity with the donsker - varadhan formula , and explain a connection to the principle of the least dissipation of energy . in section [ section_application ]",
    ", we present a few applications of our formula by restricting our study to a single brownian particle on a ring .",
    "first , on the basis of our formula , we re - derive exact formulas of the diffusion constant and the mobility in a compact manner .",
    "second , starting from our formula , we show a variational expression associated with an additivity principle .",
    "third , we propose a method for experimentally obtaining the scaled cumulant generating function .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "some technical details and related subjects are discussed in appendices . in the argument below , the boltzmann constant @xmath5 is set to unity .",
    "we consider @xmath7 colloidal particles immersed in a solvent at temperature @xmath12 .",
    "we describe the system by a set of positions of the particles in a @xmath13-dimensional region @xmath14 . for mathematical simplicity ,",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions . as a typical example",
    ", one may consider a three - dimensional region , where one direction is confined by walls and no walls in other directions .",
    "even such a case is included in our model by setting up a periodic potential whose height is extremely large at the walls .",
    "another example of the region @xmath14 is a one - dimensional circuit which can be generated by an optical potential .",

    "we also express the position of the @xmath18-th particle by the @xmath13-dimensional vector @xmath21 .",
    "the force acting on the particles consists of three types of force , ( i ) an external force , ( ii ) an interaction force exerted from other particles , and ( iii ) a force from solvent molecules . in ( i ) , the external force is further divided into a homogeneous part @xmath22 and a periodic part determined by a potential @xmath23 . since the existence of @xmath24 makes the system out of equilibrium , we call @xmath24 a driving force . in ( ii ) , the interaction force is determined by a two - body interaction potential @xmath25 between the @xmath18-th particle and the @xmath17-th particle under the assumption that three- and higher - body interactions among particles are not taken into account .",
