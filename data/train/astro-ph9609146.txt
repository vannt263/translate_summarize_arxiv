    "it remains largely unexplained why qsos are suddenly quenched at @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "turner 1991 , fukugita & turner 1996 ) . a tempting possibility that low @xmath22 seyfert galaxies may be low luminosity remnants of qsos",
    "is ruled out simply due to the fact that the former are more abundant than the latter at least by an order of magnitude ( huchra & burg 1992 ) .",

    "we suggest that this rapid growth itself may directly affect the qsos evolution .",
    "the basic idea is that the massive black holes , accreting at a scaled accretion rate @xmath32 below a certain critical rate @xmath33 ( narayan & yi 1995b ) , emit radiation with an efficiency @xmath34 .",
    "although the idea of the low accretion efficiency ( rees et al .",
    "1982 ) has occasionally been mentioned , the lack of a self - consistent model has been a major obstacle . since @xmath4 increases due to accretion ( even when @xmath3 remains nearly constant ) , @xmath35 decreases and the qsos luminosity decrease could be a direct result of the rapid mass accretion .",
    "we suggest that the transition in accretion flow from high efficiency ( @xmath36 ) to low efficiency ( @xmath37 ) flows could naturally explain the major properties of the x - ray luminosity evolution of qso population ( yi 1996 ) .",
    "the idea of transition in accretion flow hinges on the recently proven stability of the advection - dominated flows ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995ab , abramowitz et al .",
    "1995 , chen et al .",
    "1995 ) . as the accretion rate falls , the density of the accreting plasma drops to a point where the coulomb ion - electron energy transfer becomes inefficient compared with the rate of viscous heating on ions ( rees et al .",
    "1982 ) . in the absence of other couplings ,",
    "the accretion flow becomes a two temperature plasma with a very low radiative cooling efficiency ( narayan & yi 1995b , rees 1982 ) and most of accretion energy is lost into black holes through advection .",
    "optically thin ( magnetized ) advection - dominated flows emit synchrotron ( in radio ) and comptonized synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission ( in x - ray ) resulting in characteristically flat spectra .",

    "fabian and rees ( 1995 ) have also suggested that dim galactic nuclei in large elliptical galaxies ( due to low efficiency advection - dominated flows ) contain remnants of luminous qsos .",
    "an accretion flow enters the low efficiency regime at a critical accretion rate , @xmath41 , which is primarily determined by @xmath6 ( narayan & yi 1995b ) , @xmath42 for @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the radial distance and @xmath45 . for @xmath46 , @xmath47 since most of the accretion energy is dissipated at @xmath48 , the critical rate given in eq .",

    "when @xmath49 , the accretion flow takes the form of high efficiency ( i.e. @xmath50 ) or @xmath51 for @xmath52 , the low efficiency is approximately described by the luminosity @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "we take @xmath55 or @xmath56 and @xmath57 for our discussions ( narayan & yi 1995b ) . unless the accretion rate rapidly increases toward the present epoch ,",
    "the growth of black holes always tend to decrease @xmath58 , which naturally drives the transition .",
    "the overall evolution takes the form of the the pure luminosity evolution .",
    "the direct comparison with the observed x - ray evolution is complicated by the uncertainties in x - ray emission from luminous qsos .",
    "the conventional thin disks ( with high efficiency ) have the effective disk temperatures @xmath59 k and hence can not emit x - rays efficiently ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "we assume that a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity is emitted as x - rays ( presumably from accretion disk coronae ) and that @xmath25 represents this uncertainty .",
    "the advection - dominated hot flows differ from the thin disks as the former emit hard x - rays up to several @xmath60 kev . as long as most of the accretion flow is advection - dominated , the emission spectra are characteristically flat , i.e. luminosity per decade of frequency is roughly constant ( e.g. narayan et al .",
    "1995 , lasota et al .",
    "the x - ray luminosity can be approximated as a fixed fraction of the total luminosity . in our discussions",
    ", we simply assume that the observed x - ray luminosity is proportional to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we caution that our assumption could introduce serious errors if the x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratio is a complex function of some yet unknown parameters such as @xmath61 , @xmath3 , or @xmath62 .",
    "for instance , if the accretion flow contains a thin disk in the outer region ( eq .",

    "<S> we present a model for the cosmological evolution of quasars ( qsos ) under the assumption that they are powered by massive accreting black holes . </S>",
    "<S> accretion flows around massive black holes make a transition from high radiative efficiency ( @xmath0 ) to low efficiency , advection - dominated flows when @xmath1 falls below the critical rate @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath4 is the usual eddington rate with the nominal @xmath5 efficiency , and @xmath6 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we identify this transition with the observed break at a redshift @xmath7 in the qsos x - ray luminosity evolution . </S>",
    "<S> growth of black holes through accretion could naturally lead to such a transition at a critical redshift @xmath8 , provided that most of high redshift qsos appear with near eddington luminosities at @xmath9 and the accretion rates decline over the hubble time in a roughly synchronous manner . before the transition , the qsos luminosities ( with a high efficiency ) slowly decrease and after the transition at @xmath10 , the qso luminosities evolve approximately as @xmath11 where @xmath12 gradually varies from @xmath13 to @xmath14 around @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the results depend on the details of the qso x - ray emission mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some further implications . </S>"
