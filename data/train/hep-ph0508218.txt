    "this conspiracy disappears : the hard configurations that occupy most of the phase volume in the photon wave function begin to dominate due to the rapid increase of the hard cross sections with the energy .",
    "this corresponds to the serious change of the @xmath8 dependence of the structure functions to the regime where @xmath33 , for the review and references see ref .",
    "in the new regime hard pqcd phenomena should dominate in the structure functions .",
    "the cross section of the diffractive production of quark - gluon system with large mass determines the triple ladder vertex which enters our calculations . in order to simplify our task",
    "we restrict ourselves to the kinematics where the wave function of the longitudinally polarized photon @xmath34 is dominated by the configurations of the constituents with large transverse momenta and large invariant mass  the hard perturbative qcd analogue of the triple - reggeon limit .",
    "the account of this phenomenon helps to evaluate the triple reggeon vertex near the black disk limit where the leading logarithmic approximations are violated .",
    "a necessary kinematical condition of the applicability of our method is @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 can be determined from the condition that the contribution of one ladder in dipole ",
    "dipole scattering at central impact parameters is near the black disk limit in the leading twist approximation .",
    "this inequality is just the condition for the existence of the triple - regge limit and it is the main kinematical limitation of our approach .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that some of the challenges discussed above can be met for one - scale hard small @xmath0 processes , such as @xmath37  hadrons , @xmath38 , etc .",
    "we restrict ourselves by the consideration of the one - scale hard processes where the contribution into the amplitude of the qcd evolution with scale is suppressed .",
    "consequently the factorization of the information on the wave functions of the projectile and target from the interaction , similar to the one that occurs in the regge pole exchanges , becomes a reasonable approximation .",
    "the rapid increase of the perturbative qcd amplitudes with energy leads to even more rapid increase of the role of the shadowing effects .",
    "it was found long ago that the generalization of the technology of calculations of shadowing effects , encoded in the reggeon field theory , may appear useful for the description of the small @xmath0 processes @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the latter approach , which accounts for any diffractive processes , leads to the effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "the evident advantage of the eft , as compared to models based on elastic eikonal approximation ( see i.e. ref .",
    "@xcite ) is in the possibility to account for the whole variety of rescattering effects , and to ensure the energy -momentum conservation .",
    "in addition , we will show in this paper , that the transition to the black disk limit ( bdl ) in hard processes has a certain resemblance to a critical phenomena .",
    "note that the soft qcd contribution to the scattering processes is almost absent in the chosen processes .",
    "this suppression is achieved by the choice of the longitudinally polarized highly virtual photons as the projectile and the target .",
    "although the method developed in the paper is inapplicable beyond the one scale hard processes , the new qcd phenomena we found in the paper may appear important for the many - scale hard processes as well .    to account for the coherence of the high - energy processes and the rapid increase with energy of the amplitudes of the hard small-@xmath0 processes ,",
    "we construct an effective field theory ( eft ) of the interacting perturbative colorless ladders .",
    "the evident advantage of this approach is the significant reduction of the number of variables in the problem and the mapping of the physics of the coherent processes into the framework resembling the statistical models .",
    "( this approach is in the spirit of the statistical models of critical phenomena that account for the interactions between the major modes only .",
    "the specifics of the physics of the large longitudinal distances is included in the concept of the quasiparticle . )",
    "the interaction between the quasiparticles , when the amplitudes of the hard processes are near the unitarity limit , can be easily evaluated within the wkb approximation .",
    "the use of the wkb approximation is justified by the smallness of the running coupling constant in the perturbative qcd .",
    "we show that account of the running coupling constant helps to establish the dominance of the triple - ladder vertex ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the smallness of the multiladder vertices in pqcd implies that the basic phenomena that characterizes the black disk limit should be insensitive to the restriction by the triple - ladder vertex .",
    "this observation helps to fix the form of the lagrangian of the eft near the unitarity limit .    since @xmath39 in pqcd ,",
    "the quasiparticle of the eft is a tachyon : the singularities in the complex angular - momentum plane are located at @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "such a behavior is in the evident conflict with the bound for the total cross section of a small dipole ",
    "dipole scattering , that follows from the causality and conservation of probability in qcd .",
    "the causality and unitarity of the @xmath42 matrix , however , are not necessarily valid in the perturbative qcd vacuum . the rapid increase of the amplitude with energy predicted by the perturbative qcd approximations ( i.e. the presence of the tachyon in the eft ) reflects a rapid transition from the false , perturbative vacuum to the nonperturbative , physical vacuum . to visualize this phenomenon",
    "it is useful to consider physical processes in coordinate space @xcite .",
    "so these approximations should fail to predict actual energy dependence of amplitudes of physical processes which is nonperturbative phenomenon .",
    "we find in the paper that account of nonlinear phenomena leads to serious restructuring of produced qcd states besides the onset of black disk limit .",
    "with the lagrangian of the eft at hand , we may identify the order parameter relevant for the critical phenomena in small-@xmath0 processes : the order parameter is the condensate of the quasiparticles , that are the pqcd ladders .",
    "we find the new nonperturbative phenomena in the regime of the strong interaction with a small coupling constant , including the new nonperturbative classical fields , whose effects are @xmath43 , the color inflation due to the tunneling transitions , the zero modes in the dominant classical fields and related massless particles -``phonons '' in the eft , and the formation of a color network where the overlapping quasiparticles ( ladders ) do exchange the colored constituents .",
    "the approach developed in this paper differs from the eft suggested in ref .",
    "the major practical differences are that we restrict ourselves by one scale hard processes only , in the dominance in the wkb approximation of the tunneling transitions and the quantum fluctuations around them , while the contribution of the quantum loops calculated near the vacuum of the pqcd vacuum is negligible .",
    "another fundamental difference from the approach of @xcite as well as from the color glass condensate approaches ( cf .",
    "reviews @xcite ) is in the account of the important role played by the diffusion to large impact parameters . near the unitarity limit this diffusion leads to the fast rise of structure functions with energy @xcite . in our paper",
    "we take into account the universal gribov diffusion related to randomness of radiation @xcite , but neglect the diffusion to large distances due to the running coupling constant and the diffusion to small distances related to the increase of the final state phase volume .",
    "the latter two types of diffusion were shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be strongly suppressed after an account of the next - to - leading order bfkl type approximation .",
    "there is no systematic evaluation of these effects because of the sensitivity to the restriction of the phase volume of the produced particles and related sensitivity to nlo approximations .    in this paper",
    "we heavily use results of analysis of particular preqcd model of reggeon field theory obtained in @xcite .",
    "the major difference from these papers is that dominance of triple ladder vertex is justified in qcd . besides we found that eft predicts significant overlap between ladders near bdl . in the appendix",
    "a we account for the exchange of the constituents between the overlapping ladders . at sufficiently small @xmath0",
    "this leads to the formation of the color network instead of a system of ladders ( see discussion in appendix a ) .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "2 we introduce the concept of the pqcd ladder as the quasiparticle of the eft .",
    "we explain the hierarchy among the multiladder vertices in pqcd ( see also appendix  b ) .",
    "we show that a restriction to the triple - ladder vertex evaluated within the physical vacuum is sufficient for the theoretical description of the phenomena near the unitarity transition , and we construct the lagrangian of the eft . in sections  3 and  4",
    "we discover and analyze the analogies with the critical phenomena . in section  5",
    "we briefly discuss observable phenomena that follow from the solution of the effective field theory .",
    "our results are summarized in the conclusion . in appendix",
    "a we show that color is confined within ladders in the tube of the small transverse size .",
    "we argue that a color network appears once the ladders overlap significantly in space . in appendix",
    "b we present the estimates of the multiladder vertices within the physical vacuum .",
    "the construction of an effective field theory requires the knowledge of the dominant degrees of freedom  the quasiparticles  and their interactions .",
    "we assume , based on the linear pqcd calculations , that the major degrees of freedom are the pqcd color - singlet ladders with the two - gluon state in the @xmath44 channel , that we will denote the _",
    "`` pomeron''_. ( the four gluon exchange , where each pair of gluons forms an @xmath45 representation of the su(3)@xmath46 , is included in this pomeron . )",
    "such a definition is of common use , although the pqcd `` pomeron '' has no direct relation to the regge - pole pomeron exchange relevant for the successful description of the phenomena dominated by the nonperturbative soft qcd . in principle , the intercept of `` pomeron '' depends on @xmath8 in pqcd .",
    "however at very small @xmath0 the @xmath8 dependence of `` pomeron '' intercept becomes weak @xcite , and the factorization of information on projectile and target is valid for a ladder because of the disappearance of the color transparency phenomenon .",
    "the contribution of the pqcd ladders that have 4 , 6 , @xmath47 gluons in the @xmath44 channel where pairs of gluons form the color representations @xmath48 , 10 , @xmath49 , or 27 can not be topologically and analytically reduced to the contribution of the two - gluon exchange ladder . in principle",
    "it is necessary to introduce the new varieties of quasiparticles into the hamiltonian of the eft and to account for their interactions .",
    "however , the smallness of the running coupling constant leads to the hierarchy of the interactions especially within large @xmath50 limit evaluated within the physical vacuum .",
    "the account of this hierarchy justifies the neglect of this kind of quasiparticles .",
    "in particular , it is well known that the two - gluon colorless ladder has maximal @xmath51 as compared to the colored ladders .",
    "the contributions of all quasiparticles except the ladders with the two gluon color singlet intermediate states in @xmath44 channel can be neglected even near the unitarity limit , where the amplitudes of the high - energy processes are close to the maximum permitted by the probability conservation .",
    "when the contribution of one ladder to the amplitude becomes large it is necessary to take into account the shadowing effects .",
    "the technology of the evaluation of the rescattering effects due to the iterations of the pqcd ladder is the adaptation to pqcd of methods of the reggeon field theory(rft ) @xcite .",
    "the account of the shadowing effects leads to the 2 + 1 dimensional field theory where variables are the position of the leading singularity in the angular momentum plane@xmath52 and the transverse momentum @xmath53 .",
    "the equivalent but more convenient approach to the problem considered in the paper is to use the description in terms of the variables @xmath54 -rapidity and @xmath55 impact parameter .",
    "the effective field theory includes the `` pomeron '' loops and all variety of multi-``pomeron '' vertices .",
    "technologically it is more convenient to find the lagrangian of the eft rather than to evaluate the particular set of diagrams , cf .",
    "consequently , we may restrict ourselves to the brief description of the lagrangian of the eft near the unitarity limit .",
    "the equations of the eft can be derived as the lagrange equations of motion from an effective lagrangian that contains five terms , l = l_0-l_1-l_2-l_3 -l_4 . [ 1 ] the first three terms have a straightforward interpretation in the case of noninteracting quasiparticles , while the other terms describe interactions between quasiparticles and with the virtual photon as the source .",
    "the @xmath56 , @xmath57 and  @xmath58 follow from the mellin transformation of the green function of the free quasiparticle , @xmath59^{-1}$ ] , in the plane of the complex angular momentum @xmath60 in the crossed channel .",
    "thus l_0=(q_y p -p_y q ) , [ 2 ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the quasiparticle fields .",

    "@xmath67 is the `` mass '' term , l_1=-(q^2 ) pq .",
    "[ 3 ] this term accounts for the rise of the structure functions with energy as derived for the scattering of two dipoles within the lt approximation , f_2p(x , q^2 ) ,  xg_p(x , q^2)~(x_0/x)^(q^2 ) , with @xmath68 .",

    "the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath8 is rather weak at sufficiently small x @xcite .",
    "note also slow convergence of pqcd effects .",
    "the term @xmath71 describes the dependence on the collision energy of the essential impact parameters .",
    "we assume that it has the form : l_2=_pp_bq .",

    "the slope @xmath72 is small within the perturbative qcd . within the approximation , that takes into account the @xmath8 evolution ,",
    "the running of the coupling constant , and to some extent the energy - momentum conservation , the fast qcd evolution to small and large distances ( that exists beyond gribov diffusion ) is suppressed @xcite , and we can neglect it .",
    "the gribov diffusion to large impact parameters due to randomness of gluon radiation @xcite is still there .",
    "the parametric estimate gives : @xmath74 . at the same time , near the unitarity limit the additional mechanism ( complementary to gribov diffusion ) of increase with energy of essential impact parameters , due to the fast increase of the amplitudes with energy , begins to play an important role @xcite .",
    "there the effective @xmath72 can not be negligible but it is difficult to evaluate it because of the sensitivity to the uncalculated nonleading order terms in the running coupling constant , etc .",
    "since the exact form of @xmath71 is unknown at present it is chosen in the paper in the simplest form .",
    "the evaluation of the multi - pomeron vertices near the unitarity limit ( see appendix b ) shows that within the wkb approximation , the relative contribution of the fourth and higher multi - pomeron vertices is suppressed by the powers of @xmath1 compared to the triple - ladder term . thus for the description of hard qcd phenomena it should be sufficient to restrict ourselves to the triple - ladder interaction .    near the unitarity limit the dominant contribution into the triple-``pomeron '' vertex @xmath75 : l_3=pq(p+q ) , [ 11 ] is given by the component of the virtual photon wave function having transverse size @xmath76 .",
    "really at moderately small @xmath0 soft qcd and pqcd components of the photon wave function give comparable contributions into the total cross section and cross section of the diffraction .",
    "this is due to the conspiracy of small probability of the soft component @xmath77 and the large cross section of the soft component interaction with a target .",
    "the probability of a hard component in the virtual photon wave function is @xmath78 but the cross section of its interaction with a hadron target is @xmath77 - the aligned jet model @xcite .",
    "this conspiracy disappears at sufficiently small @xmath0 as the consequence of the rapid increase with the energy of the cross sections of the hard processes .",
    "so small @xmath0 , and therefore small @xmath75 processes are dominated by hard qcd , for the review and references see ref . @xcite . then at moderately small @xmath0 the vertex @xmath75 is determined by the interplay of the soft and hard qcd dynamics .",
    "however with the decrease of @xmath0 in the kinematics near the black disk limit the vertex @xmath75 should be dominated by the hard qcd .    in the absence of a detailed calculation , we limit ourselves to the dimensional estimate of @xmath75 and neglect any possible weak dependence of the coupling @xmath75 on @xmath54 and on @xmath44 . in the lowest order in the coupling",

    "@xcite where the bfkl approximation arises as the small @xmath0 limit of pqcd series where separation of scales is made before summing them . in this case for single scale hard processes @xmath75 is dominated by hard pqcd effects . besides the nonperturbative contribution into the three `` pomeron '' vertex",
    "is suppressed by sudakov form factors , and by the dominance of the hard regime near the black disk limit , cf . the above discussion .",
    "the existence ( but not the properties ) of the new qcd phenomena is not sensitive to the actual value of @xmath81 which is effectively the characteristic transverse momentum of the constituents of the pqcd ladder where it splits into the two new ones .    a tricky point in the evaluation of the `` multi - pomeron '' vertices within",
    "the pqcd is the necessity to account for causality and energy - momentum conservation .",
    "diagrams where singularities are located on the same side of the contour of integration in the energy plane ( in particular eikonal diagrams ) are suppressed by the powers of energy @xcite ) .",
    "so we neglect the eikonal - type inelastic rescatterings since a bare particle may have one inelastic collision and any number of elastic collisions . for the interactions that rapidly increase with the energy , the requirements of the causality , the positivity of the probability for the physical processes , and the energy - momentum conservation can be hardly satisfied within such a set of diagrams @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the contribution of rescatterings due to an inelastic diffraction into the final state with the invariant mass @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , is not too small .",

    "note that this function is localized in the space of relative transverse distances between the constituents as @xmath93 and in the space of rapidities @xmath54 .",
    "since the distribution over @xmath89 is centered at @xmath94 in the case of the wave function of the longitudinally polarized photon , we can safely assume that this contribution into the source corresponds to the finite @xmath54 negligible as compared to the full rapidity span .",

    "<S> we argue that at sufficiently small bjorken @xmath0 where pqcd amplitudes rapidly increase with energy and violate probability conservation the shadowing effects in the single - scale small @xmath0 hard qcd processes can be described by an effective quantum field theory of interacting quasiparticles perturbative qcd ladders . </S>",
    "<S> we find , within the wkb approximation , that the smallness of the qcd coupling constant ensures the hierarchy among many - quasiparticle interactions evaluated within the physical vacuum and in particular , the dominance in the lagrangian of the triple quasiparticle interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it is explained that the effective field theory considered near the perturbative qcd vacuum contains a tachyon relevant for the divergency of the perturbative qcd series at sufficiently small @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the equations of motion of the effective field theory within the wkb approximation and find the physical vacuum and the transitions between the false ( perturbative ) and physical vacua . </S>",
    "<S> classical solutions which dominate transitions between the false and physical vacua are kinks that can not be decomposed into perturbative series over the powers of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these kinks lead to color inflation and the bose - einstein condensation of quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the account of the quantum fluctuations around the wkb solution reveals the appearance of the `` massless '' particles `` phonons '' . </S>",
    "<S> it is explained that `` phonons '' are relevant for the black disk behavior of cross sections of small @xmath0 processes . </S>",
    "<S> the bose - einstein condensation of the ladders produces a color network occupying a `` macroscopic '' longitudinal volume . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss briefly the possible detection of new qcd effects . </S>",
    "<S> we outline albeit briefly the relationship between the small @xmath0 hard qcd processes and the coherent critical phenomena . </S>"
