    "the internal diffusion - limited aggregation ( internal dla ) was introduced by meakin and deutch @xcite as a model of cluster growth phenomena . given a connected cluster of @xmath2 sites",
    "@xmath3 containing the origin , let @xmath4 be a cluster obtained by a random walk starting at the origin and stopping when the walker first exits @xmath5 , so that the site @xmath6 is the endpoint of the walk .",
    "after each stop , the walker returns to the origin and the process continues .",
    "if one thinks of the random walk as a trail of a diffusing particle , @xmath5 is the cluster of @xmath2 particles delivering from an unrestricted source at the origin .",
    "the question is the shape of the cluster @xmath5 and the smoothness of its boundary for large @xmath2 if one starts from @xmath7 .",
    "lawler et al @xcite showed that the rescaled shape of @xmath5 is a ball for any dimension . in @xcite",
    ", lawler proved that fluctuations of boundaries grow with the ball radius @xmath1 not faster than @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant .",
    "asselah and gaudillire @xcite and independently jerison , levine and sheffield @xcite presented the new bound @xmath10 on the maximum fluctuations for two dimensions and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "it is intuitively clear that the smoothness of boundaries in the internal dla depends on statistical properties of the walk inside the cluster of the visited sites .",
    "propp was the first who proposed to replace the simple random walk in the two - dimensional aggregation by a deterministic process called the rotor - router walk @xcite .",
    "the rotor mechanism introduced in @xcite works as follows .",
    "at each site of the square lattice there is a rotor pointing to one of four cardinal directions n , e , s , w . at each time step , the walker arriving at a lattice site rotates the rotor in this site clockwise by 90 degrees and takes a step in the new direction .",
    "the rotor rule leads to essential changes of properties of the walk trajectories , and as a consequence , to changes in the aggregation process .",
    "the rotor - router internal aggregation for the @xmath13-dimensional lattice was considered by levine and peres , who proved that the asymptotic shape of the cluster remains a ball as in the internal dla @xcite .",
    "the in - radius of the set of sites occupied by the aggregation cluster is at least @xmath14 and the out - radius is at most @xmath15 for any @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "recently , levine and peres @xcite have presented the stronger result @xmath17 for the outer bound as well .",
    "these bounds can be compared with the results for the clusters in the divisible sandpile formed from a pile of a given mass at the origin .",
    "fluctuations of the radius @xmath1 of the domain occupied by sand are restricted by constants that do not depend on @xmath1 . in @xcite ,",
    "levine and peres asked the question whether the similar estimations hold for the rotor - router aggregation where the near perfect circularity was observed in numerical simulations . in this paper",
    ", we will prove that the boundary fluctuations of a constant width take place in a rotor - router aggregation model for a specific geometry , namely , for a semi - infinite cylinder .",
    "the standard internal dla for cylinders was analysed by jerison , levine and sheffield in @xcite .",
    "the cylinder was taken as the square @xmath18 lattice that is periodic in the horizontal direction and extends to infinity in both vertical directions . in the initial state , the half of cylinder with the vertical coordinates @xmath19",
    "is occupied by particles .",
    "new particles arrive from a source at @xmath20 .",
    "the motion of each particle is a random walk on the occupied region finishing in the first unoccupied site .",
    "when @xmath2 particles are added , the occupied region reaches average level @xmath21 .",
    "the authors proved that the maximum deviation of the boundary of the occupied region from the average level is confined in a band of width @xmath22 with probability tending to 1 when @xmath23 .",
    "we consider a rotor - router version of the internal dla for the cylinder with slightly different boundary conditions . instead of the infinite cylinder",
    ", we consider a semi - infinite cylinder with @xmath24 .",
    "all @xmath25 boundary sites at the level @xmath26 are connected with a single site @xmath27 by the edges directed from @xmath27 to the boundary .",
    "four edges emanated from each bulk site and three edges from each boundary site are ordered cyclically , and @xmath25 edges from @xmath27 are equipped by an arbitrary cyclic order .",
    "particles one by one start at @xmath27 , jump to one of the @xmath25 bottom sites and perform the rotor - router walk on the set of previously occupied sites until reaching a first empty site .",
    "then a new particle is added to vertex @xmath27 which sends it along the next edge in the fixed permutation of @xmath25 edges directed to the boundary .",
    "the replacement of the random walk by the rotor - router one gives a drastic smoothing of the upper boundary of the region @xmath5 occupied by @xmath2 particles .",
    "we will show that for each @xmath28 the boundary is a perfect ring i.e. the section of the cylinder by a horizontal plane at the level @xmath21 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath30 particles occupy @xmath31 sites on the level @xmath32 , where specific positions of @xmath30 sites depend on the random initial orientations of rotors on the cylinder .",
    "thus , the width of the random boundary for @xmath33 is exactly 1 .",
    "the perfect boundary of @xmath5 for particular values of @xmath2 is not the first example of vanishing fluctuations in the aggregation models .",
    "kager and levine @xcite proposed a model of rotor - router aggregation on the square lattice obtained from @xmath34 by reflecting all directed edges on the @xmath35-and @xmath36-axes that point to a vertex closer to the origin .",
    "they proved that there exists a rotor configuration @xmath37 such that the occupied domain @xmath5 for @xmath38 and integer @xmath30 is exactly the diamond i.e. the set @xmath39 .",
    "the difference of our model from the example in @xcite is that the model considered below gives the perfect boundaries for an arbitrary initial configuration of rotors @xmath37 and there is no layered structure of rotor configurations in the domain @xmath5 .    in section 2 ,",
    "we define the model of rotor - router aggregation on the semi - infinite cylinder and prove the main result . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider the structure of recurrent states , first for the unicycles and then for arbitrary configurations of rotors on finite sublattices of the semi - infinite cylinder .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion .",
    "consider a part of the square lattice @xmath40 whose vertices are denoted by the pair of integers @xmath41 , @xmath42 with @xmath24 and neighboring vertices are connected by directed edges .",
    "the graph @xmath43 is periodic in the horizontal direction , so that vertices @xmath44 and @xmath45 are neighbors for all @xmath36 .",
    "we add to @xmath43 an extra vertex @xmath27 and connect it with boundary vertices @xmath46 by edges directed from @xmath27 to the boundary .",
    "to define the the rotor - router dynamics , we fix the clockwise ordering of edges n , e , s , w directed from bulk vertices @xmath41 , @xmath47 , the ordering w , n , s of the edges directed from boundary vertices and an arbitrary ordering of @xmath25 edges from vertex @xmath27 to boundary vertices @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the permutation of @xmath25 elements @xmath50 .",
    "a state @xmath51 of the model is characterized by the position @xmath52 of the particle called usually _ chip _ and a configuration of rotors @xmath53 at all vertices @xmath54 .",
    "each step of the rotor - router walk consists of updating the rotor configuration @xmath55 and moving the chip from @xmath56 to the nearest neighbor of @xmath56 in direction @xmath57 . the operation",
    "@xmath55 is the rotation of the rotor at @xmath56 to the next edge in the fixed order of edges emanating from @xmath56 .",
    "the initial state of the model is the empty set of occupied vertices @xmath58 and an arbitrary configuration of rotors @xmath37 at bulk vertices .",
    "the rotors at boundary vertices can be directed randomly to w , n or e , and the single rotor at vertex @xmath27 is directed to one of the boundary vertices chosen randomly .",
    "the initial position of a chip is vertex @xmath27 .",
    "the aggregation process consists of an unrestricted sequence of rotor - router walks starting at @xmath27 and finishing at the first vertex @xmath59 not visited before .",
    "the aggregation cluster @xmath60 becomes @xmath61 after the @xmath62-th walk .",
    "it is convenient to divide the whole sequence of walks into _ periods _ consisting of @xmath25 walks and investigate configurations of aggregated particles after each period .",
    "the result of the first period is trivial since each of boundary vertices @xmath63 , @xmath64 receives one particle from @xmath27 directly .",
    "the result of the next period is also simple because the vertices of the second row @xmath65 receive also one particle each during the second period .",
    "this follows from the fact that none of the edges connecting the vertices of the first and the second row can conduct more than one particle during the second period .",
    "indeed , assume that the boundary vertex @xmath66 is the first vertex of the first row which transfers two particles to the vertex @xmath67 .",
    "the rotor at @xmath68 should make for this more than three rotations , for instance w@xmath69 n , n@xmath69 e , e@xmath69 w , w@xmath69 n. since each rotation at a vertex @xmath70 follows a particle hit into @xmath70 , the vertex @xmath68 should receive al least four particles from its neighbors .",
    "one particle goes from @xmath27 , but vertices @xmath71 and @xmath72 can deliver not more than one particle each since the vertex @xmath68 is the first vertex performing more than three rotations by the assumption .",
    "we come to a contradiction and , therefore , @xmath25 particles emanated from @xmath27 during the second period are distributed uniformly among vertices of the second row .",
    "we obtained the perfect boundary of the aggregation cluster @xmath5 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 . to prove the same for any @xmath28",
    ", we need an induction on the number of periods with the following induction hypothesis .    _",
    "induction hypothesis_. let @xmath75 be a part of graph @xmath43 consisting of @xmath76 rows @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "assume that there exists the aggregation cluster @xmath5 with @xmath79 obtained after @xmath76 periods and coinciding with @xmath80 .",
    "then , the @xmath81-th period results in the uniform distribution of @xmath25 particles among the vertices of the @xmath81-th row .    _ proof_. chips come in @xmath80 from @xmath27 one by one and walk from the first row to the @xmath76-th row where they leave @xmath80 along one of the edges connecting the @xmath76-th and @xmath81-th rows .",
    "assume that two chips used the same edge @xmath82 connecting vertices @xmath83 and @xmath84 during one period .",
    "let @xmath85 be a moment of time within the @xmath81-th period when the second chip passes @xmath82 .",
    "this implies one of two possibilities .",
    "( a)there is a moment of time @xmath86 of the @xmath81-th period when one of the rotors of the @xmath76-the row , say the rotor at @xmath83 , performs @xmath87 rotations for the first time .",
    "five rotations need five hits of the walk into @xmath83 . since the rotors at @xmath88,@xmath89 performed less than 5 rotations to the moment @xmath90 , the vertex @xmath83",
    "is visited from its neighbors @xmath91 and @xmath92 not more than once from each side .",
    "therefore , it was visited to the moment @xmath90 not less than @xmath93 times from @xmath94 .",
    "\\(b ) vertex @xmath83 is visited from @xmath94 less than 3 times to the moment @xmath90 .",
    "then , it should be visited from its neighbors @xmath91 and @xmath92 more than twice to perform five rotations .",
    "one of the vertices @xmath91 and @xmath92 or both should be visited to this end not less than five times taking additional hits either from next neighbors in the @xmath76-th row or from the @xmath95-th row .",
    "since the number of vertices in the row is restricted , there is a vertex @xmath96 which is visited @xmath93 times from @xmath97 for the first time before @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , there exist a moment of time @xmath98 , @xmath99 , within the @xmath81-th period and a vertex @xmath100 , @xmath101 of the @xmath95-th row where the rotor sends the chip to the @xmath76-th row exactly @xmath93 times for the first time .",
    "consider now rotors in the @xmath95-th row at vertices @xmath102 . if one of these rotors sends the chip to the @xmath76-th row three times during the @xmath81-th period ,",
    "there are two possibilities again .",
    "\\(a ) there is a moment of time @xmath103 when the rotor at a vertex @xmath94,@xmath104 performs @xmath105 rotations for the first time . since the rotors at @xmath97,@xmath89 performed less than 9 rotations to the moment @xmath106 , the vertex @xmath94",
    "is visited from its neighbors @xmath107 and @xmath108 not more than two times from each side . by condition , vertex @xmath83 performs less than 5 rotations to the moment @xmath106 .",
    "so , it sends not more than one chip towards @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , vertex @xmath94 is visited to the moment @xmath106 not less than @xmath109 times from @xmath110 to provide total 9 visits .",
    "\\(b ) vertex @xmath94 is visited from @xmath110 less than 4 times and not more than once from @xmath83 .",
    "then , it must take additional visits from one of the rotors at @xmath111 in the @xmath95-th row .",
    "at least one of these rotors has to perform 9 rotations before @xmath106 and there exists a rotor which takes @xmath109 visits from the row @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , there exists a moment of time @xmath113 , within the @xmath81-th period and a vertex @xmath114 , @xmath101 of the @xmath112-th row where the rotor sends the chip to the @xmath95-th row exactly @xmath109 times for the first time .",
    "continuing the reasoning row by row , we come to a conclusion that one of the rotors of the @xmath115-th row at vertices @xmath116 must perform @xmath117 rotations .",
    "if it happens at the moment @xmath118 , there exists a moment @xmath119 and a vertex @xmath120 , @xmath101 where the rotor sends the chip to the @xmath115-th row exactly @xmath121 times for the first time and performs not less than @xmath122 rotations .",
    "now we put @xmath123 and consider the first row of rotors at vertices @xmath124 .",
    "it follows from the above that at least one of these rotors should be directed to the second row @xmath125 times.the rotors at boundary of the cylinder have three allowed directions w , n , s so that a full rotation consists of 3 steps .",
    "the minimal number of rotations needed to send chips @xmath125 times to the second row is @xmath126 .",
    "if the rotor at vertex @xmath127 , rotates the @xmath128-th time at the moment @xmath129 for the first time , it implies that this vertex took @xmath130 visits from neighboring vertices .",
    "two vertices @xmath131 and @xmath132 can provide @xmath133 with no more than @xmath76 visits each to moment @xmath129 , and vertex @xmath134 not more than @xmath135 visits , altogether @xmath136 visits . therefore , the vertex @xmath27 should send to @xmath133 not less than 2 chips what contradicts the condition that @xmath27 distributes during one period exactly @xmath25 chips among all @xmath25 outgoing edges .",
    "thus , the induction hypothesis is proved and we obtain the perfect boundary of the aggregation cluster @xmath5 for any @xmath28 .",
    "if the number of rotor - router walks starting from vertex @xmath27 has the form @xmath29 , the aggregation cluster consists of @xmath137 rows of vertices completely occupied by particles , and the remaining @xmath30 particles are arranged in the @xmath138-row at @xmath30 vertices whose positions depend on a random configuration of rotors @xmath53 on the occupied part of the semi - infinite cylinder .",

    "we put a single chip to vertex @xmath27 and consider the path traced by the chip performing the rotor walk until the moment when the chip has used all @xmath25 outgoing edges of @xmath27 and returned to @xmath27 . by construction ,",
    "the closed path on @xmath140 is equivalent to @xmath25 paths traced by @xmath25 particles starting at @xmath27 during the @xmath81-th period . in the original cylinder formulation ,",

    "a question arises what is the number of passages of each edge in the path . a key role in answering this question",
    "is played by the notion of _ unicycle _ which is defined in @xcite as the chip - and - rotor state @xmath51 where a configuration of rotors @xmath53 contains a unique directed cycle and vertex @xmath56 lies on this cycle . in the case of eulerian graphs , where the indegree of each vertex equals its outdegree",

    "since the positions of chips on cycles are arbitrary , we chose for definiteness @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "the components of vector @xmath180 are @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "the first @xmath147-eulerian tour starting in vertex @xmath27 and returning to @xmath27 after 62 steps is denoted in the left part of fig.[multi ] by the full lines .",
    "the second @xmath147-eulerian tour starting in vertex 2 and returning to 2 consists of 4 steps and is denoted by the dotted lines .",
    "two tours together generate the standard ring configuration and contain @xmath209 steps .",
    "one can notice that the rings around the vertices of the top row are not completed after the first tour .",
    "nevertheless , the completed segments of these rings reach the edges directed to @xmath141 in accordance with the results of section ii . indeed",
    ", the first tour coincides with the closed path on @xmath140 traced by the chip starting from @xmath27 with the rotor configuration @xmath37 . on the other hand , it is equivalent to @xmath25 paths traced by @xmath25 particles starting at @xmath27 during the @xmath81-th period . but according to section ii , all @xmath25 particles pass the edges directed upwards from the vertices of the top row exactly once .    the right part of fig.[multi ]",
    "represents the case when the first @xmath147-eulerian tour starts from the vertex 2 .",
    "again , the segments of the first tour are denoted by the full lines .",
    "the number of steps in the first tour is 58 .",
    "the second tour started from @xmath27 is denoted by dotted lines and consists of 8 steps , which complete the first tour to the standard ring configuration .",
    "for the general graph @xmath140 , the construction of multicycle @xmath183 allows one to determine an upper bound for the length of the single closed path during the @xmath81-th period .",
    "this closed path is traced by the first of @xmath184 chips placed to @xmath203 in the initial chip - and - rotor state corresponding to the beginning of the @xmath81-th period .",
    "the other @xmath210 chips at @xmath211 generate auxiliary paths that show how far the first path is from completing the standard ring configuration .",
    "each of these cycles takes at least two steps to return to its starting vertex @xmath212 since the minimal cycle is a dimer formed by two opposite rotors . taking into account that the total length of the @xmath147-eulerian tours of all chips is @xmath213 ,",
    "we conclude that the length of the closed path starting at @xmath27 is bounded by @xmath214 for the rotor configuration on @xmath140 containing @xmath184 cycles .",
    "besides the rotor - router dynamics , the perfect surface obtained in section ii is a consequence of two factors : the cylinder geometry and the orientation of the square lattice .",
    "the crucial property of the considered aggregation process is the independent occupation by particles of a new row of vertices during each period .",
    "this property vanishes for lattices of different symmetry , for instance , for the honeycomb lattice or for the square lattices turning 45 degrees from the cylinder generatrix . in fig.[turn ] , we show a part of cylinder taken out of a turned square lattice . as",

    "one of the particles stops , according to the aggregation rules and the second continues a motion in a randomly chosen direction preventing the formation of a perfect surface . then , the question about a constant width of boundary fluctuations remains open in this case .    at the same time , a proof of the constant width of the boundary for the square lattice having an arbitrary orientation on the cylinder would be an essential step towards the proof of the constant bonds for fluctuations of the circular form of the aggregation cluster on the two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "indeed , the formation of the boundary of a large circle in the intervals corresponding to four cardinal directions resembles the aggregation process on the cylinder orientated along the lattice axes .",
    "a turned square lattice reproduces fluctuations of the circular form in an arbitrary direction when the cluster radius tends to infinity .",
