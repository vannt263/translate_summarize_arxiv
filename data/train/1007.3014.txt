    "quasicrystals are alloys that show long range order but possess symmetries that prevent them from being crystals . from their spectacular experimental realization in the early 80 s @xcite to their very recent discovery as natural objects in the kamtchatka mountains @xcite , quasicrystals have been the subject of very active research , whose application and interest extend far beyond the scope of solid state physics .",
    "the first examples observed were rapidly quenched alloys of aluminum and manganese exhibiting icosahedral symmetry . in these quasicrystals ,",
    "atoms are known to appear with a given frequency .",
    "this means that for a large ball @xmath0 of radius @xmath1 , the ratio of the number @xmath2 of atoms inside @xmath0 corresponding to a specific atomic element @xmath3 ( for example aluminum in the first known cases ) to the total number @xmath4 of atoms in the ball @xmath0 tends to a limit @xmath5 as @xmath1 tends to infinity :    @xmath6    for such examples , the following questions arise naturally :    1 .   to estimate the oscillation of the ratio @xmath7 around its limit @xmath5 , that is to say , to give upper bounds for the speed of convergence to @xmath8 of the ratio @xmath9 as @xmath1 goes to infinity ; 2 .   to extend these estimates to domains whose closure are not euclidean balls .",
    "we now make these questions more concrete by using aperiodic tilings of the euclidean space to model quasicrystals ( see @xcite ) , for details and precise statements of the results , see section [ sec : definitions ] .",

    "for each @xmath17 , we let @xmath18 denote the number of isometric copies of @xmath14 in @xmath15 , @xmath19 the number of tiles of @xmath10 , and @xmath20 the number of tiles of @xmath10 that intersect @xmath16 . if @xmath15 is a ball , then it is well - known that there are tilings such that for each @xmath21 in @xmath22 , the ratio @xmath23 tends to a well - defined limit @xmath24 as the radius of @xmath15 tends to infinity ( see for instance @xcite ) .",

    "self - similar tilings , which are probably the most studied examples of aperiodic tilings ( see for instance @xcite and references therein , examples are given in section [ examples ] ) , are associated with a ( substitution ) primitive square matrix @xmath28 having non - negative integer elements . by perron - frobenius theory",

    "both triangles are equipped with decorations ( arrows ) on their edges as shown in figure [ fig : penrose ] .",

    "elements of @xmath342 are called penrose tilings .",

    ", using the estimates for the table substitution gives better estimates than the estimates for the square substitution .",
    "it is natural to wonder why ?",
    "the answer simply relies on the fact that the square substitution system is less efficient than the table one in the sense that the estimates of the error for the @xmath70th substitution of the square @xmath43 , which is a square of size @xmath379 , yields an error term of size @xmath380 .",
