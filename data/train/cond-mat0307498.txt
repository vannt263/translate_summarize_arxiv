    "the separation of time scales is a frequently met dynamical feature of physical , chemical and biological processes . in practically all cases the parameters characterizing a particular system are only constant on a limited time scale . on longer time scales",
    "they may change their values because the surrounding environment slowly changes its state .",
    "we just note that even the most fundamental `` constants '' of nature like e.g. the fine structure constant possibly undergo a very slow change in time @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", most natural processes also display very fast changes which usually will be disregarded in a phenomenological description .",
    "they only will show up in a microscopic description in which the effective degrees of freedom of the phenomenological model are represented as functions of microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "the time evolution of these microscopic degrees of freedom typically takes place on much faster time scales than those of the macroscopic observables whereas , as already mentioned , global aspects of the environment may undergo temporal variations that are much slower than the dynamics of the considered macroscopic system .",
    "it is this separation of time scales that allows one to describe a system in terms of a comparatively simple model that is closed in the sense that only a few macroscopic observables are subject to the dynamics . on the slow time scale",
    "the key technical notion here is that of a _ constraint equilibrium _ that is reached by the fast part of a system before the slow constituents change their values on the slower time scale .",
    "this constraint equilibrium then immediately adapts to the changes of the slow system .",
    "this approach has been applied in many branches of physics and other sciences and is vital for various methods like adiabatic elimination , averaging , synergetics , subdynamics , chemical kinetics and hierarchical computational schemes @xcite . in the present paper we consider markovian processes the dynamics of which",
    "can be subdivided into a fast and a slow component .",
    "in particular , we have in mind the case where the slow motion is caused by transitions between metastable states @xcite .",
    "the relaxation toward these states constitutes the fast part of the dynamics .",
    "additionally , some of the system s parameters may undergo slow variations in time that may be caused by a slow drift , or fluctuations of the parameters , or by an external driving of the system .",
    "the dynamics of the considered system then has two slow components : the transitions and the driving . about their relation",
    "we do not make further assumptions : the slow intrinsic dynamics can be faster or slower than the external driving that must only be slow compared to the fast dynamics of the system . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have called this type of situation the semiadiabatic limit , in contrast to the adiabatic limit in which the driving is slow compared to the total intrinsic dynamics including that of the transitions . clearly , the adiabatic limit is contained in the semiadiabatic limit as a special case .",
    "stochastic resonance is just one example for which the semiadiabatic limit is of relevance when the period of the signal is large @xcite",
    ". ratchets , or brownian motors , provide another class of systems which also operate in the semiadiabatic regime @xcite .",
    "atomic force microscopes and optical tweezers often act on time scales that are slow compared to the vibrational and other intrinsic time - scales of the molecules that are manipulated by them @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ ii ] the reduction of a fokker - planck process with multiple mestastable states to a master equation is reviewed as it was developed in refs .",
    "this method is generalized to processes with slowly time dependent parameters in sect .",
    "the time rate of change of the probability now consists of two contributions .",
    "one is given by the rate as it would result if the parameters of the process were frozen and the other contribution mainly takes into account the changes of the geometry of the domains of attraction of the metastable states .",
    "this geometric contribution is proportional to the time rate of change of the parameters and therefore is negligible compared to the frozen rates if the time dependent parameters change sufficiently slowly .",
    "in contrast to previous investigations , @xcite we find that the fastest time dependence of the parameters for which one may neglect the geometric contributions is not only determined by the deterministic time scales of the process but in general also depends on the strength of the noise .",
    "the way how the noise here enters depends on the particular process .",
    "the present investigation is complementary to previous work that is restricted to periodic driving with an intermediate regime of external driving frequencies @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ iv ] we assume the validity of the master equation with frozen rates and determine a time dependent decoration of the discrete states such that the dynamics of the continuous variables of the underlying fokker - planck process are recovered on the long time scale .",
    "the archetypical example for stochastic resonance namely that of a periodically damped bistable brownian oscillator is discussed in sect .",
    "[ v ] and the validity of the mcnamara - wiesenfeld model of stochastic resonance @xcite is discussed .",
    "the paper ends with a summary in sect .",
    "in this section we review the reduction of a fokker - planck equation describing a _ time - homogeneous _ process with multiple metastable states to a master equation that gives the dynamics on the time scales of the transitions between the metastable states . for this purpose we consider a dynamical system under the influence of weak random forces and assume that these forces can be modeled by gaussian white noise",
    ". then the stochastic dynamics is described by a fokker - planck equation @xcite : ( , t ) = l ( , t ) where @xmath0 denotes the fokker - planck operator : l = -_i k_i ( ) + _ i , j d_ij ( ) here , @xmath1 denotes a point with coordinates @xmath2 in the @xmath3-dimensional state space @xmath4 ; further , @xmath5 is the drift vector and @xmath6 the diffusion matrix resulting from the random forces .",
    "we further restrict ourselves to systems with a uniquely defined stationary probability density @xmath7 with respect to which detailed balance holds .",
    "consequently , the fokker - planck operator satisfies the relation @xcite : l _ 0 = _ 0 ^+ . where @xmath8 is the backward , or adjoint fokker - planck operator :",
    "l^+ = k_i ( ) + d_i , j ( ) . the tilde denotes the operation of time reversal , i.e. @xmath9 with parity @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the multiplication operator with the probability density , i.e. @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an arbitrary state space function .    in the deterministic limit",
    "the diffusion matrix goes to zero and the drift vector approaches the deterministic vector field @xmath14 governing the deterministic motion of the system : ( t ) = ^(0)((t ) ) in the presence of weak random perturbations @xmath15 may differ from @xmath16 by small noise induced contributions .",
    "we here are interested in cases where the deterministic system ( [ dem ] ) has a number @xmath17 of coexisting attractors labeled by @xmath18 .",
    "to each attractor @xmath18 there belongs a domain of attraction @xmath19 .",
    "the domains are disjoint and partition the total available state space : _ _  & = & + _ = 1^m d _ & = &      in the above shown potential induces a partitioning of the state space @xmath20 into the domains of attraction @xmath21 of the three attractors @xmath22 at the potential minima . here",
    "the locations of the local potential maxima coincide with the boundaries between the domains of attraction.,width=377 ]    for weak noise the stationary probability density is almost zero everywhere except close to the attractors .",
    "if the noise vanishes the stationary density shrinks to dirac @xmath23-functions sitting at the attractors of the deterministic system .",
    "because no transitions between the different attractors may occur in the noiseless case , each of the delta functions is a stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation @xmath24 belonging to a @xmath17-fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath25 .",
    "the degeneracy also follows from the backward equation which is governed by the adjoint fokker - planck operator @xmath8 defined in eq .",
    "( [ bfp ] ) . in the deterministic case",
    "the diffusion matrix vanishes , so the second derivatives disappear and the stationary solutions of the backward operator are constant along the trajectories of the deterministic system . because within a domain of attraction all trajectories approach the same attractor the stationary solutions of the noiseless backward equation are constant on the domain of attraction @xmath19 .",
    "one then can choose the characteristic functions @xmath26 of the domains of attraction as @xmath17 independent solutions of the stationary deterministic backward equation @xmath27 : c^(0 ) _",
    "( ) = \\ {    ll 1 & _ + 0 &    . in the presence of weak noise",
    "these functions can be modified slightly such that they still solve the stationary backward equation up to corrections that are exponentially small in the noise strength : the step - like discontinuities then are smeared out on layers located at the boundaries of the domains of attraction @xmath19 .",
    "the functions can be constructed by means of the method of matched asymptotic expansions @xcite , see also refs .",
    "outside the boundary layers no modification is required and hence they retain their property of localizing the different domains of attraction . in the following , these localizing functions will be denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "we summarize their main properties : they solve @xmath29 up to exponentially small corrections in the noise strength , have the values one within and zero outside @xmath19 and interpolate between these values smoothly on a thin boundary layer @xcite . as solutions of these particular boundary value problems , the functions @xmath28 are the _ splitting probabilities _ that give the relative frequencies with which a trajectory starting at @xmath30 first reaches the attractor @xmath18 before it visits any other attractor @xcite .    the splitting probabilities in general are not eigenfunctions of the backward operator .",
    "however , they span the subspace of eigenfunctions that emerges from the eigenspace of the @xmath17-fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath25 of the deterministic dynamics if weak noise perturbes the system and lifts the degeneracy .",
    "the resulting finite eigenvalues are still small compared to all other finite eigenvalues .",
    "hence , this subspace describes the slow dynamics of the system at weak noise .",
    "in particular , it contains the constant function which is the exact eigenfunction of the backward equation belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath25 . at weak noise",
    "this eigenfunction can be represented as the sum over the characteristic functions @xmath28 : _ _ ( ) = 1 .",
    "because of detailed balance , the slow subspace of the forward operator is spanned by the basis set @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the image of @xmath33 under time reversal .",
    "hence , the probability density describing the slow dynamics can be represented as : ( , t ) = _",

    "( ) _ 0 ( )    as already noted the characteristic functions @xmath28 and , therefore also their time reversed partners @xmath34 , are well localized functions as long as the noise does not become too large .",
    "as a consequence , one may use the functions @xmath28 in order to determine the probability @xmath35 that the system resides in the domain of attraction of the attractor @xmath18 @xcite : p_(t ) = ( _ , ( t ) ) where the scalar product is defined as the integral of the product of its arguments over the state space : ( f , g ) = i_d^nf ( ) g ( ) . if we assume that the probability density @xmath36 is of the form ( [ sr ] ) we obtain p_(t ) = c_(t ) n _ where we have made use of the localization of the characteristic functions at weak noise : ( _ , _  _ 0 ) = _ , ",
    "n _ and have introduced the function @xmath37 giving the population of the metastable state @xmath18 in the equilibrium distribution @xmath38 .",
    "the time evolution of the probabilities @xmath35 now follows from the projection of the fokker - planck equation ( [ fp ] ) onto the slow subspace , i.e. we assume the probability density to take the form ( [ sr ] ) and determine the scalar product with @xmath28 on both sides of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "this yields p_(t ) = _  p_(t ) under the sum on the right hand side we expressed the coefficients @xmath39 by means of eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) in terms of the probabilities @xmath40 leading to the equilibrium weights @xmath41 in the denominator of the respective coefficient . for @xmath42",
    "the coefficient @xmath43 coincides with the rayleigh - quotient expressions for the rate from @xmath44 to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the integral is dominated by a neighborhood of the saddle point that connects the domains of attraction @xmath45 and @xmath21 @xcite . within this neighborhood , for small noise",
    ", the localizing function @xmath28 can be approximated by the characteristic function of @xmath46 , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the resulting coefficient then coincides with the better known flux - over - population expression for the respective rate @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can show that for sufficiently weak noise the expression @xmath48 is positive for @xmath42 . from eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) it follows that the sum of the coefficients over @xmath18 vanishes .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ pme ] ) has the proper form of a master equation : p_(t ) = _ ",
    "r_, p_(t ) - _  r_ , p_(t ) where r_, = is the transition probability per unit time from @xmath44 to @xmath18 .",
    "the regime of validity of this approximation , of course , depends on the particular system and the degree of accuracy one would like to achieve . by its very nature this master equation is only appropriate for the long time dynamics of the fokker - planck equation and therefore requires a clear separation of time scales dividing the process into fast relaxations within the domains of attraction and slow transitions between the attractors .",
    "we note that various definitions of transition rates exist which are different from a physical point of view but which still yield the same result if a master equation provides a correct description of the long time dynamics .",
    "it turns out that the actual differences between these rate expressions are exponentially small in the noise strength , i.e. of the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a relevant barrier hight and @xmath51 the noise strength .",
    "so if we are ready to accept an error of , say @xmath52 , all barriers in the system must be higher than approximately @xmath53 .",
    "after these preparatory considerations we turn to our main topic and consider a fokker - planck process of the kind of the previous section with the only difference that we now allow for slow changes of the parameters of the system . these could result from a slow drift of the environmental parameters of the system like e.g. the temperature , a slow increase of an external field , or a slow periodic force driving the system , to name but a few realizations .",
    "we emphasize that the change of the parameters must be slow compared to the fast relaxation within each domain of attraction but no assumption is made how it compares to the slow intrinsic dynamics of the system describing the transitions between different domains of attraction .",
    "we assume that in the presence of these time dependent parameters one still can identify domains of attraction which do not merge or split as time changes but retain their identity . in other words , we restrict ourselves to changes of the parameters that do not lead to topological changes of the system .",
    "the resulting process is still markovian and is governed by a fokker - planck equation : ( t ) = l(t ) ( t ) where the fokker - planck operator @xmath54 is of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ fpo ] ) with time dependent drift @xmath55 and possibly also a time dependent diffusion matrix @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , we assume that all parameter values which the system experiences in the course of time correspond to equilibrium systems , i.e. that for any frozen parameter value the system will reach an equilibrium distribution relative to which the system obeys detailed balance : l(t ) _ 0(t ) = _ 0(t ) ^+(t ) where the tilde denotes time reversal and @xmath57 is the multiplication operator with the equilibrium distribution @xmath58 that would be attained if the parameter values were frozen at the values that they assume at time @xmath59 : l(t ) _ 0(,t ) = 0 .",
    "for vanishing noise the system will move toward the nearest attractor as defined by the momentary values of the parameters . during this relaxation time , the parameters of the system are supposed to change by such a small amount that they can be considered as kept constant . only when the system has reached the attractor and stays there for a much longer time",
    ", the change of parameters will become noticeable and the system will follow the slow motion of the attractor as it results from the changing parameters .",
    "this means that the time rate of change of the deterministic drift is characterized by a small parameter @xmath60 : _",
    "r= o ( ) where @xmath61 is a typical relaxation time of the deterministic motion . under this very condition",
    "many of the properties of the time homogeneous process carry over to the case with time dependent parameters .    to each attractor",
    "@xmath18 then there belongs a domain of attraction @xmath62 together with its characteristic function @xmath63 which is @xmath64 on @xmath62 and @xmath25 elsewhere in @xmath4 .",

    "the proportionality factor @xmath135 increases as a function of the inverse temperature first as a power law and changes to an exponential growth for large values of @xmath128 , see fig  [ f3 ] .",
    "is shown for the driving strength @xmath136 .",
    "the straight line corresponds to a barrier height @xmath137.,width=302 ]    we propose the following physical explanation of this effect : at large @xmath138 the noise is very small such that a particle that has reached at some time the top of the barrier has a very small chance to be pushed to either side by the noise . during the same time when it resides there , the potential moves such that the particle no longer will sit on top of the barrier .",
    "depending on the direction of the motion of the potential the particle may now be on the opposite side of the barrier or on the original side where it came from . in the former case the geometric correction leads to an increase of the rate and in the latter case to a decrease of the transition rate . because it then has again to overcome a barrier the increase of the rate is exponentially large in the inverse temperature .",
    "finally we note that the deviation from the frozen rate on the noise strength depends on the particular model .",
    "for example in symmetric systems with varying barrier height the deviation only grows with the square root of the inverse temperature rather than exponential as in the above case where both the location and the height of the barrier changes in time .",
    "we have projected the dynamics of a a process with multiple metastable states and slowly time dependent parameters onto the slow subspace defined by the eigenfunctions of fokker - planck operator     and driving frequency @xmath139 strongly depends on the magnitude of the noise .",
    "for @xmath140 the noise is relatively large such that the average position closely follows its adiabatic value and therefore shows almost no hysteresis ; for @xmath141 it stays behind the force , and for @xmath142 it is hardly influenced by the force .",
    "the hysteresis curves are traced in the mathematically positive sense.,width=377 ]    as a simple example of the decoration of the two metastable states we come back to the bistable oscillator and consider the asymptotic motion of its average position . from eq .",
    "( [ fa ] ) it results as x(t ) = x(t)|1 p_1(t ) + x(t)|2 p_2(t ) where @xmath143 denotes the conditional average of the position in the well corresponding to the metastable state @xmath18 : x(t)| & = & idx x _ 0(x",
    ", t ) + & & x_(t ) in the last equation we disregarded small contributions of the order @xmath144 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath35 follow as the asymptotic solutions of the master equation : p_1(t ) & = & e^-k(t ) + i_0^t ds e^-(k(t ) -k(s ) ) r_1,2(s ) + p_2(t ) & = & 1 - p_2(t ) where k(t ) = i_0^t ds ( r_1,2(t ) + r_2,1(t ) )    rather than considering the time dependence we here show in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] the dependence of the position on the driving force @xmath145 . in general the position lacks behind the force and therefore the dependence is hysteretic . only if the driving is either very slow or very fast compared to the average rates there is no hysteretic behavior . in the slow case",
    "many transitions occur before a change of the potential becomes sensible .",
    "the asymptotic probabilities @xmath35 take the form of the stationary probabilities for the frozen rates .",
    "they then depend on the force but not on its rate of change . in the opposite limit",
    "the asymptotic probabilities see only the average rates and hence are time independent .",
    "in this paper we studied the dynamics of externally driven systems with multiple metastable states in the semiadiabatic limit .",
    "the full dynamics of the system comprising the fast and the slow time scales of the intrawell relaxations and of the external driving as well as of the transitions between the metastable states , respectively , is supposed to be markovian and continuous and , hence , described by a fokker - planck equation .",
    "we showed that the long time dynamics of this fokker - planck equation is equivalent to the dynamics of the master equation for the transitions between the discrete metastable states .",
    "the rates that determine this master equation are time dependent taking values as if the parameters were frozen at their instantaneous values .",
    "this kind of kinetic description is not new and has long been used in the literature @xcite .",
    "the present work , however , provides three new aspects .",
    "first the master equation does not result from an educated guess .",
    "it rather is obtained as the result of the projection of the dynamics onto the slow subspace of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "this systematic approach additionally gives a quantitative criterion when deviations from the master equation with frozen rates must be expected .",
    "this criterion does explicitly take into account the time change of the parameters and in contrast to other works @xcite is not based on a comparison of time scales of the frozen dynamics with the rate of change of the parameters . as a particular result we found for the dynamics of a periodically driven overdamped brownian oscillator that the maximal driving frequency depends on the noise strength and decreases with decreasing noise strength .",
    "asymptotically this dependence even is exponential .",
    "future work still has to show whether one can achieve an improvement of the dynamics if the so called geometric corrections to the rates are taken into account in cases when the time scale separation between the fast intrawell relaxation and the changes of the parameters becomes less pronounced .",
    "the third main outcome of the present approach is a partial retrieval of the underlying dynamics of the continuous variables by means of a proper decoration of the discrete states with time dependent random variables .",
    "the necessary time scale separation forced us to exclude the occurrence of bifurcations of the deterministic dynamics caused by the change of the parameters .",
    "such bifurcations are accompanied by a slowing down of the deterministic dynamics and at the same time by a lowering of a barrier height and consequently by a decreasing time scale of transitions .",
    "hence , for time dependent parameters , the time scale separation between interwell and intrawell dynamics is violated within a time window around the instant of bifurcation .",
    "it seems plausible that it should be possible to cut out this time window and to bridge it by some connection condition for the probabilities of those states that are involved in the bifurcation .",
    "apart from the separation of the time scales , another assumption was made in the present work .",
    "first , we assumed that for fixed values of the parameters the system reaches a state of thermal equilibrium and hence it obeys detailed balance .",
    "we think that this assumption is not really essential for our results but it simplifies the analysis considerably . without detailed balance more general limit sets of the dynamics can occur apart from limit points such as limit cycles and chaotic states . in general , the stationary densities",
    "are not known in absence of detailed balance , the weak noise asymptotics is plagued by notorious nonanalyticities @xcite , and rather little is known about transition rates in nonequilibrium systems . on the other hand",
    "there are many important systems that are driven out of equilibrium by time dependent parameters .",
    "the authors thank igor goychuk , peter hnggi , sigmund kohler , marcin kostur and michael schindler for valuable discussions and hints .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( sfb438 ) .",
    "for a sufficiently long time lag @xmath85 the conditional probability @xmath146 of the continuous process @xmath147 can be expressed in terms of the basis functions @xmath148 and @xmath149 spanning the slow subspaces of the backward operator at time @xmath59 and the forward operator at time @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "one therefore can write : ( x , t+|y , t ) = _ ,  d(,;t , ) ( x , t+| ) _",
    "(y , t ) where we expressed the basis function @xmath149 by @xmath150 , see eq .",
    "( [ rxtae ] ) and introduced the yet undetermined coefficients @xmath151 into which the time dependent factor @xmath121 is absorbed .",
