    "<S> consider a scattering between two interacting particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath7 is much lighter ( @xmath9 ) yet much faster than the other ( @xmath10 ) but nevertheless @xmath11 . </S>",

    "<S> for the sake of concreteness take the potential to be attractive for now . in a typical scattering </S>",
    "<S> both masses are initially moving . </S>",
    "<S> the questions we are interested in investigating are : what _ statistically _ invariant features are shared by such scatterings in central force fields ? would many such small angle scatterings have a net effect on the energy of @xmath7 ?    while there is an active frontier of numerical work on many - body simulations @xcite , there are still interesting statistical inferences that can be derived from close analysis of two - body collisions . </S>",
    "<S> further , such inferences in the cases where the collisions are head on have been extensively studied as in the fermi acceleration mechanism@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast the main contribution to the effect presented in this paper is from collisions that are transverse ; i.e. , the trajectory of the massive particle , roughly speaking , is perpendicular to that of the small particle .    </S>",
    "<S> the organization is as following : 1 ) we give a heuristic description of the effect , 2 ) we provide a numerical verification 3 ) we prove the result by giving a mathematical derivation , 4 ) lastly we discuss this effect in a larger statistical context and discuss its difference from the equilibration process .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider two extreme cases that would convey the gist of what underlies this work . </S>",
    "<S> in the first case the massive particle , @xmath8 , slowly and _ transversely _ veers away from the trajectory of @xmath7 that is speeding by . in the second case , @xmath8 slowly and _ transversely _ approaches the trajectory of @xmath7 ( see figure [ fig : general_scattering(a , b)]-a ) .    in the first case where @xmath8 is moving away </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath7 falls into the potential well of @xmath8 and so long as it is approaching the point of minimum distance it gains kinetic energy . after passing this point </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath7 starts climbing up the potential well and pays back the gained kinetic energy by restoring it into the potential energy of the two - body system . </S>",
    "<S> however , on the way out of the well it climbs a well that is effectively smaller than the one it fell into as @xmath8 is on average farther away from it . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the case that the big mass is moving _ transversely away _ from the particle , the small particle emerges with a _ gain _ in the kinetic energy i.e. @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the exact opposite effect holds in the second case , where @xmath8 is moving towards @xmath7 . in this case , @xmath7 enters the potential well set up by @xmath8 and , as in the previous case , gains kinetic energy so long as it is approaching the minimum distance between the two masses . </S>",
    "<S> however , on the way out of the well it faces a more demanding climb as @xmath8 is on average closer to it and the potential well is steeper and deeper than before . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the case that the big mass is _ transversely approaching _ the particle ( figure [ fig : nonlinearity ] ) , the small particle emerges with a _ loss _ in the kinetic energy i.e. @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> the point however is that the two cases are not symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> _ the decreasing of the magnitude of the force with distance breaks the symmetry between the two cases_. this is shown in figure [ fig : nonlinearity ] : in an attractive force field , @xmath7 has a greater loss ( in magnitude ) of energy when @xmath8 approaches it than a gain ( in magnitude ) when @xmath8 recedes away from it . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry , deduced from dynamical principles , has consequences for the statistical mechanics of @xmath7 that we will explore .    a plot of potentials of type @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 , originally sitting at @xmath15 , is the central force that @xmath7 scatters from . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath8 moves to the right ( approaches @xmath7 ) by @xmath16 , it will set up a potential that is @xmath17 deeper for @xmath7 to climb out of than the one it fell into , whereby @xmath7 loses @xmath17 of energy to the central force as the result of the scattering . </S>",
    "<S> whereas , when @xmath8 is moving to the left ( away from @xmath7 ) by the same amount , @xmath16 , its potential is @xmath18 shallower and consequently @xmath7 gains @xmath18 of energy . </S>",
    "<S> note that the nonlinear dependence of @xmath19 , on @xmath1 makes the magnitude of the energy transfer in the two cases asymmetric : @xmath20 . ]    in repulsive force fields , @xmath6 , the potential in figure [ fig : nonlinearity ] flips about the horizontal axis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the phenomenology is the exact opposite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the particle has a larger gain than loss .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have described a purely dynamical phenomena where @xmath8 collides softly and transversely with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly if a very fast small particle ( e.g. , an electron ) zips through a dilute soup of big masses ( e.g , massive ions or stars in a galaxy ) that randomly either approach it or move away from it in the manner described above , the small mass statistically loses ( gains ) energy to ( from ) the big masses when the force fields are attractive ( repulsive ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that a high speed particle with low energy can lose or gain energy by scattering from larger masses with higher energies is not new . in the gravity </S>",
    "<S> assist or the slingshot effect , a satellite can be carefully steered so that , by elastically scattering from a planet or a star that is moving along or opposite to the direction of its asymptotic motion ( @xmath21 ) , it acquires a boost in energy or brakes to save fuel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the intuition in gravity assist , as in this work , is that to boost the energy of the satellite we have to throw it behind the approaching planet and vice versa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> slingshot effect , however , is not a net statistical effect resulting from an underlying random process .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to examine a scenario where the large masses move in random directions .    </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : numerical - verification]_a numerical experiment- _ we simulate a process where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions for @xmath7 and initial position of @xmath8 are taken to be the same in all the simulations ( see appendix [ sec : appendix :- numerical - details ] for the numerical details ) . to single out the effect of the _ direction _ of the motion of the large mass on the statistical energetics of @xmath7 , we take the velocity of @xmath8 to be : @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is kept constant , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is uniformly distributed on a circle @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath7 on average loses energy to @xmath8 ( figure [ fig : numerics ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to look at the points corresponding to the two extreme cases discussed in the previous section . when @xmath8 moves towards the trajectory of @xmath7 along the path of minimum approach ( @xmath31 ) , maximum loss is seen ; furthermore , when @xmath8 veers away from the path of minimum distance ( @xmath32 ) , the maximum gain is seen . </S>",
    "<S> both are congruent with our expectations . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : numerics ] , the @xmath29-average of the change in the kinetic energy of @xmath7 is shown in red , which is seen to be less than the kinetic energy of @xmath7 when @xmath8 is pinned down ( i.e. @xmath33 for all times ) . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> used as a calibration here , the asymptotic kinetic energy of @xmath7 is conserved ( shown with a black line in figure [ fig : numerics ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the black line corresponds to the case that @xmath8 is pinned down and @xmath7 , considered alone , undergoes a conservative elastic scattering : @xmath34 the red line corresponds to the @xmath35average of the asymptotic change in the kinetic energy of @xmath7 , with @xmath8 moving in twenty different directions chosen uniformly on a circle . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> error bars on the energies are of @xmath37 ; see the appendix . ]    _ analytical derivation- _ we are considering an standard elastic collision between two particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath38 and @xmath39 be the velocities of the two bodies in the lab frame ; the velocities in the center of mass ( @xmath40 system denoted by the suffix @xmath41 ) are related to the velocities in the lab by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 . in the @xmath40 system </S>",
    "<S> the collision simply rotates the velocities , which remain opposite in direction and unchanged in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> if we denote by @xmath45 the unit vector in the direction of the velocity of @xmath7 after the collision , then the velocities of the two particles after the collision ( distinguished by primes ) are @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in order to obtain the final velocities in the lab frame , denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> , we add the velocity of the center of mass @xmath50 to @xmath51 and @xmath52 ,    @xmath53    no further information about the collision can be obtained from the laws of conservation of momentum and energy . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the unit vector @xmath45 depends on the particular law of interaction and positions during the collision . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the massive particles are far enough from one another that a sequence of two - body scatterings would be adequate to describe the process @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : delke ] as a function of @xmath29 , once again , we look at the two special cases discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> first consider an attractive force field . </S>",
    "<S> suppose @xmath60 lies on the line of the minimum distance as shown in figure [ fig : general_scattering(a , b)]a . </S>",
    "<S> clearly if @xmath8 recedes away from @xmath7 then @xmath60 points in the same direction as @xmath61 and the dot product on the right hand side of [ eq : delke ] evaluates to be positive , whereas if @xmath60 and @xmath61 point in opposite directions the right hand side is negative . in the case of repulsion </S>",
    "<S> the signs would be the opposite ( see figure [ fig : general_scattering(a , b)]b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> unbounded trajectory in a ) an attractive force field and b ) repulsive force field , title=\"fig:\"]unbounded trajectory in a ) an attractive force field and b ) repulsive force field , title=\"fig : \" ]    what we now show is that the two cases are not symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> that is the kinetic energy loss ( gain ) in the approaching case is larger than the gain ( loss ) in the receding case for an(a ) attractive ( repulsive ) potential . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that if we keep the setting the same but _ only _ change the direction of @xmath60 , both @xmath62 and @xmath61 will change . in the attractive case ( figure [ fig : general_scattering(a , b)]a ) , if @xmath8 moves towards @xmath7 the angle between the asymptotes , @xmath63 , is smaller than it would be if @xmath8 moved away </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath64 is larger in the approaching case . </S>",
    "<S> for very high speed encounters , @xmath65 , we can approximate @xmath62 to be the same in the two cases , therefore eq . [ eq : delke ] becomes :    @xmath66    we next consider the case where @xmath8 moves in _ </S>",
    "<S> random directions_. we do so by applying the above to the cases of gravitational and coulomb interactions , where the equations of motion are particularly simple to integrate @xcite and analytical results can be compared to the numerical experiments of the previous section . </S>",
    "<S> we first parametrize : @xmath67 which is equal to @xmath60 in the limit where @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the orbits of scatterings in @xmath68 ( here @xmath3 is taken to be positive ) are hyperbolas parametrized by @xcite : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 ( hence time ) varies from @xmath74 to @xmath75 and @xmath76 we are interested in the change in the kinetic energy of the smaller mass in the lab frame @xcite . since , @xmath77 ; we have for @xmath78 , which reads @xmath79 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 and @xmath81 corresponds to the approaching case . at first sight </S>",
    "<S> it seems like averaging over @xmath29 would yield zero but as mentioned above , the eccentricity @xmath82 , the semi - axis @xmath83 and consequently @xmath84 depend on the initial velocities as they are functions of the angular momentum and the energy in the center of mass frame .    </S>",
    "<S> we can rewrite the formula by noting that @xmath85 and @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> for small angle scatterings , @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the relative velocity before collision and is a function of the initial angle the two velocities make with one another . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the previous equation can be rewritten as    @xmath90    with @xmath91 being the impact parameter , which also depends on the initial angle between the velocity of the two masses . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of interaction for gravitational and coulomb attractions are @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> for the two cases discussed above we have for the approaching case : @xmath81 and @xmath94 . and for the receding case @xmath95 and @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that @xmath97 ; therefore we yet again arrive at the same conclusion .    in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theoretical - prediction ] we plot eq . [ eq : final ] as a function of @xmath29 and see that our theoretical treatment and numerical experiment figure [ fig : numerics ] agree .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretical prediction of a net loss of energy for attractive fields agrees with the numerical experiment . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath29 was shifted by @xmath98 to be comparable to the experiment shown in figure [ fig : numerics ] . as before @xmath99 corresponds to the approaching case and @xmath100 to the receding case . </S>",
    "<S> the small discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values of @xmath101 is due to the finite box size in the experiments . ]    </S>",
    "<S> a formal statistical treatment depends on the particular laws of interaction as well as the statistical distribution of the large masses . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath102 it remains to show that under the assumption of microscopic chaos in the direction of motion of the large masses , the effect holds for any generic choice of initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> equation [ eq : final ] can be written entirely in terms of initial conditions in the lab frame as ( see appendix [ sub : formulation - entirely_inlab ] )    @xmath103    where , @xmath104 and @xmath105 encode the dependence on the initial conditions . now let @xmath106 and @xmath107 denote the @xmath29- average , we have    @xmath108    where @xmath109 encodes the dependence on the choice of initial conditions . figure [ fig : fvsz ] establishes the existence of the effect irrespective of particular choices of initial conditions in the scattering process as long as the assumptions leading up to eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : final ] are intact .    </S>",
    "<S> one can use mechanics of similarity to calculate @xmath110 when the law of interaction is coulombic @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in attractive potentials the small particle starts from non - equilibrium initial conditions and through a series of scatterings it statistically loses energy till a final scattering where the energy in the center of mass is negative . there on the small particle would have a bounded orbit about that final scatterer . </S>",
