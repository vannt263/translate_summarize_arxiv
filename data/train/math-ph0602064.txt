    "this is the third and final part of a sequence of papers on the gaussian random matrix ensemble with external source @xmath10 defined on @xmath1 hermitian matrices , where @xmath2 is a diagonal matrix with two eigenvalues @xmath3 ( with @xmath11 ) of equal multiplicities ( so that , @xmath12 is even ) .",
    "this matrix ensemble was introduced by brzin and hikami @xcite as a simple model for a phase transition that is expected to exhibit universality properties .",
    "the phase transition can be seen from the behavior of the eigenvalues of @xmath5 in the large @xmath12 limit , since for @xmath7 , the eigenvalues accumulate on two intervals , while for @xmath8 , the eigenvalues accumulate on one interval .",
    "the limiting mean density of eigenvalues follows from earlier work of pastur @xcite .",
    "it is based on an analysis of the equation ( pastur equation ) @xmath13 which yields an algebraic function @xmath14 defined on a three - sheeted riemann surface .",
    "the restrictions of @xmath14 to the three sheets are denoted by @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "there are four real branch points if @xmath7 which determine two real intervals .",
    "the two intervals come together for @xmath4 , and for @xmath8 , there are two real branch points , and two purely imaginary branch points .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] depicts the structure of the riemann surface @xmath14 for @xmath17 , @xmath4 , and @xmath18 .    in all cases we have that the limiting mean eigenvalue density @xmath19 of the matrix @xmath5 from ( [ matrixmodel ] ) is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the limiting value of @xmath22 as @xmath23 with @xmath24 . for @xmath25",
    "the limiting mean eigenvalue density vanishes at @xmath26 and @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "we note that this behavior at the closing ( or opening ) of a gap is markedly different from the behavior that occurs in the usual unitary random matrix ensembles @xmath29 where a closing of the gap in the spectrum typically leads to a limiting mean eigenvalue density @xmath30 that satisfies @xmath31 as @xmath32 if the gap closes at @xmath33 . in that case",
    "the local eigenvalue correlations can be described in terms of @xmath34-functions associated with the painlev ii equation , see @xcite .",
    "the phase transition for the model ( [ matrixmodel ] ) is different , and it can not be realized in a unitary random matrix ensemble .      the nature of the phase transition at @xmath4 may also be seen from an equivalent model of non - intersecting brownian paths , see figure [ figpaths ] .",
    "consider @xmath12 independent one - dimensional brownian motions that are conditioned to start at time @xmath35 at the origin , end at time @xmath36 at @xmath37 , where half of the paths ends at @xmath38 and the other half at @xmath39 , and that are conditioned not to intersect at intermediate times @xmath40 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , at any intermediate time @xmath41 , the positions of the @xmath12 brownian motions , have the same distribution as the eigenvalues of a gaussian random matrix ensemble with external source ( up to trivial scaling ) . now ,",
    "as @xmath6 and under appropriate scaling of the variance of the brownian motions , the paths fill out a region in the @xmath42-plane .",
    "then for small time the paths are in one group , which at a certain critical time @xmath43 splits into two groups , where one group ends at @xmath44 and the other group at @xmath45 .",
    "the situations @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 correspond to @xmath49 , @xmath4 , and @xmath7 , respectively , in the gaussian random matrix model with external source .",
    "the boundary curve has a cusp singularity at the critical time as shown in figure [ figpaths ] .",
    "brzin and hikami @xcite showed , see also @xcite , that the eigenvalues of the random matrix ensemble ( [ matrixmodel ] ) are distributed according to a determinantal point process .",
    "there is a kernel @xmath50 so that the eigenvalues @xmath51 have the joint probability density @xmath52 and so that for each @xmath53 , the @xmath54-point correlation function @xmath55 takes determinantal form as well : @xmath56    in @xcite we pointed out that the kernel can be built out of multiple hermite polynomials @xcite in much the same way that the correlation kernel for unitary random matrix ensembles ( without external source ) is related to orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the christoffel - darboux formula for multiple orthogonal polynomials @xcite allows one to express the kernel in terms of the riemann - hilbert problem for multiple hermite polynomials ( see @xcite and below ) . applying the deift / zhou steepest descent analysis @xcite to the riemann - hilbert problem in the non - critical case",
    ", we were able to show that the kernel has the usual scaling limits from random matrix theory .",
    "that is , we obtain the sine kernel @xmath57 in the bulk , and the airy kernel @xmath58 at the edge of the spectrum , as scaling limits of @xmath50 if @xmath7 @xcite or @xmath8 @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we consider the double scaling limit at the critical parameter @xmath4 of the gaussian random matrix ensemble with external source , or equivalently , of the non - intersecting brownian motion model at the critical time @xmath47 .",
    "as is usual in a critical case , there is a family of limiting kernels that arise when @xmath59 changes with @xmath12 and @xmath60 as @xmath6 in a critical way .",
    "these kernels are constructed out of pearcey integrals and therefore they are called pearcey kernels .",
    "the pearcey kernels were first described by brzin and hikami @xcite . a detailed proof of the following result was recently given by tracy and widom @xcite .",
    "[ maintheo ] we have for every fixed @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the pearcey kernel @xmath64 with @xmath65 the contour @xmath66 consists of the four rays @xmath67 , with the orientation shown in figure [ fig : contoursigma ] .",
    "that appears in the definition of @xmath68.,width=188,height=188 ]    the functions ( [ pearceyintegrals ] ) are called pearcey integrals @xcite .",
    "they are solutions of the third order differential equations @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "away from the critical point @xmath26 , the usual scaling limits ( [ kbulk ] ) and ( [ kedge ] ) from random matrix theory continue to hold in the case @xmath4 ( also in the double scaling regime ) .",
    "this can be proved for example as in @xcite , and we will not consider this any further here .    theorem [ maintheo ] implies that local eigenvalue statistics of eigenvalues near @xmath71 are expressed in terms of the pearcey kernel .",
    "for example we have the following corollary of theorem [ maintheo ] .",
    "the probability that a matrix of the ensemble ( [ matrixmodel ] ) with @xmath72 has no eigenvalues in the interval @xmath73 $ ] converges , as @xmath6 , to the fredholm determinant of the integral operator with kernel @xmath74 acting on @xmath75 .",
    "similar expressions hold for the probability to have one , two , three ,  , eigenvalues in an @xmath76 neighborhood of @xmath26 .",
    "tracy and widom @xcite and adler and van moerbeke @xcite gave differential equations for the gap probabilities associated with the pearcey kernel and with the more general pearcey process which arises from considering the non - intersecting brownian motion model at several times near the critical time .",
    "see also @xcite where the pearcey process appears in a combinatorial model on random partitions .",
    "brzin and hikami and also tracy and widom used a double integral representation for the kernel in order to establish theorem [ maintheo ] . in this paper",
    "we use the deift / zhou steepest descent method for the riemann - hilbert problem for multiple hermite polynomials .",
    "this method is less direct than the steepest descent method for integrals .",
    "however , an approach based on the riemann - hilbert problem may be applicable to more general situations , where an integral representation is not available .",
    "this is the case , for example , for the general ( non - gaussian ) unitary random matrix ensemble with external source @xmath77 with a general potential @xmath78 .",
    "the riemann - hilbert problem is formulated in section 2 .",
    "the asymptotic analysis of the riemann - hilbert problem presents a new feature that we feel is of importance in its own right .",
    "we will not use the pastur equation ( [ pasturequation ] ) which defines the @xmath79-functions and the riemann surface that corresponds to it , but instead we use a modified equation to define the @xmath79-functions .",
    "we discuss this in section 3 .",
    "the modification may be thought of in potential theoretic terms and we briefly discuss this in section 3 as well .    the anti - derivatives of the modified @xmath79-functions are introduced in section 4 and they play an important role in the steepest descent analysis of the riemann - hilbert problem in the rest of the paper .",
    "the main issue is the construction in section 8 of the local parametrix around @xmath71 with the aid of pearcey integrals .",
    "the modification of the @xmath79-functions is used here to be able to match the local pearcey parametrix with the outside parametrix . even so it turns out that we can not achieve the matching condition on a fixed circle around the origin , but only on circles with radii @xmath80 that decrease as @xmath12 increases .",
    "however , the circles are big enough to capture the behavior ( [ limitkernel ] ) which takes place at a distance to the origin of order @xmath81",
    ". the precise estimates that lead to the proof of theorem [ maintheo ] are given in the final sections 9 and 10 .",
    "as shown in our paper @xcite , the correlation kernel is expressed in terms of the solution to the following @xmath9 matrix valued riemann - hilbert ( rh ) problem .",
    "find @xmath82 such that    * @xmath83 is analytic on @xmath84 , * for @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 where @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) denotes the limit of @xmath89 as @xmath90 from the upper ( lower ) half - plane , * as @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the @xmath94 identity matrix .    the rh problem has a unique solution , given explicitly in terms of the multiple hermite polynomials .",
    "the correlation kernel of the gaussian random matrix model with external source is equal to @xmath95    in what follows we are going to apply the deift / zhou steepest descent method for rh problems to the above rh problem for @xmath83 .",
    "it consists of a sequence of explicit transformations @xmath96 which leads to a rh problem for @xmath97 in which all jumps are close to the identity matrix and which is normalized at infinity .",
    "then @xmath97 is close to the identity matrix , and analyzing the effect of the transformations on the kernel ( [ corrkernel ] ) we will be able to prove theorem [ maintheo ] .",
    "the analysis in @xcite for the cases @xmath7 and @xmath8 was based on the equation ( [ pasturequation ] ) and it would be natural to use ( [ pasturequation ] ) also in the case @xmath4 . indeed , that is what we tried to do , and we found that it works for @xmath98 , but in the double scaling regime @xmath99 with @xmath100 , it led to problems that we were unable to resolve in a satisfactory way . a crucial feature of our present approach is a modification of the equation ( [ pasturequation ] ) when @xmath59 is close to @xmath101 , but different from @xmath101 . at @xmath26",
    "we wish to have a double branch point for all values of @xmath59 so that the structure of the riemann surface is as in the middle figure of figure [ fig1 ] for all @xmath59 .    for @xmath102",
    ", we consider the riemann surface for the equation @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a new auxiliary variable .",
    "the riemann surface has branch points at @xmath105 , @xmath106 and a double branch point at @xmath71 .",
    "there are three inverse functions @xmath107 , @xmath108 , that behave as @xmath109 as @xmath110 and which are defined and analytic on @xmath111 $ ] , @xmath112 $ ] and @xmath113 $ ] , respectively .",
    "then we define the modified @xmath79-functions @xmath114 which we also consider on their respective riemann sheets . in what follows",
    "we take @xmath115 note that @xmath25 corresponds to @xmath116 and @xmath117 . in that case",
    "the functions coincide with the solutions of the equation ( [ pasturequation ] ) that we used in our earlier works . from ( [ rseq ] ) , ( [ defxik ] ) , and ( [ defc ] ) we obtain the modified pastur equation @xmath118 where @xmath119 is given by ( [ defc ] ) .",
