    "the results presented in this section have been obtained using the values : @xmath118  mev , @xmath119 mev , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , adjusted to obtain the best possible description of available data on @xmath0-decay half - lifes  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : thalf ] we display @xmath0-decay half - lives calculated with the finite - range droplet model ( frdm ) + qrpa  @xcite ( red squares ) and the microscopic rhb+rqrpa model ( effective interaction d3c * )  @xcite ( blue diamonds ) , in comparison to available data  @xcite . in the top panel results for the isotopes of silver ( @xmath122 ) are shown for @xmath123 .",
    "a prominent feature is the relatively large discrepancy between model predictions for nuclei close to stability .",
    "the rhb+rqrpa ( d3c * ) results reproduce the empirical half - lives and follow closely the decreasing trend of the data , except in the case of @xmath124ag .",
    "the half - life of this nucleus is shorter by two orders of magnitude compared to neighboring isotopes , and this is very difficult to reproduce in model calculations .",
    "the frdm reproduces the decay rate of @xmath124ag but systematically underestimates the decay half - lives of longer - lived isotopes . at the very neutron - rich side",
    "both models predict results in good agreement with data .",
    "we notice , however , that the frdm results display a sudden deviation from the general trend ( between @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) by as much as an order of magnitude , while the d3c*-based rhb+rqrpa predicts a very smooth mass dependence of the decay half - lives .    in the case of the cadmium isotopic chain ( @xmath127 ) , the predictions of the two models are in better agreement and , generally , both models reproduce the data",
    ". systematic deviations from the experimental values and rhb+rqrpa results are apparent in the frdm predictions for the isotopes @xmath128 .",
    "one may notice that for both silver and cadmium isotopes the frdm results display an odd - even staggering , not observed in the data .",
    "this staggering and the systematic deviation from the data may have important consequences in r - process simulations and the resulting elemental abundances .    in both isotopic chains the main contribution to the decay rate originates from the very strong gamow - teller transition @xmath129 , especially for nuclei closer to stability .",
    "with the addition of more neutrons , in particular above the @xmath130 closed neutron shell , additional configurations become available and first - forbidden transitions produce a significant contribution to the total decay rate .    if fig  [ fig : ff ] we display the contribution of first - forbidden transitions to the total decay rate of silver and cadmium isotopes , from @xmath131 to @xmath132 . below the @xmath130",
    "closed neutron shell the contribution of first - forbidden transitions is rather small ( up to 10% ) , and limited to the @xmath133 @xmath134 configuration . above the closed shell , however ,",
    "the neutron orbital @xmath135 and , to a lesser extent @xmath136 , become partially occupied and contribute to both the @xmath137 and the @xmath138 transitions .",
    "the occupation of opposite parity states in the next neutron shell leads to the rapid increase of the contributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] above the neutron shell closure .",
    "an important property of @xmath0-unstable nuclei is the number of neutrons emitted after the decay , that is , the @xmath0-delayed neutron emission probability .",
    "the difference between the time scales of the @xmath0-decay and the subsequent particle emission process justifies the assumption of their statistical independence .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-delayed neutron emission is considered as a multi - step process that proceeds starting with the @xmath0-decay of the parent nucleus @xmath139 , followed by either the @xmath140 de - excitation of the daughter nucleus @xmath141 , or by the emission of a neutron and the formation of the final nucleus @xmath142 .",
    "the probability of emission of a single or multiple neutrons can be expressed  @xcite : @xmath143 with the assumption that the daughter nucleus will emit as many neutrons as energetically allowed . here , @xmath144 is the partial decay rate , @xmath145 the total decay rate , and the sum takes into account all transitions with energies between @xmath146 and @xmath147 neutron separation energies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : emission ] we compare the one ( @xmath148 ) and two ( @xmath149 ) neutron emission probabilities for silver and cadmium isotopes .",
    "the odd - even staggering of the probabilities is a direct consequence of the staggering of the neutron separation energies in the daughter nuclei .",
    "a nucleus with an even number of neutrons decays into a nucleus with an odd number of neutrons , i.e. the one - neutron separation energy @xmath150 is smaller in the daughter nucleus . in the case of a parent with an odd neutron number ,",
    "the decay is into a daughter nucleus with an even number of neutrons and a correspondingly larger @xmath150 . for a parent with an even number of neutrons the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sep ] ) takes into account a wider energy interval and this results in a higher neutron emission probability .    for the lighter isotopes of both chains , the two models",
    "( frdm + qrpa ( red squares ) and rhb+rqrpa ( d3c * ) ( blue diamonds ) ) predict a similar dominance of the one - neutron emission up to @xmath151 .",
    "significant differences are found above @xmath151 in silver isotopes .",
    "the frdm predicts very small values of @xmath148 , and comparatively much larger values of @xmath149 for nuclei up to @xmath132 , whereas the rhb+rqrpa ( d3c * ) yields a more gradual decrease of both @xmath148 and @xmath149 . above @xmath132",
    "both models give small values of @xmath148 and @xmath149 , because for very neutron - rich nuclei the emission of 3 or more neutrons dominates .",
    "the differences between model predictions are much less pronounced in the case of cd isotopes , especially for the two - neutron emission probability .",
    "weak - interaction processes provide valuable information on ground - state properties and the structure of excited states of a large number of nuclei that lie on both sides of the valley of @xmath0-stability .",
    "calculations of stellar nucleosynthesis , nuclear aspects of supernova collapse and explosion , and neutrino - induced reactions , necessitate as input properties of thousands of nuclei far from stability , including characteristics related to weak - interaction processes .",
    "many of these nuclei , especially on the neutron - rich side , are not accessible in experiments and their properties , therefore , must be determined using different theoretical approaches .",
    "one of these is the self - consistent mean - field method based on universal nuclear energy density functionals or global effective interactions , which can be applied in the description of arbitrarily heavy nuclei , exotic nuclei far from stability , and even nuclei at the nucleon drip - lines .",
    "we have reviewed some recent applications of a theoretical framework based on relativistic energy density functionals in modeling neutrino - nucleus reactions and calculation of @xmath0-decay rates .",
    "starting from a self - consistent mean - field solution for the nuclear ground state , a consistent proton - neutron relativistic quasiparticle random - phase approximation is used to calculate collective excited states in daughter nuclei and compute cross sections and transition rates .",
    "the model has very successfully been applied not only to the weak - interaction processes described in the present article , but also to muon capture and stellar electron capture  @xcite .",
    "the principal advantage of using this approach is the ability to perform systematic calculations of weak - interaction rates in nuclei of arbitrary mass along the @xmath152-process path , based on microscopic self - consistent mean - field potentials rather than empirical potentials , and the inclusion of transitions of arbitrary multipolarity .",
    "future developments will include the exploration of more complex configurations , e.g. particle - vibration coupling effects , a systematic treatment of finite - temperature effects , and the extension of the rhb+rqrpa model to explicitly take into account quadrupole deformations .",
