    "population dynamics is one of the natural areas of application of the theory of stochastic processes : parameters of deterministic models are perturbed by random fluctuations in order to model the influence of an ever - changing environment consisting of a multitude of individual `` agents '' .",
    "analytical solutions are known for only a handful of such systems .",
    "a majority of physically important systems is accessible only via numerical simulations .",
    "it is , therefore , particularly important to thoroughly understand those few whose analytical properties are known and test how well the existing numerical methods can approximate them .",
    "when a rigorous mathematical statement can be made about a system described by a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) , one expects that it will be corroborated by numerical simulations or by an actual physical experiment , if the latter is possible : after all , an sde is a mathematical idealization of a physical reality that is discrete by its very nature .",
    "if the results of the two approaches , continuous time sde vs.  discrete time numerical simulations , do not agree , there are reasons for a serious concern .",
    "one of the most surprising results , reported recently by mao and co - workers in ref .",
    "@xcite , is the fact that a multiplicative noise can stabilize a  system whose deterministic counterpart is divergent .",
    "the class of systems discussed in that reference may comprise several interacting species but its simplest form , to which we will restrict ourselves within this paper , is described by a scalar langevin equation    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a gaussian white noise ( gwn ) , interpreted in the sense of ito , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 . if there is no noise , @xmath5 , the `` @xmath6 '' sign correspond to the well - known logistic equation , while the `` @xmath7 '' sign describes a `` population '' that diverges in a finite time .",
    "this latter case defies one of the ecological laws that a population should be self - limited  @xcite , although eq .",
    "( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) perhaps can be used to model explosive phenomena observed in some chemical , nuclear or stellar systems where a  divergence is interpreted as a  destruction of the original system . however , our primary purpose of discussing the `` @xmath7 '' sign is to present the suprising effects that noise can have on a  deterministically divergent system .",
    "it is rigorously shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for any nonzero noise , @xmath8 , if the system  ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) starts from a positive initial value , it will for all times remain positive and bounded almost surely , regardless of the choice of the sign inside the brackets .",
    "this means that even a  tiny addition of the noise can stabilize the system .",
    "we note that a proof of this statement runs in two stages : first it is proven that the system remains positive , and later this fact is used to prove that the system remains bounded .    apart from the formal proof , ref .",
    "@xcite provides several numerical examples .",
    "these examples , however , are much less convincing than the fine mathematical points they are supposed to illustrate .",
    "first , it is not clear whether the numerical trajectories presented are typical or handpicked `` best '' ones .",
    "second , the noise has been approximated by an uncorrelated bernoulli noise while it is believed that one should either use an exponentially correlated dichotomic noise and then take a certain double limit to simulate a gwn @xcite , or directly use good generators of a  gwn .",
    "we will see that the problem of simulating the system described by the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) is unexpectedly tricky : even though this system almost surely never diverges , we will show that its discretizations realized by several popular and well - established methods do diverge .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ distribution ] we construct stationary probability distributions corresponding to the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) .",
    "several interacting species may not converge to a stable fixed point even if their trajectories are bounded .",
    "they may display oscillations instead and may not have a stationary distribution .",
    "however , if there is only one species , finding its stationary distribution is a  straightforward task .",
    "we will show that systems whose deterministic dynamics are completely different may possess similar stationary distribution when perturbed by the noise . then in sections  [ numerics ] and  [ higher ] we will discuss how to simulate the system ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) .",
    "in particular , we will show that there is an `` optimal '' noise level that maximizes the average lifespan of a discretized system .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) leads to the following fokker - planck equation :    @xmath9 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2 } \\left[x^4p(x , t)\\right].\\ ] ]    a stationary solution to this equation can be easily found by standard methods @xcite .",
    "it is , however , instructive to take a different approach .",
    "we make a substitution    @xmath10    note that because @xmath11 is nonnegative almost surely , the substitution ( [ marion : substitution ] ) is always valid , i.e.  we do not risk a  division by zero almost surely . as a result of this substitution , the fokker - planck equation ( [ marion : fokker ] ) in the ito interpretation is transformed into  @xcite    @xmath12 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p(y , t)}{\\partial y^2}\\,,\\ ] ]    which , in turn , corresponds to the following langevin equation :    @xmath13    the deterministic part of this equation describes an overdamped motion in a `` potential ''    @xmath14    we can see that the noise interpreted in the sense of ito introduces a barrier preventing @xmath15 from crossing zero , or preventing the population @xmath11 from diverging , as predicted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "note that this barrier is absent if the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) is interpreted in the sense of stratonovich , and indeed there is no proof that the population @xmath11 does not explode in this case .",
    "finding the stationary solution to the equation ( [ marion : fokker - y ] ) is now a matter of a simple calculation :    @xmath16,\\ ] ]    or after transforming back to the original variable ,    @xmath17,\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 and the normalization constant equals    @xmath19    and @xmath20 is the error function .",
    "it is easy to verify that for any positive value of @xmath21 , and for both choices of the sign , the normalization constant @xmath22 is positive and finite .",
    "the distribution ( [ marion : stationary - x ] ) is the stationary probability distribution corresponding to the equation ( [ marion : fokker ] ) with the constraint @xmath23 .",
    "it reaches a maximum at @xmath24 .",
    "observe that the `` @xmath6 '' sign in ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) and the subsequent equations corresponds to a  noisy logistic equation ; the corresponding deterministic system is certainly stable and never diverges",
    ". the sign `` @xmath7 '' corresponds to a system whose deterministic counterpart diverges very rapidly .",
    "however , the choice of this sign has very little effect on the shape and properties of the distribution ( [ marion : stationary - x ] ) .",
    "it is indeed very surprising that two systems whose deterministic behaviours differ so dramatically have very similar stationary distributions when driven by a gwn .",
    "when one deals with a langevin equation in the form    @xmath25    and does not know a stationary distribution corresponding to it , the usual way to proceed is to use an appropriate discretization in time , solve such system numerically , let it `` equilibrate '' for a certain time and try to reconstruct the ( unknown ) stationary distribution from the numerical trajectories . if @xmath2 is a gwn , the celebrated euler - maruyama scheme is most frequently used for this purpose . in this scheme",
    "the numerical trajectory is generated by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the time step and @xmath28 is a discrete gaussian white noise : @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the euler - maruyama scheme is consistent with the equation ( [ marion : langevin ] ) in the ito interpretation in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "this scheme is numerically very cheap but its strong order of convergence is rather small , @xmath32  @xcite .    simulating the noisy logistic equation , corresponding to a  `` @xmath6 '' in the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) ,",
    "does not pose any particular problem . we will , therefore , focus on simulating the system whose deterministic counterpart diverges .",
    "if we apply the euler - maruyama scheme to the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) , we can see that the population is prevented from exploding by sudden jumps down .",
    "the amplitude of these jumps is scaled by the square of the current value of the population : the higher the system climbs , the lower it can drop . large jumps up are equally possible , but a long series of jumps up is unlikely .",
    "if @xmath33 is large , even a small ( and positive ) value of @xmath28 introduces a  significant increase in the population size . in the next step",
    ", however , the probabilities of jumping up and down are equal and even a smaller to the absolute value but negative @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) can undo the cumulative effect of several jumps up as it is scaled by a much larger factor . we know that the ideal , continuous time system neither diverges , nor becomes negative , but the discretization scheme ( [ marion : euler ] ) applied to the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) may not obey these principles .",
    "if the current magnitude of the population becomes too large _ or _ negative , the model ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) clearly looses any physical meaning .",
    "we say that the numerical trajectory becomes unphysical either if @xmath37 or if @xmath38 and stop the simulation when either of these situations occurs .",
    "observe that the sequence @xmath39 does not converge to zero without becoming negative : the probability    @xmath40    becomes negligible for @xmath41 . on the other hand , the probability",
    "that @xmath42 becomes negative equals    @xmath43    this probability goes to zero in the limit @xmath31 , which is nothing more than a  consistency check of the euler - maruyama scheme , but is nonzero for any @xmath44 and any @xmath45 .",
    "this means that after a certain , perhaps very large but finite , number of iterations , the euler - maruyama scheme _ will _",
    "produce a negative , i.e.unphysical , value .",
    "thus , the discretized system has a finite lifespan , i.e. the time after which the system , when started from a positive initial value , either becomes negative or exceedingly large .",
    "observe that if @xmath41 , probability ( [ marion : negative ] ) is very small and increases with an increasing value of @xmath33 . if @xmath46 , probability ( [ marion : negative ] ) reaches a constant value , @xmath47 , which may be quite large ; for example , for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "we can see that it is easier for a discretized version of system ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) to cross zero if the current value of the process , or the current population , is large than when it is small .",
    "this conclusion is well confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "events in which @xmath33 becomes larger than the threshold value @xmath51 are very rare . if @xmath33 becomes large , it is more likely for it to decrease in a sudden jump and start its way up again , or even become negative when the simulation stops than gradually climb up towards the threshold .",
    "if the noise intensity , @xmath52 , is very small , the `` stopping effect '' of the noise is limited : the population can build up beyond the threshold or , more likely , to such a value where the probability of the next iterate becoming negative is significant despite the small value of @xmath52 . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath53 , the probability ( [ marion : negative ] )",
    "goes to @xmath54 and the system becomes unphysical very rapidly .",
    "therefore , we expect the lifespan of a system with a very small or very large noise intensity to be short . there should be an `` optimal '' range of the intensity of the noise in which the noise effectively stops the system from climbing too high and at the same time the probability ( [ marion : negative ] ) has a modest value .",
    "lifespans of the system with such a noise intensity should be larger than for either small or large noise intensities .",
    ") discretized by the euler - maruyama scheme ( [ marion : euler ] ) as a function of the noise amplitude , @xmath52 .",
    "the lifespan and @xmath52 are dimensionless .",
    "the line connecting the points is meant as a guide for the eye only . ]",
    "we have performed numerical simulations to verify this .",
    "we have generated trajectories of the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) according to euler - maruyama scheme with a time step @xmath55 .",
    "the noise has been generated by marsaglia algorithm @xcite with mersenne twister as the underlying uniform generator @xcite .",
    "the simulations were stopped when @xmath42 became negative or larger than @xmath56 ; the latter events were very rare . for each value of @xmath52 ,",
    "the lifespans were averaged over 1024 realizations of the process .",
    "results are presented on figure  [ marion : fig - m1 ] . as we can see , the average lifespan increases rapidly as @xmath52 increases , reaches a plateau , and then gradually decreases .",
    "these results show clearly that there is a range of `` optimal '' noise intensities that maximize the lifespan of the discretized process .",
    "a precise location of the maximum is not particularly important as it may depend on realizations of the noise .",
    "the average lifespan displays a strong dependence on the time step used to perform the simulations : the average lifespans increase ( decrease ) with a decreasing ( increasing ) value of the time step ,  @xmath27 , and this increase ( decrease ) can be quite significant .",
    "however , with very short time steps , the time needed to perform any realistic simulations gets prohibitively large .",
    "data gathered during the simulations were also used to draw `` experimental '' histograms of the distribution ( [ marion : stationary - x ] ) .",
    "specifically , from all realizations with @xmath48 and lifespans equal or greater than @xmath57 , values of @xmath58 for @xmath59 were collected , binned in intervals of the size @xmath60 , averaged over the respective number of realizations and compared with histograms obtained from the theoretical distribution .",
    "selected results are presented on figure  [ marion : fig - histo ] .",
    "the agreement between theory and numerical experiment is very good for @xmath61 , meaning that the euler - maruyama scheme reproduces properties of the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) well .",
    "results outside this interval are worse because few sufficiently long trajectories were available and the statistics was poor ; for large @xmath52 one should also use a smaller bin size .",
    "sometimes there is a need to use a higher order discretization scheme .",
    "several such methods are known in literature and in this section we will discuss performance of two of them .",
    "one is the heun method @xcite which many people , including the present author , have applied on several occasions with a great success .",
    "however , when this method is used to discretize the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) , it leads to negative values of the population very rapidly .",
    "the reason for this apparent failure is the fact that the heun method is consistent with the equation ( [ marion : langevin ] ) in the stratonovich , not ito , interpretation .",
    "the other method , perhaps less popular among physicists , is the milstein scheme  @xcite :    @xmath62    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are as in the equation ( [ marion : euler ] ) and @xmath63 .",
    "the milstein scheme differs from euler - maruyama only in the last term and this term vanishes if the noise is purely additive ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "its computational burden depends on how difficult it is to evaluate the derivative . in case of a simple polynomial",
    "the overall cost does not exceed twice that for the euler - maruyama method .    when this method is applied to the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) , we find for the probability of the next iterate becoming negative    @xmath65    where    @xmath66    provided that @xmath67 ; otherwise @xmath42 can not become negative .",
    "this last condition means that if    @xmath68     but for the milstein scheme ( [ marion : milstein ] ) .",
    "the lifespan and @xmath52 are in the same units as on fig .",
    "[ marion : fig - m1 ] . ]",
    "the next iterate must be positive .",
    "for a small time step or for a small noise intensity , @xmath69 can be large .",
    "this is good news as this prevents the discretized system from becoming unphysical . on the other hand , in the limit of a very strong noise ,",
    "@xmath70 which is much larger than the corresponding value for the euler - maruyama scheme . the same happens if @xmath33 becomes large which is likely if the noise intensity is small .",
    "there is a trade off between preventing the system from becoming unphysical for small values of the population and a rapid divergence once the populations builds up sufficiently large . as values of @xmath33",
    "are moderate for most of the time , we expect that the milstein scheme would lead to larger lifespans than euler - maruyama , but the qualitative picture is much the same as in the latter : the lifespans for both small and large noise intensities are small and there is a range of noise intensities that maximize the average lifespan .",
    "these predictions have been confirmed numerically .",
    "simulations were run under the same conditions as in case of the euler - maruyama scheme .",
    "results are presented on figure  [ marion : fig - m2 ] .",
    "indeed , the average lifespans first increase , then reach a range of elevated values , and eventually decrease .",
    "note that the maximal lifespans are more than two times larger than those for the euler - maruyama scheme .",
    "the structure seen on figure  [ marion : fig - m2 ] ( there are apparently two maxima visible ) does not necessarily correspond to any realistic properties of the iteration ( [ marion : milstein ] ) applied to the equation ( [ marion : eksplozja ] ) . rather than that",
    ", this structure may reflect a very pronounced stochastic variability of the system : with the milstein scheme , an _",
    "average _ lifespan of the order of @xmath71 corresponds to a pool of runs with lifespans ranging from very short ( @xmath72 ) to very large ( @xmath73 ) values .",
    "it is well known that a discretization can dramatically change properties of a dynamical system .",
    "the deterministic logistic equation is one classic example : its continuous version is perfectly regular but after the discretization , the logistic equation may display dynamical chaos . here",
    "we have a system  incidentally , closely related to the logistic equation  which , when modelled via the continuous time sde , is mathematically proven to remain positive and bounded almost surely , but after a discretization it has a finite lifespan after which it becomes negative or diverges .",
    "we have argued that , for a given time step , there exists a noise level that is `` optimal '' in that it maximizes the average lifespan of the discretized system .",
    "our numerical results strongly support this argument .",
    "we stress that the stabilization effect is observed only in the ito interpretation .",
    "it is usually assumed that it is the physical interpretation of the stochastic force that should decide which interpretation of the noise , ito or stratonovich , should be used  @xcite .",
    "one may argue , however , that a robust noise - induced stabilization should be oblivious to the noise interpretation . with this respect , reference  @xcite and the present paper",
    "provide an example of a system in which the consequences of the two approaches differ .",
    "in this paper we are lucky to numerically simulate a system whose analytical properties are fully known . in practice , it is systems whose analytical properties are not known that are examined by numerical simulations .",
    "if the simulations produce divergent results , one usually concludes that the lifespan of the system under consideration is finite .",
    "we have shown that such divergences can be merely an artefact of a discretization of a  sde .",
    "strangely , the above argument can also be reversed : a continuous time sde is a  mathematical idealization of a system that is discrete by its very nature .",
    "first , populations consist of discrete individuals .",
    "a  fractional @xmath11 can be interpreted only as a  fraction of a certain reference population . with @xmath74 ,",
    "this interpretation breaks and so may break a  model based on a  continuous sde .",
    "second , it is assumed that the stochastic force acts continually .",
    "this idealization is fully justified when the characteristic time scale of the elementary random events is many orders of magnitude smaller that the characteristic time scale of a  macroscopic process , which is the case for example in the classical diffusion . however , when an sde is used to describe a biological or ecological process , the separation of time scales is less perfect .",
    "for instance , in a biological process the characteristic time of `` random '' changes in environmental conditions can be of the order of seconds , and the characteristic time of the macroscopic process , like changes in a population , can be of the order of days .",
    "in such a case the characteristic time scales are separated by only five orders of magnitude , much as in the numerical examples reported above . as a  result , a process that is deterministically divergent may remain so even after a  stochastic perturbation is applied , even though solutions to a corresponding continuous time sde remain bounded almost surely .",
