    "the original ads / cft conjecture by maldacena  @xcite has played a pivotal role to study strongly coupled systems through their duality with supergravity theories at a large number of colors . in recent years",
    "there have been attempts to extend the gauge / string duality to incorporate genuine qcd effects such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "incorporating such effects is subject to a certain degree of arbitrariness , and the ads / cft correspondence can only be used as a guiding principle . however , the phenomenological success of such models is quite remarkable , especially with vector mesons  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to extend this analysis to antisymmetric tensors of rank two .",
    "there are two main motivations to pursue this program .",
    "the first comes from qcd : while @xmath2 is the paradigmatic current to create spin-1 vector mesons , the antisymmetric tensor current @xmath3 is also known to generate spin-1 states , not only the conventional @xmath1 vector mesons but also the more exotic @xmath0 mesons .",
    "therefore , the study of antisymmetric currents not only provides a description of @xmath0 mesons , but also involves a nontrivial interplay with @xmath1 mesons .",
    "such interplay has been studied in qcd by a simultaneous analysis of the two - point correlators @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this simultaneous analysis is highly constraining , and we would like to understand whether simple holographic settings with the ads / cft correspondence can offer a satisfactory description of these correlators .",
    "a more formal motivation comes from the gravity side .",
    "the spectrum of compactified @xmath7 type - ii b supergravity on ads@xmath8 typically contains massive rank two antisymmetric tensors  @xcite .",
    "massive 2-forms have already been studied in the context of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . in this work",
    "we want to examine their role in holographic models of qcd .",
    "according to the ads / cft dictionary , @xmath9-forms with five - dimensional masses @xmath10 coupled to currents with conformal dimension @xmath11 satisfy @xmath12 following the ads / cft prescription for correlators developed in  @xcite , the on - shell fields on the gravitational side are to be identified with the sources of the gauge theory currents .",
    "however , in order to bring the ads / cft correspondence closer to qcd one needs further ingredients , _",
    "e.g. _ , fields in the fundamental representation and a mechanism for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the former can be accomplished through embeddings of probe branes , as shown in  @xcite , while the latter has been studied in several nonsupersymmetric backgrounds  @xcite and most successfully realized in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will lean on the previous results but follow a more phenomenological approach , in the spirit of  @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that a 1-form massless field on the gravity side stands as the natural candidate to study processes involving the qcd conserved current @xmath2 .",
    "likewise , we argue that a 2-form field , due to its antisymmetric nature , is to be naturally associated with the tensor current @xmath3 . in the following we will show that this assignment leads to consistent results .",
    "however , the first thing to realize is that , as can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ ads ] ) , we will be dealing with massive 2-form fields .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the tensor current is not conserved in qcd but implies that , in contrast to the vector case , all degrees of freedom of the 2-form will be physical . as we will discuss later on in detail",
    ", this will have far - reaching phenomenological consequences .    throughout the paper we will be working with a minimal action for 1- and 2-forms , namely that containing only the five - dimensional kinetic terms .",
    "therefore , there will be no coupling between vector and antisymmetric tensors in the gravity side , and it is not clear _ a priori _ how the mixed correlator @xmath5 can be generated from the holographic point of view .",
    "we will see that holography provides a very natural scenario for this interplay between qcd currents even starting with uncoupled @xmath9-forms in five dimensions . at the same time",
    ", mixed correlators such as @xmath5 turn out to be particularly sensitive to chiral symmetry breaking effects . however , such effects are more subtle than in correlators like @xmath13 or @xmath14 , which contain the pion pole .",
    "none of the correlators considered in this work contains the pion pole , and yet they signal the breaking of chiral symmetry . our aim in this paper is to stick to the simplest five - dimensional lagrangian and explore where and when the correlators require chiral symmetry breaking effects to appear . as is well - known , conformal symmetry needs to be broken to account for chiral symmetry breaking , typically through nontrivial boundary conditions in the infrared . we show that such infrared boundary conditions are strongly constrained , and therefore correlators with tensor currents turn out to be an ideal theoretical laboratory to understand how to implement chiral symmetry breaking in ads / cft .",
    "however , within the set of correlators considered , not all the requested chiral symmetry breaking effects can be introduced through infrared boundary conditions : changes in the bulk are also needed . in this paper",
    "we show that the impact of these changes can be effectively described by slightly modifying the conventional ads / cft prescription for correlators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ mathe ] we will apply the ads / cft prescription to 2-form fields in ads space with a compact fifth dimension . in sec .",
    "[ compar ] we compare the results obtained with the ones from 1-forms , paying special attention to the role played by gauge invariance .",
    "section  [ pheno ] is devoted to the phenomenological analysis : correlators are defined and the issue of boundary conditions is discussed . in sec .  [ num ] we discuss the matching to qcd and the low energy limit of the correlators , providing predictions for low energy parameters and assessing issues like lowest meson dominance .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "an interesting result of our analysis is that , quite generally , consistency with generic properties of qcd precludes the presence of dilaton fields in the action .",
    "this implies that in order to achieve regge behavior in holographic qcd , the introduction of a dilaton field does not provide a consistent picture .",
    "this is discussed in the appendix .",
    "the objects we are interested in are generic @xmath9-form fields in the supergravity side , which will be described by the following action : @xmath15~,\\ ] ] which satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "the integral above is over @xmath17 dimensions , and we will adopt the setting where the fifth dimension is finite and delimited by two boundary branes at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the fifth dimension coordinate .",
    "our conventions for the ads metric are the usual ones : @xmath21 with @xmath22 mostly negative .",
    "we also include an overall factor @xmath23 in the action , which in principle could be determined from a more fundamental string theory",
    ".    in this paper we will be mainly interested in 2-forms , _ i.e. _ , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the bulk to boundary propagator of every field in the gravity side corresponds to a current in the gauge theory side . as discussed in the introduction , a natural candidate for a rank two antisymmetric current in qcd",
    "is @xmath3 , and therefore we will identify @xmath26 as the source of @xmath27 .",
    "it is well - known that in qcd @xmath27 can generate @xmath0 mesons through @xmath28 a representative candidate being the @xmath29 state .",

    "since @xmath33 , the states should have opposite parity .",
    "note the analogy with the electric and magnetic fields inside the faraday tensor .",
    "since @xmath1 states can also be generated by @xmath2 , in order to be consistent we should also include 1-forms in our analysis . in the literature it is common to interpret @xmath27 as the generator of longitudinal @xmath34 mesons , while @xmath35 creates the conventional ( transverse ) @xmath34 mesons .    in components the action ( [ nform ] ) for 2-form fields reads @xmath36~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and",

    "therefore , through kaluza - klein reduction the 10 degrees of freedom of @xmath41 split into a field @xmath44 with 6 components and another field @xmath45 with the remaining 4 .",

    "this coincidence is a direct consequence of dimensional reduction in pure ads spaces , as we will show in the appendix , and will be extremely important in the interpretation of @xmath45 in terms of qcd currents .",

    "let us investigate the consequences of @xmath73 a bit further .",

    ", @xmath45 does not have an obvious interpretation in terms of qcd currents .",
    "however , unlike @xmath79 , it can not be removed by appealing to gauge symmetry , and therefore it must have a physical effect",
    ".    direct inspection of eq .",
    "( [ corrtt ] ) shows that there are two potential correlators .",
    "since @xmath44 can be associated with the tensor current , the term quadratic in @xmath44 will naturally generate the tensor correlator @xmath6 .",
    "the nature of the coupling between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is reminiscent of the one between @xmath58 and @xmath79 and suggests that one should naturally identify the mixed term with @xmath5 .",
    "this correlator is zero in a conformal theory of quarks , but sensitive to chiral symmetry breaking effects .",
    "therefore , its nonvanishing signals the breaking of chiral symmetry and is demanded by qcd . as we will see later on , in the large-@xmath91 limit @xmath5",
    "is saturated by the exchange of @xmath34 mesons .",
    "therefore , the fact that @xmath58 and @xmath45 are described by the same equation of motion is crucial to have a viable phenomenological description of @xmath5 .",
    "we have thus found a remarkable property of holographic ads models : @xmath45 is the vector generator for @xmath5 , just as @xmath58 was the vector generator for @xmath4 .",
    "this way holography can account for mixed correlators without actually mixing @xmath9-forms in the five - dimensional action . for consistency , the only thing one has to make sure is that no double - counting takes place , which is guaranteed by the absence of a quadratic term in @xmath45 in the action .",
    "note that this picture crucially depends on the fact that @xmath73 , which is supported by gauge invariance .",
    "most interestingly , as we show in the appendix , the picture is consistent only in ads space without ( nontrivial ) dilaton fields .",
    "thus , one immediate consequence is that dilaton - based mechanisms to implement linear confinement in vector mesons  @xcite will fail to account for @xmath5 .",
    "having understood the structure and interplay of vectors and antisymmetric tensors , we can now turn to the study of the phenomenological aspects of its associated correlators .",
    "in the following we will concentrate on the charged @xmath95 flavor currents @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath98 and @xmath99 with a flavor spurion @xmath100 .",
    "we define the tensor correlator as @xmath101 where in the second line we have decomposed it in terms of parity - even and parity - odd scalar invariants .",
    "the tensor structures @xmath102 are given by @xmath103 and can be shown to be parity projectors . in the following it will prove convenient to define the correlator @xmath104 , which is the simplest order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking in the tensor sector , very similar to its counterpart @xmath105 in the vector / axial - vector sector .",
    "we will also consider the vector correlator @xmath106 and the mixed correlator @xmath107 according to the ads / cft correspondence , the currents appearing in the previous set of correlators are in one to one correspondence with on - shell fields evaluated on the uv brane .",
    "therefore , given the action for vector and tensor fields , @xmath108\\bigg|_{\\epsilon}^{y_m}~,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can readily obtain two - point correlators by differentiating with respect to the sources .",
    "close to the origin , a generic @xmath9-form @xmath109 behaves like @xmath110 where @xmath111 are identified as gauge theory sources  @xcite .",
    "the previous prescription would however fail to properly account for the known high - energy qcd behavior of both @xmath5 and @xmath112 .",
    "in particular , according to  ( [ scaling ] ) , @xmath112 would be predicted to diverge logarithmically , as dictated by conformal invariance .",
    "however , qcd predicts @xmath112 to converge instead like @xmath113 .",
    "this is not so surprising bearing in mind that both @xmath5 and @xmath112 are , after all , pure manifestations of chiral symmetry breaking and hence completely unrelated to conformal invariance .",
    "this failure to describe @xmath5 and @xmath112 therefore can be seen as a manifestation that conformal invariance and chiral symmetry breaking are not compatible when it comes to the description of _ direct _ order parameters .",
    "the breakdown of the ads / cft recipe thus points at the necessity of nonperturbative physics away from the conformal limit .    in what follows",
    "we will show that instead the phenomenologically - motivated prescription @xmath114 indeed complies with the fundamental requirements of qcd .",
    "insofar as it is motivated by phenomenology our prescription should be interpreted as an effective _ ad hoc _ way to account for the nonconformal aspects that define @xmath5 and @xmath112 , namely chiral symmetry breaking but also more general nonperturbative phenomena . in particular",
    ", our prescription should capture the fact that the tensor current @xmath27 , unlike the vector @xmath35 , has a nonperturbative dimension different from the conformal one .",
    "this is to be expected given that @xmath27 is not conserved and therefore @xmath115 at strong coupling .    in the following",
    "it will prove convenient to split the fields as @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",

    "one of the advantages of holographic qcd models over four - dimensional ones is that one starts from a lagrangian formulation .",
    "therefore , one expects the whole set of correlators to show up naturally and provide a self - consistent picture . in this paper",
    "we have shown in detail how this interplay is realized in holographic models .",
    "it is not obvious how a correlator like @xmath5 can be generated starting from the free action for 2-forms in five dimensions .",
    "however , we have seen that such mixing arises naturally in the process of compactification .",
    "quite generally , given a @xmath9-form in five dimensions , a @xmath262-form is always dynamically generated by dimensional reduction and realized as the fifth component of the @xmath9-form .",

    "quite remarkably , they come out with the right mass assignments to be consistent with ads / cft : the scalar component of a dimensionally - reduced massless 1-form is a scalar with @xmath88 , while the vector component of a dimensionally - reduced massive 2-form is a massless 1-form . therefore ,",
    "mixed correlators in holography are natural side - products of four - dimensional compactification .",
    "it is worth noting that if the initial @xmath9-form happens to be massless , then gauge symmetry can be used to remove the mixed correlator .",

    "however , @xmath45 can not be regarded as a gauge artifact and @xmath5 actually turns out to be nonvanishing , in accord with qcd .",
    "this identification , however , crucially depends on the metric being pure ads without dilaton fields .",
    "therefore , dilaton - based mechanisms in the spirit of  @xcite , designed to display linear confinement in the vector meson spectrum , fail to provide an acceptable phenomenological description of @xmath5 .    another interesting point to notice",
    "is that those mixed correlators are order parameters of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . as such",
    ", their main contribution should naturally come from the infrared brane .",
    "nontrivial boundary conditions on the infrared brane are therefore required , which are somehow related to the existence of a quark condensate .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking is therefore triggered by infrared boundary effects .",
    "however , we have seen that this is not the full story .",
    "the holographic computation of @xmath6 is not free of subtleties . in particular , a direct computation",
    "can only be made on the chiral symmetry breaking correlator @xmath112 .",
    "the ads / cft prescription fails to reproduce the right high - energy behavior for this object , implying that conformal invariance needs to be broken beyond infrared boundary terms .",
    "ideally , one should understand how chiral symmetry breaking should be implemented at a lagrangian level . instead ,",
    "in this paper we have made the observation that an _ ad hoc _ modification of the prescription restores agreement with qcd . while this is not fully satisfactory from a formal standpoint , it is certainly enough for phenomenological purposes .",
    "using this phenomenologically - motivated prescription , we have found that the scenario displayed by holography successfully predicts the presence of @xmath1 states in @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in particular ,",
    "the resonance contributions to @xmath5 form an alternate series , in compliance with sum rule analyses and general expectations from qcd  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 states contribute to @xmath6 and are predicted to be doubly dense with respect to @xmath1 with masses sitting at the zeros of both @xmath151 and @xmath189 .",
    "half of this spectrum is therefore degenerate with @xmath1 and the other half with the @xmath209 states in the scenario studied in  @xcite .",
    "additionally , since the decay constants @xmath30 and @xmath263 are predicted to be proportional to the infrared boundary value , if chiral symmetry were exact they would vanish altogether . in other words , in the limit of unbroken chiral symmetry , tensor currents do not couple to spin-1 particles .    finally , we have assessed lowest meson dominance in the determination of the low - energy parameter @xmath228 , which is of interest in the hadronic light - by - light scattering contribution to the @xmath264 .",

    "<S> we study real ( massive ) antisymmetric tensors of rank two in holographic models of qcd based on the gauge / string duality . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to understand in detail how the ads / cft correspondence describes correlators with tensor currents in qcd . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we study a set of bootstrapped correlators with spin-1 vector and tensor currents , imposing matching to qcd at the partonic level . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a consistent description of this set of correlators yields a very predictive picture . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it imposes strong constraints on infrared boundary conditions and precludes the introduction of dilatonic backgrounds as a mechanism to achieve linear confinement . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , correlators with tensor currents turn out to be especially sensitive to chiral symmetry breaking , thus offering an ideal testing ground for genuine qcd effects . </S>",
    "<S> several phenomenological consequences are explored , such as the nontrivial interplay between @xmath0 states and conventional @xmath1 vector mesons . </S>"
