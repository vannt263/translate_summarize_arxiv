    "the importance of the hanle effect as a diagnostic tool of the quiet sun magnetism can not be overestimated .",
    "this magnetic - field - induced modification of the linear polarization due to scattering in spectral lines is even sensitive to the presence of magnetic fields that are randomly oriented at scales too small to be resolved ( stenflo 1982 ) . applying novel diagnostic techniques based on the hanle effect , trujillo bueno et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reached the following conclusions ( see also trujillo bueno et al .",
    "2006 ) :    * the quiet solar photosphere is permeated by a small - scale tangled magnetic field , whose average strength at heights @xmath4 km above the visible solar surface is @xmath2 g when no distinction is made between granular and intergranular regions . *",
    "the downward - moving intergranular lane plasma is pervaded by relatively strong tangled magnetic fields at subresolution scales , with @xmath5 g. this conclusion suggests that most of the flux and magnetic energy reside on still unresolved scales . * in the upper photosphere the ensuing energy flux estimated using the typical value of @xmath6 for the convective velocity ( thinking in rising magnetic loops ) or the alfvn speed ( thinking in alfvn waves generated by magnetic reconnection ) turns out to be substantially larger than that required to balance the radiative energy losses from the quiet chromosphere .",
    "the first conclusion was obtained by contrasting low resolution observations of the scattering polarization signals of the sr i 4607   line with three - dimensional ( 3d ) radiative transfer calculations in a realistic 3d model of the quiet solar photosphere obtained from the hydrodynamical ( hd ) simulations of asplund et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( hereafter the hd model ) .",
    "the second conclusion resulted from combining the information provided by the strontium line with that we obtained through the application of the hanle effect line ratio technique for c@xmath7 lines explained carefully in trujillo bueno et al .",
    "it is however important to note that the above - mentioned hd model is unmagnetized and that , therefore , such conclusions are based on the following hypotheses for the quiet sun magnetic field that produces hanle depolarization : ( 1 ) the magnetic field is tangled at scales smaller than the mean free path of the line - center photons , with an isotropic distribution of directions and ( 2 ) the shape of the probability density function ( pdf ) , describing the fraction of the quiet sun photosphere occupied by magnetic fields of strength @xmath8 , is exponential ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to determine the strength of the magnetization of the quiet solar photosphere without making use of such two approximations . to this end",
    ", we investigate the hanle effect of the sr i 4607   line in a 3d photospheric model resulting from the magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of vgler & schssler ( 2007 ) , which show a complex small - scale magnetic field that results from dynamo amplification of a weak seed field .",
    "these authors went a step further than cattaneo ( 1999 ) by demonstrating that a realistic flow topology of stratified , compressible , surface convection without enforced recirculation is capable of local dynamo action near the solar surface .",
    "it is interesting to note that the small - scale `` hidden magnetic field '' inferred via the hanle effect lends support to the notion of a turbulent solar surface dynamo playing a significant role in the magnetism of the quiet sun ( e.g. , pietarila graham et al .",
    "2009 ; see also the reviews by lites 2009 , and by snchez almeida & martnez gonzlez 2011 ) .",
    "we calculated the number density of sr i atoms at each grid point of a 3d magneto - hydrodynamic model of the solar photosphere resulting from a non - gray radiative transfer version of the run - c simulation of vgler & schssler ( 2007 ) ( hereafter , the mhd model ) . to this end , we solved the standard 3d non - lte problem without polarization including all the allowed radiative and collisional transitions between the 15 bound levels of a realistic model of sr i and the ensuing ionizing transitions to the ground level of sr ii . with the resulting number density of sr i atoms fixed , we solved the full 3d radiative transfer problem of the scattering polarization in the sr i 4607   line by applying the complete frequency redistribution theory of resonance line polarization ( e.g. , landi deglinnocenti & landolfi 2004 ) , which is suitable for modeling the fractional linear polarization observed in weak resonance lines like that of sr i at 4607  ( see sampoorna et al . 2010 ; and references therein ) .    the sr i line at 4607   results from a single @xmath10 resonance line transition with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( the total angular momentum of its lower and upper levels , respectively ) .",
    "although the ensuing einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission is very large ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) the line originates in the solar photosphere because the abundance of strontium is relatively low ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "scattering polarization in the sr i 4607   line is caused only by the atomic polarization ( population imbalances and quantum coherences ) of its upper level , which results from anisotropic radiation pumping in the solar photosphere .",
    "the lower level can not be polarized and the relevant transfer equations for modeling the available low resolution observations of the fractional linear polarization signals are @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the stokes parameter @xmath16 , @xmath17 or @xmath18 at the frequency and direction of propagation under consideration ( @xmath19 defines the monochromatic optical path along the ray , @xmath20 being the absorption coefficient and @xmath21 the geometrical distance ) .",
    "the source function components are @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the planck function and @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 the line - integrated opacity , @xmath28 the continuum opacity and @xmath29 the normalized absorption profile ) .",
    "the expressions of the line source function components are identical to those used by trujillo bueno & shchukina ( 2007 ) , which are functions of the inclination and azimuth of the ray under consideration and of the following position - dependent quantities ( with @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 the multipolar components of the upper - level density matrix normalized to the overall population of the ground level ) .",
    "note that @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 ) are complex quantities ; thus , we will use @xmath38 and @xmath39 to denote , respectively , the real and imaginary parts of @xmath36 .",
    "the values of such quantities at each spatial grid point have to be found by solving the following coupled set of equations ( manso sainz & trujillo bueno 1999 ) :    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 the rate of inelastic collisions with electrons , in @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 the land factor of the upper level and @xmath8 the magnetic strength in gauss ) , @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 the upper - level depolarizing rate due to elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms ) , and @xmath50 . in these expressions , @xmath51 ( with @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 ) are the spherical components of the radiation field tensor ( landi deglinnocenti & landolfi 2004 ) , which are integrals over the frequency and direction of the stokes parameters weighted by the normalized absorption profile .",
    "thus , @xmath52 quantifies the familiar mean intensity of the incident radiation , @xmath53 its anisotropy , while @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( with @xmath37 ) denote , respectively , the real and imaginary parts of @xmath56 ( which measure the breaking of the axial symmetry of the incident radiation field ) .",
    "the @xmath57-coefficients depend on the inclination ( @xmath58 ) of the local magnetic field vector with respect to the vertical z - axis and on its azimuth ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the depolarizing rate , @xmath48 , is proportional to the neutral hydrogen number density ( see eq . 33 in faurobert - scholl et al .",
    "such formula for calculating @xmath60 results from an accurate quantum - mechanical derivation , and we point out that it leads to values similar to those we have obtained through the semi - classical theory of anstee & omara ( 1995 ) .",
    "the excellent agreement between the @xmath60 values obtained from the quantum and semi - classical approaches is a clear indication of the reliability of the @xmath60 values of our modeling , because the sr i 4607   line is a triplet type transition with spin s=0 ( i.e. , it is a spectral line for which the classical description holds ) .    of particular interest",
    "is the fact that the magnetic strength needed to reach any given depolarization is the larger the greater @xmath60 .",
    "this can be seen in the expression of the critical magnetic field strength for the onset of the hanle effect , which can be defined as the strength ( @xmath61 ) for which the hanle depolarization reduces the zero - field scattering polarization amplitude by about a factor of two",
    "( a16 ) of trujillo bueno & manso sainz ( 1999 ) implies that    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the critical hanle field in the collisionless regime ( i.e. , @xmath64 g for the sr i 4607   line ) .",
    "we point out that in the atmospheric region of formation of the sr i 4607   line ( i.e. , approximately between 250 km and 350 km for line of sights with @xmath65 in the mhd model ) the horizontally averaged @xmath61 value varies between 60 g and 40 g , approximately , with @xmath66 decreasing with height because @xmath67 decreases with height in the solar atmosphere ( following the density decrease ) . more or less similar @xmath61 values are found in one - dimensional semi - empirical models .",
    "it is also important to note that a _ lower limit _ for the hanle saturation field of the sr i 4607   line is @xmath68 , since full saturation is reached only for @xmath69 g.",
    "the results reported here were obtained through the self - consistent numerical solution of the equations , applying the methods mentioned in trujillo bueno & shchukina ( 2007 ) . in a first step we solved the scattering line polarization problem of the sr i 4607   line in the mhd surface dynamo model , but imposing @xmath70 g at each spatial grid point . the resulting @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "line - center signals are similar to those shown for three line - of - sights in figure 1 of trujillo bueno & shchukina ( 2007 ) , which were obtained by solving the same 3d radiative transfer problem in the above - mentioned hd model . for the moment , the scattering polarization observations of the sr i 4607   line that have been published lack spatial resolution ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we point out that when the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 profiles we have calculated in the mhd model are spatially averaged over scales significantly larger than that of the solar granulation pattern we obtain @xmath73 and the @xmath71 line - center amplitudes given by the black open circles of figure 2 . remarkably , these reference scattering polarization amplitudes are similar to those computed by trujillo bueno et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in the hd model ( see the green open circles ) .",
    "g when the same hypotheses mention in  1 are used to infer @xmath74 from calculations in the @xmath70 g version of the mhd model . ]",
    "the small but noticeable differences between the two curves are due to the fact that the thermodynamic structure of the mhd model is not as accurate as in the hd model , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 being slightly larger in the mhd model ( in the photospheric region where the @xmath71 profile of the strontium line originates , whose amplitude is approximately proportional to the product of such two quantities ) .",
    "the black dashed line shows the @xmath71 amplitudes that we obtain when taking into account the hanle depolarization produced by the actual magnetic field of the mhd model , whose magnetic reynolds number is @xmath77 .",
    "not surprisingly , the hanle depolarization produced by the model s magnetic field is too small to explain the observations .",
    "this is because the mean field strength at a height of about 300 km in the mhd model is only @xmath78 g ( i.e. , an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath74 value inferred by trujillo bueno et al . 2004 ) .",
    "clearly , the level of small - scale magnetic activity of the mhd surface dynamo model is significantly weaker than that of the real quiet sun photosphere .    in order to estimate the mean field strength of the quiet sun",
    "photosphere we scaled the magnetic strength at each spatial grid point by a constant factor , @xmath79 , till fitting the observations of figure 2 .",
    "we have done this keeping the magnetic field topology of the mhd model fixed .",
    "we find @xmath80 , which implies @xmath81 g at a height of 300 km above the  visible surface \" in the mhd model ( i.e. , an average field strength similar to that inferred by trujillo bueno et al .",
    "note that this result has now been reached without using the two hypotheses mentioned in  1 .",
    "curiously enough , a similar scaling factor is also found when one follows pietarila graham et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and assumes that the ratio between the magnetic strengths of the real solar photospheric plasma and of the original mhd surface dynamo model is equal to the square root of the ratio of the corresponding magnetic reynolds numbers , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . as shown by the dotted line of figure 3 , to scale the field strength of the mhd model with a constant scaling factor @xmath80 implies an unrealistic height - variation of @xmath74 . the ensuing large magnetic field strengths in the region of formation of the zeeman signals of the fe i lines at about 15650   and 6302   ( e.g. , around 60 km in the mhd model for the fe i 6302.5   line ; see figure 1 ) would produce synthetic stokes profiles in contradiction with those observed .",
    "in fact , @xmath84 is significantly larger than the tentative scaling factor 3 needed by danilovic et al . (",
    "2010 ) for explaining the histograms of the polarization signals produced by the zeeman effect in the 6301.5   and 6302.5   fe i lines .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath85 is too low a value for explaining the scattering polarization observations of figure 2 ( see the dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to fit the observational data of figure 2 without destroying the possibility of explaining the stokes profiles observed in the fe i lines , we have introduced a height - dependent scaling factor which leads to the solid line of figure 3 for the height variation of the mean field strength . as shown by the black solid line of figure 2 , the magnetic field that results from our height - dependent scaling factor produces a hanle depolarization in the sr i 4607   line that explains well the observations .",
    "it is also important to mention that a significant fraction of the model s granular plasma that contributes to the scattering polarization of the c@xmath7 lines mentioned in  1 is magnetized with @xmath86 .",
    "we have solved the radiative transfer problem of resonance polarization and the hanle effect of the sr i 4607   line in a 3d model of the quiet solar photosphere resulting from the magneto - convection simulations with surface dynamo action of vgler & schssler ( 2007 ) .",
    "we find that the level of magnetic activity in their surface dynamo model is too low for explaining the scattering polarization observations of the sr i 4607   line .",
    "the observed linear polarization amplitudes can however be explained after multiplying each grid - point magnetic strength by a scaling factor @xmath80 .",
    "a scaling factor @xmath80 is about three or four times larger than that required to explain the polarization induced by the zeeman effect in the fe i lines around 6302  .",
    "this discrepancy between the scaling factors needed to explain the hanle signals of the sr i 4607   line and the zeeman signals of the fe i lines disappears if we take into account that the zeeman signals originate a few hundred kilometers deeper than the hanle signals ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "in other words , with a height - dependent scaling factor that implies @xmath87 g in the low photosphere and @xmath88 g in the upper photosphere it is possible to explain approximately both types of observations .",
    "our investigation of the hanle effect in the above - mentioned surface dynamo model reinforces the conclusions of trujillo bueno et al .",
    "( 2004 ) summarized in  1 .",
    "in particular , the horizontal variation of the scaled magnetic field needed to fit the observations indicates that most of the flux and magnetic energy reside on still unresolved scales in the intergranular plasma .",
    "moreover , the fact that the magnetic energy density carried by this  hidden \" magnetic field is a significant fraction of the local kinetic energy density and that the scattering polarization amplitudes of the sr i line and of the c@xmath7 lines do not seem to be clearly modulated by the solar cycle ( trujillo bueno et al . 2004 ; kleint et al .",
    "2010 ) , support the suggestion that a small - scale turbulent surface dynamo plays a significant role in the magnetism of the  quiet \" sun .",
