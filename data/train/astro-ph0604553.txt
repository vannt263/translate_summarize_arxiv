    "in the standard , cold dark matter ( cdm ) based model for disk formation , set out by fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) , disks form out of gas that slowly cools out of a hot gaseous halo , associated with the dark matter potential well , while maintaining its specific angular momentum . during this process",
    "the dark matter halo contracts to conserve its adiabatic invariants ( blumenthal et  al .",
    "1986 ) . because of the centrifugal barrier the gas settles in a rotationally supported disk whose size is proportional to both the size and angular momentum of the dark matter halo ( mo , mao & white , 1998 ; hereafter mmw )",
    "consequently , the structure and dynamics of disk galaxies are expected to be strongly correlated with the properties of their dark matter halos . in particular , the correlations between the observable , structural parameters of disk galaxies , rotation velocity , @xmath12 , size , @xmath13 , and luminosity , @xmath14 , are expected to be a reflection of the virial properties of dark matter halos , which scale as @xmath15 .",
    "slight deviations from these scalings are expected from the fact that more massive halos are , on average , less concentrated .",
    "any further deviations must either reflect some aspects of the baryonic physics related to galaxy formation , or signal a failure in the standard picture outlined above . in what follows",
    "we refer to the relations between the global disk parameters as the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath16 relations .    in the past ,",
    "the @xmath0 relation , also known as the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) , has received much attention as a distance indicator owing to the relatively small observed scatter .",
    "although numerous studies have addressed the origin of the @xmath0 relation , no consensus has been reached .",
    "in particular , it is currently still under debate whether the origin of the @xmath0 relation is mainly governed by initial cosmological conditions ( e.g. , eisenstein & loeb 1996 ; avila - reese , firmani & hernndez 1998 ) , or by the detailed processes governing star formation ( silk 1997 ; heavens & jiminez 1999 ) and/or feedback ( e.g. , kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et  al .  1994 ; elizondo et  al .  1999 ; natarajan 1999 ) . in the most recent models ( van den bosch 2000 ; 2002 ;",
    "navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; firmani & avila - reese 2000 , hereafter fa00 ) it is typically understood that both initial conditions and baryonic physics related to star formation and feedback must play an important role . reproducing the @xmath0 zero point",
    "has also been a long standing problem for cdm based galaxy formation models . in particular",
    "no model has been able to simultaneously match the luminosity function and @xmath0 zero point using standard @xmath2 parameters ( cole et  al .  2000 ;",
    "benson et  al .",
    "2003 ; yang , mo , & van den bosch 2003 ) .",
    "this problem can be traced to the high values of @xmath17 expected for @xmath2 halos once the effects of the baryons , such as adiabatic contraction ( blumenthal et  al .",
    "1986 ) , are taken into account .",
    "all solutions to this problem require a change to either the standard cosmological model or the standard picture of galaxy formation .",
    "another potential problem for disk formation models is the formation of large enough disks .",
    "the relative fragility of disk galaxies and the strongly ordered motion of their stars and gas is generally interpreted as evidence for a relatively smooth formation history without violent merger processes .",
    "the sub - sample of dark matter halos without recent major mergers is known to have systematically low spin parameters ( donghia & burkert 2004 ) . however , standard models for the formation of extended rotating disks seem to require high spin parameters in order to reproduce the zero point of the @xmath1 relation .",
    "in addition to the slopes and zero points of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations , additional constraints come from the scatter in these two relations .",
    "in particular , courteau & rix ( 1999 ; hereafter cr99 ) have shown that the residuals of the @xmath0 relation , at fixed @xmath14 , are virtually uncorrelated with the residuals of the @xmath1 relation , at fixed @xmath14 ( see also mcgaugh 2005 ) . this is another way of expressing the fact that the @xmath0 relation is independent of surface brightness ( see courteau et  al .",
    "2006 for details ) , and implies that the size of a disk at given @xmath14 has no relevance to its rotation velocity .",
    "this is a puzzling result to explain , as one would naively expect that a more concentrated disk also results in a higher rotation velocity .",
    "cr99 , therefore , interpreted the weak residual correlation as indicating that , _ on average _ , high surface brightness ( hsb ) disks are sub - maximal , so that the disk only contributes mildly to the observed rotation velocity .",
    "if confirmed this puts constraints on the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath18 , and thus on the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "fa00 , on the other hand , claim that the weak residual correlation owes to the surface density dependence of star formation , such that at a given baryonic mass , lower surface density galaxies have lower stellar masses , and hence lower luminosities , which compensate for the somewhat lower rotation velocities .",
    "however , in their model both the highest and lowest surface brightness galaxies lie above the mean @xmath0 relation , contrary to observations , and their models do not reproduce the zero point of the @xmath0 relation or the amount of scatter in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations .",
    "although various studies have attempted to explain the origin of the @xmath0 or the @xmath1 relation , the true challenge lies in finding a self - consistent model of disk formation that can match both relations as well as the galaxy luminosity function _",
    "simultaneously_. finding such a model is a non - trivial task , as all current models fail to do so . in this paper",
    "we examine the parameter space of such models within the standard @xmath2 cosmology .",
    "we simultaneously match the slopes , zero points and residuals of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations .",
    "we also investigate what each of these models predict for the mean @xmath17 . in order to be able to reproduce the observed abundances of disk galaxies",
    ", this ratio needs to be relatively low @xmath19 .",
    "we show that this restriction severely limits the allowable parameter space , favoring a model with low spin parameter @xmath4 , low galaxy mass fraction @xmath5 , and with halo expansion rather than halo contraction .",
    "the key ingredients of our model are as follows :    1 .",
    "disk galaxies form in spherical dark - matter halos whose properties are drawn from n - body simulations of the standard @xmath2 cosmology .",
    "in particular , their density profiles have an nfw form with a concentration parameter @xmath3 that declines systematically with mass .",
    "the baryons form an exponential disk in centrifugal equilibrium , which is specified by a mass fraction @xmath5 and a spin parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the galaxy mass fraction is treated as a free parameter with a mean @xmath20 .",
    "positive values of @xmath21 are expected from feedback effects .",
    "4 .   a bulge is included based on a self - regulating mechanism that ensures disk stability .",
    "the interaction between the baryons and the dark matter halo is modeled with a generalized adiabatic contraction model which also allows for halo expansion .",
    "stars form in the disk once above a threshold surface density .",
    "the i - band stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath22 increases with luminosity as constrained by observations .",
    "the model parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath22 are assumed to be independent log - normal random variables .",
    "the data and models are introduced in  [ sec : data ] and  [ sec : models ] , respectively . in  [ sec : ml ] we outline the conversion between stellar mass and luminosity ; in  [ sec : sampling ] we detail the computation of our model scaling relations . in  [ sec : convert ] we discuss how to construct models that match the slopes , zero points , scatter and residual correlation . in ",
    "[ sec : lowspin ] we explore the model parameter space , and advocate a revised model for disk formation .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we compare our models with the large data set of @xmath23 local disk galaxies compiled by courteau et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) . for each of these galaxies a rotation velocity @xmath12 , a luminosity @xmath14 ,",
    "a disk scale length @xmath13 , and a central surface brightness of the disk @xmath24 , are available .",
    "the data set is compiled from three independent samples : mathewson , ford , & buchhorn 1992 ( hereafter , mat ) ; courteau et  al .",
    "2000 ( hereafter , shellflow ) ; and dale et  al .  1999 ( hereafter , scii ) .",
    "all galaxy luminosities are measured in the @xmath25-band , and correspond to _ total _ luminosities ( i.e. , disk plus bulge ) .",
    "in addition , for a significant sub - sample we also have optical colors available , which we use to estimate stellar mass - to - light ratios ( see  [ sec : ml ] below ) .",
    "disk scale lengths and surface brightnesses are determined from the @xmath25-band photometry . in",
    "what follows , whenever we refer to surface brightness we mean the _ central _ surface brightness , @xmath26 , of the exponential disk fitted to the data .    due to the complications involved with interpreting  line widths",
    ", we only use rotation velocities derived from resolved hh@xmath27 rotation curves .",
    "this reduces the full sample by @xmath28 galaxies . for the mat and shellflow samples",
    "the rotation curves are fitted with a parametric function ( courteau 1997 ) which is then evaluated at 2.2 disk scale lengths . for the scii sample",
    "the velocities are measured at the optical radius ( equivalent to 3.2 scale lengths for an exponential disk ) .                  in order to homogenize these data samples as much as possible ,",
    "we have derived the inclination and cosmological corrections to the velocities , luminosities and scale lengths in a uniform way , as described below .",
    "the observed rotation velocities , @xmath29 , are corrected for inclination and cosmological broadening using @xmath30 the inclination , @xmath31 , is computed using @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the minor - to - major axis ratio , and @xmath34 is the intrinsic thickness of the disk .",
    "we assume @xmath35 , and set @xmath36 if @xmath37 .",

    "the external ( galactic ) extinction is computed using the dust maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) , while the k - corrections are computed using the line width dependent formalism of willick et  al .",

    "following giovanelli et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) we assume an uncertainty of 15% in @xmath55 , @xmath45 , @xmath40 , and @xmath56 , and propagate the errors .",
    "not including distance uncertainties , the average errors on the observables are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "we now use the data described above to investigate the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations of disk galaxies . despite the fact that our sample consists of subsamples that use slightly different techniques or definitions for the scale lengths and rotation velocities , we find that , with the uniform inclination and extinction corrections described above , each subsample yields @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations that are consistent with each other ( see courteau et  al .",
    "2006 for details ) .",
    "we therefore combine the three subsamples to a single sample of @xmath60 galaxies .",

    "note that these @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations , which are in excellent agreement with our mean scaling relations , were used by mmw and fa00 as model constraints .",
    "the red lines in fig .  [ fig : vlr_all_lit ] show the @xmath61 relations of pizagno et  al .",
    "the latter study is based on a sample of 81 disk dominated ( b / d < 0.11 ) galaxies , with luminosities in the sloan @xmath31-band , disk scale lengths measured with bulge - to - disk decompositions , and velocities measured at 2.2 disk scale lengths from hh@xmath27 rotation curves .",
    "we convert from @xmath76 to @xmath77 using @xmath78 , assuming @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ( courteau et  al .",
    "note that the slope of the @xmath0 relation of pizagno et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) is somewhat steeper than ours , while their @xmath1 relation is offset from ours towards larger disk scale lengths .",
    "these differences may be due to a combination of their relatively small sample size ( 81 galaxies ) , their bulge - to - disk ratio selection criteria , and different inclination corrections .",
    "these differences do not significant impact on our main conclusions , as we discuss in appendix  [ sec : piz05 ]",
    "in the standard picture of disk formation ( e.g. , fall & efstathiou 1980 ) , disks form inside virialized dark matter halos through the cooling of the baryonic material .",
    "our models are based on this standard picture , and closely follow mmw , but with some additional ingredients . in particular , we include a model for the formation of bulges , we use a prescription for star formation which separates the disk into gaseous and stellar components , we use an improved and generalized description for adiabatic contraction , and we use empirical relations to convert our models to observable quantities for direct comparison with the data described above .",
    "all these model ingredients are discussed in more detail below .",
    "although we refer to our models as ` disk formation models ' they are completely ` static ' ( i.e. , the model is not actually evolved ) . for a given specific angular momentum of the baryonic material out of which the disk forms and a given potential due to the dark matter ,",
    "the structural properties of the resulting disk are computed assuming ( i ) that disks are exponential , and ( ii ) that the specific angular momentum of the baryonic material is conserved .",
    "alternatively , one could in principle consider more ` dynamic ' models , that follow the actual formation of the disk galaxies starting at high redshifts ( e.g. , firmani & avila - reese 2000 ; avila - reese & firmani 2000 ; van den bosch 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "however , as long as the formation of the disk is sufficiently quiescent , the final structure of the disk should be independent of its actual formation history : the structural properties of the final disk are basically just governed by the principle of dynamical , centrifugal equilibrium . in a more dynamic approach , one can actually model the star formation history of the disk , which is not possible with our static model .",
    "however , the star formation history mainly governs the final mass - to - light ratio of the stars , which we set using empirical relations .",
    "the models described here should thus be applicable independent of the detailed formation history as long as the two assumptions mentioned above are satisfied .    unless stated otherwise we adopt a @xmath2 cosmology with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and with a scale - invariant initial power spectrum with a normalization @xmath85 .",
    "the baryonic mass fraction of this cosmology @xmath86 .",
    "we model dark matter halos as spheres with a nfw density distribution @xmath87 ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) where @xmath88 is a characteristic radius at which the logarithmic slope of the density distribution @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "the overall shape of the density distribution can be characterized by the so - called concentration parameter @xmath91 . here",
    "@xmath92 is the virial radius , which is defined as the radius inside of which the average halo density is @xmath93 times the critical density for closure . for the @xmath2 cosmology adopted here @xmath94 ( bryan & norman 1998 ) .",
    "in addition to the virial radius @xmath92 we also define the virial velocity @xmath9 as the circular velocity at the virial radius , i.e. , @xmath95 , with @xmath96 the gravitational constant .    the total angular momentum of a halo , @xmath97 , is commonly expressed in terms of the dimensionless spin parameter : @xmath98 here @xmath99 is the halo s energy , and @xmath100 measures the deviation of @xmath99 from that of a singular isothermal sphere with the same mass , and is given by @xmath101 ^ 2}\\ ] ] ( see mmw ) .",
    "we assume that the galaxy that forms consists of a bulge and a disk .",
    "our algorithm to ascribe a bulge - to - disk ratio is discussed at the end of this section .",
    "we define the baryonic mass of the total galaxy as @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 the masses of the disk and bulge , respectively , and @xmath105 .",
    "we define the bulge - to - disk mass ratio as @xmath106 so that @xmath107 @xmath108 in addition , we write that the total angular momentum of the baryons out of which the disk plus bulge form is @xmath109 as shown by van den bosch et  al .  ( 2002 ) , the specific angular momentum distribution of the total baryonic mass ( including those baryons in the halo that do not partake in the formation of the disk plus bulge ) is virtually identical to that of the dark matter .",
    "therefore , one also expects that @xmath110 .    as discussed below , we assume that the bulge forms out of disk instabilities .",
    "let @xmath111 indicate the original angular momentum of the baryonic material out of which the bulge forms .",
    "we assume , however , that the bulge formation process transfers this angular momentum to the disk plus the halo , so that the final angular momentum of the bulge is zero .",
    "indeed , such an angular momentum transfer is observed in numerical simulations ( e.g. , hohl 1971 ; debattista et  al .",
    "if we define @xmath112 as the fraction of @xmath113 that is transferred to the disk , we obtain that the final angular momentum of the disk is equal to @xmath114 { \\ifmmode j_{\\rm vir } \\else $ j_{\\rm vir}$ \\fi}\\ ] ] the _ specific _ angular momentum of the final disk is therefore @xmath115 \\left (   { { \\ifmmode j_{\\rm gal } \\else $ j_{\\rm gal}$ \\fi}\\over { \\ifmmode m_{\\rm gal }     \\else $ m_{\\rm gal}$ \\fi } } \\right ) { { \\ifmmode j_{\\rm vir } \\else $ j_{\\rm vir}$ \\fi}\\over { \\ifmmode m_{\\rm   vir } \\else $ m_{\\rm   vir}$ \\fi}}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the parameter @xmath116 which expresses the fraction of the total angular momentum of the material out of which the bulge plus disk forms that has been lost to the halo . for modeling purposes",
    "it is more useful to define the parameter @xmath117 which expresses the ratio of the _ specific _ angular momentum that has been lost to the halo due to bulge formation to the total _",
    "specific _ angular momentum of the material out of which the disk plus bulge have formed .",
    "for example , @xmath118 means that bulge formation does not change the specific angular momentum of the disk .",
    "the extreme @xmath119 occurs when the disk loses mass but not angular momentum during bulge formation .",
    "note that unlike @xmath120 , the parameter @xmath121 can in principle be larger than unity . in practice , however , the bulge is likely to form out of material with relatively low specific angular momentum ( e.g. , norman , sellwood & hassan 1996 ; van den bosch et  al .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of angular momentum that is lost to the halo is expected to be fairly small ( e.g. , weinberg 1985 ; debattista & sellwood 2000 ; valenzuela & klypin 2003 ; oneill & dubinski 2003 ) , so that @xmath112 is expected to be close to unity .    for a disk with a surface density @xmath122 and",
    "a circular velocity @xmath123 the total angular momentum is @xmath124 throughout we assume that the disk that forms has an exponential surface density distribution @xmath125 , so that @xmath126 with @xmath127 ( cf . , mmw ) .",
    "if we combine equations  ( [ spin ] ) , ( [ jdmd ] ) , and  ( [ jdisk ] ) we obtain the following expression for the scale length of the disk : @xmath128 \\ , \\lambda_{\\rm gal } \\ , { \\ifmmode r_{\\rm vir } \\else $ r_{\\rm vir}$ \\fi}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath4 as the effective spin parameter of the material out of which the bulge plus disk form : @xmath129 from equation  ( [ rd ] ) it is evident that bulge formation impacts the final scale length of the disk .",
    "typically , for @xmath130 the disk size will decrease , while @xmath131 causes an increase in @xmath132 .",
    "note that the transition does not occur exactly at @xmath118 , because the presence of a bulge component modifies @xmath133 .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that bulge formation causes an increase in disk scale lengths ( debattista et  al .",
    "2006 ) , suggesting that @xmath134 .",

    "their favored model is equivalent to our model with @xmath135 .",
    "however , given the arguments above , we expect @xmath121 to be smaller than this . in what follows",
    "we adopt a fiducial value of @xmath136 , although none of our results are very sensitive to this particular choice .",
    "note that since the computation of @xmath133 requires knowledge of @xmath132 , this set of equations has to be solved iteratively ( see mmw for details ) .",

    "the density distribution of the bulge is assumed to follow a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile @xmath144 in projection , this is similar to a de vaucouleurs profile ( i.e. , a sersic profile with sersic index @xmath145 ) , with a half light radius , @xmath146 ( hernquist 1990 ) .",

    "the computation of the actual bulge - to - disk ratio for each model galaxy is based on the fact that self - gravitating disks are unstable against global instabilities ( e.g. , bar formation ) .",
    "we follow the approach of van den bosch ( 1998 , 2000 ) and avila - reese & firmani ( 2000 ) and assume that an unstable disk transforms part of its disk material into a bulge component in a self - regulating fashion , such that the final disk is marginally stable .",

    "if disks are not built by smooth , relatively slow , spherical infall , the adiabatic contraction could , in principle , be counter - balanced by a variety of processes .",

    "firstly , it is a clear improvement over the assumption that disks consist of stars only , such as in the standard mmw model .",
    "secondly , as shown by van den bosch ( 2000 , 2001 ) , this simple model ( i ) matches the gas mass fractions of disk galaxies as function of their surface brightness and luminosity , and ( ii ) naturally leads to gas disks that are more extended than stellar disks . finally ,",
    "more detailed , ` dynamic ' models for disk formation , which model the actual star formation rate using realistic , empirically motivated , prescriptions , show that the typical star formation time scale is short compared to the time scale on which the disk accretes new gas . consequently",

    "as we will see later , the inclusion of a star formation threshold density proves a crucial ingredient in solving two problems of the standard mmw model .      in order to compare our models with observations ,",

    "the solid black dot shows the minimum of the @xmath388 offset for each model within our grid , so it is not necessarily a global minimum .",

    "lines of constant @xmath390 are approximately @xmath391 . in these models @xmath389 is equivalent to central surface brightness , so that galaxies with low surface brightness disks have low @xmath363 , and vice versa for high surface brightness disks .",
    "the fifth column from the left shows the ratio of @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the dependence of this ratio on @xmath5 and @xmath4 is more complicated than @xmath363 but follows the same trend that models with higher @xmath5 and lower @xmath4 have higher @xmath10 .",

    "matching the @xmath0 zero point for these values of @xmath386 and @xmath191 requires @xmath399 .",
    "however , this clearly results in disks that are too large .",
    "this demonstrates that this ` standard ' model is unable to simultaneously match the @xmath0 and @xmath1 zero points for realistic @xmath22 .",
    "the second row shows a model with @xmath400 , i.e. with halo concentrations that are 50% lower than for the @xmath2 concordance cosmology . although one can now match the @xmath0 zero point with smaller , more realistic @xmath4 , a simultaneous match to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 zero points still requires relatively high @xmath5",
    "this is essentially model  ii . as shown in the third row of fig.[fig : chi5 ] , very similar results are obtained for models with standard halo concentrations ( @xmath401 ) but without adiabatic contraction ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "model  iii is basically an example of such a model , which indeed yields results that are very similar to those of model  ii .    in the fourth row",
    "we consider an even more unorthodox model ; in addition to ` turning off ' adiabatic contraction ( @xmath167 ) , we also set the halo concentrations to be 50% lower than expected in the @xmath2 concordance cosmology ( @xmath400 ) .",
    "for these parameters , the @xmath0 zero point can be matched for a very wide range of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , there are two branches in @xmath5-@xmath4 space that match the @xmath0 zero point , corresponding to high and low surface brightness disks . this branching is also visible from the curvature of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 lines in the upper right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : vlr - mcl8 ] . in order to also match the @xmath1 relation the model needs to fall on the high surface brightness branch , and needs to have values for both @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are much lower than for the previous models .",
    "similar constraints are obtained for a model with halo expansion ( @xmath168 ) but with standard halo concentrations ( @xmath401 ) , shown in the fifth row .",
    "the lower two rows of panels thus indicate that there is a part of parameter space that can match the @xmath0 and @xmath1 zero points equally well as models i - iii , but with a much lower average spin parameter and much lower galaxy mass fractions .",

    "both of these values are much lower than for models i - iii .",
    "note that this model fits the slopes , zero points , scatter and correlation between residuals of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations .",
    "it also predicts a significant correlation between the residuals of the corresponding baryonic scaling relations , in agreement with models i - iii .",
    "the average @xmath366 of this model is even larger than for model  iii ( @xmath406 percent of all galaxies have @xmath407 ) , indicating that a larger fraction of galaxies is baryon dominated within @xmath180 disk scale lengths .    finally , the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mv6 ] plots @xmath10 as function of the galaxy @xmath25-band luminosity .",
    "this model predicts an average @xmath10 of @xmath19 , significantly lower than for models i - iii .",
    "thus , @xmath8 in model  iv is comparable to @xmath206 , the maximum circular velocity of a nfw halo without adiabatic contraction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vvir ] ) .",
    "this is also evident from the panels in the fifth column of fig.[fig : chi5 ] , which shows contours of constant @xmath10 : note that the models in the upper three rows that simultaneously match the @xmath0 and @xmath1 zero points , indicated by a solid dot , all predict relatively high values of @xmath10 with a mean of @xmath408 .",
    "however , the models in the lower two rows , which can simultaneously fit the @xmath0 and @xmath1 zero points with low @xmath4 and @xmath5 , predict much lower values of @xmath10 with a mean of @xmath409 .          we have shown that one can construct models that match the slopes , zero points and residual correlations of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations , and which predict relatively low values for @xmath10 .",
    "this has an important implication : all semi - analytic models that are able to match the luminosity function ( lf ) require @xmath410 in order to simultaneously match the @xmath0 zero point ( e.g. , somerville & primack 1999 ; cole et  al .  2000 ;",

    "model iv , however , which is based on halo expansion , predicts ratios of @xmath10 that clearly allow for a simultaneous fit to the lf . in more general terms , as can be seen from the fifth row of panels in fig.[fig : chi5 ] , low values of @xmath10 require average values for @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are much lower than the standard values normally adopted . in the standard model ( i.e. , @xmath165 , @xmath401 ) , however , such low values for @xmath4 and @xmath5 result in a @xmath0 zero - point that is in violent disagreement with the data",
    ". the only models for which a low @xmath10 simultaneously allows a fit to both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 zero points are those in the lower two rows : either adiabatic contraction does not occur ( @xmath167 ) and halo concentrations are a factor two smaller than predicted for a @xmath2 concordance cosmology , or halos actually expand during disk formation ( with @xmath411 ) , in which case their original ( before expansion ) concentrations can be as predicted . of course , one can also construct models with intermediate values of @xmath191 and @xmath386 .",
    "for a cosmology with @xmath412 as advocated by the third year wmap results ( spergel et  al .",
    "2006 ) @xmath413 which requires @xmath414 .",
    "this obviously raises the question whether halo expansion during disk formation is a realistic option from a physical point of view .",
    "it is certainly inconsistent with the standard picture , in which disks form out of cooling flows that preserve their specific angular momentum ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ; mmw ; dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ) . since the time scale for new gas to reach the disk is never shorter than the free fall time , the formation of the resulting disk will cause a contraction of the dark matter halo that is close to adiabatic . in order to avoid contraction",
    ", one needs to abandon the idea that gas reaches the disk via a ( relatively smooth ) cooling flow .",
    "rather , the disk material has to assemble out of several ( massive ) clumps , which reach the center of the halo by dynamical friction .",
    "after all , dynamical friction transfers the potential energy and orbital angular momentum of the clumps to the dark matter particles , which consequently move to larger radii ( e.g. , el - zant , shlosman & hoffman 2001 ; ma & boylan - kolchin 2004 ; mo & mao 2004 ; tonini , lapi & salucci 2006 ) .",
    "the same mechanism has also been proposed as an explanation for the large , constant density cores observed in some clusters of galaxies ( el - zant et  al .",
    "2004 ; zappacosta et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "in addition to providing a scenario for disk formation that is consistent with the galaxy luminosity function , halo expansion may also help to alleviate a long - standing problem with observed rotation curves , which are claimed to be inconsistent with steeply cusped nfw profiles ( e.g. , dutton et  al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) and with the observed pattern speeds of bars ( e.g. , debattista & sellwood 2000 , weiner et  al .",
    "although we defer a detailed discussion on the rotation curve shapes of our various models to a forthcoming paper , we have verified that in all models discussed here the galaxies have realistic ( i.e. , flat ) rotation curves",
    ".    additional ` support ' for model  iv comes from various estimates of the baryonic mass fractions of disk galaxies . as is evident from fig.[fig : chi5 ] , models with halo expansion that match the @xmath0 and @xmath1 zero points predict much lower values for @xmath4 and @xmath5 than the standard models with adiabatic contraction .",
    "as we have argued above , there are several reasons for expecting @xmath415 .",
    "support for low galaxy mass fractions comes from various sources , including the conditional luminosity function formalism ( yang et  al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ; cooray 2005 ) and galaxy - galaxy lensing ( guzik & seljak 2002 ; hoekstra et  al .",
    "in particular , in one of the largest galaxy - galaxy lensing studies to date , mandelbaum et  al .",

    "being @xmath419 ) , in good agreement with the value of @xmath271 for our model  iv .",
    "the main potential problem for the ` expansion - scenario ' proposed here is that it is not clear whether the merger between various clumps can produce a realistic disk galaxy .",
    "although high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of disk formation in a cosmological framework have recently suggested that realistic disk galaxies may form out of merging progenitors ( e.g. , robertson et  al .",
    "2006 ) , more work is clearly needed to investigate such a formation scenario in detail .    to summarize ,",
    "if one is willing to abandon the idea that disk formation involves adiabatic contraction of the corresponding dark matter halo , one can construct disk formation models that simultaneously match the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations using standard cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , these model predict low baryonic mass fractions , in better agreement with the data , predict low spin parameters , consistent with a picture in which disks form preferentially in halos with quiescent merger histories , and , most importantly , yield characteristic values for @xmath10 that suggest that one may be able to simultaneously fit the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "we have used the slopes , zero - points , and residuals of the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations to place constraints on the standard @xmath2 -based model for the formation of disk galaxies .",
    "our models consider exponential ( baryonic ) disks in centrifugal equilibrium within nfw dark matter halos .",
    "we model the reaction of the dark halo to disk formation in a way which permits it to range from the standard adiabatic contraction to an expansion of a similar magnitude .",
    "the disk stars - to - gas ratio is determined by a threshold surface density for star formation . a bulge is included based on a self - regulating mechanism that ensures disk stability .",
    "the disk properties are converted into observables using an empirically determined , luminosity - dependent , stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we construct samples of model galaxies including intrinsic scatter in halo concentrations , stellar mass - to - light ratios , and galaxy spin parameter .",
    "in addition , we mimic observational errors , and sample the model galaxies so that they reproduce the observed luminosity distribution . for each sample",
    "we construct model @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations which we compare to the data . by demanding the models to _ simultaneously",
    "_ reproduce the slopes , zero points and scatter of the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations , including the correlation between the residuals , we obtain the following conclusions :    * since the stellar mass - to - light ratio increases with increasing luminosity , the slopes of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations deviate from the basic halo virial relation @xmath420 .",
    "the observed @xmath0 slope is reproduced when the gas - to - stellar mass ratio is properly decreasing with mass .",
    "this is naturally achieved by a surface - density threshold for star formation .",
    "the observed @xmath1 slope requires that the disk mass fraction is properly increasing with mass , in agreement with generic predictions of supernova feedback ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; dekel & woo 2003 ) . * the standard model , assuming adiabatic contraction and @xmath2 halo concentrations , can match the @xmath0 zero point only with an unrealistically top - heavy imf . even in this case , the predicted ratio of @xmath10 is too high for a match of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "* models with a realistic imf and adiabatic contraction require halo concentrations that are a factor two smaller than predicted , which is marginally consistent with the wmap constraints on the cosmological parameters . models with realistic imfs and standard halo concentrations can simultaneously match the @xmath0 and @xmath1 zero points only if adiabatic contraction does not occur . in both of these cases",
    "the predicted ratio of @xmath10 is too high for matching the luminosity function . *",
    "if disk formation causes dark - matter halos to expand rather than contract , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations can be reproduced with standard halo concentrations combined with low values of galaxy spin parameter and mass fraction .",
    "the low average spin parameter is consistent with the picture in which disks survive in halos that have not experienced recent major mergers ( donghia & burkert 2004 ) .",
    "the low baryon fraction is consistent with galaxy - galaxy lensing studies ( mandelbaum et  al .",
    "this model predicts that @xmath421 , consistent with what is required to fit the luminosity function . *",
    "the scatter in the @xmath0 relation has roughly equal contributions from scatter in @xmath3 , in @xmath22 and from observational errors . to match the amount of scatter observed , we require that @xmath422",
    "this is smaller than the prediction for the full set of dark - matter halos , @xmath423 ( bullock et  al .",
    "2001a ) , but consistent with the sub - sample of halos without recent major mergers ( wechsler et  al .  2002 ) . *",
    "the @xmath1 scatter is dominated by scatter in the spin parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the observed @xmath1 scatter requires that @xmath424 , about half the value predicted for @xmath2 halos .",
    "this is again consistent with the picture in which disks survive in halos with a quiet merger history .",
    "this picture also implies that the _ average _ spin parameter is low .",
    "a simultaneous match of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations with such a low @xmath318 requires that the baryonic mass fraction is also low .",
    "this , in turn , strongly favors a model with expansion rather than adiabatic contraction . *",
    "the observed residuals of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations show only a weak anti - correlation .",
    "we have shown that this can partly be attributed to the threshold density for star formation , which causes the spread in @xmath4 to scatter galaxies along the @xmath0 relation ( see also fa00 ) .",
    "reproducing the shallow slope @xmath373 of the residual correlation is possible only when there is scatter in @xmath22 and when the scatter in @xmath3 is relatively low , @xmath425 .",
    "* unlike the earlier suggestion by courteau & rix ( 1999 ) , we find that @xmath373 does not provide a strong constraint on the baryon fraction in the inner halo .",
    "the relation between @xmath373 and @xmath363 depends on several model ingredients such as the degree of halo contraction or expansion , the threshold density for star formation , and the sensitivity of @xmath373 to the scatter in the different variables .",
    "in addition , in all our models there is a large scatter in @xmath366 which is strongly correlated with surface brightness .",
    "this correlation results in the highest surface brightness galaxies being baryon within 2.2 disk scale lengths , while at the same time allowing the lowest surface brightness galaxies to be dark matter dominated as is generally accepted . *",
    "although observations have shown that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 residuals are uncorrelated , our models robustly predict that the residuals of the _ baryonic _ @xmath351 and @xmath352 relations are strongly anti - correlated .",
    "based on these results we conclude that the standard model , which includes standard adiabatic contraction , standard halo concentration parameters and a standard imf , does not allow a simultaneous match to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations .",
    "this is a modification of earlier conclusions , e.g. , by mmw and pizagno et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which owes to our more realistic modeling ( see appendix  [ sec : piz05 ] ) .",
    "although a proper fit can be obtained if the halo concentrations are significantly lower , or if adiabatic contraction does not occur , these models predict high values of @xmath10 which prevent a match with the galaxy luminosity function . they also predict high baryonic mass fractions in conflict with results from galaxy - galaxy lensing .",
    "to circumvent these problems , we advocate a model in which the dark matter halo responds by expansion rather than by contraction , to the formation of the disk .",
    "this model ( i ) predicts values for @xmath10 that allow a simultaneous fit to the lf ( ii ) is consistent with disks forming predominantly in dark matter halos that have not experienced a recent major merger , ( iii ) predicts low baryonic mass fractions , in agreement with a wide range of observations , and ( iv ) predicts dark matter halos that are less centrally concentrated , in better agreement with rotation curve shapes and bar pattern speeds .",
    "the idea of an expanding dark matter halo is counter to the standard model for disk formation , in which disks form out of relatively smooth cooling flows that conserve their specific angular momentum .",
    "rather , the expansion scenario requires that disks form out of merging clumps , which transfer energy and angular momentum to the dark matter via dynamical friction and three body interactions .",
    "such a scenario naturally arises if disks form out of clumpy , cold accretion flows ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ; keres et  al .  2005 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ) . while the formation of realistic disk galaxies out of such clumpy streams is yet to be investigated in detail , preliminary hints are provided by hydrodynamical simulations which have demonstrated that disks can originate from merging gaseous progenitors ( e.g. , robertson et  al .",

    "( 2004 ) matches the @xmath351 and @xmath352 data reasonably well .",
    "this is in disagreement with our statement that the mmw model is unable to reproduce the slopes of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations (  [ sec : slopes ] ) and with our claim that models with adiabatic contraction , standard halo concentrations , and standard imfs require @xmath399 in order to match the @xmath0 zero point ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chi5 ] ) .",
    "below we address these and other differences between our results and those of p05 .",
    "* we first note that unlike our @xmath0 relation and those of giovanelli et  al .",
    "1997 , the @xmath351 and @xmath0 relations of p05 do not follow a single power - law .",
    "there is a significant deviation below @xmath432 in both their @xmath351 and @xmath0 relations . in what follows we focus on their galaxies with @xmath433 .",
    "* p05 assume @xmath434 and that the disk is 100% stars , thus their @xmath351 relation has a slope of @xmath291 , in agreement with their data .",
    "however , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : slopes ] , the expected variation of @xmath3 and the gas - to - stellar mass ratio with @xmath257 both result in significantly shallower @xmath351 slopes .",
    "thus either @xmath3 and the gas - to - stellar mass ratio do not depend significantly on @xmath257 , or their data significantly over - estimates the @xmath351 slope . * as can clearly be seen in fig .  4 of p05 , their model with @xmath435 and @xmath436 does not match the @xmath351 zero point of the data .",
    "their model with @xmath437 and @xmath438 provides a better match , but predicts a much stronger dependence of @xmath351 scatter on @xmath269 , and hence disk size .",
    "their models assume pure stellar disks . including reasonable gas - to - stellar mass ratios",
    "requires even larger values of @xmath338 and @xmath269 to match the @xmath351 zero point which are now consistent with our results ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chi5 ] ) .",
    "* p05 do not construct a self consistent model for the @xmath351 and @xmath352 relations and their scatter .",
    "we have verified that pure disk models ( e.g. mmw ) which simultaneously match the @xmath351 and @xmath352 relations _ always _ predict a significant correlation between @xmath351 and @xmath352 residuals .",
    "p05 speculated that a weak correlation between size and @xmath351 residual could be washed out by other sources that contribute to the @xmath351 scatter .",
    "however the only significant sources to the @xmath351 scatter are @xmath3 and observational errors .",
    "we have found that while observational errors do reduce the strength of the residual correlation the effect is small .",
    "by contrast scatter in @xmath3 results in a significantly stronger negative correlation between the residuals .",
    "thus rather than washing out the correlation between size and @xmath351 residual , the expected scatter in @xmath3 and observational errors will result in a stronger correlation . *",
    "the @xmath1 relation of p05 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vlr_all_lit ] , has a significantly higher zero point normalization than ours .",
    "the most likely sources of this difference are their bulge - to - disk ratio selection criteria , or their lack of inclination corrections to the disk sizes .",
    "their larger disk sizes require a @xmath439 larger spin parameter , @xmath4 , assuming all the other model parameters are kept fixed .",
    "larger disks , at a given disk mass , contribute less to @xmath8 , and result in less halo contraction .",
    "this makes it easier to fit the @xmath0 zero point and also weakens the correlation between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 residuals .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi5 ] even a 50% increase in the @xmath1 zero point ( corresponding to about 1@xmath241 of the observational scatter ) would not significantly change any of our conclusions regarding a simultaneous match",
    "the of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 zero points and a low ratio of @xmath10 .    in summary , although there are differences in the data samples used by p05 and ourselves , both our and the p05 data require large @xmath399 in order to match the @xmath0 zero point .",
    "not only is such a high value of @xmath4 unrealistic , such a high @xmath5 is also inconsistent with galaxy - galaxy lensing constraints . furthermore the mmw model adopted by p05 is unable to reproduce the slope or the surface brightness independence of the @xmath0 relation , due to the overly simplistic assumption that galaxy disks are 100% stars .",
    "we have assumed that the scatter in the model parameters are uncorrelated . for completeness , we here present a brief discussion on how correlations between model parameters might affect our results .    * @xmath269-@xmath3 anti - correlation : bullock et  al .",
    "( 2001b ) found no correlation between @xmath269 and @xmath3 above the weak correlation expected from the definition of @xmath269 .",
    "however , bailin et  al .",
    "( 2005a ) claim a correlation , but this is likely due to their inclusion of unrelaxed halos ( macci et  al .",
    "suppose halos with larger @xmath269 have lower @xmath3 ; looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : vlr - mcl8 ] we see that this would result in larger scatter in both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 relations , and by the same reasoning a stronger residual correlation .",
    "* @xmath440 correlation : at a fixed halo mass , lower @xmath3 halos assemble later ; in addition lower @xmath3 halos result in lower surface density disks .",
    "thus , everything else being equal , we expect that at a fixed halo mass , lower @xmath3 halos to contain galaxies with younger ( bluer ) stellar populations than halos with larger @xmath3 .",
    "since younger populations correspond to lower stellar mass - to - light ratios , we thus expect a positive correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath22 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : vlr - mcl8 ] we see that such a correlation increases the overall @xmath0 scatter .",
    "it will also decrease the @xmath1 scatter , but since @xmath22 and @xmath3 contribute relatively little to the @xmath1 scatter , this reduction is unlikely to be significant . *",
    "@xmath441 correlation : since mass is more centrally concentrated than specific angular momentum one generally expects that @xmath442 if disk galaxies form inside out .",
    "this implies that a smaller @xmath5 implies a smaller @xmath4 .",
    "if these two parameters are indeed positively correlated , the overall scatter in the @xmath1 relation is predicted to be smaller , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : vlr - mcl8 ] .",
    "however , recall (  4.1 & 4.3 ) that it is the correlation between the gas - to - stellar mass ratio and @xmath4 , through a critical star formation threshold density , that is essential in reproducing the slope of the @xmath0 relation and the surface brightness independence of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "any models that introduce a correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 will likely erase these successes . * @xmath443 anti - correlation : at a fixed baryonic mass lower @xmath4 results in higher surface density disks .",
    "since empirically the star formation efficiency is proportional to the surface density of the stars ( kennicutt 1998 ) , we thus expect higher surface density systems to have older stellar populations , in agreement with the data ( kauffmann et  al .",
    "such an anti - correlation would tend to remove any color dependence of the @xmath1 relation and hence reduce its scatter ( bell et  al .",
    "however , it would also increase the surface brightness dependence of the @xmath0 relation .    in summary",
    ", there are several plausible correlations between model parameters .",
    "although three of these have the potential to explain why the @xmath1 scatter is smaller than predicted , we do not expect that these correlations can reconcile the full amount of scatter in @xmath269 expected from simulations with the observed scatter in the @xmath1 relation .",
    "furthermore , each of these correlations will increase the strength of the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 residuals ( or equivalently the strength of the surface brightness dependence of the @xmath0 relation ) . thus to reproduce the weakly correlated residuals we would require even less scatter in @xmath3 than the @xmath444 we currently adopt .",
    "this reinforces the conclusion that disk galaxies form in a subset of halos .",
    "cr99 argued that the weak correlation between the residuals of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations , @xmath445 , implies disks of high surface brightness galaxies should have , _ on average _ @xmath446 . cr99",
    "arrive at this result by computing @xmath447 for models consisting of exponential disks in nfw halos with adiabatic contraction .",
    "they found that in these models v_2.2",
    "/ r_d @xmath448 correlates with @xmath374 ( the ratio of the circular velocity of the disk to the total circular velocity , at 2.2 disk scale lengths ) , such that galaxies with higher @xmath374 have more negative @xmath449 , with the limiting case of @xmath450 for a pure exponential disk .",
    "thus by assuming that @xmath449 is equivalent to the observed slope of the residual correlation @xmath373 , they concluded that @xmath375 .",
    "this would suggest more dm than baryons within 2.2 disk scale lengths , but not that the baryon contribution is insignificant .",
    "if the baryons were insignificant then the cr99 model would predict @xmath451 .",
    "however , as outlined below , several of the assumptions made in cr99 are not true in general .",
    "* cr99 assumed that halos contract adiabatically to the formation of the disk . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cr99_c10 ] , which should be compared with fig .  9 of cr99 , we repeat the cr99 analysis for halos with and without adiabatic contraction .",
    "note that cr99 used @xmath434 and that @xmath452 , for ease of comparison we also adopt their definition here .",
    "we see that turning off adiabatic contraction increases @xmath374 by about @xmath453 at a fixed @xmath449 .",
    "* cr99 assumed that bulge formation does not affect the scale length of the disk .",
    "we have shown that in models where the specific angular momentum of the disk increases due to bulge formation ( e.g. @xmath136 ) the residual correlation is weakened .",
    "* cr99 assumed that the contribution of the gas to the disk is negligible .",
    "while this is true for the highest surface brightness galaxies , moderate surface brightness galaxies contain more gas .",
    "we have shown ( see  [ sec : rescorr ] ) that the correlation between the gas - to - stellar mass ratio and disk surface density significantly reduces the strength of the residual correlations .",
    "* cr99 underplayed the effect of scatter in halo concentration @xmath3 and stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath18 .",
    "[ fig : dvlr3 ] shows that scatter in these parameters can result in significantly different residual correlation slopes . scatter in @xmath3 results in a more negative correlation while scatter in @xmath22 results in a more positive correlation . for realistic amounts of scatter in both @xmath3 and @xmath22",
    "the residual correlation is weakened .",
    "* cr99 assumed that @xmath454 .",
    "in general this is not true , because @xmath373 is a global quantity while @xmath449 is a local quantity .",
    "more specifically @xmath373 is the slope of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 residuals for a sample of galaxies , while @xmath449 is the slope of the change in @xmath12 due to change in @xmath13 , at fixed disk mass , for a single galaxy .",
    "thus we conclude that the @xmath0-@xmath1 residuals can not be used to place model independent constraints on the baryonic fraction of disk galaxies .",
    "however , this does not diminish their importance as a constraint for galaxy formation models ."
