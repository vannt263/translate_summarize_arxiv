    "neutrino oscillation experiments have demonstrated that neutrinos are massive and there is leptonic flavour violation in their propagation @xcite ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "current data can be explained assuming that the three known neutrinos ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) are linear quantum superposition of three massive states @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) with masses @xmath5 , connected by a consequently , a leptonic mixing matrix which can be parametrized as @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the phases @xmath9 are only non - zero if neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "if one chooses the convention where the angles @xmath10 are taken to lie in the first quadrant , @xmath11 $ ] , and the cp phases @xmath12 $ ] , then @xmath13 by convention , and @xmath14 can be positive or negative .",
    "it is customary to refer to the first option as normal ordering ( no ) , and to the second one as inverted ordering ( io ) .    at present , the global analysis of neutrino oscillation data yields the three - sigma ranges for the mixing angles @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17@xcite , as well as for the mass differences @xmath18 and @xmath19 , but gives no information on the majorana phases nor on the dirac or majorana nature of the neutrino .",
    "also , neutrino oscillation experiments do not provide a measurement of the absolute neutrino masses , but only of their differences . also , at present , oscillation experiments have not provided information on the mass ordering .",
    "the determination of the ordering and the cp violating phase @xmath20 is the main goal of ongoing long baseline ( lbl ) oscillation experiments @xcite which are sensitive to those in some part of the parameter space .",
    "definite knowledge is better guaranteed in future projects @xcite .",
    "concerning the determination of the absolute mass scale in laboratory experiments , the standard approach is the search for the distortion of the end point of the electron spectrum in tritium beta decay .",
    "currently , the most precise experiments @xcite have given no indication in favour of distortion setting an upper limit @xmath21^{1/2 } < 2.2\\,\\text{ev } \\ ; .\\ ] ] the ongoing katrin experiment @xcite , is expected to achieve an estimated sensitivity limit : @xmath22ev .",
    "the most precise probe of the nature of the neutrino is the search of neutrino - less double beta decay ( @xmath23 ) for verification of lepton number violation which is related to neutrino majorana masses .",
    "so far , this decay has not been observed and the strongest bounds arise from experiments using @xmath24ge @xcite , @xmath25xe @xcite , and @xmath26te @xcite . for the case in which the only effective lepton number violation at low energies is induced by the majorana mass term for the neutrinos ,",
    "the rate of @xmath23 decay is proportional to the effective majorana mass of @xmath0 , and the experimental bounds on the corresponding lifetimes can be translated in constraints on the combination @xmath27 which , in addition to the masses and mixing parameters that affect the tritium beta decay spectrum , it also depends on two combinations of the cp violating phases @xmath20 and @xmath28 .    a potentially revolutionary new way to explore fundamental neutrino physics may come from the field of quantum optics , thanks to recent technological advances .",
    "the key concept behind the intriguing possibility is the small energy difference between the levels in the atom or molecule , which allows for large relative effects associated with the small neutrino masses in the energy released in level transitions .",
    "this , in turn , opens up the possibility of precision neutrino mass spectroscopy , as proposed by ref.@xcite and further explored by @xcite .",
    "the relevant process in this case is the atomic de - excitation via radiative emission of neutrino pairs ( renp ) : @xmath29 .",
    "the rate of this process can be made measurable if macro - coherence of the atomic target can be achieved @xcite .",
    "the proposal is to reach such macro - coherent emission of radiative neutrino pairs via stimulation by irradiation of two trigger lasers of frequencies @xmath30 constrained by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the energy difference of initial and final levels . with this",
    "set - up the energy of the emitted photon in the de - excitation is given by the smaller laser frequency @xmath33 and therefore it can be very precisely known . furthermore , neglecting atomic recoil , energy - momentum conservation implies that each time the energy of the emitted photon decreases below @xmath34 with @xmath35 a new channel ( this is , emission of another pair of massive neutrino species ) is kinematically open .",
    "it is in principle possible to locate these thresholds energies by changing the laser frequency because the laser frequency , and therefore the emitted photon energy , can be known with high precision .",
    "consequently , once the six @xmath34 are measured , the spectrum of the neutrino masses could be fully identified .",
    "it has been argued that this method is ultimately capable of determining the neutrino mass scale , the mass ordering , the dirac vs majorana nature , as well as of measuring the majorana cp violating phases @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for renp is macro - coherence .",
    "if the target is not prepared in a coherent state , the number of events per unit of time depends on the number n of particles of the target .",
    "this would be insufficient from an experimental point of view due to the extremely low cross section of the renp process .",
    "however , if the target is in a coherent state the spectral rate scales with n@xmath36 .",
    "this situation is analogous to the process of superradiance suggested by dicke in 1954 @xcite . according to this",
    ", one can conclude that one of the most critical aspects of this proposal is the development of a target as a robust coherent superposition of states .",
    "the original proposal of the okayama group to generate the required coherent superposition was to induce raman processes by irradiating the target with two different laser fields @xcite . in that case , two photon processes like @xmath37 and @xmath38 are driven populating state @xmath39 and inducing therefore a coherence in the target .",
    "however , it is important to consider that a raman process is a second order process .",
    "this makes complicated to achieve a sufficient degree of control over the experimental parameters for inducing a large coherence in the medium .",
    "for example , miyamoto _",
    "et al _ reported an induced coherence of @xmath406.5@xmath41 in ref.@xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we present an alternative method for inducing large coherence in a target based on adiabatic techniques . more concretely ,",
    "we propose the use of a modified version of coherent population return ( cpr ) , namely double cpr , that turns out to be extremely robust with respect to the experimental parameters , and capable of inducing a coherence close to 100% in the target .",
    "cpr belongs to the group of adiabatic techniques , sometimes also called coherent techniques , used to control the inherent coherent nature of laser - matter interaction .",
    "for example techniques like stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite or electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite have proven to be a very valuable tool to steer population distributions , generate coherent superposition of quantum states , or support spectroscopical investigations .",
    "more concretely , cpr has been recently used to prepare quantum superposition of states maximising therefore the nonlinear response of a medium @xcite . in the following",
    "we will first briefly describe the basis of cpr .",
    "then we will expand our study to the three - state system of interest for renp .",
    "for the sake of an experimental implementation we will also study the robustness as well as the region of adiabaticity of the process with respect to the experimental parameters . finally , we complete our contribution with a brief summary and an outlook .",
    "coherent population return is a coherent technique that produces a non - permanent transient of population of a target excited state . during the interaction with the laser radiation ,",
    "it is possible to achieve a maximum population transfer of 50% . once the interaction ceases , the population returns adiabatically to the ground state",
    ". the original theoretical description of cpr can be found in @xcite . from an experimental point of view",
    ", cpr has been successfully applied to the maintenance of the spectral resolution , i.e. , to suppress power broadening at high laser intensities @xcite , in time - resolved femtosecond pump - probe experiments in molecular systems @xcite , and more recently to induced a robust coherent superposition of states for maximizing the nonlinear properties of a medium @xcite .",
    "let us consider a two - state system with bare states @xmath42 interacting with a laser field whose frequency @xmath43 is detuned from the bohr frequency by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "as customary the description of the population evolution is based on the time - dependent schrdinger equation with an appropriate interacting hamiltonian : @xmath46 in the basis b formed by the states @xmath42 , the hamiltonian that describes this situation after rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the rabi frequency , i.e. , the interaction energy divided by @xmath49 .",
    "explicitly @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the electric dipole transition moment , and @xmath52 the electric field of the laser radiation .",

    ". mathematically the adiabatic condition can be expressed as @xmath70 which turns out into the simple expression @xcite : @xmath71 being t the laser pulse duration .",
    "it is important to notice that the adiabatic region is exclusively determined by the laser detuning with respect to resonance and the duration of the laser pulse ( or equivalently the laser bandwidth ) , being thus independent from the rabi frequency @xmath72 .",
    "this makes cpr an extremely robust technique for its experimental implementation because these parameters are easily controllable in a real experiment .",
    "let us suppose now a situation where at the beginning of the interaction all the population starts in the ground ( lower ) state .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath73 since @xmath74 .",
    "if the evolution is adiabatic , according to the previous analysis the statevector of the system @xmath53 will remain always aligned to the adiabatic state @xmath69 . during the interaction ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath75 , @xmath53 is a coherent superposition of the bare states @xmath76 and @xmath77 defined by eq.[phiminus ] .",
    "once the interaction has ceased , i.e. , @xmath78 , the statevector of the system reads again @xmath79 .",
    "this means that the population transferred to the excited state during the process returns completely to the ground state once the interaction has ceased . as a consequence ,",
    "no population resides permanently in the excited state no matter how large the transient intensity of the laser pump pulse might be ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",

    "the green solid line corresponds to a @xmath83 ratio of 1 , the dashed pink line to @xmath84 , and the dotted blue line to @xmath85.,width=321 ]    it is interesting to notice that during the interaction the population of the excited states reads @xmath86 accordingly , in a situation where during the central part of the laser pulse @xmath87 , the population of the excited state will approach @xmath88 obtaining therefore a perfect coherent superposition between ground and excited states in a robust way . at this point",
    "it is important to clarify the connection between macroscopic and microscopic quantities .",
    "the polarization of the sample ( macroscopic quantity ) is defined as @xmath89 being n the atomic density , @xmath90 the electric dipole operator , and @xmath53 the eigenstate of the system .",
    "taking into account the parity of the operator @xmath90 it is possible to write @xmath91 that is defined as the atomic coherence @xmath92 ( microscopic quantity ) . the coherence , and hence the polarization , will reach a maximum in a situation where the population of ground and excited states are equal , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "in other words , the polarization is maximum when the system is prepared in a perfect coherent superposition of states .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the facts discussed above . it shows the population of ground state @xmath94 and excited state @xmath95 for a fixed detuning @xmath96 and different values of the rabi frequency @xmath97 .",
    "the population of both states tends to the same value for high excitation intensities . in that case , and in the central part of the excitation pulse , the system is prepared in a perfect coherent superposition of the two states .",
    "as it was mentioned in section[introduction ] the system of interest for the research of the neutrino hierarchy by means of laser - matter interaction techniques is a three - level system . in this system with states @xmath98 , being @xmath77 the state of maximum energy , the transitions between @xmath99 and @xmath100 are electric dipole allowed , while the transition @xmath101 is forbidden .",
    "consequently @xmath39 is a metastable state ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "this system is often referred in the literature as a @xmath102-system .",
    "( color online ) level scheme.,width=321 ]      the hamiltonian that describes the situation depicted in fig.[fig2 ] after rwa can be written as : @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the detunings with respect to resonance of the lasers ( pump and stokes ) that couple the @xmath99 and @xmath100 transitions respectively .",
    "this hamiltonian has been extensively studied for the situation of stimulated raman adiabatic passage stirap ( see for example @xcite and references therein )",
    ". in stirap , provided a two - photon resonance condition , i.e. , @xmath106 , and a counterintuitive pulse sequence where the stokes laser interacts with the system before the pump laser , it is possible to achieve a complete and robust transfer of population from @xmath76 to @xmath39 .",
    "however , for obtaining a maximum coherent superposition between @xmath76 and @xmath39 it is necessary to equally distribute the population between both states . as it was explained in section[cpr_section ] , using cpr it is possible to obtain this superposition in a robust way in a two - level system .",
    "thus , in this section we will extend that discussion to the more general situation depicted in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we will consider the most general situation where @xmath107 and the following coefficients ( we have dropped the time dependence for simplicity ) : @xmath108 thus , the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of eq.[hamilt_stirap ] read @xcite : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 the basis b that diagonalizes the hamiltonian of eq.[hamilt_stirap ] can be written in terms of the vectors @xmath112 where @xmath113 for @xmath114 introducing the normalization factor @xmath115 the basis b can be finally defined as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 for @xmath114 accordingly , the matrix that defines the basis change b@xmath62b is defined by @xmath118 it must be noticed that for @xmath119 , i.e. , when both laser pulses are @xmath120 , the vectors of the basis b are aligned with the vectors of the basis b ( see appendix[projection ] ) . more concretely",

    "the rotation axis ( red solid line ) as well as the different trajectories are also indicated .    following the same argumentation of the previous section , for obtaining the adiabatic condition it is necessary to compare the hamiltonian expressed in the base b , i.e. , @xmath134 with @xmath135 ( see eq.[diff_eigenvectors ] ) .",
    "explicitly @xmath135 can be written as : @xmath136 with @xmath137 since the diagonal elements @xmath138 are proportional to @xmath139 and provided that @xmath140 is a unit vector , they result equal to zero .",
    "if at the beginning of the interaction the population is in the ground state , the statevector of the system is initially aligned with @xmath141 ( see eq.[conexion ] ) . according to this , to investigate the conditions for adiabatic evolution the possible crossings between @xmath142 and @xmath143 or @xmath144 eigenenergies must be investigated .",
    "as it was discussed before , for avoiding the crossings between the eigenvectors , the difference between the eigenvalues must be larger than the non - diagonal terms that could produce this crossings .",
    "mathematically , and taking into account the previous definitions , this can be expressed as ( see eq.[eigenvalues ] ) : @xmath145 since p is a growing function with respect to the rabi frequencies @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( see eq.[equation_p ] ) , the possible crossing will take place at the very beginning of the interaction .",
