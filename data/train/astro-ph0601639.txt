    "we are carrying out a survey of the dynamics and stellar populations of 72 representative nearby early - type galaxies and spiral bulges based on measurements of the two - dimensional kinematics and line strengths of stars and gas with sauron , a custom - built panoramic integral - field spectrograph for the william herschel telescope , la palma ( bacon et al .",

    "we summarize selected results of the absorption line strength measurements , which are described more fully in kuntschner et al .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of integral - field spectroscopy is the capability to identify two - dimensional structures .",
    "for the first time we can use this in connection with line strength indices and compare isoindex contours with the isophotal shape .",
    "one might expect the index to follow the light in slowly - rotating giant elliptical galaxies , since the stars are dynamically well mixed .",
    "however , one could imagine that dynamical substructures with significantly different stellar populations could leave a signature in line strength maps which are sensitive to e.g. , metallicity .",
    "the mg@xmath1 index is the most stringent feature in our survey and potential differences between isoindex contours and isophotes should be most apparent .",
    "indeed we find a number of galaxies in our survey where the isoindex contours clearly do not follow the isophotes , e.g. , ngc4570 and ngc4660 ( see fig .",
    "[ figg : mgb_n4570 ] ) .",
    "both galaxies show fast - rotating components along the direction of enhanced mg@xmath1 strength . in order to further study such a possible connection we determine the best fitting simple , elliptical model for each of the reconstructed images and mg@xmath1 maps in our survey ( excluding all galaxies with significant dust absorption ) .",

    "16 out of 41 galaxies appear to have more flattened mg@xmath1 contours than the isophotes .",
    "most of these galaxies show a high degree of rotational support in the direction of enhanced mg@xmath1 strength .",
    "thus , the flattened mg@xmath1 distribution suggests that the fast - rotating components in these galaxies exhibit a stellar population different from the main body .",

    "in order to provide a global measurement of the stellar populations for each galaxy we derive a central averaged spectrum from all data available within one effective radius @xmath5 . since our line strength maps do not always cover the full area of one effective radius we apply aperture corrections",
    ". however , even the galaxies with the smallest coverage ( ngc4486 and ngc5846 ) feature line strength data out to about 30% of @xmath5 ( corresponds to a field coverage of @xmath6 ) and corrections remain small ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the median coverage of the line strength maps in our survey is @xmath8    estimates of the luminosity weighted age and metallicity of early - type galaxies can be inferred from index - index diagrams .",
    "generally a metallicity sensitive index is plotted against an age sensitive index . in order to minimize the influence of abundance ratio variations on our metallicity estimates we use a composite index [ mgfe50]@xmath9 .",
    "this index is constructed such that a mean metallicity is measured rather than a metallicity biased by non - solar abundance ratios .",

    "there is weak evidence that ellipticals in the field may on average have experienced some `` frosting '' of young stars yielding lower luminosity weighted age estimates .",

    "the results presented here are the outcome of the first comprehensive survey of the line strength distributions of nearby early - type galaxies with an integral - field spectrograph .",
    "this data set demonstrates that many nearby early - type galaxies display a significant and varied structure in their line strength properties .",
    "this structure can be of subtle nature as seen in the deviations of mg@xmath1 isoindex contours compared to the isophotes of galaxies .",
