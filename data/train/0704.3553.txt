    "<S> we show that the centrality and system - size dependence of elliptic flow measured at rhic are fully described by a simple model based on eccentricity scaling and incomplete thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the elliptic flow is at least 25% below the ( ideal ) `` hydrodynamic limit '' , even for the most central au - au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this lack of perfect equilibration allows for estimates of the effective parton cross section in the quark - gluon plasma and of its viscosity to entropy density ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how the initial conditions affect the transport coefficients and thermodynamic quantities extracted from the data , in particular the viscosity and the speed of sound .    </S>",
    "<S> when two ultrarelativistic nuclei collide at non - zero impact parameter , their overlap area in the transverse plane has a short axis , parallel to the impact parameter , and a long axis perpendicular to it . </S>",
    "<S> this almond shape of the initial profile is converted by the pressure gradient into a momentum asymmetry , so that more particles are emitted along the short axis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of this effect is characterized by elliptic flow , defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the azimuthal angle of an outgoing particle , @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle of the impact parameter , and angular brackets denote an average over many particles and many events . </S>",
    "<S> the unexpected large magnitude of elliptic flow at rhic  @xcite has generated a lot of activity in recent years .    </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow results from the interactions between the produced particles , and can be used to probe local thermodynamic equilibrium . if the produced matter equilibrates , it behaves as an ideal fluid . </S>",
    "<S> hydrodynamics predicts that at a given energy , @xmath3 scales like the eccentricity @xmath4 of the almond  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is independent of its transverse size @xmath5 , as a consequence of the scale invariance of ideal - fluid dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> if , on the other hand , equilibration is incomplete , then eccentricity scaling is broken and @xmath6 also depends on the knudsen number @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the length scale over which a parton is deflected by a large angle .    here , we show that the centrality dependence of @xmath6 , for both au+au and cu+cu collisions , can be described by the following simple formula  @xcite : @xmath9 @xmath6 is largest in the hydrodynamic limit @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the first order corrections to this limit , corresponding to viscous effects , are linear in @xmath11 . for large mean - free path , far from the hydrodynamic limit , @xmath12 vanishes like the number of collisions per particle . </S>",
    "<S> one expects the transition between these two regimes to occur when @xmath13 , hence that @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> a recent transport calculation  @xcite in two spatial dimensions indeed obtained @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow develops gradually during the early stages of the collision . </S>",
    "<S> due to the strong longitudinal expansion , the thermodynamic properties of the medium depend on the time @xmath16 , of course . </S>",
    "<S> the average particle density , for instance , decreases like @xmath17 ( if their number is approximately conserved , see recent discussion in  @xcite ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the total ( charged + neutral ) multiplicity per unit rapidity , and @xmath20 is the transverse overlap area between the two nuclei . the quantities that we shall extract from @xmath3 should be intepreted as averages over the transverse area @xmath20 , and over some time interval around @xmath21 , which is the typical time scale for the build - up of @xmath3 in hydrodynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 denotes the velocity of sound .    the knudsen number @xmath11 is defined by evaluating the mean free path @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is a partonic cross section ) at @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath26 the purpose of this letter is to show that the centrality and system - size dependence of the data for @xmath3 at rhic is described very well by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v2k ] ) and  ( [ knud ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides three important pieces of information . </S>",
    "<S> first , such a fit allows us to `` measure '' the knudsen number corresponding to a given centrality , which quantifies how close the dense matter produced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic is to perfect fluidity . </S>",
    "<S> second , the extrapolation to @xmath27 allows us to read off the limiting value for @xmath28 extracted from the _ data _ ; this is useful for constraining the equation of state ( eos ) of qcd via hydrodynamic simulations , and we shall also see that it exhibits a rather surprising dependence on the initial conditions . finally , using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ knud ] ) , we can convert the knudsen number into the typical partonic cross section @xmath24 ( and viscosity ) in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . </S>",
    "<S> since only the combination @xmath29 actually appears in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v2k ] ) , uncertainties in @xmath30 or @xmath22 then translate into corresponding uncertainties of @xmath24 . unless mentioned otherwise , our standard choice is @xmath31 ( ideal quark - gluon plasma ) and @xmath32 . letting @xmath33 and @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> instead reduces the estimated @xmath24 by a factor of two ; on the other hand , taking @xmath35 and @xmath36 increases @xmath24 by the same factor .    for the elliptic flow , @xmath3 , we use phobos data for au - au @xcite and cu - cu  @xcite collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the same analysis could be carried out using data from phenix  @xcite or star  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the initial eccentricity @xmath4 and the transverse density @xmath37 are evaluated using a model of the collision . </S>",
    "<S> two such models will be compared . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining parameters @xmath38 and @xmath24 are fit to the data . </S>",
    "<S> the first step is to plot @xmath6 versus @xmath37  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such plots have already been obtained at sps and rhic  @xcite , and they are puzzling : while @xmath6 increases with centrality , it shows no hint of the _ saturation _ predicted by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v2k ] ) for @xmath39 , suggesting that the system is far from equilibrium  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath3 for central au - au collisions at rhic is about as high as predicted by hydrodynamics , which is widely considered as key evidence that a `` perfect liquid '' has been created at rhic  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it was understood only recently that the eccentricity of the overlap zone has so far been underestimated , as the result of two effects . </S>",
    "<S> the first effect is fluctuations in initial conditions  @xcite : the time scale of the nucleus - nucleus collision at rhic is so short that each nucleus remains in a frozen configuration , with its nucleons distributed according to the nuclear wave function . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in the nucleon positions result in fluctuations of the overlap area . </S>",
    "<S> their effect on elliptic flow was first pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was later realized by the phobos collaboration  @xcite that the orientation of the almond may also fluctuate , so that @xmath2 in eq .  ( [ defv2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is no longer the direction of impact parameter , but the minor axis of the ellipse defined by the positions of the nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuations explain both the large magnitude of @xmath3 for small systems , such as cu - cu collisions , as well as the non - zero magnitude of @xmath3 in central collisions , where the eccentricity would otherwise vanish . </S>",
    "<S> they have to be taken into account in order to observe the expected saturation of @xmath6 at high density mentioned above .    </S>",
    "<S> the eccentricity is usually estimated from the distribution of participant nucleons in the transverse plane ( glauber model ) . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we assume here that the density distribution of produced particles is given by a fixed 80%:20% superposition of participant and binary - collision scaling , respectively  @xcite . for au - au collisions , </S>",
    "<S> this simple model reproduces the centrality dependence of the multiplicity reasonably well ( we assume that charged particles are 2/3 of the total multiplicity , and that @xmath40 at midrapidity ) , while it underestimates it for central cu - cu collisions by about 10% .    at high energies a second effect which increases the eccentricity is perturbative gluon saturation , which determines the @xmath41-integrated multiplicity from weak - coupling qcd without additional models for soft particle production . </S>",
    "<S> high - density qcd ( the `` color - glass condensate '' ) predicts a different distribution of produced gluons , @xmath42 , which gives a similar centrality dependence of the multiplicity  @xcite but a larger eccentricity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when particle production is dominated by transverse momenta below the saturation scale of the denser nucleus , then @xmath43 traces the participant density of the more dilute collision partner , rather than the average as in the glauber model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> precise figures depend on how the saturation scale is defined  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> naively , the larger initial eccentricity predicted by the gluon saturation approach is expected to require more dissipation in order to reproduce the same experimentally measured @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> somewhat surprisingly , we shall find that this expectation is incorrect , which underscores the non - trivial role played by the initial conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> both effects , fluctuations and gluon saturation , were recently combined by drescher and nara  @xcite . in their approach , the saturation momenta and </S>",
    "<S> the unintegrated gluon distribution functions of the colliding nuclei are determined for each configuration individually . </S>",
    "<S> the finite interaction range of the nucleons is also taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> upon convolution of the projectile and target unintegrated gluon distribution functions and averaging over configurations , the model leads to a very good description of the multiplicity for both au - au as well as cu - cu collisions over the entire available range of centralities .    </S>",
    "<S> having determined the density distributions of produced particles from either model as described above , we obtain the eccentricity via  @xcite @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the respective root - mean - square widths of the density distributions , and @xmath47 ( a bar denotes a convolution with the density distribution for a given configuration while brackets stand for averages over configurations ) . the overlap area @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> is defined by @xmath48  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find it more appropriate to define these moments via the number density distribution @xmath42 rather than the energy density distribution @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is twofold : first , @xmath3 is extracted experimentally from the azimuthal distribution of particle number , not transverse energy ; second , our cgc approach describes the centrality dependence of the _ measured _ final - state multiplicity very well , which indicates that the ratio of final - state particles to initial - state gluons ( including possible gluon multiplication processes  @xcite ) is essentially constant .    ) and ( [ knud ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : glauber ] and [ fig : cgc ] display @xmath6 as a function of @xmath37 for au - au and cu - cu collisions at various centralities , within the glauber and cgc approaches , respectively . for both types of initial conditions , cu - cu and au - au collisions at the same </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 give the same @xmath6 within error bars . </S>",
    "<S> eccentricity fluctuations are crucial for this agreement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the figures also show that eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v2k ] ) and ( [ knud ] ) provide a good fit to the data , for both sets of initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the values of the fit parameters clearly depend on the initial conditions , which has important consequences for the physics .    </S>",
    "<S> the first physical quantity extracted from the fit is the hydrodynamic limit , @xmath50 , obtained by extrapolating to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the values are @xmath52 with the glauber parameterization , and @xmath53 with cgc initial conditions . comparing these numbers to the experimental data points </S>",
    "<S> one observes that deviations from ideal hydrodynamics are as large as 30% , even for central au - au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this is our first important result .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , a quantitative extraction of the qcd eos from rhic data via hydrodynamic analysis was hampered by the fact that @xmath6 had not been factorized into the perfect - fluid part @xmath50 and the dissipative correction @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , huovinen found  @xcite that an eos with a rapid cross - over rather than a strong first - order phase transition , as favored by lattice qcd  @xcite , overpredicted the flow data . </S>",
    "<S> this finding was rather puzzling , too , as it was widely believed that the rhic data fully saturates the hydrodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that ideal hydrodynamics _ should _ in fact overpredict the measured flow . that is , that one should not choose an eos in perfect - fluid simulations that fits the data </S>",
    "<S> rather , the eos could be extracted by comparing ideal hydrodynamics to @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> the next result is that cgc initial conditions , which predict a higher initial eccentricity @xmath4 , naturally lead to a lower hydrodynamic limit @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> now , close to the ideal - gas limit ( @xmath55 ) , @xmath50 scales approximately like the sound velocity @xmath22  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that cgc initial conditions imply a lower average speed of sound ( softer equation of state ) than glauber initial conditions , by a factor of @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> the second fit parameter is the partonic cross section @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the larger @xmath24 , the faster the saturation of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath37 . for our standard values of @xmath30 and @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath57  mb for glauber initial conditions and @xmath58  mb for cgc initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> these values are significantly smaller than those found in previous transport calculations  @xcite , but match the findings of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> cgc initial conditions imply a larger value of @xmath24 than glauber initial conditions , that is , a _ </S>",
    "<S> lower _ viscosity . this can be easily understood . as already mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , the cgc predicts a larger eccentricity @xmath4 than the glauber model for semi - central collisions of large nuclei ( when there is a large asymmetry in the local saturation scales of the collision partners , along a path in impact - parameter direction away from the origin  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for very peripheral collisions or small nuclei , there is of course very little asymmetry in the saturation scales , and the eccentricity approaches the same value as in the glauber model . </S>",
    "<S> this has been checked numerically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 7 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and can also be clearly seen by comparing our figures : while in fig .  [ fig : cgc ] @xmath6 for semi - central au+au collisions is lower than in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : glauber ] , there is no visible difference for peripheral cu+cu collisions . in all , with cgc initial conditions the scaled flow grows less rapidly with the transverse density , which is the reason for the larger elementary cross - section .    the dependence of @xmath24 on the initial conditions is probably even stronger than the numerical values above suggest , for the following reason . as alluded to above , our fit to the data really determines the product @xmath59 , rather than @xmath24 alone . </S>",
    "<S> it appears reasonable to assume that @xmath30 does not depend on the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> however , for consistency , the speed of sound @xmath22 entering the knudsen number should match the one underlying the hydrodynamic limit @xmath60 ; hence , if cgc initial conditions require a smaller @xmath22 by a factor @xmath61 , the elementary cross - section obtained above should be rescaled accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to our final estimate @xmath62  mb .    </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results for @xmath24 should be taken as rough estimates rather than precise figures , because of the uncertainties related to the precise values of @xmath30 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , tempting to convert them into estimates of the shear viscosity @xmath63 , which has been of great interest lately . </S>",
    "<S> a universal lower bound @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 is the entropy density ) has been conjectured using a correspondence with black - hole physics  @xcite , and it has been argued that the viscosity of qcd might be close to the lower bound . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolations of perturbative estimates to temperatures @xmath66  mev , on the other hand , suggest that the viscosity of qcd could be much larger  @xcite . on the microscopic side , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 is related to the scattering cross - section @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> following teaney  @xcite , the relation for a classical gas of massless particles with isotropic differential cross sections ( which applies , for example , to a boltzmann - transport model ) is @xmath67  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the entropy density of a classical ultrarelativistic cas is @xmath68 , with @xmath69 the particle density , so that @xmath70 the relevant particle density in au - au collisions at rhic , which is estimated at the time when @xmath3 develops  @xcite , is 3.9  @xmath71 for both glauber and cgc initial conditions , and @xmath72  mev . </S>",
    "<S> our two estimates @xmath73  mb ( glauber initial conditions ) and @xmath74  mb ( cgc initial conditions ) thus translate into @xmath75  fm , @xmath76 and @xmath77  fm , @xmath78 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values for @xmath79 agree with those from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite if the mean - free path is scaled to our result , and also with estimates of @xmath79 based on the observed energy loss and elliptic flow of heavy quarks  @xcite , on transverse momentum correlations  @xcite , or bounds on entropy production  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for our best fit(s ) @xmath79 is slightly larger than the conjectured lower bound , but significantly smaller than extrapolations from perturbative estimates . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> our lower value is close to a recent lattice estimate  @xcite for su(3 ) gluodynamics , which gives @xmath80 at @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> a complementary approach to incorporate corrections from the ideal - fluid limit is viscous relativistic hydrodynamics . a formulation that is suitable for applications to high - energy heavy - ion collisions </S>",
    "<S> has been developped in recent years  @xcite . a first calculation of elliptic flow  @xcite shows that for glauber initial conditions and @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath3 reaches about @xmath83 of the ideal - fluid value for semi - central au - au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that our simple estimates are in good agreement with this finding . using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eta ] ) , @xmath82 corresponds to @xmath84  mb , for which eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v2k ] ) and ( [ knud ] ) give @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison to experimental data in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , however , appears to favor lower values of @xmath79 because the eos used there underpredicts @xmath86 required for glauber initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , simulations could be performed with cgc initial conditions which require only @xmath87 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the centrality and system - size dependence of the _ measured _ @xmath3 can be understood as follows : @xmath3 scales like the initial eccentricity @xmath4 ( as predicted by hydrodynamics ) , multiplied by a correction factor due to off - equilibrium ( i.e. , viscous ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> this correction involves the multiplicity density in the overlap area , @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> two types of initial conditions have been compared : a glauber - type model , and a color - glass condensate approach . </S>",
    "<S> phobos data can be described with both . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , there is good agreement between cu - cu and au - au data . </S>",
