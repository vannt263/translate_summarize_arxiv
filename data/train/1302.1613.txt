    "about half of edge - on disk galaxies contain boxy or peanut - shaped bulges ( bpbs , * ? ? ?",
    "their photometric and kinematic properties are consistent with predictions from disk galaxy simulations in which a bpb formed through bar and buckling instabilities @xcite . the galactic bulge shows many characteristics of a bpb formed in this way : a boxy shape in projection @xcite ; a triaxial density distribution @xcite with a dense inner , rounder component ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gmv12 ) ; an x - shaped structure @xcite ; cylindrical rotation @xcite ; and a transition to an outer planar bar ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mvg11 ) , seen in star count observations as long bar @xcite .",
    "the galactic bulge is also known to consist of predominantly old stars @xcite with a broad , asymmetric metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) @xcite .",
    "the data clearly show a vertical metallicity gradient , such that the more metal - rich part of the mdf thins out towards high latitudes ( @xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at latitudes lower than baade s window ( @xmath1 )",
    "no vertical gradient is seen @xcite .",
    "these properties are not obviously reconciled with a disk origin of the bulge . because bars tend to mix stars from different radii and so wash out preexisting metallicity gradients @xcite , the observed metallicity gradient in the galactic bulge",
    "has long been taken as a signature for a classical bulge in the milky way .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that they could not reproduce the observed gradient with a simulated boxy bulge which had evolved from a pure disk with an initial metallicity gradient . in order to obtain the lower mean metallicities at high @xmath2",
    ", they needed to include an additional metal - poor thick disk in their initial model .    here",
    "we show with the help of a suitable boxy bulge / bar simulation , that contrary to widespread belief boxy bulges can have metallicity gradients similar to those observed in our galaxy and in other boxy bulges , if they evolve from disks with similarly steep radial metallicity gradients .",
    "the simulation used in this work is that already analyzed in mvg11 and gmv12 , with similar characteristics as described in @xcite .",
    "the model evolved from an exponential disk , with @xmath3 , initial radial scale length of @xmath4  kpc and vertical scale height of @xmath5  kpc , embedded in a dark matter halo . following bar and buckling instabilities it developed a prominent boxy bulge which is already relaxed at @xmath6  gyr .",
    "as in gmv12 we consider the simulated galaxy at time @xmath7  gyr when the bar has resumed its growth through further angular momentum transfer to the halo , and we vertically symmetrize the particle distribution to optimize the resolution .",
    "we showed previously that this model reproduces different milky way star count observations , both near the galactic plane for the long bar out to @xmath8 ( mvg11 ) , and in the inner boxy bulge for @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( gmv12 ) as well as for @xmath11 , where the predictions of the model were subsequently confirmed by @xcite . here",
    "we show that the model s boxy bulge at that time also shows approximate cylindrical rotation , with the slope of the mean velocity curve along @xmath12 increasing slightly towards lower latitudes ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics ] .",
    "this is similar to the brava kinematic data @xcite and the simulation by @xcite .",
    "the cylindrical rotation in boxy bulges is clearest in edge - on view , as shown in previous simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is weakened by the nearly end - on orientation of the milky way bar and the perspective effects . as in our previous work ( mvg11 , gmv12 ) , we here take the solar galactocentric distance @xmath13  kpc , scale the bar length to @xmath14  kpc , and use a bar orientation of @xmath15 with respect to the sun - galactic center line .",
    "we study the formation of bulge metallicity gradients in the unstable disk ",
    "boxy bulge scenario with a simple illustrative model .",
    "we assume that the initial exponential disk follows a specified radial metallicity gradient , which we imagine is set up during disk build - up prior to bar formation .",
    "we assign to each particle a metallicity depending on its initial radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , according to @xmath16(r)=[m / h]_0+\\alpha_{r}\\times r/{\\rm kpc}$ ] . after some exploration",
    "we choose @xmath16_0=0.6 $ ] and @xmath17 .",
    "unlike @xcite , we do not link these metallicities to the present - day galactic disk near the sun , because the buckling instability in the milky way must have happened long ago when the outer disk may have been only incompletely assembled .",
    "the bar and buckling instabilities leading to the formation of the boxy bulge strongly change the particle orbits . thereby the initial disk metallicity distribution is mapped into the bulge accordingly .",
    "[ fig : rv_grad ] shows longitudinal and vertical metallicity profiles for the bulge at @xmath18 .",
    "the vertical gradient for @xmath19 along the minor axis is @xmath20  dex / deg , compared to the observed slope in the milky way bulge @xmath21",
    "dex / deg from @xcite and @xmath22  dex / deg from @xcite . near the galactic plane , @xmath23 , the vertical gradient becomes flatter and even positive .",
    "the positive gradient is due to the contamination from foreground / background disk particles .",
    "the flat part comes from the mixing during the buckling instability in the inner regions that evolve into the central near - spheroidal component ( gmv12 ) , and also from the greater fraction of low - latitude outer bar particles .",
    "the absence of a clear vertical gradient near the galactic plane is consistent with recent results from @xcite .",
    "however , their measured mean metallicities for m - giants ( [ fe / h]@xmath24 ) are slightly lower in baade s window than those for k - giants @xcite and for our simple model .",
    "[ fig : vgrad ] shows the resulting mdfs in several minor axis fields in the boxy bulge at @xmath25 gyr .",
    "note the clear gradient of mean metallicity with latitude , and that similarly to the observed histograms , it arises mostly from the decreasing fraction of higher metallicity stars away from the galactic plane .",
    "the maximum metallicity in all histograms is @xmath26 , the central value in the initial disk , and the lowest value is @xmath27 .",
    "2 gyr later , at @xmath28 gyr , the model metallicity gradient is nearly identical , while the mean metallicities in the minor axis fields have slightly decreased , due to the capture of lower - metallicity disk stars by the slowly growing bar .",
    "had we assumed a shallower radial gradient in the initial disk , also the final vertical gradient in the bulge would be smaller .",
    "so far we have shown that a radial metallicity gradient in the unstable initial disk can survive through the bar and buckling instabilities , and generate , for suitable parameters , a vertical metallicity gradient similar to that observed in the milky way bulge .",
    "for comparison with upcoming survey results ( e.g. , vvv , argos , gaia - eso ) , we now provide a full metallicity map , which gives a different view of the predicted metallicities for this scenario . differently from fig .",
    "[ fig : vgrad ] , we exclude foreground / background disk stars with a distance cut , using only particles with @xmath29  kpc from the position of the sun .",
    "the assumed initial disk metallicity distribution and simulated galaxy snapshot are as before .",
    "[ fig : map_grad ] shows the resulting average bulge metallicity map over the area on the sky extended by the galactic bulge .",
    "it has several noteworthy properties :    \\(i ) the approximate outline of the boxy bulge can be seen together with low - metallicity indentations in the galactic plane .",
    "the latter are due to foregroud / background stars in the planar bar , which in these positions dominate the bulge stars .",
    "\\(ii ) a metallicity gradient is present in all directions on the sky , both vertically and radially .",
    "this is expected from the binding energy argument of sect .",
    "[ sec : mechanism ] .",
    "however , in the central few degrees the gradients become shallower .",
    "\\(iii ) iso - metallicity contours are more elongated vertically than horizontally , whereas the surface density contours are flattened to the plane ( mvg11 ) .",
    "\\(iv ) the asymmetry between @xmath30 and @xmath31 at intermediate latitudes is due to perspective effects and signifies the bar origin . in fig .",
    "[ fig : map_grad ] high metallicities extend to larger @xmath32 on the @xmath30 side at @xmath33 , but for @xmath34 they extend to larger @xmath35 on the @xmath31 side .",
    "this map has some remarkable similarities with that being constructed from the near - infrared photometric vista vvv survey @xcite .",
    "for now we can compare quantitatively with a few more measured values in off - axis fields .",
    "details will of course depend on the parametrisation of our simple model . in the longitudinal direction the gradient along @xmath36 is @xmath37  dex / deg ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rv_grad ] ) .",
    "@xcite found mean metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath38 in two fields at @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) for bulge stars selected with [ fe / h]@xmath41 .",
    "the model values in these fields are -0.30 and -0.28 .",
    "clearly , while the bar and buckling instabilities scramble the orbits of disk stars , they do not do so enough to completely erase the preexisting metallicity gradient .",
    "high - metallicity stars tightly bound to the galactic center initially remain more tightly bound in the final bulge , and initially more loosely bound stars with lower metallicities end up at larger final radii , on average .",
    "this can be quantified by considering the change in jacobi energy @xmath42 in the rotating frame of the boxy bulge and bar during the evolution .",
    "here we use standard cylindrical coordinates , @xmath43 is total velocity , @xmath44 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath45 is the pattern speed at @xmath25 gyr . fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] shows that particles are scattered in jacobi energy by the two instabilities , but only over a fraction of the available total range in @xmath46 .",
    "i.e. , they retain some memory of their initial values . it has also been shown that most bar particles inside the vertical inner lindblad resonance ( vilr ) mix during the buckling instability , but stay in the inner bar regions , while most bar particles around vilr are scattered to orbits which can visit larger heights @xcite .    from these arguments",
    "follows that the number of high - metallicity particles in the final boxy bulge will decrease with height above the plane where @xmath47 becomes less negative .",
    "in the histograms of fig .  [",
    "fig : vgrad ] , therefore , the number of stars on the metal - rich part of the distribution decreases with latitude .",
    "the maximum metallicity in all histograms , but that at @xmath48 , is still given by the assumed maximum metallicity at the center of the initial disk , here @xmath49 , because a small fraction of the tightly bound particles is scattered up even to @xmath50 .",
    "the low - metallicity tail , on the other hand , is more prominent at high latitudes , because of the larger fraction of particles coming from the outer parts of the bar .",
    "note that within the assumed model , a lower limit to the metallicity in the bulge fields is expected , which is set by the outer boundary of the part of the disk which participates in the instability .",
    "from the histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : vgrad ] , this is @xmath51 , which is due to particles in the initial disk at @xmath52 , just inside the corotation radius of the bar before buckling , @xmath53 kpc .",
    "these properties of the model histograms are surprisingly similar to those of the galactic bulge mdfs discussed in the literature .",
    "if our scenario were the full explanation for the metallicity structure of the galactic bulge , the observed range in the metallicity histograms could be used directly to estimate the central metallicity and the radial gradient in the inner galactic disk prior to bar formation and buckling .",
    "the observational histograms , however , also contain metal - poor stellar halo and thick disk stars , and possibly metal - rich disk stars formed after the buckling , which must be taken into account in this argument .",
    "finally we note that a radial metallicity gradient in the precursor disk could have been accompanied by a stellar age gradient . in the context of the present model , depending on the time of buckling",
    ", this could lead to a measurable vertical age gradient in the boxy bulge which would provide an independent test of the model .",
    "vertical gradients have so far been published only for a small number of galaxies with boxy bulges .",
    "@xcite found a vertical metallicity gradient in ngc 7332 comparable to that in the milky way .",
    "@xcite determined vertical gradients in two other boxy bulges , ngc 1381 and ngc 3390 .",
    "they integrated along slits parallel to the major axis to increase signal - to - noise , and obtained a single bulge measurement at several @xmath54 .",
    "a similar averaging over @xmath55 $ ] in our model reduces the measured gradient from @xmath56  dex / kpc to @xmath57  dex / kpc , because radial and vertical gradients are comparable . still , in ngc  1381 the observations show a strong gradient of averaged @xmath58  dex / kpc , while only a weak gradient is seen in ngc  3390 , @xmath59  dex / kpc ( @xmath60 $ ]  arcsec ) .",
    "@xcite found negative metallicity gradients along the _ major axis _ for the majority of bulges in barred galaxies , while @xcite found a range of major axis metallicity gradients in boxy bulges , from negative to positive , with shallower sample average than for unbarred early - type galaxies . in summary ,",
    "the limited data suggest a range of metallicity gradients in boxy bulges , with the metallicity gradient in the milky way on the steep side . in the framework discussed here , this suggests a range of initial disk metallicity gradients before buckling in these galaxies , perhaps depending on the time of bulge formation .",
    "the results presented in the previous subsections are consistent with early n - body simulation work by @xcite .",
    "he found that pre - existing _ vertical _ abundance gradients in the disk were quickly flattened both in the bar and disk regions but not entirely erased .",
    "their models also included a shallow , outward _ radial _ gradient , which became much flatter in the disk region due to the mixing induced by the bar , but was approximately preserved in the bar region .",
    "@xcite also stated that when no initial vertical gradient was present , a negative vertical gradient appeared at @xmath61 .",
    "however , in his model the initial gradient was @xmath62  dex / kpc , while the model analyzed here has initial @xmath17  dex / kpc , for similar bar size . in our model the final gradient along the bar is @xmath63  dex / kpc and the final vertical gradient is @xmath56  dex / kpc ( for @xmath64 $ ] ) .",
    "consistent with @xcite we also find that at larger @xmath12 the vertical gradient is shallower ( fig  [ fig : rv_grad ] , _ right _ ) .",
    "recent n - body numerical simulations by @xcite for a pure exponential disk initial model ( pds in their nomenclature ) showed only a very shallow vertical gradient in the final boxy bulge .",
    "the difference to our results can be traced to the different initial disk metallicity profile .",
    "while their inner disk parameters are similar to ours , due to linking the profile to the present metallicity near the sun , their profile becomes quite shallow beyond @xmath65 times the eventual final bar length .",
    "thus the stars in the upper bulge which come from the outer parts of the bar are quite metal - rich .",
    "the difference , and the reason for the steep vertical gradient in the bulge of our model is its steep initial radial gradient in the disk",
    ".    finally we note that if the secular evolution proceeds slowly , a radial gradient in the disk before the instability may be ( partially ) erased by migration processes .",
    "thus a steep final bulge gradient is favoured by rapid secular evolution such as in the model investigated here .",
    "we can summarize our conclusions as follows :    \\(i ) the vertical metallicity gradient observed in the galactic bulge can be reproduced with a secularly evolved barred galaxy model in which a boxy bulge formed after a buckling instability . in itself , a vertical gradient is therefore not a strong argument for the existence of a classical bulge in the milky way .",
    "the success of our simple model in explaining milky way observations suggests that its underlying idea has some merit and should be pursued further .",
    "future work also needs to consider chemical evolution and possible vertical metallicity gradients in the initial disk , star formation induced by the bar , the possible late build - up of a metal rich inner disk , and the contribution of halo stars and other components @xcite to the bulge mdfs .",
    "another important next step for understanding the origin of the milky way bulge is to investigate the correlations between metallicities and kinematics in this model and in generalisations of it .",
    "comparison with similar observations @xcite is likely to shed light on the possible multi - component nature of the galactic bulge .",
    "the results will be important also for interpreting the data for bulges in external galaxies ."
