    "microlensing is one of the promising techniques that can be used to search for extra - solar planets , especially located at large distances @xcite .",
    "planet detection via microlensing is possible because the lensing event caused by a lens system containing a planet can produce noticeable anomalies in the resulting light curve when the source passes close to the lens caustics , which represents the source positions on which the lensing magnification of a point source event becomes infinity @xcite . for a lens system with a planet , there exist two or three disconnected sets of caustics . among them , one is located close to the primary lens ( central caustic ) and the other(s ) is ( are ) located away from the primary lens ( planetary caustic[s ] ) . accordingly ,",
    "there exist two types of planet - induced anomalies : one affected by the planetary caustic ( type i anomaly ) and the other affected by the central caustic ( type ii anomaly ) @xcite .",
    "compared to the frequency of type i anomalies , type ii anomaly occurs with a relatively low frequency due to the smaller size of the central caustic compared to the corresponding planetary caustic .",
    "however , the efficiency of detecting type ii anomalies can be high because intensive monitoring is possible due to the predictable time of anomalies , i.e.  near the peak of magnification , and the known type of candidate events for intensive follow - up monitoring , i.e.  very high magnification events @xcite .",
    "keeping the high efficiency of type ii anomaly detections in mind , @xcite pointed out that if an event is caused by a lens system having multiple planets located in the lensing zone , within which the chance for the occurrence of planet - induced anomalies is maximized , all planets will affect the central region of magnification pattern , and thus the existence of multiple planets can be inferred by detecting additionally deformed anomalies from intensive monitoring of high magnification events .",
    "this method , however , has important limitations in identifying the existence of multiple planets and determining their parameters ( the mass ratio and the instantaneous separation between each planet and the host star ) .",
    "this is because the anomalies induced by multiple planets are in many cases qualitatively degenerate from that induced by a single planet and even if the existence of the multiple planets is known , accurate determination of the individual planet parameters will be difficult due to the complexity of multiple planet lensing models .    in this paper , we propose a new channel to search for extra - solar systems composed of multiple planets via microlensing .",
    "the method is based on the finding of @xcite that the lensing light curve anomalies induced by multiple planets are well approximated by the superposition of those of the single planet systems where the individual planet - primary pairs act as independent lens systems .",
    "then , if the source trajectories passes both of the outer deviation regions around the planetary caustics of the individual planets , one can identify the existence of the multiple planets .",
    "we illustrate that the probability of successively detecting lensing light curve anomalies induced by two jovian - mass planets located in the lensing zone through this channel will be substantial .",
    "we discuss the advantages of the proposed method over the previous method of monitoring high magnification events .",
    "if a source located at @xmath0 on the projected plane of the sky is lensed by a lens system composed of @xmath1-point masses , where the individual components masses and locations are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the positions of the resulting images , @xmath4 , are obtained by solving the lens equation of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total mass of the lens system and @xmath7 is the angular einstein ring radius .",
    "the angular einstein ring radius is related to the physical parameters of the lens system by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the distances to the lens and the source from the observer , respectively .",
    "since the lensing process conserves the surface brightness of the source , the magnification of each image is simply given by the surface area ratio between the image and the unamplified source , and mathematically its value corresponds to the inverse of the jacobian of the lens equation evaluated at the image position @xmath11 ; @xmath12 the total magnification is then given by the sum of the individual images magnifications , i.e.  @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total number of images .",
    "for a single point - mass lens ( @xmath15 ) , there are two solutions for the lens equation ( @xmath16 ) and the resulting total magnification is expressed in a simple analytical form of @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dimensionless lens - source separation vector normalized by @xmath7 . for a rectilinear lens - source transverse motion ,",
    "the separation vector is related to the single lensing parameters by @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the time required for the source to transit @xmath7 ( einstein time scale ) , @xmath21 is the closest lens - source separation in units of @xmath7 ( impact parameter ) , @xmath22 is the time at that moment , and the unit vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 are parallel with and normal to the direction of the relative lens - source transverse motion , respectively .",
    "the lens system with planets is described by the formalism of multiple lensing with very low mass companions . for a binary lens system ( @xmath25 ) , the lens equation becomes a fifth order polynomial in @xmath26 and the positions of the individual images are obtained by numerically solving the equation @xcite .",
    "this yields three or five solutions depending on the source position with respect to the lenses .",
    "the main new feature of a multiple lens system is the formation of caustics . for a binary lens , the set of caustics",
    "form several disconnected closed curves .",
    "the number and locations of the caustic curves are dependent on the separation between the planet and the primary lens .",
    "if the separation is larger than @xmath7 , there exist two sets of caustics and one is the central caustic located near the primary lens and the other is the planetary caustic located away from the primary on the planet side with respect to the primary .",
    "the lens system having a planet with a separation smaller than @xmath7 also has a single central caustic , but has two planetary caustics located on the opposite side of the planet .",
    "the planetary caustic(s ) is ( are ) located within the einstein ring when the projected separation between the planet and the primary ( normalized by @xmath7 ) is in the lensing zone of @xmath27 . since the sizes of both the central and planetary caustics are maximized at around this separation , planet detection probability is also maximized for systems having planets located in this lensing zone @xcite .    for a lens system with triple lenses ( @xmath28 ) ,",
    "the lens equation becomes a tenth order polynomial and it is still numerically solvable . for these lens systems , there are a maximum of ten images and a minimum of four images , and the number of images changes by a multiple of two as the source crosses a caustic . unlike the caustics of a binary lens system forming separate sets of closed curves ,",
    "those of a triple lens system can exhibit self - intersection and nesting .    13.0 cm    for lens systems with even larger number of lenses ( @xmath29 ) , numerically solving the lens equation becomes very difficult .",
    "however , one can still obtain the magnification patterns of these lens systems by using the inverse ray - shooting technique @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a large number of light rays are uniformly shot backwards from the observer plane through the lens plane and then collected ( binned ) in the source plane .",
    "then , the magnification pattern is obtained by the ratio of the surface brightness ( i.e. , the number of rays per unit area ) on the source plane to that on the observer plane .",
    "then the light curve resulting from a particular source trajectory corresponds to the one - dimensional cut through the constructed magnification pattern .",
    "this technique has an advantage of allowing one to construct magnification patterns regardless of the number of lenses , but it has a disadvantage of requiring large computation time to obtain smooth magnification patterns .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the light curve anomalies induced by multiple planets are well approximated by the superposition of those of the single planet lens systems where the individual planet - primary pairs act as independent lens systems .",
    "as pointed out by gaudi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , then , the anomaly pattern in the central region caused by one of the planets can be significantly affected by the existence of other planet(s ) because the central deviation regions caused by the individual planets occur in this same region . however , the anomaly pattern in the outer deviation region caused by each planet is hardly affected by other planet(s ) because the outer deviation regions of the individual planets occur , in general , at different locations .",
    "the fact that the anomaly patterns in the outer deviation regions are scarcely affected by other planet(s ) provides a new channel to search for multiple planets and to determine their parameters . in this channel ,",
    "multiple planets are detected when the source trajectory passes both of the outer deviation regions around the planetary caustics of the individual planets .",
    "the greatest advantage of this method over the method of monitoring high magnification events is that one can unambiguously identify the existence of multiple planets from the unique pattern of consecutive anomalies and accurately determine the planet parameters due to the applicability of much simpler single planet lensing models to the individual anomalies .",
    "in this section , we illustrate that the efficiency of detecting multiple planets through the new channel will be substantial . to demonstrate this",
    ", we estimate the probability of successively detecting lensing light curve anomalies induced by multiple planets . the probability is determined for a lens system having two jovian - mass planets ( i.e.  jupiter and saturn ) orbiting a host star with a mass of @xmath30 .",
    "then , the mass ratios of the planets ( to that of the host star ) are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , for the jupiter - mass and the saturn - mass planets , respectively .",
    "if the lens system is located located at @xmath33 kpc ( and with a source at @xmath34 kpc ) and the component planets have intrinsic orbital separations similar to those of jupiter and saturn of our solar system , the orbital separations ( normalized by @xmath7 ) of the planets correspond to @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .    to estimate the probability , we first construct maps of magnification excess .",
    "the magnification excess is defined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the magnifications expected with and without the planets , respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows the constructed map when the projected separations of the individual planets are @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the angle between the position vectors to the planets fro the host star ( orientation angle ) is @xmath42 .",
    "we note that the projected separation , @xmath43 , is related to the intrinsic orbital separation , @xmath44 , by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the phase angle and @xmath47 is the inclination of the orbital plane .",
    "once the map is constructed , the probability is estimated by computing the ratio of events whose source trajectories pass both of the outer deviation regions induced by the individual planets ( for example , the event resulting from the source trajectory designated by ` 1 ' in fig .",
    "1 ) during the measurements to the total number of trial events . for given lens positions ,",
    "the source trajectory orientations ( with respect to the jupiter - primary axis ) and the impact parameter ( with respect to the primary ) of the trial events are randomly selected in the ranges of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "measurements for each event are assumed to be carried out during @xmath50 with a frequency of 10 times / night , which corresponds to that of the current microlensing followup observations @xcite .",
    "we consider each planet is detected if excesses greater than a threshold value of @xmath51 are consecutively detected more than 5 times during the measurements .",
    "since we are interested in anomalies occurred only in the outer deviation regions , we do not count the detections of anomalies occurred in the central deviations region ( the region enclosed by the solid circle around the primary with a radius @xmath52 ) . in addition , since identifying the existence of both planets and determining their parameters will be difficult if both of the planets outer deviation regions are located at a similar place due to the resulting complexity of the interfered pattern of anomalies , we also do not count detections if the time interval between the anomalies induced by the individual anomalies is shorter than @xmath53 .",
    "6.8 cm    in figure 2 , we present the distribution of the _ absolute _ probabilities of detecting both planets as functions of their projected separations , @xmath54 .",
    "the presented probabilities are the values averaged over the random orientation angles in the range of @xmath55 . in figure 3",
    ", we also present the distribution of _ conditional _ probabilities to successively detect the second planet under the condition that the first planet is detected , @xmath56 .",
    "one finds that if the two planets are located in the lensing zone , detecting both of them is possible with absolute probabilities of @xmath57 .",
    "one also finds that once a planet is detected , the probabilities to successively detect the second one are @xmath58 .",
    "we propose a new channel of detecting extra - solar systems composed of having multiple planets by using microlensing . in this method ,",
    "multiple planets are detected when the source trajectory passes both of the outer regions of deviations induced by the individual planets . from the estimation of the probabilities to detect both planets of an example galactic lens system composed of two jovian - mass planets around a star with @xmath30",
    ", we find that if they are located within the lensing zone , both planets can be detected with a non - negligible absolute probabilities ( @xmath59 ) and a substantial conditional probabilities ( @xmath60 ) of successively detecting the second planet under the condition that the first planet is detected .",
    "the proposed method has an important advantage of allowing one to accurately determine the planet parameters because the light curve anomalies induced by the individual planets can be well described by simple single planet lensing models ."
