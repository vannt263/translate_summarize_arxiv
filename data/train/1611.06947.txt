    "news media censorship is generally defined as a restriction on freedom of speech to prohibit access to public information , and is taking place more than ever before . according to the freedom of the press report , 40.4 percent of nations fit into the `` free '' category in 2003 . by 2014 , this global percentage fell to 32 percent  @xcite , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "more than 200 journalists were jailed in 2014 , according to the committee to protect journalists .",
    "in fact , in the past three years , more than 200 journalists have been jailed annually @xcite .        although the social and political aspects of news media censorship have been deeply discussed and analyzed in the field of social sciences  @xcite ,",
    "there is currently no efficient and effective approach to automatically detect and track such censorship events in real time .",
    "different from the task of internet censorship detection in which a collection of labeled data ( e.g. , deleted posts or blogs in social media websites ) can be collected to support supervised learning  @xcite , the detection of censorship in news media often has no labeled data available for training , and must rely on unsupervised techniques instead .    in this paper",
    ", we present a novel unsupervised approach that views social media as a sensor to detect censorship in news media wherein statistically significant differences between information published in the news media and the correlated information published in social media are automatically identified as candidate censored events .",
    "a generalized log - likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) statistic can then be formulated for hypothesis testing , and the problem of censorship detection can be cast as the maximization of the glrt statistic over all possible clusters of keywords .",
    "we propose to identify the highest scoring clusters as indicators of censorship events in the local news media , and further apply randomization testing to estimate the statistical significances of these clusters .",
    "we consider the detection of censorship in the news media of two countries , mexico and venezuela , and utilize twitter as the uncensored source .    starting in january 2012",
    ", a `` country - withheld content '' policy has been launched by twitter , with which governments are able to request withholding and deletion of user accounts and tweets @xcite . at the same time , twitter started to release a transparency report , which provided worldwide information and removal requests for user accounts and tweets @xcite .",
    "the transparency report lists information and removal requests from year 2012 to 2015 on a half - year basis .",
    "table [ table : transparency_report ] summarizes the information and removal requests for year 2014 on nine countries of interest .",
    "as shown in table [ table : transparency_report ] , we can see although all of these countries have ever issued account information requests , most of them did not intend to remove or withhold contents on twitter , including mexico and venezuela . therefore , we believe that twitter can be considered as a reliable and uncensored source to detect censorship events in these two countries .",

    "this is the first unsupervised framework for automatic detection of censorship events in news media . *",
    "* optimization algorithms * : the inference of our proposed framework involves the maximization of a glrt statistic function over all clusters of co - occurrend keywords , which is hard to solve in general .",
    "we propose a novel approximation algorithm to solve this problem in nearly linear time . * * extensive experiments to validate the proposed techniques * : we conduct comprehensive experiments on real - world twitter and local news articles datasets to evaluate our proposed approach .",
    "the results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing techniques in the accuracy of censorship detection .",
    "in addition , we perform case studies on the censorship patterns detected by our proposed approach and analyze the reasons behind censorship from real - world data of mexico and venezuela during year 2014 .",

    "<S> censorship in social media has been well studied and provides insight into how governments stifle freedom of expression online . </S>",

    "<S> we present a novel unsupervised approach that views social media as a sensor to detect censorship in news media wherein statistically significant differences between information published in the news media and the correlated information published in social media are automatically identified as candidate censored events . </S>",
