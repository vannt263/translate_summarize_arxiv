    "l and t dwarf companions to nearby stars are valuable for studying the structure and evolution of brown dwarfs as well as their origin .",
    "because the ages and metallicities of these companions often can be determined via their primaries , they can be used to calibrate atmospheric and evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , theories for the formation of brown dwarfs can be tested with measurements of the fraction of stars that harbor wide low - mass companions and the frequency of tight binaries among these companions @xcite .",
    "multiple strategies have been employed in identifying cool companions to stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "one approach is to define a sample of stars and search for companions to them @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can begin with a sample of known brown dwarfs and check whether they are companions to stars @xcite .",
    "late - type companions also can be uncovered through a search for pairs of comoving objects across a large area of sky @xcite .",
    "proper motion measurements are essential in all of these strategies , either for the initial identification of candidate companions or for confirming candidates that were selected through photometry . these proper motions can be measured through dedicated imaging or archival data from wide - field surveys like the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the united kingdom infrared telescope infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , * ? ? ?",
    "a new source of astrometry has recently become available via the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , * ? ? ?",
    "this mission has performed the first all - sky survey at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths since 2mass , thus providing an opportunity to measure proper motions for 2mass sources across the entire sky .",
    "indeed , proper motions incorporating wise data have already been exploited for searching for free - floating l and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we have begun a search for faint common proper motion companions to nearby stars using astrometry from 2mass and wise . in this paper , we report the discovery of a substellar companion to the solar - type star hd  46588 .",
    "we describe the methods that uncovered this object as a possible companion (   [ sec : search ] ) and present spectroscopy that confirms its cool nature (   [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "we then examine the physical properties of this new companion (   [ sec : prop ] ) and discuss its relevance to studies of l and t dwarfs (   [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "between 1997 and 2001 , the 2mass telescopes collected images of the entire sky in broad - band filters centered at 1.25 , 1.65 , and 2.16  ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in 2010 ,",
    "the wise satellite mapped the sky at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22  ( w1w4 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the typical magnitudes that correspond to snr=5 for 2mass and wise are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , w1=16.5 , w2=15.5 , w3=11.2 , and w4=7.9 in unconfused areas of sky and ( for wise ) in the ecliptic .",
    "wise achieves better sensitivity at higher ecliptic latitudes because of greater depth of coverage .",
    "given these photometric limits and the near- and mid - ir colors of l and t dwarfs @xcite , a survey that requires detections in both 2mass and wise will be limited by the sensitivity of 2mass at @xmath4 .",
    "the astrometric precision of 2mass is slightly less than @xmath10 for snr@xmath1110 and approaches @xmath12 at the detection limit @xcite . for wise ,",
    "the precision is @xmath12 for brighter sources ( w1@xmath13 ) and approaches @xmath14 in declination for some of the fainter objects because of an error in the preliminary data processing . given the elapsed time of @xmath15 years between 2mass and wise , proper motions measured from their astrometry should have accuracies of @xmath16% at brighter magnitudes for @xmath17  yr@xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we have considered for our survey all known main sequence stars , white dwarfs , and brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood with proper motions exceeding this threshold ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to search for possible late - type companions to a given primary ,",
    "we begin by retrieving lists of coordinates and photometry for all objects within a radius of @xmath19 that appear in the 2mass point source catalog and the wise preliminary release source catalog .",
    "we match the two lists to identify pairs of 2mass and wise sources whose astrometric offsets correspond to the expected motion of the primary based on its known proper motion . to be considered a candidate companion ,",
    "we also require that an object s colors and magnitudes ( or limits ) from 2mass and wise are consistent with those of m , l , and t dwarfs at the distance of the primary . to characterize the colors of the latter",
    ", we retrieved photometry from the 2mass and wise catalogs for late - type dwarfs that have known distances ( * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) .",
    "this process typically produces @xmath20 candidate companions for most primaries .",
    "stars that have low galactic latitudes or small proper motions can have dozens of candidates .",
    "we then visually inspect the 2mass and wise images to identify and reject false candidates , which often consist of one component of a resolved pair of 2mass sources matched to an unresolved blend of the pair in wise .    through our analysis of the 2mass and",
    "wise data for nearby stars , we have identified a new companion to the f7v star hd  46588 . the companion is designated as 2mass j06462756 + 7935045 and wisep j064627.10 + 793457.8 , and we refer to it as hd  46588  b. it has a projected separation of @xmath21 , corresponding to 1420  au at the distance of the primary ( 17.9  pc , * ? ? ?",
    "we show 2mass and wise images of the pair in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the agreement between the motions of hd  46588  a and b is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : pm ] , where we plot the differences in equatorial coordinates between 2mass and wise for all stars within a radius of @xmath19 and with w2 uncertainties less than 0.1  mag . for stars that have w2 fluxes within @xmath22  mag of hd  46588  b ,",
    "the standard deviations of the differences in right ascension and declination are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the colors and magnitudes of hd  46588  b from 2mass and wise are consistent with those of a cool dwarf at the distance of the primary , as illustrated in the color - magnitude diagrams in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the colors of hd  46588  b suggest that it is near the boundary between l and t dwarfs .",
    "to confirm its cool nature , we obtained a near - ir spectrum of hd  46588  b with the triplespec spectrograph @xcite on the palomar 5-m hale telescope on the night of 2011 may 12 .",
    "triplespec produces spectra that extend from 12.4  and have a resolution of 2700 .",
    "we collected eight 5  min exposures of hd  46588  b in an abba dither pattern along the slit ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we also observed hd  45560 ( a1v ) to provide telluric correction .",
    "the slit was aligned to the parallactic angle for these observations .",
    "we reduced the data with a version of the spextool package @xcite that has been modified for use with data from triplespec ( m. cushing , private communication ) .",
    "this software corrects for telluric absorption with the methods described by @xcite .",
    "we present the reduced spectrum of hd  46588  b in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "it exhibits strong absorption bands from h@xmath26o , which confirms that it is a cool object . to measure its spectral type , we compared the spectrum of hd  46588  b to data from the spex prism spectral librariesadam / browndwarfs / spexpris ] for l and t dwarf standards @xcite . although the metallicity of hd  46588 appears to be subsolar ( fe / h=@xmath270.21 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is only @xmath28  dex below the mean value for stars in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "thus , normal dwarf standards should be suitable for the classification of hd  46588  b. for comparison to the standards , the spectrum of hd  46588  b was smoothed to the same resolution as the spex data ( r@xmath29100 ) .",
    "we find that hd  46588  b closely resembles standards with a near - ir spectral type of l9 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "this classification is consistent with that expected based on its photometry ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "our proper motion measurements and spectroscopy have demonstrated the companionship of hd  46588  b. therefore , it should have the same distance , age , and metallicity as its primary . in table",
    "[ tab : data ] , we list previous measurements and estimates of these parameters for hd  46588 . to estimate the bolometric luminosity of hd  46588  b , we converted its 2mass @xmath6 magnitude to the mauna kea observatory ( mko ) photometric system @xcite and applied a bolometric correction of bc@xmath30 @xcite , the distance of the primary , and the absolute bolometric magnitude for the sun ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we arrive at a value of log  @xmath32 . based on this luminosity and the age of the primary",
    ", we estimate masses of @xmath33  @xmath3 and @xmath34  @xmath3 from the evolutionary models of @xcite and @xcite , respectively ( see figure  [ fig : models ] ) .",
    "both of these estimates are fully below the hydrogen burning mass limit ( @xmath35  @xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that hd  46588  b is probably a brown dwarf . to encompass both ranges of masses ,",
    "we adopt a mass of @xmath2  @xmath3 .",
    "these models imply an effective temperature of @xmath36  k , which agrees with previous estimates for late l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the photometric , astrometric , and physical properties of hd  46588  b are summarized in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "we note that the wise preliminary release source catalog contains an additional photometric measurement in w3 , but the detection is marginal .",
    "the companion is not detected in w4 .",
    "we have presented the discovery of a widely - separated l9 companion to the nearby f7v star hd  46588 . among previously known companions ,",
    "gl584  c most closely resembles hd  46588  b in terms of the spectral types of the system components ( g1/g3/l8 , * ? ? ?",
    "other late - l / early - t companions to stars include gl337  cd ( t0 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , hd  203030  b ( l7.5 , * ? ? ?",

    "brown dwarfs near the l / t transition have served as laboratories for studying the complex atmospheric changes that occur between l and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "observations of binaries have played a central role in these studies .",
    "for instance , systems with spectral types of late l or early t appear to have a high binary fraction compared to other types @xcite .",
    "this has been explained by rapid evolution of brown dwarfs through the l / t transition , which causes single transition objects to be rare and binaries containing earlier and later types to dominate systems that have composite types near the l / t boundary @xcite .",
    "these binaries often appear overluminous relative to other brown dwarfs at the same color or spectral type .",
    "hd  46588  b is somewhat overluminous in @xmath37 vs.  @xmath38 but appears near the lower envelope of the l / t dwarf sequence in @xmath37 vs.  @xmath39 ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "thus , it does not show clear evidence of binarity . regardless of whether it is single or binary , since its distance is known , hd  46588  b offers an opportunity to better constrain the relations between spectral type and absolute magnitudes ( e.g. , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) near the l / t transition , which influence the modeling of binary statistics and surface densities of l / t objects as well as the identification of overluminous systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , because of its companionship to a star , hd  46588  b has the best available age estimate of any known object at a spectral type of l9 . by combining its age and luminosity with evolutionary models ,",
    "we have been able to estimate its temperature , and thus constrain the temperature of the l / t boundary .",
    "the available measurements of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and temperature for hd  46588  b are consistent with those derived previously for companions with ages of @xmath111  gyr @xcite , but these relations could be more tightly constrained by improving the accuracy of near - ir photometry for hd  46588  b.    data from the wise mission have been recently used to identify new free - floating late - type members of the solar neighborhood based on their colors @xcite and proper motions @xcite .",
    "our discovery of hd  46588  b illustrates the added value of wise for uncovering cool companions to nearby stars via their proper motions .",
