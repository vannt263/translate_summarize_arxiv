    "from isotopic studies of meteorites it is known that the solar nebula contained at least a dozen different short - lived radionuclides , or slrs ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "identification of the sources of these slrs could greatly constrain the sun s birth environment and processes acting during star formation .",
    "the half - lives of some of these isotopes are shorter than the timescales @xmath1 typically associated with star formation , so they must have been produced near the time and place of the sun s formation .",
    "the slrs @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in particular , can not have been inherited from the sun s molecular cloud in abundances consistent with ongoing galactic nucleosynthesis , and must have been late additions @xcite . a leading candidate for the source of these and other slrs is one or more core - collapse supernovae in the sun s birth environment , contaminating either its molecular cloud @xcite , or its protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "another leading candidate is production of slrs by irradiation ( by solar cosmic rays , essentially ) , within the solar nebula @xcite .",
    "because this latter mechanism by itself is inadequate to explain the abundance of @xmath3 in the early solar system @xcite , it is generally accepted that the source of @xmath3 is core - collapse supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is not clear whether the source of @xmath3 is a single , nearby supernova , or many ( possibly distant ) supernovae ( as in * ?",
    "the origins of the other slrs are also debated . a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2",
    "has been observed in meteorites , demanding a common source for these two isotopes _ after _ the formation of the solar nebula , as in the so called  late - injection \" hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear whether these two slrs are correlated with @xmath3 .",
    "if evidence for a corelation could be found , this would strongly suggest that @xmath0 and @xmath2 were injected by the same supernova or supernovae that injected @xmath3 .",
    "the lack of such evidence , though , leaves open the possibility that @xmath0 and @xmath2 were created by irradiation within the solar nebula while @xmath3 was injected separately by one or more supernovae , into the sun s molecular cloud or protoplanetary disk .",
    "the abundances of the slrs alone have not yet enabled a discrimination between these possibilities , but ( * ? ? ? * hereafter gm07 ) have proposed that the oxygen isotopic ratios of early solar system materials may be used to rule out certain hypotheses .",
    "specifically , they argue that if @xmath0 and @xmath2 were injected by a nearby supernova into the sun s protoplanetary disk , sufficient to produce the observed meteoritic ratio @xmath4 @xcite , then the oxygen isotopic ratio of the solar nebula would be considerably altered : solar nebula materials formed before the injection would have oxygen isotopic ratios _ significantly _ different from later - formed materials . gm07 calculated the shifts in oxygen isotopic ratios accompanying injection of supernova @xmath0 into the sun s protoplanetary disk , using the isotopic yields in bulk supernova ejecta calculated by @xcite .",
    "a robust prediction of the gm07 models is that @xmath5 of pre - injection materials should be significantly higher , by several percent , than post - injection materials .",
    "examples of pre - injection materials may exist in meteorites , or especially in the solar wind sample returned by the @xmath6 mission @xcite .",
    "since preliminary results from _ genesis _ suggest the sun is _ not _ isotopically heavy in oxygen @xcite , and because no such @xmath7-rich ( or @xmath8-poor ) components have been discovered in meteorites , gm07 rule out a supernova origin for the @xmath0 and @xmath2 in meteorites .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to reproduce and refine the method pioneered by gm07 , and to test the conclusion that @xmath0 can not have a supernova origin . gm07",
    "originally considered only bulk ejecta of spherically symmetric supernova explosions .",
    "we begin our analysis with this case , but make necessary refinements to the method , and use our current nucleosynthesis models to predict the isotopic yields .",
    "we then expand on the analysis of gm07 , calculating the isotopic yields by allowing the disk to intercept ejecta from different parts of the supernova explosion rather than a uniformly mixed total yield , and by examining anisotropic explosions .",
    "we also simultaneously consider the injection of @xmath9 into the disk .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we outline the method used to calculate shifts in oxygen isotopic composition due to supernova injection of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , including updates to the method of gm07 . in ",
    "3 we describe the results of nucleosynthesis simulations we have carried out , to determine the isotopic yields in supernova ejecta under various explosion scenarios . we determine the inputs needed to compute the shifts in solar nebula oxygen isotopic composition .",
    "these shifts in oxygen isotope before and after injection are presented in  4 , and in  5 we draw conclusions .",
    "the method of gm07 is fairly straightforward .",
    "they assume that meteoritic components that sample the solar nebula s starting composition , _ before _ the acquisition of @xmath10 , can be identified and measured .",
    "likewise , they assume samples _ after _ the acquisition of @xmath10 can be identified and measured . any difference in the oxygen isotopic content between samples of those two groups",
    "would then constitute a shift in oxygen isotopes brought about by the injection of supernova material . the preditced shift in oxygen isotopes due to injection of supernova material into the protoplanetary disk",
    "can then be compared to the actual difference in oxygen isotopes before and after . in practice , because the vast majority of meteoritic components sample the solar nebula after injection , gm07 assumed a  final \" value for the solar nebula oxygen isotopes , and used the isotopic yields in supernova ejecta to predict the initial composition . testing",
    "the supernova injection hypothesis thus amounts to finding meteoritic inclusions with this initial oxygen isotopic composition .",
    "such inclusions should have evidence for no live @xmath10 at the time of their formation , and should be among the oldest meteoritic inclusions .",
    "the earliest - formed solids in the solar system are widely accepted to be the calcium - rich , aluminum - rich inclusions ( cais ) , both because they contain minerals that are the first solids expected to condense in a cooling solar nebula @xcite , and because their pb - pb ages are the oldest measured , at 4568.6 myr @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that because many of the minerals in cais are condensates , their isotopic composition should reflect that of the solar nebula gas .",
    "the vast majority of cais have inferred initial ratios @xmath4 or appear to have been isotopically reset at a later date @xcite . only in a handful of cais known as  fun \" cais ( fractionation with unknown nuclear effects )",
    "has it been possible to set firm upper limits on the initial @xmath11 ratio and show these cais did not contain live @xmath0 when they formed @xcite .",
    "thus , cais overall reflect the composition of the solar nebula at an early time , and fun cais possibly record the oxygen isotopic abundance before the solar nebula acquired @xmath0 .    to make more precise statements , it is necessary to quantify the oxygen isotopic composition of the nebula and various components .",
    "the molar fraction of oxygen in gas and rock can vary , so the relevant quantities are the ratios of the stable oxygen isotopes , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the field of cosmochemistry , these ratios are commonly expressed as deviations from a standard , in this case standard mean ocean water ( smow ) , which has @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the fractional deviations of the isotopic ratios from these standard values are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and are measured in parts per thousand , or",
    " permil \" ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "[ that is , @xmath19 . ]",
    "it is also standard to report the quantity @xmath20 , because this quantity is conserved during almost all chemical fractionation processes .",
    "[ more precisely , @xmath21 @xcite . ]",
    "it is clear that the final oxygen isotopic composition of the nebula , @xmath22 , will depend on its starting composition @xmath23 , the composition of the supernova material , @xmath24 , and the mass of supernova material injected ( relative to the mass of the disk ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the isotopic ratio of the supernova material injected into the disk , and @xmath27 measures the mass of injected oxygen relative to the oxygen present in the disk ( with a similar formula applying to @xmath28 ) . in terms of the masses involved ,",
    "@xmath29 most of these terms are defineable .",
    "first , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the time delay between supernova injection and isotopic closure of the meteoritic materials , and @xmath32 is the mean lifetime of @xmath0 . by definition , @xmath33 @xmath34 , because sufficient @xmath0 must be injected to yield the meteoritic ratio .",
    "finally , the isotopic abundances in the solar nebula are known ( the ratio @xmath35 is taken from @xcite ) , so we derive @xmath36_{\\rm sn } } \\ , \\exp ( + \\delta t / \\tau).\\ ] ] note that @xmath37 is independent of the mass of the disk , but it increases with @xmath31 , since larger values of @xmath31 imply that more supernova material had to be injected to yield the same @xmath11 ratio , thereby implying larger isotopic shifts in oxygen associated with this injection .    besides the time delay @xmath31 , the major inputs needed to infer @xmath23 are the isotopic composition @xmath24 and ratio of @xmath8 to @xmath10 in the supernova ejecta , and the oxygen isotopic composition of the post - injection solar nebula .",
    "gm07 used bulk abundances of supernova ejecta calculated by @xcite for the first set of quantities .",
    "they also assumed that the oxygen isotopic ratios of the post - injection solar nebula matched the smow values of the present - day earth : @xmath38 .",
    "this assumption is the main reason why they concluded that the pre - injection solar nebula had to be @xmath7-rich , as we now demonstrate . rearranging equation  [ eq : shift ] yields",
    "@xmath39 supernova ejecta tend to be @xmath8-rich ; in the extreme limit , @xmath40 . if @xmath41 also , then @xmath42 .",
    "that is , @xmath43 is inferred to have been positive and potentially quite large if @xmath44 .",
    "the isotopic yields of the supernova ejecta computed by @xcite were consistent with such large values of @xmath37 and @xmath45 , leading gm07 to conclude that generally @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , for progenitor masses @xmath47 , gm07 inferred @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "since there are no early - formed meteoritic components with @xmath50 this high , and because the oxygen isotopic composition of the sun appears to be consistent with @xmath51 @xcite , gm07 ruled out supernova injection of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion depends on a few key assumptions that we update below .",
    "we consider the starting composition of the solar nebula , and take into account the non - homogeneity of supernova ejecta .",
    "oxygen isotopic ratios potentially can test or rule out the supernova injection hypothesis , but several caveats must be applied to the method of gm07 .",
    "the first and most important correction involves the oxygen isotopic composition of the solar nebula immediately before and after the injection of supernova material .",
    "gm07 assumed the post - injection composition was equal to smow ; however , smow is widely understood _ not _ to reflect the oxygen isotopic ratios of the solar nebula immediately after injection . on a three - isotope diagram of @xmath16 versus @xmath17 , the oxygen isotopes of planetary and meteoritic materials are arrayed along a mixing line called the carbonaceous chondrite anhydrous mineral ( ccam ) line discovered by @xcite . after correcting for isotopic fractionation by thermal and chemical processes , @xcite inferred a mixing line with slope 1.0 in the three - isotope diagram , and so we will refer to this mixing line as the  slope-1 \" line .",
    "today the oxygen isotopic composition of the earth ( smow ) is widely recognized to reflect a mixture of an isotopically lighter rocky component ( to which cais belong ) , and an isotopically heavy reservoir ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is very likely that this component is isotopically heavy water , with @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the existence of isotopically heavy water is supported by the discovery ( in the primitive carbonaceous chondrite acfer 094 ) of a poorly characterized product of aqueous alteration , with @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "quite possibly this heavy water is the result of a mass - dependent photodissociation of co in the outer solar nebula by an external ultraviolet source @xcite .",
    "the photodissociation can be isotopically selective because the different isotopologues of co molecules can self - shield ; @xmath54 and @xmath55 are optically thin and dissociate more completely , releasing @xmath7 and @xmath56 atoms that react with @xmath57 to form isotopically heavy water , while the abundant molecule @xmath58 is more optically thick and does not as completely dissociate .",
    "the light co molecule is eventually lost with the nebular gas .",
    "whatever the source of the isotopically heavy component , smow only represents a late stage in nebular evolution , and does not represent the state of the nebula immediately after injection of supernova material .",
    "applying the same reasoning , it is likely that the starting composition of the solar nebula was lower ( more @xmath8-enriched ) on the slope-1 line than most cais .",
    "the majority of cais tend to cluster near @xmath59 @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; but many of the most primitive and unaltered cais cluster near @xmath62 @xmath63 , or @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "likewise , @xcite report @xmath65 for  mineralogically pristine \" cais .",
    "cais also contain grains of hibonite , spinel , and corundum , which are among the first minerals expected to condense from a cooling gas of solar composition @xcite , and which are presumably even more primitive than cais themselves .",
    "@xcite report that hibonite grains are also found to cluster near @xmath66 , or @xmath67 , while @xcite observed 4 hibonite grains from allende and semarkona to have oxygen isotopes in the range @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "they also found that spinel grains from the cv chondrite allende had @xmath70 , and that corundum grains from the cm chondrite semarkona clustered strongly in the range @xmath71 .",
    "@xcite likewise report @xmath71 for primitive cais and amoeboid olivine aggregates , which are also believed to have condensed from solar nebula gas . from these results",
    "we infer that @xmath72 in the solar nebula immediately after the injection of supernova material .",
    "meteoritic and other samples also constrain the initial ( pre - injection ) oxygen isotopic composition of the solar nebula , and find it to be very similar . as described above ,",
    "very firm and low upper limits to initial @xmath11 exist for fun cais that mark them as having formed before the injection of @xmath0 and @xmath2 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have identified a fractionation line associated with the fun cais with @xmath73 that passes through @xmath74 .",
    "presumably the original isotopic composition of the nebula matched that of the sun , which might therefore be measured by _",
    "mission @xcite .",
    "preliminary measurements can be interpreted as clustering on a fractionation line with @xmath75 @xcite , which would intersect the slope-1 line at @xmath76 , and other analyses suggest @xmath77 [ @xmath78 errors ] @xcite .    from these results",
    "it seems likely that the original solar nebula oxygen isotopic composition was near the _ genesis _ preliminary result of @xmath79 , or possibly much lower along the slope-1 line .",
    "subsequent reaction of rock with a @xmath8-depleted reservoir then moved material along the slope-1 line to @xmath59 @xmath60 , where most cais are found ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "fun cais appear to represent an intermediate stage in this process , only partially evolved along the slope-1 line . to fix values",
    ", we will simply assume the solar system protoplanetary disk isotopic ratios started as @xmath80 .",
    "the above discussion changes the criterion by which one can reject the supernova injection hypothesis .",
    "because gm07 assumed an initial solar nebula composition near smow , they concluded that pre - injection samples necessarily would have had @xmath81 , and the lack of such samples in meteorites ruled out the hypothesis .",
    "but we assert that the supernova injection hypothesis can be ruled out only if injection of supernova material necessarily shift the oxygen isotopic composition of the solar nebula from a composition near @xmath82 to one far off the slope-1 line , or one on the slope-1 line but with @xmath83 . in this way",
    ", the gm07 method of using oxygen isotopic constraints might still allow a test of the supernova injection hypothesis .",
    "there are at least three scenarios wherein the shift in oxygen isotopes following injection of supernova material can be consistent with the above constraints . from equation  [ eq : shift ]",
    ", it is seen that even if the supernova ejecta and the protoplanetary disk differ in oxygen isotopic composition by hundreds of permil , the shift in oxygen isotopes may be small ( @xmath84 permil ) if the injected mass is small , so that @xmath85 . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath0 and the other slrs are injected by a supernova into the solar nebula disk , then the magnitude of the shift in oxygen isotopes will depend on the fraction of ejecta oxygen that accompanies al .",
    "in this first scenario , o and al may be significantly fractionated during delivery of the ejecta to the solar nebula .",
    "for example , @xcite find that effectively only material condensed from the supernova ejecta into large ( @xmath86 radius ) grains can be injected directly into a protoplanetary disk . in the extreme event that the only grains that entered the protoplanetary disk were corundum ( @xmath87 ) grains , the isotopic shifts in oxygen would be negligible ( @xmath88 ) . or , if only 10% of the oxygen in the ejecta condensed into grains , and 90% remained in gas that was excluded from the disk , then the isotopic shifts in oxygen isotope ( for a given amount of injected @xmath0 ) would be 10 times smaller than predicted by gm07 .",
    "it is therefore not possible to determine the shifts in oxygen isotopes following injection into a disk without quantifying the degree to which o and al are fractionated between gas and solids . in what follows ,",
    "we assume no fractionation , as such a calculation is beyond the scope of the present investigation ; but we consider dust condensation in supernova ejecta to be a very important effect , one that potentially could significantly reduce the predicted isotopic shifts .    in the second scenario , the shifts in oxygen isotopes could also remain small if the injected material was simply higher than expected in @xmath0 ( or lower in o ) , so that again @xmath85 .",
    "the calculations of gm07 relied on the _ bulk _ abundances calculated by @xcite .",
    "that is , gm07 assumed that the injected material uniformly sampled the entirety of the supernova ejecta .",
    "such a uniform sampling is unlikely , as supernovae often do explode in a clumpy fashion and asymmetrically .",
    "it has long been understood that asymmetries or hydrodynamic instabilities may disrupt the stratification of the progenitor star , but they do not result in large scale compositional mixing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray elemental maps of the cassiopeia a supernova remnant @xcite dramatically demonstrate that massive stars are likely to explode as thousands of clumps of material , each sampling different burning zones within the progenitor .",
    "@xcite have argued that this may be a near - universal feature of core - collapse supernovae ; at the very least , observations do not rule out this possibility .",
    "so it is more than possible that the solar nebula received materials from only limited regions within the ejecta in which the @xmath89 ratio could have varied considerably from the average value for the ejecta .",
    "the non - uniformity of the @xmath89 ratio may be magnified if the star explodes asymmetrically , allowing explosive nucleosynthesis to proceed differently even in parcels of gas in the same burning zone .",
    "finally , in the third scenario by which isotopic shifts may conform to measurements , @xmath37 need not be small , and the isotopic shifts may approach @xmath90 in magnitude , so long as the injection moved the composition _ up _ the slope-1 line by @xmath91 ( i.e. , the change in @xmath16 equalled the change in @xmath17 , both being @xmath92 ) , or _ down _",
    "the slope-1 line by a comparable or even larger amount .",
    "a shift from an initial composition @xmath93 , consistent with @xmath6 measurements of the sun s composition , to @xmath94 , consistent with primitive meteoritic components , would not conflict with the data .",
    "alternatively , a shift from an initial composition @xmath93 , to @xmath95 , or even @xmath96 , followed by mixing with the @xmath8-poor reservoir that moves solar nebula solids up the slope-1 line , would also conform to the data .    in the next section",
    "we compute the isotopic yields in core - collapse supernovae of various progenitor masses , both in spherically symmetric explosions ( as considered by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and asymmetric explosions .",
    "these calculations allow us to predict the oxygen isotopic composition @xmath24 and the ratio @xmath37 of the supernova material at various locations within the explosion , to assess the range of possible isotopic shifts under the second and third scenarios .",
    "a supernova injection scenario would be ruled out , _ unless _ either the injection of material results in small overall shifts ( i.e. the injected material contains a high   abundance relative to oxygen , or vice versa , a low oxygen abundance relative to al ) , or the oxygen isotopes are shifted along the slope-1 line , in which case shifts of up to @xmath9710 permil in either direction are allowed .",

    "the freezeout from the expansion limits the processing of these isotopes into heavier species , so the 3d explosion is richer in these isotopes than the 1d simulation .",

    "thus it depends sensitively on how much   is present once nuclear burning shuts off , which in turn depends sensitively on the trajectories taken by the gas . at low temperatures the classical decay reaction @xmath137 completely dominates , but at high temperatures ( above @xmath138 ) , and low proton density ,",
    "another decay channel opens up for @xmath139 , and it can decay also via @xmath140 @xcite",
    ". the branching ratio of these two reactions is very sensitive to temperature at around @xmath141 k , with higher temperatures overwhelmingly favoring the decay to @xmath142 .",
    "the amount of   remaining at the end of burning is highly dependent on the time taken to drop below that temperature , and the density evolution , as high entropies favor the destruction over the synthesis .",
    "because of the power law drop off , the density in the 1d calculations stayed higher for a longer period of time , as compared to the 3d calculation , thus isotopes had a longer time window in which they could be processed to higher species .",
    "the density of the 3d calculation dropped faster due to the increased velocities of particles to create the asymmetry , so the nuclear burning shut off earlier , and more isotopes like , , or   survived the nucleosynthesis of the explosion .",
    "this results in a substantial variation in the @xmath135 abundance between the 1d and the 3d calculation , and that same effect ( i.e. how quickly the density drops ) is also responsible for the variation in abundance of particles in the ring and the bubble by the end of the 3d simulation .    in the 1d simulations the full decay of all after the explosion was calculated in the reaction network .",

    "as described in  2 , the initial composition of the solar nebula was probably close to @xmath146 , and we adopt this as the starting value .",
    "based on the numerical simulations of  3 , we have calculated the ratios @xmath37 and the isotopic abundances @xmath24 within the ejecta overall , and within the regions where @xmath0 is produced .",

    "we carried out stellar nucleosynthesis calculations , to calculate the isotopic yields of @xmath0 , @xmath2 and oxygen isotopes in a variety of supernova explosion scenarios , including the 1d ( spherically symmetric ) cases as well as 3d ( asymmetric ) explosions . because @xmath0 and @xmath2 are observed to be correlated @xcite , we also simultaneously considered injection of @xmath2 into the solar nebula .",
    "we then computed the shifts in oxygen isotopes and the final @xmath290 ratio in the solar nebula following injection of sufficient supernova material to produce the meteoritic ratio @xmath353 .",
    "our 1d simulations largely confirm the results of gm07 , that isotopic shifts are likely to be tens of permil and to make the solar nebula more @xmath8-rich than before the injection .",
    "we found that injection of material from either the bulk or the explosive c / ne burning and sub - explosive c burning regions of supernovae moved the composition of the solar nebula down the slope 1 line .",
    "our @xmath283 progenitors led to isotopic shifts in oxygen which moved the composition of the solar nebula down the slope-1 line , with the less energetic explosions producing larger shifts and time delays .",
    "the 23 m progenitors , which were the most energetic of the @xmath283 cases and especially effective in producing @xmath0 , generated shifts that amounted to only @xmath354 , including a time delay of 0.7 myr for @xmath2 to decay to its meteoritic value .",
    "this scenario , at least , is consistent with all the applied meteoritic constraints . if less than 100% of the oxygen penetrated the solar nebula material due to , for example , dust condensation , all but one of the 1d cases are consistent with the evidence from the early solar system .",
    "we note that this conclusion differs from what gm07 infer for injection of bulk ejecta from 21 and @xmath355 progenitors .",
    "gm07 likewise found isotopic shifts downward along the slope-1 line , but with a magnitude of 40 to 50 permil .",
    "it is worth noting that had gm07 assumed the same starting composition for the solar nebula , @xmath352 , that we do , then they would have found the solar nebula oxygen isotopic composition to be @xmath356 after injection of supernova material from an @xmath355 progenitor , and @xmath357 after injection of supernova material from an @xmath358 progenitor .",
    "although these shifts are moderately large , they are _ down _ the slope-1 line . as we established in  [ magofshifts ] , this would not have been _",
    "in_compatible with the meteoritic constraints , as some very @xmath8-rich meteoritic samples in this range are known , including cais in isheyevo , at @xmath359 @xcite , and a ferromagnesian cryptocrystalline chondrule in the ch chondrite acfer 214 , at @xmath360 @xcite .",
    "subsequently the mass - independent fractionation process would have shifted the nebula upward along the slope-1 line , erasing this isotopic shift and eventually producing the composition @xmath361 common to most cais ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that the supernova injection hypothesis can not be rejected based on 1d models .",
    "our investigation of other parameters suggest that it is even more difficult to be conclusive about supernova injection .",
    "we have considered a small number of progenitor masses undergoing spherically symmetric collapse ; in a few cases we varied other parameters , such as varying the explosion energy , or allowing for loss of a hydrogen envelope in a binary scenario , or allowing an asymmetrical explosion . in",
    "most of these cases the isotopic shifts in oxygen were large . among the cases considered here ,",
    "the final @xmath16 values in the solar nebula varied from @xmath228 to @xmath362 , and the final @xmath17 values varied from @xmath228 to @xmath363 .",
    "as gm07 found , most of the cases where meteoritic abundances of are injected lead to large ( @xmath364 ) shifts in oxygen isotopes .",
    "we also considered the yields in a 3d anisotropic explosion of a @xmath291 progenitor , in the bulk ejecta and two @xmath0-rich zones analogous to those in the 1d explosions .",
    "we find that a wide range of outcomes is possible , with oxygen isotopic shifts as large as hundreds of permil , or as low as @xmath289 .",
    "the fact that @xmath139 can decay to @xmath365 instead of @xmath56 at high temperatures makes the yield of @xmath56 especially sensitive to the thermodynamic trajectory of the ejecta , which partially accounts for the spread in the @xmath102 yields . on the one hand , the wide range of possible outcomes",
    "makes it nearly impossible to state conclusively that all supernova injection scenarios can be ruled out . on the other hand ,",
    "the wide range of possible outcomes seems to imply a degree of fine tuning so that the oxygen isotopic shifts in the solar nebula were not large , especially for the 3d case .",
    "we conclude that the hypothesis , that the @xmath0 in the solar nebula was due to supernova material injected into the sun s protoplanetary disk , can still be made compatible with meteoritic constraints , under two scenarios .",
    "the first is that the injected supernova material came from either the bulk ejecta , or from a region in a supernova that experienced thermodynamic conditions like the subexplosive c burning zone .",
    "the latter is more physically likely . with a @xmath366 myr time delay",
    ", the injection would have moved the solar nebula oxygen isotopic composition from @xmath82 to a more @xmath287-rich value along the slope one line .",
    "all but one of our explosions produce movement along the slope 1 line .",
    "we produce shifts as small as @xmath367 , which would have produced an accompanying meteoritic ratio @xmath292 .",
    "subsequent mixing of rocky material with a @xmath8-depleted reservoir would have then moved the composition of meteoritic inclusions up the slope-1 line to values @xmath66 , consistent with primitive cais , and further up the slope-1 line with time .",
    "the second scenario is one in which only dust grains are injected in to the protoplanetary disk , and very little of the supernova oxygen condenses into dust grains .",
    "if only the most refractory grains such as corundum were injected , then potentially @xmath368 , and the isotopic shifts would be negligible ( @xmath369 ) , for nearly all the cases considered here .",
    "it is worth noting that ca is equally refractory to al and is likely to condense from supernova ejecta under the same conditions that al condenses , so the meteoritic abundance of @xmath2 could still be matched following injection of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite have calculated that only @xmath370 of gas - phase ejecta are injected into a disk . if almost all of the ca and al in the ejecta are locked up in large grains ( radii @xmath371 ) that are efficiently injected @xcite , but less than a few percent of the oxygen is , then potentially all of the isotopic shifts in oxygen calculated here should be reduced by a factor of about 100 .",
    "essentially all of the 1d cases considered here would then conform with the meteoritic constraints , and even some of the 3d cases as well .",
    "to summarize , we agree with gm07 that oxygen isotopes can be a powerful constraint on supernova injection models .",
    "our calculations of oxygen isotopic shifts following injection from the bulk ejecta of 1d supernovae broadly match the results of gm07 .",
    "had gm07 assumed the same starting composition of the solar nebula that we did , and considered a smaller time delay between injection and isotopic closure , they would have found isotopic shifts for @xmath372 progenitors that would not be inconsistent with meteoritic constraints .",
    "our own calculations of the same case predict shifts that are similar , although smaller in magnitude , and which are also consistent with meteoritic constraints .",
    "the existence of an example that is consistent with the oxygen isotopic composition and the @xmath290 ratio of the solar nebula means that the supernova injection hypothesis can not be ruled out . because the nucleosynthesis of oxygen differs in asymmetric explosions , a much wider range of oxygen isotopes is possible in 3d explosions . because of the contingent nature of the injection it becomes difficult to make any statement about the possibility that the solar nebula acquired @xmath0 from such an asymmetric explosion .",
    "finally , all oxygen isotopic shifts are reduced if only large grains are injected into the protoplanetary disk , and only a small fraction of oxygen condenses into large grains .",
    "quantifying the fractionation of al and o during injection into a protoplanetary disk is the focus of ongoing work by this research group .",
    "if only a few percent of the total oxygen is injected , then nearly all the 1d explosions considered here could be consistent with the meteoritic constraints on oxygen isotopes and @xmath2 abundances .",
    "we therefore conclude it is premature to rule out the supernova injection hypothesis based on oxygen isotopes ."
