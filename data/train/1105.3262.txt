    "since the mid - twentieth century , feedback control has played crucial roles in science and engineering  @xcite .",
    "here , `` feedback '' means that a control protocol depends on measurement outcomes obtained from the controlled system .",
    "recently , feedback control has become increasingly important in terms of nonequilibrium physics , due to at least the following two reasons .",
    "first of all , stochastic aspects of thermodynamics  @xcite have become important due to recent theoretical and experimental developments .",
    "theoretically , a number of nonequilibrium equalities such as the fluctuation theorem and the jarzynski equality  @xcite have recently been found . on the other hand",
    ", experimental techniques have been developed to manipulate and observe small thermodynamic systems such as macromolecules and colloidal particles , and several nonequilibrium equalities have been experimentally verified  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "artificial  @xcite and biological  @xcite molecular machines have been investigated . in these contexts ,",
    "feedback control is useful to realize intended dynamical properties of small thermodynamic systems , and it has become a topic of active research  @xcite . secondly , feedback control sheds light on the foundations of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics concerning `` maxwell s demon ''  @xcite .",
    "in fact , maxwell s demon performs measurement and feedback control on thermodynamic systems .",
    "recently , maxwell s demon has attracted renewed interest  @xcite from the standpoints of modern information theory and statistical mechanics .",
    "a quintessential model of maxwell s demon is a single - particle heat engine proposed by l. szilard in 1929  @xcite . during the thermodynamic cycle of the szilard engine",
    ", the demon obtains @xmath0 bit ( @xmath1 nat ) of information by a measurement , performs feedback control , and extracts @xmath2 of positive work from a single heat bath . after numerous arguments on the consistency between the demon and the second law of thermodynamics",
    ", it is now understood that the work needed for the demon ( or equivalently the feedback controller ) during the measurement and information erasure compensates for the work that can be extracted by the demon  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can not extract a net positive work from the total system of the engine and the demon in an isothermal cycle , and therefore the presence of the demon does not contradict the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath2 of work extracted by the demon can be still useful . by using feedback control , we can increase the system s free energy without injecting any energy ( work ) to it .",
    "we stress that , without feedback control , we need the direct energy input into the system in order to increase its free energy due to the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "feedback control may be regarded as a powerful tool to control thermodynamic systems . since",
    "the crucial quantity is the information that is obtained to be used for feedback control , we may regard the szilard - type heat engine as `` information heat engine . ''",
    "recently , such an information heat engine was realized experimentally by using a colloidal particle  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate a general theory of feedback control on stochastic thermodynamic systems .",
    "in particular , we extend recent theoretical results on the generalizations of the fluctuation theorem and the jarzynski equality  @xcite to the situations in which the measurement and feedback control are non - markovian and there are multi - heat baths .",
    "our results serve as the fundamental building blocks of information heat engines .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .    in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the framework of stochastic thermodynamics in a general setup .",
    "we discuss classical stochastic systems that are in general non - markovian and in contact with multi - heat baths .",
    "we discuss the concept of entropy production and the detailed fluctuation theorem as our starting point . because they are general properties of nonequilibrium systems , our formulations and results in the following sections are not restricted to langevin systems but applicable to any classical stochastic systems that satisfy the detailed fluctuation theorem .    in sec .",
    "iii , we formulate measurements on thermodynamic systems .",
    "we discuss multi - measurements including continuous measurements , and investigate the properties of the mutual information obtained by the measurements . in particular , we introduce the two kinds of mutual information @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which will be shown to play key roles in the discussion of feedback control .    in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss feedback control on markov and non - markov processes , and investigate feedback control in terms of probability theory , where the causality of the measurement and feedback play a crucial role .    in sec .",
    "v , we derive the main results of this paper .",
    "we generalize the nonequilibrium equalities to situations in which the system is subject to feedback control . in particular , we derive two types of generalizations of the fluctuation theorem and the jarzynski equality .",
    "one involves a term concerning the mutual information , and the other involves a term of feedback efficacy . as corollaries ,",
    "we derive the generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics and a fluctuation - dissipation relation .    in sec .",
    "vi , we illustrate our general results by two examples : a generalized szilard engine with measurement errors and a feedback - controlled ratchet  @xcite . we discuss the former analytically and the latter numerically .    in sec .",
    "vii , we conclude this paper .    in appendix",
