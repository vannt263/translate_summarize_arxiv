    "the intracluster medium ( icm ) is stratified , not only in pressure , but also in entropy . until recently ,",
    "the latter was thought to be of paramount importance to the icm s dynamical stability .",
    "the reason for this is easy to understand . in an atmosphere where entropy increases upwards ,",
    "an upward adiabatic displacement of a fluid element leaves the element cooler than its surroundings .",
    "a cool element is denser ( because of local pressure balance ) , so the buoyancy force is restoring .",
    "if , on the other hand , the entropy were to decrease upwards , an upward adiabatic displacement produces a fluid element that is warmer than its surroundings and so there is no restoring buoyancy force , the fluid element continues to rise , and convective instability ensues @xcite .",
    "careful observations have shown that the icm generically has a positive entropy gradient ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and so , by this reasoning , is convectively stable .",
    "in fact , matters are not this simple .",
    "the icm is not a conventional fluid .",
    "firstly , it is magnetized .",
    "secondly , particle - particle collisions are rare .",
    "the conductive flow of heat consequently becomes strongly anisotropic with respect to the local magnetic field direction , since collisional energy exchange by ( predominantly ) the electrons can occur much more readily along the magnetic field than across it .",
    "the heat is then restricted to being channeled along magnetic lines of force . when the conduction timescale is shorter than any other dynamical timescale in the system , magnetic field lines become isotherms .",
    "such a radical change in the thermal behaviour of a weakly collisional plasma profoundly alters its stability properties . drawing on the powerful analogy between angular momentum and entropy stratification",
    ", @xcite argued that the temperature gradient takes precedence over the entropy gradient in determining the convective stability of a weakly collisional plasma .",
    "he supported this conjecture with a linear stability analysis that proved the existence of the magnetothermal instability ( hereafter , mti ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is triggered in regions where the temperature ( as opposed to the entropy ) increases in the direction of gravity .",
    "subsequent numerical work by @xcite and @xcite demonstrated the efficacy of the mti and extended it into the non - linear regime .",
    "numerical studies of the effect of the mti on the evolution of the outer regions of non - isothermal galaxy clusters , where the temperature decreases with distance from the central core , followed soon thereafter @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the inner @xmath0@xmath1 or so of non - isothermal clusters are characterised by outwardly increasing temperature profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the icm in these inverted temperature profiles is also buoyantly unstable to a heat - flux  driven instability , now referred to as the hbi .",
    "the hbi arises because perturbed fluid elements are heated / cooled by a background heat flux in such a way as to become buoyantly unstable .",
    "recently there has been a surge of numerical efforts to understand the non - linear evolution of the hbi and its implications for the so - called ` cooling - flow problem ' exhibited by cool - core clusters @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the work of @xcite and @xcite to include the effects of pressure anisotropy ( i.e. anisotropic viscosity ) .",
    "we are motivated by the simple consideration that one can not self - consistently take the limit of fast thermal conduction along magnetic field lines while simultaneously neglecting differences between the thermal pressure parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field direction . while the dynamical effects of pressure anisotropy occur on a timescale longer than conduction , in weakly collisional plasmas such as the icm this timescale is nevertheless still shorter than ( or at least as short as ) the dynamical timescale and , as a consequence , the mti and hbi growth times .",
    "our principal result is that , by stifling the convergence / divergence of magnetic field lines , pressure anisotropy significantly affects how the plasma in the icm interacts with the temperature gradient .",
    "instabilities which depend upon the convergence / divergence of magnetic field lines to generate unstable buoyant motions ( the hbi ) are suppressed over much of the wavenumber space , whereas those which are otherwise impeded by field - line convergence / divergence ( the mti ) are strengthened .",
    "we also comment on how pressure anisotropy affects the heat - flux  driven buoyancy overstability recently found by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "motivation ] , we motivate the inclusion of pressure anisotropy in our picture of weakly collisional buoyancy instabilities and provide a qualitative discussion of its effects .",
    "readers not interested in the mathematical details may read this section and proceed immediately to the conclusions (  [ sec : discussion ] ) . in section [ sec : formulation ] , we formulate the problem by presenting the basic equations , linearising them , and deriving the dispersion relation governing small perturbations about a simple equilibrium state . the solutions of this dispersion relation are examined in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] with a summary of our results and a brief discussion of their implications for the structure and evolution of the icm .",
    "the hbi and mti operate most efficiently at sufficiently small wavelengths for which the conduction rate is much greater than the local dynamical frequency , i.e. @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath4 is the thermal - pressure scale - height of the plasma , and @xmath5 is the thermal speed of the ions .",
    "this precludes the usual buoyant restoring force , which would otherwise result in brunt - visl oscillations , by ensuring magnetically - tethered fluid elements communicate thermodynamically much faster with one another than they do with the ambient medium . in weakly collisional environments such as the icm , this timescale separation is satisfied for a wide range of wavenumbers satisfying @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the wavenumber along the magnetic field , @xmath8 is the particle mean free path between collisions , and @xmath9 is the ion - ion collision frequency .",
    "typical values of @xmath10 in the icm decrease outwards from @xmath0@xmath11 to @xmath0@xmath12 in the cool - cores of non - isothermal clusters , and from @xmath0@xmath12 to @xmath0@xmath13 beyond the cooling radius out to @xmath0@xmath14 .",
    "it is important to note that , while the hbi and mti owe their existence to rapid conduction along magnetic field lines , the unstable perturbations themselves only grow at a rate @xmath0@xmath15 . this is because the free energy required to drive the instabilities is extracted from the background temperature gradient , which is set by macroscale processes , at a rate determined by gravity .",
    "there is however another timescale that ought to be considered . in a magnetized plasma ,",
    "any change in magnetic field strength must be accompanied by a corresponding change in the perpendicular gas pressure , since the first adiabatic invariant for each particle is conserved on timescales much longer than the inverse of the ion cyclotron frequency ( which is extremely short in the icm ; see  2.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting pressure anisotropy is the physical effect behind what is known as @xcite viscosity  the restriction of the viscous damping ( to dominant order in the larmor radius expansion ) to the motions and gradients parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "this in turn implies that perturbations in magnetic field strength are erased at the viscous damping rate @xmath16 ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : wvisc ] ) . while @xmath16 is smaller than @xmath17 by a factor @xmath0@xmath13 ( see end of section [ sec : lineareqns ] ) ,",
    "and so it may be tempting to ignore viscosity relative to conduction , @xmath16 is in fact much greater than the growth rates of the mti and hbi at most wavelengths at which the latter are usually thought to operate in the icm .",
    "here we provide a qualitative discussion of these effects .",
    "the hbi relies on the presence of a background heat flux , which may be tapped into by the convergence and divergence of conducting magnetic field lines .",
    "downwardly - displaced fluid elements find themselves in regions where field lines diverge ; they are conductively cooled via the background heat flux , lose energy , and sink further down in the gravitational potential . as they sink , the local field lines diverge further and an instability ensues .",
    "by contrast , an upwardly - displaced fluid element gains energy from the converging heat flux and thus buoyantly rises .",
    "braginskii viscosity hinders the hbi by damping perturbations to the magnetic field strength and thereby preventing convergence and divergence of field lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hbi ] ) .",
    "if @xmath18 , the convergence ( divergence ) of field lines responsible for the hbi is wiped away faster than upwardly ( downwardly ) displaced fluid elements can take advantage of the increased ( decreased ) heating . in fact , as we show in section [ sec : hbi ] , the buoyancy and viscous forces become nearly equal and opposite when the background field is vertical and @xmath18 .",
    "if the fluid element were to rise buoyantly , it would locally increase the magnetic field strength and generate a pressure anisotropy , which would cause a viscous stress that damps the vertical motion and halts the hbi .",
    "pressure anisotropy can be therefore thought of as providing an effective tension that ` tethers ' a buoyant fluid element to its original location , preventing it from rising .",
    "the only hbi modes to evade strong suppression are those which have wavenumbers satisfying @xmath19 ; these modes are not the same as those usually thought to be the fastest growing .     direction .",
    "a perturbation ( black arrows ) with non - zero @xmath20 and @xmath21 modifies the field lines as illustrated ( black curves ) .",
    "the heat flux , forced to follow the perturbed field lines , converges and diverges , leading to heating and cooling of the plasma . for a plasma with @xmath22 ,",
    "a downwardly - displaced fluid element loses energy , causing it to sink deeper in the gravitational field ( and vice - versa for an upwardly - displaced fluid element ) .",
    "the buoyancy force responsible for this behaviour is denoted by the white solid arrows .",
    "the pressure anisotropy , which is generated by motions along the background field lines , contributes a braginskii ( viscous ) force ( denoted by the grey solid arrows ) that impedes this motion . for wavelengths such that @xmath18 , the two forces become nearly equal and opposite and the convergence ( divergence ) of field lines responsible for the hbi",

    "it is this alignment that allows a downwardly ( upwardly ) displaced fluid element always to be cooler ( warmer ) than the surroundings it is passing through , even as its temperature rises ( falls ) . as the separation between magnetically - connected fluid elements grows",
    ", they take the magnetic field lines with them , aligning these heat conduits ever more parallel to the background temperature gradient and reinforcing fluid displacements .",
    "there is a weak preference for perturbations whose wavevectors are aligned with the background magnetic field ; otherwise the consequent convergence ( divergence ) of any background heat flux would heat ( cool ) downwardly ( upwardly ) displaced fluid elements ( the exact opposite of what happens with the hbi ) , thereby undermining the destabilising upward entropy transfer between magnetically - connected fluid elements .",
    "one effect of pressure anisotropy is to reinforce this preference by suppressing motions along field lines .",
    "another potentially more important effect is to destabilise many wave modes that were previously thought to be stable to the mti .",
    "one example is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : mti ] .",
    "the panel on the top exhibits a mode that is stable to the standard mti : the destabilising effect of generating a heat flux along field lines is exactly offset by the stabilising effect of converging / diverging background heat flux . when braginskii viscosity is included and @xmath18 , the same exact mode is unstable with a growth rate @xmath0@xmath15 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "any motion along the background magnetic field is rapidly damped and so the background heat flux can not interfere with the mti . in regions where the background heat flux converges in the @xmath26-@xmath27 plane it diverges in the @xmath26-@xmath28 plane , giving no net heat extraction . in effect , rapid braginskii damping effectively endows slow - mode perturbations ( which are subject to buoyancy forces ) with alfvnic characteristics ( i.e. perturbed magnetic fields and velocities that are predominantly oriented perpendicular to the background magnetic field ) .    in either case ,",
    "the fundamental point is that braginskii viscosity always suppresses perturbations that acquire free energy from the temperature gradient via a background heat flux ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : dt ] ) .",
    "this is generally bad for the hbi and good for the mti . in the next section we formalise these qualitative expectations",

    "differences between the perpendicular and parallel pressure in a magnetized plasma arise from the conservation of the first and second adiabatic invariants for each particle on timescales much greater than the inverse of the cyclotron frequency . when the magnetic field strength and/or the density change , @xmath38 and @xmath39 change in different ways @xcite .",
    "for example , conservation of the first adiabatic invariant @xmath41 implies that an increase in magnetic field strength must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the perpendicular pressure , @xmath42 .    when the collision frequency is larger than the rates of change of all fields ( i.e. @xmath43 )  a condition easily satisfied for buoyancy instabilities in the icm  it is straightforward to obtain an equation for the pressure anisotropy ( e.g. see @xcite for a simple derivation ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total plasma pressure . ) depends on the exact form of the collision operator used .",

    "this is referred to as the @xcite anisotropic viscosity .",
    "the ion contribution to the braginskii viscosity dominates over that of the electrons by a factor @xmath0@xmath49 .",

    "force balance then implies @xmath65 so that the inverse of the ion sound - crossing time across a thermal - pressure scale - height is equal to the dynamical frequency : @xmath66 in general @xmath67 , and so there may be a heat flux in the background state . in order to ensure our background state",

    "we allow perturbations ( denoted by a @xmath69 ) about the background state and order their amplitudes as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the mach number .",

    "since the mti and hbi occur with a growth rate comparable to the dynamical frequency , pressure anisotropy affects their dynamics significantly .    in the case of the hbi ,",
    "its propensity ( or , more accurately , its need ) to generate fluctuations along the background magnetic field suffers from the requirement for particles in a weakly collisional plasma to conserve their first and second adiabatic invariants .",
    "the hbi changes the field strength to linear order , which induces a pressure anisotropy , which manifests itself as braginskii viscosity and kills off the motions that generated the change in field strength in the first place . the only motions to entirely escape this constraining effect of pressure anisotropy  those that are alfvnically polarised  are also those that are stable to the hbi .",
    "the fastest growing hbi modes no longer occur at large parallel wavenumbers , but rather at wavenumbers satisfying the timescale ordering @xmath268 , or @xmath160 perturbations whose wavelengths along the background magnetic field are smaller than the thermal - pressure scale - height by at least a factor @xmath0@xmath269 , while potentially unstable to the hbi , are nevertheless strongly damped .",

    "the situation with the mti is more complicated .",

    "[ fig : mti_kxkz_angles ] ) .",
    "this obviates heat exchange with any background heat flux , a stabilising effect when the temperature increases in the direction of gravity .",
    "pressure anisotropy reinforces this preference , since perturbations whose projected wavevectors are not perfectly aligned with the background magnetic field are subject to strong viscous damping ( see bottom row of fig . [",
    "fig : mti_kxkz_angles ] ) . we have also found that many modes that were considered mti - stable [ e.g. @xmath227 ] or slowly growing become unstable in the presence of braginskii viscosity and grow at the maximum possible rate for a given background magnetic field orientation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mti_kpky ] ) .",
    "this is because , when @xmath271 , braginskii viscosity couples the alfvn- and slow - mode branches of the dispersion relation , so that slow - mode perturbations excite a buoyantly - unstable alfvnic response . by damping perturbations along magnetic field lines",
    ", pressure anisotropy frees these modes from the unfavourable consequences of having local field - line convergence / divergence .",
    "we anticipate that many of the results found by numerical simulations of the mti and hbi will change both quantitatively and qualitatively when the equations including both anisotropic heat and momentum transfer are implemented .",
    "this will likely have important consequences for our understanding of the thermodynamic stability of the icm .",
    "depending on the degree of collisionality in the cool cores of galaxy clusters , the field - line insulation found in many simulations to be a consequence of the non - linear evolution of the hbi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might be attenuated .",
    "this is because the large wavenumbers required to keep the hbi in action as the magnetic field becomes more and more horizontal are strongly suppressed by the pressure anisotropy they generate .",
    "moreover , the wavenumbers at which the hbi survives largely unsuppressed have parallel components too small to rigorously be considered local , especially as the hbi reorients the mean field to be horizontal ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : kmax ] ) . for a fiducial cool - core temperature profile @xmath134 , the parallel wavelength of maximum growth is equal to the thermal - pressure scale - height",
    "when @xmath272 .",
    "it is therefore tempting to speculate that , in the absence of strong turbulent stirring by an external agent , there exists a link between the degree of collisionality in cool cores and the mean direction of the magnetic field .    in the outer regions of non - isothermal clusters the non - linear evolution of the mti may be more vigorous than previously thought , since many modes classified as stable or slow - growing are actually maximally unstable .",
    "moreover , the fact that braginskii viscosity couples damped @xmath125 slow modes with mti - unstable alfvn modes , a feature not present in the standard mti , may profoundly affect the non - linear evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "on the other hand , the nonlinear excitation of the mti out of its linearly - stable end state ( @xmath273 ) , which is triggered by buoyantly - neutral horizontal motions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is unlikely to be affected by braginskii viscosity .",
    "these motions occur perpendicular to the magnetic field ( i.e. @xmath202 ) and are therefore undamped by braginskii viscosity . in either case",
    ", the spectrum of unstable modes will certainly be different , not only due to the presence of a parallel viscous cutoff but also because pressure anisotropy significantly modifies the dependence of growth rate on wavenumber .",
    "the heat - flux  driven buoyancy overstability elucidated analytically by @xcite and numerically by t. bogdanovi ( private communication ) is not significantly affected by pressure anisotropy .",
    "this is because the overstability occurs at sufficiently small wavenumbers such that conduction ( and therefore viscosity ) is not overwhelming ( see eqs .",
    "[ eqn : hbok ] and [ eqn : newhbo ] ) .",
    "braginskii viscosity only shifts the stability boundary slightly ( eq . [ eqn : hbostability ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the mti and hbi in the presence of anisotropic viscosity is , at least in principle , amenable to numerical simulation .",
    "the athena code affords one promising venue , as it is already set up for the inclusion of both anisotropic conduction and anisotropic viscosity ( j. stone , private communication ) . in practise",
    ", however , the implementation of pressure anisotropy into a numerical code is rather nuanced . if the pressure anisotropy exceeds @xmath0@xmath274 , very fast microscale instabilities ( e.g. firehose , mirror ) can be triggered , which will grow rapidly at the grid scale and wreak havoc upon a simulation if left unchecked .",
    "exactly how such instabilities nonlinearly saturate remains very much an open question ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "<S> this is particularly true as the magnetic field becomes more and more orthogonal to the temperature gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the field - line insulation found by recent numerical simulations to be a nonlinear consequence of the standard hbi might therefore be attenuated . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the fastest - growing mti modes are unaffected by anisotropic viscosity </S>",
    "<S> . however , we find that anisotropic viscosity couples slow and alfvn waves in such a way as to buoyantly destabilise alfvnic fluctuations when the temperature increases in the direction of gravity </S>",
    "<S> . consequently , many wavenumbers previously considered mti - stable or slow - growing are in fact maximally unstable . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the physical interpretation of these instabilities in detail .    </S>",
