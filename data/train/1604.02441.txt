    "this paper is meant to serve as a beginner s guide to weighted projective space , its varieties , and some basic algebra that follows on from this . in some places",
    "the explanations might be quite slow or dense , and the notation seemingly clumsy and complicated , but this is because nearly all of the currently existing literature on these topics is relatively advanced ( at least , to an undergraduate or early graduate ) , so this paper aims to fill a gap in the market , as it were .",
    "whenever there has been a decision to make in terms of either leaving some detail out or including it , the latter has almost always been chosen , even if this might not have been the best editorial choice .",
    "this is because this paper is not intended to be a textbook , where making the reader puzzle out details themselves helps enormously with their eventual understanding of the topic , but instead really as an exercise for the author  to never leave a proof or explanation as ` an exercise for the reader ' .",
    "this was how many of the proofs were originally passed over in the rough notes that came before this paper .",
    "but after having written the first draft of this paper , i then had to play the role of the reader , which meant having to complete all the ` exercises ' anyway .    at the end of the day",
    "though , this paper was written by an undergraduate student as a summer project .",
    "because of this , the author does nt have a complete understanding of each and every topic contained within , let alone of the surrounding area of mathematics and the inner workings of the machinery .",
    "sometimes questions are left unanswered  we apologise for this .",
    "we start off in [ sec : weighted_projective_space ] with the preliminary definitions of weighted projective space , giving an example or two , and introduce the idea of affine patches to mirror that of straight projective space .",
    "introduces the idea of a _ weighted projective variety _ and the topology to which it gives rise .",
    "again , this is very similar to the usual notion of projective varieties and the zariski topology on straight projective space , and so it seems natural to consider the idea of some sort of _ weighted projective nullstellensatz _ , which we do in [ sub : the_weighted_projective_nullstellensatz ] .",
    "finally in this section we define the coordinate ring of a weighted projective variety , which has the expected definition , bar the _ weighting _ of the algebraic indeterminates .",
    "the nullstellensatz and the coordinate ring let us now do what algebraic geometry always does : study the link between algebra and geometry .",
    "this is the main motivation of [ sec : algebra ] .",
    "we use the nullstellensatz to explain the @xmath39 construction and gain some intuition with this algebraic definition of weighted projective space , noting the similarities to that of the @xmath40 construction in affine algebraic geometry .",
    "using the idea of _ truncation of a graded ring _ we show that we can often reduce a weighted projective space to a simpler one , where any @xmath41 of the weights are coprime .",
    "we give these ` fully simplified ' weighted projective spaces the nice name of ` well - formed ' . to ensure that we do nt get lost in the heady realms of abstract algebra",
    ", this section ends with a few worked examples and applications .",
    "sticking with the theme of following a standard algebraic geometry course we look next , in [ sec : curves_in_weighted_projective_space ] , at _ plane curves _ , which are varieties in weighted projective 2-space given by the vanishing of a single weighted - homogeneous polynomial : @xmath42 .",
    "we show that sufficiently nice plane curves are also riemann surfaces , and then use some of the associated machinery ( such as the riemann - hurwitz formula ) to see what else we can find out .",
    "this section culminates with a version of the degree - genus formula for weighted projective plane curves .",
    "finally , [ sec : the_view_from_where_we_ve_got_to ] is a brief introduction to a few further ideas that follow on from the theory that we have developed up until this point .",
    "we cover ( speedily and not overly rigorously ) some ideas about the hilbert polynomial of a variety and the hilbert syzygy theorem .",
    "it is probably the most interesting of all sections , but is purely expository , with references to various sources that deal with the subject matter in more detail and depth .",
    "many thanks go to balzs szendri for suggesting the subject of , and then supervising , this project .",
    "his patience in answering my multitude of questions and explaining so many things was the main reason that the author was able to write this paper .",
    "thanks must also be given to edmund de unger academic purposes fund from hertford college , oxford , without which the author would not have been able to live in oxford throughout the composition of this paper .",
    "it is absurdly unlikely that there are no mistakes in this paper . if you find any , or have any recommendations for rewording or reordering of sections , please do email the author at mailto:timhosgood@gmail.com?subject=re:%20an%20introduction%20to%20weighted%20projective%20space[`timhosgood@gmail.com ` ] including the version date ( as found on the title page ) in your message .",
    "source files for this document are at https://github.com/thosgood/introduction-to-wps[`github.com/thosgood/introduction-to-wps ` ] and are available for use and modification .",
    "apologies are made in advance for the often overly - florid language that is most likely not - at - all suitable for rigorous mathematics .",
    "at a first glance , it s very possible that the idea of _ weighted projective space _ seems like a needless generalization of the usual projective space ( herein referred to as _ straight projective space _ ) to which we have all grown to know and love , especially when we show that we can simply embed weighted projective space into a large enough straight projective space .",
    "but it turns out that , quite often , using a weighted projective space instead of its embedding results in much simpler equations and a generally more manageable beast .",
    "so some projective varieties can be more easily described as weighted projective spaces ( similar to how some seemingly complicated varieties can turn out to be just a veronese embedding of some smaller straight projective space ) , but there is also the fact that weighted projective space itself encompasses the idea of straight projective space and allows us to study interesting ideas in more generality .",
    "we cover some particularly natural uses and applications of weighted projective space in [ sub : elliptic_curves_and_friends ] .",
    "like in a lot of algebraic geometry , there are two main ways of approaching a topic : geometrically and algebraically .",
    "the geometric way below mirrors the method usually used in approaching projective space and is a very ` hands - on ' construction .",
    "the algebraic way uses some language from very basic scheme theory , dealing with the @xmath39 construction , and is covered in [ sec : algebra ] .",
    "let @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and define the corresponding action of @xmath45 ( which we write as @xmath46 to avoid confusion ) on @xmath47 by @xmath48 we call @xmath49 the _ weights_.    we use this action to define weighted projective space as follows .",
    "[ def : geometric_wps ] let @xmath43 be a weight .",
    "@xmath19-weighted projective space _ as the quotient @xmath50    we write points in @xmath51 as @xmath52 , which represents the equivalence class of the point @xmath53 , omitting the subscript @xmath19 if it is clear that we are working in @xmath54 .",
    "it is easier to deal with weighted projective space once we have some technical lemmas and another perspective under our belt , and so the majority of big examples will come at the end of a later section , but here are a few right now to help build some kind of intuition .",
    "if we set all @xmath55 to be @xmath56 then the above definition coincides with that of straight projective space : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and we more commonly write @xmath59 $ ] for the coordinates .    [",
    "ex : something_like_a_cone ] _ we cover this example in more detail later , since it turns out to be an interesting one , so here we look at it quite briefly and not particularly rigorously . _",
    "consider @xmath60 .",
    "just like in straight projective space , any point is invariant under scaling , but here with respect to the weighting . for example , @xmath61    now we try to get a bit more of a grasp on the space as a whole . define a map @xmath62.\\ ] ] we claim that this map has its image in @xmath63 .",
    "firstly , since at least one of the @xmath33 is non - zero ( by the definition of weighted projective space ) , at least one of the monomials will also be non - zero .",
    "but then all that we need to check is that the image is invariant under scaling , i.e. that @xmath64 = [ \\lambda x_0 ^ 2:\\lambda x_0x_1:\\lambda x_1 ^ 2:\\lambda x_2 ] = [ x_0 ^ 2:x_0x_1:x_1 ^ 2:x_2].\\ ] ] simply using definitions we get that @xmath65 & = \\varphi(|x_0:x_1:x_2| ) \\\\              &",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    even though we havent really defined what an isomorphism should be for weighted projective spaces , it makes sense to think that , if we can find an inverse map that is also given by polynomials in each coordinate , then we can think of @xmath60 and its image under @xmath66 in @xmath63 as isomorphic .",
    "that is , we can think of @xmath66 as an embedding of @xmath60 in @xmath63 .    to construct our inverse map",
    "we take some point @xmath67 $ ] in the image . sadly , even though @xmath13 is algebrically closed , we ca nt take @xmath68 as our inverse map , since this is not polynomial in each coordinate .",
    "but we do know that @xmath69 for some @xmath70 , and so @xmath71 where we choose whichever option gives us a point in @xmath60 , i.e. depending on whether or not all of @xmath72 are zero .",
    "so we have two mutually inverse polynomial maps , which we ( for the moment ) are content with calling an isomorphism : @xmath73 \\\\                  & & & \\\\                  \\varphi^{-1}\\colon & x & \\to & { \\mathbb{p}}(1,1,2 ) \\\\                  & |y_0:y_1:y_2:y_3| & \\mapsto &                      \\begin{cases }                          |y_0:y_1:y_0y_3|\\quad\\mbox{if}~y_0,y_1,y_3\\neq0 ; \\\\                          |y_1:y_2:y_2y_3|\\quad\\mbox{otherwise}.                      \\end{cases }              \\end{array}\\ ] ] then understanding @xmath60 becomes a matter understanding the set @xmath74 .",
    "we do nt know yet what properties @xmath75 has exactly , but we will find out later on .",
    "one thing to notice though is that , on the patch @xmath76 of @xmath74 , we have something that looks a lot like the veronese embedding of @xmath77 into @xmath2 : the _ rational normal curve of degree @xmath78 _ , also known as the _",
    "flat conic_.    the way that we came up with the idea of the map in [ ex : something_like_a_cone ] was to construct all the degree two monomials , but where we consider @xmath79 as being a degree two element already .",
    "generally , though , we see that it looks like we should be able to embed weighted projective space into some straight projective space of high enough dimension , using something that looks remarkably like a veronese embedding .",
    "it s not entirely clear why exactly this should work at this point , but it turns out to be a much easier idea to justify once we have introduced the notion of weighted projective spaceusing the @xmath39 construction , and truncation , later on .      on straight projective space , picking some @xmath80 , we have the standard decomposition @xmath81\\mid x_i=0\\}\\sqcup\\{[x_0:\\ldots x_n]\\mid x_i\\neq0\\ } \\cong { \\mathbb{p}}^{n-1}\\sqcup{\\mathbb{a}}^n\\ ] ] where the sets @xmath82 are closed , and so the @xmath83 are open .",
    "it makes sense to consider the same sets @xmath84 and @xmath85 in weighted projective space , and even though we have yet to really define a zariski - style topology for some ideal @xmath86 in a suitable polynomial ring .",
    "but we do have to worry about which polynomial ring , and what it means to evaluate a polynomial at a point in wps .",
    "this is all covered in [ sub : weighted_projective_varieties ] , in particular in [ defn : zariski - topology ] . ]",
    "it turns out that these sets are closed and open ( respectively ) as before , in both the zariski and quotient topologies .    in this decomposition",
    "the @xmath85 , often called _ coordinate patches _ or _ affine patches _ , turn out to be very useful , since they cover the whole of projective space and are isomorphic to affine space , which is much easier to visualise geometrically in most cases .",
    "so given some projective variety , we can see how it intersects with the affine patches @xmath85 and study these using all our familiarity with affine space .",
    "but in weighted projective space we have a slight issue , namely that the @xmath85 are _ not _ isomorphic to @xmath87 , but instead some quotient of @xmath87 by a finite group .",
    "they still deserve the name ` affine patches ' then , since the quotient of an affine variety by a finite group is again an affine variety but a little bit more work needs to be done to see what exactly they look like .",

    "define the morphism @xmath106 by @xmath107\\ ] ] which we need to show is a well - defined map .",
    "our concern is that this map might rely on our choice of @xmath33 . by definition , where @xmath108 is a primitive @xmath55-th root of unity , @xmath109",
    "now @xmath110 \\\\                  & = \\big[\\omega_i\\cdot(x_0,\\ldots,{\\widehat{1}},\\ldots , x_n)\\big ] = \\varphi_i\\big(|x_0:\\ldots:1:\\ldots : x_n|\\big ) ,          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so our map is well defined .",
    "define its inverse morphism @xmath111 by @xmath112 \\mapsto |y_1:\\ldots : y_{i-1}:1:y_i:\\ldots : y_n|\\ ] ] and note that it is indeed an inverse to @xmath66 .",
    "we can show that it is well defined in exactly the same way that we did for @xmath113 , and clearly both @xmath113 and @xmath114 are polynomial in each coordinate .",
    "although the @xmath85 give us a nice affine space to work with , it is a quotient space and so can be quite tricky to realise at times .",
    "much easier is the idea of looking at the covering space of the affine patches , since it turns out that if the covering space of the affine patch has certain nice properties then so too does the affine patch .",
    "we now define a few terms to avoid confusion after all this talk of ` affine patches ' .",
    "[ defn : quotient - covering - affine - patches ] given some subset @xmath115 we define the _ quotient affine patches @xmath116 _ and the _ covering affine patches @xmath117 _ of @xmath75 as @xmath118                  { \\overline{x_i } } & = & \\pi_i^{-1}(x\\cap u_i ) & \\subseteq & { \\mathbb{a}}^n              \\end{array}\\ ] ] where we use the isomorphism and the quotient map @xmath119 .",
    "so we have two different types of affine patches to think of : those that we glue together to get the ambient weighted projective space , which are in some way ` folded up ' ( the quotient affine patches ) ; and those that come from ` unfolding ' the aforementioned ones ( the covering affine patches ) .",
    "the reason for considering both is that they can be equally useful , but in different ways .",
    "really , the covering affine patches come into their own in [ sec : curves_in_weighted_projective_space ] , since we already know many useful facts about varieties in @xmath87 .",
    "_ although we are dealing with so - called weighted - homogeneous ideals here , we are really just looking at homogeneous ideals ( i.e. graded submodules where we consider the ring as a module over itself ) of a graded ring .",
    "thus most standard proofs can be used for the vast majority of the lemmas in this section , and at times we simply refer to them instead of providing our own .",
    "a good reference is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  6 ,  section  1 ) . _",
    "before we define the notion of _ weighted projective varieties _ we need to cover a few formalities .",
    "the main one is ` how do we define evaluating a polynomial at a point in weighted projective space , and is this well defined ? ' .",
    "it turns out that , just as in straight projective space , evaluating a polynomial at a point is _ not _ well defined , but seeing whether or not a point is a zero of a polynomial _ is _ , as long as our polynomial is homogeneous , but in a slightly different sense .",

    "we see that a variety which falls under the category of that in [ ex : k - equals-1 ] ( so given by @xmath933 ) has the hilbert series @xmath934 and one in the same family as in [ ex : k - equals-2 ] has hilbert series @xmath935    so if we can calculate the hilbert series of a variety then , by writing it as a fraction and changing the denominator , we can get a rough idea of what embeddings we can get from it .",
    "we can see what the weights @xmath55 the denominator gives us , and we can say what sort of relations and syzygies its defining polynomials will satisfy by looking at the numerator .",
    "why is this ?",
    "well , let @xmath627 be a projective variety with homogeneous coordinate ring @xmath936/\\operatorname{\\mathbb{i}}(x)$ ] .",
    "then we can construct the hilbert series @xmath937 of @xmath75 by considering some ample divisor @xmath829 on @xmath75 as we did above : @xmath938 using riemann - roch we can usually find @xmath939 explicitly , often by choosing @xmath841 to be a specifically nice point in @xmath75 . then , _ ignoring any issues of convergence _",
    "( by assuming that @xmath940 is small enough ) , we can try to rewrite this series as a single fraction .",
    "this is probably best explained here as an example , since we are being nowhere near rigorous enough to try to explain ourselves in proper mathematical language .",
    "we ve already calculated @xmath941 for @xmath830 , and so we know that the hilbert polynomial of our elliptic curve is @xmath942 now , indeed @xmath943 and by our previous comments this looks like an embedding of @xmath601 into @xmath5 as the vanishing of a single degree-@xmath575 curve .",
    "similarly , @xmath944 which both agree with the embeddings that we already know .",
    "namely @xmath945 and @xmath946 .",
    "the idea of generating functions and the combinatorics behind all this can really help to give us some intuition as to why we can read off such data , and why the numerator tells us about the relations . if @xmath947 has generators @xmath948 such that @xmath949 then to see how many combinations ( i.e. products ) of these lie in @xmath950 we simply look at @xmath951 , defined as the @xmath13-th coefficient in the series expansion of @xmath952 but if there are some relations between the @xmath33 then we wo nt be getting the full amount of distinct combinations all the time . that is , we wo nt have @xmath951 distinct combinations of the @xmath33 in @xmath953 when @xmath13 becomes too large , since there will be some cancellation , and so we need to adjust our fraction to account for this  we need to add in some higher order negative terms to reduce the @xmath954 for @xmath955 .",
    "but then there might be some relations between the relations of the @xmath33 , and in that case we have reduced the @xmath954 too much and we will actually have _ more _ combinations of the @xmath33 , and so we will need to put in some positive terms of higher order to make the @xmath954 larger , and so on .        we know that a canonical divisor @xmath843 on @xmath601 has degree @xmath959 and is thus linearly equivalent to a hyperplane divisor @xmath960 for any line @xmath961 .",
    "so by riemann - roch , we know that @xmath962 for @xmath963 , since then @xmath849 thus @xmath964 . by definition , we can see that when @xmath965 we get @xmath966 , the question then is : how do we calculate @xmath941 for @xmath967 ?",
    "we know that @xmath941 is non - decreasing , and if we can further show that @xmath968 then we can use clifford s theorem to obtain some bounds , but this still gives us a few possible options .",
    "it turns out that , actually , there is no one answer ",
    "it depends on the point @xmath270 that we choose .",
    "we always have @xmath969 ( by non - hyperellipticity ) , and we can actually choose @xmath270 to get any of the possible values of @xmath970 and @xmath971 that we like . so we have the following possibilities for the hilbert series coefficients : @xmath972 for the sake of concreteness , let s just examine the first one here : assume that @xmath973 following our naive approach from before , then , we find that we can pick elements @xmath974 that generate @xmath975 without any relations until we hit @xmath976 , and then we have too many elements .",
    "the @xmath25-th coefficient of the series expansion of @xmath977 tell us how many elements of @xmath975 we can generate with @xmath978 , as in [ ex : elliptic - first ] .",
    "since we have too many elements for @xmath979 we expect our hilbert polynomial to have the same denominator as @xmath768 , but with a negative term of degree @xmath980 in the numerator to lower the coefficients for @xmath882 in @xmath768 when @xmath979 .",
    "this is where combinatoric intuition can help us understand a problem about projective plane curves .",
    "if we do some algebra , we see that @xmath981 from this we can see that our discovery that there must be a relation of degree @xmath980 seems correct , and we speculate ( and _ only _ speculate , not claim with any amount of certainty ) by looking at how the signs change that there are also relations of degree @xmath982 with syzygies of degree @xmath983 and higher syzygies between them of degree @xmath984 .",
