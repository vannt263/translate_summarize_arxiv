    "in this paper we briefly discuss the usage of multigrid ( mg ) iteration schemes to solve the non - lte problem of the 2nd kind as defined by @xcite .",
    "the era of extensive development of mg methods started in 1970 s by the work of @xcite .",
    "several steps in using mg methods applied to radiative transfer were made by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that this technique leads to a great improvement of the convergence rate .",
    "this paper demonstrates how to apply these methods to a more general solution of polarized radiative transfer with realistic multilevel atomic models and complicated structure of overlapping lines .",
    "the effects of depolarizing collisions is taken into account .",
    "for the description of the atomic state , we adopt the density - matrix formalism and the representation in the basis of irreducible tensorial operators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the elements of atomic density matrix have the usual form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the energy level of total angular momentum @xmath4 , and ( @xmath5 ) are the multipolar components of the level ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) . in stationary regime ,",
    "the density - matrix elements are solutions of the local statistical equilibrium equations , @xmath8 the structure of the @xmath9-matrix has been extensively discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we assume that this matrix has the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the matrix of radiative rates , and @xmath12 is the matrix of collisional rates ( impact approximation ) .    the radiative transfer equation for the set of four stokes parameters @xmath13 has the usual form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the emission vector of the local sources , @xmath16 is the absorption matrix , and @xmath17 is the matrix of stimulated emission .",
    "all these quantities are dependent on radiation frequency , @xmath18 , position vector , @xmath19 , and direction of propagation determined by the unit vector @xmath20 .",
    "finally , @xmath21 is the parametrization of the radiation path along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "most of the existing non - lte solvers use the methods based on @xmath22-operator splitting similar to the one of @xcite . depending on organization , these schemes are numerically equivalent to the jacobi or gauss - seidel smoothing procedures ( for details , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "these smoothing procedures do reduce high frequencies of the solution fast , but poor convergence is achieved for low frequencies .",
    "( with `` high frequencies '' we mean those which are comparable to the spatial frequency of grid points approximating the continuous scale . ) the principles of mg schemes are based on the idea of using coarse grids to reduce the low frequencies , and fine grids to smooth their high - frequency components .",
    "it can be showed that such a process may lead to the optimal cpu time demands of @xmath1 , @xmath0 being the number of points per decade of optical scale . for comparison ,",
    "the jacobi and gauss - seidel methods scales approximately as @xmath23 .",
    "we have applied the non - linear version of the _ standard multigrid _ scheme based on the coarse grid correction ( cgc ) technique ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "cgc is the process of correction of the fine - grid approximation of the solution using the solutions on the coarse grids .",
    "schematically , it can be described in the following way : the defect ( or residuum ) of the fine - grid approximation is computed by several calls of the sweeping procedure ( jacobi , etc . ) ; then both defect and the initial guess of the solution are restricted to the coarse grid , and a new solution on the coarse grid is obtained using these data .",
    "this coarse - grid solution is interpolated to the fine grid , and the density - matrix components are corrected .",
    "this process can be repeated recursively for every grid in order of increasing grid steps .",
    "this recursive process leads to the so - called v , w , or more complicated diagrams , depending on the way in which the recursion is implemented @xcite .    in our code",
    "we use the parabolic short - characteristics technique of @xcite , and as a smoothing algorithm we use the jacobi iteration , similar to the one of @xcite , with modifications to include the effects of line overlapping .",
    "for demonstrating the possibilities of this technique , we chose the model of a semi - infinite , plane - parallel , atmosphere .",
    "the atmosphere is isothermal ( @xmath24k ) , with constant volume density of neutral hydrogen , @xmath25 , thermal electrons , @xmath26 , and protons , @xmath27 .",
    "no magnetic field is taken into account .",
    "the scattering of radiation is supposed to fulfill the conditions of complete frequency redistribution , and the @xmath28 and @xmath29 stokes parameters vanish due to the symmetries of the problem .",
    "we adopted a hydrogen atomic model with 9 fine - structure energy levels ( @xmath30 to @xmath31 ) and all the non - vanishing multipole components @xmath32 of density matrix .",
    "all the coherence elements ( @xmath33 ) are identically zero due to the model s symmetries . the coherences between different energy levels have been neglected due to the small natural widths of the levels in comparison to their separations , and due to the selection rules for dipole radiative transitions .    collisional rates with thermal electrons and protons for fine structure transitions , @xmath34 , were computed in part using the semiclassical theory of @xcite , for transitions within the same shell , and in part using the data of collisional cross - sections from the atomic and molecular data information system ( amdis ; ` http://www-amdis.iaea.org/ ` ) , for transitions between different shells .",
    "the number of logarithmically spaced nodes in the fine grid is @xmath35 and 5 grids were used in total .",
    "the number of nodes in the `` @xmath36 '' grid is equal to @xmath37 .",
    "the initial guess for the atomic density - matrix elements is given by the lte populations determined in the unpolarized case .",
    "of atomic populations , @xmath38 , in the mg case ( solid line ) is compared to the jacobi solution ( dashed line ) .",
    "the maximum relative error @xmath39 ( with respect to the fully converged solution ) for mg case ( dotted line ) and jacobi case ( dot - dashed line ) is showed as well .",
    "the norm used is @xmath40 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the graph shows the effect of 11 v - cycles with 2 pre- and 15 post - smoothing jacobi iterations.,width=457 ]",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a comparison between the convergence rates of the jacobi and the mg methods . the effect of coarse - grid solutions is reflected by the dramatic evolution of the maximum relative change of the populations .",
    "the coarser the grid the shorter the evaluation time , and the higher the rate of approaching to the truncation error of the grid . the maximum relative error dominated by the long - period components",
    "is strongly reduced by the recursive cgc during the v - cycles .",
    "the time saving of the mg method in this particular model is about a factor 4 compared to the jacobi method .",
    "it must be noticed that the efficiency of mg increases as fast as the efficiency of the smoothing procedure .",
    "the most important benefit from mg s is the asymptotical @xmath1 behavior , which designates the method for use in solutions of problems that necessitate strong refinements .",
    "moreover the presented 1d geometry is the slowest case as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
