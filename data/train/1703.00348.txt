    "in the last years , much theoretical and experimental attention has been focused on the study of non perturbative quantities in qcd encoding fundamental information on the partonic proton structure , e.g. , parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , transverse momentum dependent pdfs ( tmds ) , double parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) and generalized parton distribution functions ( gpds ) @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , gpds allow to grasp information on the three dimensional partonic structure of hadrons @xcite , and thanks to the so called ji s sum rule , to access the orbital angular momentum of partons inside hadrons .",
    "this knowledge is crucial to shed some light onto the still open problem of the proton spin crisis . from an experimental point of view , gpds represent a challenge due to the difficulties in the measurements of high energy exclusive events ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper , we study the gpds using the ads / qcd scheme proposed by brodsky and de tramond @xcite based on the original ads / cft maldacena conjecture @xcite .",
    "the idea comes from the observation that for small momentum transfer the qcd coupling constant can be approximated by a constant and quark masses can been neglected @xcite .",
    "confinement can be simulated in different ways @xcite",
    ". a crucial ingredient of this proposal is the mapping between the light front ( lf ) hamiltonian formulation of qcd and the ads description of hadrons .",
    "this correspondence is implemented by relating the fifth dimensional variable @xmath0 with the lf transverse position and longitudinal momentum fractions carried by partons @xcite .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to the calculations of the hadronic spectrum , the form factors and the gpds for @xmath1 ( @xmath2 represents the skewness ) @xcite . moreover , a first analysis of hard deep inelastic scattering at small @xmath3 within ads / cft has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we focus our attention in the calculation of the gpds for @xmath4 , within the soft - wall model @xcite , proposing a suitable extension of the approaches already discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "this step is necessary to provide a complete description of the gpds in the ads / qcd scheme which allows comparison of theoretical results with data usually obtained for @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , our results open new ways to calculate observables within the ads / qcd framework which may lead to useful predictions on the structure of hadrons .",
    "before we describe gpds let us review the ads / qcd formalism for the calculation of form factors within the soft - model . in this case",
    "the breaking of conformal invariance is induced by introducing a quadratic dilaton term @xmath6 in the ads action .",
    "the effect of the breaking can be directly incorporated into the baryonic field @xcite and the confining potential , depending on the dilaton term , is put in by hand in the soft - wall model .",
    "the strategy to connect ads quantities to the correspondent light front ( lf ) ones is to write the ads dirac equation , associated to the ads action , as a lf equation and to obtain the corresponding baryon wave function by solving an equation in the @xmath7 spinor representation @xcite .",
    "let us just show the analytic expression of such baryonic functions for two values of the orbital angular momentum , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively @xcite :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 gev has been fixed to fit data on proton and neutron form factors @xcite .",
    "the other fundamental ingredient of the calculation of form factors within the ads / qcd scheme is the bulk - to - boundary propagator whose expression , in the soft wall model , reads  @xcite :    @xmath12    following refs .",
    "@xcite , the final expression for form factors reads as follows :    @xmath13    where the effective charge @xmath14 determines the spin - flavor structure of form factors @xcite ( see explicit expressions of dirac and pauli form factors in ref",
    ". @xcite . )",
    "as already discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the proton gpds at @xmath15 , within the soft - wall model , can be calculated from form factors . however , for the purpose of the present analysis , it is convenient to relate the spin dependent light - cone correlator @xcite @xmath16 to @xmath17 , being @xmath18 the third component of the proton spin in the initial ( final ) state . to this aim ,",
    "using then the parametrization of dirac and pauli form factors in terms of the flavor dependent gpds , one obtains @xcite :    @xmath19~ , \\\\",

    "the variable @xmath0 turns out a function of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the transverse position and longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the @xmath23 parton respectively @xcite .",
    "we proceed to calculate the gpds for @xmath24 .",
    "these quantities have been also studied in a recent paper in ref .",

    "in this section , the main results of the calculations of the valence gpds at @xmath65 are presented .",
    "the difference between the calculations of the gpds , performed by means of the uncorrelated and correlated scenarios can be considered as the theoretical error of the present approach . in fig .",
    "[ h03 ] , the gpd @xmath66 has been shown for @xmath67 gev@xmath68 ( left panel ) and @xmath69 gev@xmath68 ( right panel ) for four values of @xmath2 ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ h03 ] ) . as",
    "one can notice , the shape of gpds , in the @xmath2 dependence , is basically decreasing , qualitatively in agreement with results discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where gpds have been calculated within constituent quark models .",
    "this trend is also confirmed for the gpd @xmath70 , see fig .",
    "same results are found for the flavor @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath72 , as expected , results discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite are fully recovered using both the correlated and uncorrelated form of @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , for the gpds @xmath46 , one can notice that the difference between the calculations with the correlated and the uncorrelated two body intrinsic proton functions is quite small .",
    "this feature can be understood by looking at the central panel of fig .",
    "[ intpwf ] where the ratio @xmath73 has been shown for @xmath74 gev@xmath64 ( approximately the maximum of the distributions ) .",
    "the full line corresponds to the calculation with the correlated ansatz and the dot - dashed one is obtained by means of the uncorrelated two body intrinsic function .",
    "as one can see , for small values of @xmath26 in both cases the plus component is dominant w.r.t .",
    "the minus one .",
    "let us remark that since the bulk - to - boundary propagator , eq .",
    "( [ gff0 ] ) , is peaked around @xmath75 , the integrals eqs .",
    "( [ gpdexi ] , [ gpdhxi ] ) are dominated by the small @xmath26 region .",
    "furthermore , in this range of @xmath26 , the difference between the correlated and uncorrelated calculations of the plus component of the two body intrinsic function ( see the full line in the right panel of fig . [ intpwf ] ) is dramatically small , a feature that explains the small error band in the evaluation of the gpd @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ h03 ] . regarding the gpd @xmath76 , since in this case , as one can see in eq .",
    "( [ gpdexi ] ) , this quantity depends only on the minus component of the two body intrinsic proton function , the error between the correlated and uncorrelated ansatz is bigger then in the plus component case .",
    "one can realize such feature by looking at the dot - dashed line in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ intpwf ] .",
    "this aspect explains why , in the same kinematic conditions , the error in the calculation of the gpd @xmath76 is bigger then that in the gpd @xmath46 case .",
    "let us stress that for both gpds for very small values of @xmath2 and @xmath77 , the kinematic condition useful to study ji s sum rule and the three dimensional partonic structure of the proton , the error in the present approach is quite small . in particular , in this framework , the decreasing trend of the gpds in the @xmath2 dependence is due to partonic correlations .",
    "furthermore , our analysis shows that if high values of @xmath2 and @xmath77 are reached in experiments , the gpds at @xmath4 are more sensitive to details of the full proton wave function than form factors or gpds at @xmath1 , allowing to access parton correlations usually integrated out in the diagonal case .",
    "this analysis has taught us how distributions sensitive to correlations , like gpds in non forward regions , evaluated thanks to the experience gained in the lf and ads / qcd approaches , can be used to find the importance of correlations in the structure of hadrons . in further studies ,",
    "this analysis will be completed by calculating , within the present scheme , other distributions , like dpdfs already investigated within the lf approach @xcite , and which have shown to be sensitive to the kind of correlations here addressed .",
    "work is in progress in that direction .",
    "a first evaluation of an approximated expression of dpdfs , through the ads / qcd correspondence , together with the calculation of an experimental observable is discussed in ref .",
    "in the present analysis , gpds have been calculated in a fully non forward region , namely @xmath2 and @xmath77 different from zero . to this aim ,",
    "the usual strategy , developed to evaluate gpds at @xmath1 , within the ads / qcd correspondence together with the soft - wall model , has been extended in order to evaluate the full proton light - front wave function from ads / qcd , including , in principle , two body correlations . as shown , within this approach , results previously discussed in other analyses have been successfully recovered and the @xmath2 dependence found for the leading twist gpds @xmath46 and @xmath76 , evaluated for different flavors , is compatible with the one discussed in calculations with constituent quark models .",
    "furthermore , since in the present study the full proton wave function is obtained by solving an integral equation , different solutions have been scrutinized for the numerical evaluations of gpds and a discussion on the theoretical error of the approach has been provided . in particular , for small values @xmath2 , using different proton wave functions , leading to same form factors and gpds at @xmath1 , similar results have been found . however , since at high values of @xmath2 , in particular for the gpd @xmath76 , these quantities start to be sensitive to details of the proton structure , e.g. , to two body correlations , differences in the calculations of the latter with correlated and uncorrelated distributions become sizable .",
    "results presently discussed demonstrate that in principle new information on partonic structure of hadrons can be obtained from gpds at @xmath5 , indirectly accessing two parton correlations , usually studied , e.g. with double parton distribution function in double parton scattering . in closing",
    ", our analysis shows that ads / qcd can be used in the future to estimate other fundamental observables and parton distributions .",
