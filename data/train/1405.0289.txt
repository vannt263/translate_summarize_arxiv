    "the properties of pseudoscalar mesons constituted from light quarks are strongly influenced by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) , an emergent phenomenon in the standard model which plays a major role in the origin of more than 98% of the visible mass in the universe @xcite .",
    "for example , it is dcsb that explains both the momentum evolution of qcd s lagrangian current - quark masses @xcite , so that they acquire values at infrared momenta which are enhanced by two orders - of - magnitude , to values commensurate with those used in describing the baryon spectrum with constituent - quark models : @xmath7mev@xmath8mev ; and also the quadratic increase of pseudoscalar meson masses with increasing current - quark mass @xcite : @xmath9 .",
    "given that quantum mechanical models describe vector mesons as merely spin - flip excitations of pseudoscalar mesons , in analogy with para- ( @xmath10 ) and ortho- ( @xmath11 ) positronium , it is natural to enquire into the impact of dcsb within these companion vector - meson bound states .    a clean way to expose differences between the impact of dcsb in pseudoscalar and vector mesons",
    "is to compare their wave functions .",
    "however , since dcsb is an emergent feature of quantum field theory and is strictly impossible in quantum mechanics with a finite number of degrees - of - freedom , such a comparison is not generally possible .",
    "the closest thing one has to a wave function in quantum field theory is a meson s poincar - covariant bethe - salpeter wave function , @xmath12 , which reduces to a schrdinger wave function whenever a nonrelativistic limit is sensible @xcite ; but that is never the case for the valence - quark constituents of light mesons .",
    "an answer to the problem of defining an appropriate quantum field theory wave function lies in projecting @xmath12 onto the light front .",
    "the light - front wave function of an interacting quantum system provides a connection between dynamical properties of the underlying relativistic quantum field theory and notions familiar from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it can translate features that arise purely through the infinitely - many - body nature of relativistic quantum field theory into images whose interpretation is seemingly more straightforward .",
    "herein , therefore , we provide a comparison and interpretation of light - front projections of pseudoscalar and vector meson bethe - salpeter wave functions ; namely , their respective valence - quark ( twist - two parton ) distribution amplitudes ( pdas ) .    as wave functions , the pdas of pseudoscalar- and vector - mesons are not directly measurable .",
    "nevertheless , many of their features can be constrained by experiment .",
    "for example , the pion s valence - quark pda modulates the momentum - dependence of its elastic electromagnetic form factor at large momentum transfers @xcite , a feature which is evident for @xmath13gev@xmath14 @xcite ; and vector meson pdas can be inferred @xcite from diffractive vector - meson production experiments , such as those performed at the hadron electron ring accelerator ( hera ) @xcite .",
    "more generally , in fact , meson pdas can be used to express the cross - sections for numerous hard exclusive processes @xcite ; and therefore the estimation of meson pdas has long been topical . in this context , complementing work by other authors using different tools ( e.g. , refs . ) , herein we present both predictions for the @xmath0- and @xmath1-meson valence - quark pdas , and their comparison with the pion s pda , obtained using the same dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) framework employed recently to explain the electromagnetic pion form factor @xcite .",
    "this manuscript is arranged as follows . in sec.[secvpda ] we describe formulae necessary to compute and understand our results for meson bethe - salpeter amplitudes and pdas .",
    "those results are detailed in sec.[secresults ] ; and sec.[secepilogue ] provides a summary and perspective .",
    "in this section we explicitly develop formulae for the case of the @xmath0-meson .",
    "since the @xmath1 is also a @xmath15 state , the only changes for that case are straightforward , being associated with replacing the @xmath16-quarks ( we assume isospin symmetry ) by the @xmath17-quarks and adjusting the meson mass : @xmath18 .",

    "no ground - state pseudoscalar or vector meson bethe - salpeter equation solution exhibits corresponding behaviour @xcite .",

    "an identical conclusion was reached in ref.@xcite , via consideration of the first moment of the kaon s valence - quark pda , which is a direct measure of su@xmath6-flavour breaking and must therefore vanish in the conformal limit .",
    "hence , realistic meson pdas are necessarily broader than @xmath62 .",
    "it follows that an insistence on using just a few terms in eq . to represent a hadron s pda",
    "will typically lead to unphysical oscillations ; i.e. , humps , just as any attempt to represent a box - like curve via a fourier series will inevitably lead to slow convergence and spurious oscillations . in our analysis of vector meson pdas , we will use an alternative to _",
    "assumption  a _ , which is explained in the next subsection .",
    "returning now to eqs . , and making use of the properties of polarisation vectors and the relationship between bethe - salpeter wave functions in configuration and momentum space , one obtains    [ mompdas ] @xmath65    where : @xmath66 is a poincar - invariant regularisation of the four - dimensional integral , with @xmath67 the ultraviolet regularisation mass - scale ; and @xmath68 are , respectively , the renormalisation constants for the quark wave - function and the tensor vertex .",

    "these observations are consistent with : the simpler @xmath195-meson bethe - salpeter amplitude supporting less repulsion from spin - orbit - like interactions than the more complicated vector meson amplitude ; and the violation of su@xmath6-flavour symmetry being modulated primarily by mass - scales associated with dynamical instead of explicit chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath214 cf .",

    "this dilation is the energy scale to which one must evolve a given pda in order that @xmath196 may be considered a reliable approximation ; and , as remarked above , it has long been known @xcite that this can only be the case when it is accurate to write @xmath63 . for the pion",

    "the pdas were reconstructed from their moments using a novel technique that provides for rapid convergence .",
    "the pdas are all broad , concave functions [ eqs . ] , whose marked dilation with respect to the asymptotic distribution , @xmath237 , is an expression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) .",
    "whilst this connection is clearest for the pion , it is also readily apparent for the vector - mesons because : they are constituted from valence - quarks dressed in the same manner as those in the pion ; the scales evident in their bethe - salpeter amplitudes are fixed by the same dynamics ; and vector meson properties , which may reasonably be considered as measuring the scale of dcsb , are large [ table  [ tablestatic ] and eqs . ] .",

    "the study described herein may be refined by improving upon the rl truncation ; e.g. , by using the dcsb - improved gap and bethe - salpeter kernels explained in refs.@xcite . in the pion case , such improvement noticeably softened the distribution @xcite .",
    "we anticipate a qualitatively similar effect on the vector meson pdas ; but it will be weaker because , compared to the pion , vector meson bethe - salpeter amplitudes are more complicated and hence more able , even in rl truncation , to express effects such as spin - orbit repulsion , so that their internal structure is less susceptible to modification .",

    "<S> a rainbow - ladder truncation of qcd s dyson - schwinger equations is used to calculate @xmath0- and @xmath1-meson valence - quark ( twist - two parton ) distribution amplitudes ( pdas ) via a light - front projection of their bethe - salpeter wave functions , which possess @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave components of comparable size in the meson rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> all computed pdas are broad concave functions , whose dilation with respect to the asymptotic distribution is an expression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . the pdas can be used to define an ordering of valence - quark light - front spatial - extent within mesons : this size is smallest within the pion and increases through the @xmath4-polarisation to the @xmath5-polarisation of the vector mesons ; effects associated with the breaking of su@xmath6-flavour symmetry are significantly smaller than those associated with altering the polarisation of vector mesons . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the predicted pointwise behaviour of the @xmath0-meson pdas is in quantitative agreement with that inferred recently via an analysis of diffractive vector - meson photoproduction experiments . </S>"
