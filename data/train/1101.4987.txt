    "one of the most significant tasks for high - energy experiments is to search for scalar higgs particles@xcite .",
    "although the standard model ( sm)@xcite has achieved impressive experimental success , the higgs boson , which is predicted by the sm for spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , remains a mystery .",
    "moreover , there exists the problem of the quadratically divergent contributions to the corrections to the higgs boson mass , which is the so - called naturalness problem .",
    "alternative conceptional difficulties , such as the hierarchy problem , the necessity of the tuning and the nonoccurrence of gauge coupling unification at high energies , suggest that the sm is probably the low - energy limit of a more fundamental theory .    as the most hopeful extensions of the sm",
    ", the supersymmetric ( susy ) models can solve such problems mentioned above . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite is the simplest one among all the susy extensions of the sm . in this model , two higgs doublets @xmath6 and @xmath7 give masses to up- and down - type fermions . the higgs sector consists of three neutral higgs bosons , one @xmath0-odd particle ( @xmath8 ) , two @xmath0-even particles ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , and a pair of charged higgs bosons ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , these higgs bosons have not been directly explored experimentally until now .",
    "the lep experiments provided lower mass bounds as : for the sm higgs boson @xmath12 ( at @xmath13 c.l . ) , and for the mssm bosons @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 ( at @xmath13 c.l.)@xcite .",
    "recently , a possible high - energy collider in @xmath17-@xmath18 collision mode at the lhc , the large hadron - electron collider ( lhec ) , has been sketched@xcite .",
    "there will exist a rich physics program@xcite .",
    "the lhec can be used to accurately determine the parton dynamics and the momentum distributions of quarks and gluons in the proton , and furthermore it may play a significant role in the discovery and interpretation of new physics .",
    "the incoming proton beam at the lhec has an energy @xmath19 and the energy of incoming electron is considered as @xmath20 according to several scenarios , with the center - of - mass system energy of @xmath21 .",
    "it seems that the lhec provides a cleaner environment than a hadron - hadron collider in accessing the couplings of the higgs boson to gauge bosons .",
    "the production channel @xmath22 , a neutral current ( nc ) process at the lhec , attracted the physicist s attentions . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is pointed out that the electron reconstruction in the nc process is superior with respect to that of the missing neutrino in the charged current process , @xmath23 , and the nc process has the potential to increase the overall higgs boson signal efficiency , and there they studied the use of forward jet tagging as a means to secure the observation of the higgs boson in the @xmath24 decay mode and to significantly improve the purity of the signal .",
    "the qcd next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections to the sm higgs productions of @xmath25 and @xmath26 processes at the lhec were calculated by b. jger in ref.@xcite . moreover , not only does this channel provide a spectacular signature ( @xmath27 ) , but also the lightest higgs @xmath9 production in mssm via vector boson fusion with unusual visible decays is possible@xcite .",
    "the coupling strength of the lightest higgs @xmath9 with @xmath28 is distinguished from the sm higgs one with an additional factor @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is related to the ratio of the vacuum expectation values and @xmath31 is the mixing angle of the two cp - even higgs states .",
    "therefore , we may disentangle between the sm higgs and the light mssm cp - even higgs by measuring the cross section for @xmath32 at the lhec when @xmath33 is smaller than 1 . besides , in order to find new physics it requires sufficiently precise predictions for the new physics signals and their backgrounds with multiple final particles which can not be separated in experimental data entirely .",
    "therefore , the higher order qcd predictions for these reactions are necessary .    in this paper , we calculate the full qcd nlo corrections to the process @xmath22 at the lhec and estimate the capability of the lhec to access the light mssm @xmath0-even higgs boson in the @xmath34 production .",
    "the numerical results at the leading - order ( lo ) are compared with those in ref.@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we describe the technical details of the related lo and qcd nlo calculations in both the sm and the mssm in secs .",
    "ii and iii , respectively . in sec .",

    ", we neglect the u- , d- , c- , s - quark masses ( @xmath35 ) , and do not consider the partonic processes with incoming ( anti)bottom - quark due to the heavy ( anti)bottom - quark suppression in parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of proton .",
    "that means we involve the contributions of the following partonic processes in our lo calculations : @xmath36 where @xmath37 represent the four - momenta of the incoming electron , partons , and the outgoing electron , @xmath9-boson and jet , respectively .",
