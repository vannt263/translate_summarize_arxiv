    "the general relativity proposed by einstein is the theory describing the gravity . in order to verify the general relativity ,",
    "many experiments have been done up to now and there is nothing indicating the failure of this theory .",
    "however , the most of these experiments are performed in the weak gravitational field , such as the solar system .",
    "this means that the gravitational theory in the strong gravitational field is still unconstrained by the astronomical observations .",
    "namely , the gravitational theory might be different from the general relativity in the strong gravitational field .",
    "if so , one can probe the gravitational theory by observing the deviation from predictions in the general relativity .",
    "actually , the development of technology will enable us to observe the phenomena related to compact objects with high accuracy .",
    "such observations may be used as a test of the gravitational theory in the strong gravitational field .",
    "so far , many attempts and possibilities to test the gravitational theory in the strong gravitational field have been suggested @xcite .",
    "hopefully the reliable gravitational theory even in the strong gravitational field will be observationally revealed in the near future .",
    "the scalar - tensor gravity is a natural extension of the general relativity , and one of the simplest alternative gravitational theory , where the gravity is mediated by long - range scalar fields in addition to the usual tensor field in the general relativity @xcite .",
    "the scalar field plays an essential role in explaining the accelerated expansion phases of the universe , such as inflation scenario .",
    "additionally , the scalar - tensor theory in gravity can be obtained from the low energy limit of string and/or other gauge theories . in the scalar - tensor gravity",
    ", one adopts the basic assumption that the scalar and gravitational fields , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are coupled to matter via an effective metric defined as @xmath2 , where the function form of the conformal factor is still unclear .",
    "the brans - dicke theory is the simplest version of the scalar - tensor gravity , which assumes that @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the parameter in the conformal factor , @xmath4 , can be often connected to the brans - dicke parameter , @xmath5 , as @xmath6 , and the expected deviation from the general relativity becomes of the order @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the experiments in the solar system set severe constraints in the parameter , i.e. , @xmath8 or @xmath9 @xcite . on the other hand , damour and esposito - farese",
    "adopted the different function form of the conformal factor , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "then , they showed that the massive neutron stars in the scalar - tensor gravity can significantly deviate from the expectations in the general relativity @xcite . especially , they pointed out that the sudden deviation in the neutron star properties from the predictions in the general relativity is possible for the specific values of the coupling constants , even if the value of @xmath4 is considerably small .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as  spontaneous scalarization . \" subsequently , harada studied more details with the technique of catastrophe theory , and found that the spontaneous scalarization is possible for @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recently , freire _",
    "et al . _ have ruled out the parameter range of @xmath12 with the observations of the pulsar white dwarf binary @xcite .",
    "this constraint is quite strict , but we still have a little chance to see the spontaneous scalarization .",
    "so , we focus on the range of @xmath13 in this article .    until now ,",
    "several possibilities to distinguish the scalar - tensor gravity from the general relativity by using astronomical observations are suggested , e.g. , with the redshift lines of the x- and @xmath14-rays radiated from the surface of neutron stars @xcite and with the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted from neutron stars @xcite . in this article",
    ", we examine the different approach to probe the gravitational theory .",
    "that is , we focus on the rotational effect around neutron stars , where we especially consider the slowly rotating neutron stars with a uniform angular velocity @xcite . the similar analysis in the general relativity has been originally done by hartle @xcite , and subsequently a lot of studies associated with the stellar rotation have been examined . for instance , taking into account the rotational effect , the additional oscillation family referred as @xmath15-modes can be excited , and one might be possible to obtain the stellar information from their spectrum @xcite . in this sense , this article could become a first step to consider the rotational effect around relativistic stars in more complicated system in the scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "we should remark that the similar analysis in the tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) theory has been done @xcite .",
    "however , in such an analysis , they did not consider the dependence on the scalar coupling , because in teves the dependence on the vector coupling is stronger than that on the scalar coupling .",
    "in addition , for simplicity , they did not consider the dependence on the cosmological value of scalar field .",
    "so , in this article , we will see the dependence on the scalar coupling as well as the dependence on the cosmological value of scalar field , although the scalar - tensor gravity is one of the specific case in the teves .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we mention the fundamental parts of the scalar - tensor gravity and the equilibrium of non - rotating relativistic stars in the scalar - tensor gravity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , we derive the differential equation describing the frame dragging in the scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "additionally , we numerically show the rotational effect in this section .",
    "then , we make a conclusion in sec . [",

    ", we adopt the unit of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath19 .",
    "the scalar - tensor gravity is a natural extension of the general relativity , where the gravity is mediated not only by metric tensor but also by a massless scalar field @xmath0 .",
    "the total action of such a gravitational theory is given by @xcite @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the bare gravitational coupling constant , @xmath1 is the einstein metric , @xmath22 is the ricci scalar constructed with @xmath1 , @xmath23 represents matter fields collectively , and @xmath24 denotes the matter action , respectively .",
    "it is known that the formulation of field equations is better in  einstein frame \" described by the einstein metric . but a test particle moves on the geodesic in  jordan frame \" described by the metric @xmath25 , which is defined as @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "so , the jordan frame is often referred to as physical frame .",
    "hereafter , the quantities with asterisk are related to the einstein frame , while the quantities with tilde denote those in the physical frame .    by varying the total action @xmath27 with respect to @xmath1",
    ", one can obtain the field equation for the tensor field ; @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the energy - momentum tensor in the einstein frame , which is associated with that in the physical frame as @xmath30 similarly , by varying @xmath27 with respect to @xmath0 , one obtains the field equation for the scalar field ; @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the dalembertian of @xmath1 , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined as @xmath35 we should remark that the scalar - tensor gravity for @xmath36 reduces to the general relativity .",
    "in addition to eqs .",
    "( [ basic1 ] ) and ( [ basic2 ] ) , one gets another equation from the energy - momentum conservation law , i.e. , @xmath37 , such as @xmath38 especially , in this article , we adopt the same form of conformal factor @xmath39 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a real constant .",
    "thus , @xmath33 can be written as @xmath42 , and the scalar - tensor gravity with @xmath43 corresponds to the general relativity .",
    "the equilibrium configurations of non - rotating relativistic stars in the scalar - tensor gravity have been calculated in refs .",
    "the metric describing the static , spherically symmetric relativistic stars can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is corresponding to the mass function .",
    "therefore , the physical metric is @xmath47 we assume that the stellar matter is a perfect fluid , i.e. , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are the total energy density , the pressure , and the four - velocity of the fluid in physical frame , respectively .    using eqs .",
    "( [ basic1 ] ) , ( [ basic2 ] ) , and ( [ basic3 ] ) , one can obtain the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations in the scalar - tensor gravity @xcite , such as @xmath52         - \\frac{2(r-\\mu)}{r(r-2\\mu)}\\psi , \\\\    \\tilde{p } ' & = -\\left(\\tilde{\\rho}+\\tilde{p}\\right)\\left[\\phi'+\\alpha\\psi\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath15 . in order to close the system of equations",

    "in order to examine the rotational effect around the relativistic stars in the scalar - tensor gravity , we consider the slowly rotating relativistic objects with a uniform angular velocity . from the einstein equations ,",
    "we derive a second order differential equation governing the frame dragging , and solve it numerically with appropriate boundary conditions . as a result , we find that , similarly in the general relativity , the total angular momentum is proportional to the angular velocity for the slowly rotation . additionally , we find that the spontaneous scalarization can arise in the rotational effects as well as the other stellar properties for @xmath90 , where @xmath80 denotes the cosmological value of scalar field . on the other hand , for @xmath87 , we can observe the deviation from the general relativity in a wide range of the coupling constant @xmath41 . comparing the results in this article with those in the case of teves , we find that the dependence on the gravitational theory is completely different . especially , we find the obvious difference in the momentum of inertia .",
