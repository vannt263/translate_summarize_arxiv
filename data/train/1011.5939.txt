    "<S> we prove that if @xmath0 , for @xmath1 , is an ahlfors - david regular product set of sufficiently large hausdorff dimension , denoted by @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is a sufficiently regular function , then the upper minkowski dimension of the set @xmath4 does not exceed @xmath5 , in line with the regular value theorem from the elementary differential geometry . </S>",
    "<S> our arguments are based on the mapping properties of the underlying fourier integral operators and are intimately connected with the falconer distance conjecture in geometric measure theory . </S>",
    "<S> we shall see that our results are , in general , sharp in the sense that if the hausdorff dimension is smaller than a certain threshold , then the dimensional inequality fails in a quantifiable way . </S>",
    "<S> the constructions used to demonstrate this are based on the distribution of lattice points on convex surfaces and have connections with combinatorial geometry . </S>"
