    "the quantum entanglement of a many - body system has been paid much attention since the entanglement is considered as the heart in quantum information and computation  @xcite . as the bipartite entanglement measurement in a pure state , the von neumann entropy  @xcite in the antiferromagnetic anisotropic spin chain  @xcite and isotropic spin chain  @xcite",

    "a typical example is that osborne solved exactly one - dimensional infinite - lattice transverse - field ising model to obtain entropy by the jordan - wigner transform .",
    "the entropy predicts the quantum phase transition successfully  @xcite .",
    "moreover , another concept from quantum information science , the ground state fidelity has been used to qualify quantum phase transitions in the last few years  @xcite .",
    "because the fidelity is a measure of similarity between states , the fidelity should drop abruptly at critical points as a consequence of the dramatic changes in the structure of the ground states , regardless of what type of internal order is present in quantum many - body states .",
    "this result is the orthogonality of different ground states due to state distinguishability .",
