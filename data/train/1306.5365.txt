    "the hilbert - huang transform ( hht ) , which consists of an empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) followed by the hilbert spectral analysis , was developed recently by [ @xcite @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "it presents a fundamentally new approach to the analysis of time series data .",
    "its essential feature is the use of an adaptive time - frequency decomposition that does not impose a fixed basis set on the data , and therefore , unlike fourier or wavelet analysis , its application is not limited by the time - frequency uncertainty relation .",
    "this leads to a highly efficient tool for the investigation of transient and nonlinear features .",
    "the hht is applied in various fields , including materials damage detection @xcite and biomedical monitoring @xcite .",
    "several laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors have been designed and built to detect gravitational waves directly .",
    "they include ligo @xcite in the us , virgo @xcite in europe , and kagra ( lcgt ) @xcite in japan .",
    "the direct detection of gravitational waves is important not only because it will help to investigate various unsolved astronomical problems and to find new objects that can not be seen by other observational methods , but it will also be a new tool with which to verify general relativity and other theories in a strong gravitational field .",
    "these detectors are sensitive over a wide frequency band , a range of between about 10 hz and a few khz , and they have the ability to observe the waveform of a gravitational wave , which would contain astrophysical information .",
    "there are several kinds of data analysis schemes that are being developed and applied to observational data .",
    "since gravitational waves are considered to be faint and gravitational wave detectors produce a great variety of nonlinear and transient noise , an efficient data analysis scheme is required .",
    "the hht has the promise of being a powerful new tool to extract the signal from the noise of the detector .    in the hht",
    ", the emd first decomposes the data into intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) , each representing a locally monochromatic frequency scale of the data .",
    "summing over all the imfs will recover the original data .",
    "then , the hilbert spectral analysis derives the instantaneous amplitude ( ia ) and instantaneous frequency ( if ) from the analytical complex representation of each imf ; the imf itself and the hilbert transform of the imf are the real and imaginary parts , respectively .",
    "the ia is obtained by taking the absolute value , and the if is obtained by differentiating the phase .",
    "we consider the application of the hht to the search for the signal of gravitational waves [ @xcite @xcite ; @xcite ] [ @xcite @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "it is necessary to determine some parameters in the emd component of the hht , and in this paper we propose and evaluate a method to determine the optimal values of the parameters to use in the search for gravitational waves .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we briefly give an overview of the hht . in secs .",
    "3 and 4 , we propose and demonstrate our method , as described above .",
    "we summarize our work in sec .",
    "in this section , we offer a brief introduction of the two hht components : the hilbert spectral analysis and the emd .",
    "we will show that the hilbert transform can lead to an apparent time - frequency - energy description of a time series",
    ". however , this description may not be consistent with physically meaningful definitions of if and ia , since the hilbert transform is based on cauchy s integral formula of holomorphic functions that tend to zero sufficiently quickly at infinity .",
    "the emd , however , can generate components of the time series for which the hilbert transform can lead to physically meaningful definitions of these two instantaneous quantities . hence , the combination of the emd and the hilbert transform provides a more physically meaningful time - frequency - energy description of a time series .",
    "we will assume that the input @xmath0 is given by sampling a continuous signal at discrete times , @xmath1 for @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of the development of the hht is to provide an alternative view of the time - frequency - energy paradigm of data . in this approach",
    ", the nonlinearity and nonstationarity can be dealt with better than by using the traditional paradigm of constant frequency and amplitude .",
    "one way to express the nonstationarity is to find the if and ia , which is why the hilbert spectral analysis was included as a part of the hht .",
    "the hilbert transform of a function @xmath0 is defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the cauchy principal value of the singular integral and the convolution , respectively .",
    "if a function @xmath0 belongs the lebesgue space @xmath6 for @xmath7 , the hilbert transform is well - defined and @xmath8 is the boundary value of a holomorphic function @xmath9 in the upper half - plane .",
    "then the ia @xmath10 and the instantaneous phase function @xmath11 are defined by @xmath12 the if @xmath13 is given by @xmath14    however , the if obtained using this method is not necessarily physically meaningful unless the time series data @xmath0 is a monocomponent signal or a narrow - band signal @xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is the sum of two sinusoidals , @xmath15 , where the amplitudes @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are positive constants , the if varies with the time and may become negative although the signal is analytic . to explore the applicability of the hilbert transform , @xcite showed that the necessary conditions to define a meaningful if are that the functions are symmetric with respect to the local zero mean and that they each have the same number of zero crossings and extrema .",
    "thus they applied the emd to the original data @xmath0 to decompose it into imfs and a residual .",
    "a more detailed description is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : emd ] .",
    "the empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) has an implicit assumption that , at any given time , the data may have many coexisting oscillatory modes of significantly different frequencies , one superimposed on the other .",
    "for each of these modes , we define an intrinsic mode function ( imf ) that satisfies the following conditions :    1 .",
    "for all the imfs of the data set , the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must either be equal or differ at most by one .",
    "2 .   at any data point , the mean values of the upper and the lower envelopes defined by using the local maxima and the local minima , respectively , are zero .    with the above definition of an imf",
    ", we can then decompose any function through the emd , which , in a sense , is a sifting process using a series of high - pass filters .",
    "the algorithm is summarized in the following outline and fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] shows a schematic example of emd sifting :    * @xmath20 * for @xmath21 to @xmath22 + + [ cols= \" < \" , ]    * residual : @xmath23    the parameter @xmath22 specifies the number of imfs to be extracted from @xmath0 , which is usually based on the characteristics of the signal",
    ". the parameter @xmath24 must be sufficiently large , several thousand or more , since it determines when the mode decomposition stops even if the stoppage criterion has not been satisfied .",
    "the emd starts with identifying all the local extrema and then connecting all the local maxima ( minima ) by a cubic spline to form the upper ( lower ) envelope . in [ app:1 ]",
    "we review the details of the algorithm of extrema finder ( xf 0 , 1 , and 2 ) that we use to identify the local extrema .",
    "the upper and lower envelopes usually encompass all the data between them .",
    "their mean is @xmath25 .",
    "the difference between the input @xmath0 and @xmath25 is the first proto - mode , @xmath26 , that is , @xmath27 . by construction , @xmath28 is expected to satisfy the definition of an imf .",
    "however , that is usually not the case since changing a local zero from a rectangular to a curvilinear coordinate system may introduce new extrema , and further adjustments are needed .",
    "therefore , a repeat of the above procedure is necessary .",
    "the emd serves two purposes :    1 .   to eliminate the background waves on which the imf is riding ; 2 .   to make the wave profiles more symmetric .",
    "the process of the emd has to be repeated as many times as is necessary to make the extracted signal satisfy the definition of an imf . in the iterating processes ,",
    "@xmath26 is treated as a proto - imf , which is then treated as data in the next iteration : @xmath29 .",
    "after @xmath30 iterations , the approximate local envelope symmetry condition is satisfied , and @xmath31 becomes the imf @xmath32 , that is , @xmath33 .    the approximate local envelope symmetry condition of the emd is called the stoppage criterion .",
    "several different types of stoppage criteria have been adopted .",
    "one is a criterion determined by using the cauchy type of convergence test , which was used in @xcite : @xmath34 with a predetermined value @xmath35 .",
    "this stoppage criterion appears to be mathematically rigorous , but because how small is small enough begs an answer , it is difficult to implement .",
    "the second type of criterion , termed the @xmath36 stoppage , was proposed in [ @xcite @xcite , @xcite ] . with this type of stoppage criterion ,",
    "the emd stops only after the numbers of zero crossings and extrema are :    1 .",
    "equal or differ at most by one ; 2 .",
    "stay the same for @xmath36 consecutive times .",
    "extensive tests by @xcite suggest that the optimal range for @xmath36 should be between 3 and 8 , but the lower number is favored .",
    "obviously , any selection is _ ad hoc _ , and a rigorous justification is needed .",
    "thus in sec .",
    "[ sec : pm ] , we propose a policy to justify the stoppage criteria .",
    "the first imf should contain the finest scale or the shortest - period oscillation in the signal , which can be extracted from the data by @xmath37 .",
    "the residue , @xmath38 , contains the longer - period oscillations .",
    "this residual is then treated as a new data source and , in order to obtain the imf of the next lowest frequency , it is subjected to the same process of the emd as described above . the procedure is repeatedly applied to all subsequent @xmath39 , and the result is @xmath40 .",
    "the decomposition process finally stops when the residue , @xmath39 , becomes a monotonic function or a function with only one extremum from which no more imf can be extracted .",
    "thus , the original data are decomposed into @xmath41 imfs and a residue , @xmath39 , which can be either the adaptive local median or trend : @xmath42 .",
    "the emd can be applied to observed data in order to decompose it into signal and noise . in the original form of the emd",
    ", however , mode mixing frequently appears . by definition",
    ", mode mixing occurs when either a single imf consists of signals of widely disparate scale , or when signals of a similar scale reside in different imf components .",
    "it is a consequence of signal intermittency , which can not only cause serious aliasing in the time - frequency distribution , but can also make the individual imfs devoid of physical meaning . to overcome this drawback , @xcite proposed the ensemble emd ( eemd ) , which defines the true imf components as the mean of an ensemble of trials , each consisting of the signal plus a white ( gaussian ) noise of finite standard deviation ( finite amplitude ) .",
    "the eemd algorithm contains the following steps :    1 .",
    "add a white ( gaussian ) noise series to the targeted data ; 2 .",
    "decompose the data with added white noise into imfs ; 3 .",
    "repeat steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) multiple times but with a different white ( gaussian ) noise series each time ; 4 .   obtain the ensemble means of the corresponding imfs of the decompositions .",
    "the standard deviation of the white ( gaussian ) noise @xmath43 is not necessarily small . on the other hand , the number of trials , @xmath44 , must be large .    with the emd",
    ", the signal usually appears in the imf @xmath45 with a small value of @xmath46 , typically @xmath21 , while it shifts to @xmath47 for the eemd . since in the eemd @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "contain only noise , we specify @xmath50 in this paper .",
    "we consider the application of hhts to the search for gravitational waves .",
    "there are several decisions that must first be made before conducting either the emd or the eemd .",
    "first we compare three kinds of extrema finders , xf 0 , 1 and 2 as algorithms to identify the local extrema , the details of which are described in [ app:1 ] .",
    "we must also choose the stoppage criterion @xmath35 or @xmath36 and , for the eemd , the standard deviation @xmath43 of the white ( gaussian ) noise to be added to each trial .",
    "moreover , we need to find the optimal value of some of these parameters .",
    "thus , in this section , we present a method to find the optimal values of the parameters .",
    "we prepared analytic time series data by combining gaussian noise with a sine - gaussian signal , which is often used to model of gravitational wave bursts , as follows : @xmath51    \\sin \\phi(t ) + n(t ) , \\label{eq : sgn}\\ ] ] where we let @xmath52 sec .",
    "for the frequency of the signal , we considered the two cases :    1 .",
    "constant frequency , where the phase @xmath53 and frequency @xmath54 are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "time - dependent frequency , where @xmath53 and @xmath57 are given by @xmath58    the noise @xmath59 was generated by gaussian random variates with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ fig : signal ] shows the signal @xmath61 of @xmath62 , the noise of @xmath63 and time series @xmath0 for @xmath62 ( snr = 20 ) and @xmath64 ( snr = 10 ) , where snr is defined by snr = @xmath65 ^ 2}/\\sigma$ ] .    for both the emd and eemd of the signal given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sgn ] ) , we wish to determine the optimal extrema finder ( xf 0 , 1 , or 2 ) , the optimal value of @xmath43 and the optimal stoppage criterion ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) . to examine the accuracy in calculation of the if , for each of algorithms and parameters with snr = 10 and 20 , we calculated the if for 400 samples , each of which was generated by adding a gaussian random variate with a different seed to the 0.5 second data .",
    "the sampling frequency of the data was 4096 hz . a description of how we determined the accuracy of the if is given in sec.[subsec : method ] .",
    "for the eemd , we chose the size of the ensemble to be @xmath66 .",
    "we tried other values of @xmath44 , and we verified that the results change little even with @xmath67 but that @xmath68 is too small .      in this subsection , we present a method to examine the accuracy of the if , which will determine the optimal values of the parameters .",
    "first , we performed the emd and eemd procedures for 400 samples of each data set with the signal given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sgn ] ) .",
    "we determined the optimal parameters for different signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ; snr = 10 or 20 ) , the algorithm of extrema finder ( xf 0 , 1 , or 2 ) to identify the local extrema , the stoppage criterion ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) of the emd , and the standard deviation ( @xmath71 ) of the white ( gaussian ) noise to be added to each trial when we performed the eemd .",
    "figure [ fig : ex - ia ] shows the ia of each imf for each data set using ( snr , xf , @xmath43 , @xmath35 ) = @xmath72 .",
    "note that only 30 samples are plotted in this and the following figures since the figures are not legible when all 400 samples are plotted . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ex - ia ] , it is apparent that imf3 has a peak for this parameter set . however , which of imfs catches the signal depends on the snr and the parameters used in the emd procedure .",
    "figure [ fig : ex - if ] shows the ifs of imf3 for these data .",
    "each of the lower figures shows a magnification of the upper one around the signal injection point ( @xmath73 sec ) .",
    "these figures indicate that the if displays the characteristics of the injected signal when the ia dominates over the noise level , while the if is physically meaningless during the other period .",
    "we make the linear and quadratic regression for the instantaneous frequency @xmath74 of each imf using the least squares method with weights @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the ia of the imf ;    1 .   the linear regression : @xmath77hz , 2 .   the quadratic regression : @xmath78hz ,    with fitting range @xmath79 or @xmath80 , that is , @xmath81 or @xmath82 , respectively .    for indices of the accuracy of fitting , we calculate the following quantities ;    * the relative error of fitting against the exact frequency : @xmath83}}{\\displaystyle { { \\rm wtss } \\big [ f_{\\rm sg}(t ) \\big]}},\\ ] ] where the weighted total sum of squares ( wtss ) is defined by @xmath84 } = \\sum_j a^2 ( t_j ) f^2 ( t_j ) .\\ ] ] * the deviation of the if for each imf @xmath85 around the exact frequency : @xmath86}}{\\displaystyle { { \\rm wtss } \\big [ f_{\\rm sg}(t ) \\big]}}.\\ ] ] * the coefficient of determination : @xmath87}}{\\displaystyle { { \\rm wtss } \\big [ f_{\\rm imf}(t ) \\big]}}.\\ ] ]    which imf includes the signal depends on the parameters .",
    "imf 1 always includes the signal for the emd , while imf 2 , 3 or 4 includes the signal for the eemd .",
    "thus , we consider the imf to include the signal if the relative error @xmath88 is the smallest for each parameter set .",
    "the deviation @xmath89 indicates how widely @xmath85 fluctuates around the exact frequency .",
    "even if the error of fitting @xmath88 is small , the procedure is considered unstable when @xmath89 is large .",
    "the coefficient of determination @xmath90 is a measure of the goodness of fitting .",
    "in general , @xmath91 if the regression line perfectly fits the data and @xmath92 indicates no relationship between @xmath85 and @xmath93 .",
    "that is , for the signal of time - dependent frequency , an @xmath90 near 1 indicates better fit . for the signal of constant frequency ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath90 approaches 0 as the fitting becomes better .",
    "in this section , we present the results of the simulation based on sec.[sec : pm ] .",
    "we calculate the if by means of the hht for 400 samples of each parameter set with each signal , make the linear and quadratic regression and compare calculated coefficients with the exact values , which are @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the signal of the constant frequency given by eq.([eq : cfpf ] ) and @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the signal of the time - dependent frequency given by eq.([eq : tdpf ] ) . here we use the xf 0 , 1 and 2 for the extrema finder and choose @xmath99 or @xmath100 , @xmath101 for the stoppage criteria . for the eemd , we also used the standard deviation of the added white ( gaussian ) noise of @xmath102 .    in the following tables , we show the mean values and the standard deviations for 400 samples of the coefficients of the fitting @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the relative error @xmath88 , the deviation of the if @xmath89 , and the coefficient of determination @xmath90 .",
    "first , to compare the emd and the eemd , the typical results of the linear and quadratic regression for signals of snr=20 and 10 with the constant frequency defined by eq.([eq : cfpf ] ) and the time - dependent frequency defined by eq.([eq : tdpf ] ) are shown in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "the results of the linear regression are listed if the column headed @xmath105 is blank , while the results of the quadratic regression are listed otherwise .",
    "the mean values of coefficients for snr=20 using the emd acceptably agree with the exact values , but the standard deviations of the coefficient and the value of @xmath89 tend to be large .",
    "it means that the ifs fluctuate widely and sometimes an inaccurate estimate of the if will be given .",
    "a typical example is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : if - fit ] .",
    "the if obtained with the emd fluctuate more widely than that with the eemd , while the dashed lines , which represent the linear regression , match very well with the frequency of injected signals , especially for snr=20 .",
    "the accuracy of the emd is inadequate for snr=10 .",
    "we found that the accuracy with the emd is not improved even with other extrema finder or other stoppage criterion . on the other hand ,",
    "the eemd gives better results with smaller standard deviations for signals for snr=20 . even for snr=10 ,",
    "the results are similar to or better than those of the emd for snr=20 .",
    "thus , hereinafter we consider only the eemd .",
    "secondly , we compare the algorithm of extrema finder xf 0 , 1 and 2 .",
    "some of the fitting coefficients for the signal calculating using the eemd with @xmath106 and the stoppage criterion with @xmath107 are listed in table [ tab02 ] .",
    "there is little significant difference among xf 0 , 1 and 2 for simple signals as we considered here . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : if - fit - xf ] , the difference between xf 0 and 1 is very small in particular",
    ". we found , however , that xf 2 sometimes becomes unstable with a small snr and a strict stoppage criterion , that is , a small value of @xmath35 for the cauchy type of convergence or a large value of @xmath36 for the s stoppage .",
    "although we show the results for the linear regression and the fitting range of @xmath108 with a specific parameter set in table [ tab02 ] , it is generally the case with the quadratic regression , with fitting range of @xmath109 or with other parameter sets .",
    "next , let us consider effects of @xmath43 , the standard deviation of the white gaussian noise to be added to make ensembles for the eemd .",
    "the coefficients of the linear regression for the signal of the constant frequency and the time - dependent frequency calculating using the eemd with xf=0 , the @xmath107 stoppage criterion and @xmath110 through @xmath111 are listed in table [ tab03 ] .",
    "those for the signal of the time - dependent frequency are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : if - fitsig ] .",
    "although the dependence of the accuracy on @xmath43 is rather weak , the best value of @xmath43 is near @xmath112 for snr=20 , while it is @xmath113 for snr=10 .",
    "each of them corresponds to the amplitude @xmath114 of the signal defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sgn ] ) , that is , @xmath115 and @xmath116 for snr=20 and 10 , respectively .",
    "it is the case with the quadratic regression and/or with the fitting range of @xmath117 , too .",
    "this result implies that we should perform the eemd with some different values of @xmath43 to search and analyze a signal whose amplitude is not known in advance .",
    "finally , we will compare stoppage criteria .",
    "the coefficients for the same signal as table [ tab01 ] calculated with xf 0 , @xmath106 adopting the s stoppage criteria of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and the cauchy type of convergence test with @xmath120 are shown in table [ tab04 ] .",
    "inadequate accuracies are obtained with @xmath121 .",
    "the accuracy sometimes get worse with more rigid criterion , or with small value of @xmath35 , especially for snr=10 .",
    "it is because mode mixing occurs to a certain extent as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iaimf ] , which plots the ias of imf3 and imf4 calculated with @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and @xmath107 and @xmath119 for the snr=10 signal of the time - dependent frequency .",
    "the fact that the ias of imf4 for @xmath124 and @xmath123 are comparable to those of imf3 indicates mode mixing .",
    "the s stoppage criteria of @xmath125 and @xmath119 is likely to be stable .",
    "note that @xmath126 ( the first derivative of frequency ) in the case of time - dependent frequency for the snr=10 is always estimated smaller because of the noise effects and lower snr .",
    "althoug we presented the results of the linear regression with fitting range @xmath79 for the most part , they are the same in all essentials as those of the quadratic regression and/or with fitting range @xmath127",
    ". for further tables of all results , refer to @xcite .",
    "we investigated the possibility of the application of the hht to the search for gravitational waves .",
    "since emd and eemd are an empirical method , there are some parameters to be chosen . in this paper , we proposed and demonstrated a method to look for optimal values of these parameters .",
    "we found that the most important parameter is the stoppage criterion @xmath35 or @xmath36 for emd and eemd .",
    "the strict criterion is generally adequate .",
    "however , it sometimes causes mode mixing and always requires long cpu time , as shown in table [ tabcpu ] .",
    "selection of extrema finder xf affects required cpu time considerably , while it does not affect calculated ifs so much .",
    "cpu time with xf 1 is twice or more as long as that with xf 0 , and xf 2 requires still longer cpu time .",
    "the dependence of the accuracy of the ifs on @xmath43 , the magnitude of the gaussian noise to be added to each trial of the eemd , is weak .",
    "the best value of @xmath43 is determined by the amplitude of the signal rather than by the noise level .    as a result ,",
    "eemd with the following optimal parameter ranges may be promising : extrema finder of xf 0 ; the stoppage criterion of @xmath128@xmath129 , or @xmath130 ; the standard deviation of the gaussian noise @xmath131@xmath112 .",
    "we used a time series data that combined gaussian noise with a sine - gaussian signal , but the time series data from the detectors of gravitational waves have many non - gaussian and nonstationary noise .",
    "therefore , the parameter ranges discussed in this paper can not be used in a straightforward manner in the search for real gravitational waves . however , using the ` playground data ' method ( which usually uses 10% of the real data to fix the search parameters and to estimate the noise background ) , we can determine the optimal values of these parameters using our proposed method .",
    "based on this research , we will investigate the possibility of constructing an alert system using the hht for the search for gravitational waves @xcite .",
