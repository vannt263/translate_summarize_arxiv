    "deep and wide area x - ray surveys ( e.g. ,  alexander et  al . 2003 ; lehmer et  al . 2005 ; kim et  al . 2007 ;",
    "elvis et  al .",
    "2009 ; watson et  al . 2009 ; xue et  al .",
    "2010 ) have resolved up to @xmath5  90% of the x - ray background into discrete sources over the 0.58  kev band ( e.g. ,  lumb et  al .",
    "2002 ; moretti et  al . 2003 ; bauer et  al . 2004",
    "; worsley et  al . 2005 ; hickox & markevitch 2006 ) .",
    "the majority of the objects detected in these surveys are luminous x - ray sources at @xmath6  0.25 with @xmath7  erg  s@xmath3 ( e.g.,hornschemeier et  al . 2001 ; barger 2003 ; brandt & hasinger 2005 ; treister et  al .",
    "2005 ; silverman et  al . 2010 ) .",
    "many of these luminous x - ray sources are clearly active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , as demonstrated by the detection of either optical agn signatures ( i.e.,broad emission lines and/or narrow high - excitation emission lines ; e.g. ,  barger et  al .",
    "2002 ; szokoly et  al . 2004 ) or hard x - ray spectra ( @xmath8 ; mushotzky et  al .",
    "2000 ; giacconi et  al .",
    "however , a significant fraction of these luminous x - ray sources display optical spectroscopic signatures consistent with star formation ( e.g. ,  barger et  al . 2002 ; szokoly et  al .",
    "2004 ; eckart et  al .",
    "2006 ; trouille et  al .",
    "the luminous x - ray emission could be due to either agn activity where the optical spectroscopic signatures are extinguished or diluted ( e.g.,moran et  al .",
    "2002 ; maiolino et  al .",
    "2003 ; goulding & alexander 2009 ) , or star formation activity .",
    "these objects are distinct from the population of x - ray dim , normal , star forming galaxies now being revealed in deep high-@xmath9 surveys ( e.g. , lehmer et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "if confirmed as star forming galaxies , then these luminous x - ray sources will be the most powerful starburst galaxies known ( with @xmath10@xmath11  erg  s@xmath3 ) , exceeding the x - ray luminosity of the brightest star forming galaxies in the local universe by over an order of magnitude ( e.g. ,  moran et  al .",
    "1999 ; zezas et  al . 2001 ; lira et  al . 2002 ; ptak et  al .",
    "however , accurately characterising the x - ray emission from these distant luminous x - ray sources is challenging due to their faint fluxes and therefore limited x - ray photon statistics .",
    "greater insight into their nature can be gained by selecting the rare nearby ( @xmath12 @xmath13 0.15 ) examples of these luminous x - ray sources where the photon statistics are much improved ( e.g. ,  horschemeier et  al .",
    "the advantages of this approach are twofold ; firstly the accurate characterisation of the x - ray emission via x - ray spectral and variability analyses , and secondly the accurate characterisation of the optical spectroscopic signatures .",
    "in this paper we present _ xmm - newton _ data and detailed analyses of three x - ray luminous galaxies at @xmath6  0.1 .",
    "these targets were selected from the @xmath5  80  deg@xmath14 overlap between the pre - release version of the source catalogue of the _ xmm - newton  _  serendipitous survey ( 2xmmp - dr0 ) and the sloan digital sky survey data 5 ( sdss - dr5 ) .",
    "the aim of this study is simply to determine whether the x - ray emission is powered by star formation , or by agn activity .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we give details about the source selection criteria .",
    "the x - ray observations used in this study are described in section 3 , along with the data reduction details . in section 4 , we describe the results of the spatial , spectral , and timing analyses performed on the x - ray data for each source . in section 5 , we discuss the results , and finally , we conclude the paper in section 6 . throughout this work , we assume the values @xmath15 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "as an initial step , we cross - correlated the sdss dr5 and 2xmmp - dr0 catalogues . from the large number of cross - matches we then selected x - ray sources that were identified with galaxies possessing star formation dominated sdss optical spectra , with no clear agn signature .",
    "the criteria used included , for example , strong narrow emission lines , low [ sii]/h@xmath18and [ oiii]/h@xmath19 ratios , and underlying continua dominated by young stars .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      our final set of diagnostics are taken from studying possible variations of both the x - ray flux and x - ray spectral shape between the different observation epochs , which are separated by gaps of months to years .",
    "again , we would expect to see little variation from spatially extended x - ray emission regions composed of many components such as a starburst region , whereas agn can vary both temporally and spectrally over such timescales ( e.g. taylor , uttley & mchardy 2003 ; sobolewska & papadakis 2009 )",
    ".    within the spectral data analysed above we do see evidence for spectral variability between different observation epochs .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] in which we present the four different spectra of j140052.5 - 014510 with residuals ( pn only in the three _ xmm - newton  _ datasets , for the sake of clarity ) , and compare each spectrum to the model best fitting to the obs i d 9557 _ chandra  _ data .",
    "clearly the spectra in the top three panels deviate from the shape of the last spectrum , demonstrating some degree of variability in the data .",
    "we investigate whether this is due to strong variability in the underlying spectral shape in the top three panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , where we compare the measured values of the photon indices between the different observations .",
    "it is clear that the best fitting values indicate that the spectrum of j140052.5 - 014510 does vary significantly , over periods as short as months .",
    "it is less clear whether this is the case for the other objects ; their power - law photon indices are at least consistent at the 2@xmath20 level ( or better ) over their observations .",
    "the long - term luminosity variations are presented as the bottom three panels , where the luminosity is calculated from the fluxes in table  [ tab : plfits ] for the hard spectrum source j123719.3 + 114915 , and @xmath21 for the other two objects . ] .",
    "all three objects clearly demonstrate significant luminosity variations over timescales of months , consistent with relatively compact objects .",
    "the basic question posed at the beginning of this work was : what can power more than @xmath22 erg s@xmath3 of x - ray luminosity from a galaxy with no unambiguous signatures of agn activity ?",
    "we have examined this by selecting three galaxies at a redshift @xmath4 0.1 from sdss for further study at x - ray energies , based on the requisite high apparent x - ray luminosity and an optical spectrum betraying only signs of star formation processes .",
    "the work presented in the previous section details the results of several simple tests with the power to diagnose whether the x - ray emission originates in star formation processes , or an agn .",
    "we find that all three sources appear more consistent with agns than starbursts .",
    "firstly , all are point - like in the x - ray images ( cf .",
    "[ fig : figrad ] ; table  [ tab : tabpsf ] ) , although this is not convincing evidence in isolation given that the physical size limits on any extended component are of the order @xmath23 kpc at the distance of the galaxies , permitting at least compact nuclear starburst emission to be present .",
    "far more convincing evidence comes from the time variability characteristics of the x - ray emission , with flux variations of factors @xmath24 seen for all three objects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ; table  [ tab : plfits ] ) implying that at least 50% of the x - ray luminosity originates in a region no more than a few light - years across . in the specific case of j140052.5 - 014510 , we see its flux halving and then returning to its original value in a period of 6 hours in the _",
    "chandra  _ acis - s light curve , implying the x - ray emission originates from a solar system - sized object , which  for a luminosity around @xmath11 erg s@xmath3  has to be due to an agn .",
    "finally , the x - ray spectra of the three objects are all well - described by a power - law continuum , consistent with moderate quality agn data and not the strong emission line - dominated spectra seen from starbursts .",
    "it should be noted that this spectral deconvolution implies dominance by an agn - like component , but does not rule out a bright x - ray starburst .",
    "in fact , the 99% upper limits on the mekal thermal plasma contributions to each spectrum still allow for in the region of @xmath25 erg s@xmath3 of starburst - heated gas in j082042.4 + 205715 ( comparable to the thermal component seen in many ulirgs , e.g. franceschini et al .",
    "2003 ) , and up to @xmath26 erg s@xmath3 in j140052.5 - 014510 .",
    "an interesting alternative to an agn that could plausibly produce extreme x - ray luminosities without an agn - like optical signature is a hyperluminous x - ray source ( hlx , e.g. gao et al .",
    "2003 ) , the brightest of the off - nuclear ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , see roberts et al . 2007 ; feng & soria 2011 for reviews ) .",
    "the most luminous of these objects , eso 243 - 49 hlx-1 , is as bright as @xmath22 erg s@xmath3 in 0.3  10 kev x - rays at peak ( farrell et al .",
    "2009 ; servillat et al .",
    "2011 ) , and so if a similar object were located close to the nucleus of a moderate redshift galaxy it might indeed share the observational characteristics of the three objects in this work .",
    "however , such objects are rare compared to bona fide agns  only a handful of ulxs with @xmath27 are detected within 100 mpc in the 2xmm - dr1 catalogue ( walton et al .",
    "2011 ) , far fewer in number than agns in a similar volume ( e.g. ho 2008 ) , and with the exception of eso 243 - 49 hlx-1 ( which may itself be an accreted dwarf galaxy nucleus , e.g. soria et al . 2010 ) they are far less luminous than galactic nuclei .",
    "we therefore do not regard this as a likely nature for any of our objects .",
    "so if these objects are all agn - dominated in the x - rays , can we say anything about the type of agn from the x - ray data ?",
    "firstly , only one of the objects  j123719.3 + 114915  appears hard ( @xmath28 @xmath13 1.6 ) and perhaps relatively highly absorbed ( @xmath29 @xmath4 10@xmath30 @xmath31 during the observation 9558 ) , consistent with a classic type 2 object , although the poor quality of this data should be noted .",
    "the other two objects have much lower columns , with both constrained at @xmath32 @xmath31 , more consistent with type-1 agns .",
    "this is supported when the data are sufficiently good to place constraints on the presence of a neutral fe k line ; in both cases high equivalent width ( @xmath33 kev ) lines are ruled out , rejecting a strong reflection component originating in the torus of a type-2 agn ( e.g. awaki et al . 1991 ) .",
    "however , both have different spectral slopes , with j140052.5 - 014510 markedly softer than j082042.4 + 205715 . while the slope of j082042.4 + 205715 ( @xmath28 @xmath34 2 ) is fairly typical for type-1 agns ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 ) , the soft slope of j140052.5 - 014510 ( @xmath28 @xmath35 2 ) is more unusual , and consistent with slopes seen in some narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ; vaughan et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , there is no strong evidence of a distinct soft excess  as is seen in nls1s  in either object . a piece of optical evidence indicating the possible presence of nls1 activity is the line width of h@xmath19 emission . by definition ,",
    "nls1 galaxies emit h@xmath19 with line widths @xmath13 2000 km s@xmath3 ( wang & zhang 2007 ) .",
    "we found that the three sources emit h@xmath19 at widths considerably lower than this upper limit ( @xmath13 300 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , these line widths are also consistent with those of star forming galaxies .",
    "so why is there no signature of agn activity in these objects optical spectra ?",
    "a number of reasons for this have been suggested in previous work focused on the nature of so - called elusive agns , i.e. , sources that show no signs of agn activity in the optical regime , but display signs of agn activity in the x - ray band .",
    "one possibility is that the regions within the galaxy producing narrow and broad line emission typically seen in agns have been rendered invisible by obscuration .",
    "for example , obscuration of agn activity within ngc 4945 by a heavy dusty torus was deduced by iwasawa et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "obscuration of the narrow line region may also be caused by spherical gas clouds shrouding the nuclei of galaxies , such as pks 031208 ( comastri et al .",
    "however , obscuration is not necessarily caused by gas and dust close to the galactic nucleus .",
    "rigby et al . ( 2006 ) reported that from a sample of 31 agns at redshifts of 0.5 @xmath13 @xmath12 @xmath13 0.8 , only the most face - on galaxies displayed optical agn activity .",
    "this implies that the obscuration of both the broad and narrow line regions may well be caused by host galaxy dust along our line of sight ( e.g. , moran et al .",
    "1996 ; rigby et al . 2006 ; goulding @xmath36 alexander 2009 ) .",
    "however , given that the x - ray spectral analysis of the three sources yielded hydrogen column density upper limit values @xmath37",
    "10@xmath38 @xmath31 , and that the calculated extinction values from the optical spectra for the galaxies are 1.11 mag @xmath13 a@xmath39 @xmath13 2.86 mag , obscuration is unlikely to be the cause for the elusiveness of optical agn signatures in the sources .",
    "another possibility is that the broad line regions ( blrs ) that should be signatures of agn activity may not be seen because of low accretion rates . according to nicastro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , agn blrs may form in disc winds at a critical distance within the accretion disc .",
    "this formation occurs at an accretion rate @xmath1 10@xmath40 @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "if the accretion rate is lower than this , the blr can not form . a recent study by trump et al .",
    "( 2011 ) deduced that the blr of an agn becomes invisible if the accretion rate drops below 10@xmath43 @xmath41 .",
    "this is because at such low accretion rates , radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs , yuan @xmath36 narayan 2004 ) occur and expand close to the inner radius of the accretion disc .",
    "riafs lack the optical / uv emission of an optically thick accretion disc and therefore can not ionise blrs ( yuan @xmath36 narayan 2004 ; trump et al .",
    "2011 ) . in order for a source to have an accretion rate lower than 10@xmath43 @xmath41 and to be displaying a luminosity of 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3",
    ", the mass of the accreting black holes would have to be @xmath35 8 @xmath44 10@xmath45 m@xmath46 . using the m-@xmath20 relation ( gultekin .",
    "2009 ) with emission values from the sdss dr7 archive , we estimated the masses of the black holes in the centre of the sources to be 5 @xmath44 10@xmath47 m@xmath46 , 3 @xmath44 10@xmath45 m@xmath46 , and 2 @xmath44 10@xmath47 m@xmath46 for j082042.4 + 205715 , j123719.3 + 114915 , and j140052.5 - 014511 , respectively . therefore , low levels of accretion activity is a possible explanation for the lack of the blrs in two of the three galaxies nuclei .",
    "one more possibility is that the agn activity has been optically diluted by starlight , and indeed star formation signatures , within the host galaxy .",
    "caccianiga et al ( 2007 ) found that from a sample of of 9 star forming optically elusive galaxies , all of their agn signatures were diluted by galactic starlight .",
    "a similar result was seen in the study of optically elusive agns by trump et al ( 2009 ) . in this study ,",
    "70% of the 48 optically elusive agn were diluted by galactic starlight .",
    "if we investigate the emission - line diagnostic diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bpt ] , we can see that all three sources flux ratios are positioned , in both cases , well below the kewley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) maximum starburst line ( it is worth reiterating that the transition region of the [ nii]/h@xmath18 diagnostic diagram does contain the flux ratios of pure star forming galaxies ) .",
    "it is likely that star formation in the galaxies has strengthened the h@xmath18 and h@xmath19 emission fluxes , thus diminishing the [ sii]/h@xmath18 , [ nii]/h@xmath18 , and [ oiii]/h@xmath19 values .",
    "if we remove the galactic star formation signatures , our objects would likely end up within the agn area of the diagram .",
    "thus , we conclude that the elusiveness of optical agn signatures within our galaxies is most likely due to dilution by stellar activity .",
    "our results are similar to those of jia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , where they investigate x - ray , optical , and infra - red properties of 6 lyman break analogue ( lba ) galaxies with optical line ratios similar those of our sources .",
    "they deduced that a combination of intense star formation and agn activity is likely present within the lbas by studying their multi - wavelength properties . unlike the work of jia et al .",
    ", we were able to deduce agn presence by looking at x - ray data alone , due to the superior quality of our x - ray data .",
    "nevertheless , both our results and those of jia et al .",
    "agree on the presence of agn activity and star formation within both galaxy samples .",
    "are galaxies that are both x - ray bright ( @xmath48 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) and display no clear optical signatures of agn activity truly powered by star formation ? or are these sources powered by an optically - hidden agn ? in an attempt to answer these questions , we have investigated the x - ray properties of 3 sources that were taken from a cross correlation of the sdss dr5 and 2xmmp dr0 catalogues , that have both no optical signatures of agn activity , x - ray luminosities exceeding 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 , and , crucially , relatively good x - ray data ( a few hundred to few thousands of counts ) .",
    "this investigation was performed using data from 9 observations of the three sources , taken using both _ xmm - newton  _ and _ chandra  _ .    to test for the presence of activity within these sources nuclei",
    ", we adopted 4 tests : point spread analysis , intra - observational variability analysis , spectral analysis , and long term spectral and timing variability analysis .",
    "investigating the point spread function of the 3 sources indicates that the sources x - ray emission in not extended .",
    "the compact nature of the sources is also evident in the long - term photon count rate variability of the three sources .",
    "j140052.5 - 014511 displays short term count rate variability ( during one _ chandra  _ observation ) , and long - term variability in its spectral shape , emphasising this source in particular must be very compact .",
    "all of this evidence points towards the three sources being x - ray powered by point - like objects .",
    "the spectral analysis of the sources indicates the lack of star formation emission from the three sources in the x - ray band .",
    "all three sources spectra are well fitted with a simple absorbed power - law model .",
    "when fit with an absorbed power - law plus mekal component model , @xmath1 90@xmath49 of the sources flux is constrained to be derived from the power - law component .",
    "note , however , that star formation may still be causing a very small proportion of x - ray emission within the nuclei of the galaxies .",
    "the results yielded from the x - ray studies of the sources infers the presence of agn activity within the galaxies nuclei .",
    "but why are these agns optically elusive ?",
    "a number of possibilities have been suggested as to the cause of this optical elusiveness .",
    "the most likely cause for this elusiveness is that the agns are being optically diluted by stellar emission from within their host galaxies .    at the beginning of this study",
    ", we asked whether galaxies with x - ray luminosities @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 and that display no signs of agn activity in the optical band are truly powered by star formation , or are they powered by a hidden agn . by studying the x - ray properties of three medium redshift objects that display these characteristics",
    ", we have discovered that such galaxies are indeed powered by agn activity .",
    "therefore , we have deduced that the common assumption that galaxies which display luminosities @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 host agns appears to be safe .",
