    "one may study the symmetries of the theory ( e.g. chiral perturbation theory ) in order to relate observables , or one can study its equations of motion ( e.g. dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) studies ) . finally , much progress has been made in recent years by actually evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq : aws path integral ] ) directly by discretizing it , as is done in lattice qcd .",
    "we have reported elsewhere on yet another technique , the so - called `` worldline variational approach '' , in which the path integral is approximated , in a rigorous and systematically correctable way , via a variational principle .",
    "this approach was initially applied to relativistic field theory in a scalar model  @xcite and more recently to quenched qed  @xcite .",
    "the common property that qed shares with qcd is that they are both renormalizable gauge field theories , in contrast to the scalar model which is super - renormalizable .",
    "of course qcd , even after quenching ( i.e. neglecting pair creation ) , differs from quenched qed by the fact that it is asymptotically free whereas quenched qed has a constant coupling .",
    "however , many of the above - mentioned approximative schemes for dealing with eq .",

    "it is interesting to note that for a value of @xmath5 around @xmath11 the various orders of perturbation theory appear to ` fan out ' .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that this effect arises because of a finite radius of convergence of the perturbation expansion .",
    "this would be unexpected : the general wisdom from hopt studies is that , as a first rough estimate , the @xmath12 order contribution to a perturbative expansion should scale roughly like the number of diagrams at that order . for the quenched qed propagator , the number of diagrams at order @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 and hence the radius of convergence (= @xmath15 ) of the perturbative expansion vanishes .",

    "it is , however , not a great surprise that @xmath23 is finite in this calculation as the rainbow approximation contains exactly one diagram at each order and hence does not reproduce the factorial growth ( eq .  [ eq : aws factorial growth ] ) in the number of diagrams .",
    "nevertheless , the coincidence of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is interesting and one wonders if it will persist in dyson - schwinger calculations when going beyond the rainbow approximation . also ,",

    "we shall discuss this , as well as the large order behaviour of the perturbative expansion of @xmath27 , below .",
    "it is important to note that in this case a finite radius of convergence is not a trivial result of the approximation , as it was for rainbow qed : it can be shown  @xcite that each diagram , at any order in perturbation theory , is represented in some approximate way within the variational approximation ; i.e. a perturbative expansion of @xmath27 would receive contributions from @xmath28 diagrams at order @xmath13 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : aws gamvar ] ) is an implicit equation for @xmath27 which can easily be solved numerically for arbitrary @xmath5 .",

    "[ fig : aws branch cut ] we show a plot of the ( negative ) real part of @xmath16 as a function of the ( complex ) coupling .",

    "one obtains that the branchpoints are located at @xmath32 , which yields a radius of convergence for the perturbation expansion of @xmath27 of @xmath33 .",
    "the radius of convergence of the perturbative expansion of the anomalous mass dimension can also be obtained , of course , by directly examining the behaviour of its expansion coefficients at large orders , i.e. if we expand @xmath34 then radius of convergence is given by @xmath35 for @xmath13 up to @xmath36 , it is possible to obtain these expansion coefficients by direct substitution of eq .",

    "( 50,50)(-65,00 )    the slow rate of convergence , as well as its non - uniformity , is clearly visible in this figure .",

    "these values of @xmath39 may be compared to the equivalent expansion coefficients obtained from the dyson - schwinger equation result : @xmath50 in fact , the variational result and the rainbow dyson - schwinger result for the @xmath39 s are surprisingly similar , not only in their functional form but even in the numerical coefficients .",
    "the main difference is the occurance of the sine function in the former .",
    "it is because of this sine that the branchcut , which for @xmath20 lies on the real axis , has moved into the complex plane for @xmath27 .",
    "in this contribution we have compared predictions for the anomalous mass dimension of quenched qed obtained through the use of a variety of techniques : the worldline variational approach , perturbation theory up to @xmath51 $ ] ( as well as a pad estimate for the @xmath52 $ ] term ) , rainbow dyson - schwinger equation studies and general expectations from studies of high order perturbation theory .",
    "both the rainbow dse s and the variational approach yield a cut in @xmath16 as a function of the coupling . in the former",
    "this cut is on the real axis , and is associated with chiral symmetry breaking , while in the latter it has moved ( a long way ) off the real axis , so that in that calculation there is no obvious sign of chiral symmetry breaking . in either case , the cuts necessitate a finite radius of convergence for the perturbative expansion of @xmath3 , and one can argue that circumstantial evidence for this may be seen in the perturbative result as well .",
    "general expectations from hopt , on the other hand , suggest that the radius of convergence should be zero .",
    "clearly , as quenched qed is the prototype gauge theory for the investigation of chiral symmetry breaking , efforts should be made to clarify these disagreements .",
    "it may even be the case that the eventual resolution of these issues will teach us something about the limitations of one or more of these approximate techniques for dealing with nonperturbative gauge field theories .",
