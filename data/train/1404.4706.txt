    "surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) describe electromagnetic collective modes of electrons propagating at the interface between a conductor and a dielectric , which are evanescently confined in the perpendicular direction .",
    "spps show potential applications in the fields of subwavelength optics,@xcite near - field optics,@xcite and photonic data storage.@xcite however , even noble metals with high conductivities ( e.g. gold or silver ) , which are widely regarded as traditional plasmonic materials , suffer from large ohmic losses at high frequencies.@xcite the large losses hinder the development of devices based on spps , thus materials with low losses are required.@xcite recently , researchers have shown that dirac materials ( e. g. graphene ) are suitable candidates for plasmonic applications , with lower loss compared to noble metals.@xcite besides , the spps in dirac materials have a number of advantages such as frequency tunability with gate voltage , tight confinement due to shorter wavelength , long lifetime , strong light - matter coupling.@xcite recently , experimentalists have successfully detected the real - space images of plasmon in tailored graphene nanostructures by infrared nano - imaging techniques.@xcite recent experimental verification of tunability of graphene plasmons have greatly stimulated the research interests of plasmons in dirac systems.@xcite     +    topological insulators(tis ) are a new class of dirac systems with both insulating bulk and metallic surface ( edge ) states which attract great interest in recent years.@xcite the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy(arpes ) experiments have demonstrated that bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 , bi@xmath2se@xmath3 and bi@xmath2te@xmath3 are three dimentional tis .",
    "@xcite the gapless surface states in 3d tis are topological protected by the time - reversal symmetry(trs).@xcitethese gapless ti surface states possesses many peculiar characteristics , such as spin - momentum locking mechanism and topological magneto - electric effect .",
    "@xcite specifically , the spin - momentum locking mechanism of helical surface states leads to coupling transport of spin and charge,@xcite and novel spin - plasmon besides the charge - plasmon.@xcite moreover , a gap - opening term can be acquired by breaking the trs@xcite and leads to strong magneto - optical effect in these systems.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate the coupling features between a dipole emitter and gapped tis surface states , and study the properties of spps which are bound on a gapped ti - vacuum interface .",
    "there are two specific characteristics of spps in the trs breaking tis surface states .",
    "firstly , we find a novel transverse type of spps besides the traditional longitudinal type . in specific",
    ", the s - polarization light can lead to a transverse spp due to the magneto - optical kerr effect , as shown in fig.1 ( b ) . besides , the p - polarization light can excite a longitudinal spp , similar to spp in traditional plasmonic meterials , as shown in fig.1 ( a ) .",
    "these two types of spps exhibit very short confinement ( 1 - 5 nm ) , relatively long propagation length .",
    "secondly , we consider the coupling between a single dipole emitter and the spps modes , as shown in fig.1 ( c)-(d ) .",
    "the decay rate can be enhanced by @xmath4 times compared to free space , due to the short confinement of spps .",
    "the high strength of coupling with the light makes ti materials be good platform for strong light - matter interactions .",
    "the structure of our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the expression of the optical conductivity from the massive dirac hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the magneto - optical kerr effect when applying an electric field to ti surface .",
    "further , we work out the fresnel reflected matrix . in sec iv",
    ", we obtain the dispersions of spps . in sec .",
    "v , we study the light - spp coupling in this system .",
    "finally , we end our analysis with a conclusion in sec . vi .",
    "we consider the top ti surface states with breaking trs , which is described by a massive dirac hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the wave vector and @xmath7 are pauli matrices describing electron spin .",
    "the first term in hamiltonian describes the gapless linear dispersion of the ti surface states . to break trs",
    ", we introduce a mass term @xmath8 as the second term in eq.(1 ) .",
    "the mass term can be generated by ferromagnetic coupling with an insulating magnetic material.@xcite in the following part , we only focus on the spps on the top ti surface .",
    "the optical properties of the surface state is determined by optical conductivity . for massive dirac hamiltonian , we consider both the longitudinal conductivity @xmath9 and hall conductivity @xmath10 in this system .",
    "we assume that the mass term @xmath11 and set the fermi level @xmath12 above the gap @xmath13 . utilizing @xmath14 as unit in the following equations , the optical conductivities are expressed by : @xcite    @xmath15     +    @xmath16    the first term in @xmath9 describes the drude weight for the intraband transitions . here",
    "we include a finite relaxation time @xmath17 which is experimentally determined by the surface states carrier mobility @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite then we get @xmath20 s for @xmath21 ev , where @xmath22 m / s is the fermi velocity .",
    "we use @xmath23 s in the following calculations .",
    "the second term is caused by interband transitions , when @xmath24 .",
    "hereafter , we focus on the low frequency case ( @xmath25 ) , and eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be simplified into @xmath26 . in homogenous tis , we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "when applying an electromagnetic wave on the gapped ti surface , the hall conductivity @xmath10 induces the magneto - optical kerr effect . to be specific ,",
    "the reflected waves from the surface of ti have different polarization from the incident waves .",
    "we define the fresnel reflection matrix @xmath29 as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the s - polarization and p - polarization respectively , and @xmath33 ( @xmath34,@xmath35=@xmath31,@xmath32 ) is the ratio of electric fields between the incident j - polarization wave and the reflected i - polarization wave .",
    "we consider the low frequency case ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath10 is a small quantity compared to @xmath9 .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath36 and @xmath37 are:@xcite    @xmath38    the off - diagonal elements @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be deduced by applying the standard boundary conditions .",
    "first we consider the incident s - polarization wave(fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , the boundary conditions are : @xmath41 by using eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we get the expression of @xmath39 : @xmath42    then we consider the p - polarization incident wave(fig .",
    "the boundary conditions are : @xmath43 thus,@xmath40 is solved as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the wave vector of free space light , @xmath46 is the in - plane wave vector , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the perpendicular wave vectors outside and inside the tis respectively , and @xmath49 is the permittivity of the bulk @xmath50.@xcite     of spps.(b)propagation length @xmath51 of spps .",
    "the red and green lines indicate the longitudinal type and transverse type spps respectively .",
    "we set fermi energy @xmath12=0.05ev.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +",
    "the pole of determinant of fresnel reflected coefficients gives the dispersion of spps .",
    "here we focus on the moderate frequency regime ( @xmath52 ) and derive the dispersion of spps for gapped ti surface states .",
    "normally , the s - polarization light can not produce spps .",
    "previous studies have shown that s - polarization light can lead to spp when retardation is included . however , this effect play a role in the low frequency regime ( @xmath53),@xcite where @xmath54 is the fine structure constant .",
    "this low frequency is beyond the parameter range of our calculation , thus we neglect the effects of retardation here .",
    "we find two types of spps : the p - polarization incident light leads to the longitudinal type , which is corresponding to poles of @xmath36 ( channel - i ) and @xmath40 ( channel - ii ) ; the s - polarization incident light leads to the transverse type , which is corresponding to poles of @xmath39 ( channel - iii ) .",
    "in particular , the longitudinal spps have two different response channels : the channel - i spp corresponds to the p - polarization reflection wave case , and the channel - ii spp corresponds to the s - polarization reflection wave case . besides , the transverse spp is charaterized by p - polarization reflection wave .",
    "the channel - ii and channel - iii spps are caused by magneto - optical kerr effect in trs broken tis surface states , while channel - i spp is the ordinary spp in common plasmonic materials .",
    "considering the electrostatic limit condition @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the plasmon wave vector , we deduce the dispersion for both two types of spps .",
    "the dispersion of the longitudinal spps is    @xmath57    we can use the drude formula of @xmath9 to reduce @xmath58 as    @xmath59    here , @xmath58 shows a quadratic dependence on the frequency @xmath60 .",
    "the real part of @xmath58 gives the wave length of longitudinal spps .",
    "the ratio of the wave lengths of the spps and free space light gives @xmath61(e_{f}/\\hbar\\omega)$ ] .",
    "the small ratio indicates the longitudinal spps exhibit tight confinement .",
    "considering the damping mechanism of spp due to ohmic losses of electrons , the spp have finite propagation distance @xmath62 , which is given by @xmath63 .",
    "the characteristic lengths of longitudinal spp stimulated by terahertz frequency photon are shown in fig.3 ( a)-(b ) .",
    "the difference between the channel - i and channel - ii spps can be observed when considering spp - emitter coupling strength , as shown in section v.    using the above method , we obtain the dispersion of the transverse spp : @xmath64 inserting drude formula of @xmath9 into eq .",
    "( 12 ) gives : @xmath65 the ratio of the wave length of transverse spp and free space light @xmath66(e_{f}/\\hbar\\omega)$ ] shows the degree of the spp confinement .",
    "similar to the longitudinal spp case , the propagation distance @xmath67 of transverse spp is determined by @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding characteristic lengths of transverse spp are shown in fig.3 ( a)-(b ) . in this paper , we focus on the moderate frequency regime ( @xmath52 ) , thus we neglect the effect of retardation on transverse spp .",
    "the transverse spp is a characteristic of the massive helical surface states .",
    "the spps can be experimentally measured by coupling polarized light to the surface of tis . in order to excite a spp",
    ", the frequency of the incident light must equal to the frequency of spp .",
    "however , the spp can not be directly excited by electromagnetic field due to the conservation of parallel momentum in homogenous materials .",
    "the problem can be overcome by special experiment techniques such as confined geometries@xcite or artificial periodic structure.@xcite the spps can be imaged by scanning near - field optical microscope in experiments .",
    "we consider an experimental realizable setup with a quantum dipole as an emitter close to a gapped ti surface states . the emitter energy can be transfered into the plasmon collective channels along the ti surface .",
    "the reflected electric field outside the ti can be enhanced due to the spps .",
    "we use the decay rate @xmath69 to describe degree of the coupling strength between the dipole emitter @xmath70 and electric field , which involves the dipole field and the scattered field @xmath71:@xcite",
    "@xmath72    where @xmath73 is the contribution of the dipole electric field .",
    "the second term corresponds to the energy dissipation related to the scattered electric field @xmath71 .",
    "the decay rate @xmath69 can be expressed in terms of the fresnel coefficients:@xcite    @xmath74    where @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the distance between the dipole emitter and the ti surface , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the parallel and perpendicular components of the dipole moment @xmath70 . in the electrostatic limit , the pole of different types of fresnel coefficients dominates the decay rate .",
    "thus , the integral can be easily estimated by analyzing the contribution of the spps related to the pole of fresnel coefficients .",
    "we calculate the decay rate of three spp channels , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath79 .    , respectively . in ( a )",
    ", ( b ) and ( c ) the dipole is placed 10 nm away from the ti surface .",
    "( d ) gives out the distance dependence of emitter - spp coupling .",
    "the fermi energy @xmath12 is 0.1 ev , and the photon energy @xmath60 is 0.03 ev .",
    "the decay rate @xmath80 is normalized to the the free - space value @xmath81 in all sub - figures .",
    "we set the gap energy @xmath82 mev , the dipole orientation @xmath83 , and dielectric constant @xmath84 in all cases.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    although the channel - i and channel - ii spps have the same dispersion , these two channels show different coupling strength with the emitter , as shown in fig.4 ( a)-(b ) .",
    "the channel - i spp decay rate is : @xmath85 as shown in fig.4 ( a ) , the decay rate is peaked at certain photon energy @xmath86 . from eq .",
    "( 11 ) , the photon energy @xmath60 determines the spp wave length @xmath87 .",
    "when @xmath88 , the decay rate is enhanced by @xmath89(\\lambda_{0}/\\lambda^{l}_{spp})^{3}$ ] orders of magnitude , where @xmath90 for dipole orientation @xmath83 . when @xmath91 , the spp decay rate @xmath92 exponentially decreases .",
    "as shown in fig.4 ( a ) , the decay rate @xmath92 decrease with enlarging @xmath60 , due to the tight confinement ( @xmath93 ) of spp for large @xmath60 .",
    "the decay rate of channel - ii spp is @xmath94 the decay rate of channel - ii spp is shown in fig.4(b ) .",
    "when @xmath88 , the decay rate is enhanced by @xmath95(\\lambda_{0}/\\lambda^{l}_{spp})^{3}$ ] orders of magnitude , where @xmath96 for dipole orientation @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath97 , the spp decay rate @xmath98 decreases exponentially . although the decay rate for channel - i and channel - ii spps share common dependence on the photon energy , these two cases are quantitatively different . comparing fig.4 ( a ) and fig.4 ( b ) , we conclude the former channel is one order of magnitude larger than the latter one .    the decay rate of channel - iii spp is @xmath99 the decay rate @xmath100 is enhanced by @xmath101(\\lambda_{0})^{3}/(\\lambda_{spp}^{t})^{5}$ ] orders of magnitude , where @xmath90 for dipole orientation @xmath83 . when @xmath102 , the spp decay rate @xmath100 exhibits an exponential damping , as shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) .    in all cases ,",
    "the spp decay rate is peaked at the order of @xmath103 for different channels in the terahertz frequency range . in addition , the decay rates rely on the distance between emitter and ti surface . as shown in fig .",
    "4(d ) , the decay rates decrease with enlarging the distance , characterized by a exponential behavior .",
    "our simulation show that when a dipole emitter is placed close to ti surface , the decay rate is greatly enhanced and the emission energy is converted into spps in ti surface .",
    "this makes ti surface state a good platform for strong light - matter interactions .",
    "in conclusion , we consider plasmonic properties of gapped ti surface and investigate the spps on a ti - vacuum interface .",
    "when trs is broken , the gapped ti surface states display magneto - optical kerr effect .",

    "there are three channels of spps , corresponding to poles of determinant of fresnel reflection matrix .",
    "the channel - i and channel - ii spp belong to longitudinal type , while the channel - iii spp is transverse type .",
    "furthermore , we derive the dispersions of spps and find that all three spp channels display tight confinement and relatively long propagation distances in terahertz frequency range . finally , we consider the light - matter interactions between spp channels and a dipole emitter .",
