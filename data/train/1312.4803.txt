    "extreme complexity of a phenomenon commonly termed as _ money _ stems from several factors .",
    "viewed in contemporary terms as a foreign exchange ( forex ) market it can be considered the world s largest and most important financial market , entirely decentralized , crossing all the countries , with the highest daily trading volume extending to trillions of us dollars .",
    "there is plenty of evidence @xcite that the forex s dynamics is more complex than that of any other market s .",
    "the absence of an independent reference frame makes the absolute currency pricing virtually impossible and a given currency s value is expressed by means of some other currency , which , in turn , is also denominated only in currencies .",
    "moreover , in global terms the forex market is exposed to current situation on other markets in all parts of the world , which makes it particularly sensitive and unpredictable .",
    "these facts together with other forex specific relationships like the triangle rule @xcite that links mutual exchange rates of three currencies are among the factors responsible for a highly convoluted structure @xcite of forex .",
    "complexity of money as a general medium of exchange that allows to avoid difficulties of barter trade requiring a `` double coincidence of needs '' and constitutes a measure of and a store of value , roots back even to its beginnings .",
    "menger @xcite proposed that money can spontaneously emerge in a commodity exchange economy .",
    "accordingly , each commodity is characterized by its own marketability reflecting its status in the market .",
    "money is a commodity , which through the process analogous to the physical spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite receives a very high marketability and thus a special status of a medium of exchange @xcite .",
    "katsuhito @xcite developed a model along the original menger s idea and demonstrated that money is governed by a kind of the so - called bootstrap mechanism , i.e. , it is accepted at any place at any time because it is in a position of money .",
    "agent based variants of such a model have further been studied by yasutomi @xcite and grski et al . @xcite who by numerical simulations demonstrated that they are able to reveal money emergence as well as its collapse . in general ,",
    "agent based models @xcite find an increasing number of promising applications in various areas of economics @xcite and in social sciences @xcite and the need for this kind of approaching the related phenomena , especially in an economic context , is being expressed more and more forcefully @xcite .",
    "for all these reasons in the present contribution , we further pursue simulations based on an agent based model which from an initial barter trading is able to spontaneously elevate one of the commodities to the money status .",
    "we in particular focus on the transition region between the homogenous commodities and emerging money phases with the aim to identify the complexity characteristics of this transition in terms of the multifractal scaling .",
    "below we list the main ingredients of the model used .",
    "in the model @xcite we have @xmath0 agents , each agent producing one type of good enumerated by @xmath1 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the agent number @xmath2 is producing a good type denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the elementary interaction of two agents ( `` transaction '' ) consist of several steps including search of the co - trader , exchange of particular goods , change of the agent s buying preferences and finally the production and consumption phase . a sequence of @xmath0 consecutive transactions",
    "is called a _",
    "turn_. in a single turn each of the @xmath0 agents has chance to take part in exchange of goods , production , and consumption .",
    "to each agent , say @xmath2 , there are attributed three @xmath0-dimensional vectors .",
    "the possession vector , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , with non - negative integer components that denote how many units of the @xmath5-th good has the @xmath2th agent at the moment .",
    "the demand vector , @xmath6 , is actually a `` shopping list '' , i.e. it counts how many goods of the type @xmath5 the agent @xmath2 is going to buy . finally , the `` world view '' vector , @xmath7 , with non - negative real components is related to the @xmath2th agent s shopping preferences .",
    "these preferences are evolving with time , depending on the preferences of the other agents ( co - traders ) as well as according to success of the previous transaction of the trader .",
    "the vector @xmath7 is normalized according to @xmath8 the higher is the value of @xmath7 , the more willing to buy the good @xmath5 is the agent @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , in each iteration for any @xmath2th agent there is a randomly attributed integer @xmath9 equal to the number @xmath10 pointing a good produced by the @xmath11th agent that the @xmath2th agent urgently needs at the moment .",
    "such a good is included in the shopping list independently of @xmath2th agent preferences ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the other goods at the shopping list will be added depending on the values of the `` world view '' ( preference ) vector . in particular ,",
    "if the value of a component @xmath5 of the vector @xmath12 is greater than the only external parameter of the model , @xmath13 $ ] , the good @xmath5 will be added to the shopping list .",
    "the model algorithm is defined by the following steps :    * step 1 . *",
    "an agent ( `` trader '' ) @xmath2 is chosen randomly .",
    "* step 2 . *",
    "the trader @xmath2 chooses a co - trader ( say , agent @xmath14 ) who has the largest amount of wanted good , @xmath9 .",
    "* step 3 . * both traders check what they have and what they want .",
    "* step 4 . *",
    "the traders exchange their views . at first",
    ", they increase the value of component @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) by @xmath17 if their previous demands were not satisfied , i.e.    @xmath18 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "then both traders accept an averaged view :    @xmath19/2 $ ] ( @xmath16 ) .    finally ,",
    "the new views are re - normalized according to the condition ( [ vnormalization ] ) .",
    "* step 5 . *",
    "the traders create their `` shopping list '' i.e. they decide what they want to buy . for the trader @xmath2 :    if @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 , otherwise @xmath23 .    the same is done symmetrically ( @xmath24 ) by the co - trader @xmath14 and for all types of goods , @xmath25 .",
    "* the exchange procedure .",
    "the traders `` buy '' ( exchange ) goods according to their shopping lists @xmath26 , @xmath16 , @xmath27 .",
    "if total amount of goods on both their shopping lists ( demands ) is identical , @xmath28 , then their demands are fully satisfied and the shopping lists are zeroed .",
    "if the shopping list of one trader ( say , @xmath2 ) is bigger then the shopping list of his co - trader , all demands of trader @xmath2 can not be satisfied .",
    "hence , after the exchange the vector @xmath29 will have non - zero components for the goods that could not be bought . in this case",
    "the trader with a larger shopping list ( @xmath2 ) can satisfy his demands partially only .",
    "in particular , he selects from his co - trader one unit of good @xmath11 with the smallest component @xmath29 ( i.e. the agent prefers to get more rare goods ) .",
    "this procedure is repeated unit by unit until the shopping list @xmath30 is zeroed .",
    "if one of the traders has empty shopping list ( all components are zero ) , there is no exchange at all and the whole transaction is finished without any exchange .",
    "notice , however , that in spite of this , the update of the world view vectors was already done ( step 5 ) . also during this step",
    ", the possession vectors @xmath31 of both traders are updated .",
    "* step 7 . *",
    "the final step consists of consumption and production .",
    "the traders @xmath32 consume goods specified by the variable @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "then , if @xmath34 , the traders produce one unit of the good @xmath35 . finally , we choose new wants for the traders : new values for the variables @xmath33 are randomly selected @xmath36 .",
    "this ends the elementary transaction process .",
    "the initial conditions are the following : @xmath37 , @xmath23 , @xmath38 , and @xmath9 are chosen randomly from the set @xmath39 for each @xmath2 . in particular , the initial shopping list is empty and the `` views '' of all traders are identical and equally distributed for all goods .    in the model money",
    "is defined as the good satisfying the following four conditions : ( i ) that is most wanted by all agents , i.e. @xmath40 is maximized ( @xmath41 ) for the value of @xmath11 that corresponds to the good that plays the role of money ; ( ii ) the total trade should be nonzero ; ( iii ) in comparison to other goods , money should be relatively often exchanged ; ( iv ) the money lifetime should be sufficiently long ( lasting for many trades ) .     and threshold @xmath42 .

    "note different scales.,width=472 ]    an example of time evolution of the principal characteristics of this model for the population size @xmath46 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the following dynamical variables : ( a ) @xmath43 , ( b ) production of goods , ( c ) supply of the most wanted good , and ( d ) points of the `` money switching '' , i.e. the points when the most wanted good is overtaken by another good .",
    "the distances between the consecutive time - points are thus to be interpreted as `` money lifetimes '' within the present model . these plots are given for the threshold value @xmath45 which for @xmath46 marks a center of the region where money start emerging .",
    "from the point of view of complexity science and in relation to the financial reality , this is the most interesting region .",
    "the structure of `` money lifetimes '' seen in panel ( d ) of fig .  [ fig1 ] suggests their fractal organization and thus critical character of the transition from the phase with no money to the money phase while increasing the parameter @xmath47 value .",
    "this is even more suggestive in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] showing the consecutive `` money lifetimes '' for @xmath48 and @xmath45 measured in terms of the number of trading turns .",
    "while in the former case we see a white noise - like structure with very short lifetimes , in the latter case the commodity fulfilling the criterion of money often happens to reign for up to 35000 trading turns .",
    "the overall structure in this latter case displays a characteristic volatility clustering , which is a hallmark of criticality and multiscaling @xcite . in the following",
    "we therefore perform a more systematic quantitative study of this particular aspect of the present model using the modern formalism of multifractality @xcite .",
    "multiscaling @xcite represents a commonly accepted concept to grasp the most essential characteristics of complexity . indeed , the related measure in terms of multifractal spectra offers an attractively compact frame to quantify the hierarchy of scales and specificity of their interwoven organization .",
    "this in particular applies to the temporal aspects of complexity and , thus , well suits the present issue of `` money switching '' dynamics . up to now",
    "there exist two main types of algorithms to determine the multifractal spectra .",
    "the one that typically delivers the most stable results @xcite constitutes a natural extension of detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite and is known as multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( mfdfa ) @xcite .",
    "the other algorithm - wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) @xcite - is based on the wavelet decomposition of a signal .",
    "this algorithm requires more care as far as stability of the result is concerned .",
    "it at the same time offers better visualization of the relevant structures , however . for this reason , and also as a consistency test , below we use both these algorithms in parallel to analyze the same time series .",
    "the mfdfa algorithm consists of several steps as sketched below . at first , for a time series @xmath49 a signal profile is calculated according to the equation : @xmath50\\ \\",

    "then the profile is divided into @xmath52 disjoint segments @xmath53 of length @xmath54 starting both from the beginning and from the end of the time series . for each box",
    "the assumed trend is estimated by least - squares fitting a polynomial @xmath55 of order @xmath56 . based on our own experience ( owicimka et al 2006 ) in the present analysis we use @xmath57 as optimal .",
    "next , variance of the detrended data is calculated : @xmath58 and finally , by averaging the @xmath59 function over all the segments @xmath53 , a @xmath60th - order fluctuation function is derived according to the equation : @xmath61^{q/2}\\rbrace^{1/q},\\ \\ q\\epsilon",

    "series , fluctuation funtion @xmath62 reveals power law dependence : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the generalized hurst exponent . for monofractal time series",
    ", @xmath64 is independent of @xmath60 and equals the well - known hurst exponent @xmath65 . in the case of multifractal correlations",
    ", however , @xmath64 depends on @xmath60 and the hurst exponent is obtained for @xmath66 . from @xmath64 exponents , one can calculate the multifractal spectrum according to the equations : @xmath67 + 1 $ ] , where @xmath68 denotes the hoelder exponent and @xmath69 is the fractal dimension of the set of points with this particular @xmath68 . for multifractal time series , the singularity spectrum typically assumes shape similar to an inverted parabola whose width is considered a measure of the degree of multifractality and it thus shrinks to one point in the case of monofractal .    by using this method , we then address the problem of correlations in the time series of money lifetimes . for this time series ( as the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) or in fig .  [ fig2 ] )",
    ", the scale @xmath54 dependence for the set of the so - evaluated fluctuation functions @xmath62 ( @xmath70 ) around the critical threshold value for the emergence of money , starting with @xmath48 up to @xmath71 with the step of 0.5 , is shown in fig .",
    "as it can clearly be seen , these functions develop a power law form over the scale range of about two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , the @xmath60-dependence of the corresponding power - law indices significantly varies with the threshold parameter @xmath47 and around @xmath45 this dependence ( here shown for @xmath70 ) is the most prominent , which signals nontrivial multifractality .",
    "the degree of multifractality systematically increases while approaching this @xmath47 value from below , but then it sharply degrades when exceeding it .",

    "[ fig3 ] and ( inset ) for the same but randomized ( shuffled ) time series of money lifetimes.,width=472 ]    the resulting singularity spectra @xmath69 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the same sequence of the parameter @xmath47 values as in fig .",
    "indeed , the broadest spectrum - reflecting the hightest complexity of the underlying dynamics @xcite - corresponds to @xmath45 and departing from this value in either direction makes @xmath69 narrower with the maximum moving towards @xmath74 like for the monofractal uncorrelated signals .",
    "comparison of these singularity spectra to the analogous quantities for the randomized ( shuffled ) data , shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , clearly demonstrates significance of this result .",
    "after such a destruction of temporal correlations , all the spectra become narrow and located in the vicinity of @xmath75 .",
    "this comparison thus indicates that multifractal nature of the time series representing consecutive money lifetimes is primarily due to the long - range temporal correlations .",
    "as already mentioned above , the wtmm method is an alternative technique of detecting the fractal properties of a signal .",
    "the core of the algorithm is wavelet transform @xmath76 that is a convolution of a signal @xmath77 and a wavelet @xmath78 @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes a shift of the wavelet kernel and @xmath54 is scale . in particular , the wavelet kernel @xmath78 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "the only criterion is its good localization in space and in frequency domains . for the purpose of our analysis",
    ", we choose the third derivative of the gaussian @xmath81 because it removes the trends that can be approximated by polynomials up to the second order . in the presence of singularity in the data , the scaling relation of @xmath76 coefficients",
    "can be observed : @xmath82 however , this relation can be unstable in the case of densely packed singularities . therefore , it is suggested to identify the local maxima of @xmath76 and then to calculate the partition function according to the equation : @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes a set of all maxima for scale @xmath54 and @xmath85 is the position of a particular maximum . in order to preserve the monotonicity of the family of the @xmath86 functions",
    ", the additional condition needs to be imposed : @xmath87 in the case of fractal signals , the @xmath88 exponents characterize the power - law behavior of the partition function : @xmath89 for multifractal time series @xmath88 is a nonlinear function of @xmath60 , whereas it is linear otherwise .",
    "the singularity spectrum is obtained by legendre transforming @xmath88 according to the following formula : @xmath90    two examples of the maps representing the wavelet transforms @xmath91 calculated from the same time series of money lifetimes as before for our model with @xmath48 and @xmath45 are shown in fig .",
    "the fractal character of these signals can be seen already on the visual level to manifest itself quite convincingly from the bifurcation structure of the maxima of the wavelet transform . for @xmath45 ( right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) the intensities of maxima vary with the scale , while for @xmath48 ( left hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) they remain largely homogenous , which signals a more involved fractal composition in the former case .",
    "of course , we already know from our previous mfdfa analysis that the @xmath45 case is strongly multifractal while the @xmath48 case is essentially monofractal , and here we find an alternative indication for this fact . determining the singularity spectra according to the above - described wtmm algorithm for the same six cases of the model s threshold parameter @xmath47 as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] gives the results shown in fig .",
    "comparing both mfdfa and wtmm results indicates basically the same tendency even on a fully quantitative level : the broadest singularity spectrum characterizes the dynamics at around the critical threshold value for the emergence of money .",
    "these comparisons are summarized globally in fig .",

    "we have performed extensive numerical simulations using the agent - based computational economic model for the creation of money , developed along the lines originally proposed by menger @xcite that money can spontaneously emerge in a commodity exchange economy .",
    "money in this model is defined as the most wanted good .",
    "a variant of this model studied in the present paper allows emergence as well as collapse of money .",
    "this model s ability is ruled by the only external parameter @xmath47 whose magnitude reflects agents tendency to act collectively and it induces memory effects .",
    "the most interesting situation takes place just at the edge between a phase with no money emergence and a phase with stable money . in this intermediate region one of the commodities",
    "spontaneously becomes universally wanted and retains such a status for sufficiently long time so that it can be considered money . under these edge conditions the dynamics of trade is characterized by a permanent competition which leads to collapse of that particular money and another commodity overtaking . an interesting related effect that we were witnessing at the course of simulations",
    "is that such overtaking often alternates within one particular pair of commodities . in contemporary terms",
    "this can perhaps be interpreted as this model s ability to induce effects in the spirit of competition of two currencies to become world s leading ( like usd versus euro ) . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the most interesting effect is that lifetimes of the consecutive money emerging within the model at the edge , form time series that develop remarkable multifractal characteristics as verified by the two independent algorithms : multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( mfdfa ) and wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) .",
    "the width of the corresponding singularity spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) considered as a function of the threshold parameter resembles the @xmath95-shaped continuous phase transitions in physical systems , recently identified even in the complex networks dynamics  @xcite . that this transition can be paralleled to the critical phenomena is primarily indicated by an increasing span of the multifractal spectrum ( and thus an increasing complexity ) when approaching the transition point .",
    "the ability of the present model to generate the above effects seems very demanding since the most creative acts of nature are commonly considered to be associated with criticality @xcite .",
    "there also exists empirical evidence @xcite that the consecutive intertransaction times on the stock market form time series that are multifractal .",
    "one may speculate that there is some analogy between the present `` money lifetime '' issue and the stock market intertransaction times : during a given `` lifetime '' money is the same ; similarly , price may change only during transaction . from this perspective intertransaction time",
    "can be considered `` price lifetime '' ."
