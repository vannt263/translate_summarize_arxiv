    "socio - economic problems have been the targets of several studies in last years @xcite .",
    "those interdisciplinary topics are usually treated by means of computer simulations of agent - based models , which allow us to understand the emergence of collective phenomena in those systems . among the studied problems ,",
    "one of great interest is tax evasion dynamics , which is interesting from the practical point of view because tax evasion remains to be a major predicament facing governments @xcite .",
    "economists studied models of tax evasion during several years @xcite , and more recently physicists also became interested in the subject @xcite ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) . experimental evidence provided by gachter",
    "suggests that tax payers tend to condition their decision regarding whether to pay taxes or not on the tax evasion decision of the members of their group @xcite .",
    "in addition , frey and torgler also provide empirical evidence on the relevance of conditional cooperation for tax morale @xcite .",
    "taking those discussions into account , zaklan _ et al .",
    "_ recently proposed a model that has been attracted attention @xcite . in the so - called zaklan model , the dynamics of tax payers and tax evaders",
    "is analyzed by means of the two - dimensional ising model at a given temperature @xmath0 .",
    "each agent @xmath1 in the artificial population may be in one of two possible states , namely @xmath2 ( honest ) or @xmath3 ( cheater or tax evader ) .",
    "a transition @xmath4 ( or a spin flip ) is controlled by the `` social temperature '' @xmath0 and also depends on the nearest neighbors states of the agent ( or spin ) at site @xmath1 .",
    "thus , for low temperatures few spin flips occur and for high temperatures many spin flips occur . in other words ,",
    "tax evaders have the greatest influence to turn honest citizens into tax evaders if they constitute a majority in the respective neighborhood . in addition , some punishment rules are applied : there is a probability @xmath5 of an audit each agent is subject to in every period and a length of time @xmath6 detected tax evaders remain honest @xcite . in another work , the dynamics of the model",
    "was also controlled by another two - state model , namely the majority - vote model with noise @xcite , where the noise @xmath7 plays the role of the temperature . in this case ,",
    "similar results were found @xcite , suggesting that the results of the zaklan model are robust .",
    "an interesting extension of such models is to consider that the transition from honest to evader is not abrupt . in this case , it can be considered a third state that can be called susceptible of undecided @xcite .",
    "the presence of such class was analyzed taking into account the dynamics of kinetic exchange opinion models @xcite , and considering the same punishment rules of the zaklan model . in this case , it was discussed @xcite that the presence of such third class affects substantially the dynamics , and that the compliance is high below the critical point ( of the order - disorder transition ) of the opinion dynamics governed by the kinetic exchanges . on the other hand , above the critical point the tax evasion can be considerably reduced by the enforcement mechanism .    in this work we propose another three - state agent - based model to analyze tax evasion dynamics .",
    "the transitions among the classes are ruled by probabilities , similarly to what happens in models of epidemic spreading @xcite .",
    "the enforcement mechanism is considering in the mentioned probabilities , as well as the social pressure of the contacts of a given individual .",
    "we will also see that the emergence of tax evaders in the population can be associated with a nonequilibrium phase transition , that was not observed in previous physics models of tax evasion , to the best of our knowledge @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the model s rules and the individuals presented in the population .",
    "after , we discuss results in three distinct topologies .",
    "finally , in section 3 we present our conclusions and final remarks .",
    "we considered a population of @xmath8 agents defined in a given network of contacts , that will be defined specifically in the following .",
    "each individual @xmath1 ( @xmath9 ) can be in one of three possible states or attitudes at a given time step @xmath10 , represented by @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , @xmath14 represents the number of individuals in a given state , with @xmath15 .",
    "the state @xmath16 represents a _ honest tax payer _ ,",
    "i.e. , an individual 100@xmath17 convinced of his / her honesty , who does not consider evasion .",
    "he / she is either habitually compliant or he / she is a recent evader who has become honest as a result of enforcement efforts or social norms . on the other hand ,",
    "the state @xmath18 represents a cheater , i.e , an individual who is an _ evading tax payer_. whether a tax payer continues to evade depends on both enforcement and the effect of social interactions . finally , the third state @xmath19 consists of taxpayers who are dissatisfied with the tax system ( perhaps as a result of seeing others evade without being punished ) .",
    "these taxpayers are not actively evading , but they might if the perceived benefits of doing so exceed the perceived costs .",
    "for this group , evasion is an option , and so we classify them as _ susceptibles _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , they are susceptible to become evaders .",
    "we consider here two distinct mechanisms to govern the transitions among the above - mentioned classes @xmath20 and @xmath18 : social interactions and enforcement regime .",
    "the possible transitions are as follows : @xmath21    the interpretation of these transitions is as follows .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) represents an encounter of a honest agent @xmath16 with an evader @xmath18 . in this case , with probability @xmath22 the honest individual becomes susceptible @xmath19 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 can be viewed as the persuasion power of the evaders .",
    "the following transition , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) represents a spontaneous transition from the susceptible state @xmath19 to the evader state @xmath18 .",
    "the enforcement affects the behavior of a susceptible individual through its effect on the perceived costs of evasion ( cost - benefit analysis ) .",
    "thus , we assume that some susceptible tax payers will perceive that the benefits of evasion exceed the costs of evasion in each period , leading these individuals to evade .",
    "this is represented by the probability @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", we consider that the transition from honest to evader is not abrupt : the individual first becomes susceptible and after he might become evader .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) represents the opposite transition in comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", it represents an encounter of an evader agent @xmath18 with a honest tax payer @xmath16 . in this case , with probability @xmath24 the evader individual becomes honest .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 can be viewed as the persuasion power of the honests .",
    "one can also consider that this last transition occurs to the state @xmath19 , but for simplicity we consider that the evaders go directly to the honest compartment .",
    "finnaly , eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) represents another enforcement effect .",
    "we consider that evaders become compliant after they are audited or when their perceptions regarding the costs and benefits of evasion change , either through experience or changing economic conditions @xcite .",
    "this transition occurs with probability @xmath25 , that can be viewed as a measure of the efficiency of the government s fiscalization .",
    "as in the previous case , one can also consider that some evaders might not be rehabilitated when they are audited , remaining susceptible rather than becoming honest , but for simplicity we will not consider those additional transitions .    in the following subsections we consider the model defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) - ( [ eq4 ] ) on the top of three distinct topologies : fully - connected network , erds - rnyi random graph and scale - free barabsi - albert network .",
    "in this section we consider the model on a fully - connected graph . considering the densities of each state ,",
    "namely @xmath26 ( @xmath15 ) , the above eqs . ( [ eq1 ] ) - ( [ eq4 ] ) can be translated on the mean - field equations @xmath27 where now @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the fractions of honest , susceptible and tax evader individuals , respectively",
    ".    one can start analyzing the time evolution of the three classes of individuals .",
    "we numerically integrated eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) in order to analyze the effects of the variation of the model s parameters . as initial conditions",

    "[ fig1 ] we exhibit results for fixed @xmath36 and typical values of @xmath22 ( left panels ) and for fixed @xmath37 and typical values of @xmath25 ( right panels ) . for the cases with fixed @xmath25",
    ", one can see that the increase of @xmath22 causes the decrease of @xmath28 and the increase of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "remembering that @xmath22 models the persuasion of evaders @xmath30 in the social interactions with honests @xmath28 , i.e. the transition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , it is easier to understand those results : for increasing values of @xmath22 more agents goes from the class @xmath28 to the class @xmath29 , and these susceptible individuals after can go to the evader class @xmath30 , which cause an increse of the susceptible and evader classes , and the decrease of honests .    on the other hand , in the graphics with fixed @xmath22 , one can see that the increase of @xmath25 leads to an increase of honests and a decrease of susceptibles and evaders .",
    "this is compatible with the interpretation of @xmath25 as a government fiscalization : the increase of the efficiency of the enforcement regime leads to the rise of honesty in the population , as well as the decrease of tax evasion .",
    "thus , the variation of those two parameters @xmath25 and @xmath22 models the competition of pressure of the social contacts and the state s fiscalization .    ,",

    "in this work , we have studied the dynamics of tax evasion through an epidemic - like model .",
    "we considered three compartments , namely honest tax payers , tax evaders and susceptibles , individuals that are in a intermediate class among honests and dishonests .",
    "the transitions among these classes are ruled by four distinct probabilities , that represent social interactions and the enforcement regime .",
    "we study the dynamics of the system on the top of three distinct topologies : fully - connected graph , erds - rnyi random graph and barabsi - albert scale - free network .    for the fully - connected graph , one derive mean - field equations that allow us to analyze in details the dynamics and the steady - state properties of the model .",
    "some realistic behaviors were observed , as the reduction of the evasion due to enforcement regime , as well as the increse of honesty .",
    "we also observed that the emergence of evaders in the population is associated with a nonequilibrium phase transition : for small values of the control parameter there are only honest tax payers in the population , and above the critical point the three classes ( honests , susceptibles and evaders ) coexist in the system .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar for the other topologies , but regarding the stationary values of the densities of individuals , we verified that the control of tax evasion is harder if the model is simulated on the top of complex networks . in this case",
    ", we also verified that the effect of social pressure is more pronounced in comparison with the mean - field case .",
    "we observed that in the mean - field case the tax evasion ( fraction of noncompliant agents ) is absent ( @xmath51 ) even for high social pressure ( high @xmath22 ) , which can be seen as a limitation of the model in the simple case of a fully - connected topology .",
    "however , this unrealistic feature disappears when we considered the model on the top of complex networks .",
    "indeed , for the er random graph the region where the tax evaders disappear of the population in the steady states is given by a narrow range of values of @xmath22 , even if the government s fiscalization is high .",
    "on the other hand , in the ba scale - free network this effect is more pronounced , and for sufficient large networks the evasion is always present in the population , even for strong fiscalization .    some qualitative comparison with real data can be done .",
    "some authors estimated the tax evasion in brazil in the range @xmath71 , or even higher values ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this range of evasion can be verified in our results for small values of @xmath25 , i.e. , for weak fiscalization and/or light punishment , as occurs in brazil @xcite .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the fraction of evasion in the range @xmath71 can be observed for @xmath62 , considering the range @xmath72 ( mean field ) . for the networks ,",
    "one can see the mentioned range of evasion for @xmath73 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath74 ( @xmath63 ) , for the er network ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . for the ba network , @xmath75 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath76 ( @xmath63 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the phase transition observed in the mean - field formulation of the model is an active - absorbing phase transition , and the predicted exponent for the order parameter is @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) as in the mean - field directed percolation , that is the prototype of a phase transition to an absorbing state @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to estimate numerically other critical exponents of the model , as well as to simulate it in regular d - dimensional lattices ( square , cubic , for example ) in order to obtain all the critical exponents .",
    "this is important to define precisely the universality class of the model , as well as its upper critical dimension .",
    "this extension is left for a future work .",
    "furthermore , it can also be considered the inclusion of heterogeneities in the population , like agents conviction , mass media effects , etc .",
