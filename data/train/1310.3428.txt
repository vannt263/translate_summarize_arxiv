    "by colliding heavy ions at high energies one hopes to heat and/or compress the matter to energy densities at which the production of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) begins  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculations can study this non - perturbative regime of qcd  @xcite and allow a quantitative investigation of the qgp properties . a first order phase boundary is expected to separate high temperature hadron matter from the qgp for large net baryon density and is believed to end in a critical point  @xcite . a wealth of ideas have been proposed to explore the properties and the phase structure of strongly interacting matter .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations of various observables may be sensitive to the transitions between hadronic and partonic phases  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the location of the critical point may be signalled by a characteristic pattern in the energy and system size dependence of the measured fluctuation signals .",
    "pb+pb reactions were investigated at the cern sps since 1994 by a variety of experiments at the top sps energy .",
    "many of the predicted signals of the qgp were observed  @xcite , but their uniqueness was in doubt .",
    "motivated by predictions of the statistical model for the early stage of nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite of characteristic changes of hadron production properties at the onset of qgp creation ( onset of the deconfinement ) the na49 experiment performed a scan of the entire sps energy range , from 158__a _ _ down to 20__a _ _ gev .",
    "the predicted features were found at an energy of about 30__a _ _ gev in central pb+pb collisions  @xcite , thereby indicating the onset of deconfinement in collisions of heavy nuclei in the sps beam energy range .",
    "these observations have recently been confirmed by the rhic beam energy scan and the expected trend towards higher energy is consistent with lhc data  @xcite .    motivated by these findings",
    "the na49 collaboration has started to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter , with the aim of searching for indications of the first order phase transition and the critical point by studying several measures of fluctuations .",
    "in particular , the energy dependence of dynamical event - by - event fluctuations of the particle composition was investigated using the measure @xmath3(a / b ) with a and b denoting the multiplicities of different particle species .",
    "an increasing trend of @xmath3 for both k / p and k/@xmath0 ratios towards lower collision energies was observed  @xcite . in contrast , recent results of the star experiment from the beam energy scan ( bes ) at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) show practically no energy dependence of the related event - by - event fluctuation measure @xmath2  @xcite for [ k , p ] and [ k , @xmath0 ] pairs  @xcite .",
    "the comparison between na49 and corresponding star results was performed using the relation    @xmath5    however , the accuracy of this relation decreases inversely with multiplicity , i.e. at lower energies this relation is only approximate . in order not to rely on this approximation the fluctuation measure @xmath2",
    "was directly reconstructed in this paper using a novel identification scheme , the _ identity method _",
    "the procedure avoids event - by - event particle ratio fits and the use of mixed events necessary to subtract the artificial correlations introduced by the fits .",
    "moreover , the much improved statistical power allows to study the effects of the different phase space coverage of the na49 ( forward rapidities ) and star ( central rapidity , without low-@xmath6 range ) experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "details about the detector setup and the data are given in section  [ secdata ] .",
    "section  [ sec - cuts ] discusses the event and track selection criteria .",
    "the novel features of this analysis , i.e. the particle identification procedure and the extraction of the moments of the multiplicity distributions , are discussed in sections  [ sec - pid ] and  [ sec - identity ] , respectively .",
    "section  [ sec - errors ] presents the estimates of statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "results on @xmath2 and their phase - space dependence are discussed in sections  [ sec - nu ] and  [ sec - accepatance ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec - summary ] summarizes the paper .",
    "this paper presents results for central pb+pb collisions at projectile energies of 20__a _ _ , 30__a _ _ , 40__a _ _ , 80__a _ _ and 158__a _ _ gev , recorded by the na49 experiment ( for a detailed description of the na49 apparatus cf .",
    "the principal tracking detectors are four large volume time projection chambers ( tpc ) with two of them , vertex tpcs ( vtpc1 and vtpc2 ) , placed inside superconducting dipole magnets with a combined maximum bending power of 9 tm for a length of 7 m. care was taken to keep the detector acceptance approximately constant with respect to midrapidity by setting the magnetic field strength proportional to the beam energy .",
    "particle identification in this analysis is achieved by simultaneous measurement of particle momenta and their specific energy loss _",
    "de / dx _ in the gas volume of the main tpcs ( mtpc - l and mtpc - r ) .",
    "these are located downstream of the magnets on either side of the beam , have large dimensions ( 4 m @xmath7 4 m @xmath7 1.2 m ) and feature 90 readout pad rows , providing an energy loss measurement with a resolution of about 4@xmath8 . in the experiment pb beams with an intensity of 10@xmath9 ions / s were incident on a thin lead foil located 80 cm upstream of the vtpc-1 .",
    "for 20__a _ _ - 80__a _ _  gev and 158__a _ _  gev the target thicknesses amounted to 0.224 g/@xmath10 and 0.336 g/@xmath10 , correspondingly .",
    "the centrality of a collision was determined based on the energy of projectile spectators measured in the veto calorimeter ( vcal ) which is located 26 m behind the target and covers the projectile - spectator phase space region .",
    "a collimator in front of the calorimeter was adjusted for each energy in such a way that all projectile spectator protons , neutrons and beam fragments could reach the veto calorimeter while keeping the number of produced particles hitting the calorimeter as small as possible .    [",

    "the dependence of @xmath2 on the selected phase space region was studied by performing the analysis in different phase space bins stretching from a forward rapidity cut to mid - rapidity .",
    "technically different phase space bins were selected by applying upper momentum cuts to the reconstructed tracks where the cut value corresponded to the momentum of a proton at @xmath6=0 with a chosen maximum rapidity .",
    "thereafter this quantity will be called a proton rapidity cut .",

    "interestingly the acceptance dependence weakens above 30__a _ _  gev where no difference was observed with star .",
    "it is also remarkable that @xmath29 $ ] shows little dependence on the covered phase space region .",
    "this detailed study of @xmath2 in different phase space regions appears to explain to a large extent the difference between the star bes and na49 measurements .",
    "some final remarks are in order concerning the properties and the significance of the fluctuation measure @xmath2 . to reveal the physics underlying",
    "the studied event - by - event fluctuations , the fluctuation signals measured in heavy - ion ( a+a ) collisions should be compared systematically to a reference from nucleon - nucleon ( n+n ) collisions at corresponding energies per nucleon .",
    "it is however important to properly take into account trivial differences between a+a and n+n collisions e.g. in the size of the colliding systems . an additional complication in the experimental study of fluctuations in a+a collisions",
    "are unavoidable volume fluctuations from event to event .",
    "to take account of these considerations a set of `` strongly intensive '' fluctuation measures has been proposed in ref .",
    "in fact , the scaled @xmath2 ( see eq.([nuscaling ] ) ) is related to the strongly intensive measure @xmath30 ( cf .",
    "eq.(13 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath12^{scaled } \\equiv \\frac{\\nu_{\\text{dyn}}[a , b]}{\\frac{1}{\\langle a \\rangle}+\\frac{1}{\\langle b \\rangle } } = \\sigma^{ab } -1 .",
    "\\label{sigmadef}\\ ] ]    future studies of strongly intensive measures may lead to a better understanding of the underlying source of correlations .",
    "in summary several scenarios were investigated to understand the differences between the na49 and star measurements of the excitation functions of @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] . for this purpose",
    "the particle identification procedure formerly employed by na49 was replaced by a different approach , the _ identity method _ , to reconstruct the fluctuation measure @xmath2 .",
    "the increasing trend of @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] towards lower energies reported in previous publications of na49 in terms of the quantity @xmath3 was confirmed by this analysis .",
    "a detailed study of @xmath2 reveals a strong dependence on the phase space coverage at low energies for @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] which might explain the different energy dependences measured by na49 ( central pb+pb collisions ) and star ( bes program for central au+au collisions ) . as an outlook it is worth mentioning that since the _ identity method _ reconstructs first and second moments of the multiplicity distributions of identified particles one will be able to investigate the energy dependence of all the fluctuation measures proposed in ref .",
    "these quantities are better suited for phase transition studies because ( within the grand canonical ensemble ) they depend neither on the volume nor on its fluctuations which can not be tightly controlled in experiments .",
