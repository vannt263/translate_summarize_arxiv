    "cold atom physics faces a crisis .",
    "experimentalists are trying to produce ever - more complicated states of matter which are intrinsically difficult to cool @xcite . to further complicate matters , the techniques used to produce these states add mechanisms for heating .",
    "one paradigm for addressing this crisis is to divide the system into two parts : a  reservoir \" which can readily be cooled , coupled to a smaller subsystem which has interesting properties @xcite .",
    "the prototypical example of such a separation are the  dimple traps \" pioneered by pinkse _",
    "@xcite , and more recently explored by several other groups @xcite .",
    "the key to such programs is an understanding of the kinetic processes through which energy and particles move between the two subsystems .",
    "here we model the loading and equilibration of a dimple trap in a gas of weakly interacting bosons .",
    "the initial dimple experiments were motivated by a desire to reduce the complexity of cooling atomic gases , and explore fundamental questions of condensate growth @xcite .",
    "dimples have been key to proposals to study atom lasers @xcite .",
    "they also have promising applications in atom interferometry @xcite , quantum tweezers for atoms @xcite , controlling soliton - sound interaction @xcite , ultraslow light propagation @xcite , and studying analogs of cosmological physics @xcite .",
    "stellmer _ et al . _ describes a typical dimple experiment in ref .",
    "they precool a cloud of bosonic atoms to hundreds of nanokelvin , and trap them in a large but shallow optical trap . at this point , the phase space density is well below the threshold for condensation .",
    "next a laser beam focused in a small region near the trap center creates a strongly attractive dimple potential , causing a great increase in the local atom density without much change in temperature .",
    "as the density in the dimple grows , they see the development of a condensate .",
    "theoretical steps have been taken to understand the kinetics of bose condensation by this method @xcite . however",
    ", a detailed quantitative study of how the condensate fraction , the temperature , and the characteristic time scales depend on the trap parameters and the initial conditions is , to our knowledge , still lacking .",
    "here we take a simple quantum kinetic approach towards achieving this goal .    since in experiments like stellmer _ et al .",
    "_ s , the phase space density in the reservoir stays small , we model it as a classical boltzmann gas in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) harmonic well .",
    "we assume that the collision rate in the reservoir is fast compared to the condensation dynamics so that the reservoir is always in quasi - thermal equilibrium : the occupation of a mode of energy @xmath0 is @xmath1 , where the temperature @xmath2 and the chemical potential @xmath3 depend on time .",
    "many cold atom experiments are described by such a quasi - equilibrium @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the harmonic well is isotropic .",
    "we model the dimple as a 3d square well , and consider the case where it is turned on suddenly at @xmath4 .",
    "this is a prototypical protocol for turning on the dimple @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ parameters ] , we outline the physical parameters relevant to the dynamics . in sec . [ kinetics model ] , we analyze the two - body scattering processes responsible for the transfer of atoms from the reservoir to the dimple and their redistribution among the momentum states of the dimple .",
    "in particular , the dimple is populated via two - body collisions : one particle enters the dimple , transferring energy to the second .",
    "this permits us to write down rate equations for the populations of the dimple states . due to the symmetry of kinetic processes ,",
    "the population of a dimple state depends only on its energy . since in most present - day experiments",
    "the dimple contains thousands of energy levels @xcite , we describe their populations by a continuous distribution function @xmath5 , treating the ground state occupation ( @xmath6 ) separately . as the collision processes also change the number of atoms ( @xmath7 ) and the energy ( @xmath8 ) in the reservoir , we arrive at coupled rate equations for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .    in sec .",
    "[ thermalization section ] , we discuss the short - time dynamics after turning on the dimple .",
    "we find that energy levels near half the dimple depth start filling up first .",
    "when the atom density in the dimple becomes comparable to that in the reservoir , particle scattering between energy levels initiates thermalization . denoting",
    "the collisional mean free time in the reservoir by @xmath9 , we find that for @xmath10 , @xmath5 is well approximated by a thermal distribution .",
    "the states in the high - energy tail take longer to thermalize than those near the bottom of the dimple .",
    "similar thermalization time scales were reported in previous studies in a wide range of geometries @xcite . during thermalization , for large enough dimple depths",
    ", we notice that @xmath5 passes through a bimodal shape , which should show up in time - of - flight images in experiments .",
    "we find that @xmath11 grows slowly at first until it becomes sufficiently large that bose stimulation takes over .",
    "this gives rise to an onset time @xmath12 after which the condensate grows rapidly .",
    "this effect was studied for condensation by evaporative cooling in harmonic traps @xcite , and has been observed in recent experiments on dimples @xcite .",
    "we consider both the cases of an infinite trap depth and a finite trap depth . in the former situation",
    "we allow particles in the reservoir to have arbitrarily high energies , whereas in the latter , we eject particles which recoil from a collision with an energy greater than the trap depth . in sec .",
    "[ infinite trap depth ] , we discuss the infinite trap depth case . in practice , this is equivalent to a trap whose depth is large compared to the dimple depth and the initial thermal energy .",
    "the reservoir temperature rises as particles are scattered into the dimple . in the absence of inelastic losses , the dimple population grows monotonically , saturating after a time @xmath13 at a value limited by the amount of heating .",
    "guided by the result that the dimple thermalizes fast compared to the population growth rates , we introduce a simplified model where we assume that @xmath5 is given by a thermal bose - einstein distribution .",
    "this method reproduces all features of the full model for @xmath14 , and requires fewer computational resources to simulate .",
    "we only use this approximation in sec .",
    "[ infinite trap depth ] , returning to the full kinetic equations in later sections .",
    "we provide detailed results of how the final populations , the final temperature , the entropy gain , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 vary with the dimple depth @xmath15 , the initial phase space density @xmath16 , and the ratio of the reservoir volume to the dimple volume @xmath17 , and the initial temperature @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , the atoms do not condense if @xmath15 is smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "as @xmath15 is increased , the final condensate fraction @xmath20 grows and attains a maximum for an optimal depth @xmath21 which is set by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . with further increase in @xmath15",
    ", @xmath20 falls off due to increased heating .",
    "such a non - monotonic variation was observed in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "in addition to maximizing @xmath20 , @xmath22 also minimizes @xmath12 .",
    "both @xmath20 and @xmath21 increase with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we find that @xmath23 sets the typical timescale for saturation .",
    "the dynamics become more non - adiabatic and takes longer to saturate at larger dimple depths .",
    "we add inelastic losses to our model in sec .",
    "[ threebody ] . here",
    "we consider the case for @xmath24rb where three - body recombination dominates the loss @xcite . in this process",
    "three atoms collide to produce a molecule in an excited state , thereby releasing a large amount of energy which causes all three atoms to escape . as a result",
    ", the condensate fraction decays toward zero after reaching a peak value @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "thus three - body loss gives a finite condensate lifetime @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath25 exhibits a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath15 similar to @xmath20 .",
    "however , the maximum condensate fraction is smaller by almost an order of magnitude due to the large three - body loss rate in the dimple where the density becomes large .",
    "we find that three - body loss also lowers the optimal dimple depth , in agreement with recent findings @xcite .",
    "smaller dimples result in higher local densities , which increase the loss rate .",
    "we therefore find an optimal volume ratio @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , there is an optimal initial phase space density @xmath29 .",
    "the three - body rate grows faster with @xmath18 than the two - body collision rate .",
    "thus @xmath25 falls off with @xmath18 .",
    "we find that @xmath27 increases with @xmath17 , and decreases with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath18 .",
    "since the three - body loss rate varies with the s - wave scattering length @xmath30 as @xmath31 @xcite , one can influence it by using a different species of atoms or exploiting feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "however , such manipulations may introduce other inelastic channels , and one should be careful to take that into account .    in sec .",
    "[ finite trap depth ] , we discuss how our results change when the reservoir trap has a finite depth @xmath32 . here",
    "we eject any atom which gains sufficient energy from a collision to have a total energy @xmath33 .",
    "such a model correctly describes a trapped gas in the knudsen regime : the collisional mean free path is larger than the size of the reservoir , which is true in most experiments on trapped gases @xcite .",
    "we assume that the atom energies in the reservoir follow a boltzmann distribution truncated at @xmath34 .",
    "previous numerical studies have shown that this assumption accurately describes evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "the effect of finite trap depth on the dynamics becomes appreciable when @xmath32 is no longer larger than @xmath15 and @xmath35 .",
    "we find that lower trap depths yield lower final temperatures , and increase the condensate growth rate .",
    "this leads to a higher condensate fraction @xmath25 and a longer lifetime @xmath27 .",
    "however , when @xmath32 becomes very small , the increased evaporation rate of the reservoir limits the rise of @xmath27 .",
    "we summarize our findings and suggest future work in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .    to keep the problem computationally tractable ,",
    "we have made some simplifying approximations .",
    "first , we have not included the mean - field interactions between the condensate and the thermal cloud @xcite .",
    "this mean - field changes the effective potential experienced by the atoms by an amount proportional to the condensate density , in effect changing the dimple depth .",
    "this causes a repulsion between the condensate and thermal cloud @xcite , and also lowers the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "it can be compensated by making the dimple parameters time - dependent , and is unimportant for the short - time dynamics .",
    "we do not model quantum fluctuations of the condensate @xcite , although our model does include thermal fluctuations .",
    "the modifications due to quantum fluctuations should be much smaller than that of the mean - field @xcite .",
    "we use the infinite square well energy eigenstates for the dimple .",
    "the kinetics do not depend on the exact model of the dimple potential as long as it contains many energy levels , which is true for present - day experiments @xcite . in modeling the condensation kinetics , we neglect two kinds of elastic collisions : first , we neglect collisions internal to the dimple where there is no exchange of atoms with the reservoir .",
    "these processes serve to equilibrate the dimple . within our approximations , we find that the dimple thermalizes within @xmath36 , and these processes can at most speed up thermalization . for @xmath37 ,",
    "these neglected collisions play no role .",
    "second , we neglect collisions in which an atom from a low - energy state in the dimple and an atom from the reservoir collide , leaving two atoms in the dimple .",
    "such collisions can become important for deep dimples when the condensate fraction becomes appreciable , and can subsequently enhance the dimple population rate .",
    "they can be included in a future refinement of our model , and might alter some quantitative details such as the time to reach saturation .",
    "however , we do not expect them to change any of the qualitative features our model captures @xcite .",
    "in this subsection we describe our model for the reservoir and the dimple , and develop some useful notation .",
    "we model the reservoir as an isotropic harmonic well of frequency @xmath38 , truncated at the trap depth @xmath32 , and assume a truncated boltzmann distribution .",
    "we can relate the number of atoms @xmath7 and the energy @xmath8 in the reservoir to @xmath32 , the inverse temperature @xmath39 , and the fugacity @xmath40 by integrating over phase space : @xmath41 .",

    "after the dimple is turned on , we consider the two different kinds of two - body elastic collisions which dominate the energy and particle transport between the reservoir and the dimple .",
    "these are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ processes ] . in the first kind , a collision between two atoms in the reservoir transfers one of the atoms to the dimple , while the other atom gains energy .",
    "the second atom can leave the reservoir if its total energy exceeds the trap depth @xmath32 . however , when @xmath32 is large compared to @xmath15 , it is more likely that the second atom will stay in the reservoir and cause heating .",

    "the first atom can then either remain in the reservoir or leave , depending on the amount of energy it gains or loses in the process .",
    "collisions of this second kind serve to thermalize the dimple by redistributing its atom population among the various energy levels . in the following ,",
    "we analyze these two kinds of collisions ( and their reverse processes ) in detail to derive the equations of motion for the dynamics .      here",
    "we consider the process shown in fig [ processes](a ) .",
    "two reservoir atoms with momenta @xmath97 and @xmath98 collide with each other .",
    "one of the atoms enters the @xmath89-th state in the dimple , and the other atom recoils with momentum @xmath99 .",

    "( ii ) due to the quantum - mechanical symmetry of identical bosons , the likelihood of scattering into the @xmath89-th state is enhanced by a factor of @xmath101 , the number of bosons already present in the @xmath89-th state .",

    "( iii ) the rate is proportional to @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the scattering amplitude for weakly interacting bosons , @xmath30 being the s - wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "this factor originates from the overlap of initial and final states in fermi s golden rule .",
    "since all four single - particle states involved in the collision have definite momenta , the overlap also produces a delta function which imposes conservation of momentum .",
