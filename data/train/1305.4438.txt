    "one of the most intriguing discovery of modern cosmology is the acceleration of the universe @xcite . a standard approach is to assume that dark energy of repulsive nature is causing the current acceleration .",
    "many candidates of the dark energy have been proposed @xcite , among which the cosmological constant is the most accepted one . along with yet another unidentified constituent of the universe called dark matter ,",
    "they compose standard cosmological model , @xmath1cdm @xcite . even though the extreme fine - tuning of the cosmological constant @xcite has been an unsatisfactory theoretical feature of the model , and many alternatives to explain the smallness of the cosmological constant as the source of dark energy",
    "have been proposed , it is remarkable that so far the observable universe can be well addressed with the @xmath1cdm model .    in this paper , we investigate cosmology of massive spinor electrodynamics with torsion .",
    "the theory consists of massive vector field interacting with the dirac spinor in the einstein - cartan space - time , and we find that both of these fields and torsion contribute to the energy densities of dark energy and pressureless dark matter at late times .",
    "spinor electrodynamics in curved space - time is an old subject and there are extensive amounts of literature on the subject , describing both classical and quantum aspect @xcite .",
    "but as far as cosmology is concerned , vector sector and spinor sector were considered separately so far .",
    "on the spinor side , it has been known for some time that spinor fields could play some important roles in the evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that a spinor field can accommodate any desired behavior of its energy density if an appropriate self - interaction of the spinor field is introduced .",
    "for the dirac spinor mass term , the energy density shows a cosmological behavior exactly like a pressureless dark matter term . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is investigated whether fermionic sources could be responsible for accelerated periods during the evolution of a universe after a matter field would guide for the decelerated period . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have shown that it is possible to simulate perfect fluid and dark energy by means of a nonlinear spinor field .",
    "on the other hand , the cosmology with vector fields received more attention recently and various models have been proposed to account for dark energy @xcite .",
    "nonlinear electromagnetism in cosmology was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the addition of a non - linear term to the lagrangian of the electromagnetic field yields a fluid with an asymptotically super - negative equation of state , causing an accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "universe filled with a massive vector field non - minimally coupled to gravitation was proposed , and the cosmology yields a dark energy component which is proportional to the mass of the vector particle @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , several ( non)-minimally coupled vector field models with a potential for the vector field were considered and some model mimics @xmath1cdm expansion at late times . in particular , the possibility of understanding dark energy from the standard electromagnetic field , without the need of introducing new physics was explored recently @xcite and it was shown that the presence of a temporal electromagnetic field on cosmological scales generates an effective cosmological constant which can account for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "in this paper we attempt investigations on the cosmological consequences of the massive spinor electrodynamics where both spinor and vector sectors come into play , but they are non - minimally coupled to gravitation .",
    "one could naively expect that the pressureless dark matter term @xcite coming from the spinor sector and the effective cosmological constant @xcite coming from the massless vector sector could combine to yield a dark energy model whose cosmological evolution mimics that of the standard @xmath1cdm model .",
    "however , one finds out immediately that this anticipation is not met by an explicit check of the equations of motion , because the theory has an interaction between the spinor and the vector field .",
    "it turns out that such a difficulty can be overcome by introducing a massive vector field and torsion @xcite component along with a specific non - minimal interaction between them into the theory .",
    "they can intervene between the two sectors and alleviate the difficulties coming from the interaction .",
    "consequently , we find that cosmology of massive spinor electrodynamics provides a dark energy model where the dark energy and dark matter are interacting with each other through the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "it is found that the model allows an asymptotic de sitter acceleration , which is an attractor .",
    "when dark energy dominance has taken place at late times , the spinor provides dark matter density , whereas the massive vector field and torsion contribute to both dark energy and dark matter densities .",
    "one of the interesting aspects as a consequence is that the dark energy density is directly proportional to the mass squared of the vector fields .",
    "another distinctive feature coming from the cosmology of massive spinor electrodynamics is that the dynamics allows a very small fraction of the energy density evolving as @xmath3 at late times .",
    "we check whether the presence of this energy density is consistent with the observational data by giving a detailed analysis of how much of such a deviation from @xmath1cdm can be allowed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we give a classical formalism of massive spinor electrodynamics in curved space - time with torsion . in sec .",
    "3 , we investigate the cosmology of massive spinor electrodynamics and show that it can provide a field theoretical model of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "we find de sitter solution and perform an asymptotic expansion to show that an additional energy density component of the form @xmath3 is present in this approach . in sec . 4 , we present data analysis in order to test whether @xmath1cdm+ @xmath4 can be consistent with observations . sec .",
    "5 includes conclusion and discussions .",

    "it is important to note that @xmath11 is anti - symmetric for last two indices and @xmath12 anti - symmetric for first two indices .",
