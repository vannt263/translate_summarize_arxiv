    "to construct networks of size @xmath14 we use the molloy - reed algorithm  @xcite , and apply it to the degree distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ pdk ] ) .",
    "simulations for this type of network have been performed before in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 and 200  @xcite .",
    "we perform our simulations for many values of @xmath10 but we present our results only for @xmath33 . our main results also hold for other degree distributions . due to the fact that the lower degree is @xmath30  @xcite and",
    "@xmath10 is small , the network is very fragmented and the size of the initial biggest connected cluster ( gc ) , labeled here as @xmath34 , is typically @xmath35 of the network ( for @xmath33 ) . for all our simulations we work only on the gc of the original network because we are only concerned with the disease spread on connected communities .",
    "isolated clusters can not propagate a disease .",
    "to simulate sir , we chose one node at random on the gc of the substrate network , and infect it .",
    "per time step , this infected node has a probability @xmath17 to infect its first neighbors .",
    "once a neighbor has been infected , it can infect one of its own susceptible neighbors , but it can not be infected again nor infect another already infected or recovered node .",
    "all infected nodes recover after @xmath18 time steps of becoming infected  @xcite .",
    "the transmissibility @xmath3 is the overall probability that a node infects one of its susceptible neighbors within the time frame @xmath36 to @xmath18 , given by @xmath37 . for every realization of sir ,",
    "the total number of nodes that become infected after the infectious transmission has ended is given by @xmath13 .",
    "the values of @xmath13 satisfy a distribution @xmath38 .    as mentioned in the introduction , another way to calculate",
    "@xmath13 is through the use of link percolation .",
    "this is a process in which an initial network is modified by removing a fraction @xmath39 of its links ( we use @xmath3 as the probability for a link to be present because of the mapping between link percolation and our sir model ) .",
    "the effect of the removal is to generate a multitude of clusters , each being a group of nodes that can be reached from each other by following a sequence of edges connected to those nodes .",
    "link percolation has a threshold value @xmath40 ( the percolation threshold ) , characterized by the fact that , for @xmath41 , the size of the largest cluster typically scales as @xmath42 , and for @xmath43 , a large cluster emerges with a size that scales linearly with @xmath14 , alongside a number of small clusters .",
    "thus , a so - called percolation transition occurs at @xmath40 that takes the network from disconnected to connected .",
    "in general terms , a similar situation occurs in sir , where a high likelihood of transmission of the disease ( large @xmath3 ) between neighbors typically leads to a large epidemic , but if this likelihood is low ( small @xmath3 ) , only small localized outbreaks appear ( a detailed description of the relation is developed below ) .    to perform link percolation , we begin in the gc of the substrate network , and randomly eliminate links with probability @xmath39 .",
    "each realization of this process yields multiple connected clusters of various sizes .",
    "realizations are then repeated multiple times , and a distribution of cluster sizes @xmath44 emerges . for the quantity @xmath22 , we average over the largest cluster size produced in each realization .",
    "the relation between sir and link percolation can be concretely explained in the following way : each sir realization begins with a randomly chosen node of the gc , and the infection propagates to a set of nodes @xmath13 that can all be traced back to the original infection .",
    "the links used in this sir realization , on average , where used with probability @xmath3 and not used with probability @xmath39 . to draw the correct connection to link percolation , we first must realize that in a given realization of percolation , only one of the many connected clusters can be chosen to represent the infection of sir . by analogy with the classic leath algorithm  @xcite of cluster creation in percolation",
    ", we can conclude that the clusters are randomly picked , with probability proportional to their size @xmath45 .",
    "thus , one expects that the average size of sir realizations is equivalent to a weighted average of percolation realizations , where the weight is given by @xmath45 .    with the previous arguments in mind , and given the dependence of the problem on both @xmath3 and @xmath0 ,",
    "we compute @xmath20 through  @xcite @xmath46 in order to compare this to link percolation , we perform a weighted average to obtain @xmath47 , given by @xmath48 we expect that both averages converge to the same value when enough realizations are performed . additionally , as @xmath0 is increased , we expect @xmath49 for @xmath43 , because a progressively smaller number of small clusters enters into the averaging , and only the largest clusters are used .",
    "this creates an interesting scenario , in which @xmath22 is a good approximation of the epidemic size only in the limit of a large threshold @xmath50 ( a function of @xmath3 only , defined below ) , but for smaller @xmath0 , which is important in more aggressive diseases , only @xmath47 is the correct average .",
    "as a first step , we test that indeed @xmath20 and @xmath51 are equal . in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] we plot @xmath52 and @xmath53 to check their agreement .",
    "the two curves overlap indicating that the mapping between the two quantities is correct . in the reminder ( unless explicitly stated ) , we perform our simulations using link percolation as opposed to sir .    the mapping between the steady state of sir and link percolation is computationally very convenient for several reasons .",
    "first , performing simulations of sir models is computationally more costly than link percolation .",
    "this is due to the fact that for sir , only a single propagation occurs per realization , as opposed to multiple clusters that appear for link percolation .",
    "additionally , sir propagation has to be performed in a dynamic fashion , which makes it necessary to test over time a given propagation condition , something that does not occur for link percolation , accelerating further the simulations . finally , this mapping is convenient because it gives another conceptual framework in which to understand the relation between these two problems of disease propagation and percolation models .",
    "a final feature of fig .  [ fig.1 ] is the plot of @xmath22 .",
    "this curve displays good agreement with @xmath20 for the larger @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss this issue further in the next subsection .      in fig .",
    "[ fig.2a ] a ) , we plot @xmath47 to explore the effect of @xmath0 on this average .",
    "we can see from the plot that only for larger @xmath0 ( for our simulation parameters @xmath54 ) the curves of @xmath55 and @xmath51 coincide for @xmath56 @xmath57for@xmath58 , while for smaller @xmath0 values they do not .",
    "the need to use large @xmath0 to approach @xmath22 had been realized previously  @xcite , but not been commented on in any detail .",
    "we can see this behavior more clearly in fig.[fig.2a ] b ) , where we plot @xmath59 for different values of @xmath0 and find that @xmath60 is an upper bound of @xmath47 , except for very large @xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.2a ] b ) , we can see that the difference reaches approximately @xmath61 for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 has an extra consequence , which is to change the likelihood that a given pathogen propagation be declared as an epidemic .",
    "this probability is relevant from the standpoint of readiness , because lower @xmath0 implies that it is more likely to consider almost any disease propagation as reaching the epidemic state .",
    "thus , we define @xmath4 which represents the probability that an sir with transmissibility @xmath3 has size @xmath21 .",
    "this quantity can be computed directly as the number of times @xmath21 divided by the total number of realizations ( see fig .  [ fig.6 ] ) .",
    "analytically , @xmath4 can be related to @xmath62 through @xmath63 where the last equality is a consequence of normalization . in order to calculate @xmath4 from the percolation results",
    ", we keep in mind the reweighting applied to eq .",
    "( [ mp ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath4 is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 . in fig .",

    "several @xmath4 regimes can be identified : ( i ) for @xmath81 , the contribution of @xmath82 is negligible and therefore @xmath83 ; ( ii ) for @xmath84 , @xmath4 becomes dominated by a competition between the two terms of the integral and no clear scaling rules apply ; ( iii ) for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and ; ( iv ) for @xmath87 , @xmath88 . from fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] we can identify those four regimes . in the figure the arrow represents approximately @xmath89 from the simulation .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical scaling ( see eq .",
    "( [ q_int ] ) ) and the simulation is excellent .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath76 can be estimated from the fact that , for a system size @xmath90 , the first term of @xmath68 accounts for the finite clusters present , and the integral of @xmath91 must be equal to the mass of the finite clusters . therefore @xmath92\\sim",

    "the effects shown here hold also for other networks including real networks as shown below .",
    "one final result that can be derived from @xmath68 is the value of @xmath0 for which @xmath22 is a good approximation for @xmath47 .",
    "from the previous results , we note that there is a `` gap '' in the distribution of sizes between @xmath73 and @xmath94 , which means that percolation generates very few clusters between these sizes .",
    "thus , when determining @xmath47 , the significant statistical contributions are concentrated in clusters smaller than @xmath73 and then in @xmath94 . for @xmath95 , only the latter term contributes , driving @xmath96 .",
    "it is important to recognize that this result is independent of the system size @xmath34 , but not of @xmath3 , as @xmath73 is a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the results we have presented for our model of human infectious disease propagation is applicable to other problems in the real world .",
    "this can be well illustrated for computer networks in which information is being broadcasted .",
    "one of the networks that describes the functional connectivity of the internet is the traceroute network , where the nodes are the routers and the links are the connection between them that transport ip packets . the network , as measured in ref .",
    "@xcite , has @xmath97 nodes and @xmath98 links .",
    "this network can be represented by a scale - free network with @xmath99  @xcite . in order to obtain information of the internet connectivity ,",
    "a software probe is used called a tracerouter tool , that sends ip packets on the internet eliciting a reply from the targeted host . by citing the information of the packets path to the various destinations ,",
    "a network of router adjacencies is build  @xcite . here , the sir process can be understood as a router that has a random failure ( infected ) , that can produce failures on neighbor nodes that are functional ( susceptible ) , and these new nodes become infected .",
    "thus , after some time the router is practically disconnected from the communication network ( removed ) . the dimes network  @xcite uses the same algorithm of searching than the tracerouter network , the nodes are autonomous systems ( as ) and the links are the connections between as .",
    "the network has @xmath100 nodes and @xmath101 links .",
    "the description of the sir process over dimes is the same as the one explained before for the tracerouter network .    in figs .",

    "for tracerouter and @xmath104 for dimes network we can map this problem to @xmath22 of link percolation .",

    "( [ q_int ] ) ) .",
    "we have shown that the choice of @xmath0 , the minimum sir propagation size necessary to declare an epidemic , has important consequences on epidemiological predictions .",
    "using percolation theory to calculate the average fractional size @xmath106 of an epidemic , we find that the strength of the spanning link percolation cluster @xmath22 is an upper bound to @xmath20 , provided @xmath0 does not exceed @xmath107 , the typical size of finite clusters of link percolation , where pathological results can appear . when @xmath0 is between @xmath108 and @xmath107 , @xmath22 is a good approximation to @xmath20 . for small values of @xmath0 , @xmath2 is no longer a good approximation , and the average fractional size has to be computed directly .",
