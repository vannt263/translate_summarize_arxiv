    "when electron collides elastically with open - shell atom or molecule , they can exchange their spins .",
    "thus , spin polarization of the electron beam is in general reduced after scattering with unpolarized open - shell targets .",
    "we can obtain more precise information of the scattering process by studying this depolarization @xcite , which is difficult to observe in usual experiment with spin - averaging procedure .",
    "collisions of spin - polarized electrons with atoms have been studied for long years ( see hegemann et al.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , number of experiment on electron molecule system is limited .",
    "ratliff et al.@xcite measured rate constants for electron exchange in elastic electron collisions with o@xmath0 @xmath3 and no @xmath4 molecules in thermal energies .",
    "their spin - exchange rate constants are substantially smaller than those in electron hydrogen - atom or alkali - metal - atom collisions .",
    "hegemann et al.@xcite studied exchange process in elastic electron collisions with o@xmath0 @xmath3 and no @xmath4 molecules and na @xmath5 atoms .",
    "they measured ratio of spin - polarizations in electron beams before and after collisions , i.e. , polarization fraction , which is directly related to the spin - exchange differential cross sections .",
    "as in the work of ratliff et al.@xcite , hegemann et al.@xcite confirmed that the exchange cross sections of electron molecule collisions are much smaller than those of electron collisions with atoms .",
    "although absolute value of spin - exchange cross section is small , the degree of spin - exchange in electron o@xmath0 collisions becomes larger at 100 degrees with collision energies between 8 and 15 ev compared to the other angles and energies , which they attributed to the existence of the o@xmath6 @xmath2 resonance .",
    "theoretical study of spin - exchange in electron o@xmath0 collisions was performed by da paixao et al.@xcite .",
    "they used the schwinger multichannel method with the three lowest electronic states of o@xmath0 in their model , and confirmed that spin - exchange cross section is small in electron o@xmath0 @xmath3 elastic scatterings .",
    "although exchange cross sections are small for electron collisions with randomly oriented o@xmath0 , they observed large depolarization at some scattering angles when electrons were scattered from spatially oriented o@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the profile of depolazation as a function of scattering angle depends strongly on molecular orientation .",
    "based on these resuls , da paixao et al.@xcite explained for the first time that the experimental exchange cross section in electron - molecule collisions is small because averaging over molecular orientation washes out depolarization effects .",
    "fullerton et al.@xcite , nordbeck et al.@xcite and wste et al.@xcite used the r - matrix method to calculate polarization fractions in electron o@xmath0 collisions .",
    "the calculations of fullerton et al.@xcite and nordbeck et al.@xcite employed the fixed bond approximation with t - matrix elements obtained by the nine - state r - matrix calculation of noble and burke @xcite , whereas wste et al.@xcite used vibrational averaging of t - matrices to include the effect of nuclear motion .",
    "the fixed bond r - matrix calculations of fullerton et al.@xcite and nordbeck et al.@xcite confirmed the results of da paixao et al.@xcite .",
    "agreement with experimental results at energies from 10 to 15 ev is marginal , as in the calculation of da paixao et al.@xcite .",
    "the vibrational averaging procedure of wste et al.@xcite improved agreement with the experimental results in this energy region .",
    "machado et al.@xcite applied the schwinger variational iterative method combined with the distorted - wave approximation and obtained similar elastic e - o@xmath0 polarization fractions to those of fullerton et al.@xcite .",
    "other than electron o@xmath0 collisions , theoretical work of spin exchange in electron molecule collisions is scarce .",
    "da paixao et al.@xcite calculated polarization fractions in electron no @xmath4 elastic collisions as they did in electron o@xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "calculated exchange effect was small in e - no elastic collisions , in agreement with the experimental results of hegemann et al.@xcite .",
    "sartori et al.@xcite studied spin - exchange in the superelastic electron collisions with h@xmath0 c @xmath7 state using the schwinger multichannel method . large depolarization was observed in their results , intermediate between depolarizations in e - na and e - o@xmath0 collisions .",
    "recently , fujimoto et al.@xcite performed the iterative schwinger variational calculation of spin - exchange effect in elastic electron c@xmath0o @xmath8 collisions .",
    "they found modest depolarization near resonances , however , spin - exchange effect was very small in other energy region .",
    "recently , we have studied electron o@xmath0 scatterings by the r - matrix method with improved molecular orbitals and increased number of target states@xcite compared to the previous theoretical studies .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the previous experimental results .",
    "since the previous theoretical polarization fractions of elastic e - o@xmath0 collisions at energies between 10 and 15ev agree not so well with the experimental results , it would be interesting to examine how spin - exchange cross section will change in this energy region by our improved calculational parameters . at the same time",
    ", it is important to understand general behaviour of spin - exchange cross sections , polarization fractions in other words , in elastic electron molecule collisions . until now ,",
    "spin - exchange effect in low - energy electron molecule elastic scattering has been studied only for no and c@xmath0o molecules other than o@xmath0 .",
    "thus it is desirable to study spin - exchange in other electron - molecule scattering systems as well . in this work ,",
    "we study spin - exchange in electron o@xmath0 collisions with the same calculational parameters as we used in our previous works@xcite .",
    "in addition , we calculate spin - exchange cross section in elastic electron collisions with b@xmath0 , s@xmath0 and si@xmath0 molecules .",
    "these b@xmath0 , s@xmath0 and si@xmath0 are stable homo - nuclear molecules with @xmath9 symmetry in their ground states , as in o@xmath0 molecule .    in this paper , details of the calculations are presented in section 2 , and we discuss the results in section 3 comparing our results with previous theoretical and available experiments . then the summary is given in section 4 .",
    "in this work , we consider elastic scattering of spin - polarized electrons from randomly oriented unpolarized molecules . when the incident electrons have spin polarization @xmath10 and the scattered electrons have polarization @xmath11 , with the polarization direction perpendicular to the scattering plane , the polarization fraction , the ratio of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , is a measure of spin - exchange and is related to the spin - flip differential cross section ( dcs ) @xmath12 as @xcite , @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the dcs obtained by unpolarized electrons .",
    "the dcss of @xmath14 and @xmath12 are evaluated by the spin - specific scattering amplitude @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 specify the states of the target molecule as well as the scattering electron in the initial and final channels , respectively . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the initial and final wavenumber of the electron , @xmath20 is the rotation matrix with the euler angles @xmath21 representing orientation of the target molecule in the laboratory frame .",
    "the electron is scattered to the direction @xmath22 in the laboratory frame in this expression .",
    "the t - matrix elements @xmath23 are prepared for all possible spin @xmath24 of the electron - molecule system as well as all irreducible representation @xmath25 of the symmetry of the system .",
    "we used @xmath26 in the r - matrix calculations .",
    "since the target molecules have triplet spin symmetry in this work , we only include @xmath27 and @xmath28 in our calculations .",
    "the matrix element @xmath29 relates the spherical harmonics @xmath30 to the real spherical harmonics @xmath31 .",
    "the explicit expression of @xmath29 can be found in our previous paper @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider elastic scattering of electron from molecule with triplet spin symmetry .",
    "then , @xmath14 and @xmath12 are expressed by the spin specific amplitude @xmath32 as @xcite ,    @xmath33    and @xmath34 here summations over channel indices are omitted for notational simplicity .",
    "note that the expression of the spin - flip dcs contains interference of amplitudes with different spin multiplicities .",
    "since the target molecules are randomly oriented , these dcss are averaged over all possible molecular orientations in space .      the t - matrix elements @xmath23 were obtained by a modified version of the polyatomic programs in the uk molecular r - matrix codes @xcite .",
    "general procedure of calculation is almost the same as in our previous works@xcite .",
    "since the r - matrix method itself has been described extensively in the literature @xcite and references therein , we do not repeat general explanation of the method here .    in this work ,",
    "elastic electron collisions with o@xmath0 , b@xmath0 , s@xmath0 and si@xmath0 molecules were studied . for electron o@xmath0 scattering",
    ", we used the same parameter set as we used in the previous works@xcite .",
    "specifically , we employed the equilibrium bond length of 2.300 a@xmath35 for o@xmath0 , the r matrix radius of 10 a@xmath35 .",
    "the angular quantum number of the scattering electron was included up to @xmath36=5 .",
    "the atomic basis set for bound molecular orbitals , number of the target states included in the model as well as choice of the configurations in the inner region calculation were the same .",

    "symmetries and spin - multiplicities of these states are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "these target states were represented by valence configuration interaction wave functions constructed by the state averaged complete active space scf ( sa - casscf ) orbitals .",
    "fixed - bond approximation was employed with internuclear distances of 3.036 , 3.700 and 4.400 a@xmath35 for b@xmath0 , s@xmath0 and si@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "although we study only elastic scattering in this work , we included these excited target states to improve quality of the r - matrix calculations .",
    "also , by including these excited states , we can suppress artificial structure coming from pseudo - resonance . in this study ,",
    "the sa - casscf orbitals were obtained by calculations with molpro suites of programs @xcite .",
    "the target orbitals of b@xmath0 , s@xmath0 and si@xmath0 were constructed from the cc - pvtz basis set@xcite .",
    "the radius of the r - matrix sphere was chosen to be 13 a@xmath35 , which is larger than the r - matrix sphere used in the electron o@xmath0 calculation .",
    "we need this extended r - matrix sphere to avoid overlap of b@xmath0 , s@xmath0 and si@xmath0 molecular orbitals with the r - matrix boundary . in order to represent the scattering electron , we included diffuse gaussian functions up to @xmath36 = 4 , with 13 functions for @xmath36 = 0 , 11 functions for @xmath36 = 1 , 10 functions for @xmath36 = 2 , 8 functions for @xmath36 = 3 , 6 functions for @xmath36 = 4 .",
    "exponents of these diffuse gaussians were taken from faure et al . @xcite .",
    "the construction of the configuration state functions ( csfs ) for the electron - molecule system is the same as in our previous e - o@xmath0 papers @xcite .",
    "two different kind of ( @xmath37)-electron configurations are included , where @xmath38 is a number of electrons in the target molecule .",
    "the first type of the ( @xmath37)-electron csfs is constructed from @xmath38 target molecular orbitals ( mos ) plus one continuum orbital . the second type of csfs is constructed from the @xmath37 target mos .",
    "these target mos are just the sa - casscf orbitals , whereas the continuum orbitals are obtained by orthogonalization of the diffuse gaussian functions to the target mos @xcite .",
    "since only the continuum orbitals have overlap with the r - matrix sphere , the first type of csfs mainly contributes the cross sections .",
    "however , the second type of csfs is also important , as it is crucial to describe resonance . for reference",

    "however , our casscf results agree reasonably well with their results .      in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) , integral cross sections ( icss ) for elastic electron collision with o@xmath0 molecules are shown .",

    "we checked the csfs of the @xmath39 and @xmath44 symmetry calculations and found that the configuration @xmath62 has dominant contribution to these resonances .      in figure [ fig3 ] , calculated polarization fractions ( pfs ) for elastic electron o@xmath0 collisions",

    "the results in the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) indicates that the pfs become very close to 1 by removing the configuration of the @xmath2 resonance .    in figure [ fig5 ] ( b ) , calculated pfs for elastic electron b@xmath0 collisions are shown for scattering energies of 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 and 15 ev . for most of the scattering energies and angles , the depolarization in electron b@xmath0",

    "[ fig5 ] ( b ) , the effect of the resonance on the pfs is evident . with the resonance effect ,",

    "the effect of resonance on the electron si@xmath0 pfs were examined by removing the @xmath62 configuration , which is responsible for the @xmath39 and @xmath44 resonances at 0.12 and 0.55 ev , respectively . by removing this configuration ,",
    "these two sharp peaks in the icss disappear .",
    "the pfs without the resonances are shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( b ) . for 3 ev case , the depolarization becomes smaller at all angles .",
    "however , the decrease of depolarization is not so large compared to the cases of e - b@xmath0 and e - s@xmath0 collisions . for 5 ev case , the depolarization at 85 degrees becomes larger , though it becomes smaller at backward angles .",
    "thus , in this case , the association of the resonances with the depolarization is not so straightforward as in the e - o@xmath0 , b@xmath0 and s@xmath0 cases .",
    "as we show in the figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , existence of resonance and behaviour of pf is closely related each other .",
    "when resonance exists at some energy , relatively large depolarization is observed compared to the other energies . also , when the resonance is artificially removed by deleting specific configuration in the r - matrix calculation , depolarization becomes smaller in general . in case of electron si@xmath0 collisions , this trend is partly broken at 5 ev around 80 degrees , however , depolarization generally becomes smaller at the other region after removing the resonance effect .",
    "the association of resonance and pf has been discussed in the previous theoretical and experimental papers @xcite , and we have confirmed this association more clearly by explicitly studying the effect of resonance on the pf of four different electron - molecule systems .    even if collision occurs away from the resonance energy , some degree of depolarization is observed in all cases of e - o@xmath0 , b@xmath0 , s@xmath0 and si@xmath0 collisions . in e - b@xmath0 case , depolarization is relatively large even outside of the resonance energy region .",
    "in contrast , the pfs in e - o@xmath0 collisions are very close to 1 when collision energy is distant from the resonance energy .",
    "the degree of depolarization in e - s@xmath0 and si@xmath0 collisions is intermediate between e - b@xmath0 and e - o@xmath0 depolarizations .",
    "it is unclear why different degree of depolarization is seen in these four electron - molecule collisions when collision energy is distant from resonance .",
    "the extent of molecular orbitals may be related to this difference , as discussed by sartori et al.@xcite on the electron h@xmath0 superelastic collisions .    for the electron o@xmath0 elastic scattering ,",
    "the previous theoretical and experimental pfs are available for comparison with our results .",
    "our low energy pfs at 5 and 10 ev are similar to the other theoretical results .",
    "however , the pfs at 12ev are smaller than the previous results at all angles , and our pfs at 15ev are much closer to unity than the other theoretical results as shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the reason of these deviations can be attributed to the shift of o@xmath6 @xmath2 resonance position . in our calculation , the position of the @xmath2 resonance peak is located around 13.0 ev , whereas it is around 14.1 ev in the previous r - matrix calculation . as discussed in wste et al.@xcite ,",
    "the position of the @xmath2 resonance is sensitive to the internuclear distance . in this work ,",
    "the internuclear length is fixed to be 2.3 a0 and it is the same as in the calculation of fullerton et al.@xcite .",
    "so the choice of basis set , molecular orbitals and number of target states is important to the difference in the position of the resonance . probably the position of resonance is stabilized by inclusion of more target states in the present r - matrix calculations compared to the previous calculations of fullerton et al.@xcite , machado et al.@xcite and da paixo et al.@xcite . in figure [ fig1 ] ( b ) , sharp increase of cross section is observed in electron b@xmath0 elastic scattering near zero energy .",
    "this increase of cross section is similar to the case of electron polar - molecule collision , although b@xmath0 molecule has no dipole moment .",
    "the cross section of electron co@xmath0 elastic collision also has similar sharp increase near zero energy , and several experimental and theoretical works have been performed to understand this behaviour .",
    "morrison analyzed this problem and suggested that this behaviour is related to the existence of a virtual state @xcite .",
    "morgan has shown that the correlation and polarization effect is important for this sharp peak @xcite .",
    "similar mechanism may exist for the electron b@xmath0 elastic collisions .",
    "for the electron o@xmath0 elastic collisions , we put larger number of target electronic states and better quality molecular orbitals in the r - matrix calculations , and obtained improved results around @xmath2 resonance region compared to the previous fixed - bond calculations . however , the results of wste et al.@xcite agree better with the experimental pfs at 10 ev .",
    "they achieved this good agreement by vibrational averaging of the t - matrices to include the effect of the nuclear motion . by extending the present r - matrix calculation to include the vibrational effect using vibrational averaging procedure or the non - adiabatic r - matrix method , we may obtain better agreement with the experimental pfs .",
    "also , inclusion of nuclear motion effect may improve the quality of the calculations on electron b@xmath0 , s@xmath0 and si@xmath0 elastic collisions .",
