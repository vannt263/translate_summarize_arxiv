    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are very unusual astrophysical objects .",
    "their stellar masses are comparable to those of massive globular clusters ( harris 1996 ) , but unlike globular clusters , which are dense and compact , dsphs are very extended and diffuse assemblies of stars .",
    "their limiting radii exceed those of globular clusters by several hundreds ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) and reach several kpc , while the velocity dispersion of their stars again is comparable to what is measured in globular clusters .",
    "this makes them unusual in the sense that if dsphs were bound objects in virial equilibrium , then their gravitational mass as implied by the velocity dispersion must exceed the luminous mass observed in stars by one to two orders of magnitude .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies therefore are often claimed to be completely dominated by invisible dark matter ( see , e.g. , the review on that subject by mateo 1997 ) .",
    "the assumption of virial equilibrium , however , may be challenged since many dsphs orbit massive @xmath0-type galaxies like our milky way and are therefore subject to strong tidal torques .",
    "this influences their internal dynamics , and may bring them on the brink of disruption as is claimed for the nearby dsph ursa minor ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 ) or even complete dissolution as observed in the case of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( ibata , gilmore , & irwin 1994 ) .",
    "it is therefore a valid approach to hypothesize that many , if not all , dsph companions of the milky way may be the remnants of tidally disrupted satellites without appreciable amounts of dark matter .",
    "the ` tidal scenario ' has received considerable attention . in early studies , kuhn & miller ( 1989 ) concentrated on the effects of resonant coupling between orbital and internal motions , while kuhn ( 1993 ) investigated diffusion in phase and configuration space of assemblies of stars orbiting various rigid potentials .",
    "both studies concluded that indeed tidal effects could mimic the observed large mass - to - light ratios .",
    "the opposite conclusion was derived by oh lin , & aarseth ( 1995 ) who included the effects of the satellites self - gravity into their studies , and by piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) who focused on tidal effects during the satellites perigalactic passage .",
    "further discussion on tidal mass loss can be found in helmi & white ( 1999 ) , johnston , sigurdsson , & hernquist ( 1999 ) , bekki , couch , & drinkwater ( 2001 ) .",
    "the most detailed models of the long - term evolution of low - mass satellite galaxies in the tidal field of the milky way have been discussed by kroupa ( 1997 ) and klessen & kroupa ( 1998 ) who demonstrated that a remnant containing a few percent of the initial mass prevails as a long - lived and distinguishable entity for a period of several billion years after the initial satellite dissolves .",
    "they proposed that what appears to be a bound dsph galaxy to a terrestrial observer may in fact be the unbound remnant of a tidally disrupted satellite galaxy on an eccentric orbit with two tidal arms extending along a small angle from the line of sight of a terrestrial observer .",
    "this model successfully demonstrates that high velocity dispersions in dsphs may be obtained without internal dark matter .",
    "it also accounts for the distorted morphology of , e.g. , the double - peaked dsph ursa minor ( e.g. , kleyna et al .",
    "the tidal model furthermore predicts an appreciable spread in stellar distance moduli as the tidal remnant will have considerable depth along the observer s line of sight , which is an observationally testable prediction .",
    "another model prediction is a radial velocity gradient during most of the evolution after tidal disintegration .",
    "these effects have been studied in detail by klessen & zhao ( 2002 ) , who suggested to use the width of the horizontal branch ( hb ) in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) as possible test for the tidal origin of the galactic dsphs ( see also klessen & kroupa 1998 ) .    in our current investigation",
    "we apply the hb test to the nearby dsph galaxy in the constellation of draco .",
    "our goal is to construct a tidal model for draco that complies with _ all _ observational properties of the galaxy known to date .",
    "we will see that this attempt fails , and we thus claim that draco can not be of tidal origin .",
    "this implies that either draco is strongly dark - matter dominated , or , alternatively , that modifications to the law of gravity are necessary ( milgrom 1983 , 1995 ; see sanders & mcgaugh 2002 for a review ) .",
    "we focus on draco , because it is particularly well suited for testing the tidal model .",
    "draco is the only dsph to - date for which high - quality , deep , multi - color ccd imaging exists covering both draco as well as a seven times larger region than its tidal radius .",
    "draco is a close satellite galaxy of our milky way .",
    "its compact and seemingly undistorted morphological appearance ( odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001a ) as well as its thin hb in the cmd can be used to define stringent constraints on tidal models .",
    "our line of reasoning is as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : draco ] , we discuss morphological and kinematic properties of draco .",
    "we use public data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , see york et al .",
    "2000 ; gunn et al .",
    "1998 ; and stoughton et al .",
    "2002 for more information ) to determine the width of the hb of draco . in section [ sec : model ] , we attempt to construct an appropriate model for the tidal origin of draco .",
    "our finding is that this is not possible .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : summary ] we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "if dsphs are unbound tidal remnants , then nearby dsphs provide the best test objects since here we can study the then expected depth effects with the greatest precision .",
    "draco is a nearby milky way satellite at a distance of only @xmath1 80 kpc . with an absolute magnitude of @xmath2 mag , a central surface brightness of @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 , and lack of detectable gas ( m@xmath5 m@xmath6 ) , it is a typical low - luminosity local group dsph ( see grebel 2000 and grebel , gallagher , & harbeck 2003 for a recent compilation of local group dsph properties ) .",
    "draco is dominated by metal - poor stellar populations older than 10 gyr and possesses a well - populated hb ( e.g. , stetson , mcclure , & vandenberg 1985 ; grillmair et al .",
    "1998 ; aparicio , carrera , & martnez - delgado 2001 ) .",
    "the metallicity spread observed in draco ( e.g. , carney & seitzer 1986 ; shetrone , ct , & sargent 2001 ) shows that its early star formation history was extended and complex , unlike that of a globular cluster .",
    "draco and its surroundings have been mapped in their entirety with deep , homogeneous five - color photometry by the sdss .",
    "the sdss obtains ccd imaging in the passbands _ u _ , _ g _ , _ r _ , _ i _ , and _ z _ of a contiguous region of @xmath7 deg@xmath8 centered on the north galactic cap .",
    "the public data presented here are part of the sdss early data release ( edr , stoughton et al .",
    "the sdss multi - color photometric database permits one to employ optimized filtering techniques to enhance the signal of the stellar population associated with the target of interest versus contaminants such as foreground stars , and to remove background galaxies based on shape parameters ( see odenkirchen et al .  2001a , b for details ) .",
    "the sdss also provides corrections for galactic foreground extinction using schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) maps .",
    "odenkirchen et al .",
    "( 2001a ) carried out a morphological study of draco based on these sdss data covering more than 27 deg@xmath8 of the galaxy itself and its surroundings , extending earlier photographic work by irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) .",
    "odenkirchen et al",
    ".  found draco to exhibit a flattened stellar surface density distribution with constant ellipticity ( @xmath9 , position angle @xmath10 ) . the limiting radius of draco is @xmath11 along the major axis from an empirical king profile ( king 1962 ) , and @xmath12 from a theoretical king profile ( king 1966 ) , which is 41% to 75% more extended than found in the earlier photographic study of irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) .",
    "overdensities consistent with the presence of extratidal stars were not detected down to a level of @xmath13 of draco s central surface density or to a surface brightness of @xmath14 mag arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "odenkirchen et al.point out that that draco s density profile may be equally well fitted by a srsic profile with an exponent of @xmath15 , since there is no detectable break in the profile , which may indicate an even more extended distribution below the current detection limit .",
    "the isopleths of draco s stellar surface density are highly regular , nested ellipses that retain the same position angle with increasing distance from the dsph s center .",
    "these properties led odenkirchen et al .  to infer that draco is bound and strongly dark - matter dominated .",
    "aparicio et al .  ( 2001 ) used b and r ccd photometry covering 1 square degree including parts of draco and some of its surroundings .",
    "they also found a large tidal radius ( @xmath16 ) and no evidence for extratidal stars .",
    "another structural study of mostly non - contiguous ccd imaging in draco and surroundings covering a total area of @xmath17 square degrees in v and r was carried out by piatek et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and again confirmed the lack of extratidal stars .",
    "a recent ccd study of the central part of draco ( 0.17 deg@xmath4 ; bellazzini et al .  2002 ) using the v and i filters also found the smooth elliptical isopleths presented by odenkirchen et al .",
    ". aparicio et al .  ( 2001 ) compared draco s cmd to one of the models proposed by kroupa ( 1997 ) , rs1 - 4 , according to which draco is extended along the line of sight . using the width of the hb of draco , particularly of the red hb , they found an upper limit of @xmath18 kpc for draco s depth extent , which is at most one third of the extent predicted by kroupa s model .",
    "aparicio et al .",
    "conclude that their upper limit precludes the explanation of draco s velocity dispersion as caused entirely by projection effects , and that dark matter is a more likely culprit .",
    "finally , kleyna et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) studied the radial velocity dispersion of draco s red giants as a function of projected distance out to a distance of @xmath19 from draco s center . from this inner region",
    "they infer that draco has a gradually rising rotation curve and is embedded in an extended dark matter halo rather than a halo in which mass follows light .",
    "kleyna et al.s ( 2001 ) calculations suggest that draco is close to its perigalacticon and that its tidal radius exceeds @xmath20 .      taking advantage of the large area coverage afforded by the sdss data , we investigate the distribution of hb stars in draco and surroundings .",
    "as compared to conventional ccd imaging data , the sdss data allow us to study the entire projected area within which models of the kind calculated by kroupa ( 1997 ) , klessen & kroupa ( 1998 ) , klessen & zhao ( 2002 ) , and in the current paper predict stars originating from a disrupted dsph galaxy without dark matter .",
    "furthermore , the sdss database allows us to exclude objects identified as galaxies or as quasars based on their shape parameters or location in multi - color space ( see , e.g. , richards et al .",
    "2001 ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the red hb of draco is heavily contaminated by galactic foreground stars ( fig .",
    "[ draco_sample_cmd ] ) , particularly by the metal - weak galactic halo main sequence and , to a lesser extent , by main - sequence stars from the thick disk ( chen et al .",
    "while we can easily perform statistical field star subtractions in the color - luminosity range of draco s hb , this contamination hampers our ability to determine the _ width _ of the red hb .",
    "this problem becomes particularly severe at larger distances from the center of draco , where the stellar density of draco drops rapidly .",
    "we therefore decided not to include red hb stars in our analysis .",
    "( 11.0 , 9.0 ) ( -1.0,-0.7 )    apart from a well - populated red hb , draco contains a sizeable number of rr lyrae stars , which overlap with the red hb locus and become , on average , increasingly more luminous toward bluer colors ( e.g. , bellazzini et al .",
    "2002 ; their figure 6 ) . to avoid uncertainties in luminosity ( and hence width ) introduced by rr lyrae variables , we excluded their loci from our analysis as well .",
    "this leaves us with the blue hb .",
    "while draco s blue hb is sparsely populated in comparison to the red hb , blue stars generally have the advantage of being easily recognizable even in regions where galactic field stars dominate otherwise , since galactic field star contamination is very low at these blue colors . the field star contribution in the area of the red hb amounts to @xmath21 objects per square degree , while for the blue hb it is only @xmath22 deg@xmath4 .",
    "some of the latter contaminants may be unidentified quasars at redshifts between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( e.g. , fan 1999 ; richards et al .  2001 ) .",
    "many dwarf galaxies show population gradients in the sense that younger populations are more centrally concentrated than older ones ( see grebel 1997 , 1999 , 2001 for reviews ) .",
    "gradients may even exist in the old populations of dwarf galaxies : harbeck et al.(2001 ) showed that in dwarf galaxies blue hb stars often have a spatially more extended distribution than red hb stars .",
    "this `` second parameter '' variation may be caused by age or metallicity , or both , or additional factors ( e.g. , hurley - keller , mateo , & grebel 1999 ; harbeck et al .",
    "2001 ) . in draco",
    ", our analysis of the sdss data reveals that draco s hb stars follow the same trend . beyond galactocentric distances @xmath25 ( figure [ draco_hb_cumul ] )",
    ", the contribution of red hb stars decreases : the fraction of blue hb stars ( measured as the number of blue hb stars , # bhb , over the sum of # bhb and the number of red hb stars , # rhb ) increases from @xmath26% in the inner region of draco to @xmath27% in its outskirts ( figure [ draco_hb_cumul ] ) .",
    "this makes blue hb stars useful tracers of the spatial extent of draco .",
    "( 11.0 , 10.7 ) ( -1.5,-1.5 )    we choose the sdss color @xmath28 to ensure a large color baseline in two of the most sensitive sdss filters .",
    "( note that the superscript @xmath29 is conventionally used to indicate that the photometric calibration of the sdss edr data is not yet final and may be further refined in later data releases ; see also stoughton et al .",
    "the sdss g filter lies between johnson b and v and largely overlaps with these two filters , while the sdss i filter is slightly more narrow and a bit bluer than the kron - cousins i filter ( see fig .  1 in grebel 2002 ) .",
    "transformation equations between the sdss filter system and the conventional johnson - cousins system are given in fukugita et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; for the purposes of our study we will consider sdss @xmath30 as equivalent to johnson @xmath31 .",
    "all sdss magnitudes were corrected for galactic foreground extinction using the appropriate values of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which are provided by the sdss database .",
    "we show the distribution of galactic reddening in the region of draco and surroundings in fig .  1 of odenkirchen et al .   ( 2001a ) .",
    "we assume that there is no internal extinction in draco ( see , e.g. , gallagher et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the resulting dereddened sdss magnitudes are denoted @xmath32 and @xmath33 . to select blue hb stars , we considered only objects flagged as stars in the database , which in addition were required to fulfill the criteria    @xmath34 @xmath35    for the `` red '' part of the blue hb and for the extended blue hb , respectively ( fig .  [ draco_sample_cmd ] , fat dots ) .",
    "we note that while extinction properties vary with stellar temperature , these effects are anticipated to be small within the range of colors considered here and correspond to an uncertainty of at most 0.01 mag in @xmath32 ( grebel & roberts 1995 , their figure 6 , top left panel ; assuming that @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",

    "with regard to its morphology and structure , draco is one of the best studied dsph satellite galaxies of the milky way .",

    "each satellite galaxy consists of 131@xmath61072 particles , and their time evolution in the galactic tidal field is followed numerically solving the equations of motion using a standard treecode scheme ( barnes & hut 1986 ) .",
    "the galactic tidal field hereby is treated as rigid external potential .",
    "further details are given in klessen & kroupa ( 1998 ) .",
    "the first constraints on tidal models for draco can be derived from the very compact observed morphological appearance of the dwarf galaxy and the lack of ` extra - tidal ' stars .",
    "the radial profile of stellar density of draco is well described by king models ( king 1962 , 1966 ) or generalized exponentials ( e.g. , srsic 1968 ) with core radii of @xmath63 and limiting radii @xmath64 in the range @xmath65 to @xmath66 ( odenkirchen et al .  2001a ; aparicio et al .",
    "2001 ) . adopting a distance to draco of @xmath67kpc ,",
    "this corresponds to a total radius of the galaxy of about @xmath68kpc .",
    "note that the available observational data do not imply that a clear outer ` edge ' in the galaxy has been detected ( section [ subsec : morphology - draco ] ) .",
    "the only firm statement that can be made is that the stellar density drops to less than 1% of its central value within @xmath69 , where the galaxy blends into the distribution of foreground stars .",
    "the angular size of draco is very small compared to typical values reported from numerical simulations .",
    "the tidal models published to date predict limiting radii considerably in excess of @xmath70 , when the satellite galaxy is projected onto the plane of the sky of an hypothetical observer on earth after its complete dissolution , i.e. , in the phase when it clearly bears morphological and kinematic resemblance to galactic dsphs ( e.g. , figure 2 of klessen & zhao 2002 ; see also kroupa 1997 , klessen & kroupa 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , these model dsphs often appear quite elongated along the orbital trajectory and have no clear truncation radius , i.e. , exhibit a large number of ` extra - tidal ' stars .",
    "the fact that draco is compact ( i.e. , the surface density decreases by two orders of magnitude within @xmath71 ) and not very elongated ( with a ratio between minor and major axis of @xmath72 ) therefore strongly restricts the overall parameter space for tidal models .",
    "let us first consider the effect of the orbital parameters of tidal satellite galaxies on their morphological appearance for observers on earth . as a dwarf galaxy orbits around the milky way",
    ", it loses stars , which subsequently populate two extended tidal tails .",
    "after complete disruption the location of the former satellite is still discernible for one to two gyr as an enhancement of stellar density , moving along the orbital trajectory in between the leading and trailing tidal arm .",
    "this remnant slowly expands and decreases in density as its stars drift apart and populate the tidal arms .",
    "if the satellite is on a relatively circular orbit , a terrestrial observer ( being much closer to the galactic center ) would see the resulting elongated structure of the tidal debris from the ` side ' , and would recognize a low - density feature that stretches over many degrees on the plane of the sky along the orbital path , bearing little resemblance of real dsph galaxies .",
    "in addition , it would be difficult to see and distinguish this feature at all , as it is likely to blend into the distribution of galactic foreground stars . in this case only an extensive search for kinematic signatures of tidal streamers can reveal its true nature ( see , e.g. , majewski et al .",
    "2000 ; helmi & de  zeeuw 2000 ; dohm - palmer et al .",
    "2001 ; helmi , white , & springel 2002 ; kundu et al .",
    "2000 ; newberg et al .",
    "2002 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the satellite was originally on a very eccentric orbit ( as the model galaxies discussed here ) , it is likely that the viewing angle between the orbital trajectory and the line of sight of an observer on earth is very small .",
    "the tidal debris is then seen along the major axis and subsequently covers a much smaller projected area on the observer s plane of the sky , with morphological and kinematic features now similar to observed dsph galaxies ( kroupa 1997 ; klessen & kroupa 1998 ) .",
    "this ` piling up ' of stars along the line of sight makes the tidal remnant easier to detect against the galactic foreground stars , and leads to a large dispersion of stellar distance moduli , which in turn results in a widening of the distribution of stars in the cmd along the luminosity axis",
    ". this widening can be particularly well measured using hb stars , and has been suggested as a possible observational test for the tidal models ( klessen & zhao 2002 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : trajectory ] illustrates the effect of the orbital eccentricity @xmath73 on the projected morphological appearance . instead of observing satellite galaxies on different orbits ( from the same position at @xmath74kpc ) , we equivalently select a model with @xmath75 and vary the location of the observer , such that the line of sight covers a range of viewing angles @xmath76 with the orbital trajectory ( and hence the major axis of the tidal debris ) .",
    "the right - hand side of figure [ fig : trajectory ] shows that only for eccentricities that allow for @xmath77 tidal models are able to reproduce a compact and roundish morphological appearance with azimuthally averaged radial stellar density profiles .",
    "these profiles can be fit by king models or generalized exponential models and exhibit a lack of significant numbers of ` extra - tidal ' stars .",
    "this limits the parameter space for tidal models of draco to high orbital eccentricities . if draco currently were near its perigalacticon as indeed suggested by kleyna et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , then tidal models could immediately be excluded .",
    "note that small viewing angles favor projections where the major axis is perpendicular to the orbital trajectory , leading to line of sight velocity gradients that run primarily along the minor axis ( although connected to very large dispersions , see section [ subsec : vlos ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to angles @xmath78 where the elongation always lies along the orbital path ( similar to the line of sight velocity gradient ) .",
    "we selected model _ 1 _ for illustration in figure [ fig : trajectory ] , because it is the largest satellite in our suite of models and it is the one most easily disrupted .",
    "note that already in the initial bound state , it is too extended to describe draco at a distance of @xmath79kpc .",
    "it is therefore necessary to study the tidal evolution and observational appearance of satellite galaxies of smaller sizes , to see whether it is possible to find a model that better resembles the observational data .",
    "galaxies _ 2 _ to _ 4 _ are less massive than model _ 1 _ by a factor of 10 ( @xmath80m@xmath6 instead of @xmath81m@xmath6 ) and are increasingly more compact ranging in their initial stage in size from @xmath82kpc to @xmath83kpc with core radii from @xmath84kpc down to @xmath85kpc , respectively ( see table [ tab_properties ] ) .",

    "_ 3 _ needs five ( @xmath87gyr ) and model _ 4 _ seven passages ( @xmath88gyr ) to completely dissolve in the galactic tidal field .",
    "satellite galaxies of the same mass that are initially more compact would not fully dissolve over the lifetime of the galaxy on the orbit considered here .",
    "similar characteristics hold for satellites that are more massive but have a comparable size as model _",
    "4_. this limits the available parameter space of initial satellite properties ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath64 ) and motivates our choices in table [ tab_properties ] .    within the allowed parameter range smaller initial satellites lead to more compact morphological appearance of the tidal remnant after complete dissolution . in our set of four satellite galaxies , only model",
    "_ 4 _ is able to reproduce the fact that the stellar surface density of draco falls off to less than 1% within @xmath91 .",
    "figure [ fig : compactness ] illustrates this point by showing the image of the satellites as seen on earth after complete disruption at the time when they first reach distances to the observer of @xmath92kpc .",
    "the upper panel shows the projected number density @xmath93 of @xmath94-body particles per square degree on the sky ; the lower panel shows the resulting azimuthally averaged radial profile .",
    "the conversion of @xmath93 into the corresponding _ stellar _ number density @xmath95 depends on the number of particles used in the simulation , the mass of the galaxy , and assumptions about the imf .",
    "a prediction of the observed surface density of stars ( e.g. , for comparing with star count results ) furthermore depends on the sensitivity limit of the instrument used and the crowding ( number density ) of foreground stars , which gives a constant offset .",
    "for instance , the number density of particles in the central region of model _ 4 _ is @xmath96 per square degree .",
    "as the number of particles is @xmath97 and the total mass @xmath80m@xmath6 , each particle carries @xmath98m@xmath6 .",
    "we assume a standard imf as proposed by kroupa ( 2002 ) with average stellar mass @xmath99m@xmath6 and where stars with @xmath100m@xmath6 contribute roughly 50% of the mass but only 6% in number .",
    "if we furthermore assume a detection limit of @xmath68m@xmath6 , then each @xmath94-body particle represents about @xmath101 stars lying above the detection threshold , @xmath102 . for the very inner region of draco ,",
    "model _ 4 _ thus predicts star counts of order @xmath103 per square degree .",
    "this is consistent with the observed values ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ; odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001a ; aparicio et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the results of the previous section confirm that it is possible to construct tidal models that resemble the morphology of the draco dsph galaxy at least immediately after their complete disruption .",
    "however , how long does this period of time last ?",
    "this question is addressed in figure [ fig : time - evolution ] which shows the projected surface density of model _ 4 _ during various phases of its dynamical evolution under the condition that the galaxy lies at a distance of roughly @xmath79kpc to an observer on earth .",
    "the figure depicts all such instances in the time interval @xmath104gyr until the end of the simulation at @xmath105gyr .",
    "earlier times exhibit no substantial evolution in the projected stellar density distribution and only two snapshots are shown .",
    "note that the satellite completely dissolves during the seventh perigalactic passage at @xmath106gyr .",
    "the figure illustrates how the tightly bound satellite galaxy evolves into unbound debris in the tidal field of the galaxy , and how this tidal stripping process influences the observable structure .",
    "note the variation of morphological parameters ( e.g. , in the axis ratios , the position of the major axis , or the ` smoothness ' of the particle distribution ) amongst the six snapshots with @xmath107gyr .",
    "note also that only the first two snapshots after complete disintegration are compact enough to describe draco .",
    "at later times the surface density does not drop below 1% of its central value within radii of @xmath108 , largely exceeding the limiting radius of draco @xmath109 .",
    "figure [ fig : time - evolution ] therefore indicates that the time interval during which tidal models are able to reproduce properties of draco is quite limited ( to about @xmath68gyr ) .",
    "this implies that we would observe the dsph galaxy at a very special instance in time ( namely right after its tidal disruption ) if the tidal models were correct .",
    "this result is further supported by the time evolution of the line of sight velocity dispersion @xmath110 , as indicated in figure [ fig : vlos ] . for model",
    "_ 4 _ , @xmath110 lies within the observed margin @xmath111km@xmath61s@xmath112km@xmath61s@xmath62 only for a period of about 1 gyr following the complete disruption . at earlier times",
    "@xmath110 is smaller , and at later times it is larger .",
    "similar time scales hold for the other models .",
    "as discussed above , the compactness of draco at a distance of @xmath79kpc , the shape of its radial surface density distribution , and the measured value of its line - of - sight velocity dispersion severely limit the available parameter space for tidal models and make their applicability to draco very unlikely . to fully exclude a tidal model for draco",
    ", one needs to consider its hb . as discussed in section [ subsec : hb - draco ] , the hb of stars in the cmd is remarkably thin with @xmath113mag , and it shows remarkably little variation with extent of the region considered .",
    "values range from @xmath114mag for stars within a radius of @xmath115 around the center of draco to @xmath116mag when considering all hb stars within @xmath117 .",
    "the best - fit tidal model exhibits comparable values only in the innermost region . when considering larger areas , it shows a hb thickness significantly larger than observed .",
    "it is a general property of tidal models to predict a strong correlation between the hb thickness and the angular size of the considered field .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the observational data of draco which reveal no significant variation of hb thickness with area . as illustration , figure",
    "[ fig : hb-4-fields ] shows the cmd obtained for fields of different sizes from model _ 4 _ at time @xmath118gyr when it reaches a distance of @xmath79kpc for the first time after complete disruption .",
    "the corresponding stellar density distribution can be seen in the right column of figure [ fig : compactness ] .",
    "the synthetic cmds are obtained using the method described by klessen & zhao ( 2002 ) with the globular cluster m3 as template , and with @xmath119 computed as in section [ subsec : hb - draco ] .",
    "m3 has metallicities similar to draco and has a very thin hb with @xmath120mag .",
    "hence , any significant hb widening apparent in figure [ fig : hb-4-fields ] stems from stellar distance moduli variations in the projected tidal debris .",
    "the larger the considered area , the larger is the derived hb thickness .",
    "stars that are further away from the projected center of density are likely to be further downstream or upstream along the tidal arms .",
    "the inclusion of those stars into the analysis leads to a larger range of distance moduli and subsequently to a widening of the luminosity distribution in the cmd .    to test the statistical significance of our result we need to address two questions .",
    "first , how does the hb thickness of the best - fit tidal model vary within the evolutionary window allowed from morphological and kinematic considerations ?",
    "second , what is the effect of the small sampling size in the observations  the hb thickness for the innermost region of draco is obtained from only 17 bhb stars ? in the previous section we have demonstrated that the los velocity dispersion in the best - fit tidal model lies within the observed margins only for a period of about @xmath68gyr after complete disruption . furthermore , draco is at a distance of @xmath121kpc .",
    "inspection of the satellite trajectories in figure [ fig : lagrangian ] reveals that model _ 4 _ complies with both requirements only twice , at @xmath118gyr and at @xmath122gyr .",
    "when we allow for a distance uncertainty of draco of 5% , which corresponds in the models to a time span of roughly @xmath123myr , and compare the hb morphology within and between these two intervals , we see that the variations are very small .",
    "this enables us to derive a well - defined and meaningful average hb thickness .",
    "the second question can be addressed by bootstrapping . from the large number of hb stars in the model we randomly select a small subset corresponding in number to the observed sample ( e.g.  17 for the innermost @xmath124 ) and",
    "compute the resulting hb width .",
    "we repeat the procedure @xmath125 times for each field size . the resulting hb thickness @xmath119 together with its standard deviation",
    "averaged over all bootstrapping attempts and averaged over all allowed snapshots of model _ 4 _ is listed in column 5 of table [ tab_width ] for direct comparison with the observations .",
    "the statistical error decreases slightly with increasing field size because of the increasing number of stars considered in the subsamples ( column 4 ) .",
    "the last column in table [ tab_width ] indicates in addition the percentage of the bootstrapping attempts that delivered @xmath126 values in excess of the observations .",
    "this number increases from @xmath127% in the inner @xmath124 to about @xmath128% in the full field , and gives a clear indication that we must consider wide - field data to arrive at statistically sound statements about the nature of dsph galaxies .",
    "it should be noted , that the results still hold , even if no assumption about the intrinsic hb morphology are made , i.e. , even if we assume an intrinsic hb width of zero , @xmath119 in the outer regions would be significantly in excess of the observed values .    in summary , draco has a remarkably thin blue hb showing no signs of variation with radius .",
    "tidal models , however , predict a strong increase of hb thickness with considered field size .",
    "while in the central regions , the hb width in the best - fit tidal model still only marginally exceeds the values observed in draco , this excess is highly significant at larger radii .",
    "the large area coverage offered by sdss is needed to derive this result , and taking all together , we feel save to conclude that even best - fit tidal models which are able to reproduce the morphological parameters of draco can not correctly predict its hb properties .",
    "the dsph galaxies in the vicinity of the milky way are either strongly dark - matter dominated , or they are the remnants of tidally disrupted satellite galaxies and are seen today by terrestrial observers at certain highly favorable viewing angles .",
    "this is inferred from the observed stellar velocity dispersions , which are large with respect to the luminous mass of the galaxy .",
    "a possible third alternative is a modification to newton s law of gravity ( sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) .",
    "it was our attempt in this paper to construct an appropriate tidal model for the draco dsph galaxy .",
    "draco is particularly useful for testing tidal models , because it is one of the best - studied satellite galaxies of our milky way , and its compact and seemingly undistorted morphological appearance as well as its thin hb in the cmd set tight constraints on tidal models .",
    "our effort to find a model for draco that is able to reproduce _ all _ properties of the galaxy known to date failed .",
    "our line of reasoning is the following .",
    "first , we consider the apparent lack of ` extra - tidal ' stars in the vicinity of draco to constrain the orbital trajectory of the progenitor satellite galaxy . indeed ,",
    "tidal models without a noticeable number of ` extra - tidal ' stars are possible if the viewing angle to the galaxy is close to a tangent to the orbital trajectory ( see figure [ fig : trajectory ] ) , which requires that the satellites follow very eccentric orbits .",
    "second , the observed compactness of draco can be reproduced if the satellite galaxy itself initially is small and compact . however",
    ", this galaxy can not be too compact , otherwise it will not be disrupted in the tidal field of the milky way over a hubble time .",
    "third , rapid expansion of the tidal debris after complete disruption limits the period during which the tidal models resemble draco to about @xmath68gyr .",
    "a similar timespan can be derived from looking at the line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",
    "together , these morphological and kinematic constraints severely limit the available parameter space for tidal models , but do not render them completely implausible .",
    "finally , large field - of - view photometric data from the sdss can be used to fully exclude tidal models for draco on the basis of its hb thickness .",
    "the observed small variations in the position of stars in the cmd of draco are inconsistent with the predicted wide distribution in the tidal model due to distance modulus variations along the line of sight .",
    "these models furthermore exhibit a strong increase of hb thickness with increasing field size , while draco exhibits no such variation .",
    "altogether , we conclude that draco _ can not _ be the remnant a tidally disrupted satellite galaxy .",
    "instead , it most likely is strongly dark - matter - dominated as predicted by standard cosmological scenarios and , increasingly , by observational evidence such as structural studies ( e.g. , odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001a ) and the radial dependence of the velocity dispersion ( see kleyna et al .  2001 , 2002 ) .",
