    "nowadays there are several nucleon - nucleon potentials which reproduce experimental information with high precision @xcite . in all of them ,",
    "the long and medium range interactions are associated with the exchanges of one and two pions , whereas there is a wide variation in the way short distance effects are treated .",
    "this region is theoretically uncertain and good fits to the data usually require many free parameters .",
    "the availability of alternative models , although welcome , points out to the need of criteria for discriminating among the various potentials .",
    "all potentials become progressively less reliable as one goes from large to short distances .",
    "the pionic tail of the interaction is quite well established and its only source of uncertainty is the value of the pion - nucleon coupling constant .",
    "it determines many observables of the deuteron and large angular momentum scattering @xcite .",
    "as far as the next layer is concerned , one finds some consensus in the literature regarding the importance of delta intermediate states and pion - pion correlations . nevertheless , the treatment of details of these interactions is not uniform , a fact reflected in the existence of different profile functions for a given component of the potential .",
    "it is in this framework that chiral symmetry may prove to be useful and provide guide - lines for a proper assessment of the various existing potentials .",
    "chiral symmetry corresponds to the idea that strong interactions are approximately invariant under transformations of the group @xmath0 .",
    "this symmetry was developed in the sixties , in the framework of hadron physics , but the reasons behind its successes became clear only after the formulation of qcd , the theory decribing the basic interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "in qcd the quark masses of the low - lying @xmath1 multiplet are very small and the lagrangian becomes chiral invariant when they are neglected .",
    "qcd predictions can be directly tested only at high energies , where perturbation makes sense . at low energies , on the other hand",
    ", its non - abelian structure makes calculations very difficult , and one is forced to resort to effective hadronic theories . in order to remain as close as possible to the fundamental level , the hadronic lagrangian must have the same symmetries as qcd , even the approximate ones , such as chiral symmetry .",
    "one of the major successes of chiral symmetry at hadron level were the predictions made for low - energy @xmath2n scattering .",
    "early chiral calculations of this process considered just minimal systems , containing only pions and nucleons @xcite . motivated by phenomenology , this model was extended and one has learned that chiral amplitudes at tree level , including nucleon and delta poles , rho exchanges and corrections associated with @xmath2n sigma term do reproduce satisfactorily subthreshold and scattering data up to 300 mev .",
    "chiral symmetry at hadron level may be implemented by means of either linear or non - linear lagrangians .",
    "the fact that no serious candidate has been found for the @xmath3 meson favours the latter type of approach .",
    "there are two forms of non - linear lagrangians which are especially suited for the @xmath2n system .",
    "one of them is based on a pseudoscalar ( ps ) @xmath2n coupling supplemented by a scalar ( s ) interaction , equivalent to the exchange of an infinitely massive @xmath3 meson , and denoted as @xmath4 scheme ( eq .  [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "the other one employs a pseudovector ( pv ) @xmath2n interaction and a vector ( v ) term , which could represent the exchange of an infinitely massive @xmath5 meson , constituting the @xmath6 scheme ( eq .  [ eq.2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8    both approaches yield the very same amplitude for the @xmath2n scattering when the axial coupling constant @xmath9 is equal to 1 .",
    "the extention to the case @xmath10 can be done quite naturally in the @xmath6 approach , and a little less so in the @xmath4 case .",
    "the fact that physical results should be independent of the representation used to implement chiral symmetry was discussed in very general terms by coleman , wess , and zumino @xcite . in the case of @xmath2n interactions ,",
    "this point was emphasized by coon and friar @xcite .",
    "chiral symmetry has very little to say about the one pion exchange nn potential since , in the @xmath4 approach , predictions for this component do not depend on the scalar interaction .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 and @xmath12 couplings are equivalent .",
    "the intermediate range part of the interaction , on the other hand , is due to the exchange of two pions and closely related to an off - shell @xmath2n amplitude .",
    "thus , as pointed out by brown and durso in 1971 @xcite , chiral symmetry is quite relevant in this region . in the first calculations of this component of the potential , chiral symmetry",
    "was included disguised in the form of soft - pion theorems @xcite .",
    "nowadays one has realized that the use of effective field theories makes the implementation of chiral symmetry into hadronic systems much easier .    in the early seventies , approaches to the intermediate range nn interactions based on field theory disconsidered chiral symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , they were very important in setting the method to tackle the problem . in 1970 ,",
    "partovi and lomon @xcite performed a paradigmatic calculation based on feynman diagrams , using just @xmath11 couplings without chiral counterterms .",
    "a little later , partovi and lomon @xcite included the @xmath3 meson in their calculation , used chiral symmetry to determine the @xmath3n coupling constant , but did not group diagrams into chiral families , producing a potential with an uneven number of loops .",
    "about ten years later a rather comprehensive study was performed by zuilhof and tjon @xcite , who compared direct and crossed box diagrams obtained using both ps and pv couplings , without paying attention to chiral symmetry .",
    "the first modern field theoretical calculation of the two - pion exchange nucleon - nucleon potential ( @xmath13e - nnp ) with strong emphasis on chiral symmetry was produced by ordez and van kolck @xcite .",
    "they applied the conceptual pertubative framework developed by weinberg @xcite in a systematic discussion of corrections to pure ope interactions , associated with form factor effects , exchange of two pions , and three body forces .",
    "the problem was formulated using @xmath12 coupling for the pion , and expressions were given in momentum space .    in 1992 ,",
    "celenza , pantziris and shakin @xcite studied the influence of chiral symmetry on the nn interaction at one - loop order .",
    "these authors considered both @xmath11 and @xmath12 pion - nucleon couplings in order to derive the qualitative features of the scalar - isoscalar component of the interaction .",
    "they employed tensor decompositions of diagrams in momentum space , and one of their main conclusions was that the irreducible isoscalar interaction is attractive .    in a series of independent works",
    ", other authors also addressed to the same problem , namely the determination of the role of chiral symmetry in the two - pion exchange nn interaction .",
    "a momentum space evaluation of the scalar - isoscalar component was produced by birse @xcite , in the framework of the linear @xmath3-model .",
    "friar and coon @xcite , used a more general lagrangian in order to obtain a momentum space potential for infinitely massive nucleons .",
    "finally , in another calculation , we @xcite used non - linear lagrangians based on covariant derivatives and obtained a non - relativistic potential in coordinate space .",
    "all these calculations @xcite are based on chiral symmetry and should , in spite of technical differences , yield the same predictions for the two - pion exchange potential .",
    "however , inspection of the conclusions presented by the various authors shows that this is not the case .",
    "discrepancies may be traced back to two different sources , namely the methods employed for regularizing divergent integrals and the procedures used to subtract the iterated opep .",
    "we here consider only the latter problem .",
    "it is well known that the meaning of an iteration is defined by the dynamical equation adopted in a given problem .",
    "thus , the use of the relativistic bethe - salpeter equation @xcite or the non - relativistic reductions due to brueckner and watson @xcite or blankenbecler - sugar @xcite correspond to different forms for the potential . an explicit discussion of the non - relativistic case can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that physics is independent of the particular approach employed .    another important feature of the problem is that physical results in a consistent calculation should also not depend the particular representation used in the implementation of chiral symmetry @xcite . in our calculation @xcite , we have shown explicitly that both @xmath4 and @xmath6 lagrangians correspond to the same non - relativistic potential .",
    "of course , there is no reason to expect that things would be different in the case of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "however , we believe that the explicit demonstration of this property in the relativistic framework may prove to be non - trivial .",
    "the basic idea of the bethe - salpeter equation is to decompose the full amplitude into two - particle propagators and irreducible kernels . in the @xmath4 case",
    ", this kind of decomposition poses no special problem .",
    "the @xmath6 case , on the other hand , is tricky , since its box diagram contains contributions in which the pole of the nucleon propagator is canceled and hence must be interpreted with great care .",
    "cancellations of nucleon poles are , in fact , already present in the intermediate @xmath2n amplitude that determines the @xmath13e - nnp @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present state of the art , we believe that non - relativistic potentials provide a much safer ground for the study of chiral symmetry .",
    "the minimal chiral model for the @xmath13e - nnp , involving only pions and nucleons , has nowadays very solid conceptual foundations .",
    "it has attained the same status as the opep in the late sixties and one may expect it to become a necessary ingredient of any modern nn potential . on the other hand",
    ", this minimal chiral model fails to reproduce experimental information in the case of the intermediate @xmath2n amplitude incorporated into the nn interaction .",
    "thus , in the @xmath13e - nnp , the minimal model corresponds to a contribution which is necessary , but not sufficient to describe reality .",
    "this requirement demands the inclusion of other fields and processes in the model .",
    "an extension , in the framework of chiral symmetry , has been recently considered by ordez , ray and van kolck @xcite , with promissing results .    in all calculations of the chiral background to the @xmath13e - nnp",
    ", results are given in form of cumbersome integrals , which must be evaluated numerically . in order to facilitate applications , in sec .",
    "ii of this work we present a parametrized version of our configuration space potential , valid up to 0.5 fm and completely free of cut off parameters .",
    "the knowledge of the minimal chiral @xmath13e - nnp may be used to assess the phenomenological content of a given potential .",
    "this information can be obtained by subtracting the opep from it and then comparing the remainder with the chiral two pion exchange background . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the dtrs @xcite , paris @xcite , and argonne @xcite potentials in order to produce an instance of this kind of study .",
    "our calculation of the @xmath13e - nnp is based on the blankenbecler - sugar reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation . in the @xmath4 scheme ,",
    "its dynamical content is associated with the five diagrams displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "therefore we label the corresponding individual contributions by @xmath14 , where the last one also includes the subtraction of the iterated opep .",
    "it has the general form    @xmath15 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left(3 + 2 \\bbox{\\tau}^{(1)}\\cdot \\bbox{\\tau}^{(2)}\\right ) \\left[v^c_{\\join}+\\hat{o}_{ss } v^{ss}_{\\join}+\\hat{o}_{ls } v^{ls}_{\\join } + \\hat{o}_t v^{t}_{\\join}\\right ] + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left(3 - 2\\bbox{\\tau}^{(1)}\\cdot\\bbox{\\tau}^{(2)}\\right ) \\left[v_\\box^c+\\hat{o}_{ss}v_\\box^{ss}+\\hat{o}_{ls}v_\\box^{ls}+\\hat{o}_t v_\\box^t\\right ] \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the spin operators are given by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , whereas @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent spin and isospin matrices for nucleon @xmath21 .    in the case of the bubble diagram",
    ", the leading contribution to the asymptotic potential can be calculated analytically , as shown in appendix .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , one may expect a realistic two - pion exchange nucleon - nucleon potential to be composed of a minimal chiral background supplemented by other terms determined by phenomenology . in this section",
