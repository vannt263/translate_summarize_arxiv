    "the problem which we will be dealt with in this note is known as `` the three color problem '' .",
    "clearly the central problem is the four coloring of planar graphs .",
    "ruling out the almost trivial two coloring of bipartite graphs the transition from three coloring to four coloring with respect to graphical property e.g. , planarity and non - planarity , cycle sizes , cycles through fix number of vertices , connectivity ( disjoint paths between two vertices ) of the graph is not very sharp .",
    "but there is an old attempt of heawood for three - color criterion of triangulated planar graphs which has been strengthened in this paper as well as in [ 1 ] .",
    "let us briefly list the previous results on the three coloring of planar graphs .",
    "apparently the first 3-color criterion for planar graphs was given by heawood in 1898 and is known as the three color theorem `` ; simply saying that a finite triangulation is 3-colorable if and only if it is even [ 1 ] .",
    "one may expect that after the proof of four color theorem [ 2],[3 ] in 1976 and another earlier result due to grtzsch saying that all planar graphs without 3-cycles are three colorable ''  [ 4 ] leads that all coloring problems related with the planar graphs should be easily derived from these results .",
    "but steinberg s three colorability conjecture for planar graphs without 4 and 5 cycles tell us the opposite .",
    "erds [ 5 ] suggested an simpler question by asking whether there exits a constant c such that the absence of cycles with size from 4 to c in a planar graph guarantees its 3-colorability ? in response to this question",
    "first abbott and zhou [ 6 ] proved that such a c exists and c@xmath311 .",
    "then borodin improved it first to 10 and then to c@xmath39 [ 7],[8 ] .",
    "independently sanders and zhao have obtained the same upper bound [ 9 ] .",
    "very recently borodin et .",
    "reduce the upper - bound to 7 by showing that [ 10 ] :    every planar graph without cycles of length 4 to 7 is 3-colorable .",
    "in fact they showed a little stronger result :    every proper 3-coloring of the vertices of any face of size from 8 to 11 in a connected graph g@xmath4 can be extended to a proper 3-coloring of the whole graph .    in theorem 2 , g@xmath4",
    "denote the class of planar graphs without cycles of size from 4 to 7 .",
    "most of these results on this conjecture are based on the discharging method which was first used in the proof of the four - color theorem .",
    "similarly let us denote by g@xmath5 , the class of planar graphs without cycles of size from 4 to 6 .",
    "on the other hand in [ 11 ] a new 3-color criterion has been given for planar graphs :    ( 3-color criteria ) .",
    "let g be a ( biconnected ) plane graph .",
    "the following three conditions are equivalent :    \\(i ) g is 3-colorable .",
    "\\(ii ) there exists an even triangulation h@xmath6 g .",
    "\\(iii ) g is edge - side colorable .",
    "our method is not rely on the previous results or necessary conditions of @xmath2 colorability of planar graphs .",
    "in fact we have given a coloring algorithm which color vertices of any planar graph in @xmath7 let us assume that the @xmath8 has been embedded in the plane without edge crossing . since the graph g@xmath5 has no cycle of length four and five this implies that it has also no subgraph such as two triangles with a common edge .",
    "let @xmath9 be the three colors , say green , yellow , and red .",
    "let us define spiral - chains in @xmath10 which is exactly same as in [ 12],[13 ] .",
    "that we select any vertex on the outer - cycle of @xmath10 and scan outer leftmost vertices in the clockwise ( or counter clockwise ) direction and bypassing a vertex that is already scanned . if the last scanned vertex is adjacent only previously scanned vertices then we select closest vertex to the last scanned vertex and begin for a new spiral - chain till all vertices scanned . this way we have obtained the set of vertex disjoint spiral chains @xmath11 of @xmath10 .",
    "note that if @xmath12 then @xmath13 is also an hamilton path of @xmath10 .",
    "coloring of the vertices in @xmath11 are carried out in the reverse order of the spiral chains and vertices i.e. , @xmath14 a very simple spiral - chain coloring algorithm is given below which is similar the one given for edge coloring of cubic planar graphs in [ 13 ] but here we do not need kempe switching .",
    "then color respectively the vertices of @xmath16 using smaller indexed colors whenever possible , that is @xmath17 ( green ) is in general the most frequent and @xmath18 ( red ) is the least frequent color used in the algorithm .",
    "note that while coloring the vertices of spiral chain @xmath19 if vertices @xmath20 and @xmath21 of an edge @xmath22 is also belongs to a triangle and has been colored , say with @xmath17 and @xmath23 then the other vertex @xmath24 of the triangle will get the color @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath24 has already been colored , say by @xmath23 then @xmath20 is colored by @xmath17 and @xmath21 is colored by @xmath18 .        by the ordering of spiral",
    "- chains that if @xmath25 then vertices of @xmath26 are colored before the vertices of @xmath27 and also if @xmath28 and @xmath29 then the vertex @xmath30 is colored before @xmath31 .",
    "worst case configuration ( a subgraph ) in @xmath10 is a cycle of length six with triangles attached to its edges is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the first spiral chain @xmath13 passing through the three vertices forces all other four spiral chains @xmath32 ordered in the clockwise direction .",
    "now the spiral - coloring starts from @xmath33 and go to @xmath13without needing the forth color as follows :    @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that because of six triangles we have to use the color `` red '' six times but this is not the case for a less complicated configuration i.e. , with less number of triangles , which can be obtained from this one by only deleting  vertices colored red .",
    "consider three disjoint triangles @xmath37 and @xmath38 and three spiral chains @xmath39 respectively passing through the edges @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a vertex such that @xmath42 without loss of generality assume that @xmath43 that is @xmath44 is coming after @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we will show that vertices @xmath47 can not have three different colors but only @xmath18 by the spiral chain coloring .",
    "assume contrary that the vertices @xmath48 have the following coloring :          but by the coloring rule of the algorithm ( piority of the colors in the assignment ) @xmath47 are forced to be colored by @xmath52 so we can start coloring the first vertex @xmath53 of @xmath45 with @xmath54 .",
    "lastly its easy to see that no any vertex of @xmath10 are left not colored .        in figure 1",
    "we illustrate our spiral - chain three coloring for a graph with 19 vertices in g@xmath5 .",
    "( a ) first we select arbitrarily a vertex from the outer - cycle of the graph and starting from that vertex and traversing the vertices in clockwise direction ( always select not yet scanned outer - leftmost vertex ) in the form of a spiral chain .",
    "hence the spiral - chain @xmath13 with vertex set @xmath57 .",
    "since the last vertex @xmath58 is only adjacent to a vertex of @xmath13 we start new spiral chain @xmath59 from the closest unscanned adjacent vertex ( in the graph vertex @xmath60 ) to @xmath58 .",
    "similarly we have obtained the second spiral chain @xmath59 with the vertex set @xmath61 .",
    "since the other edges connected to @xmath62 have adjacent to already scanned spiral chain @xmath13 vertices ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) we start a new spiral - chain @xmath65closest unscanned vertex which is a isolated vertex @xmath66 .",
    "( b ) second part of the algorithm is the three - coloring of the vertices of the spiral - chains @xmath67 in reveres order . colors @xmath17",
    "( green),@xmath23 ( yellow ) and @xmath18 ( red ) have been denoted by the numbers @xmath68 and @xmath2 .",
    "note that in the spiral - chain coloring algorithm the color `` green '' has a pioroty over `` yellow '' and `` red '' colors and the color yellow has a piority over the red color .",
    "color the vertex in @xmath66 with @xmath69 and since @xmath70 is a triangle we also color @xmath71 .",
    "color the vertices of @xmath72 as @xmath73 . since @xmath74 is a triangle we also color @xmath75 similarly since @xmath76 is a triangle we color @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "finally color the vertices of @xmath79 as @xmath80 , since @xmath81 is a triangle color also @xmath82since @xmath83 and @xmath84 have been already colored with @xmath23 and @xmath18 we continiue coloring @xmath85 and since @xmath64 and @xmath63 have been colored before with @xmath23 and @xmath18 we color @xmath86since @xmath87 and @xmath88 are colored before with @xmath89 and @xmath23 we color @xmath90 and @xmath91 ."
