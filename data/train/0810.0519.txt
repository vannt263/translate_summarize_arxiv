    "<S> channelization is a key characteristic of flow and transport in fractured rocks  ( @xcite ) and results frequently from the occurence of relative shear displacements of the two fracture surfaces during fracturation  ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> such displacements ( named @xmath0 thereafter ) have been shown both experimentally and numerically  ( @xcite ) to create channels and ridges perpendicular to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> their length depends on the multiscale geometry of the fracture walls and , even for small amplitudes @xmath10 , may be a significant fraction of the fracture size . </S>",
    "<S> the permeability is then anisotropic : both its value and the correlation length of the velocity field are higher for a mean flow parallel to these channels ( _ i.e. _ perpendicular to @xmath0 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the objective of this communication is to demonstrate experimentally that this type of channelization also induces a strong anisotropy of the magnitude and properties of tracer dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by comparing dispersion for mean flows parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the channels , but with identical flow parameters and geometry otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> a previous work  ( @xcite ) studied dispersion in one similar model ( with a lower value of @xmath10 ) but with the different objective of analyzing the influence of the fluid rheology . here </S>",
    "<S> , the dynamics of the process , _ i.e. _ the variation with distance of the geometry and thickness of the mixing front is more specifically compared in the parallel and perpendicular configurations .    many experiments on solute spreading in fractures have been reported : @xcite observed dispersion coefficients @xmath11 increasing linearly with the mean flow velocity @xmath12 ( _ i.e. _ the dispersivity @xmath13 is constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , these measurements were all realized at the outlet of the sample with no information on the development of the mixing front with distance . </S>",
    "<S> measurements by  @xcite used radioactive tracers , still with a resolution too low to investigate local spreading . </S>",
    "<S> in all these papers , the anisotropy of dispersion is not investigated and ( except for @xcite ) little information is available on the relative position of the fracture walls .    </S>",
    "<S> we use transparent model fractures allowing for high resolution optical concentration measurements over their full area . </S>",
    "<S> the models are mounted vertically between a light panel and a @xmath14 bits roper digital camera . </S>",
    "<S> fluid flow takes place between two self - affine rectangular rough walls of same characteristic exponent @xmath15 as in many fractured rocks  ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mean flow velocity @xmath3 is parallel to the length @xmath16 of the walls ( their width is @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two walls are complementary and identical in the two models and they match perfectly when put in contact ; then , they are pulled away normal to their mean surface and a lateral shear @xmath0 , parallel or perpendicular to @xmath3 ( _ i.e. _ to @xmath18 ) is introduced . in these two configurations , referred to as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the mean velocity @xmath3 is therefore respectively perpendicular and parallel to the channels created by the shear . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath10 and the mean aperture @xmath19 are equal to @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the standard deviation of the aperture @xmath21 is larger than for the similar models of @xcite ( @xmath22 ) : as a result , the flow field is found to be more strongly channelized .    </S>",
    "<S> the fluids are shear thinning @xmath23 solutions of scleroglucan in water with a high constant viscosity ( @xmath24 ) at low shear rates @xmath25 preventing the appearance of unwanted buoyancy driven flows  ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> one has @xmath26 : for a viscous newtonian flow between parallel plates at a distance @xmath19 , the corresponding mean velocity is @xmath27 . at shear rates @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> , the viscosity decreases as @xmath29 with @xmath30 ( see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the fluids contains @xmath31 of blue dye and the densities are matched by adding nacl to the other . </S>",
    "<S> the flow velocity @xmath12 is constant during each experiment with : @xmath32 and tracer transport is characterized by the dimensionless pclet number @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the dye . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental procedure and the determination of dye concentration maps from images recorded at constant time intervals are described by  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : map]b and [ fig : map]d reflect velocity contrasts between the channels created by the shear . </S>",
    "<S> they are well reproduced by modelling the fracture aperture field as a set of independent parallel channels of aperture @xmath35  ( @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> the profile @xmath41 of the front at a time @xmath42 is then : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are averages calculated over @xmath36 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : xfront ] ) and the actual aperture fields appear in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : map]a and [ fig : map]b ) and @xmath30 at the highest one ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : map]c and [ fig : map]d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : xfront ] ) predicts well the location and shape of the `` fingers '' and `` troughs '' at both velocities for @xmath2 although their amplitude is slightly underestimated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : map]b . in this latter case </S>",
    "<S> , one has @xmath46 , corresponding to a transition regime between the power law and newtonian rheologies .    </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that , for @xmath2 ( _ i.e. _ if @xmath3 is parallel to the channels created by the shear ) , the large scale features of solute transport are determined by the contrasts between the velocities in these channels which increase with their aperture . </S>",
    "<S> then , front spreading is purely convective and the total width @xmath47 of the front parallel to @xmath3 ( _ i.e. _ the distance between the tips of the fingers and the bottom of the troughs ) increases linearly with distance as @xmath48 ( @xmath49 = typical relative velocity contrast between the different channels ) . </S>",
    "<S> these curves also demonstrate that the difference between the sizes of the fingers in the two cases are accounted for by the different rheological behavior of the fluids : the velocity contrasts ( and therefore the size ) are amplified for @xmath50 ( shear - thinning power law domain ) compared to the vicinity of the newtonian constant viscosity regime ( @xmath51 ) .    for @xmath1 , the features of the front are also visible at the same transverse distances @xmath36 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : map]a and [ fig : map]c : they reflect again a convective spreading of the front due to velocity contrasts between the flow paths . </S>",
    "<S> however , in contrast with the previous case @xmath2 , these features ( except for the small global slope of the front ) are not reproduced by the theoretical model ( dotted line ) : this was to be expected since its underlying hypothesis are not satisfied for @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the time variations of the local concentration @xmath52 on individual pixels complement the above study by providing quantitative information on the interplay of convective and diffusive mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> for all the experiments , @xmath52 is found to be well fitted by solutions of a classical @xmath53 convection - dispersion equation for a step - like initial variation of @xmath54 at the inlet ( @xmath55 ) : @xmath56 here , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the mean transit time and apparent dispersion coefficient deduced from the time variation of the relative concentration @xmath52 of the displaced fluid at point @xmath59 ( transverse dispersion is neglected here ) . </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown below that the two parameters provide complementary information : @xmath58 ( or rather the dispersivity @xmath60 ) characterizes the local thickness of the mixing front while @xmath57 is related to its global geometry .    for each experiment , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 and @xmath58 are determined for all pixels inside the field of view . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : distrit ] compares experimental and theoretical probability distributions of the normalized times @xmath61 for the same experiments as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : map ] . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical distribution is obtained by taking @xmath62 , computing the ratio @xmath63 by means of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : xfront ] ) for all @xmath36 values and determining finally the distribution of the results . as expected , the distributions are much broader for @xmath2 ( figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : distrit]b - d ) than for @xmath1 ( figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : distrit]a - c ) . for @xmath50 , the experimental distribution for flow parallel to the channels </S>",
    "<S> coincides very well with the theoretical one and displays two peaks reflecting the structuration of the flow . at @xmath51 , the width and global shape of the experimental and theoretical distributions </S>",
    "<S> are overall similar and narrower than for @xmath50 due to the lower velocity contrast in the newtonian limit . for @xmath1 ( figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : distrit]a - c ) , the distribution at both pclet numbers is much narrower than for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean peak corresponds to @xmath64 ; its width increases with @xmath9 ( again likely due to an increase of the velocity contrasts ) and is similar to that of the theoretical distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental distribution displays however additional `` aisles '' : these reflect likely complex paths deviating from straight trajectories parallel to @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> while , from the above results , the overall geometry of the mixing front seems to be determined mainly by convective effects , we examine now the relative influence of convection and diffusion on the local width of this front : this may be characterized by the variation of the local dispersivity @xmath5 with @xmath9 . figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : histold]a - b display , for each value of @xmath18 ( horizontal scale ) , the histogram ( coded in grey levels ) of the corresponding values of @xmath65 ( vertical scale ) .    for @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution of @xmath65 is narrow , particularly at high flow velocities ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : histold]a and c ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the mean value varies little with the distance @xmath18 and reaches a constant value @xmath66 for @xmath67 ( see inset of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : ldvsx ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the increase with time of the local front thickness is therefore diffusive and can be characterized by a single dispersivity value @xmath66 .    for @xmath2 ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : histold]b and d ) , the distribution of the values of @xmath68 is much broader and displays a `` tail '' at large values of @xmath68 . at the two highest velocities , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution displays two peaks ( solid curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : histold ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the value of @xmath69 corresponding to the peak(s ) seems to reach a limit at long distances @xmath18 , the global width of the distribution keeps increasing with @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case @xmath1 , the increase of the local thickness of the mixing front with @xmath18 is not simply diffusive and can not be characterized by a single dispersivity parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the variation of @xmath70 with @xmath9 for @xmath1 displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ldvsx ] provides quantitative information on the local dispersion mechanisms : the values are similar ( although slightly higher ) to the predictions for taylor dispersion with a power law fluid ( continuous line ) . at low @xmath9 s , </S>",
    "<S> the values obtained for @xmath39 ( dashed line ) and for @xmath30 are similar and the transition towards a newtonian behaviour should not influence the variations . a dominant contribution of taylor dispersion has already been demonstrated in models with a randomly distributed aperture of short correlation length  ( @xcite ) ; however , at low @xmath9 s , an additional geometrical dispersion regime ( @xmath71 ) was observed and is not present here .    in the opposite case ( @xmath2 ) , </S>",
    "<S> no single value of @xmath72 characterizes dispersion in the whole model . </S>",
    "<S> however , the first peak in the distribution of @xmath72 likely reflects dispersion in regions of low transverse gradient of the mean front velocity in the plane of the model : there , additional spreading due to transverse diffusion in the velocity gradient should be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath68 corresponding to this first peak have therefore been plotted in fig  [ fig : ldvsx ] ( @xmath73 ) as a function of @xmath9 . at high velocities , they are indeed close to those corresponding to taylor dispersion ( and to the other model ) ; at low velocities , they remain higher .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , the present experiments demonstrate that solute dispersion in a channelized rough fracture depends crucially of the orientation of the flow . </S>",
    "<S> optical measurements allowed us to characterize the dynamics of dispersion at both the global and local scales from mean transit times and local dispersivities deduced from local concentration variations .    for @xmath2 ( @xmath3 parallel to the channelization ) , </S>",
    "<S> the large scale geometry of the displacement front is controlled by the velocity contrasts between the channels . at all @xmath9 values ( @xmath74 ) </S>",
    "<S> the geometries of the large fingers and troughs in the front and the distribution of the local transit times @xmath61 are well predicted from a transverse effective permeability profile computed using the aperture field . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , differences between the finger sizes at low and high @xmath9 s are explained by variations of the fluid rheology ( shear - thinning at high pe s and newtonian at low ones ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm fully the convective origin of the large scale structures of the front and the relevance of local measurements all along the flow paths : measuring only variations of the mean concentration at the outlet ( as is often done practically ) and fitting it to a solution of a convection - diffusion equation might indeed lead to an incorrect identification of such processes as geometrical dispersion .    for @xmath1 ( </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 perpendicular to the channelization ) , the front is flatter and the distribution of the transit times is narrower than for @xmath2 ; this reflects a more effective sampling of the velocity heterogeneities by the solute particles . as could be expected , </S>",
    "<S> the remaining geometrical features of the front can not be predicted by the channel model : however they are still observed at the same transverse locations at all velocities and remain of similar amplitudes ( taking into account the variations of the rheology ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that these features are again of convective origin .    </S>",
    "<S> still for @xmath1 , the variation of the local front thickness is diffusive and well characterized by a single mean dispersivity @xmath70 ; its dependence on @xmath9 suggests a dominant influence of taylor dispersion . for @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the broad distribution of @xmath5 does not allow one to define a meaningful global dispersivity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , even the lowest values of @xmath5 ( corresponding to simple flow paths ) are larger than those expected for taylor dispersion except at the highest @xmath9 values ; values corresponding to taylor dispersion are also expected at smaller values of @xmath10 leading to a reduced disorder of the flow field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this latter difference , as well as the tail in the distribution , reflect the increasing influence of transverse molecular diffusion inducing tracer exchange with adjacent flow paths of different velocities and enhancing dispersion .    </S>",
    "<S> this set of results is highly relevant to the interpretation of field observations  ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the influence of the length of the samples is an important issue and will need to be investigated before transposing these results . in particular , although the front geometries are determined in both configurations by spatial variations of the flow velocities , a geometrical dispersion regime has never been observed , in contrast with experiments on rough fractures with a small correlation length of the aperture  ( @xcite ) . for much longer fractures , </S>",
    "<S> transverse diffusion might be large enough for solute particles to sample the whole distribution of local velocities and reach such a global diffusive spreading regime . in the case of a broad distribution of the hydraulic conductivities </S>",
    "<S> , one might also observe instead an anomalous dispersion regime as suggested by  @xcite and @xcite . because of the specific correlations of the flow velocity field for self - affine wall geometries  ( @xcite ) , the corresponding exponent would then likely depend on the characteristic roughness exponent of the fracture walls . </S>"
