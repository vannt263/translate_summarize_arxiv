    "over the last two decades , observations of dwarf galaxies have challenged in a variety of ways our understanding of the mapping from dark matter halos to their baryonic components ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one of the dwarf galaxy puzzles that has emerged both in the field and in the galactic environment is basically a structural mismatch .",
    "dark matter - only simulations predict steep (  cuspy \" ) inner density profiles , but the observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies show the sign of a near - constant density core @xcite .",
    "while this may indicate the need for more complex physics in the dark sector itself , emerging evidence suggests that a poor understanding of the baryonic processes involved in galaxy formation may be at the origin of this dwarf  core - cusp problem \" .",
    "rapid mass loss driven by supernovae ( sne ) has long been argued to reduce the baryonic content of luminous dwarfs @xcite and flatten their central dm cusps @xcite .",
    "a new generation of hydrodynamic simulations , with sufficient resolution to model clustered star formation and the impact of sn - driven winds on the central mass distribution of dwarfs @xcite , together with analytic modeling @xcite , have shown that gravitational potential fluctuations tied to efficient sn feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in the most massive dwarfs .",
    "it remains unclear , however , whether this solution may work in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the local group , which are quite deficient in stars and subject to structure - changing ram pressure stripping and tidal heating by the host halo and disk @xcite .",
    "moreover , the core - cusp problem and the  missing satellite \" problem @xcite ) appear to place conflicting demands on the mass - to - light ratios of dwarfs , as core formation requires a relatively efficient conversion of gas into stars , while solving the abundance mismatch of cdm requires the opposite @xcite .        to shed light on these controversies",
    ", we have recently run a fully cosmological @xmath0cdm simulation of a group of seven field dwarf galaxies with present - day virial masses in the range @xmath5 @xcite . our simulation ",
    "one of the highest resolution  zoom - ins \" of field dwarfs run to redshift 0  was performed with the parallel treesph code gasoline @xcite using approximately 6 million dark matter and an equal number of sph particles . the gravitational spline softening length for collisional and collisionless particles",
    "was fixed to @xmath6 pc ( physical ) . in high - density regions",
    "the gas smoothing length was allowed to shrink to @xmath7 to ensure that hydrodynamic forces are resolved on tens of parsecs scales .",
    "the simulation includes a star formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold , metal - dependent radiative cooling , a sub - grid scheme for the turbulent diffusion of thermal energy and metals , and a spatially uniform photoionizing uv background . to generate large - scale galactic outflows",
    ", we used the  delayed radiative cooling \" scheme of @xcite .",
    "the modeling of recurring sne by the sedov solution is best interpreted as a simplified algorithm to mimic the effect of energy deposited in the local ism by multiple , clustered sources of mechanical luminosity .",
    "the importance of properly accounting for the entire momentum and energy budget of stellar feedback , including momentum injection by radiation pressure and stellar winds from massive stars , has been recently stressed by many authors ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite have shown , in particular , that simulations with maximal momentum injection suppress star formation to a similar degree as found in simulations that , like ours , adopt adiabatic thermal feedback .",

    "they are characterized by blue colors , low star formation efficiencies , and high cold gas to stellar mass ratios @xcite .",
    "their inner 2 kpc density profiles are resolved with as many as @xmath38 dm particles ( bashful ) and as few as @xmath39 ( grumpy ) , and their maximum circular velocities bracket the interval @xmath40 .",
    "the two most massive dwarfs , bashful and doc , are within 100 kpc of each other and form an isolated dwarf - dwarf galaxy pair like those found in the sloan digital sky survey by @xcite .",

    "this empirically - motivated analytical function has proven to be a better description of both the shape of the rotation curve and the central densities of nearby dwarf galaxies than an nfw halo @xcite , and to work well in the simulations of @xcite . as can be seen from figure [ fig1 ] ,",
    "this is also true for our simulated dwarfs , for which a pseudo - isothermal fit is remarkably good within the central 5 kpc . at the present epoch ,",
    "we measure core radii of 1.8 and 2.1 kpc in doc and bashful , respectively .",
    "a marginally - resolved core of @xmath45 kpc is also seen in grumpy .",
    "note that mass models for nearby low surface brightness galaxies yield core radii that are often @xmath46 kpc @xcite .",
    "the figure also shows the cuspy density profiles obtained in a _",
    "control dm - only simulation_. at the end of the hydrodynamic simulation , the dark matter density at the smallest resolved radius in bashful ( doc ) is 6 ( 14 ) times as small as the density obtained in the dm - only run .",
    "the offset between the inner ( within 2 kpc ) dm mass in the hydrodynamic ( cored ) and collisionless ( cuspy ) simulations , @xmath47 , is @xmath48 and @xmath49 for bashful , doc , and grumpy , respectively .",
    "these mass deficits imply an ejected dm mass per stellar mass  the _ dm core mass removal efficiency _",

    "the central densities of simulated halos can be artificially low due to two - body relaxation when the number of particles is low .",
    "here we have conservatively applied the @xcite criterion to our dm - only runs to estimate the radius within which the two - body relaxation time is shorter than the hubble time .",
    "we find convergence radii for our dwarfs between 300 and 350 pc at redshift 0 , and close to 200 pc at redshift 1 .",
    "no core is observed today in dopey : in this very faint dwarf ( @xmath51 ) the best - fit core radius is smaller than the numerical convergence radius and for this reason we do not report the parameters of the pseudo - isothermal halo fit in table [ tab:7dwarfs ] .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the dm density profiles in the two most luminous dwarfs , bashful and doc , at redshifts 1 and 2 , as measured in the hydrodynamic run and in the control collisionless simulation .",
    "grumpy was not included in the figure as it starts forming stars rather late , at @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "large cores are already in place at high redshift : the unbinding of the cusp starts early , when the host is significantly less massive than today ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the formation of _ early cores _ must be a generic feature of dwarf galaxies in the real universe .",
    "the cumulative star formation histories of bashful and doc have been shown in @xcite to be consistent with those inferred for dwarfs in the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury program ( angst ) sample @xcite and based on color - magnitude diagrams of resolved stellar populations .",
    "the typical angst dwarf forms the bulk of its stars prior to redshift 1 and exhibits dominant ancient star formation ( @xmath53 10 gyr ago ) and lower levels of activity at intermediate times ( 110 gyr ago ) .",
    "this simple fact underscores the danger of non - cosmological idealized calculations of the cusp - core transformation , where all the sn energy is assumed to be released in the deeper gravitational potential of the dwarf descendant halo , rather than in the shallower well of an early progenitor .    to shed more light on the energetics and timetable of the creation of cores in dwarf galaxies , we plot in the top panels of figure [ fig3 ] the evolution with lookback time and stellar mass of the best - fit core radius @xmath44 in both bashful and doc .",
    "cores on scales that are well resolved by our simulation form when @xmath54 a few @xmath55 .",
    "core radii grow rapidly to kpc - size before redshift 2 , and then oscillate around a value that increases slowly for 10 gyr .",
    "the four vertical marks in the top left panel indicate the location of the most recent major ( @xmath531:10 ) mergers of bashful : cores appear to be resilient and cusps are not _ restored _ following galaxy mergers .",
    "the left middle panel depicts the total energy , @xmath56 , injected by type ii sne as a function of time .",
    "@xcite used the virial theorem to estimate the minimum energy required for the cusp - core transformation as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the gravitational binding energy of the dm halo , @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the total enclosed mass , and we have computed @xmath61 and @xmath62 from the hydrodynamical and dm - only simulations , respectively . in the simulated dwarfs , @xmath63 at all times . at redshift 2 , when the stellar masses of bashful and doc are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and their virial masses are 3.4 times and 2.2 times smaller than today , a pseudo - isothermal fit to their dm profiles yields core sizes of 1.3 kpc and 0.8 kpc , respectively . for reference ,",
    "we measure at this epoch @xmath66 in bashful and @xmath67 in doc . at later times , @xmath68 , while the host mass continues to grow , the  scouring \" of the _ pre - existing _",
    "core by sn feedback progresses as dm particles are lifted from a potential that is significantly shallower than predicted by collisionless simulations ( middle right panel in the figure ) .",
    "our dwarfs have bursty star formation histories that are characterized by peak specific star formation rates in excess of 50100 gyr@xmath69 , far outside the realm of normal , more massive galaxies .",
    "the bottom left panel of figure [ fig3 ] shows the baryon mass interior to 0.5 and 1 kpc as a function of lookback time , with a fine - grained time resolution of 3.3 myr .",
    "impulsive mass - loss phases , punctuated by slower gas re - accretion , produce order - of - magnitude variations in the central potential on timescales that are shorter or comparable to the crossing time for dm particles ( 50100 myr at 0.51 kpc ) , creating an efficient channel for transferring kinetic energy from the gas to the dm , causing dark matter to migrate irreversibly outwards , and transforming a central dm density cusp into a near - constant density core @xcite . note that dm particles belonging to the central cusp do not become unbound but are typically displaced into the halo , with a distribution function that peaks today at @xmath70 45 kpc from the center ( bottom right panel in the figure ) .",
    "our simulations of realistic field dwarfs confirm that large dm cores are an unavoidable consequence of bursty star formation , shed light on the energetics and timetable of the cusp - core transformation , and show that sn feedback can effectively remove dm cusps in systems with @xmath71 .",
    "because luminous dwarfs form the bulk of their stars prior to redshift 1 and the amount of work required to remove a dm cusp scales approximately as @xmath72 , the unbinding of the cusp starts early and the formation of cored dm profiles is energetically less demanding than estimated in non - cosmological idealized calculations .",
    "we note that a stellar initial mass function that is shallower than the @xcite functional form assumed in our simulations , like that recently measured in two ultra - faint dwarfs by @xcite , would increase the sn feedback energy reservoir even further .",
    "measurements of cored dm mass profiles in field dwarfs with @xmath73 appear then to be needed to provide a more powerful challenge to cdm - based models .",
    "it is also important to stress at this point that solutions to the core - cusp problem rest crucially upon the efficiency with which stars form in dm halos , and that the @xmath74 stellar mass fractions , @xmath75 , of bashful and doc are in excellent agreement with the stellar mass - halo mass ( smhm ) relation for present - day dwarfs derived by @xcite .",
    "the low mass power - law behavior of the smhm relation is broken on dwarf galaxy scales , corresponding to an upturn in the stellar mass function below @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "such an upturn at low stellar masses implies that dwarf galaxies have higher stellar mass fractions than predicted by assuming a scale - free power law below @xmath77 . _",
    "in particular , an @xmath78 halo at @xmath74 ( like doc ) may be expected to form in excess of @xmath79 in stars .",
    "this is an order of magnitude larger than assumed on these mass scales by @xcite .",
    "_         bright dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies in the halo of the milky way have estimated virial masses at infall well above @xmath80 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our simulations may therefore offer a solution to some of the tension between @xmath0cdm predictions and detailed observations of these systems .",
    "@xcite have recently introduced a method for measuring the slope of the total mass profile , @xmath81 for dsphs that have chemodynamically distinct , equilibrium stellar subcomponents that independently trace the same spherical dark matter potential . applied to published spectroscopic data for the fornax and sculptor dsphs",
    ", this technique yields slopes of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with cored dark matter halos of constant density over the central few hundred parsecs of each galaxy and rule out cuspy navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profiles ( @xmath84 at all radii ) with a high significance . with stellar masses of @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xcite , fornax and sculptor",
    "are located in the region of the @xmath44@xmath87 plane in figure [ fig3 ] where 0.51 kpc cores are indeed expected to develop .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig4 ] compares the @xmath88 values observed in these dsphs with those measured in the hydrodynamic and dm - only simulated profiles of bashful and doc , showing how sn feedback alone may explain the observed mass profiles of luminous dsphs .",
    "another version of the core - cusp puzzle in dsphs is the so - called  too - big - to - fail \" problem , which is based on the finding that the most massive subhalos in dissipationless simulations of milky way - size halos have too high central densities to host any of its bright satellites @xcite . in terms of subhalo",
    "maximum circular velocities and dsph circular velocity profiles , the problem can be simply stated as follows .",
    "a milky way - size halo is predicted to host several massive subhalos with maximum circular velocities today in excess of @xmath89 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  the putative hosts of the brightest dsphs .",
    "using subhalo profiles computed from dm - only simulations  typically well - described by the nfw functional form ",

    "whereas in our control dm - only simulation , bashful ( @xmath90 ) and doc ( @xmath91 ) are indeed too dense to be compatible with any known satellite of the milky way , in the hydrodynamic run none of the simulated dwarfs has a circular velocity profile exceeding @xmath4 in the inner 1 kpc , i.e. , milky way satellites do not appear to have significantly less mass near the center than our simulated , @xmath92 , field dwarfs .",
