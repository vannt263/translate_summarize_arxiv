    "the spatial and kinematic configuration of the local group ( lg ) galaxies is very uncommon in the local universe and in cosmological simulations .",
    "the lg is dominated by two big spirals : the milky way ( mw ) and m31 , the next most - luminous galaxy is m33 which is @xmath6 times less massive than m31 , followed by several dozen less luminous dwarf galaxies , up to a distance of @xmath7mpc .",
    "the velocity vector of m31 , with a low tangential velocity is consistent with a head - on collision orbit toward the mw @xcite .",
    "another feature of the local group is the relatively low velocity dispersion of nearby galaxies up to @xmath8 mpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the environment around the local group has density quite close to the average density of the universe @xcite .",
    "in addition , the closest massive galaxy cluster , the virgo cluster , is @xmath9 away @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lg is located in a diffuse and warped filament / wall connecting virgo cluster with fornax cluster , some nearby galaxies and groups members of this large structure are the maffei group , ngc @xmath10 , ngc @xmath11 , m@xmath12 , m@xmath13 , ngc@xmath14 , cen a group @xcite . at this scale ,",
    "there is no evident alignment of the mw - m31 orbital plane with any local filament or the virgo - fornax direction .",
    "however , if we look in a smaller volume below scales of @xmath15 mpc , there is a clear alignment of the mw - m31 orbit with a local plane of galaxies as shown by figure @xmath16 in @xcite . on top of that , the satellite galaxies in the mw and m31 present different kinds of strong alignments along planes @xcite , which are sometimes considered as unusual in the context of the @xmath0 cold dark matter ( cdm ) model @xcite .",
    "this combination of features makes lg analogues uncommon . using numerical simulations @xcite found less than @xmath17 mw - sized halos",
    "reside in a pair similar to mw - m31 and in a similar environment . furthermore ,",
    "if we select pairs constrained within @xmath18 error from current observational measurements of the velocity components and distance to m31 , there are only @xmath19 systems in a cubic volume of @xmath20 side , giving a number density @xmath21mpc@xmath22 , comparable to the abundance of massive clusters . a similar abundance was found by @xcite by comparing the formation history of lg pairs in constrained simulations with the results of unconstrained cosmological simulations .",
    "@xcite also studied mw - m31 pairs in numerical simulations finding the typical quantities characterizing the orbital parameters of the lg are rare among typical pairs , but not sufficiently rare to challenge the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "another set of criteria for lg analogues was used by @xcite , but despite differences in the definitions and resulting fraction of lg analogues , results are in agreement with a low pairs frequency as well .    to better understand the properties of the lg and how this uncommon pair configuration can be explained in the cosmological context ,",
    "some questions arise .",
    "what else can we say of the environment of the lg on larger scales ?",
    "to what extent is this an expected configuration in @xmath0cdm ?",
    "in particular , which are the typical / preferred locations of these systems within the cosmic web ?",
    "are the preferential alignments of satellites a result of the location of the lg in the cosmic web ?    in this paper",
    "we address those questions by studying the large scale environment of lg analogues in the context of @xmath0cdm .",
    "we use the bolshoi simulation to explore in what structures they reside and if there is any correlation or alignment with the cosmic web .",
    "the large scale environment is defined by the cosmic web components identified by @xcite , and we use the lg analogues computed by @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : simulation ] we present the n - body cosmological simulation and the algorithm to define the cosmic web , next in section [ sec : lg_analogues ] we describe the sample of lg analogues extracted from the simulation . in section [ sec : results ] we present our results to wrap up with a discussion and conclusions in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we use the bolshoi simulation of @xmath0cdm cosmology : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xcite , compatible with the constraints from the wmap satellite @xcite .",
    "the simulation followed the evolution of dark matter in a @xmath27 box with spatial resolution of @xmath28 kpc and mass resolution of @xmath29 .",
    "halos are identified with the bdm algorithm @xcite .",
    "the bdm algorithm is a spherical overdensity halo finding algorithm and is designed to identify both host halos and subhalos .",
    "the web finding algorithm is based on the tidal tensor computed as the hessian of the gravitational potential field    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , @xmath32 refers to the three spatial comoving coordinates and @xmath33 is the gravitational potential renormalized to follow the poisson equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the matter overdensity .",
    "this tensor is real and symmetric , which means that it can be diagonalized .",
    "we denote its eigenvalues as @xmath36 and their corresponding eigenvectors @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath5 . the web classification compares each one of the three eigenvalues to a threshold value @xmath39 . if the three , two , one or zero eigenvalues are larger than this threshold the region is classified as peak , filament , sheet or void , respectively . because this tensor is also known as the tidal tensor we refer to it as the tweb algorithm .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed study for the topology of the cosmic web and its visual counterpart as a function of the parameter @xmath39 .",
    "they found that reasonable results in terms of the volume fraction occupied by voids , the visual inspection and the halo populations in each web type can be reached by values of @xmath40 . in this paper",
    "we choose the value of @xmath41 to proceed with our analysis .",
    "this is only relevant to the classification of the simulation into web elements .",
    "other results are completely independent of this choice .",
    "nevertheless we have checked that the main conclusions of this work do not depend on the precise choice of @xmath39 .",
    "the algorithm to compute the potential is grid based .",
    "first we interpolate the mass into a cubic grid with a cloud - in - cell ( cic ) scheme and smooth it with a gaussian kernel in order to reduce the grid influence in the computations that follow .",
    "then we obtain the gravitational potential using fft methods and use finite differences to compute the hessian at every point in the grid . in our case",
    "we have used a grid size and a gaussian smoothing with two times larger as the typical separation between the two halos in the local group .",
    "the purpose of this choice is to have both halos in the pair a common environment . in this paper",
    "we use a grid spacing of @xmath42 , corresponding to a @xmath43 grid in the bolshoi volume . the scale for the gaussian smoothing uses the same value .",
    "we use the matter overdensity , ellipticity and the prolatenes to further characterize the web .",
    "these quantities are defined in terms of the eigenvalues as follows @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46    we also measure the alignment of the lg halos with respect to the cosmic web defined by their eigenvectors . to this end",
    "we characterize each lg pair by two vectors .",
    "the first is @xmath47 , the axis along the orbital angular momentum of the pair , normal to its orbital plane ; the second is @xmath48 , the vector that connects the halos in the pair which can be related to the alignment of the radial velocities to the web .",
    "we quantify the alignment using the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between the two vectors of interest @xmath49 or @xmath50 , where @xmath32 .",
    "we have veryfied that the main trends reported in this paper remain unchanged if we use the results from a @xmath51 grid smoothed over scales of @xmath52 .",
    "small changes of a factor of @xmath53 in the smoothing scale do not significantly impact the cosmic web as it was shown in @xcite from the study of the volume and mass filling fractions for different smoothing scales .",
    "other works have also shown that broad features the cosmic web , as defined in this paper , are robust to factor of @xmath53 changes on the scale defining the web @xcite .",
    "the data of the bdm halos and the tweb is publicly available through a database located at http://www.cosmosim.org/. a detailed description of the database structure was presented by @xcite .",
    "to construct a sample of the mw - m31 pairs at @xmath54 , we use a series of simulation snapshots at @xmath55 ( since the last @xmath56 gyr ) spaced by @xmath57 myr .",
    "this is done because a particular configuration of mw and m31 is transient and corresponds to a relatively small number of systems at one snapshot . by using multiple snapshots we can increase the sample of systems in such configuration during a period of time in which secular cosmological evolution is small .",
    "the lg analogues or the general sample ( gs ) in this paper are pairs selected in relative isolation , and in a wide range of masses from @xmath58 @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "isolation criteria include pair members closer than @xmath61mpc , and with no massive neighbors within @xmath62mpc .",
    "in addition , we require that pairs have no virgo - like neighbor halo with mass @xmath63 within @xmath64 mpc .",
    "we have @xmath65 pairs under these general criteria .",
    "a full description of the selection criteria can be found in @xcite .",
    "we also define two subsets of restricted samples ( rs ) more closely related to the mw - m31 dynamics according to the tolerance in additional constraints . a sample named @xmath18 , corresponding to lg analogues constrained by two times the observational errors in the orbital values ( radial velocity , tangential velocity , and separation ) , and a more relaxed sample named @xmath66 for lg analogues constrained by three times observational errors accordingly .",
    "the number of pairs in each sample is @xmath19 and @xmath67 respectively , notice we have less pairs than in @xcite , since we removed pairs which are too close at @xmath68 , i.e. their virial radii overlap , also we removed a couple of pairs that merged or change their mass more than @xmath69 at present time since they were detected at @xmath55 .",

    "[ fig : jj_alignment],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the first result we explore is the kind of environment occupied by our lgs , and use as reference sample the gs where pairs are much more relaxed in mass and kinematic constraints .",
    "we find that the pairs in the gs are located across all different evironment without any strong preferences ; @xmath70 are located in sheets , @xmath71 in peaks , @xmath71 in filaments and the remaining @xmath72 in voids .",
    "the situation in the @xmath18 and @xmath66 samples is very different . by and large the lgs in these samples",
    "are located in filaments and sheets . in both samples , @xmath73 of the pairs can be found in filaments while @xmath74 are in sheets .",
    "these absolute numbers in each environment for each sample are presented in table [ table : web_type ] .",
    "we find that the difference between the gs and the rs can be explained by the total pair mass . in @xcite",
    "the mass range covered by @xmath18 and @xmath66 samples is very narrow and it is used to constraint the lg mass .",
    "we show in table [ table : web_type ] that a subset of the gs having a similar mass range than the rs reproduces similar environment fractions .",
    "the correlation between halo mass and their environment is a well known result @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : median_fraction ] summarizes this correlation between environment an total pair mass .",
    "each line represents the mass distribution of pairs in the four different environments for the gs .",
    "high mass pairs tend to be located in peaks and filaments while less massive ones in voids and sheets .",
    "the shaded regions represent the @xmath75 confidence intervals of the mass distributions of @xmath18 and @xmath66 samples .",
    "we now characterize the preferred place of the pair samples in terms of the web overdensity , ellipticiy and anisotropy as defined in section [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "figure [ fig : median_overdensity ] shows the dependency of these three characteristics on the total pair mass for the different samples .",
    "gs is represented by the solid lines with the associated errors covered by the shaded region .",
    "the symbols represents the results for the @xmath18 and @xmath66 samples . in the three cases it is evident that the range of values for the @xmath18 and @xmath66 samples are completely expected from the mass constraint alone .",
    "the left panel shows the overdensity dependence on pair mass .",
    "higher mass pairs are located in high density regions .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath66 samples having a narrower mass range as shown in previous figure , are consequently located within a narrower range of overdensities @xmath76 peaking at @xmath77 .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that these samples are mostly found in filaments and sheets .",
    "middle and right panels show web ellipticity and absolute prolateness dependence on mass .",
    "again we notice that within the @xmath18 and @xmath66 mass range , the average ellipticity and prolateness does not differ significantly from the gs expectation . in the rs samples the pairs",
    "are located in a narrow range for ellipticities @xmath3 and absolute prolateness @xmath78 .",
    "we now study different alignments of the lg with respect to the cosmic web .    *",
    "orbital angular momentum*. figure [ fig : alignment_n ] shows the cumulative distribution of @xmath79 for the three eigenvectors @xmath32 .",
    "lines in each panel correspond to different samples .",
    "the straight line across the diagonal shows the expected result for vectors with randomly distributed directions .",
    "there are two important features in figure [ fig : alignment_n ] .",
    "first the alignments themselves . there is a strong anti - alignment signature between @xmath47 and the third eigenvector . with respect to the first and second eigenvector",
    "the distribution is consistent with no alignment .",
    "second , the alignment strength changes for the different samples . for the anti - alignment with @xmath5",
    "the signal strengthens as we move from the gs to the 3@xmath80 into the 2@xmath80 sample .",
    "quantitatively , the anti - alignment feature found with the @xmath5 vector means that for 2@xmath80 sample , @xmath73 pairs have @xmath81 ( @xmath82 degrees angle ) , and @xmath83 pairs have @xmath84 ( @xmath85 degrees angle ) .",
    "these signals do not change significantly on different environments as has been already show in different alignment studies with similar @xcite or identical @xcite web finding techniques as ours . in particular , these trends hold for pairs in filaments and walls .",
    "if we consider only pairs in filaments , we have that the pair orbital angular momentum tends to be perpendicular to the filament direction , in the case of sheets it tends to lie perpendicular to the sheet plane .",
    "the alignment strength could be explained to a great extend by a total mass dependency . in figure",
    "[ fig : median_alignment_n ] we show the median of @xmath79 and @xmath86 in different mass bins .",
    "lines show the median @xmath87-mass relation for the three eigenvectors in the gs , dots represent the results for the 2@xmath80 - 3@xmath80 samples . around the total mass @xmath88 in the rs samples ,",
    "the median of @xmath87 clearly from the 2@xmath80 and 3@xmath80 samples clearly differs from the gs results .",
    "however , the uncertainty level on the median for a small sample ( indicated by the shaded region ) makes this trend compatible with the values from the gs sample .",
    "we also explored characteristics in the orbits which could be responsible of the strengthen alignment feature .",
    "we have that rs samples constrains the tangential velocity , as a consequence pair orbits are more eccentric as we tighten pair constraints .",
    "for the gs sample there is no tangential velocity constraint at all .",
    "we studied the relationship between orbit eccentricity and alignment computing for each halo pair in all samples an approximate orbit eccentricity assuming a two body orbit with masses set as the virial masses and initial conditions given by current velocity vector and separation .",
    "we found that selecting a subsample of gs having the same eccentricity than 2@xmath80 - 3@xmath80 samples does not increase in the alignment when compared with the full gs .",
    "* radial vector*. figure [ fig : alignment_r ] presents the results for the eigenvectors alignments with respect to the vector connecting the two halos . in this case",
    "we find that the vector @xmath48 is strongly aligned along the direction defined by @xmath5 and anti - aligned along @xmath37 ; correspondingly the signal along @xmath38 is rather weak .",
    "we also find a stronger signal as we move into more restrictive samples , although the signal from the gs is already very significant .",
    "quantitatively , the alignment feature with @xmath5 means that for the 2@xmath80 and 3@xmath80 samples , @xmath73 pairs have @xmath89 ( @xmath90 degrees angle ) and @xmath91 pairs have @xmath92 ( @xmath93 degrees angle ) .",
    "similar to the previous case of the @xmath47 vector , the increasing strength of the @xmath48 alignment can be explained to a great extenct by a selection on mass .",
    "considering that the 2@xmath80 and 3@xmath80 samples correspond to pairs moving along the radial direction , we can say that the motion of the lg halos is mostly done along the @xmath5 vectors .",
    "this is consistent with recent results that report a strong alignment of halo s peculiar velocities along that direction @xcite .    *",
    "halo spin*. we also explore the alignment of the angular momentum ( spin ) of each pair member @xmath94 and @xmath95 with each other , the orbital angular momentum and with the cosmic web .",
    "figure [ fig : jj_alignment ] shows the cumulative distribution of dot product between angular momentum of the two halos .",
    "we find a a slight alignment of spin vectors for the @xmath18 sample with a median around @xmath96 ( @xmath97 degrees ) which is barely above the no - alignment expectation marked by the shaded region .",
    "furthermore , we found no significant alignment with the pair orbital angular momentum nor the cosmic web .",
    "the absence of alignment for the spins is consistent with different studies of spin alingnment that mark the range @xmath98as either a transition mass from alignment into anti - alignment or from no - alignment into alignment @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to table 2 in @xcite for a review on the different results of spin alignment with the cosmic web in cosmological simulations .",
    "it seems that this transition has to do with the changes on the major merger rate as a dark matter halo approaches the @xmath98mass @xcite .    in the lg ,",
    "the angle between mw and m31 spin is @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) and the angles between spins and orbital angular momentum are @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) for mw and m31 respectively @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our results of no strong alignment .",
    "the mass range of the lg pairs is tightly correlated with the properties of the web in which they reside , as shown in table [ table : web_type ] and figure [ fig : median_fraction ] .",
    "this confirms that the local overdensity , the trace of the tidal tensor , is the dominant web parameter that define the abundance and properties of halos @xcite .",
    "other quantities derived from the tidal tensor play a secondary role defining properties such as its formation history .    in our case ,",
    "the fact that the preferred lg total mass is around @xmath105@xmath106implies that the preferred environment are filaments and sheets with an overdensity close to the average value . correspondingly , the values for the ellipticity and prolateness are also well defined for the lg pairs given its correlation with the total mass .",
    "we conclude that the typical lg environment and its characteristics is a robust results depending mostly on the lg total mass .",
    "the alignments with the cosmic web have also a mass dependency .",
    "although they seem to be stronger once the kinematic constraints are imposed on the gs pairs , the results are consistent with the a simple mass cut on the gs sample .",
    "there is a clear anti - alignment between the third eigenvector and the orbital angular momentum vector , meaning that this vector is perpendicular to filaments and the sheets , we also found that the vector joining the lg halos are aligned with the third eigenvector .",
    "this means that he pair is aligned with the filaments and lies on the sheets and its motion is done along these directions .",
    "these alignment features are in agreement with the scenario that pairs created in - situ or falling into a filament / wall align their orbits with the large scale structure in a relaxation process where pair members tend to moves along the slowest collapsing directions",
    ".    how can we relate these alignments to the observed lg ? to evaluate this point we use observational information for the satellite distribution around the lg galaxies .",
    "the mw satellites are located at high galactic latitudes forming a planar structure that forms an angle of @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) with the vector joining the mw and m31 ; while the m31 satellites are on a plane that lies on the same vector @xcite .",
    "most @xmath0cdm studies find that sub - structure infall direction is done along @xmath109 ( the direction of filaments ) @xcite or almost over the plane defined by the @xmath38 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "taking this three points together ( the alignment of mw - m31 along @xmath5 , the observed satellite alignments and the preferential infall along @xmath5 ) we have that the m31 plane of satellites is completely consistent with the average alignment picture we have described .",
    "however , the plane defined by the mw satellites should also be close to parallel with respect to the vector joining mw and m31 and the plane of m31 satellites . instead ,",
    "this plane has @xmath108 with respect to these directions .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the spatial location of mw satellites raises a potential contradiction with the average expectations from @xmath0cdm , a point that has been mentioned before @xcite .    this apparent contradiction can be solved if one considers that the subhalo infall properties depend on the environment at _ the merger time _",
    ", while the alignments for yet unvirialized pairs such as the dominant galaxis in the lg depend on the current state of the cosmic web .",
    "this also explain the absence of a strong alignment with halo spin , because it reflects past configurations of the web , not the current one . from this perspective",
    ", a joint consideration of the alignments between the dominant halos in the lg and their satellites , which also feature strong signals , should inform us about the structural evolution of the cosmic web around the lg .",
    "our results raise the need to observationally constrain the alignments of lg pairs with their cosmic web environment . to this end",
    "one could use mass reconstructions from large surveys @xcite or filament finders @xcite to select a lg sample to quantify the alignments with the surrounding filamentary structure .",
    "this would allow not only a direct quantification of how common are the lg alignments but also provide a new test of @xmath0cdm .",
