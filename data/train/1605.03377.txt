    "materials bearing local resonators are known to support unique dynamic phenomena , such as negative , highly anisotropic , and extreme effective properties @xcite .",
    "systems exhibiting these phenomena are commonly referred to as `` locally resonant metamaterials , '' and are often described using linear dynamical models .",
    "one well - known model is a chain of `` mass - in - mass '' unit cells , which consists of a lattice of interconnected lumped masses , each with coupled local resonators @xcite . by incorporating nonlinearity into locally resonant metamaterials , their dynamics become more complex . for example , metamaterials for both acoustic @xcite and electromagnetic @xcite waves have demonstrated numerous nonlinear phenomena , including tunability , harmonic generation , and the existence of nonlinear localized modes .",
    "a promising means to create nonlinear acoustic metamaterials is provided by granular media , which consist of closely packed systems of particles that interact elastically .",
    "granular media have been shown to support a wide range of nonlinear dynamic phenomena not encountered in conventional materials @xcite . in granular materials , the microstructural geometric nonlinearity that stems from the shape of particles in contact ( commonly modeled using hertzian contact mechanics @xcite ) results in an effective macroscopic nonlinear material response .",
    "previous works on granular media have demonstrated numerous nonlinear effects , including solitary waves , shocks , discrete breathers , tunable band gaps , frequency conversion , and non - reciprocal wave propagation @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental works have combined the concepts of locally resonant metamaterials with granular media .",
    "relevant contexts include , but are not limited to , frequency shifting , harmonic generation , and localized band gap modes @xcite , traveling waves , including ones with non - vanishing tails @xcite , wave interaction @xcite , and localized and extended modes @xcite , as well as temporally periodic breathing states  @xcite ( to which we will return in what follows ) . in each of these examples ,",
    "the granular media provided a nonlinear intersite coupling , while the local resonators were linear .",
    "less attention has been paid to cases in which granular particles play the role of nonlinear local resonators .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a one - dimensional , mass - in - mass system with linear intersite coupling and nonlinear local resonators that follow the hertzian contact model .",
    "one motivation for considering this model is its relevance in describing a granular metamaterial consisting of a monolayer of microscale spheres adhered to a substrate , wherein surface localized elastic waves , such as rayleigh surface acoustic waves ( saws ) and lamb modes , have been shown to hybridize with the contact resonances of the microspheres in thick @xcite and thin @xcite substrates , respectively . within this context",
    ", we imagine the portion of the substrate through which the localized elastic wave is traveling as a linearly coupled chain that is locally coupled to an array of nonlinear resonators representing the microspheres .",
    "systems similar to the one - dimensional , linearly coupled chain with nonlinear local resonators considered here have been previously explored .",
    "for example , amplitude - dependent band - gaps have been studied in a one - dimensional linear chain with local resonators containing a cubic nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "other relevant works have also considered linear chains with nonlinear coupling to a rigid foundation @xcite , or a nonlinear local attachment @xcite , demonstrating heavily enriched dynamics caused by small nonlinear perturbations .",
    "the structure of interest in the present work is the discrete breather ( db ) .",
    "discrete breathers are solutions that are periodically oscillating in time and exponentially localized in space  @xcite that have been studied theoretically and experimentally in many settings , involving a wide array of physical mechanisms @xcite .",
    "more recently , dbs have been demonstrated in theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies of ordered granular chains without local resonators , and theoretically in the presence of linear local resonators @xcite , as well as in nonlinear , locally resonant magnetic metamaterials @xcite and systems of electromechanical resonators  @xcite .",
    "we use our model to describe a locally resonant granular metamaterial for rayleigh saws , consisting of a monolayer of microspheres adhered to a thick elastic substrate .",
    "the two independent model parameters are fit to an experimental system used in past work @xcite , so as to provide realistic parameter values to the model wherever possible .",
    "we predict the existence of dbs in the extreme limits of vanishing and strong intersite coupling , and numerically compute a family of dbs connecting the two regimes .",
    "furthermore , we examine the frequency - energy dependence of the dbs along the relevant branch of solutions .",
    "we study the formation and evolution of the discrete breathers via direct numerical simulations , including within contexts that may be relevant to future experimental studies .",
    "our motivating physical scenario is shown in the schematic of fig .",
    "[ fig_ms_model](a ) , which describes sagittally - polarized , plane saws traveling along the surface of a thick substrate .",
    "rayleigh saws are surface localized elastic waves that travel along a solid surface ( represented as an elastic half space in theoretical descriptions ) , and have both in- and out - of - plane ( with respect to the sample surface plane ) displacement components @xcite .",
    "previous studies on monolayers of microspheres adhered to thick substrates have shown that rayleigh saws in the substrate hybridize with , and excite , microsphere contact resonances having translational out - of - plane @xcite , and coupled , in - plane , translational and rotational motion @xcite .",
    "the hybridization with each of these resonances leads to classic `` avoided crossing '' phenomena @xcite characteristic of locally resonant metamaterials and mass - in - mass chains . for the analysis herein",
    ", we focus on the avoided crossing with the contact resonance having solely out - of - plane motion @xcite .",
    "because a plane saw is confined to the surface of the medium , it can be considered as traveling in one dimension , and as such , we represent the portion of the substrate through which the saw is traveling as an infinite lattice of lumped masses @xmath0 connected by springs with linear stiffness @xmath1 . because the contact - based modes of the microspheres @xcite have frequencies much lower than the intrinsic spheroidal vibrational frequencies of the isolated spheres @xcite ( e.g. for the microspheres studied in ref .",

    "more specifically , we first choose the ratio @xmath26 such that the long - wavelength sound speed of the discrete lattice , given by @xmath27 @xcite , matches the speed of rayleigh waves in the substrate for the model from ref .",

    "the physical significance of these parameter values , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , is as follows .",
    "for large mass ratios ( @xmath32 ) , waves in the main chain ( corresponding to rayleigh saws in the substrate ) are only perturbed at frequencies very close to the local resonance ; this is confirmed in fig .   [",
    "fig_dr_fitted ] , by the relatively narrow band gap encompassing @xmath33 .",
    "the large stiffness ratio ( @xmath34 ) indicates strong coupling between lattice sites , compared to the coupling between the main chain and the resonators .",
    "intuitively , parameters much greater than unity are indeed expected for this system .",
    "this is because the spheres are much smaller and less massive than the region of the substrate beneath them that is influenced by rayleigh waves , whose displacements decay exponentially from the surface with a characteristic decay length on the order of one wavelength @xcite .",
    "similarly , the effective stiffness for the region of bulk material of the substrate influenced by the rayleigh wave can be thought to have a significantly greater effective stiffness than the relatively soft microsphere - substrate hertzian contact .",

    "[ fig_dr_fitted ] are split , as a result of the hybridization with the local resonance , into two branches : the lower ( `` acoustic '' ) branch , in which the vertical motions of the substrate surface and the spheres are in phase , and the upper ( `` optical '' ) branch , in which the motions are out of phase .",
    "the two branches of the discrete model are separated by a band gap of width @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 for the parameters values @xmath24 and @xmath25 used herein , this band gap results in an upper cutoff frequency of the acoustic branch @xmath41% below @xmath42 and a lower cutoff frequency of the optical branch @xmath43% above @xmath42 . in the continuous model , for phase velocities greater than the sound speed of transverse bulk waves ( @xmath29 ) in the substrate , the optical branch terminates ; this is because the modes above that phase velocity are so - called `` leaky '' modes .",
    "such leaky modes have complex frequency , which represents the radiation of energy into the bulk @xcite . despite this , the one - dimensional , discrete model used in this work was chosen over continuous and/or higher - dimensional models",
    "because it captures many of the important features of the dispersion relation ( linear dispersion at long wavelengths and a band gap created by a local resonance ) , and facilitates theoretical prediction of discrete breathers , and their numerical computation .",

    "the connection between this dispersion relation and the one in eq .   can be seen by taylor expanding the cosine terms of eq .  .",
    "the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation appears at @xmath80 , @xmath81 closed form analytical solutions of the nls equation can be found via the inverse scattering transform @xcite .",

    "such solutions arise when the coefficient of the dispersion term and that of the nonlinearity have the same sign , which is the case for the parameter values chosen here .",
    "thus , at first order , we have the following approximation @xmath86 which is traveling plane wave that is modulated by a small amplitude , long wavelength and slowly varying localized function . for @xmath87 ,",

    "@xmath90 represents the lower cutoff of the optical branch of the dispersion ( see eq .   with @xmath87 ) .",

    "this chain consists of a linearly - coupled main chain ( representing the substrate ) with nonlinear local resonators that follow the hertzian contact law ( representing the microspheres ) . after fitting the two independent model parameters to a system studied in previous works ,",
    "we analyze the resulting energy trapping , in the form of discrete breathers , theoretically , in the anti - continuum and continuum limits of intersite coupling , as well as numerically , by using the intersite coupling stiffness and oscillation frequency as continuation parameters .",
    "finally , we simulate the formation and filamentation  in the form of discrete breathers  of single - humped wavepackets using direct numerical integration of the equations of motion .",
    "the simulations suggest that discrete breathers may be observed in experiments on microscale granular metamaterials by generating a long - wavelength saw at high amplitude , and detecting its breakup into many small dbs .",
    "we expect this work to aid in future studies of nonlinear , microscale granular systems , as well as to the more general class of media composed of a linear material with local nonlinear resonant attachments . indeed",
    ", the dynamics and interactions of discrete breathers ( as well as their potential filamentation and dispersion ) in one- to three - dimensional analogs of such systems , may yield numerous topics that could be both theoretically intriguing , as well as experimentally accessible for further study .",
    "also , it should be borne in mind that here we only explored the focusing variants of the relevant models and their bright solitons . yet , in line with recent explorations in granular crystals  @xcite and in systems with resonators  @xcite , the self - defocusing case may also be interesting and equally accessible in different parametric regimes .    n.b . and s.p.w .",
