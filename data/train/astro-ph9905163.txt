    "theoretical studies of the cmb have shown that the accurate measurement of the cmb anisotropy spectrum @xmath0 with future space missions such as planck will allow for tests of cosmological scenarios and the determination of cosmological parameters with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , some near degeneracies between sets of cosmological parameters yield very similar cmb temperature anisotropy spectra . the measurement of the cmb polarization and the computation of its power spectrum @xcite may lift to some extent some of these degeneracies .",
    "it will also provide additional information on the reionization epoch and on the presence of tensor perturbations , and may also help in the identification and removal of polarized astrophysical foregrounds @xcite .",
    "a successful measurement of the cmb polarization stands as an observational challenge ; the expected polarization level is of the order of @xmath1 of the level of temperature fluctuations ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "efforts have thus gone into developing techniques to reduce or eliminate spurious non - astronomical signals and instrumental noise which could otherwise easily wipe out real polarization signals . in a previous paper @xcite , we have shown how to configure the polarimeters in the focal plane in order to minimize the errors on the measurement of the stokes parameters . in this paper , we address the problem of low frequency noise .    low frequency noise in the data streams can arise due to a wide range of physical processes connected to the detection of radiation . @xmath3 noise in the electronics , gain instabilities , and temperature fluctuations of instrument parts radiatively coupled to the detectors , all produce low frequency drifts of the detector outputs .    the spectrum of the total noise can be modeled as a superposition of white noise and components behaving like @xmath4 where @xmath5 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrebruit ] .",
    "this noise generates stripes after reprojection on maps , whose exact form depends on the scanning strategy . if not properly subtracted , the effect of such stripes is to degrade considerably the sensitivity of an experiment . the elimination of this `` striping '' may be achieved using redundancies in the measurement , which are essentially of two types for the case of planck :    * each individual detector s field of view scans the sky on large circles , each of which is covered consecutively many times ( @xmath6 ) at a rate of about @xmath7  rpm .",
    "this permits a filtering out of non scan - synchronous fluctuations in the circle constructed from averaging the consecutive scans . *",
    "a survey of the whole sky ( or a part of it ) involves many such circles that intersect each other ( see fig .",
    "[ inter ] ) ; the exact number of intersections depends on the scanning strategy but is of the order of @xmath8 for the planck mission : this will allow to constrain the noise at the intersection points .",
    "one of us @xcite has proposed to remove low frequency drifts for unpolarized data in the framework of the planck mission by requiring that all measurements of a single point , from all the circles intersecting that point , share a common sky temperature signal .",
    "the problem is more complicated in the case of polarized measurements since the orientation of a polarimeter with respect to the sky depends on the scanning circle .",
    "thus , a given polarimeter crossing a given point in the sky along two different circles will not measure the same signal , as illustrated in fig .",

    "as shown in fig . [ spectrebruit ] , the typical noise spectrum expected for the planck high frequency instrument ( hfi ) features a drastic increase of noise power at low frequencies @xmath9 .",
    "we model this noise spectrum as :    @xmath10    the knee frequency @xmath11 is defined as the frequency at which the power spectrum due to low frequency contributions equals that of the white noise .",
    "the noise behaves as pure white noise with variance @xmath12 at high frequencies .",
    "the spectral index of each component of the low - frequency noise , @xmath13 , is typically between 1 and 2 , depending on the physical process generating the noise .",
    "the fourier spectrum of the noise on the circle obtained by combining @xmath14 consecutive scans depends on the exact method used .",
    "the simplest method , setting the circle equal to the average of all its scans , efficiently filters out all frequencies save the harmonics of the spinning frequency @xcite . since the noise power mainly resides at low frequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ spectrebruit ] ) , the averaging transforms  to first order  low frequency drifts into constant offsets different for each circle and for each polarimeter .",

    "note that in case of a zero signal sky , setting the average of each circle to zero is better than destriping by nature because the offsets are only due to the noise . with a real sky ,",
    "both signal and noise contribute to the average so that zeroing circle not only removes the noise but also the signal .",
    "giard  et  al  @xcite have attempted to refine their method by fitting templates of the dipole and of the galaxy before subtracting a baseline from each circle .",
    "they concluded that an additional destriping ( they used the algorithm of delabrouille  @xcite ) is needed .      in order to test its efficiency ,",
    "the destriping algorithm has been applied to raw data streams generated from simulated observations using various circular scanning strategies representative of a satellite mission as planck , different `` optimized configurations '' , and various noise parameters .",
    "the resulting maps were then compared with input and untreated maps to test the quality of the destriping .    the input temperature ( @xmath116 ) maps are the sum of galaxy , dipole , and a randomly generated standard cdm anisotropy map ( we used healpix and cmbfast ) .",
    "similarly , the polarization maps @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the sum of the galaxy and cmb polarizations .",

    "given the temperature map of the sky ( not including cmb contribution ) , we can thus construct two polarization maps for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we first consider the case of destriping pure white noise and check that the destriping algorithm does not introduce spurious structure .",

    "<S> a major problem in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy mapping , especially in a total - power mode , is the presence of low - frequency noise in the data streams . </S>",
    "<S> if unproperly processed , such low - frequency noise leads to striping in the maps . to deal with this problem , </S>",
    "<S> solutions have already been found for mapping the cmb temperature fluctuations but no solution has yet been proposed for the measurement of cmb polarization . </S>",
    "<S> complications arise due to the scan - dependent orientation of the measured polarization . in this paper , we investigate a method for building temperature and polarization maps with minimal striping effects in the case of a circular scanning strategy mission such as the planck mission . </S>"
