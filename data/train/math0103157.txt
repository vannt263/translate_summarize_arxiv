    "the notion of finite order invariants has developed in knot theory .",
    "we extend it here to the setting of immersions of a closed orientable surface into @xmath1 .",
    "we give a general analysis of finite order invariants , finally classifying all order one invariants ( theorem t1 ) .",
    "a small subclass of order one invariants has previously been studied , namely , the `` local invariants '' , studied in [ g ] , [ n1 ] , [ n3 ] .    the structure of the paper is as follows : in section a we describe the self - intersection appearing in immersions which correspond to the codimension 1 ( abbreviated codim 1 ) strata in the space of immersions",
    ". they will be the basis of our definition of finite order invariants . in section b",
    "we show that there is no continuous choice of co - orientation for the codim 1 strata in the space of immersions .",
    "we show that this is not an obstacle for defining finite order invariants ; we construct the combinatorial object on which order @xmath8 invariants are defined up to order @xmath9 invariants . in section c",
    "we analyze the relations on invariants arising from local 2-parameter families of immersions . in section",
    "d we classify all order one invariants . in section",
    "e we show that for @xmath10 , the analogous classification does not hold for invariants of order @xmath11 ; in that we also complete the analysis of [ n2 ] .",
    "the space of all immersions of a closed orientable surface @xmath0 into @xmath1 is naturally stratified by the types of self intersection appearing in the immersions ; see [ hk ] for local analysis .",
    "parts of our work will also be local ; given an immersion @xmath12 and a self intersection point of @xmath13 we will look at all deformations of @xmath13 which move @xmath0 only in a small neighborhood of that intersection point .",
    "the _ local stratification _ will then mean the stratification of this smaller space of immersion and _ local codimension _ of the local strata will again refer to this smaller space .",
    "we will take a close look at the local stratification up to codim 2 .",
    "we discuss the codim 0 and 1 strata here .",
    "the codim 2 strata will be discussed in section c.    the codim 0 strata corresponds to stable self intersection , which are double lines and triple points .",
    "the codim 1 strata divide into four types which ( following [ g ] ) we call : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 . in the notation of [ hk ]",
    "they are respectively @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the four types may be demonstrated by the following local representatives , where formulae in 3-space defining the different sheets involved in the self intersection , are given .",
    "a representative of the codim 1 strata is obtained from the formulae below by setting @xmath22 . letting @xmath23 vary , we obtain a 1 parameter family of immersions which is transverse to this codim 1 stratum .",
    "@xmath14 :  @xmath24 ,  @xmath25 .",

    "this is simply four planes passing through one point , no three of which intersect in a line    a self intersection of local codim 1 ( namely @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) will be called a ce point ( after the first and last letters of `` co - dimension one '' ) . by ce point",
    "we will also refer to the point in @xmath1 where this self - intersection takes place .",
    "once an orientation is chosen for the surface , the above four types of self intersection split into twelve types , as we explain below . a choice of one of the two sides of the local codim 1 stratum at a given point of the stratum ,",
    "is represented by the choice of @xmath31 or @xmath32 in the formulae above .",
    "we will refer to such a choice as a _ co - orientation for the configuration of the self intersection .",
    "_ a completely different notion of co - orientation that we will encounter is the following : if @xmath12 is an immersion and @xmath0 is oriented then its orientation and that of @xmath1 induce a co - orientation for @xmath33 in @xmath1 . to avoid confusion between the two notions , we will use the term `` co - orientation '' only for the former .",
    "for the latter we will speak of the `` preferred side of @xmath33 in @xmath1 '' .",
    "we now present the twelve types of self intersection in the oriented setting and specify a co - orientation wherever possible :    type @xmath14 : the configuration of the self intersection at the two sides of the stratum is distinct even with no orientation on the surface , namely , for @xmath31 there is an additional 2-sphere in the image of the immersion , and we choose this side ( @xmath31 ) as our positive side for the co - orientation .",
    "now , this additional 2-sphere is made of two 2-cells ; if the surface is oriented then we may distinguish three different types of @xmath14 self intersections , which we denote by @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the number of such 2-cells for which the little 3-cell bounded by the 2-sphere lies on their non - preferred side in @xmath1 .",
    "type @xmath15 : the configuration of the self intersection on the two sides of this stratum are indistinguishable with no orientations . if the surface is oriented then we may compare the orientations of the two sheets at the time of tangency ; if they coincide then the configurations of intersection on the two sides of the stratum are still indistinguishable",
    ". we will denote by @xmath36 this type of self intersection .",
    "as explained in remark r1 below , this local symmetry of the @xmath36 configuration implies a global one - sidedness of the @xmath36 strata in the space of immersions .",
    "if on the other hand the orientation of the two sheets disagree at time of tangency , we may distinguish the two sides of the stratum ; we will consider as positive , the side for which the region in @xmath1 between the two sheets is on the preferred side of both of them .",
    "we denote by @xmath37 this type of self intersection .",
    "type @xmath16 : this is similar to type @xmath14 in the sense that the two sides of the stratum are distinguishable even in the un - oriented setting , by the additional sphere which appears on one side and which we will consider as the positive side ( @xmath31 in the formula above ) .",
    "this time the 2-sphere is composed of three 2-cells . with orientation on the surface we distinguish four types of @xmath16 intersection , which we name @xmath38 where @xmath39 is ( as for @xmath14 ) the number of 2-cells for which the little 3-cell bounded by the 2-sphere lies on their non - preferred side in @xmath1 .",
    "type @xmath17 : here as for @xmath15 , the two sides may not be distinguished without orientation ; a sphere with four faces ( bounding a simplex ) is formed on both sides of the stratum .",
    "if the surface is oriented , then the numbers of faces for which the simplex is not on the preferred side in @xmath1 , are complementary ; i.e. if it is @xmath40 on one side of the stratum , then it is @xmath41 on the other ; so they appear in pairs @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ; we name the configurations , respectively @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . for @xmath45 and @xmath46 the two sides of the stratum may be distinguished and we choose the positive side to be the side where a larger number of 2-cells have the simplex on their non - preferred side . on the other hand , for @xmath47 the two sides are indistinguishable , and as for @xmath36 , the problem is global ; the @xmath47 strata are one - sided in the space of immersions ( remark r1 ) .",
    "we fix once and for all a closed oriented surface @xmath0 and a regular homotopy class @xmath3 of immersions of @xmath0 into @xmath1 .",

    "now , the vector @xmath297 , when based at @xmath298 , points into the preferred side of @xmath298 in @xmath1 . on the other hand , @xmath297 points away from the side where the origin lies , which is the side where the simplex lies , iff @xmath299 .",
    "we conclude that if @xmath300 then the number of faces of the simplex determined by @xmath269 which have the simplex on their non - preferred side , is precisely the number of positive numbers among @xmath301 .",
    "( note that @xmath301 are all non - zero since each three @xmath297s are independent ) .",
    "the origin of @xmath98 splits @xmath271 into two half lines ; clearly the number @xmath71 of plus signs is constant on such a half - line and is @xmath302 on the other half line .",
    "so for given quintuple point , our task is to find the number @xmath71 of plus signs in each of the ten half lines of the @xmath303s .",
    "now @xmath303 has @xmath304 , so it partitions @xmath98 into the domains where @xmath305 and @xmath306 ; we thus use it to determine the sign of @xmath307 in the half - lines of @xmath308 for @xmath309 .",
    "examples of such analysis appear in figure fqq , which we now explain : each of the short thick lines in a diagram represents an @xmath303 .",
    "the arrows on each @xmath303 point to the side of it in @xmath98 where @xmath307 is positive . to determine the number @xmath71 of positive @xmath310s corresponding to a given half line of @xmath303 we need to count for how many @xmath308s ( @xmath309 )",
    "this half line lies on their positive side , i.e. the side designated by the arrows .",
    "this is the number appearing in the circle located on the given half @xmath303 in the diagram ( at the tip of the short thick line ) .",
    "finally the longer thinner lines are the @xmath265s themselves ( each drawn perpendicular to the corresponding @xmath303 ) .",
    "the pair of numbers at each tip of @xmath265 is simply copied from the corresponding sides of @xmath303 .",
    "when passing an @xmath265 , this pair of numbers ( which is of the form @xmath311 ) tells us the type of quadruple point we are passing , and the co - orientation with which we are passing it , namely , the side chosen by our permanent co - orientation is the side where the larger number of the pair appears .",
    "( as before , proposition p2 takes care of the case when there is no co - orientation . )",
    "finally we need to determine the degrees @xmath70 at each of the ten quadruple points .",
    "let @xmath226 be the degree of the quintuple point and look say at @xmath312 .",
    "we claim that the half of @xmath312 which has @xmath313 represents quadruple points with degree @xmath226 whereas the half with @xmath314 represents quadruple points with degree @xmath315 . to establish this we need to show that a quadruple point represented by a point in the half of @xmath312 with @xmath313 is obtained from a translate of our quintuple point by pushing @xmath316 into its preferred side i.e. the side pointed at by @xmath317 .",
    "recall that a point @xmath318 is of the form @xmath319 where @xmath249 is perpendicular to @xmath98 and represents a common translation of all five planes ; so @xmath320 is obtained by pushing @xmath316 away from the quintuple point represented by @xmath249 , and this push is into the preferred side of @xmath316 iff @xmath285 .",
    "it remains to notice that the sign of @xmath321 is the same as that of @xmath190 , since @xmath270 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath322 to @xmath98 .",
    "the integers @xmath226 or @xmath315 appearing at the tips of each @xmath265 in the diagrams are the degrees .",
    "once we have all this information registered at the tips of the @xmath265s , we can read off the diagram the relation determined by the given quintuple point .",
    "we claim that for any configuration of lines and arrows as above , eight of the terms cancel , always leaving the same relation : @xmath323 we offer two ways of seeing this : the first way is to verify that the four diagrams appearing in figures fqq are in fact all essentially distinct ways for choosing such distribution of arrows ; then explicitly write out the relation obtained by each of them .",
    "we only remark that there is no loss of generality by the fact that the diagrams are sketched with equal angles between the @xmath265s , since all that is relevant to us is the cyclic ordering of the @xmath303s and not the common cyclic ordering of all @xmath324 .    a second way to see that the same relation @xmath325 is always obtained is as follows",
    ": since we have five arrows pointing clockwise and five counter - clockwise , there must be two consecutive arrows which are pointing at each other .",
    "these half @xmath303s must have the same number at their tip , since they are on the same side of any other @xmath308 and are both on the positive side of each other ( i.e. the side designated by the arrow ) .",
    "we now look at the corresponding positive half @xmath265s .",
    "they both have degree @xmath226 and will both have the same number copied from @xmath303 next to them , but written on the opposite side .",
    "so their contribution to the relation is precisely the negative of each other ; the same will be true for the negative halves of these @xmath265s ( only now with degrees @xmath315 . )",
    "we now erase these two lines from the diagram and argue by ( a two step ) induction that the formal property analogous to the one we are proving , holds for the remaining three line diagram ( checking that it holds for a one line diagram . )",
    "it remains to observe that once we re - insert the two erased lines , they jointly add precisely 1 to the number at the end of all other short thick lines and so the property holds for the five line diagram .",
    "we denote by @xmath326 the subspace of @xmath182 satisfying relations eeh - eqq above and the restriction of proposition p2 , which we may write as @xmath327 .",
    "recall also that by definition of @xmath182 when using the set @xmath201 , we also have the relations @xmath209 and @xmath328 ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "now that we have obtained our relations , we return to our original @xmath85 with only twelve symbols i.e. we dispose of the redundant symbols @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "let @xmath329 be defined by @xmath330 .",
    "after some simplification , the relations defining @xmath185 may finally be presented as follows :    * @xmath331 ,   @xmath332 .",

    "we can also present @xmath363 through a universal object as follows : we define a universal abelian group @xmath364 by the abelian group presentation @xmath365 .",
    "then we define the universal element @xmath366 by @xmath367 and the value of @xmath368 on the other symbols of @xmath369 is determined by formulae 1 - 8 above , so indeed @xmath366 .",

    "it will follow that for any group @xmath2 , @xmath376 is surjective , since if @xmath377 and @xmath378 where @xmath379 then @xmath380 .",

    "given any @xmath382 we take a generic regular homotopy from @xmath383 to @xmath13 i.e. a path in @xmath3 from @xmath383 to @xmath13 transverse with respect to the global stratification .",

    "first we observe that it is 0 on null - homotopic paths . indeed ,",
    "by slightly deforming the null - homotopy , we may assume it too is transverse with respect to the stratification .",
    "if we then break the null - homotopy into small pieces and look at the value going around each little piece , then each is 0 since @xmath366 .",
    "note that the symbols encountered when going around a global codim 2 stratum which corresponds to two local codim 1 intersections occurring at distinct places , always adds up to 0 .",
    "once we have established that this sum in @xmath364 is 0 for any null - homotopic loop , we have a well defined homomorphism @xmath385 and we must show that this homomorphism is 0 .",
    "we first show this for the case @xmath386 in which case there is only one regular homotopy class , which we still name @xmath3 .",
    "now @xmath387 where the unique order 2 element is represented by one full rotation of @xmath388 in @xmath1 .",
    "such rotation passes through no ces at all , and so gives 0 as needed .",
    "let @xmath389 be the subgroup generated by this order 2 element in @xmath390 and let @xmath391 ; then we are left with showing that the map induced on @xmath392 ( @xmath393 ) is 0 .",
    "if @xmath394 is a regular homotopy , then attaching to @xmath97 one or more of the superscripts @xmath1 , @xmath388 and @xmath16 will denote respectively , composition from the left with the antipodal map of @xmath1 , composition from the right with the antipodal map of @xmath388 and reversal of time .",
    "note that these three operations on @xmath97 commute with each other .",
    "let @xmath395 be the double covering and let @xmath396 be some immersion .",

    "let @xmath402 where @xmath403 denotes concatenation from left to right , then @xmath404 is a regular homotopy from @xmath405 to @xmath406 i.e. an eversion of the sphere .",
    "also @xmath407 .",
    "we now define @xmath408 . from the presentation of @xmath409 as @xmath410",
    "we can see that there are isotopies @xmath92 and @xmath411 such that @xmath412 satisfies the conditions of [ n1 ] proposition 2.1 .",
    "it follows that @xmath409 represents an odd power of the generator of @xmath392 .",
    "we also have @xmath413 and let @xmath414 be a generic regular homotopy which is a slight perturbation of @xmath404 ( @xmath404 was highly non - generic ) , then @xmath415 will still represent an odd power of the generator of @xmath392 ( though it will not be precisely equal to @xmath416 ) .",
    "we now observe that reversing the orientations of both @xmath388 and @xmath1 simultaneously , preserves all our definitions of types , degrees and co - orientations of ces and so @xmath417 produces precisely the same element in @xmath364 as @xmath414 and so @xmath418 produces the negative of that element .",
    "so we get that the value on the loop @xmath419 is 0 .",
    "since @xmath419 represents an odd power of the generator of @xmath392 and since in @xmath364 an odd multiple of any non - zero element is still non - zero , we get that @xmath368 is 0 on the generator of @xmath392 and so on all @xmath392 .",
    "this completed the proof for the case @xmath386 .",
    "now let @xmath0 be of higher genus and let @xmath3 be a given regular homotopy class .",
    "again @xmath420 .",
    "again our claim is clear for @xmath389 which is defined as above and so again it is enough to look at the map induced on @xmath421 .",
    "looking back for a moment at @xmath388 let @xmath97 be a loop representing a generator of @xmath422 and we may assume @xmath97 fixes a given disc @xmath423 .",
    "choose a point @xmath424 on a ray perpendicular to the fixed image of @xmath77 in @xmath1 , @xmath424 being far enough so that the image of @xmath97 never passes @xmath424 . now change the constant embedding of @xmath77 to be one with a thin `` thorn ''",
    "pulled out of @xmath77 and embedded along this ray , reaching @xmath424 .",
    "the new loop @xmath425 obtained in this way also represents the generator of @xmath422 and has the property that a given point in the fixed disc @xmath77 ( namely , the tip of the thorn ) does not participate in any self intersections throughout @xmath425 . since we have already proved our result for @xmath388 , we know that the symbols encountered along the loop @xmath425 add up to 0 in the group @xmath426 .",
    "now take a tiny immersion of @xmath0 in our regular homotopy class @xmath3 , located near the tip of our fixed thorn , and connect sum it with @xmath425 for all @xmath427 , obtaining a loop @xmath428 in @xmath3 .",
    "it follows from the proof of [ n1 ] theorem 3.4 that this loop @xmath428 represents a generator of @xmath429 .",
    "since the tip of the thorn was far away from any self intersections occurring in @xmath425 , the tiny immersion will not participate in any ces occurring in @xmath409 and so will not add to the sum of symbols attained by @xmath425 , which we know is 0 in @xmath426 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath384 is well defined ; it is evident that @xmath384 is of order 1 and @xmath375 .",

    "@xmath97 induces a regular homotopy @xmath425 from @xmath116 to an immersion which differs from @xmath116 only in a neighborhood of @xmath157 and there are 0 mod 2 quadruple point occurrences along @xmath425 , precisely those occurring during @xmath97 .",
    "we complete @xmath425 to a closed loop ending at @xmath116 causing one more quadruple point to occur , namely that at @xmath157 .",
