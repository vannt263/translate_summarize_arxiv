    "shortly after the discovery of the iron - based oxypnictide superconductor lafeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 with @xmath9 of 26 k , @xcite another family of the iron - based chalcogenide superconductor @xmath10-fese with @xmath9 of about 8.5 k was reported by wu s group .",
    "@xcite later on , fang s group enhanced the @xmath9 up to 14 k by substituting se for te in the fete@xmath1se@xmath2 system .",
    "@xcite interestingly , although both fete and fes are not superconductors under ambient pressure , the superconductivity can be induced by se doping in fete@xmath1se@xmath2 as well as s doping in the fete@xmath1s@xmath11 system .",
    "@xcite while there is no sign of superconductivity in pure fete under high pressure in contrast to that the superconducting transition temperature was enhanced to 37 k , just below the mcmillan limit in fese under high pressure .",
    "@xcite superconducting @xmath10-fe@xmath12se belongs to the tetragonal symmetry system at room temperature and undergoes a structural transition to an orthorhombic phase at 90 k , while the non - superconducting fe@xmath13se does not .",
    "@xcite fese has a simpler structure by stacking only the conducting fe@xmath14se@xmath14 layers in contrast to the fe - as based superconductors having both the conducting fe@xmath14as@xmath14 layers and the blocking r@xmath14o@xmath14 layers ( r = rare earth elements ) .",
    "fete has the same structure as fese but with a rather complex magnetic structure .",
    "for example , the stoichiometric sample fete has an commensurate antiferromagetic ( af ) ordering at low temperatures after suffering a structural phase transition , while samples with excess iron fe@xmath0te has an incommensurate af ordering .",
    "@xcite according to the result of density functional calculations , the spin density wave ( sdw ) is more stable in fete than that in fese .",
    "@xcite therefore , the doped sample fete is expected to have higher @xmath9 .",
    "this was indeed observed in s or te substituted systems for se in fese .",
    "@xcite the iso - valent substitution does not directly introduce extra carriers but may change the topology of the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite recently , a spin fluctuation spectrum and a spin gap behavior were observed by neutron scattering .",
    "@xcite in fact , the nmr results indicated that the af spin fluctuations were enhanced greatly toward @xmath9 , indicating the importance of af spin fluctuations for the superconducting mechanism in fese .",
    "@xcite    as for the sample preparations , the iron - based superconductors , as previously reported , however , usually contain a very small amount of magnetic impurities , e.g. , fe@xmath15se@xmath16 and fe@xmath17o@xmath18 .",
    "@xcite therefore , in many cases the verwey - phase like transition happens around 120 k due to the existence of the magnetic impurity fe@xmath17o@xmath18 which causes a peak in the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "@xcite to elucidate the superconducting mechanism and its relation with the af spin fluctuations , it is vitally important to obtain the intrinsic susceptibility . in this study",
    ", we successfully synthesized the single crystals of fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath11 and measured their magnetic susceptibilities under high magnetic fields and obtained the intrinsic susceptibilities by using the honda - owen plot .",
    "@xcite we have found that the magnetic susceptibility of fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 ( @xmath19 ) decreases with decreasing temperature from 300 k to 20 k , similar to the results in high temperature cuprate superconductor ( la@xmath1sr@xmath2)@xmath14cuo@xmath18 , or fe - as based superconductors .",
    "@xcite in addition , we conducted electrical resistivity measurements of two single crystal samples with very close composition @xmath20 0.3 , both of which show the superconductivity at @xmath9 @xmath5 14 k under magnetic fields up to 14 t in order to estimate the upper critical field @xmath7 and the coherence length @xmath21 . as a result",
    ", the upper critical field is found to be much larger than the pauli limit , and the initial slope near @xmath9 is comparable with those of fe - as based superconductors . @xcite",
    "although fe(te - se ) is a layered superconductor , both the upper critical field and the initial slope near @xmath9 show weak anisotropies . in order to investigate the electron correlation strength ,",
    "we have estimated kadowaki - woods and wilson ratios which indicate a strongly correlated electrons picture .",
    "the superconducting coherence length and the electron mean free path are also discussed , leading to the fact that fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath11 is a clean superconductor .",
    "the high - quality single crystals of fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath11 ( @xmath3 = 0 , 0.05 , 0.12 , 0.20 , 0.28 , 0.33 , 0.45 , 0.48 and 1.00 ; @xmath22 ) were prepared from fe powders ( 4n purity ) , te powders ( 4n purity ) and se powders ( 5n purity ) .",
    "stoichiometric quantities of about 3g - mixtures were loaded into a small quartz tube .",
    "this small tube was then sealed into second evacuated quartz tube , and placed in a furnace at room temperature . the temperature was slowly ramped up to 920@xmath23c over for 36 hours and then held at that temperature for another 12 hours in order to obtain sample homogeneities .",
    "then , the temperature was reduced to 400@xmath23c over for140 hours . on the other hand ,",
    "the polycrystalline of fe@xmath0se was synthesized by previously reported solid state reaction method .",
    "@xcite    the obtained single crystal samples were ground into powders for measuring powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) with cu @xmath24 radiation .",
    "the detailed structural parameters were analyzed by rietveld refinements .",
    "the compositions of the single crystals were analyzed using sem ( jed-2300 , jeol ) equipped with an energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) spectrometer .",
    "the dc magnetic measurements were performed by using a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid , quantum design magnetometer ) . for the observations of the superconducting transitions ,",
    "both the zero - field cooling ( zfc ) and field cooling ( fc ) measurements were performed under the magnetic field of 20 oe .",
    "the temperature dependence of resistivity was measured using a standard dc four - probe method under dc magnetic fields up to 14 t with a physics property measurements system ( ppms , quantum design magnetometer ) .",
    "the current direction was parallel to the a- axis of the single crystal sample .",
    "the obtained single crystal has the layered planes held together by van der waals force only , and thus the crystal can easily be cleaved .",
    "x - ray diffraction pattern of a typical single crystal fe@xmath25te@xmath26se@xmath27 measured with the scattering vector perpendicular to the cleaved surface was shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) and the image of the single crystal is in the inset . only ( 00@xmath28 ) reflections appear , indicating that the c - axis is perpendicular to the cleaved surface . in order to get more structural information from the xrd pattern , the singe crystal were ground into powders for powder xrd measurements .",
    "figure 1 ( b ) shows xrd patterns of the selected samples of fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 ( @xmath3 = 0 , 0.05 , 0.12 , 0.20 and 0.33 ) .",
    "the real compositions were analyzed by edx measurements as listed in table i. the edx spectroscopy results show that there is a slight excess amount of fe existing in each sample , and furthermore , the se content has a smaller ratio than the nominal one .",
    "all the peaks are well indexed based on a tetragonal cell with the space group of @xmath294/@xmath30 , except for a small amount of the magnetic impurity phase of fe@xmath15se@xmath16-type , indicating that the samples are almost in a single phase .",
    "the impurity phase exits in the surface or in the inter - layers of the single crystal .",
    "it should be pointed out that there is a very small amount of fe@xmath17o@xmath18 impurity in each sample , which can not however be probed in the xrd patterns but causes a peak in temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility at about 120 k due to the verwey phase transition .",
    "@xcite with increasing se doping level , the a - axis decreases slightly , while the c - axis shrinks remarkably , which makes the ( 001 ) and ( 200 ) diffraction peaks shift to higher angles monotonously , shown as enlarged views in the inset . the cell volume is consequently decreased by substituting te for se from 92 @xmath31 to 78 @xmath31 , indicating that the samples are in a solid solution in which se enters the lattice as fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 successfully .",
    "[ fig:1 ]      since the presence of a small amount of ferromagnetic impurities which have a profound effect on the low - field magnetization as shown in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) for sample fe@xmath0te . a linear - in-@xmath32 term in high magnetic fields",
    "magnetization appears in each curve for various temperatures ; if we extrapolate the data from high magnetic fields to @xmath32 = 0 , all the extrapolation ends into almost the same point , @xmath33 , indicating the saturation magnitude moment of the impurity .",
    "according to the honda - owen plot , by extrapolating the measured susceptibility @xmath34 = @xmath35 + @xmath36@xmath37@xmath32 for @xmath38 @xmath39 0 , where @xmath34 is the measured susceptibility , @xmath35 the intrinsic susceptibility , @xmath36 the presumed ferromagnetic impurity content and @xmath33 its saturation magnetization .",
    "the influence of ferromagnetic impurities must be avoided in order to obtain the intrinsic susceptibility , @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , we use the honda - owen method to obtain the @xmath35 of these samples as @xmath40 = @xmath41 . the magnetizations were measured between 5 k and 300 k separately under magnetic fields of 3 and 4 t , or 4 and 5 t , above which the magnetizations of the magnetic impurity were supposed to be saturated .",
    "figure 2 ( b ) shows the temperature dependence of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility for samples with @xmath3 = 0 , 0.05 , 0.12 , 0.20 , 0.28 , 0.33 and 1.00 .",
    "the external field is applied parallel along the c - axis . for undoped sample fe@xmath25te ,",
    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath40 increases with decreasing temperature , and decreases sharply near 69 k , due to the af phase transition accompanied by the structural phase transition , then becomes almost the constant with decreasing temperature , in agreement with the previous reports .",
    "@xcite the susceptibility does not show any anisotropy since it has almost no distinct difference in the paramagnetic phase in cases of @xmath32//c and @xmath32//a , and even at low temperatures @xmath42(5 k)/@xmath43(5 k ) @xmath5 1.45 shows a weak anisotropy . for the superconducting sample ,",
    "the intrinsic susceptibility of the sample with @xmath3 = 0.28 under @xmath32//c and @xmath32//a also shows a very weak anisotropy as displayed in fig . 2 ( c ) . on se - doping ,",
    "the af transition shifts to lower temperature and the peak is broadened , then is hardly observed in the range @xmath44 0.12 , where the superconducting phase transition occurs at 10 k @xmath5 14 k. the upturn of @xmath40 at low temperatures , indicating a curie - weiss like behavior , which is naturally ascribed to a local moment effect . here , we noticed that the fe s possibly occupy two different sites in fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 , i. e. , fe(i ) occupies ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) site and has 1.6 @xmath51.8 @xmath45 with itinerant characters and fe(ii ) occupies ( 0.5 , 0 , z ) with a localized moment of 2.5@xmath46 .",
    "@xcite the localized moment has a strong competition with superconductivity , making the superconductivity very sensitive to the excess amount of fe in the fese compound .",
    "@xcite supposed by the band theory , the excess fe occurs as fe@xmath47 , donating one electron to the fe(i ) layer . experimentally ,",
    "there is always excess iron in fe(ii ) site and the number is lager in fete than that in fese , @xcite which may be the reason for that fese has such a high @xmath9 under high pressure while fete just changes to a metallic state at low temperatures in the same situation . @xcite",
    "in contrast to the doped sample , the end parent compound fe@xmath0se shows a very weak @xmath6-linear behavior in @xmath40 , in agreement with the @xmath48se - nuclear magnetic resonance(nmr ) measurement , @xcite confirming a good reliability of honda - owen method . in nmr measurement",
    ", the fe(i ) site contributes completely to the knight shift , strongly indicating that the fe(i ) site plays the key role to understand the superconducting mechanism in this system .",
    "@xcite furthermore , density functional calculations show that the electronic states near the fermi level are mostly of fe @xmath49 characters from the fe(i ) site and with a smaller contribution from the excess fe(ii ) site .",
    "@xcite herein , we ascribe the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility in fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 primarily originates from the fe(i ) and fe(ii ) sites .",
    "however , the magnetic susceptibility of fe(ii ) will be dominant since it has a larger local moment than that of fe(i ) site , especially at low temperatures .",
    "we suggest that the upturn in @xmath50 at low temperatures comes from the excess fe(ii ) site . in order to separate the contributions from the two different fe sites to the magnetic susceptibility",
    ", we fitted the magnetic susceptibility data with the curie - weiss law at low temperatures for sample with @xmath3 = 0.12 , 0.20 , 0.28 and 0.33 in the temperature range of 20 k @xmath51 t @xmath51 50 k as @xmath52 where the @xmath6-independent term @xmath53 contains the pauli paramagnetic susceptibility from itinerant - electron bands , the van vleck - orbital susceptibility and the larmor diamagnetic susceptibility from ionic cores , @xmath54 stands for the curie constant , and @xmath55 the weiss temperature . here , the curie - weiss term may be due to the fe(ii ) site contribution .",
    "therefore , the magnetic susceptibility of the fe(i ) can be roughly estimated as @xmath56 = @xmath40 - @xmath57 , as shown in fig . 2 ( c ) , where",
    "@xmath58 is curie constant due to the fe(ii ) site , @xmath59 the weiss temperature due to the fe(ii ) site .",
    "we also fitted the data with eq .",
    "( 1 ) by using different temperature range of 100 k @xmath51 t @xmath51 300 k for samples with @xmath3 = 0 and 0.05 ( the nominal composition is @xmath3 = 0 and 0.10 ) .",

    "in summary , we successfully synthesized the single crystal of fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 ( @xmath3 = 0 , 0.05 , 0.12 , 0.20 , 0.28 , 0.33 , 0.45 , 0.48 and 1.00 ; @xmath22 ) and measured their magnetic susceptibilities .",
