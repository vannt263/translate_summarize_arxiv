    "nonvalence quark distributions in hadrons arise from subtle and little understood quantum effects in the hadronic wave functions , which provide a unique key to hadron structure beyond the naive quark model @xcite .",
    "the sea quark distributions of the nucleon in the strangeness and charm sectors are particularly interesting and much studied examples . while charm admixtures are mainly probed in hard scattering processes @xcite , strangeness fluctuations in the nucleon can produce ( due to the smaller strange quark mass ) much larger effects which are in some lorentz channels directly measurable at low energies .",
    "mounting experimental evidence indeed indicates significant values for the nucleon matrix elements of the strange scalar @xcite and axial vector @xcite currents .    in order to further advance the understanding of the nucleon s strangeness content , both experimental and theoretical studies beyond these two channels are crucial .",
    "for once , the channel dependence provides insight into the dynamical origin of the strange - quark distribution .",
    "flavor mixing instanton - induced interactions , for example , reveal themselves in a pronounced and characteristic channel dependence pattern @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some controversial assumptions in the analysis of the existing data ( for example in the extrapolation and small-@xmath3 evolution and in the treatment of @xmath4 violations ) can be avoided in other channels .    the present paper deals with the still unmeasured vector channel , i.e. with the nucleon matrix element of the strange vector current .",
    "this matrix element is experimentally accessible at low energies and has some useful theoretical properties . in close analogy with and as a part of the electromagnetic distributions it describes the nucleon s strangeness charge and current distributions by dirac and pauli form factors .",
    "furthermore , strangeness conservation renders these form factors scale independent ( up to weak corrections ) , which avoids complications due to nonperturbative evolution from the outset .",
    "as already mentioned , essentially no experimental information on the vector form factors exists up to now ( apart from a reanalysis of older neutrino scattering data @xcite with too poor statistics to be conclusive ) . with the present experimental techniques ,",
    "however , they can be directly measured by parity - violating lepton scattering off different hadronic targets @xcite .",
    "four experiments of this type are in preparation at cebaf @xcite and mami @xcite , while sample @xcite at bates already started to take data",
    ". these experiments will measure for the first time sea quark effects in hadrons at low energies .    in anticipation of the forthcoming data several theoretical estimates of the strange form factors , primarily on the basis of nucleon models , have appeared in the literature .",
    "since sea quark effects arise from a delicate interplay of quantum effects in qcd , their reproduction in hadron models is much more challenging than the calculation of the standard static observables . reflecting these difficulties ,",
    "present nucleon model estimates @xcite contain large and often uncontrolled theoretical uncertainties .",
    "for the dirac form factor , in particular , the predictions vary by over an order of magnitude and in their sign .",
    "a comparison of some of these estimates can be found in ref .",
    "lattice simulations of the strange form factors have not yet been carried out since the computational demands increase substantially when quark - line disconnected contributions have to be taken into account ( see however @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we bypass the problems associated with these dynamical calculations by persuing a dispersive , nucleon  model independent approach .",
    "it was initiated by jaffe @xcite and becomes practicable since the isoscalar electromagnetic current carries the same quantum numbers as the strange current and thus couples to the nucleon through the same intermediate states .",
    "the available experimental data on the electromagnetic nucleon form factors can therefore be used as input for the strange form factor analysis .",
    "after updating the minimal dispersive analysis of jaffe with input from the current world data set for the electromagnetic form factors , we will focus on extensions of the spectral functions which implement information from qcd at high momentum transfers",
    ". we will be particularly interested in the implications of the qcd asymptotics for the low  momentum behavior of the form factors and their first non - vanishing moments , i.e. the strangeness radius and magnetic moment . a better understanding of the low  momentum regime is also needed for the experimental determination of the moments :",

    "let us start with a general comment .",
    "even if the 3-pole description of the spectral functions is incomplete since it can not reproduce the qcd asymptotics , this need not necessarily imply an inadequate description of the form factors in the _ low - momentum region _ ( @xmath96 ) probed at bates , mami and cebaf .",
    "indeed , the impact of the correct asymptotics on the behavior at low momenta is not _ a priori _ clear : it depends both on how much of this behavior is determined by just the low-@xmath56 strength in the spectral functions and on how exclusively the asymptotic decay originates from higher - lying strength .",
    "these two questions are of course directly related to the ( at present unknown ) momentum scale at which the asymptotic behavior sets in .    moreover , even the question of _ which _ asymptotic behavior to implement for an optimal low - momentum description of the form factors depends on this scale",
    ". qcd dimensional counting rules @xcite predict that elastic interactions of the strangeness current at large spacelike @xmath57 are ( up to logarithms ) suppressed as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 corresponds to the number of hard gluon propagators needed to distribute the momentum transfer of the probe in the target nucleon . at very large @xmath99",
    "the leading asymptotic power behavior arises from extrinsic radiative corrections , which renormalize the strangeness current .",
    "thus they are suppressed by additional factors of the strong coupling @xmath100 and decay with the same powers of @xmath101 as the electromagnetic form factors , i.e. f_1^(s ) ( q^2 ) ( ) ^2 , f_2^(s ) ( q^2 ) ( ) ^3 .",
    "[ asymex ]    however , enforcing this behavior might not be the best choice for an optimal description of the strange form factors at _ small and intermediate _ momenta in the pole approximation .",
    "alternatively , one could implement the large-@xmath3 behavior of the intrinsic contributions , which originate from @xmath102 admixtures to the nucleon wave function .",
    "although the intrinsic contributions are asymptotically subleading , f_1^(s ) ( q^2 ) ( ) ^4 , f_2^(s ) ( q^2 ) ( ) ^5 , [ asymin ] they lack the additional @xmath100suppression of their extrinsic counterparts and might thus determine the momentum dependence of the form factors at intermediate spacelike @xmath57 , i.e. before the extrinsic behavior ultimately begins to dominate . in this situation , the form factors",
    "would up to the onset of the extrinsic behavior be better described by imposing the intrinsic asymptotics ( [ asymin ] ) .",
    "the mismatch with the extrinsic behavior at very large momenta , furthermore , would then have very little impact in the low ",
    "momentum region of interest .",
    "an early transition to the asymptotic regime improves both the accuracy of the pole approximation and the chances for the appearence of an intrinsic region at intermediate momenta . at present , however , it is unknown at which momenta the asymptotic behavior sets in and whether intrinsic or extrinsic contributions dominate initially . in the following sections we will therefore consider both possibilities and analyze the minimal extensions of the 3-pole ansatz which implement either of the asymptotics ( [ asymex ] ) or ( [ asymin ] ) .    in the pole approximation ( [ npsd ] )",
