    "grs 1915 + 105  is a low mass x - ray binary , which appears to be the most distinct galactic microquasar @xcite .",
    "the system contains a black hole and a low mass k ",
    "m iii giant donor @xcite , and it has a long period of @xmath2 d @xcite .",
    "the donor , which got a variable - star name v1387 aql , fills its roche lobe and supplies the matter accreted by the black hole .",
    "the first determination of the mass of the black hole based on a measurement of the radial velocity amplitude , @xmath3 , was by @xcite , who , observing with the vlt , obtained @xmath4 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this indicated that the system contains one of the heaviest galactic black holes with the mass of @xmath6 ( assuming the binary inclination of @xmath7 of @xcite ) .",
    "this measurement was later refined by @xcite , who also used the vlt but at a higher spectral resolution , and obtained @xmath8 km s@xmath5 , which , given that @xmath9 , results in a reduction of this mass .",
    "the exact value depends on the inclination , which , for grs 1915 + 105 , is usually determined from the jet kinematics , which , in turn , depends on the distance to the source @xcite .",
    "after the successful radio parallax measurement by @xcite , the distance is determined to be @xmath10 kpc , which then yields @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this distance determination is consistent with an independent estimate of @xmath12 kpc by @xcite based on considering the jet kinetic power .",
    "while the mass of the black hole may be now considered as relatively precisely known , it is less so for the mass of the donor .",
    "the first rough estimate implied by the spectral classification ( k  m iii ) was proposed by @xcite as @xmath13@xmath14 . however",
    ", this is a range typical for isolated giants of these classes @xcite , while the donor in grs 1915 + 105  could have lost a large fraction of its mass .",
    "this has been confirmed by measurements of the rotational broadening .",
    "first , @xcite found it as @xmath15 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this quantity combined with @xmath3 yields the binary mass ratio , @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite used the value of @xmath3 of @xcite , which yields @xmath17 .",
    "the current best measurement of the rotational broadening is that of @xcite , @xmath18 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this value combined with their @xmath3 measurement yields @xmath19 . for the distance - dependent black - hole mass estimate of @xcite , this gives @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the donor has the mass substantially lower than that of an isolated star of the same spectral class , i.e. , it is a stripped giant ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter wrs83 ) .",
    "we note that @xcite gave a rather conservative estimate on the error of @xmath21 . from the bottom panel of their fig .",
    "4 we would infer a standard deviation of @xmath223 km s@xmath5 , which would translate into a standard deviation of @xmath23 of @xmath220.017 , and that on the standard deviation of @xmath24 of @xmath25 . even then , the uncertainty on the donor mass is rather large .",
    "we explore here another possibility to constrain the donor mass based on modelling of its internal structure .",
    "since the donor is not a main sequence star but rather an evolved low - mass giant , its structure is relatively simple and easy to model . making use of the observational constraints on the luminosity and the radius of v1387 aql",
    ", we construct an evolutionary model of this star and attempt to constrain its mass .",
    "for that , we also need the effective temperature of the donor .",
    "the currently most accurate nir observations of this system are those of @xcite , who matched their spectra to those of k0 , k1 , k2 , k5 iii and m0 iii template stars .",
    "thus , we adopt here the possible range of the spectral classes , which appears to be due to a typo . ] from k0 iii to m0 iii .",
    "from the third kepler law , we have the separation of the components as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total mass .",
    "the relation between the radius of the optical component ( which must be equal to the radius of its roche lobe ) and the separation of the components for @xmath28 is @xcite @xmath29 from equations ( [ kepler][roche ] ) we have @xmath30    let us note that generally equation ( [ r_k ] ) makes radius of the donor filling its roche lobe one of the most accurately determined parameters of that star .",
    "the orbital period is usually known with the high precision and the dependence on @xmath24 is weak .",
    "moreover , equation ( [ r_k ] ) does not depend on the distance to the binary system .",
    "for discussion of the accuracy of equation ( 3 ) see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "given the small uncertainty on the period , its contribution to the error is negligible .",
    "the roche - lobe radius for a given donor mass of equation ( [ r_k ] ) , @xmath31 , is , in fact , identical to that implied by the rotational broadening , @xmath32 for @xmath33 substituted in the former . here",

    "@xcite used the weighted average of the inclination resulting from the observations by @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite argued that the jet direction changes between the projected distance from the centre of @xmath39 ( observed by @xcite ) and @xmath40 @xcite , and thus the results of the former are more relevant for estimating the binary plane orientation , resulting in @xmath41 .",

    "@xcite argued that the alignment is very likely , and this assumption has indeed been universally used in the mass estimates for grs 1915 + 105 . on the other hand , an also likely and widely accepted , model for the low - frequency qpos / breaks in the power spectra of black - hole binaries",
    "is the lense - thirring precession of an inner hot part of the accretion flow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this model requires a misalignment between the black - hole spin and binary axes , though the minimum required misalignment appears not to be specified .",

    "this gives usually steeper dependencies .",
    "it corresponds to considering also the second term in equation ( 1 ) for @xmath89 of wrs83 .",
    "finally , we can consider @xmath88 for our solutions , imposing the stellar radius equal to that of the roche lobe of a given mass .",
    "this does not correspond to any evolutionary sequence , but just parametrises our results for @xmath90 d. this , in turn , gives a flatter dependence .",
    "we compare our radius vs.  the core mass dependencies with the results of wrs83 ( and of @xcite , who retained only the first order in their formulae ) .",
    "they correspond to the first case above , i.e. , for evolution of an isolated star , and averaging over neglecting the dependence on @xmath24 .",
    "given that we use different chemical composition and more contemporary physics ( especially opacities ) , our results , while qualitatively similar , are quantitatively different .",

    "[ rad_mc ] , especially for low masses ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "so far , we have made use only of the value of the radius of v1387 aql ( which can be determined precisely for a given total mass using equation [ r_k ] ) .",

    "all of the solutions have the temperatures of @xmath994160 k , which correspond to the spectral class of k5 iii @xcite .",

    "we superimposed a mass outflow at about eddington rate on our model a , and found that the internal radiation flux in the outer layers started to decrease toward the surface , indicating that these layers were departing from thermal equilibrium . however , this departure was very small .",
    "the surface luminosity of the model with the outflow was smaller by less than 1 per cent compared with the model without outflow .",
    "the obtained values of the luminosity show a similar steep dependence ( excluding @xmath56 and @xmath106 ) on the core mass to that of wrs83 of @xmath107 , but our normalization is @xmath10850 per cent higher , @xmath109^{8.15 } , \\label{l_mcore}\\ ] ] with the relative error @xmath1103 per cent . combining it with the dependence of @xmath69 assuming the roche - lobe radius for the observed @xmath111 ( the third case at the end of section [ core_radius ] ) , we find @xmath112 , which is shown in fig .",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ mdot_m2 ] by the solid line .",
    "the disagreement at the lowest masses is a boundary effect , caused by @xmath132 at the exact minimum possible mass ( as discussed above ) .",
    "we can compare the obtained mass transfer rates with the average accretion rate required to power the outburst of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "we used for that the results of @xcite . from their fig .",
    "5 , we infer the average observed bolometric flux corresponding to @xmath1083/4 of the eddington luminosity for @xmath139 , pure h and at @xmath140 kpc assumed by them , which is @xmath141 erg @xmath142 s@xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath143 erg s@xmath5 , and the accretion rate of @xmath144y .",
    "we can compare our estimate of @xmath145 with that of @xcite , which gives @xmath146 erg s@xmath5 , a very similar value .",
    "we thus adopt @xmath147 erg s@xmath5    at the observational best - fit donor mass value of @xmath148 and at our corresponding value of @xmath114 ( table 1 ) , the duty cycle is about 5 per cent .",
    "the accreted mass during the 25 y of the outburst is @xmath149 .",
    "these values can be four times higher at the maximum allowed mass of @xmath80 , or much lower at the lowest allowed donor masses .",
    "see @xcite for estimates of the disc mass in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "we can compare our results with those of @xcite .",
    "he used the fits of wrs83 and considered the donor mass of @xcite as @xmath150 .",
    "thus , his best fit value of @xmath151 is @xmath152y , which is comparable to our values at @xmath1530.9 .",
    "a potentially important effect we have neglected is the irradiation of the donor by the x - ray source ( pointed out by @xcite ) . at the parameters at @xmath154 , the donor subtends a solid angle of @xmath155 ( see equation [ roche ] ) , and",
    "the ratio of the irradiating luminosity ( neglecting shielding and assuming isotropy ) to @xmath156 ( emitted by the hemisphere facing the black hole ) is 33 . at the estimated duty cycle",
    ", the average irradiating luminosity is larger than the intrinsic one , which may affect our estimates .",
    "we have studied constraints on the present mass and radius of v1387 aql by constructing evolutionary models of the internal structure of this star .",
    "we have compared the resulting radii and luminosity of our physical models to observational constraints .",
    "we find solutions with stripped giants of the mass of @xmath157 and of the spectral class k5 iii , independent of the distance to the system , and a distance - dependent upper limit , @xmath158 .",
    "we have also obtained the constraints from the observed nir magnitude of the companion , which are found to be consistent with the other constraints . finally , we have estimated the mass transfer rate , which we found to be @xmath159 . comparing to the average luminosity of grs 1915 + 105 ,",
    "we obtain the duty cycle of @xmath160 per cent .",
    "these two numbers are 4 times lower at @xmath148 , which is the observationally - determined best - fit mass .",
