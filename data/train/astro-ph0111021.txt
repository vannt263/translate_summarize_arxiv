    "characteristics of h@xmath0 surges have been studied for many years ( e.g. roy 1973 ) .",
    "those are summarized by @xcite as follows : ( 1)h@xmath0 surges are straight or slightly curved spikes that are shot out of a small mound , ( 2)on the solar disk , they appear usually in absorption , but in their initial phase , sometimes in emission , ( 3)they also show strong tendency to recur . @xcite and @xcite have reported that h@xmath0 surges are often found at the earliest stage of emerging flux regions ( efrs ) and continue recurrently for many hours .",
    "they have also suggested that magnetic reconnection between a newly emerging flux and a pre - existing magnetic field is the essential mechanism of h@xmath0 surge production .",
    "@xcite showed in their numerical simulation that such a reconnection really produces h@xmath0 surges in efrs .",
    "@xcite found that h@xmath0 surges are also ejected from a light bridge of a sunspot umbra .",
    "however , no detailed study has been made of plasma ejections from a light bridge until now .",
    "we use the term `` light bridge '' to refer to a bright , long , and narrow feature penetrating or crossing a sunspot umbra .",
    "light bridges are often seen in umbrae of mature and stable sunspots , and have been considered to have the same magnetic polarity as that of the sunspot umbrae , while their field strength is much weaker @xcite .",
    "we found that conspicuous h@xmath0 surge activities occurred along the light bridge of the sunspot umbra in the active region noaa 8971 on 2000 may 02 , with 60 cm domeless solar telescope ( dst ) at hida observatory , kyoto university .",
    "h@xmath0 surge activities continued intermittently for about 6.5 hours , as long as the time span of our observation . examining",
    "the extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) images obtained with the transition region and coronal explorer ( _ trace _ ) @xcite , we found similar ejections from the light bridge in 171  ( fe ix / x ) images .",
    "such ejections from a light bridge have never been reported before in the euv wavelength . from now on",
    ", we refer to the ejection seen in 171  images obtained with _",
    "trace _ as `` 171 - ejection '' .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the morphological and the dynamical characteristics of the ejections from the light bridge , using the h@xmath0 and the 171  images of high spatial and temporal resolution obtained with dst and _ trace _ , respectively . in  2 , we summarize the observational data , and in  3 , we present observational results and discussion . in  3.1 ,",
    "we report the features of the h@xmath0 surges obtained with dst , and in  3.2 , compare them with 171 - ejections .",
    "then we discuss the magnetic configuration of this region and possible mechanisms for the surge activity in the light bridge in  3.3 .",
    "our results are summarized in  4 .",
    "we have observed the surge activities along the light bridge in the active region noaa 8971 ( n20@xmath4 , w55@xmath4 ) with dst from 23:00 ut on 2000 may 01 to 05:30 ut on may 02 . the h@xmath0 monochromatic images were obtained with the zeiss lyot filter of 0.25  @xmath5passband and sony laservideo disc recorder sequentially in 3 wavelengths : h@xmath6  , @xmath7  , and @xmath8  . the successive wavelength - change and recording",
    "were controlled with a personal computer , and the time capture for each wavelength was 12 seconds . in this study",
    "we mainly used the h@xmath9  images , in which their ejecting motions are clearly seen .",
    "the euv images of this region obtained with _",
    "trace _ are available from 04:30 ut to 06:00 ut on may 02 .",
    "they also show conspicuous ejections along the light bridge . the _ trace _ 171  images were used to compare the features of the hot ejections of about 10@xmath3  k with those of h@xmath0 cool surges of about 10@xmath1  k. to co - align the h@xmath0 images with the euv images , we used a _ trace _ 1600  image .",
    "there are a few soft x - ray images obtained with sxt ( soft x - ray telescope ) aboard _ yohkoh _",
    "@xcite during the time interval from 05:20 ut to 05:30 ut on may 02 . to process the _ trace _ and _ yohkoh _ sxt images",
    ", we used the solar software of idl .    in figure 1 , the times of h@xmath0 and euv observations are summarized , where each time is represented by plus ( + ) sign . the second and",
    "the fourth rows show the times when the ejections along the light bridge are distinctly identified at h@xmath0 and 171  , respectively , and numbered thick lines in both rows show that they are especially `` conspicuous '' ejections .",
    "we mainly studied the event which occurred at 04:46 ut on may 02 ( # ( 7 ) in figure 1 , 2 , and table 1 ) , because the ejection was clearly seen both in h@xmath0 and in euv .",
    "during the observation of dst , which was about 6.5 hours , h@xmath0 surges were ejected intermittently from the light bridge of the sunspot umbra in noaa 8971 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows eight surges which extended to larger than 11,000 km in apparent length .",
    "they are the largest among a number of surges observed in this light bridge . in figure 2 ,",
    "the _ top left _ is the image at h@xmath10  , and the others are at h@xmath9  .",
    "the mean apparent velocity of these surges is about 40  @xmath11 , the mean apparent maximum length is about 17,000 km , and the mean lifetime is about 10 minutes .",
    "these features of the eight surges are listed in table 1 .",
    "we correct these values for the the projection effect . assuming that the surges are vertically ejected from the solar surface , we get the velocity of 50  @xmath11 and the maximum length of 20,000 km .",
    "the surges we observed are a few times smaller in velocity and about an order of magnitude smaller in maximum length than those described by @xcite .",
    "we also found ejections from the light bridge in 171  images obtained with _",
    "trace_. these 171 - ejections have occurred intermittently just as h@xmath0 surges . for the event of 04:46 ut ( # ( 7 ) in figure 1 , 2 , and table 1 ) , we compared the h@xmath0 surge with the 171 - ejections with respect to their morphological and dynamical characteristics .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of the ejection in h@xmath9  ( _ top _ ) and _ trace _ 171  ( _ middle ; negative _ ) .",
    "the _ bottom right _",
    "panel is a _",
    "yohkoh _ sxt image overlaid with the contour of the sunspot umbra .",
    "the three panels in the _ bottom left _ box show the comparison of the appearance and the site of the ejections .",
    "the rightmost panel in the box gives the spatial relation among the sunspot umbra , the h@xmath0 surge , and _ trace _ 171  loop , where they are displayed in dark gray , light gray , and black curved line , respectively .",
    "the timing and location of the ejections in _ trace _ 171  images are almost the same as those of the surges at h@xmath12  .",
    "furthermore , the velocity of the 171 - ejection is about 40  @xmath11 , and it is nearly equal to that of h@xmath0 surge ( see table 1 ) .",
    "however , the appearance of the ejections are different between the h@xmath0 images and the euv images ; that of h@xmath0 surge is like a jet , while that of 171 - ejection looks like a reverse u - shaped loop .",
    "the h@xmath0 surges seem to be ejected along some open magnetic field lines of about 5,000 km in width , and about 12,000 km in length . on the other hand ,",
    "the 171 - ejections ( hot plasma ) are reverse u - shaped loops that trace the edge of h@xmath0 surges ( cool plasma ) ( see the _ bottom middle _ cartoon in figure 3 ) .",
    "the separation of two foot points of the loop is about 5,000 km , and the loop top is about 12,000 km in hight . the growth of the reverse u - shaped 171  loops indicates the existence of some bipolar magnetic polarities in the light bridge of the sunspot umbra .",
    "in addition , as will be discussed below with the magnetograms (  3.3 ) , the emergence of some new magnetic flux is probably occurring there .",
    "we examined soft x - ray images for the same region obtained with _ yohkoh _",
    "sxt , which provide information of the plasma of much higher temperature ( more than 3 mk ) .",
    "however , we did not find any sxt ejections according the locations of the h@xmath0 surges and euv ejection in the light bridge .",
    "such difference between the appearance of cool ( about @xmath13  k ) surges in h@xmath0 and hot plasma ejections in 171  ( about @xmath14  k ) and in soft x - ray ( more than 3 mk ) images indicate some dynamical and thermal characteristics of plasma ejection in the light bridge of the sunspot umbra .",
    "they should be explained by a proper model of the accelerating and heating mechanism .      the continuous surge activity , which was found in the light bridge of the sunspot umbra (  3.1 ) ,",
    "is considered to be evidence of emerging magnetic flux ( e.g. kurokawa & kawai 1993 ) .",
    "the reverse u - shaped loop seen in _ trace _ images (  3.2 ) also suggests the emergence of a bipolar magnetic flux .",
    "figure 4 shows the magnetograms on april 27 ( _ top _ ; near the disk center ) and on may 02 ( _ bottom _ ; near the northwest limb , n20@xmath4 , w55@xmath4 ) obtained with the michelson doppler interferometer ( mdi ) on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) @xcite .",
    "the sunspot has negative polarity ( black ) .",
    "the polarity of the light bridge is also negative , though its field strength is much weaker than the main sunspot umbra ( april 27 _ top _ ) . on may 02 ( _ bottom _ ) , positive polarity ( white )",
    "is seen at the location on the light bridge .    since the sunspot is located close to the solar limb ( 55@xmath4 ) on may 02 , it is difficult to determine whether this opposite polarity is an indication of the newly emerging magnetic flux or whether it appears only due to the projection effect of the negative polarity field .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that some negative polarity which is inclined more than about 40 degrees from the normal produces the fake positive polarity .",
    "nevertheless , we suggest that unresolved and small newly emerging magnetic flux plays an essential role in the long - lasting surge activity . to conclude that new bipolar magnetic fluxes really emerge in light bridges and produce such surge activities by magnetic reconnection , we need more precise observations of magnetic fields of light bridges , near the disk center and with higher spatial resolution .",
    "we studied dynamical characteristics of h@xmath0 surges along a light bridge in a sunspot umbra with the dst at hida observatory .",
    "the surge activities continued intermittently for a long time , at least 6.5 hours .",
    "the apparent velocity of the surges was about 50 @xmath11 in average , and it is typical for that of an h@xmath0 surge .",
    "we also studied the ejections from the light bridge observed in euv coronal line of 171  with _ trace _ for the first time .",
    "the apparent velocities of 171 - ejections were almost equal to those of h@xmath0 surges .",
    "we could not find any ejections from the light bridge in _ yohkoh _ sxt images .",
    "this means that the temperature of plasma ejected from the light bridge is lower than a few mk .",
    "we found morphological differences between h@xmath0 surges and 171 - ejections ; the 171 - ejections seem to be a loop , while the h@xmath0 surges are like jets . examining the magnetogram obtained with _",
    "mdi , we suggest that the emergence of new flux occurs in the region , though we can not exclude the possibility that the opposite polarity is due to a projection effect .",
    "we need more precise observations of magnetic fields of light bridges .",
