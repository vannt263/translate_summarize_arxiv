    "we define a new momentum variable for the ks quark propagator , @xmath21 we can then decompose the inverse propagator @xmath22 where the factor of 16 comes from the trace over the spin - flavor indices of the staggered quarks and @xmath23 from the trace over color . comparing eqs .",

    "landau gauge fixing is performed by enforcing the lorentz gauge condition , @xmath32 on a configuration by configuration basis .",

    "[ fig : lan_ks_zm05_comp ] and  [ fig : lan_asq_zm05_comp ] we see that the asqtad action displays clearly better rotational symmetry in the quark @xmath26 function and , curiously , improved infrared behavior as well .",

    "we see firstly that these three gauges give very similar results ( we shall investigate this in more detail later ) and secondly that they give similar performance in terms of rotational symmetry and statistical noise .",

    "@xmath34(iii ) performs very poorly : see figs .",
    "[ fig : lap3_asq_zm05 ] and  [ fig : lap3_asq_m05 ] .",

    "we have seen that this type of gauge fixing fails to produce a gluon propagator that has the correct asymptotic behavior  @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that we are dealing with matrices with vanishing determinants , which are destroying the projection onto @xmath35 .",
    "we expect the degree to which this problem occurs to be dependent on the simulation parameters and the numerical precision used ( in this work the gauge transformations were calculated in single precision ) .",

    "the @xmath26 function in the laplacian gauges is more strongly infrared suppressed than in the landau gauge .",
    "there may be a small difference in @xmath40 between @xmath34(i ) and @xmath34(ii ) gauges .",
    "in all cases the quark @xmath26 function demonstrates little mass dependence .",
    "deviation of @xmath26 from its asymptotic value of 1 is a sign of dynamical symmetry breaking , so we expect the infrared suppression to go away in the limit of an infinitely heavy quark . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lan_asq_zcomp ] we show the @xmath26 function in landau gauge for the lightest and the heaviest quark masses in this study .",

    "[ fig : lap2_asq_zcomp ] shows @xmath26 in @xmath34(ii ) gauge for three quark masses .",
    "again , the data are consistent , to within errors , but there is a systematic ordering of lightest to heaviest .",
    "we conclude from this that behavior is consistent with expectations , dependence on the quark mass - if any - is very weak .",
    "one possible explanation is that all the masses studied are light - less than or approximately equal to the stange quark mass - and that heavier masses will affect the @xmath26 function more clearly .    the mass functions in landau and @xmath34(i )",

    "the mass functions are nearly identical in @xmath34(i ) and @xmath34(ii ) gauges : see fig .",
    "[ fig : comp12_asq_m05 ] .",
    "the asqtad quark mass function at each value of the mass has been cylinder cut and extrapolated - by a quadratic fit - to zero mass .",
    "the quadratic fit was chosen on purely practical grounds and a linear fit worked almost as well .",
    "a fit to each of the mass functions was then done , using the ansatz @xmath41 which is a generalization of the one used in ref .",
    "as we have seen , the quark mass function in the laplacian gauge is almost indistinguishable from that in the landau gauge , except that it is somewhat noisier ( this may change at smaller lattice spacing ) .",
    "for this reason , we only show fits in the landau gauge .",
    "table  i shows a sample of the fits .",
    "the table is divided into two sections , one in which the parameter @xmath42 was held fixed , one in which it was allowed to vary .",

    "we have seen that the asqtad action provides a quark propagtor with improved rotational symmetry compared to the standard kogut - susskind action and that the difference between them increases as we go to lighter quark masses .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that the asqtad action has smaller mass renormalization and better asymptotic behavior .",
    "our results for the quark propagator show that the quark mass function is the same , to within statistics in @xmath34(i ) and @xmath34(ii ) gauges , while the @xmath26 function is slightly different .",
    "there is little difference between the quark mass function in landau gauge and in laplacian gauge , but the @xmath26 function dips more strongly in the infrared in laplacian gauge than in landau gauge .",
    "the infrared region of the laplacian gauge mass function seems to be particularly badly affected by decreasing quark mass .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath34(iii ) gauge gives very poor results in @xmath35 , in calculations of the quark propagator , consistent with results for the gluon propagator  @xcite .",
    "overall the landau gauge results of this work for the asqtad appear to be consistent within errors with the results of ealier landau gauge studies of the quark propagator [ 4,5,6 ] .",
