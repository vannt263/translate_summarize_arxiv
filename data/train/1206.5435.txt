    "the extreme luminosity of dusty , local sources was originally revealed by the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , e.g. soifer , neugebauer and houck 1987 , sanders and mirabel 1996 ) , whose luminosity arises from infrared emission by dust , and this dust often obscures the primary optical sources of luminosity . that such galaxies are important in the early universe was demonstrated by source modeling which indicated that the infrared dust emission from galaxies dominates the cosmic background luminosity @xcite .",

    "these two alternative measures of total line fluxes from the brightest spaxel and from f(3x3 ) are compared in figure 4 .",
    "this comparison illustrates empirically the large error that can arise from imperfect centering if using only the brightest spaxel .",

    "small centering uncertainties have little effect within the large area of the f(3x3 ) flux , so the scatter in 1.16f(3x3)/1.95f(brightest ) primarily demonstrates the uncertainty arising when using only the brightest spaxel to determine total flux .",
    "the vertical dispersion of the points and the dominance of values above unity can be explained by slight differences in source centering within the brightest spaxel .",
    "( to simplify this illustrative calculation , we apply no wavelength dependence for different redshifts to the correction factors for figure 4 because such differences are small compared to the centering uncertainties . )    for example , in the extreme case of a source being offset 5  in a direction such that the centering is on a spaxel corner , the  brightest spaxel \" would be shared evenly among 4 spaxels . in this extreme example , the brightest spaxel would have 1/4 of the flux within the 4 spaxels , or within encircled energy of radius 10  ( taken as 72% of the total flux for an unresolved source ) , so the brightest spaxel has 18% of the total source flux . for this extreme case of sharing the brightest spaxel among 4 spaxels , therefore",
    ", the correction to total flux derived only from the brightest spaxel should actually be a factor of 5.6 and not a factor of 1.95 , so the corrected total flux from the brightest spaxel alone if corrected by 1.95f(brightest ) would be erroneously faint by a factor of 2.9 .",
    "this extreme case is shown as the upper line in figure 4 .",
    "intermediate centering of an unresolved source within the brightest spaxel would lead to values anywhere between the upper and lower lines in figure 4 , so centering uncertainties alone of @xmath11 @xmath3 5  could explain the dispersion of all points in figure 4 , except for the one source falling above the upper line .",
    "extended sources would also have ratios above unity in figure 4 , and it is not possible to determine from this ratio alone whether a source is unresolved but not perfectly centered , or whether the source is slightly extended .",
    "a diffuse source so extended that it evenly fills the central 3x3 spaxels ( so each of these 9 spaxels has the same flux as the brightest spaxel ) would have log[1.16f(3x3)/1.95f(brightest ) ] = 0.73 , but no sources show this extreme ratio .",
    "this is proof that no sources are extended as large as 30 .",
    "further evidence that most sources are unresolved is the similar distribution in ratio 1.16f(3x3)/1.95f(brightest ) between starbursts and agn .",
    "if some sources are extended , they should be extended starbursts instead of unresolved agn , but starbursts show no more extension to large ratios than do the agn .",
    "the consequence to our analysis of having some marginally resolved sources would be that the total [ cii ] flux is erroneously large compared to pah , because the pah measure derives from irs measures calibrated for unresolved sources .",
    "when comparing the [ cii]/pah ratio below in section 3.2 , however , the only 3 sources with [ cii]/pah ratios significantly above the dispersion are three agn , and none of these three show any evidence of spatial extent in the pacs images .",
    "figure 4 also illustrates how upper limits for non detections are determined .",
    "the detection limit for our sample is at log f([cii ] 158 ) @xmath7 -16.7 in units of w m@xmath17 .",
    "this value is taken as the upper limit of [ cii ] line flux for the 10 sources which are not detected , according to our criterion of s / n @xmath11 3 in the brightest spaxel .",
    "in the present analysis , the mid - infrared spectroscopic features used for comparisons to [ cii ] line luminosities are the pah emission features at 6.2 and 11.3 .",
    "these values are tabulated by @xcite measured as described above in section 2.1 .",
    "the 11.3 pah is used as the pah flux measurement for comparison with [ cii ] because this feature is detected in all but two of our sources , whereas the 6.2 feature is only a limit in 25 sources .",
    "the ew(6.2 ) is used only for source classification , and all sources with limits for ew(6.2 ) have classification as agn because of the weak 6.2 pah .",
    "photoionization and photoelectric heating models for [ cii ] @xcite in comparison with previously available observations @xcite indicate that [ cii ] emission arises primarily in pdrs , with ionization produced by the hot stars of the adjacent hii region .",
    "although [ cii ] can arise in any region with singly ionized carbon and sufficiently energetic electrons for collisional excitation , the level of ionization seems the most important parameter for line strength ; models show a weakening of [ cii ] if the ionization parameter increases , resulting in a diminishing of the pdr compared to the hii region",
    ". this could be the result of harder ionization either from agn or from unusually hot stars in compact , young starbursts .",

    "the objective is an empirical observational comparison to determine how the observed [ cii ] and pah fluxes scale together when integrated over many star forming regions throughout many sources .",

    "there are various possible explanations .",
    "one possibility is that an unusual combination of radiation hardness and ionization parameter , caused by geometry , density distributions or ionizing spectrum , causes pah emission in the pdr to be suppressed while maintaining [ cii ] within the hii region @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility could be that the pah are weak because of star formation taking place in dense clouds which are so obscured that the mid - infrared pah from the starburst pdr suffers significant extinction compared to the far infrared [ cii ] .",
    "because the agn is not absorbed , such clouds would require a small filling factor or geometric placement outside of the observer s line of sight to the agn . in this circumstance",
    ", we would expect mid - infrared emission lines associated with any obscured starburst , such as [ ne ii ] 12.8 , also to be unusually weak compared to [ cii ] , and would also expect to observe excess far infrared continuum from the obscured starbursts .",
    "we defer further analysis of this question until making more comparisons among @xmath1 mid - infrared emission lines , [ cii ] and seds for our full sample of sources .      for eventual application to high redshift , dusty sources in which [ cii ] measurements with alma or other submillimeter / millimeter spectroscopy are the primary diagnostic , calibration of [ cii ] luminosity to star formation rate is our most important objective .",
    "the conclusion reached above , that [ cii ] luminosity l([cii ] ) measures the pdrs arising from star formation , encourages the calibration of sfr compared to l([cii ] ) .    determining the sfr for dusty sources ultimately traces to the method of @xcite , in which the total infrared luminosity @xmath2 is attributed to reradiation by dust of the primary stellar luminosity from the starbursts .",
    "the original calibration is log sfr = log @xmath2 - 9.76 , for @xmath2 in l@xmath4 .",
    "we adopt the updated calibration in @xcite , giving log sfr = log @xmath2 - 9.97 .",

    "this preponderance of starbursts is even greater when compared to the sample sizes ; this high sfr includes 6 of 24 starbursts , 3 of 31 composites , and only 2 of 55 agn .",
