    "theories with tev - scale supersymmetry , such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and its extensions , have long been considered to be leading candidates for new physics that can elucidate the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and address the gauge hierarchy problem associated with the standard model higgs boson . with the null result to date of searches for superpartners , and with the very recent turn - on of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) which will probe tev - scale energies at an unprecedented level ,",
    "the issue of theoretical  naturalness \" is a key question for this class of theories .",
    "of course , the question of how  fine - tuned \" a specific model is depends on the criteria used to gauge it .",
    "one general method , which has become a standard approach , is to evaluate the sensitivity to observables such as the @xmath0 boson mass @xmath1 to changes in the input parameters at a high scale , for example by the barbieri - giudice fine - tuning measure @xcite , @xmath2 in which the @xmath3 represent the parameters at the theory .",
    "this measure quantifies the extent to which electroweak to tev scale observables are sensitive to variations in the high scale parameters , and as such is a gauge of the naturalness of the theory .    however , it has recently been emphasized ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that to address the specific question associated with naturalness in light of the non - observation of supersymmetry at the lhc , which is how does the observed value of @xmath1 emerge when the superpartners must generically have masses that far exceed this value , fine - tuning measures other than @xmath4 may yield valuable information . one specific fine - tuning measure of this type is known as the electroweak fine - tuning measure @xmath5 , @xcite , which assesses the extent to which cancellations occur in the prediction of the @xmath0 boson mass as a function of the model parameters . in practical terms",
    ", fine - tuning by this measure is a reflection of the degree to which the model parameters that enter in the expression for @xmath1 are of order @xmath1 themselves at the electroweak scale ( low fine - tuning ) , or are much larger ( high fine - tuning ) .",
    "it has been emphasized previously that the naturalness measure @xmath6 can serve as a bayesian prior and as a likelihood estimate @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in the mssm , the @xmath0 boson mass is given at one loop by the following well - known relation : @xmath7 in which the @xmath8 are the one - loop corrections for down - type and up - type quarks respectively ( explicit expressions can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath5 then takes the form @xmath9 in which the @xmath10 are the terms in eq  , for example @xmath11 . as each of the @xmath10",
    "are defined at the electroweak scale , each is determined purely by the supersymmetric spectrum , independent of the high - scale dynamics and renormalization group running effects that yield that spectrum . for this reason , this fine - tuning assessment is often referred to as a determination of the degree of  electroweak naturalness \" of a given model .    in studies of electroweak naturalness for various models of the mssm soft terms",
    ", it has been noted that several general conditions at the electroweak scale result in low values of @xmath5 , and hence a small degree of fine - tuning .",
    "these conditions include ( i ) @xmath12 gev , which results in light higgsino - like neutralinos , ( ii ) @xmath13 ( as easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) ) , and ( iii ) large @xmath14 , which is neeed to raise the higgs mass without requiring heavy stops .",
    "these conditions are not easily met within certain classes of models , but can be achieved in others . in the 19-parameter phenomenological mssm ( pmssm )",
    "@xcite it is to be expected that there are regions of parameter space that meet these criteria and hence yield low values for @xmath5 , which was shown explicitly in a recent study @xcite .",
    "similarly , this can also be achieved in the 19-parameter supergravity mode ( sugra19 ) @xcite .",
    "however , in models with fewer free parameters , clearly these conditions are more difficult to achieve .",
    "for example , minimal gauge mediation has difficulty because the @xmath15-terms are generated at two loops , and @xmath16 tends to run large and negative .",
    "models of mirage mediation ( the mixed moduli - anomaly mediation scenario @xcite based on the kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi ( kklt ) construction @xcite ) , also have difficulties , tending to have either large values of @xmath17 , for similar reasons as minimal gauge mediation , or small values of @xmath17 and fail constraints on @xmath18 meson decays @xcite ( see @xcite for studies of the phenomenology of mirage mediation ) . however , the variation on minimal supergravity known as nuhm2 @xcite , a non - universal higgs model that has six free parameters , can satisfy all of these criteria , yielding results for @xmath5 as low as @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the low fine - tuning allowed in this scenario is quite striking given that the nuhm2 is only a six - parameter model .",
    "as such , it has been dubbed  radiative natural supersymmetry \" ( rns ) , wherein the mssm and electroweak symmetry breaking arise naturally as the low energy limit of an underlying susy grand unified theory , and its phenomenological implications at the lhc and for dark matter physics have been thoroughly explored @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the question of electroweak naturalness within a class of supersymmetric models known as deflected mirage mediation ( dmm ) models .",
    "this framework is a natural extension of mirage mediation to include additional contributions from gauge mediation @xcite . in deflected mirage mediation",
    ", the gauge - mediated contributions to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters can be comparable to the gravity - mediated and gauge - mediated contributions at the gut scale , which in turn produces distinct phenomenology and a rich theory space for exploring current and future lhc supersymmetry searches , including examples of both simplified and compressed supersymmetric spectra @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the question of fine - tuning using high - scale fine - tuning measures such as @xmath4 within the dmm framework has been explored @xcite , particularly in light of the higgs mass measurement at the lhc @xcite , though there is no prior fine - tuning study of dmm using the electroweak naturalness criterion .",
    "as will be discussed in more detail shortly , the deflected mirage mediation framework , in its most general form , has a rich parameter space that can include regions that are outside the realm of the pmssm ( e.g. , that predicts nonuniversal scalar masses for the first and second generations ) .",
    "however , for phenomenological reasons , it is useful to consider only the subspace of dmm theory space that falls within the pmssm guidelines .",
    "hence , we consider this restricted dmm parameter region within this paper .",
    "this will allow for a straightforward comparison with the pmssm .",
    "we will demonstrate that within dmm models of this type , there are regions of parameter space with @xmath5 as low as @xmath20 , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is roughly equivalent to the best - case scenarios in sugra19 and slightly better than the best - case scenarios in the nuhm2/rns scenario .",
    "( here we note that direct comparisons with the pmssm scan done in @xcite are difficult as they likely have not sampled enough of the space to capture the low fine - tuned regions that sugra19 , numh2 , and dmm explore , which are all embeddable at low energy in the pmssm . )",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we quickly review the soft terms in dmm and discuss the parameter space for the subspace of dmm models of interest in this paper . in section iii ,",
    "we investigate the question of electroweak naturalness for this class of models , and show that there is a region of parameter space with extremely low values of the fine - tuning measure @xmath5 . we then summarize and conclude in section iv .",
    "deflected mirage mediation models are characterized by three classes of contributions to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters . as is the case in mirage models ,",
    "there is a kklt - like contribution to the soft masses that consists of tree - level supergravity contributions associated with a modulus field , as well as comparable anomaly mediation terms at a high scale , which is taken for simplicity to be the grand unification ( gut ) scale @xmath21 .",
    "deflected mirage mediation scenarios also include gauge - mediated contributions , which take the form of a deflection of the soft terms at some messenger scale @xmath22 .",
    "the messenger fields associated with the gauge mediation terms are typically taken to be @xmath23 vectorlike pairs of fundamental representations of @xmath24 . in these scenarios ,",
    "the mssm matter and higgs fields are also each characterized by a modular weight label @xmath25 that appears in the respective khler potential terms for each of these fields .",
    "( to be more rigorous , the khler potential for the mssm matter fields is taken to be diagonal in family space .",
    "for the matter and higgs fields , it takes the generally of the form @xmath26 , with @xmath27 ) .",
    "more explicitly , the high scale soft terms at @xmath28 take the form @xmath29 , \\\\",

    "the standard procedure has been followed in which the model - dependent higgs parameters @xmath17 and @xmath52 are replaced by @xmath53 , @xmath1 , and the sign of @xmath17 .    in a general dmm model of this type ,",
    "the soft scalar mass - squared parameters have generation - dependent labels given by the possibility of family - dependent @xmath25 values , as well as the presence of yukawa couplings in the @xmath54 and @xmath55 quantities . while the contributions to the anomalous dimensions , etc .",
    "are typically negligible for all practical purposes for the first and second generations due to the hierarchical sm fermion masses , a general assignment of the modular weights @xmath25 can yield a sizable non - universal contribution . for simplicity as well as phenomenological reasons ,",
    "we thus will always restrict ourselves to a subspace of dmm parameter space in which the matter fields all carry a universal modular weight @xmath56 . in addition , we will assume that the two electroweak higgs fields also carry an independent modular weight @xmath57 , which introduces an amount of non - universality .",
    "the dmm scenarios studied here thus have nine independent parameters ( 2 masses , 6 dimensionless parameters , and one sign ) : the mass scales @xmath31 and @xmath22 , the dimensionless quantities @xmath49 , @xmath51 , the number of @xmath24 messenger pairs @xmath23 , the modular weights @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath53 , and @xmath58 .",
    "we note that with this assumption regarding the modular weights , these scenarios represent a subset of the full 19-parameter pmssm .",
    "in our analysis of electroweak naturalness in this class of dmm models , we use a subset of the dataset as studied in @xcite .",

    "the right panel of figure [ plot : lowdeltadist ] , shows the relic density as a function of the lsp mass .",

    "the other parameters that enter into the deflection , @xmath51 and @xmath22 , do not have any preferred values . for the parameters that enter into the gut scale masses , we notice @xmath135 , with some points near @xmath136 , @xmath137 gev , and with any value of @xmath53 .",
    "similarly @xmath138 almost exclusively leads to high fine - tuning , but other combinations of modular weights lead to acceptable values of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , we see that in dmm models , the combination of gravity mediation , anomaly mediation , and gauge mediation opens up new avenues with lower fine - tuning and should motivate us to look at models beyond the minimal set , where correlations between parameters can lead to unexpected results .",
