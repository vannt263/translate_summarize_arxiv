    "to understand the first steps of the star - formation process , we must be able to follow the evolution of molecular cloud cores .",
    "one approach is to conduct spectral - line observations of molecular species whose abundances vary significantly with time .",
    "conversely , combining such observations with other types of diagnostics of cloud evolution , the chemical models may be tested .",
    "examples of species that are believed to be useful for the aforementioned purposes are complex hydrocarbons and cyanopolyynesn where @xmath3 .",
    "their abundances are expected to peak at early stages of the evolution of dark clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is because their production requires a high abundance of free neutral carbon ( ) ; a condition that is satisfied at early times in the chemical evolution , whereas at later stages practically all free carbon has been exhausted in the production of co. in contrast , molecules such as nh@xmath0 and so increase in abundance with time , because their formation involves relatively slow neutral - neutral reactions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or because they ( e.g. so ) are destroyed by or c@xmath2 .",
    "the validity of these model predictions have , to date , been tested in a rather limited sample of dark cloud cores .",
    "most observations have been confined to the taurus molecular cloud 1 ( tmc-1 ) , l134a , and to a number of `` myers cores '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; for a review see @xcite ) . however ,",
    "for current chemistry models to be rigorously tested , the cloud sample needs to be more representative of the ism . in the present paper",
    "we extend the sample of well - studied objects by two potentially very young molecular cloud cores .",
    "the first core selected for this study is located in the region of the reflection nebula cederblad 110 in the chamaeleon dark .",
    "@xcite detected a strong 1.3 mm dust continuum source towards this core , and designated it as cha - mms1 .",
    "the core belongs to an extensive , northeast  southwest directed filament of dense gas near the centre of this cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second core , cra  c ( @xcite ) is located in the southeastern ` tail ' of the r  coronae australis molecular cloud .",
    "the distances to the and the r  coronae australis clouds are 150 and 170 pc , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the smallest diameters of the c@xmath4o cores are 0.11 and 0.05 pc for cra  c and cha - mms1 , respectively .",
    "the c@xmath4o column densities towards both cores are similar : @xmath5 , which corresponds to a molecular hydrogen column density of @xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the average h@xmath1 densities derived from these numbers assuming prolate geometries are @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 for cra  c and cha - mms1 , respectively .",
    "the kinetic temperature in cra  c is 10 k or less ( @xcite ) , whereas in cha - mms1 the gas kinetic temperature as derived from ammonia observations is slightly elevated with respect to the typical dark cloud value , being @xmath10  k ( toth et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "even though both cores are supposed to be young , they represent different stages of cloud evolution .",
    "cha - mms1 probably contains a class 0 protostar ( @xcite ) , which has been recently identified with a far - infrared source , designated ced110 irs  10 , by @xcite .",
    "the core lies next to a small group of newly - born stars , the closest being ced 110 irs  4 ( @xcite ) and the newly detected irs  11 ( @xcite ) , which belong to the infrared source class i. the core is associated with a compact , north - south oriented molecular outflow ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that cha - mms1 contains the driving source of the outflow and the herbig - haro objects hh 49/50 located some @xmath11 south of the core .",
    "cra  c shows no sign of star formation activity .",
    "the core appears to be surrounded by an extensive halo : it is located near the centre of a neutral atomic hydrogen ring with a diameter of @xmath12 ( @xcite ) which may represent the outer boundary of a massive to h@xmath1 conversion region .",
    "observations of continuum emission at 100@xmath13 m and 200@xmath13 m wavelenghts with the isophot instrument on the infrared space observatory ( iso ) reveal a 200@xmath13 m excess coinciding with the centre of cra  c ( heikkil et al . 2000 , in preparation ) , suggesting that a very cold clump is located inside this core .",
    "based on these facts , one could expect cra  c to exhibit the characteristics of ` early time ' chemistry , e.g. high abundances of unsaturated carbon compounds , whereas cha - mms1 could be thought to have reached a more evolved stage . in order to test these ideas ,",
    "we have estimated for these dense cores the column densities of several molecules which show significant time dependence in chemistry models .",
    "the selected molecules are discussed in the next section . in sect .",
    "3 we describe the observational procedure . in sect .",
    "4 the results from the observations are presented and these are further discussed in sect .",
    "5 . finally , in sect .",
    "6 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we discuss here the spectroscopic and chemical properties of the molecules included in this study .",
    "table  [ table : molecules ] lists their chemical formulae , structure types ( hfs means that the lines have hyperfine structure ; o / p and @xmath14 that the molecule has ortho and para or @xmath15-symmetry and @xmath16-symmetry forms , respectively ) , permanent electric dipole moments ( @xmath17 ) along the relevant molecular axises , and rotational constants ( @xmath15 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the data were extracted mainly from the jpl catalogue ( @xcite ) ; exceptions are the ch@xmath0oh data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the value for the dipole moment of ccs ( @xcite ) .",
    "+      carbon monosulphide , * cs * , is a linear molecule with a simple rotational spectrum ; the states are denoted by the total angular momentum quantum number @xmath20 .",
    "the simplicity of the spectrum is due to the facts that in the electronic ground state , the electrons in the cs molecule have paired spins and possess no orbital angular momentum .",
    "hence , the ground state is denoted @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , the c and s nuclei have no spin .",
    "+ the dicarbon sulphide radical , * ccs * , and the sulphur monoxide radical , * so * , have more complicated spectra than cs .",
    "the electrons in the electronic ground states of ccs and so have no net orbital angular momentum , but the total spin is non - zero due to two electrons having unpaired spins .",
    "thus , the spin quantum number is @xmath22 and the electronic ground state is denoted @xmath23 ( e.g. @xcite , sect .",
    "the electron spin is coupled to the weak magnetic field arising from the rotation of the molecule . since @xmath24=1 , for each molecular rotational level with the rotational angular momentum quantum number @xmath25 , the total angular momentum quantum number , @xmath20 , has three possible values : @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , the rotational levels @xmath25 are split into triplets , whereas for @xmath29=0 only one state ( @xmath30 ) exists ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ hydrogen isocyanide , * hnc * , is a linear molecule .",
    "the nitrogen nucleus has a non - zero spin , and therefore possesses an electric quadrupole moment .",
    "this interacts with the electric field gradient of the molecule , which depends on the rotation .",
    "consequently , the nuclear spin ( @xmath31 ) is coupled to the molecular rotational angular momentum , @xmath20 , to yield the total angular momentum , @xmath32 ( @xcite , sect .  9.4 ) .",
    "the resulting hyperfine splitting of the rotational lines of hnc is smaller than for its isomer hcn .",
    "for example , for the lowest rotational transition ( @xmath33 ) the @xmath34 and @xmath35 components are separated from the main component @xmath36 by @xmath37 and @xmath38 kms@xmath39 respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the hyperfine structure is usually not resolved in observations due to doppler broadening in the source and the insufficient spectral resolution of the spectrometers available .",
    "+ cyanoacetylene , * hc@xmath0n * , is also a linear molecule . due to its high moment of inertia , it has a small rotational constant ( @xmath18 ) and its rotational transitions @xmath40 lie relatively closely in frequency .",
    "many of these lines are located in the commonly observed frequency bands , and it is often used in multi - transition studies . like hnc , it has hyperfine structure due to the nuclear spin of nitrogen . for higher @xmath20-values , however , the relative energy differences between different @xmath32-levels are very small , and so no hyperfine structure is seen in the spectra observed here .",
    "+ methyl acetylene , * ch@xmath0cch * , is a low dipole moment , symmetric top molecule .",
    "its energy levels are described by two quantum numbers @xmath20 and @xmath41 .",
    "the former represents the total angular momentum and the latter is the projection of @xmath20 on the symmetry axis of the molecule .",
    "the lowest energy state in each @xmath41-ladder is @xmath20=@xmath41 .",
    "ch@xmath0cch exists in two chemically different forms , the so called @xmath15 and @xmath16 symmetry species , depending on the relative orientations of the spins of the three hydrogen nuclei in the ch@xmath0 group . for the @xmath15-symmetry species , the @xmath41 quantum numbers are multiples of 3 ( i.e. @xmath42 ; @xmath43=0,1,2 , ... ) , while the @xmath16-symmetry species has @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; @xmath43=0,1,2 , ... .",
    "the ground - state energies for @xmath15 and @xmath16 ch@xmath0cch differ by 8.02k , @xmath16 lying higher in energy .",
    "there are no allowed electric dipole transitions between two states belonging to different @xmath41-ladders .",
    "consequently , the relative populations of two @xmath41-ladders are determined by collisional transitions and therefore depend on the kinetic temperature .",
    "in fact , the so - called ` rotational temperature ' , which can be determined from a single observation of a @xmath46multiplet ( the lines lie closely in frequency ) , is considered to be a good approximation of the kinetic temperature ( e.g. @xcite ) . + cyclo - propenylidene , * c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 * , is one of the few cyclic molecules detected in interstellar space .",
    "it is a slightly asymmetric , almost oblate top .",
    "c@xmath0h@xmath1 has _",
    "ortho_- and _ para_-states originating from the two possible relative orientations of the spins of the two hydrogen nuclei ( having @xmath47 each ) . in the ortho - state",
    "the spins are parallel ( @xmath31 ) , whereas in the para - state the spins are anti - parallel ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "since the ortho- and para - forms can not be interchanged in electric dipole transitions or easily in chemical reactions , they can be seen as two different chemical compounds .",
    "the ground - state of the ortho - form ( @xmath49 ) lies 2.35k higher than that of the para - form ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the electric dipole transitions of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 are of @xmath51-type .",
    "this means that the quantum numbers describing the projection of @xmath20 on the molecular @xmath52axes and @xmath53axes , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , change according to the rule @xmath56 , @xmath57 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ diazenylium , * n@xmath1h@xmath2 * , is a linear molecular ion .",

    ". + methanol , * ch@xmath0oh * , is a slightly asymmetric top ( e.g. @xcite , chapters 4 & 12 ) .",
    "it has a rather complicated rotational spectrum , since it exhibits so called hindered internal rotation : the hydroxyl ( oh ) group can rotate with respect to the methyl ( ch@xmath0 ) group .",
    "this gives rise to two different forms of ch@xmath0oh between which both radiative and collisional transitions are forbidden : the @xmath15-symmetry and @xmath16-symmetry forms .",
    "chemical reactions that might convert @xmath15 to @xmath16 or vice versa are believed to occur only on very long time scales .",
    "therefore the two forms of ch@xmath0oh can be treated as chemically distinct species .",
    "the ground - state of the @xmath16-symmetry form ( @xmath64 ) lies 6.95k higher than that of the @xmath15-symmetry form ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the relevant quantum numbers describing the rotational spectrum are @xmath20 and @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "the electric dipole transitions observed here are of @xmath68-type , i.e. they obey the selection rule @xmath69 .",
    "like other symmetric or slightly asymmetric tops , ch@xmath0oh may provide useful information about the gas temperature .",
    "the buildup of cyanopolyynes proceeds mainly via reactions between complex hydrocarbon ions and nitrogen atoms ( @xcite ) .",
    "hc@xmath0n is the simplest cyanopolyyne , and its abundance correlates well with heavier cyanopolyynes ( e.g. @xcite ) . due to its large dipole moment , as well as being chemically an early - time species , hc@xmath0n should be a useful probe of the conditions in pre - stellar cloud cores .",
    "+ the main reactions leading to hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cch involve either the c@xmath0h@xmath70 or c@xmath0h@xmath71 ions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the neutral reactions involving c@xmath1h@xmath1 and cch suggested recently by @xcite and @xcite do not change this fact , since these species are also derivatives of the aforementioned molecular ions .",
    "therefore , hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cch abundances are expected to be well correlated .",
    "+ reactions of nitrogen - bearing ions , such as hcnh@xmath2 , with neutral hydrocarbons may also contribute to the production of cyanopolyynes ( @xcite ) .",
    "since hcnh@xmath2 is the precursor ion of hcn and hnc ( @xcite ) , a correlation between these isomeric molecules and cyanopolyynes is possible . in this paper",
    ", we shall not address the as yet unresolved problem of the variation of the hnc / hcn abundance ratio from source to source ( for a recent overview see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we instead used hnc merely to survey the extension of the core cra  c , where hc@xmath0n was not detected .",
    "this should be as abundant as hcn but easier to detect due to the smaller hyperfine splitting , + in their survey towards dense cores of dark clouds , @xcite found a strong correlation between the ccs and hc@xmath0n column densities , and , using data from @xcite , a weaker correlation between ccs and c@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "they explained these correlations by the production of ccs in reactions between hydrocarbons and s@xmath2 , which should be abundant in regions where also carbon - chain molecules are formed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the formation of cs also involves s@xmath2 and occurs in the very early stages of chemical evolution .",
    "thereafter , cs is mainly recycled via the thioformyl ion , hcs@xmath2 , and its abundance is considered to be rather constant in time ( @xcite ) . + the correlation between hc@xmath0n and ccs is due to fact that c@xmath0h dominates the production of both molecules .",
    "hc@xmath0n is related to c@xmath0h@xmath1 via the neutral - neutral reaction @xmath72 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "complex carbon chain molecules and ccs show no correlation with ammonia , nh@xmath0 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the production of nh@xmath0 involves molecular nitrogen , n@xmath1 , which is formed in neutral - neutral reactions and becomes abundant in the later stages of cloud evolution when carbon chain molecules have already been lost in reactions with ions such as he@xmath2 , h@xmath2 and h@xmath71 ( @xcite ) .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath2 is also formed from n@xmath1 by @xmath73 and its abundance has been found to follow closely that of nh@xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , if the ccs / nh@xmath0 abundance ratio can be used as an age indicator as suggested by @xcite , the same should be true for ccs / n@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "the depletion of co onto grain surfaces further increases the n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance by making h@xmath71 available for non - carbon bearing species to react with ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ so is destroyed by neutral carbon and , like n@xmath1h@xmath2 , it is formed in neutral - neutral reactions and benefits from the freezing - out of co. its abundance therefore increases slowly and probably remains low as long as the gas is rich in neutral atomic carbon .",
    "the so abundance first increases when carbon is consumed in the production of co , i.e. at late stages in the chemical evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the late peaking of so and the stability of cs ( until it too is frozen out ) has led to the suggestion that the so / cs abundance could be used as a chemical clock ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite came to the same conclusion on the basis of pure gas phase chemistry models .",
    "however , the so / cs ratio is also sensitive to the gas - phase o / c ratio .",
    "thus , when observing the so / cs ratio in two individual clouds , it is not easy to disentangle the effects of time evolution from those of the o / c ratio .",
    "+ the precursor ion of ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath0oh@xmath70 , is formed from the radiative association reaction between ch@xmath71 and h@xmath1o ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the close relation to ch@xmath71 makes ch@xmath0oh an early - time molecule , as long as gas phase reactions are considered .",
    "the large abundances of ch@xmath0oh in high - mass star - forming cores has been explained by evaporation from grain surfaces due to shock heating ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were made in february 1998 at the swedish - eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ) on la silla in chile .",

    "hc@xmath0n was not detected in cra  c , and therefore the map was repeated in the transition pair hnc(@xmath63 ) & so(@xmath78 ) .",

    "the n@xmath1h@xmath2/c@xmath4o column density ratio is a few times larger towards cha - mms1 than cra c. two molecules which have similar column densities towards both cores are c@xmath94s and ch@xmath0oh .",

    "chemical differences between the two cores are manifest in table  [ table : ratios ] , where we list the column density ratios of several molecules .",
    "the difference is most marked in the hc@xmath0n / so column density ratio , which is at least three orders of magnitude higher towards cha - mms1 than cra c. the ratios hc@xmath0n / ccs and hc@xmath0n / n@xmath1h@xmath2 are more than a hundred times larger , and the c@xmath94s/@xmath94so ratio is about 30 times larger towards cha - mms1 than towards cra c. however , the ccs / n@xmath1h@xmath2 column density ratio is similar towards both cores .",
    "in the previous section it became evident that carbon - chain molecules are considerably more abundant in cha - mms1 than in cra c , whereas the opposite is true for so .",
    "in particular , the hc@xmath0n / so column density ratio is at least 2000 times higher in cha - mms1 than in cra  c. the fact that hc@xmath0n , ch@xmath0cch , c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 and ccs were detected without difficulty in one of the cores , but were all very weak or undetected in the other , is in agreement with the common belief that these species thrive in the same regions . for ccs ,",
    "the difference in the abundances towards the two cores is the smallest for carbon - chain molecules , being ` only ' about one order of magnitude .    as discussed in sect .",
    "2.2 , time - dependent models of gas - phase chemistry suggest that hc@xmath0n and other carbon - chain molecules reach their peak abundances at early stages of chemical evolution , whereas so becomes abundant first at later times . adopting this view , the hc@xmath0n /",
    "so abundance ratios would indicate that cha - mms1 is chemically younger than cra c. in addition , the cs / so abundance ratio has been suggested to depend on the cloud age ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the cs / so ratio is clearly larger towards cha - mms1 , which is mainly due to variation of the so abundance , since the cs abundance is rather similar towards both cores .",
    "on the other hand , it is difficult to understand in terms of pure gas - phase chemistry why cra c has a higher so abundance but a lower n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance than cha - mms1 : the production of n@xmath1h@xmath2 also increases first at later stages of chemical evolution .",
    "in particular , the fact that ccs / n@xmath1h@xmath2 column density ratio is similar towards both cores seems to contradict the expectation presented in sect .",
    "2.2 that this ratio could be usable as a chemical clock .",
    "the inclusion of freezing - out of atoms , ions and molecules onto grain surfaces causes a complication for the time - dependence of molecular abundances . according to @xcite",
    ", a second cyanopolyyne peak may occur when the depletion of gas - phase species becomes significant .",
    "the so abundance also increases considerably at this time ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the models of @xcite ,",
    "the so peak comes slightly _ after _ the second hc@xmath0n peak ( see their figs . 1 and 2 ) , probably because the c@xmath2 abundance is then lower . after the so peak , the dominant species in the gas phase are co , cs and so , until they too are depleted .",
    "it is uncertain how comparable the models of @xcite and @xcite are , however , since the former do not predict any late cyanopolyyne maximum .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath2 is included in the models of @xcite and @xcite , where depletion onto grains are taken into account . in both models",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath2 shows a late peaking , and two reasons for this peaking are given .",
    "first , n@xmath1 , which contributes to the n@xmath1h@xmath2 production , is only loosely bound in grain surfaces and returns quickly to the gas phase .",
    "second , the drop in the gas - phase abundances of co , h@xmath1o and other neutral molecules with the advance of freezing - out decreases the destruction rate of n@xmath1h@xmath2 , until the electron recombination starts to dominate its removal .",
    "finally , it should be noted that nearby or embedded young stars may revive the ion - molecule chemistry in a dense core . as discussed by @xcite , an intensified desorption of molecules from grain surfaces , the subsequent fragmentation of molecules into atoms in the gas - phase , and finally the ionization of atoms in a star - forming core may lead to increased abundances of c and c@xmath2 .",
    "these could then re - start the synthesis of complex molecules , and accordingly the chemistry would have an ` early - time ' character .",
    "we have seen that chemistry models , regardless of whether they take accretion onto grains into account or not , predict that so and n@xmath1h@xmath2 peak at late stages of chemical evolution , and that so peaks later than hc@xmath0n during the pre - stellar phase .",
    "therefore , concerning the cores studied here , it is difficult to avoid the following conclusions : 1 ) cra  c has reached an advanced chemical stage .",
    "2 ) cha - mms1 either represents the so called late - time cyanopolyyne peak or a later stage where the chemistry has been influenced by neighbouring young stars .",
    "the latter conclusion is based on the large n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance in cha - mms1",
    ". moreover , the interpretation that a collapsing cloud core containing a protostar , as cha - mms1 probably does , has reached the second , ` late - time ' cyanopolyyne peak seems more natural than that it would represent ` early - time ' chemistry , since such a core should exhibit a high degree of depletion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "possible outflows and radiation from the embedded protostar , irs  10 , or the other nearby protostars may have influenced the chemical composition of cha - mms1 .",
    "@xcite found that nh@xmath0 tends to be abundant in star - forming regions , and it seems possible that the production of nh@xmath0 , and therefore also that of n@xmath1h@xmath2 ( see sect .",
    "2 ) , somehow depend on desorption processes . on the other hand ,",
    "little time has passed since the collapse began ( which should be coincident with the second cyanopolyyne peak ) because the duration of the class 0 phase is very short ( @xmath134 years ) , and it is questionable whether the chemistry has really changed significantly during this time .    according to the models of @xcite and @xcite , where the chemical development is coupled to kinematical models , the compositions observed in cha - mms1 and cra c correspond to times a few million years after the initial state , which in these studies has been defined as a state where hydrogen is molecular but all other species are found as atoms or atomic ions .",
    "if the physical characteristics of the two cores were similar , cha - mms1 would not need to be much younger than cra c. the latter core , however , appears to have a lower average density , and therefore the chemical evolution has probably been slower there .",
    "the result is surprising , since star - forming cores of the type cha - mms1 are normally expected to be older than starless cores like cra  c. furthermore , previous observations have shown that the carbon - chain molecules are less abundant in star - forming regions than in quiescent clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "cra  c has been estimated to be gravitationally bound and therefore a potential site of star - formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the present results indicate , however , that cra c has existed long enough to reach an advanced chemical stage , which according to chemistry models implies a minimum age of @xmath135 years .",
    "this longevity raises doubts about the star - formation capacity of the core .    in quiescent cores",
    ", star formation occurs due to the cloud s self - gravity , which has to work against the thermal pressure and the pressure and tension of the magnetic fields .",
    "line emission from molecules , especially co ( as long as it is abundant in the gas phase ) , and collisions between gas and dust particles , can keep a cloud nearly isothermal even when contracting , and the importance of the magnetic support in weakly ionized cores has been recognized as the dominant factor preventing the collapse within the free - fall time , which in the case of a dense core is of the order of @xmath136 years .",
    "the magnetic support eventually gives way in the central parts of a core due to ambipolar diffusion , resulting in gravitational instability and collapse ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the density enhancement required for the gravitational collapse depends on the initial mass - to - magnetic - flux ratio .",
    "the rate at which the central density increases is related to the timescale of ambipolar diffusion ( see e.g. sect . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the timescale of ambipolar diffusion in a dense core is proportional to the fractional ionization , and is typically of the order of @xmath137 years ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this time is shorter than the time needed for reaching a chemical equilibrium in pure gas - phase models , but comparable with the depletion timescale in models in which accretion onto grain surfaces are taken into account . according to @xcite , depletion can influence the dynamical state of a core , and in the extreme case , even prevent it from collapsing by causing an increase in the fractional ionization and removing coolants .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out by ciolek & mouschovias ( 1993 , 1994,1995 ) , the properties of dust grains can affect the ambipolar diffusion timescale and thus regulate the evolution of a core .    in simulations by @xcite ,",
    "the state of a gas - cloud first becomes non - adiabatic ( i.e. the cloud is allowed to collapse ) when its temperature has risen to about 27k , at which point the rotational levels of h@xmath1 become excited . even though these authors use perhaps unrealistically low co cooling efficiences ( they neglect the cooling below 10 k ) this model may be qualitatively valid for very cold cores with highly reduced abundances of heavier molecules .",
    "if the temperature is too low , then the excitation is insufficient to provide strong enough line - emission , and a thermal balance is established .",
    "hence , it may be that such cores have a poorer star - formation ability than previously supposed .",
    "furthermore , an elevated temperature possibly is a useful diagnostic of the onset of a collapse , and could be used to identify dense pre - stellar cores that are close to forming stars .    inferring from its chemical composition ,",
    "the development in cra c seem to have been very slow indeed , or then the gravitational forces in the core are simply balanced by thermal and magnetic pressures . in the ambipolar diffusion model the slow dynamical evolution could be explained by 1 ) a low initial mass - to - magnetic - flux ratio in the surrounding cloud ; or 2 ) a high degree of ionization or a high fraction of charged dust grains , which both would lengthen the ambipolar diffusion timescale .",
    "the fact that the n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance is lower in cra c than in cha - mms1 suggests that the fractional ionization is indeed higher in the former .",
    "an alternative reason for the slow progress is that the cooling rate is very low in this core .",
    "independent determinations of the kinetic temperature , the degree of ionization , and the degree of depletion towards this core would certainly clarify this issue .",
    "based on the results of coupled chemical and kinematical models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , the high degree of depletion inferred from the molecular abundances implies a very advanced stage of evolution , and if the core is going to collapse , then this has already begun , or will do so soon deep in its interior parts .",
    "a search for infalling motions towards cra c could be therefore profitable .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the region of cha - mms1 may be an example of sequential star - formation , in which the core collapse is assisted by external forces such as stellar - winds originating from nearby young stars .",
    "this would conform with a rapid development , and may reflect favourable initial conditions for contraction and gravitational collapse in the parental cloud . in order to judge whether the chemistry in cha - mms1 is controlled by desorption or depletion , it would be useful to observe molecules which are predicted to increase in abundance when desorption mechanisms are effective . our tentative column density estimates of ch@xmath0oh ( an example of such a molecule ) did not , however , show any difference in relative abundances between cra c and cha - mms1 . detailed chemistry models of the relative timing of the hc@xmath0n , so and n@xmath1h@xmath2 peaks would therefore be valuable .    the tiny so maxima lying symmetrically on both sides of the hc@xmath0n core in cha - mms1 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : chamaps ] ) may be related to an outflow from the embedded protostar .",
    "these emission peaks and the herbig - haro object hh49/50 lie on the same line intersecting the centre of cha - mms1 , and it seems that cha - mms1 can indeed be the driving source of hh49/50 , as suggested by @xcite . the stronger so line emission towards the outflow axis may be understood in terms of an increased efficiency of neutral - neutral reactions involved in the formation of so in shock - heated gas .",
    "comparison of observed molecular column densities and abundances in two dense cores , cha - mms1 and cra  c , reveal that they have very different chemical compositions , which according to time - dependent chemistry models can be interpreted as representing different stages of chemical evolution .",
    "cha - mms1 , which is dynamically more evolved and contains a class 0 protostar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , has large abundances of carbon - chain molecules . this",
    "is normally interpreted as a signature of an early stage of chemical evolution .",
    "in contrast , cra  c , which we suspected to be virginal and therefore a likely fund of ` early type ' molecules , has , to all appearances , reached chemical maturity .",
    "this result seems to contradict the common assumption that star - forming cores are ( chemically ) older than starless cores .",
    "the chemical difference between the two cores is particularly pronounced in the hc@xmath0n / so abundance ratio , which is about 2000 times higher in cha - mms1 than in cra  c.    the fact that cha - mms1 has a large n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance arouses doubts about its chemical youth , however .",
    "namely , this molecular ion is formed from n@xmath1 , which should become abundant only at later times .",
    "in fact , cha - mms1 probably represents the ` late - time ' cyanopolyyne peak predicted by @xcite , which occurs when the freezing - out of molecules onto grain surfaces begins to be significant .",
    "alternatively , the characteristics of youthful chemistry in cha - mms1 could have developed due to outflows and ionizing radiation from the embedded protostar or the neighbouring newly born stars .",
    "it should be noted , however , that these two alternatives do not have to lie very much apart in time .",
    "a high degree of depletion should be coincident with the collapse of the core nucleus ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and cha - mms1 still contains a protostar in its main accretion phase .",
    "the fact that cha - mms1 is associated with a small cluster of young stars indicates a high star - formation efficiency in this region ( @xcite ) , which would be consistent with a rapid collapse .",
    "we have detected distinct so emission maxima on both sides of cha - mms1 , which may indicate the presence of a north - south oriented bipolar outflow .",
    "the suggestion by @xcite that cha - mms1 contains the central source of the herbig - haro object hh49/50 is strongly supported by the fact the so peaks , cha - mms1 and hh49/50 lie along the same line .    the situation observed in cra c , i.e. low abundances of carbon chain molecules and the large",
    "so and n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundances , correspond to final stages of pure gas - phase chemistry evolution or to the ` so peak ' which comes after the late cyanopolyyne peak in the model of @xcite , in which gas - grain interactions has been taken into account .",
    "the lack of star - formation activity in the chemically ` old ' core cra  c shows that the dynamical evolution has been slow there or that the core may have even reached an equilibrium .",
    "this may be due to a low mass - to - magnetic - flux ratio in the surrounding cloud , or a high degree of ionization or a high fraction of charged dust grains making the ambipolar diffusion time very long ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , insufficient cooling efficiency due to freezing - out of heavy molecules may have increased the thermal support .",

    "<S> because of the high n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance , we suggest that cha - mms1 represents the ` late - time cyanopolyyne peak ' that is predicted to occur when heavy molecules start to freeze onto grain surfaces ( @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> . this would also be a more natural explanation for the carbon - chain molecules than the ` early - time ' picture in view of the fact that the core is presently collapsing to form a star . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances observed in cra c can be explained either by pure gas - phase models at late stages of evolution , or by the ` so peak ' which follows the second cyanopolyyne peak ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dynamical evolution in cra c seems to have been very slow compared with that of cha - mms1 , and we discuss possible reasons for this .    </S>",
    "<S> we detected two so emission maxima around cha - mms1 , which lie symmetrically on both sides of the core , approximately on the line connecting the centre of cha - mms1 and the position of herbig - haro object hh49/50 . </S>",
    "<S> these so peaks may signify the lobes of a bipolar outflow , and the observation supports the suggestion by @xcite that cha - mms1 is the central source of hh49/50 . </S>"
