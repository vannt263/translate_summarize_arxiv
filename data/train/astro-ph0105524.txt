    "hard x - ray observations are very efficient in tracing emission due to accretion mechanisms , like in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "hard x - ray selection is not affected by strong biases present at other wavelengths .",
    "for example , a column of a few times @xmath5 cm@xmath3 has negligible effect in the 5 - 10 kev band , while it reduces by @xmath7 times nuclear emission below 2 kev .",
    "optical and uv color selection is biased against objects with even modest extinction or an intrinsically ` red ' emission spectrum ( see e.g. vignali et al . 2000 , maiolino et al .",
    ". however , the space density and evolutionary properties of the hard x - ray sources are still basically unknown .",
    "we therefore decided to take advantage of the large field of view and relatively high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the bepposax mecs ( boella et al .",
    "1997a , b ) to perform a large area survey in the hardest band ( 510 kev ) which is reachable so far with imaging instruments .",
    "chandra and xmm - newton go much deeper than bepposax at low energies , but in the 5 - 10 kev band the bepposax mecs collecting area is comparable to that of chandra acis and it is a factor of 5 - 10 smaller than that of xmm - newton epic pn .",
    "however , the mecs field of view is a factor of about 7 larger than that of the chandra acis - i instrument and about 3 times larger than that of the xmm epic pn .",
    "therefore , these instruments will cover , at least for the first few years of operations , a relatively small portion of the sky .",
    "the bepposax shallower but larger area survey nicely complements deep pencil beam _ chandra _ and xmm_newton _ surveys ( mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 , giacconi et al .",
    "2001 , hasinger et al .",
    "2001 , hornshemeier et al 2001 ) .",
    "the main scientific purpose of the bepposax mecs survey is therefore to study the nature of the hard x - ray source population and in particular to provide a relatively large sample of sources bright enough to measure , with the present generation of x - ray satellites , their main x - ray spectral properties this will allow for the first time the statistical study of the distribution and evolution of the obscuring gas in a hard x - ray selected sample",

    "these indicates that the bepposax survey has resolved 20 to 30% of the hard xrband that the large majority of the sources so far identified are agn in agreement with optical identifications results of asca surveys in the 210 kev energy range ( akiyama et al .",
    "interestingly enough the fraction of obscured agn among the about 70 optically identified hellas sources is higher than in the rosat and asca samples ( fiore et al .",
    "1999 , fiore et al .",
    "2000 , la franca et al . in preparation ) .",
    "in this paper we present the survey and discuss the sources x  ray spectral properties .",
    "an analysis of the bepposax mecs position reconstruction accuracy is presented in the appendix . a companion paper ( comastri et al .",
    "2001 ) compares the observed number counts and absorbing column density distribution with agn synthesis models for the hard x - ray cosmic backgrund ( xrb ) .",
    "the high energy large area survey ( hellas ) has been performed in the hard 4.5 - 10 kev , ` octave ' wide , band for three reasons : a ) this is the band closest to the maximum of the xrb energy density which is reachable with the current imaging x - ray telescopes ; b ) the bepposax mecs ( boella et al .",
    "1997b ) point spread function ( psf ) greatly improves with energy : in the 4.5 - 10 kev band it is a factor of @xmath8 sharper than in the softer 1.5 - 4.5 kev band ( providing a 95 % error radius of 1 , see the appendix and ricci et al 1998 ) , which allows optical identification of the sources ; c ) the mecs background ( on - axis , internal + 70% cosmic x - ray background ) is @xmath9 counts s@xmath10 arcmin@xmath3 ( 3 mecs units ) in the 4.5 - 10 kev band and @xmath11 counts s@xmath10 arcmin@xmath3 in the 1.3 - 4.5 kev band . so using the higher energy band only , reduces the total background by @xmath12 , enhancing the chance of detecting faint , highly obscured or very hard sources , with few counts below 4.5 kev .",
    "about 85 square degrees of sky have been surveyed in the 4.5 - 10 kev band using 142 bepposax mecs high galactic latitude ( @xmath13 deg ) fields .",
    "there is no overlap among the fields and , wherever possible , multiple observations of the same field have been merged in one single pointing to increse the sensitivity .",
    "fields were selected among public data ( as march 1999 ) and our proprietary data .",
    "fields centered on bright extended sources and bright galactic sources were excluded from the survey , as well as fields close to lmc , smc and m33 .",
    "most of the fields have exposures between 30 and 100 ks , and 20 fields have an exposure higher than 80 ks ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "coadded , sky coordinates mecs1+mecs2+mecs3 images ( or mecs2+mecs3 images after the loss of mecs1 on may 7th 1997 ) have been analysed .",
    "sources were detected in images accumulated between 4.5 and 10 kev .",
    "the lower limit is chosen to include in the band the xenon l edges ( the mecs energy - pi relationship is non - linear accross the edge ) . cleaned and linearized mecs event files in the bepposax sdc on line archive have always been used in this analysis .",
    "the reader is referred to the sdc on - line documentation and to fiore , guainazzi & grandi ( 1999 ) for details on data reduction .",
    "we have used a variation of the detect routine included in the ximage package ( giommi et al . 1991 ) to detect the x - ray sources .",
    "the method consists in first convolving the x - ray image with a wavelet function , to smooth the image and increase contrast , and then in running a standard slide - cell detection method on the smoothed image , to locate count excesses above the local background .",
    "the detection algorithm has been run several times for each field , changing the size of the slide - cell and the width of the wavelet function to take into account the variation of the mecs psf with the off - axis angle , and to improve the efficiency in detecting extended sources .",
    "the quality of the detection has always been checked interactively . in particular ,",
    "sources near the mecs fe@xmath14 calibration sources have been carefully tested for reliability running the detection algorithm after excluding a narrow energy interval centered on the iron feature at 5.894 kev .",
    "the final net counts are estimated from the original ( un - smoothed ) image , to preserve poisson statistics .",
    "the background is calculated using ten source - free boxes near the source region and is rescaled at the source position to take into account the spatial variations of the mecs background ( see the bepposax sdc on line `` cookbook '' , http://www.asdc.asi.it/bepposax/software/cookbook , and chiappetti et al .",
    "175 sources have been detected in the 4.5 - 10 kev images with a probability higher than 99.94 % that they are not poisson fluctuation of the background ( after excluding the targets of the observations ) .",
    "the analysis of the 2 - 10 kev images is reported by giommi , perri & fiore ( 2000 ) .",
    "source count rates in four bands ( 1.310 kev , total , t , 1.32.5 kev , low band , l , 2.54.5 kev , middle band , m , and and 4.510 kev , high band , h ) were extracted and corrected for the energy dependent vignetting ( as calibrated in orbit using a series of observations of the crab nebula at different off - axis angles , conti et al .",
    "1997 , cusumano & mineo 1998 ) and for the mecs psf ( using an analytical approximation of the psf calibrated using observations of agns and compact galactic sources , conti et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the mecs 4.5 - 10 kev psf half power radius is @xmath15 arcmin at off - axis angles @xmath16 arcmin , it increases to @xmath17 arcmin and @xmath18 arcmin at off - axis angles of 18.8 and 24.5 arcmin respectively .",
    "even at these large off - axis angles the core can be safely considered axisymmetric . for faint sources ( @xmath19 )",
    "all corrections were done at fixed energies , close to the mean energy for a power law spectrum with @xmath4 in the three bands l , m and h. for brighter sources the correction was done by convolving the vignetting and psf functions with the source count histogram in the three l , m and h bands .",
    "the count rates were converted to fluxes using a conversion factor of 7.8@xmath20 ( 5 - 10 kev flux ) per one `` 3 mecs count '' ( 4.5 - 10 kev ) , appropriate for a power law spectrum with @xmath4 .",
    "the factor is not strongly sensitive to the spectral shape , due to the narrow band : for @xmath21 and 0.8 it is 8.1 and 7.6 @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "a conversion factor of 9.9@xmath20 per one `` 3",
    "mecs count '' has been used for sources under the 550 micron berillium strongback supporting the mecs window to account for the reduced detector sensitivity .",
    "the histogram of the number of sources as a function of the flux is given in figure [ fxhisto ] .",
    "figure [ sky]a ) gives , for the 175 hellas sources , the count rate as a function of the off - axis angle .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) model line represents the minimum detectable count rate ( at the given threshold of 99.94 % ) for an exposure time of 100 ks in 3 ( 2 ) mecs units .",
    "these lines define the count rate limit ( function of the exposure time and off axis angle ) of the hellas survey .",
    "the shape of the model curves has been adjusted using the latest calibration of the telescope vignetting , mecs background and berillum strongback .",
    "their normalization has been chosen using extensive simulations .",
    "the survey has been simulated assuming a given logn - logs , a distribution of spectral shapes and the positions in detector coordinates of the hellas sources .",
    "the sky coverage of the simulated survey has been computed inverting the model curves .",
    "the normalization of the model curves ( the on - axis flux limits for a 100 ks observation ) , and therefore the sky coverage , were then varied until the input logn - logs was correctly reproduced by the one computed from the simulations .",
    "the adopted value of the on - axis flux limit is @xmath22 ( 3 mecs units ) .",
    "it is @xmath23 and @xmath24 at off - axis angles of 6 and 15 arcmin , respectively .",
    "regions of radius 4 , 6 or 8 arcmin around bright targets have been excluded from the sky coverage and sources detected in these regions have been excluded from the sample .",
    "the exclusion radius has been determined by imposing that the target count rate per square arcmin at a given off - axis radius is less than half of the local mecs background .",
    "sources with a count rate smaller than the minimum value given by the model curves in figure [ sky]a ) normalized to the actual exposure time have also been excluded from the sample .",
    "this brings the total number of sources in the sample used for computing the logn - logs to * 147*. the hellas source catalogue including the source identification number , the j2000.0 coordinates , the 510 kev flux and signal to noise and the count ratios in different energy ranges is reported in table 2 .",
    "the sky coverage computed assuming a power law spectrum with @xmath4 is given in figure [ sky]b ) , thick solid line , and in table 1 ."
