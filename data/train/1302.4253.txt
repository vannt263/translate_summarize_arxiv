    "in this article , we solve the laplace equation in a 1-periodic infinite strip in two space dimensions : @xmath60,1 [ \\times \\rr.\\ ] ] as the domain is infinite in the vertical direction , one introduces weighted sobolev spaces describing the behavior at infinity of the solution .",
    "this behavior is related to weighted sobolev properties of @xmath7 .",
    "the usual weights , when adapted to our problem , are polynomial functions at infinity and regular bounded functions in the neighborhood of the origin : they are powers of @xmath8 and , in some critical cases , higher order derivatives are completed by logarithmic functions ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the literature on the weighted sobolev spaces is wide @xcite and deals with various types of domains . to our knowledge , this type of weights has not been applied to problem .",
    "the choice of the physical domain comes from periodic singular problems : in @xcite , a zoom around a domain s periodic @xmath10-perturbation leads to set an obstacle of size 1 in @xmath11 and to consider a microscopic problem defined on _ a boundary layer_. the behavior at infinity of this _ microscopic _ solution is of importance : it provides an averaged feed - back on the macroscopic scale ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this paper is a first step towards a systematic analysis of such microscopic problems .",

    "since error estimates for boundary layer problems @xcite are mostly performed in the @xmath12 framework we focus here on weighted sobolev spaces @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "there are three types of tools used here : arguments specifically related to weighted sobolev spaces @xcite , variational techniques from the homogenization literature @xcite and some potential theory methods @xcite .",
    "a general scheme might illustrate how these ideas relate one to each other :    * a green function @xmath15 specific to the periodic infinite strip is exhibited for the laplace operator .",

    "a particular attention is provided to give the weakest possible meaning to the latter convolution under minimal requirements on @xmath7 . *",

    "then a lift is built in order to cancel the lineic dirac mass that s introduced by artificial interfaces .",
    "this leads to first isomorphism results . * these arguments",
    "are then applied to weighted derivatives and give natural regularity shift results in @xmath16 for @xmath17 ( see below ) .",
    "* by duality and appropriate use of generalized poincar estimates ( leading to interactions - orthogonality or quotient spaces - with various polynomial families ) , one ends with generic isomorphism result that reads + [ thm.isom.final ] for any @xmath18 and any @xmath19 , the mapping @xmath20 is an isomorphism .",

    "then ( section [ sec.fourier ] ) , we introduce a mixed fourier transform : it is a discrete fourier transform in the horizontal direction and a continuous transform in the vertical direction .",
    "this operator allows the explicit computation of the green function , and we derive weighted and standard estimates of the convolution with this fundamental solution . at this stage , we prove a series of isomorphisms in the non - critical case ( section [ section_laplace ] ) by variational techniques . in the last section ,",
