    "observations of galaxies in the post - reionization epoch ( @xmath8 ) measure the growth of young objects in an early universe . over these redshifts ,",
    "galaxies assemble into the active systems that we observe during the peak of cosmic star - formation at @xmath9 .",
    "these galaxies drive winds , which play a critical role in the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ; @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , observations of galaxies in the post - reionization era provide a baseline for understanding the earliest star formation and reionization of the igm at @xmath10 .",
    "studies of both lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; @xcite ) and ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ; @xcite ) in the post - reionization era provide complementary views of early star formation and galaxy evolution .",
    "the escape of ly@xmath0  photons from the interstellar media of galaxies is strongly influenced by galactic outflows .",
    "typically , observable emission results when photons are redshifted out of resonance with the systemic velocity of the host galaxy @xcite . as a result",
    ", the comparison between laes and lbgs contains information about star formation driven galactic winds .",
    "for example , the space density of uv - luminous galaxies declines with increasing redshift at @xmath8 , while ly@xmath0 luminous galaxies maintain an approximately constant space density @xcite .",
    "the direct implication of these results is that ly@xmath0  photons more readily escape from galaxies at higher redshifts , possibly due to decreasing dust or the increased presence of gaseous outflows .",
    "nevertheless , current conclusions must be drawn from limited data , as narrowband imaging observations leave the faint - end of the ly@xmath0  luminosity function ( lf ) unconstrained .",
    "looking to the end of reionization , it is still debated whether galaxies produced enough ionizing photons to prevent recombination in the igm . it is often argued that galaxies fainter than those present in the deepest _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) surveys are needed to produce enough ionizing photons to balance recombinations in the igm @xcite . because of this requirement for fainter objects , lae surveys at this redshift are useful , as they can identify galaxies that can not be detected by other means . as an example , an lae with @xmath11 erg s@xmath1 and rest - frame equivalent width @xmath12 80   would imply a uv - luminosity of @xmath13  a level too faint to be detected in the hubble ultra deep field @xcite .",
    "identifying very faint laes can shed new light on the ionizing photon budget by including sources with continuum luminosities that have never been probed in the epoch of reionization .",
    "in addition , studies of laes in the post - reionization era are crucial if we aim to determine the neutral hydrogen fraction from ly@xmath0  emission .",
    "measurements of ly@xmath0  equivalent widths , line profiles , clustering , and the lf will all be impacted by neutral hydrogen @xcite , but quantifying these effects will require robust measurements in the post - reionization era for comparison . because galaxies in a partially neutral igm are thought to reside in bubbles ionized by their own star - formation , luminosity dependent trends are expected @xcite . by measuring only bright laes , narrowband imaging provides an incomplete view of these star - forming galaxies .",
    "clearly , samples of faint laes are required to better understand galaxies and the igm at @xmath14 . to detect these objects , _ spectroscopic _ searches are necessary to increase the contrast with the sky background .",
    "blind spectroscopic searches for laes have now successfully identified galaxies at @xmath15 ( @xcite , hereafter paper i , @xcite ) . in dressler et al .",
    "( 2011 , hereafter paper ii ) we presented first results from a new multislit narrowband spectroscopic ( mns ) survey for laes at @xmath16 . in this search",
    ", we reached unprecedented depths and detected 215 lae candidates .",
    "the faintest objects , if they are confirmed , will have luminosities that have only been seen ( at this redshift ) in a few lensed galaxies @xcite . only 31 ( 14% )",
    "the lae candidates in paper ii  have fluxes bright enough to be selected through narrowband imaging ( @xmath17 erg s@xmath1 @xmath18 ) .    in paper ii",
    ", we presented evidence that a high fraction of the lae candidates are indeed laes , but spectroscopic confirmation is still required . in the present paper , we analyze the first results from our spectroscopic followup campaign . with a new sample of confirmed laes in hand",
    ", we provide the first measurement of the faint - end slope of the ly@xmath0  lf at redshift 5.7 .",
    "we demonstrate that slit - losses can be robustly accounted for in blind - spectroscopic data by using monte carlo simulations within the framework of the maximum likelihood method .",
    "in fact , as we show in  [ lyalf_mle ] , this method is directly applicable to narrowband imaging data , where uncertainties often result from a non - uniform narrowband throughput .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ survey ] we give a brief overview of the survey design . in ",
    "3 we present our spectroscopic followup observations , and in  4 we discuss the newly identified laes .",
    "these laes are used , in  5 , to infer the number of laes that should remain in our sample , and in  6 we derive the ly@xmath0  lf by combining our data with those from the subaru deep field ( sdf ) and cosmos @xcite .",
    "prospects for improving the parameter constraints are discussed in  7 .",
    "the implications of this work , including comparisons to other measurements , and a discussion of lae properties can be found in  8 .",
    "survey completeness is described in appendix a. finally , in appendix b we examine the foreground ( @xmath19 ) emission line galaxies and update our model for the interloper fraction that we previously presented in paper ii .    throughout this paper",

    "all volumes are given in comoving units , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the lae candidates that we aim to confirm in this paper are selected from our spectroscopic survey , which is presented fully in paper ii . in summary",
    ", the search uses the inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ; @xcite ) on the magellan - baade telescope . to obtain blind , narrowband spectra we use a `` venetian blind '' slit - mask ( see figure 2 of paper i  for a schematic ) and a 134  - wide ( fwhm ) blocking filter centered in the 8200  oh - free atmospheric window .",
    "the slits on this mask cover an area of 55 arcmin@xmath24 , corresponding to a volume of 1.5@xmath25 mpc@xmath26 for ly@xmath0  at redshift 5.7 .",
    "emission lines that are detected are as faint as 2.5@xmath27 erg s@xmath1 @xmath18 .",
    "two fields were surveyed : one in the center of the cosmos field @xcite , and the other in the las campanas infrared survey ( lcirs ) 15h field @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the cosmos field , as the 15h field has only limited spectroscopic followup at this time",
    ". a more complete luminosity function , with data from both fields combined , will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "we identified 105 lae candidates in the imacs search of the cosmos field .",
    "these objects are seen as single emission lines with no detected continuum ( or , in a few cases , a possible weak continuum detection only to the red of the line ) .",
    "an additional 130 objects with blue continuum or multiple emission lines  and [ ] @xmath286583  , or [ ]   @xmath294959 , 5007  . ] were identified as foreground galaxies in the search data .",
    "identifying the lae candidates as genuine laes or foreground galaxies is not trivial .",
    "since the positions of galaxies within the slits are not known , a large area on the sky must be searched for an optical counterpart . as a result ,",
    "the normal approach of requiring an optical non - detection to distinguish foreground galaxies from laes is not applicable .",
    "this ambiguity is illustrated in figure [ stamps_array ] , which shows broadband and narrowband thumbnail images of our six confirmed laes ( which we will discuss in  [ confirmed_sec ] ) . in most cases",
    "there are no objects falling within the slits at the spatial position of the laes , but in some cases there are objects nearby or outside the slits .",
    "similarly , only 37 of the 105 lae candidates have entries within a 2  radius in the cosmos photometric redshift catalog . of these , 20 have photometric redshifts that place an emission line in our 8200  bandpass and 17 do not .",
    "clearly , the faintness of our lae candidates means that spectroscopic followup is required to determine if the detected emission line is ly@xmath0 , or an emission line from a foreground galaxy . under this approach",
    ", we can detect other emission lines that identify the galaxies as foreground emitters , and also observe the `` smoking gun '' signature of ly@xmath0  emission : an asymmetric line profile . in the sections below",
    "we describe our spectroscopic followup observations .",
    "the slits used to observe lae candidates always have the same width , coordinates , and position angle ( pa ) as the search slits , regardless of potential optical counterparts .",

    "a slit width of 1.5  was used to match the 2008 search observations , and the 200 line mm@xmath1 grating provided a 2   pixel@xmath1 scale to go along with the 0.2  pixel@xmath1 scale of the imacs f/2 camera .",
    "the full spectral range covered approximately 4000 - 9000  .",
    "the data were reduced using the cosmos ( carnegie observatories system for multi object spectroscopy ) software package .",
    "these spectra allowed us to identify h@xmath0 , [ ] , and h@xmath30  emission from galaxies .",
    "however , at this",
    "s / n and resolution neither the [ ]  doublet nor the ly@xmath0  line profile can be resolved .",
    "therefore , both [ ]  and ly@xmath0  emitters appear as single emission lines in our imacs followup spectroscopy .",
    "these single line objects are prioritized for higher - resolution spectroscopic followup with deimos ( see below ) .",
    "medium resolution followup spectroscopy with deimos @xcite on keck ii was carried out on march 7 - 8 , 2010 and january 27 - 28 , 2011 .",
    "further observations scheduled march 3 - 4 2011 were lost entirely to poor weather .",
    "in addition to the high - priority single line emitters from our imacs followup , the slit - masks included lae candidates which were not targeted for imacs followup , and those that were targeted but not recovered .",
    "( ultimately , it was not unusual for objects that we failed to recover in imacs followup to be robustly detected under good conditions with deimos . )",
    "the observing conditions and mask positions are listed in table [ obstable ] . in the 2010 observations ,",
    "poor seeing impeded our ability to recover the faintest sources and to distinguish [ ]  from ly@xmath0  in low s / n emission line detections .",
    "consequently , the optimal mask design in 2011 included substantial overlap with the previous year .",
    "two laes identified on the march 2010 mask a ( 51.5 - 1 - 0.98 and 59.5 + 5 - 0.75 ) were also included on mask d in 2011 .",
    "observations were made with the 830 g grating , using slit - widths , position angles , and locations matched to the search data .",
    "the data were reduced using the deep2 deimos data pipelinecooper / deep / spec2d ] , with an updated optical model for the 830 g grating ( p. capak , private communication ) .",
    "the january 2011 data were flux calibrated using observations of spectrophotometric standard stars , taken through a 1.5  slit at the parallactic angle .",
    "the stars used were g191b2b , gd50 , feige 66 , feige 67 , and hz 44 @xcite , with reference data taken from the eso spectrophotometric standard star database .",
    "sensitivity functions derived from each of these stars agree to within 12% , and when feige 66 is excluded agreement is better than 3% .",
    "in addition to the default pipeline extraction , the january 2011 spectra are extracted in 18 apertures .",
    "this aperture size was chosen to match the spatial extraction in paper ii , and is appropriate given the good seeing in both the search data and january 2011 followup .",
    "no flux calibration was applied to the march 2010 data because variable seeing , at times larger than 2 , and cirrus during some of the observations , implied significant count - rate differences from frame to frame .",
    "line fluxes were measured from the extracted january 2011 spectra , and compared to the fluxes measured from the imacs search data ( and used in paper ii ) .",
    "the root mean square deviation is approximately 50% , even for bright sources .",
    "this scatter likely results from the fact that the lae candidates are not necessarily centered in the slits , so small astrometric errors or different seeing will induce varied slit - losses from one observation to the next . in ",
    "[ lyalf ] we take this scatter into account when we derive the luminosity function .",
    "for consistency , all line fluxes in this paper are taken from the search data .",
    "six laes are identified from the deimos observations .",

    "we show three cases of high quality ly@xmath0  spectra , where the asymmetric line profile makes the identification unambiguous .",
    "little discussion is needed for these three laes , although we do note that the two brightest laes 51.5 - 1 - 0.98 and 59.5 + 5 - 0.75 are clearly spatially resolved on mask d , where they were observed under 06 seeing .    when an emission line is not clearly asymmetric , more care is needed to determine if it is ly@xmath0 .",

    "while deimos is efficient at 8000 , it is about a factor of two less sensitive at blue wavelengths where we would detect [ ]  from an h@xmath0  emitter or [ ]  from an [ ]  emitter .",

    "if the detected emission is ultimately confirmed to be ly@xmath0 , we may have observed a fainter companion galaxy .",
    "however , the bluer foreground galaxy lying near the center of the thumbnail image is more closely aligned with the detected emission , but its redshift is uncertain . due to its faintness , this galaxy is not included in the cosmos photometric redshift catalog .    in summary ,",
    "we find three certain laes with clear asymmetric profiles and three plausible laes , where the blue sensitivity of our followup spectroscopy is insufficient to rule out all cases of h@xmath0  and [ ]  @xmath285007 . in the sections that follow we derive ly@xmath0  lfs for two cases : the `` 3 lae lf , '' where only the robustly identified laes are included , and also the `` 6 lae lf '' , where both the robust and plausible laes are included .",

    "having outlined the steps needed to derive the best - fitting schechter parameters , we next implement this method for both our spectroscopic data and bright - end data taken from the cosmos and the sdf narrowband imaging surveys .",

    ", we find the @xmath0 , @xmath86 and @xmath91 that maximize equation [ lthree ] .",

    "however , two of the securely identified laes are clearly resolved in the deimos followup observations , so we consider the impact of size .    because our sample is too small at this time to adopt an empirically motivated size distribution ,",
    "we consider three cases to illustrate the effect of lae sizes .",
    "we assume constant sizes of 05 , 075 , and 10 ( observed fwhm ) , and derive lae parameter constraints ( by the method described below ) .",

    "we adopt the intermediate case where all laes have observed fwhm = @xmath99  in the imacs search data .    with these assumptions ,",
    "we determine @xmath84 by a monte carlo simulation where laes are randomly placed inside and near the slits , and noise is added .",
    "we consider an intrinsic luminosity range of @xmath100 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the lowest simulated luminosity is fainter than the limit of our search , so this allows for photometric scatter into our selection .",
    "the high - luminosity cutoff is arbitrary , but is justified since the volume density of laes becomes vanishingly small at this luminosity @xcite .",
    "this high@xmath101 cutoff determines the maximum distance from slit - center where laes are placed . a galaxy with @xmath102 erg s@xmath1 and a size of 0.75  ( fwhm )",
    "can present detectable line flux even from a distance of 1.7  from the slit - center .",
    "therefore , for the blind spectroscopy , the volume used in equation [ npred ] is 3.4@xmath25 mpc@xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath84 describes the probability of a galaxy with luminosity @xmath78 being observed in our survey , it is appropriate to include survey completeness in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "this takes two forms .",
    "first , the detection incompleteness , which is derived in appendix [ comp_app ] , is included .",
    "additionally , since we are deriving lfs from inferred counts , we include a redshift identification incompleteness defined as the ratio of the confirmed laes ( columns four and five ) to the inferred laes ( columns eleven and twelve ) in table [ rates ] .",
    "the bin with zero inferred laes is assigned a spectroscopic completeness of zero .",
    "figure [ ptrans_fig ] shows @xmath84 with the spectroscopic incompleteness included for the six - lae case .",
    "the left panel shows that , in this two dimensional space , the probability is peaked on the diagonal because the most likely true luminosity , @xmath78 , is the one that we observe , @xmath77 .",
    "however , a tail of galaxies with high @xmath78 and low observed @xmath77 are also present when galaxies fall partly outside of a slit . on the left - hand side of this two dimensional space , at @xmath103 erg s@xmath1 ,",
    "the spectroscopic incompleteness is apparent .",
    "the right panel of figure [ ptrans_fig ] shows a vertical slice of the left panel to illustrate the fraction of galaxies at each @xmath104 that are detected with @xmath105 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "because of photometric scatter , there is a significant probability of a galaxy having a fainter true luminosity , @xmath78 , than is observed .",
    "it is worth noting that , if a set of schechter parameters are assumed , we can use this slice in equation [ transphi ] to get @xmath106 .      to calculate @xmath84 for the narrowband imaging samples , we must take two scenarios into consideration : when the redshifts of the emission lines are known , as they are for most ( but not all ) of the sdf laes , and when the redshifts are unknown , as is the case for the cosmos narrowband imaging sample .",
    "when redshifts are unknown , emission lines with some @xmath78 are placed randomly at wavelengths between 8050   and 8250  . therefore ,",
    "the appropriate volumes used in equation [ npred ] are @xmath107 mpc@xmath26 for the sdf and @xmath108 mpc@xmath26 for cosmos .",
    "additionally , a normally distributed flux error is added , with @xmath109 erg s@xmath1 @xmath18   for the sdf and cosmos simulations .    as with the blind spectroscopic data",
    ", these monte carlo simulations include detection completeness .",
    "while the cosmos narrowband imaging sample is assumed to be complete at @xmath110 erg s@xmath1 , the sdf data must be corrected .",
    "although the incompleteness for this sample is a function of the nb816 magnitude , it varies slowly from 75 - 90% over the range that we are interested .",
    "furthermore , the line luminosity forms a fairly tight correlation with the nb816 magnitude , with an rms scatter of 0.1 dex .",
    "therefore , at each luminosity we adopt a completeness appropriate for the mean nb816 magnitude of galaxies with that luminosity .",
    "when the redshifts of the emission lines are known , a different set of kernels is used in equation [ maxlike_best ] . in this case , the simulation differs from the case of unknown redshifts , because the observed @xmath77 have been corrected for the transmission through the filter curve shown in figure [ filters ] .",
    "therefore , in this simulation there is no scatter between @xmath78 and @xmath77 from the unknown filter throughput . in the absence of noise",
    ", these kernels would be a set of @xmath111-functions .",
    "however , as with the case of unknown redshifts , noise and detection incompleteness are included .",
    "for the purposes of determining the normalization , we adopt the scenario used for unknown redshifts in equation [ npred ] for all sdf laes .      with the various @xmath84 in hand , we evaluate equation [ lthree ] for each survey , over a grid of @xmath0 , @xmath92 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the final likelihood function is given by the product of the individual likelihood functions , @xmath113 , for each survey .",

    "one feature of maximum likelihood parameter estimation is that the most likely model does not always run through the data points .",
    "this is indeed the case in figure [ lfs_with_fits ] .",
    "the discrete points describing the cosmos laes are derived by assuming that all objects are observed through the peak of the nb816 throughput curve .",
    "consequently , on average , the true luminosities , @xmath78 , of these laes will be brighter than what we have observed .",
    "since we model these effects with our maximum likelihood estimation , we expect the schechter functions plotted in figure [ lfs_with_fits ] to fall above the discrete data points for the cosmos narrowband imaging data . on the other hand ,",
    "since we have taken the bandpass into account for the 85% of the sdf laes that are spectroscopically confirmed , we expect the most likely schechter function to closely follow the discrete sdf points in figure [ lfs_with_fits ] .",
    "in fact , if we exclude the sdf data from our fit , the bright - end of the best - fit schechter function falls close to the same location , approximately 0.05 dex brighter than the cosmos narrowband imaging points shown in figures [ lf_bins ] and [ lfs_with_fits ] .",
    "correcting these points in figures [ lf_bins ] and [ lfs_with_fits ] for this average attenuation , would bring them in line with the sdf data and the schechter function fit .",
    "figure [ contours ] shows the 68% and 95% confidence intervals for these parameter constraints .",
    "clearly , owing to our small sample of faint laes , a large range of acceptable faint - end slopes can describe our data .",
    "however , as our spectroscopic followup becomes more complete , the luminosity function parameters will be more tightly constrained .",
    "it is not surprising that the luminosity function parameter constraints which we show in figure [ contours ] allow a wide range of schechter parameters . at this time",
    "the faint - end of our lf is based on only a few confirmed laes .",
    "our continued efforts at followup spectroscopy will narrow the allowed parameter space by increasing the sample size .",
    "furthermore , the addition of our 15h field , when spectroscopy is complete , will approximately double the number of laes over what is present in the cosmos field .",
    "it is therefore of interest to address how strict the constraints from our survey may ultimately prove . to explore this",
    ", we create a mock catalog of galaxies with @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath5 ( our 6 lae lf in table [ bestfits ] and the contour curves in figure [ contours ] ) .",
    "these galaxies are distributed throughout the volume of _ both _ our cosmos and 15h imacs fields , out to 1.7  from slit - center , similar to the monte - carlo simulations in  [ lyalf_mle ] .",
    "slit - losses , noise , and detection completeness are included .",
    "finally , we assume a spectroscopic completeness of 90% at all luminosities , since achieving 100% completeness is usually impractical .",
    "the resulting sample of laes in both fields is approximately 40 galaxies . after regenerating the convolution kernels to include the appropriate spectroscopic completeness",
    ", we calculate the likelihood function , @xmath96 over the grid of @xmath122 ( leaving the bright - end data unchanged ) .",
    "contours shown in figure [ contours_future1 ] illustrate the improvements in the constraints that we can expect to find from completing our spectroscopic followup .",
    "for the increased sample size in this simulation , the 68% confidence interval on the faint - end slope is reduced by 50% .",
    "likewise , under our current constraints , the space density of laes at @xmath123 erg s@xmath1 spans a factor of 10 ( 68% confidence ) , but should be decreased to less than a factor of three when both fields are 90% complete .",
    "in figure [ lfs_with_fits ] we compare the lfs derived in this work to those presented in previous studies at redshift 5.7 .",
    "a number of items are readily evident .",
    "first , the shape ( @xmath91 and @xmath86 ) of the lf that we derive from the sdf data is different from the shape obtained by @xcite , _ from the same bright - end data_. this variation is not surprising , given our different analysis .",
    "most notably , we have adopted luminosities calculated from the nb816 and @xmath60-band magnitudes , whereas kashikawa et al .",
    "use luminosities derived from their followup spectroscopy . given the uncertainties associated with estimating slit - losses",
    ", imaging - based measurements may be a better approximation to the total ly@xmath0  luminosity provided that aperture magnitudes are corrected to total magnitudes , and the redshifts are used to calculate the true luminosity observed through the nb816 filter .",
    "figure [ lfs_with_fits ] also compares our bright - end lf derivation with the similar redshift 5.7 ly@xmath0  lf from the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ; @xcite ) .",
    "while the agreement between the plotted schechter functions is good , this may be fortuitous .",
    "limited spectroscopic followup in the sxds could allow significant contamination , since narrowband imaging can sometimes select lae candidates which have no line emission at all .",
    "this point is illustrated clearly in the color magnitude plots used to select lae candidates ( figure 7 in @xcite ; figure 1 in @xcite ; figure 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "when the limit of the nb816 photometry is approached , there is significant scatter about the threshold that defines an emission line source .",
    "while the use of optical `` veto '' bands will eliminate some spurious emission line candidates , even this method could break down for faint galaxies , where modestly red galaxy seds may be undetected at bluer wavelengths .",
    "this contamination may account for the laes which @xcite do not detect in followup spectroscopy .",
    "likewise , the faintest _ confirmed _ laes in the sxds @xcite are about one magnitude brighter in nb816 than the limit of that sample .",
    "more spectroscopic followup will be needed to determine the reliability of the fainter ly@xmath0  candidates selected from narrowband imaging .",
    "such observations would provide better constraints on the space density of laes at luminosities around the knee of the lf , and reduce the covariances shown in figures [ contours ] and [ contours_future1 ] .",
    "two other measurements deviate from the lf that we derive here : @xcite , and paper i. these bright and intermediate luminosity data would require a discontinuity from our new faint - end results .",
    "a schechter function can not be fit which simultaneously goes through these data and our new data .",
    "therefore , it is clear that both the paper i  and hu et al .",
    "samples are incomplete .",
    "indeed , incompleteness in the hu et al .",
    "result is discussed in @xcite . because hu et al .",
    "require spectroscopic confirmation , but use shorter observations than kashikawa et al .",
    ", it is argued that the incompleteness is simply a failure to re - detect some real laes . on the other hand , for our pilot survey , comparison of our current completeness to the detection completeness derived in paper",
    "i  suggests that the prior estimate was overly optimistic . for the current data , near 100% completeness",
    "is reached for detections of better than 10@xmath124 significance .",
    "shifting the completeness curve for the present data ( appendix [ comp_app ] ) by a factor of four to five in flux allows us to revise the completeness estimate used for the shallower data in paper i. this exercise suggests that our previous lf was 30 - 70% complete , rather than near 100% , as was assumed . revising these completeness corrections would bring the paper i  points more closely in line with our new lf and the @xcite result .    in paper ii",
    ", our analysis of the foreground populations suggested that the remaining counts of laes followed a similar faint - end slope , with @xmath125 . with our followup spectroscopy",
    ", we now find that the most likely slope is slightly shallower , although @xmath126 is well within the 1@xmath124 measurement uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , we identify the source of this difference ( for the cosmos field ) in appendix [ fgsec ] .",
    "briefly , the foreground emission line galaxies that we have identified so far in our followup add up to the counts predicted by the foreground model adopted in paper ii .",
    "since we expect that a significant fraction of the unidentified emission lines listed in table [ counts1 ] are also foreground objects , we expect these counts to be higher than the most likely model adopted in paper ii .",
    "because of this , the fraction of laes among our detected emission lines will be smaller than we previously estimated in paper ii . as we show in appendix [ fgsec ] ,",
    "the most likely cause of this underestimation is a strong presence of h@xmath30  emitters from an overdensity at @xmath127 in the cosmos field .",
    "finally , we note that the cosmic variance for our faint lae sample , at this time , makes a negligible contribution to the error budget because the poisson errors on our small sample are much larger than the cosmic variance . on the other hand , at the bright end , the excellent agreement between the narrowband imaging samples from cosmos , the sdf , and the sxds is better than the approximately 20 - 30% cosmic variance that we expect for these surveys @xcite .",
    "so far , we have compared our ly@xmath0  lf to previously measured ly@xmath0  lfs at redshift 5.7 . by necessity , this discussion focussed on the bright - end data , since no faint - end measurements existed prior to the one which we present here . in this section",
    ", we turn to lower - redshift spectroscopic surveys which measure laes to very faint luminosities at @xmath128 . in figure",
    "[ cf_faint ] , we show three measurements of the cumulative ly@xmath0  luminosity function .",

    "the highest space density of laes is found by @xcite , who also have the greatest sensitivity to low surface brightness emission .",

    "while some evidence exists for bluer slopes at the highest redshifts @xcite , these claims are disputed ( @xcite ; see also , @xcite ) . until more conclusive evidence for bluer slopes is found ,",

    "likewise , at the @xmath136 erg s@xmath1 limit of our survey , a galaxy would need to have a rest equivalent width smaller than about 80   to have a continuum flux - density which is bright enough for inclusion in the @xmath48dropout sample .    of course , assessing whether lae surveys are finding a significant population of previously unobserved galaxies is not straightforward .",
    "the ly@xmath0  equivalent width of star - forming galaxies displays a wide range of values , with a tail to quantities larger than @xmath137   @xcite .",
    "consequently , a faint lae could be the result of a low equivalent width emission from a uv - bright galaxy , or conversely , high equivalent width emission from an extremely faint galaxy .",
    "no obvious trends exist between ly@xmath0  luminosity and equivalent width ( see @xcite ) , although followup of uv - continuum selected @xmath48dropouts shows that fainter continuum is correlated with stronger and more common ly@xmath0  emission @xcite .",
    "ultimately , since ly@xmath0  equivalent width exhibits such a wide range of values , a statistical comparison with the ensemble of @xmath48 dropout galaxies is most relevant .    to determine whether the laes in our sample are likely to be detectable as faint @xmath48 dropouts , we generate a mock catalog of galaxies . beginning with the uv - luminosity function of @xmath6 @xmath48 dropouts ( @xcite ; @xmath138 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 )",
    ", we generate a sample of galaxies in a fixed volume , with uv - luminosities extending to @xmath141 ( beyond the depth required for all laes in our survey to be detected in the continuum ) . a rest - frame ly@xmath0  equivalent width ( @xmath134 )",
    "is assigned to each galaxy in this volume , drawing from an exponential distribution with a maximum of @xmath142  .",
    "motivated by the observations shown in stark et al .",
    "( 2011 ; figure 2 ) , we adopt e - folding , or `` characteristic '' equivalent widths of 50    for @xmath143 , and 20   for @xmath144 .",
    "these scale factors approximately reproduce the distribution of rest equivalent widths and the fraction of sources with equivalent width less than 25  .",
    "since narrowband imaging surveys can not detect laes with @xmath145  , galaxies which are given these low equivalent widths under our exponential parameterization are excluded from the ly@xmath0  lf .",
    "( although we note that the ly@xmath0  lf is not strongly dependent upon this cutoff . ) with each galaxy assigned an @xmath146 and @xmath134 , we calculate the ly@xmath0  luminosity of each @xmath48dropout . to understand the impact of the current observational limit , we repeat this calculation including only galaxies brighter than @xmath147 . the resulting simulated lfs",
    "are plotted in figure [ lfsims ] , where they are compared to our measured constraints on the ly@xmath0  lf .",
    "the simulated lfs shown in figure [ lfsims ] illustrate the importance of surveys for faint laes . with the equivalent width distributions chosen above",
    ", the ly@xmath0  lf simulated with only galaxies having @xmath148 ( dashed curve ) shows a significant deficit of laes relative to when the complete range of luminosities are included ( solid curve ) . at the @xmath11 erg s@xmath1 limit of our survey",
    ", approximately 50% of laes should have @xmath135 .",
    "galaxies as faint as @xmath149 are needed to bring these two simulated lfs into agreement .",
    "_ this result clearly indicates that we have uncovered a population of galaxies whose continua are too faint to have been observed in the deepest space - based dropout surveys .",
    "_ on the other hand , the narrowband imaging surveys for brighter laes are not uncovering a previously unobserved population .",
    "figure [ lfsims ] shows that , brighter than @xmath150 erg s@xmath1 , the ly@xmath0  luminosity function is dominated by galaxies with @xmath151 .",
    "figure [ lfsims ] shows that the simulated ly@xmath0  luminosity function falls short of observations at the bright end .",
    "a scale factor of 30   rather than 20   for the bright ( @xmath144 ) @xmath48 dropouts would bring the simulated luminosity function within the 68% confidence interval shown in figure [ lfsims ] .",
    "a larger scale factor is not implausible , as the sample of bright @xmath48dropouts targeted for spectroscopy by @xcite is not large enough to derive very precise constraints on the luminosity dependence of the ly@xmath0  equivalent width distribution .",
    "additionally , it should be noted that the equivalent width distributions measured by @xcite are for galaxies that are _ selected _ as @xmath48dropouts . the selection function for these galaxies",
    "is known to depend on ly@xmath0  equivalent widths @xcite , so the `` raw '' equivalent width distributions presented by stark et al .",
    "may not strictly represent the parent population of star - forming galaxies .",
    "one way to interpret the ( incomplete ) simulated ly@xmath0  luminosity function of galaxies with @xmath152 is as a prediction of the ly@xmath0  lf that one could measure from spectroscopic followup of @xmath48dropout galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , correcting this lf to the `` true '' ly@xmath0  lf of all galaxies is not possible .",
    "we could speculate that the characteristic equivalent widths may be larger for galaxies with @xmath135 ( following the trend of more prevalent ly@xmath0  emission among galaxies with fainter uv continuum luminosities ) . under this scenario ,",
    "the discrepancy between the simulated lfs shown in figure [ lfsims ] would be amplified , because the faint - end slope of the `` true '' lf ( simulated to a realistic low - luminosity cutoff ) would be even steeper . since we can not know the equivalent width distribution of the faint , continuum - undetected galaxies",
    ", only dedicated emission line surveys will be able to measure the faint - end slope of the ly@xmath0  lf .",
    "the transmission of ly@xmath0  photons is sensitive to the ionization state of the igm , so the shape of the ly@xmath0  emission line profile may offer a measure of the changing neutral hydrogen fraction . in a more neutral igm , the gunn - peterson ly@xmath0  damping - wing will lower the peak flux of the line , effectively broadening the emission and removing its asymmetric shape @xcite .",
    "observational efforts have begun to search for a difference in ly@xmath0  profiles observed at redshifts 5.7 and 6.5 @xcite , but the average line width is not significantly different between the two redshift bins .",
    "however , hu et al . show that the ly@xmath0  line width displays a positive correlation with luminosity . in figure [ lineprof_fig ]",
    "we combine our faint laes with the hu et al .",
    "redshift 5.7 sample to extend the correlation to lower luminosities .",
    "as expected from an extrapolation of the brighter sources , our newly measured line widths are among the narrower values .",
    "the significance of the relation is improved : under the spearman rank correlation test , the probability of the null hypothesis ( no correlation ) is decreased from @xmath153 to @xmath154 when our six faint laes are included .",
    "these probabilities , interpreted in the context of a gaussian probability density function , increase the significance of the correlation from 3@xmath124 to better than 3.5@xmath124 .",
    "the luminosity dependence of the ly@xmath0  line - width has important implications for how the effects of reionization on the line profile are interpreted .",
    "comparisons made at different redshifts should also be made at fixed luminosity .",
    "this luminosity dependence has not been accounted for when entire samples of redshift 5.7 and 6.5 laes have been stacked @xcite . in a flux - limited sample ,",
    "the redshift 6.5 laes will be , on average , more luminous .",
    "this could explain the observation that the redshift 6.5 line profiles are marginally broader than those at redshift 5.7 .",
    "the origins of the observed luminosity dependence are unclear .",
    "one explanation offered by @xcite is that the more luminous laes may simply be more massive , with intrinsically broader ly@xmath0  lines .",
    "another possibility lies in the kinematics and conditions of the circumgalactic medium .",
    "while typical star - forming galaxies have redshifted ly@xmath0  emission and blueshifted p - cygni absorption @xcite , rare cases are seen where blueshifted material emits rather than absorbs ly@xmath0  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the ly@xmath0  emission is both luminous , and broader than average .",
    "while gunn - peterson absorption will destroy blueshifted emission at redshift 5.7 , the relative strength of the emission component at zero velocity may still induce a correlation between line width and luminosity .",
    "measurements of lae masses and systemic redshifts can distinguish these scenarios , but for reionization era galaxies , the required observations will remain challenging until the _ james webb space telescope _ operates .      at @xmath6",
    "the reionization of the intergalactic medium was complete , and the neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm was negligible .",
    "star - forming galaxies are usually assumed to produce the necessary ionizing background to prevent hydrogen recombination . however , observational constraints at redshifts 6 and higher have yet to demonstrate that galaxies produce the requisite ionizing background @xcite .",
    "often , galaxies which are too faint to be observed are invoked @xcite , extrapolating faint counts from brighter populations . in this paper",
    ", we address this shortcoming by detecting some objects from this hitherto undetected , postulated faint population ( as demonstrated in  [ lfsim_sec ] ) .",
    "in figure [ reion_fig ] we show the cumulative ly@xmath0  luminosity density ( as a function of the low - luminosity cutoff ) allowed by our newly derived constraints . in order to determine whether laes can maintain an ionized igm",
    ", we must infer an ionizing photon rate from the observed ly@xmath0  photons , and then address whether this ionization rate can balance the recombination rate in the igm .",
    "this threshold depends on the escape of both ly@xmath0  and hydrogen - ionizing ( lyc ) photons ( @xmath155 and @xmath156 ; @xcite ) , as well as the clumpiness of ionized hydrogen in the igm ( @xmath157 ) . in paper",
    "i  and paper ii  we renormalized these uncertain parameters to their best guess values and grouped them into a single parameter , @xmath158 .",
    "in this way , @xmath159 when @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 , and the critical ly@xmath0  luminosity density required to maintain an ionized igm at redshift 5.7 is @xmath163 erg s@xmath1 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "thresholds with @xmath158 = 0.1 , 0.5 , and 1.0 are shown in figure [ reion_fig ] .",
    "this plot illustrates that , if @xmath158 is among the smaller values of 0.1 to 0.5 , it may be possible to maintain an ionized igm with only the galaxies that we have observed .",
    "however , if @xmath158 is larger , even fainter galaxies are needed _ and _ the faint - end slope must fall among the steeper values allowed by our data . as we pointed out in paper ii ,",
    "when faint - end slopes are shallow ( @xmath164 ) , the ly@xmath0  luminosity density grows very slowly when increasingly lower luminosities are included .",
    "therefore , in the case of a shallow slope , it may be difficult for star - forming galaxies to reionize the igm .",
    "in paper ii  we compared our density of faint laes to that of local galaxies , estimating that we had found three or four sites of active star - formation per @xmath86 galaxy today .",
    "the implication of this result was that we had identified the building blocks of milky - way type galaxies .",
    "in this work , we have refined our faint - end slope measurements , and shown that the most - likely slope is shallower than the one we adopted in paper ii . as a result ,",
    "the space density of laes that we have identified is about a factor of two smaller @xmath165 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "however , not all galaxies have ly@xmath0  emission . by comparison ,",
    "the space density of observed @xmath48dropouts is about 2 - 3 times higher than the lae density that we observe .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath48dropouts were detected as faint as @xmath166 ( our estimate of our faintest continuum luminosities from  [ lfsim_sec ] ) , their space density would be several times higher than the lae density presented here .",
    "since our laes belong to this class of postulated ultra - faint @xmath48dropouts , we can infer that we have observed the building blocks of present day @xmath86 galaxies .    while it remains difficult to determine the physical properties of laes from their ly@xmath0  emission line alone , in paper ii  we placed their properties in the larger context by comparison to other studies .",
    "for example , the angular correlation of the brighter laes presented in @xcite implies halo masses of @xmath167 at redshift 5.7 .",
    "presumably , the lower luminosity objects that we have found reside in less massive halos .",
    "additionally , in paper i  we estimated sfrs as low as 1 to a few @xmath168 yr@xmath1 ( if half of the ly@xmath0  photons escape the galaxy ) . if this star formation rate persists for a dynamical time scale of at least 50 myr , then approximately @xmath169 @xmath168 of stars will have formed .",
    "these masses , sfrs , and redshifts are well matched to the predicted properties of the galaxies that enriched the igm with metals @xcite .    as noted in ",
    "[ confirmed_sec ] , some of the laes have spatially resolved emission in our deimos spectroscopy . this is not strictly surprising , as stacking of narrowband ly@xmath0  images at @xmath170 has revealed that diffuse , extended ly@xmath0  emission is a generic component laes and lbgs alike @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite find that , when exceptionally faint surface brightness limits are reached , a considerable fraction ( 40 - 70% ) of redshift 3 laes are extended .",
    "consequently , the observation that laes are compact in narrowband hst images @xcite does not imply that the ly@xmath0  emission region is small , but rather that the sensitivity to low surface brightness emission is insufficient in the space - based images .",
    "further studies of extended ly@xmath0  emission in larger samples may help quantify the evolution of the circumgalactic medium at high - redshift .",
    "we have measured the faint - end slope of the ly@xmath0  luminosity function at redshift 5.7 , using multi - slit narrowband spectroscopy ( mns ) to identify faint emission lines . in paper",
    "ii  @xcite , we presented over 200 ly@xmath0  candidates and showed that a steep faint - end slope ( @xmath171 ) was likely .",
    "now , we have added spectroscopic followup to distinguish foreground line emitters and confirm laes . in this way ,",
    "we have conclusively identified three , and tentatively identified three further laes . with these laes in hand",
    ", we develop the appropriate framework for deriving a luminosity function from blind - spectroscopic data , where the positions of galaxies within the search slit are not always known .",
    "the resulting ly@xmath0  lf has a faint - end slope of @xmath119 ( @xmath116 ) when six ( three ) laes are used .",
    "when our spectroscopic followup in cosmos and the lcirs 15h field is complete , we can expect to identify around 40 laes , and improve the uncertainties on the lf measurements .",
    "studies of galaxies in the post - reionization era ( @xmath8 ) allow us to map the growth of young objects in an early universe .",
    "for the laes in our survey , we estimate sfrs of one to a few @xmath168 yr@xmath1 , and a stellar mass of at least @xmath169 m@xmath172 .",
    "in fact , these properties are matched to the masses , sfrs , and redshifts of galaxies that are thought to have enriched the igm with metals @xcite .    by identifying some of the faintest galaxies",
    "ever observed at @xmath6 , we uncover objects that are important for the reionization of the igm . in  [ reion_sec ] , we show that by extrapolating our faint - end slope measurement to low luminosities , it may be possible for laes to maintain an ionized igm with our nominal assumptions about the escape fractions of lyc and ly@xmath0  photons ( @xmath173 and @xmath174 ) and the clumpiness of the ionized hydrogen in the igm ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the allowed ly@xmath0  luminosity density of sources brighter than @xmath175 erg s@xmath1 spans more than an order of magnitude .",
    "if the true value falls among the lower range allowed by our data , the escape fractions and clumping factor may need to be revised in order for galaxies to maintain an ionized igm . ultimately , this requirement may prove reasonable the escape fractions and clumping factor are all uncertain .",
    "future efforts to constrain these parameters , in parallel with improved measurements of galaxies will be needed if we are to conclusively determine , whether star - formation at @xmath6 maintains the ionized igm .",
    "the laes presented here set a benchmark for comparison to higher redshift ly@xmath0  surveys that aim to measure the reionization of the igm . by combining our line width measurements with those reported by @xcite , we confirm that fainter laes have somewhat narrower line widths .",
    "although the origin of this correlation is unclear , it must be taken into consideration when drawing conclusions about a ( partially ) neutral igm from ly@xmath0  line profiles , since higher - redshift surveys will naturally be limited to more luminous laes .",
    "furthermore , our measurement of the faint - end slope of the ly@xmath0  lf represents the first step towards measuring the faint - end evolution imparted by a neutral igm .",
    "an mns survey at redshift 6.5 could determine if the evolution observed at the bright - end @xcite persists at the faint - end .",
    "such observations may constrain models that describe the propagation of ionized regions in a partially neutral igm ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that spectroscopic searches for laes are able to uncover faint galaxies that can not be observed by any other means . measuring",

    "to calculate the survey incompleteness for the imacs search data , we take advantage of the fact that our emission line counts are well described by a power law between @xmath176 and @xmath177 erg s@xmath1 @xmath18 ( see figure [ comp_fig ] ) .",
    "this is easily understood , because we are summing the faint - end counts of ( primarily ) the constituent foreground populations all of which are described by power - laws .",
    "clearly , we can expect these counts to continue to rise to fainter emission line fluxes .",
    "therefore , we predict the the number of all emission line galaxies by fitting power - law to the counts brighter than @xmath177 erg s@xmath1 @xmath18 in both the cosmos and 15h fields .",
    "( the sensitivity is the same for both fields , so we include the 15h field here to improve statistics . )",
    "this fit , illustrated in figure [ comp_fig ] goes as @xmath178 .",
    "the completeness of our survey defined as the ratio of the observed counts to those predicted by our model is plotted in figure [ comp_fig ] .",
    "a completeness fraction slightly greater than unity naturally arises when the power - law fit falls slightly below the data .    for comparison",
    ", we show the model adopted by paper ii , which was estimated from a modification to the completeness function presented in paper i. the good agreement between the estimate in paper ii  and the completeness calculated here indicates that no substantial revisions to the implications in paper ii  are needed . additionally , we note that the faintest bin that we consider in this paper contains many galaxies ( 42 ) , so the poisson noise on this calculation makes a negligible contribution to our error budget . finally ,",
    "while one might expect that the completeness to line emission is different for lae candidates ( without detected continuum ) and foreground galaxies ( with detected continuum ) , the faintest bins are dominated by lae candidates , so it is reasonable to apply this incompleteness correction to the laes in our survey .",
    "in paper ii , we characterized the foreground h@xmath0 , [ ] , and [ ]  populations that comprise our sample of emission lines .",
    "subtracting the foreground lfs estimated from the cosmos field showed a significant excess of counts that suggested a steep rising slope ( @xmath125 ) for the remaining galaxies that are likely laes .",
    "additionally , an angular correlation of the ly@xmath0  candidates and [ ]  emitters showed that fewer than 30% of the lae candidates should be [ ] .",
    "since even fewer should be h@xmath0  and [ ] , the implication is that approximately 100 laes may exist in the combined cosmos and 15h survey fields . in this section",
    ", we show that the foreground number counts in cosmos are indeed higher than what we adopted in paper ii , consistent with our preference for a slightly shallower faint - end slope for the ly@xmath0  lf .",
    "in  [ ratesec ] we identified foreground galaxies through two means : objects which are obvious foreground emitters in the search data , and objects which were initially lae candidates in the search data , but are now spectroscopically or photometrically identified as foreground galaxies .",
    "the counts of the total foreground populations are listed in table [ counts1 ] , and shown again , for reference in table [ foregrounds ] where we compare these counts to the numbers predicted by the foreground luminosity functions used by paper ii . in each bin , the foreground galaxy counts that we have identified _ so far _ are similar to ( often exceeding ) the number predicted by foreground lfs .",
    "in addition , in  [ ratesec ] we showed that the results of our spectroscopic followup indicate that the unidentified lae candidates ( for which counts are also listed in tables [ counts1 ] and [ foregrounds ] ) are predominantly foreground galaxies .",
    "consequently , we expect that when our spectroscopic followup is complete , the observed foregrounds will be higher than the model favored in paper ii .",
    "we estimate these counts in the same way that we calculated the inferred lae counts in  [ ratesec ] .",
    "the inferred foreground number counts are given for two cases , with the low ( high ) counts referring to the case of six ( three ) genuine laes in this paper .",
    "including the foreground galaxies inferred among the unidentified line emitters makes the case clear : the nominal `` best estimate '' foreground counts in paper ii  were underestimated , at least for the cosmos field .",
    "however , they remain within range of reasonable foreground lfs which we considered .",
    "an alternative model is shown in table [ foregrounds ] where the faint - end slopes are all steeper by @xmath179 from their adopted values ( see paper ii ) .",
    "these counts agree more closely with our expectation from followup spectroscopy . however , a model where all three foreground populations have steeper slopes by 1@xmath124 is contrived .",
    "it is more probable that the number counts of one of the foreground populations has been significantly underestimated .",

    "when foreground emission line galaxies are detected through narrowband imaging , broad - band colors are typically used to identify the approximate redshift and probable line @xcite .",
    "not only does this mean that the [ ]  catalog will contain some h@xmath30  emitters ; an h@xmath0  catalog may be contaminated by [ ] 6716 , 6730   emitting galaxies . in practice ,",

    "2007 find 16 [ ]  emitters for only two h@xmath30  emitters ) .",
    "even if this contamination were significant , the overall [ ]  + h@xmath30  luminosity function should be sufficient to allow for an accounting of the total foreground populations _ at the bright end _",
    ", as we did in paper ii .",
    "our spectroscopic followup observations , which included known foreground objects as slit - mask filler , provide strong evidence that h@xmath30  emitters in cosmos play a more predominant role than we assumed in paper ii . in total",
    ", we have identified 15 [ ]   and 21 h@xmath30  emitters .",
    "the distributions of their fluxes are shown in figure [ hbfig ] , where , relative to the numbers of [ ]  emitters , an excess of h@xmath30  emitters fainter than about @xmath184 erg s@xmath1 @xmath18  is observed .    one way to interpret the excess of faint h@xmath30  ( relative to [ ] ) emitters is as an indication that the faint - end of the h@xmath30  lf is significantly steeper than the [ ]  lf .",
    "this would be the case if fainter [ ]  emitters have progressively lower [ ] /h@xmath30  ratios . since [ ] /h@xmath30  is strongly correlated with the r23 ( \\{[]+ [ ] } /h@xmath30 ; @xcite ) metallicity diagnostic , low [ ] /h@xmath30  ratios could be an indication of low oxygen abundance ( when galaxies are on the lower - branch of r23 ) . in practice , however , even the lowest metallicity galaxies observed at @xmath185 have high [ ] /h@xmath30  ratios ( larger than three ; @xcite ) .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath30  ratios that we measure in our deimos observations are similarly high .",
    "this means that it is difficult to interpret the excess h@xmath30  counts as an indication of low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "a more probable explanation for the h@xmath30  emitters is that we have observed an overdensity at @xmath127 . in figure",
    "[ hbfig ] , we use the zcosmos ( bright ) catalog of spectroscopic redshifts @xcite to show the spatial distributions of galaxies in the redshift windows that corresponds to h@xmath30  and [ ] @xmath294959 , 5007 .",
    "even though the volume at the `` [ ]  redshift '' is 50% larger than at the `` h@xmath30  redshift '' , the full zcosmos catalog contains 2.5 times as many galaxies in the latter redshift window . within the footprint of our imacs field ( see figure [ hbfig ] , right ) , this excess density is amplified , with a factor of four more galaxies in the redshift window at @xmath127 than at @xmath186 .",
    "the excess of faint h@xmath30  emitters in figure [ hbfig ] ( left ) is easily explained by this overdensity , which is most apparent at luminosities fainter than the knee of the h@xmath30  lf .",
    "therefore , the cosmos foreground counts at faint fluxes are indeed higher than the model adopted in paper ii .",
    "this increase over our previous estimates of the foreground populations in cosmos does not erase our signal from laes .",
    "although we find a slightly shallower slope ( @xmath187 as opposed to @xmath188 ) , these results are consistent , as @xmath189 falls within the 68% confidence interval that we present in this paper",
    ". further followup spectroscopy ( including our 15h field ) will constrain the faint - end of the ly@xmath0  lf more tightly and simultaneously measure the faint foreground populations ."
