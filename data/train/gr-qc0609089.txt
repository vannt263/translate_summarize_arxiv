    "more precisely , we examine the possibility that the scattering of a long cosmic string by a rotating black hole can cause a deformation of the long string , which may lead to the formation of a loop of cosmic string .",
    "as a segment of a long cosmic string enters the ergosphere of a rotating black hole , with rotation axis not parallel to the axis of the cosmic string , this segment may be deformed and , in some cases , it may get twisted . if the long string self - intersects , as a result of the deformation , a loop of cosmic string may be formed .",
