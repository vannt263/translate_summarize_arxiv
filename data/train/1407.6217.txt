    "since the fundamental paper of stanley @xcite , it is well - known that standard young tableaux interact with the weak order , providing and important tool to enumerate the reduced expressions of any permutation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another important family of tableaux called _ balanced tableaux _ has been defined in @xcite by edelman and greene to study this enumerative problem .",
    "the surprising feature of balanced tableaux is that they are equinumerous with standard tableaux of the same shape @xmath0 .",
    "this was showed in the original paper @xcite with a quite involved proof .",
    "the notion of balanced tableaux was further generalized in @xcite , with the introduction of the set of balanced tableaux of shape @xmath1 , where @xmath1 denotes the _ rothe diagram _ of the permutation @xmath2 . by using this new family , the authors gave in @xcite a new interpretation of the set of reduced expressions of any permutation , and derived from this a new and more accessible proof of the fact that balanced and standard tableaux are equinumerous .    in this article , we give a wide generalization of the previous result using the results from @xcite .",
    "namely , we give a new interpretation of the set of reduced expressions of a permutation from which we define many families of tableaux having similar combinatorial properties as those of balanced tableaux . as a corollary of our method , we provide an alternative proof that balanced and standard tableaux are equinumerous .    in order to do so",
    ", we deal with a bigger class of tableaux which are not required to be standard or balanced . to each tableau @xmath3 of shape @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is any finite subset of @xmath5",
    ", we associate a combinatorial object @xmath6 called the _ type _ of @xmath3 .",
    "this allows us to split the set of tableaux of shape @xmath4 into different classes : two tableaux being in the same class if and only if they have same type .",
    "let us denote by @xmath7 the set of all the tableaux having type @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , both sets of standard and balanced tableaux are special instances of this classification .",
    "we also provide an algorithmic process allowing us to construct all tableaux having a given type , and in particular this allows us to easily obtain all balanced tableaux of a given shape .    in section  [ subsectypperm ] , we associate each permutation @xmath8 with a type @xmath9 such that we have a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the set of reduced expressions of @xmath2 .",
    "this gives a new combinatorial interpretation of reduced expressions of any permutation ( not fundamentally different from the one given in @xcite , but maybe more natural with respect to the results in @xcite ) .",
    "then , we focus on the case of vexillary permutations , namely permutation being @xmath12-avoiding , which are one of the main objects studied in @xcite .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that each vexillary permutation @xmath2 is associated with a partition @xmath13 such that @xmath14 equals the number of standard tableau of shape @xmath13 .",

    "in this section , we recall some basic definitions and background about standard and balanced tableaux .    a partition @xmath0 of a nonnegative integer @xmath22 is a nonincreasing sequence of nonnegative integers @xmath23 such that @xmath24 . the integers @xmath25 are called parts of the partition @xmath0 .",
    "the ferrers diagram of @xmath0 is a finite collection of boxes , or cells , arranged in left - justified rows of lengths given by the parts of @xmath0 . by flipping this diagram over its main diagonal ,",

    "this concludes the proof .",
    "in general , finding an explicit formula for the number of tableaux of a given type @xmath6 seems to be a quite complicated problem ( note that an approach similar to that of @xcite has not been tried yet ) .",
    "however , a probabilistic approach might be possible , as suggested by the following result .",
    "let @xmath4 be a diagram , if we choose uniformly a type @xmath6 in @xmath88 , then the expected value for @xmath153 is @xmath154    set @xmath155 , it is clear that the number of types of shape @xmath4 is precisely @xmath156 .",
    "then , because of the uniform choice , the probability for a type @xmath6 to be chosen is exactly @xmath157 .",
    "thus , the expected value for @xmath139 is @xmath158 and the numerator clearly equals @xmath159 .",

    "in this section , our objective is twofold : we give a positive answer to question  [ questenum ]  ( 2 ) , and we provide a wide generalization of theorem  [ theoegbal ] .",
