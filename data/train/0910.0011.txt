    "radio continuum emission from galaxies arises due to a combination of thermal and non - thermal processes primarily associated with the birth and death of young massive stars , respectively .",
    "the thermal ( free - free ) radiation of a star - forming galaxy is emitted from hii regions and is directly proportional to the photoionization rate of young massive stars . since emission at ghz frequencies is optically thin , the thermal radio continuum emission from galaxies is a very good diagnostic of a galaxy s massive star formation rate .",
    "massive ( @xmath18 ) stars which dominate the lyman continuum luminosity also end their lives as supernovae ( sne ) whose remnants ( snrs ) are responsible for the acceleration of cosmic - ray ( cr ) electrons into a galaxy s general magnetic field resulting in diffuse synchrotron emission .",
    "thus , in a more complicated manner , the non - thermal radio continuum emission also traces the most recent star formation activity in a galaxy .",
    "ideally , one would like to isolate the thermal component as it is a more direct measure of the most recent massive star formation activity .",
    "however , at ghz frequencies , the non - thermal fraction typically dominates the total radio continuum emission ( i.e. @xmath310:1 at @xmath31  ghz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) making the isolation of the thermal fraction difficult .",
    "these same massive stars are often the primary sources of dust heating in the interstellar medium ( ism ) as their starlight is absorbed and reradiated at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths by interstellar grains .",
    "this common origin between the fir dust emission and thermal @xmath19 non - thermal radio continuum emission from galaxies is thought to be the dominant physical processes driving the fir - radio correlation on global ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and local ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) scales .",
    "while massive star formation provides a shared origin between emission at these two wavelengths , a number of physical processes must conspire to yield such a remarkably constant ratio among galaxies spanning nearly 5 orders of magnitude in luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , among other properties ( e.g. hubble type , fir color , and fir / optical ratio ) . for example",
    ", since the non - thermal synchrotron emissivity of a single electron is roughly proportional to the electron density times the square of the magnetic field strength , it would seem that the fir - radio correlation should be highly dependent on the propagation of cr electrons and a galaxy s magnetic field distribution and strength .",
    "if magnetic fields in galaxies are built - up over time , and therefore were weaker in the past , the correlation should be different at higher redshifts .",
    "however , all indications suggest that the fir - radio correlation holds out to moderate redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting that the magnetic field strength and structure in these galaxies is similar to what is observed for galaxies in the local universe .",
    "consequently , comparing the fir and radio emission characteristics of galaxies can illuminate properties that are typically inaccessible by other observational means .    at present , detailed studies of the fir - radio correlation among star - forming galaxies",
    "has been limited to only moderate redshifts at @xmath20 . with the sensitivity of existing fir and radio capabilities , studies at higher redshifts only probe the most extreme objects .",
    "for example , deep ( @xmath21mjy ) 70@xmath22 observations @xcite from the the far - infrared deep extragalactic legacy ( fidel ; pi . m. dickinson ) survey is able to probe luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath23 ) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath24 ) out to redshifts of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . with _ herschel _ , surveys such as goods-_herschel _ should improve this situation by measuring the fir properties of normal star - forming galaxies out to @xmath25 , and that of lirgs and ulirgs out to redshifts of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "alma will also play a significant role by measuring the peak of the fir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for all lirgs at @xmath29 .",
    "these populations of dusty star - forming galaxies appear to dominate the stellar mass assembly at increasing redshifts ; the star formation rate density increases by a factor of @xmath30 between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , becoming increasingly obscured ( i.e. @xmath33% ) by dust @xcite .",
    "thus , lirgs and ulirgs appear to dominate the luminosity density at increasing redshifts , and optically thin measures of star formation and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity are critical for proper quantification of stellar mass build - up over cosmic time . at radio wavelengths , however , detecting such high redshift galaxies remains extremely difficult .",
    "even with a fully operational evla , ir - bright star - forming galaxies ( e.g. m  82 ; @xmath34 ) and moderate lirgs ( i.e. @xmath35 ) will not be detectable beyond redshifts of @xmath25 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "a next - generation radio facility such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) should easily remedy this disparity between the depth of fir and radio continuum surveys . while the ska was initially proposed solely on the basis of hi science",
    ", deep continuum imaging is critical for the realization of nearly all of the five established key science projects ( ksps ) , especially studies of  the origin and evolution of cosmic magnetism \" and  galaxy evolution and cosmology . \" essential to these two science goals is the proper measurement of the star formation and agn history over cosmic time for which deep radio continuum studies may provide an excellent advantage over other wavelengths .    in this paper",
    "i present physically motivated expectations for the behavior of the fir - radio correlation at increasing redshift and discuss their implications .",
    "i also discuss how the ska , when combined with future fir observations to be obtained with next generation facilities both prior to , and commensurate with , final ska science operations , will be able to tackle interesting problems associated with these ksps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in @xmath372 i discuss the fir - radio correlation and introduce the physical processes for which it depends on .",
    "then , in section @xmath373 , i present the results for the expected evolution in the fir - radio correlation at increasingly high redshifts and report on the technical specifications for detecting high-@xmath17 galaxies in deep radio continuum surveys . in section @xmath374",
    "i discuss the physical implications of the results for characterizing the properties of galaxies at high  @xmath17 and compare these theoretical expectations with existing observations .",
    "finally , in @xmath375 , i summarize my conclusions .",
    "a major result of the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ; * ? ? ? * ) all - sky survey was the discovery of a correlation between the globally measured far infrared ( fir ;  @xmath38 ) dust emission and the optically thin radio continuum emission of normal late - type star - forming galaxies without agn @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable feature of this correlation is that it displays such little scatter ( i.e. @xmath90.26  dex ) among galaxies spanning 5 orders of magnitude in luminosity @xcite .",
    "while the fir emission is due to the thermal re - radiation of interstellar starlight by dust grains , the radio emission is primarily non - thermal synchrotron emission from cr electrons that propagate in a galaxy s magnetic field after initially being accelerated by sn shocks or other processes .",
    "the physics that maintains a strong correlation between these two quantities over such a wide range of galaxies remains unclear , however departures from the nominal ratio can shed insight on a number of typically inaccessible galaxy properties .    while the fir emission is dependent upon the chemical make - up and size distribution of dust grains , which is hard to decipher , a galaxy s non - thermal radio emission is relatively simple to interpret .",
    "what is not simple , however , is determining which energy - loss processes may dominate a galaxy s population of cr electrons , as well as the role of escape .",
    "cr electrons will cool via a number of mechanisms as they propagate through the ism of galaxies .",
    "these energy - loss processes include synchrotron radiation and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering , as well as ionization , bremsstrahlung , and adiabatic expansion losses .",
    "below i briefly describe the role that each of these energy - loss processes may play for the cases of normal star - forming galaxies and compact starbursts following @xcite .      for a typical star - forming galaxy ,",
    "cr electrons primarily lose their energy due to synchrotron and ic processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "then , assuming a magnetic field strength of 10  @xmath4 g and a cr scale - height of @xmath33  kpc ( synchrotron scale - height of 1.5  kpc ) , the typical escape time of a cr electron emitting at 1.4  ghz is @xmath3@xmath70  yr .",

    "in fact , it can be argued that deep radio continuum studies at these frequencies will provide the most accurate estimates for the star formation rate of high-@xmath17 galaxies .",
    "so long as average galaxy magnetic fields do not exceed mg strengths , which seems unlikely given that at such high redshifts it is unclear how such strong fields could be seeded , the observed radio emission at @xmath1610  ghz should be dominated by thermal ( free - free ) radiation directly associated with lyman continuum photons emitted by newly formed massive stars .    in figure [ fig-7 ] the expected observed - frame 10  ghz continuum flux densities of galaxies are plotted for a range of ir luminosities under the same assumptions that went into creating figure [ fig-3 ] ( see table [ tbl-2 ] ) .",

    "it is shown that even at 10  ghz the same population of lirgs , if they exist , should be detectable at all redshifts .",
    "furthermore , it appears that the internal magnetic strength of a galaxy does not play as signifiant a role in a source s detectability since the thermal fraction at these frequencies is so large , and becomes increasingly so with redshift .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig-8 ] where the expected thermal fraction for observed 1.4 and 10  ghz flux densities is plotted as a function of redshift for galaxies having 10 , 50 and 100  @xmath4 g fields .",
    "observations at 10  ghz are dominated by thermal emission for @xmath206 g beyond a redshift of @xmath32 .",
    "the same can not be said for 1.4  ghz observations until the galaxy population being observed lies at a redshift of @xmath1815 . at 10  ghz ,",
    "the radio emission from @xmath29 galaxies is likely to be @xmath1680% thermal emission .",
    "therefore , it is believed that deep continuum surveys at @xmath1610  ghz may provide an excellent measure for the star formation activity in the highest redshift galaxies",
    ".    this conclusion will only be valid if there is a negligible amount of microwave emission associated with dust . while thermal emission from interstellar dust grains is negligible between @xmath153  ghz ,",
    "so called anomalous dust emission , possibly arising from a population of ultrasmall , rapidly rotating grains with a non - zero electric dipole moment , may contribute significantly at microwave wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if significant , high - frequency radio observations would likely overestimate true star - formation rates .",
    "this occurrence would also require that the observed high-@xmath17 galaxies have a significant amount of ultrasmall dust grains .",
    "comparing these observations with results from alma , which should be able to detect the peak fir continuum emission from galaxies at similar high redshifts ( i.e. @xmath1815 ; * ? ? ?",

    "such tools will be critical for aiding in the interpretation of deep ska imaging surveys which , unlike alma , will be able to survey large areas of the sky relatively quickly . and",
    ", as previously stated , even if the dust content in typical galaxies at these early epochs is negligible such that their fir continuum emission is invisible to alma , radio continuum emission will likely be the best means to identify such objects and and quantify their star formation properties .      in the above presentation",
    "i have only considered variations to the observed ir / radio ratios which arise from an increase in the competition of energy - loss processes to primary cr electrons relative to synchrotron radiation .",
    "alternatively , other physical processes may have their hand in driving systematic variations in a galaxy s ir / radio ratio , perhaps even keeping the correlation linear versus redshift fortuitously .",
    "it is possible that the suppression of a galaxy s non - thermal emission may not be as significant as previously suggested if the size of galaxies decrease with increasing redshift , resulting in larger values of @xmath207 per unit star formation .",
    "for instance , @xcite suggest that the half - light radius of galaxies between @xmath208 follow an @xmath209 relationship .",
    "if true , the @xmath116 quenching of galaxy synchrotron emission is effectively reduced by a factor of @xmath210 for a constant magnetic field strength , and ic losses off the cmb will not be as significant for cr electrons . in this case",
    "such a strong departure from the canonical fir - radio correlation may not be as easily seen .",
    "however , if galaxies do become more compact , the escape times for cr electrons to leave the galaxy will likely decrease resulting in a decrease to the observed synchrotron emission . and ,",
    "if the ism of such galaxies are typically clumpy , similar to local dwarf irregular galaxies , then escape times should decrease even more ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for a random walk diffusion ,",
    "the escape time is roughly proportional to @xmath211 . assuming that @xmath212 , the escape time will decrease as @xmath213 which should compensate for the increase to @xmath207 by that same factor .",
    "furthermore , if these compact galaxies also host starbursts , advection out of each system due to a galactic wind may lead to even shorter escape times resulting in even larger ir / radio ratios at these early epochs .",
    "therefore , even if galaxies are smaller at high-@xmath17 , evolution in the fir - radio correlation with redshift is still expected to be observed such that ir / radio should be larger with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "given that local starbursting galaxies follow the fir - radio correlation , the suggestion for increased losses due to advection by galactic winds in such high-@xmath17 systems would imply that they are different than starbursts observed locally .",
    "the fir - radio correlation may also fail at high redshifts for a variety of reasons arising from differences in a galaxy s dust emission properties .",
    "for instance , ir / radio ratios should depart from the nominal value if dust is not present , the size distribution of grains take on a different form , or if the fir emitting properties of dust grains are significantly different than in the local universe .",
    "currently , observations of quasars and luminous galaxies at high-@xmath17 show that these systems contain large masses of dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while it is unlikely that these dusty systems are the representative population at early epochs , it is worth noting that the dust contained in these very young systems does not appear to be exotic enough to move systems off of the fir - radio correlation .",
    "for example , the @xmath214 quasar ( j1148 + 5251 ) , which is plotted in figure [ fig-6 ] using data taken from @xcite , has an estimated dust mass ranging between @xmath215 @xcite and @xmath216 @xcite .",
    "dust - to - gas mass ratios are also found to be @xmath160.004 which is similar to , or exceeding the , @xmath30.005 value of the galaxy .    using this qso as an example , @xcite states that sne are likely responsible for producing both the metals which compose grains , as well as supernovae - condensed dust to provide surface areas for grain growth .",
    "however , @xcite also shows that the dust in these objects are not predominantly composed of sn dust , known to have different emitting properties than that of typical dust grains in normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "rather , the bulk of the dust formed in these high-@xmath17 galaxies is attributed to grain growth occurring more rapidly than grain destruction in the ism , resulting in large dust masses that are already in place in galaxies 400  myr after the first episode of star formation .",
    "this estimate assumes that star formation within galaxies began at @xmath217 .",
    "given that the dust - to - gas ratios in these high-@xmath17 galaxies do not appear significantly different than the milky way value , and that the grain formation process ( i.e. _ in  situ _ ) is similar to that of normal star - forming galaxies in the local universe @xcite , it seems reasonable to believe that the fir dust emission from these galaxies does not drive large variations in their ir / radio ratios relative to the expected variations in their radio continuum emission .",
    "the efficiency in which crs are accelerated in snrs plays a significant role in determining the synchrotron emissivity from galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the distributed re - acceleration of cr electrons arising from external interactions such as ram pressure may add significant flux to the observed radio continuum from galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the efficiency with which the initial energy of the sne explosion is converted into kinetic energy depends on the relative importance of radiation and adiabatic losses . in systems having extremely dense ism",
    ", the adiabatic phase of the supernovae expansion may be halted as it expands into the ambient medium , thus reducing the amount of energy lost to adiabatic expansion .",
    "it is possible that this extra energy could be , at least partially , used in the acceleration of crs yielding a larger amount of synchrotron emission per unit star formation than in normal galaxies . for the smgs , whose ir / radio ratios are systematically below the fir - radio correlation by @xmath218 ( see @xmath37[sec - data ] ) , this scenario does not appear to help explain their low ratios .",
    "as an example , the modeling of @xcite shows that the total acceleration efficiency for crs increases from @xmath30.15@xmath219 to @xmath30.25@xmath219 , where @xmath220  erg is the total explosion energy of the sne , when the external ism density is increased from @xmath31  @xmath72 to @xmath310  @xmath72 .",
    "the ism densities of starbursts are likely much larger , as with the case of the example where @xmath221  @xmath72 was assumed , thus the evolution of snrs will likely be different and may work to increase the synchrotron emissivity in such galaxies through an increased efficiency in particle acceleration .",
    "however , unless smgs host starbursts that are sufficiently different than those in local starbursting galaxies , which do not appear to exhibit such variations in their ir / radio ratios , this scenario alone might not be sufficient to explain their low ir / radio ratios . at present , more simulation work on this problem is needed .",
    "so far synchrotron radiation arising for primary cr electrons accelerated in snrs has been considered .",
    "cr nuclei , which are accelerated in the same snrs , will inelastically scatter off of the interstellar gas yielding @xmath222 particles that decay into secondary @xmath223 s and @xmath224-rays , and @xmath225 particles which will decay into secondary @xmath223 s and neutrinos .",
    "these secondary @xmath223 s will undergo the same energy - loss processes described in @xmath372.1 and @xmath372.2 . at @xmath3gev energies",
    "the ratio of secondary / primary electrons in the galaxy is roughly 2:1 , and decreases to nearly 1:3 at @xmath33  gev energies @xcite .",
    "the large secondary fraction arises from the fact that there are many more cr nuclei than electrons .",
    "consequently , diffusion models suggest that @xmath320 - 50% of the diffuse ghz synchrotron emission in the galaxy arises from secondaries .",
    "however , secondary particles are produced more diffusively than primary electrons , thus their synchrotron morphology should not show any coincidence with their sites of origin .",
    "given that the fir and radio images of galaxies are remarkably similar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) argues that the secondaries likely contribute mostly near or around star - forming regions . in the case of a starburst , having a much larger ism density , the cross - section for collisions between cr nuclei and the interstellar gas is increased , thus increasing the number of @xmath223 s for a fixed primary nuclei / electron ratio which may actually dominate the diffuse synchrotron emission .",
    "determining the contribution of additional synchrotron emission arising by an increased population of secondary @xmath223 s clearly goes beyond the scope of this paper , however the fact that this effect may play a role is noteworthy .",
    "the recently launched @xmath226 @xmath224-ray observatory may help to shed some light on this topic .      while star - forming galaxies are currently thought to be responsible for completely reionizing the intergalactic medium ( igm ) by @xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ionizing flux arising from star formation in lyman break galaxies at similar redshifts @xcite appears to fall a factor of @xmath227 below the minimum value required to maintain an ionized igm for a given clumping factor and escape fraction under the assumption of a salpeter stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "@xcite has shown that this discrepancy can be reconciled by flattening the stellar imf to have a slope of @xmath228 if reionization occurred at @xmath229 .",
    "the idea of a top heavy imf at these epochs does not seem completely inappropriate given that low metallicity environments will favor the production of more high - mass stars . in this case , one expects there to be both more sne , increasing the amount of non - thermal synchrotron emission , as well as an increase to the ionizing photon rate per baryon , leading to an increase in the thermal radio continuum emission .",
    "it is worth noting that only a few sne are required to enrich a galaxy from primordial values to a few tenths solar metallicity , thus most galaxies observed with ages larger than a dynamical timescale are not likely to be that metal poor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the results of @xcite , the ionizing photon rate for a stellar imf having a slope of @xmath230 is a factor of @xmath91.7 times larger than a that for a typical salpeter imf slope of @xmath231 over a mass range of @xmath232 .",
    "similarly , for a given star formation rate , such a change to the slope of the stellar imf should result in an increase to the core collapse supernova rate by a factor of @xmath92 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . thus ,",
    "if the stellar imf in these high redshift systems transitions to being top heavy , the results presented here should not be significantly affected as both the thermal and non - thermal radio continuum output should change by factors of @xmath592 . in the case that there is a significant amount of dust in these high-@xmath17 systems , and assuming that their non - thermal radio continuum emission is completely suppressed by the additional ic losses to cr electrons by the cmb , their ir / radio ratios should still remain similar for a varying imf given that both the fir and thermal radio emission are directly proportional to the ionizing photon rate .",
    "however , since the increase to the ionizing photon rate will translate into an increase to the thermal radio emission , careful analyses of radio source counts at these redshifts , along with comparison between rest - frame uv studies , may help to illuminate possible variations to the stellar imf .",
    "in this article i have put together a predictive analysis for the expected evolution of the fir - radio correlation versus redshift arising from variations in the cr electron cooling time - scales as ic scattering off of the cmb becomes increasingly important . as a result , i have looked at how discrepancies between observed and predicted ir / radio ratios can be used to characterize the magnetic field properties of galaxies at high-@xmath17 , where the application of other observational indicators are extremely difficult . in doing so ,",
    "i have also looked at the value of deep radio continuum surveys in studies of star formation at high-@xmath17 , particularly in the context of the ska .",
    "my findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "deep radio continuum observations at frequencies @xmath1610  ghz using next generation facilities like the ska will likely provide the most accurate measurements for the star formation rates of normal galaxies at high  @xmath17 . the non - thermal emission from such galaxies should be completely suppressed due to the increased ic scattering off of the cmb leaving only the thermal ( free - free ) emission detectable ; this situation may be complicated if ` anomalous ' microwave emission from spinning dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in such systems is not negligible . 2 .",
    "for normal star - forming galaxies to remain on the local fir - radio correlation at high redshifts requires extraordinarily large magnetic field strengths to counter ic losses from the cmb .",
    "for example , the magnetic field of a @xmath5 galaxy must be @xmath16500  @xmath4 g to obtain a nominal ir / radio ratio .",
    "thus , galaxies which continue to lie on the fir - radio correlation at high-@xmath17 , such as the sample of radio - quiet qso s , most likely have radio output which is dominated by an agn , or the physics at work is simply unknown .",
    "the average ir / radio ratio among a sample of @xmath7 smgs is consistent with that for a sample of @xmath6 smgs .",
    "this is in strike contrast with the factor of @xmath33 increase expected due to the increase in energy losses to cr electrons from ic scattering off of the cmb between these two redshifts .",
    "while this comparison suffers from low number statistics , it suggests that either the star formation driven ir and/or radio continuum emitting properties of these two populations of smgs are different , or that agn dominate the radio output of both of them . simply assuming that their magnetic field strengths are significantly large ( i.e. @xmath193 g ) is problematic since",
    ", in the presence of such strong fields , cr electrons emitting at ghz frequencies will cool primarily by ionization and bremsstrahlung processes rather than by synchrotron radiation which should lead to large ir / radio ratios unless other physics is at work .",
    "4 .   to detect typical lirgs ( @xmath15 ) at all redshifts will require njy sensitivities at ghz frequencies , specifically a 5@xmath8 point - source sensitivity of @xmath920  njy ( i.e. @xmath143  njy ) .",
    "thus , for the ska to achieve this sensitivity for a reasonably long ( 300  hr ) integration necessitates that @xmath233  m@xmath12  k@xmath13 . at this sensitivity , the ska will be sensitive to all galaxies forming stars at @xmath325  @xmath136 .",
    "this includes a significant amount of sources included in the uv luminosity function work of @xcite between @xmath234 .",
    "5 .   deviations in the ir / radio ratios of normal star - forming galaxies at high redshifts will likely provide one of the only ways to put constraints on the existence and strength of magnetic fields in the early universe .",
    "for instance , if one knows the radio spectral index , galaxies with magnetic fields @xmath5950  @xmath4 g should be easily identifiable once beyond a redshift of @xmath164 as their ir / radio ratios should be a factor of @xmath164 larger than the nominal value , on average .",
