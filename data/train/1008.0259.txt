    "the kloe experiment operates at , the frascati .  is an  collider running at a center of mass energy of 1020 , the mass of the  meson .",
    "positron and electron beams collide at an angle of @xmath0 - 25 mrad , producing  mesons with small boost in the orbit plane ( @xmath1 mev ) .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber ( dc ) surrounded by a lead - scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) . a superconducting coil around the emc provides a 0.52 t axial field .",
    "the dc@xcite is 4 m in diameter and 3.3 m long and has 12,582 all - stereo tungsten sense wires .",
    "the chamber shell is made of carbon fiber - epoxy composite and the gas used is a 90% helium , 10% isobutane mixture .",
    "these features maximize transparency to photons and reduce @xmath2  regeneration and multiple scattering .",
    "the position resolutions are @xmath3150  and @xmath42 .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath5 .",
    "the calorimeter@xcite is divided into a barrel and two endcaps , and covers 98% of the solid angle .",
    "the modules are read - out at both ends by photomultipliers , both in amplitude and time for a total of 2440 cells per side arranged in five layers .",
    "cells close in time and space are grouped into calorimeter clusters .",
    "the cluster energy @xmath6 is the sum of the cell energies .",
    "the cluster time @xmath7 and position @xmath8 are energy - weighed averages .",
    "energy and time resolutions are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "actually kloe has already acquired 2.5  of data and a new extensive campaign of data taking is starting aiming at an integrated luminosity of 25 .    the cross section for the process @xmath2  production is 3.3  and the  meson decays into  with a branching fraction of 34% .",
    "the initial state of the kaon pair is produced via strong interaction with quantum numbers @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the two kaons are in an antisymmetric correlated state and the time evolution of their state in two different final states @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the two kaons as a function of the difference of decay time ( @xmath17 ) can be expressed as the decay intensity as a function of : @xmath18 where @xmath19",
    "a general theoretical possibility for  violation is based on spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry , as developed by kosteleck@xcite : the standard - model extension ( sme ) .    in sme for neutral kaons ,  manifests",
    "to lowest order only in the  violation parameter @xmath20 , and exhibits a dependence on the 4-momentum of the kaon : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the kaon boost factor and velocity in the observer frame , and @xmath24 are the   violation coefficients for the two valence quarks in the kaon .    the time dependence arising from the rotation of the earth can be explicitly displayed in by choosing a three - dimensional basis ( @xmath25 ) in a nonrotating frame , with the @xmath26 axis along the earth s rotation axis , and a basis @xmath27 for the laboratory frame@xcite .",
    "the  violating parameter @xmath20 may then be expressed as : @xmath28 , \\label{ads : eq : delta_sid}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the sidereal time , @xmath30 is the earth s sidereal frequency and @xmath31 is the angle between the earth rotation axis and the @xmath32 direction in the laboratory frame .    since inside the kloe detector , kaons are produced in almost all direction , it is possible to use the experiment like a telescope to explore any direction in the space by using two different method to measure the @xmath33 parameters of :    * by studying the sidereal time variation of the semileptonic asymmetry of the  and . a preliminary measurement of the @xmath34 has been already performed with kloe data using the difference between the semileptonic asymmetries of  and : @xmath35@xcite . * by studying the quantum interferometry between the two kaons , . in this case",
    ", two different final state can be considered : ( @xmath36 ,  @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ,  @xmath38 ) .    in",
    "the following we will focus on interferometry with the channel @xmath2@xmath2 .",
    "detailed discussion concerning other methods can be found elsewhere@xcite . using this channel the two kaons decay both in the same final state , but have opposite momenta and experience different direction in the space .",
    "for instance , we can distinguish between the two kaons by their forward or backward emission .",
    "in this way it is possible to define as @xmath39 @xmath40 the one going in the forward ( backward ) direction with @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "the ratio of amplitudes in is @xmath43 .",
    "since the kaon momenta are opposite , a small asymmetry in the decay intensity @xmath44 will appear and the following ratio will be different from zero : @xmath45 the above asymmetry for @xmath46 tends to zero , because @xmath47 and @xmath20 are @xmath48 out of phase@xcite : @xmath49 while for @xmath50 @xmath51 and therefore to @xmath52 .    with analysis based on 1",
    "we get a preliminary result on @xmath52@xcite : @xmath53    this analysis scheme using the simple forward backward asymmetry is not sensitive to @xmath34 and its effect is washed out in the asymmetry and . as shown in this parameter is coupled only with the @xmath22 factor . since at  the  is produced with a small boost in the horizontal plane the kaons have different values for @xmath22 as a function of the azimuthal angle . the ratio of the decay intensities @xmath44 distribution for events in which the @xmath39 propagates opposite or along the  momentum will enhance the small asymmetry introduced by the @xmath34 component of the @xmath20 parameter . for values of @xmath34 of the order -18",
    ", we expect an effect on the @xmath44 up to 1%-2% in the region @xmath54 from which we expect to be able to put limits of the order -17,--18 ,",
    ".    the @xmath33 parameters can be all simultaneously measured by performing a proper sidereal time dependent analysis of asymmetries of @xmath44 , and .",
    "an accuracy @xmath55 could be reached with the analysis of the full kloe data sample .",
    "all four @xmath24 parameters of the sme can be independently measured at kloe , completing results obtained by fixed beam experiments .",
    "the continuation of the kloe physics program with kloe-2@xcite at an improved da@xmath56ne machine is currently starting . the data taking campaign will be organized in two different steps . during the first one we will double the statistics already taken by kloe with a new beam interaction scheme@xcite and with the inclusion of two pairs of electron - positron taggers@xcite for the study of the gamma - gamma physics .",
    "the second phase aims to an integrated luminosity of 25 including several upgrades for the kloe detector :    * a pair of crystal calorimeters ( ccalt@xcite ) near the interaction region to improve the angular acceptance for low-@xmath57 particles ; * a pair of tile calorimeters ( qcalt@xcite ) covering the quadrupoles along the beam pipe made of tungsten foil and singly read - out scintillator tiles to improve the angular coverage for particles coming from the active volume of the dc ; * a small and light tracker ( it@xcite ) made of four planes of cylindrical gem to improve the resolution of the vertex reconstruction around the interaction point and to increase the low-@xmath57 charged particles acceptance .",
