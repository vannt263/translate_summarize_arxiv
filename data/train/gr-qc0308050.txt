    "this work presents methods to search for periodic gravitational waves generated by known pulsars , using data collected by interferometric gravitational wave detectors . to illustrate these methods ,",
    "upper limits are placed on the strength of waves emitted by pulsar j1939 + 2134 at its expected @xmath0hz emission frequency during s1 @xcite .",
    "s1 is the first observational science run of the ligo @xcite and geo @xcite detectors and it took place during 17 days between august 23 and september 9 , 2002 .",
    "the sensitivity of the searches presented here surpasses that of previous searches for gravitational waves from this source .",
    "however , measurements of the spin - down rate of the pulsar indicate that a detectable signal is very unlikely given the instrument performance for this data set : for these early observations the detectors were not operating at their eventual design sensitivities .",
    "substantial improvements in detector noise have been achieved since the s1 observations , and further improvements are planned .",
    "we expect that the methods presented here will eventually enable the direct detection of periodic gravitational waves .    in section  [ s :",
    "detectors ] , we describe the configuration and calibration of the four ligo and geo interferometers and derive their expected sensitivities to periodic sources having known locations , frequencies and spindown rates . in section  [",
    "s : sources ] we consider proposed neutron star gravitational wave emission mechanisms , and introduce notation for describing the nearly monochromatic signals emitted by isolated neutron stars .",
    "statistical properties of the data , analyses methods and results are presented in section  [ s : datanalysis ] .",
    "these results are then summarized and compared in section  [ s : results ] . in section",
    "[ s : results ] we also interpret the upper limits on the signal amplitude as a constraint on the ellipticity of the pulsar and consider our results in the context of previous upper limits .",
    "gravitational waves are a fundamental consequence of einstein s general theory of relativity @xcite , in which they represent perturbations of the spacetime metric which propagate at the speed of light .",
    "gravitational waves produced by the acceleration of compact astrophysical objects may be detected by monitoring the motions they induce on freely - falling test bodies .",
    "the strength of these waves , called the _ strain , _ can be characterized by the fractional variation in the geodesic separation between these test bodies .    during the past decade ,",
    "several scientific collaborations have constructed a new type of detector for gravitational waves .",
    "these large - scale interferometric detectors include the us laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) , located in hanford , wa , and livingston , la , built by a caltech - mit collaboration @xcite ; the geo600 detector near hannover , germany , built by a british - german collaboration @xcite ; the virgo detector in pisa , italy , built by an italian - french collaboration @xcite ; and the japanese tama300 detector in tokyo @xcite . in these detectors ,",
    "the relative positions of suspended test masses are sensed interferometrically .",
    "a gravitational wave produces a time - varying differential displacement @xmath1 in an interferometer that is proportional to its arm length @xmath2 .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational wave is described by the dimensionless strain @xmath3 . for realistic periodic astrophysical sources we typically expect strain amplitudes smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "the following sections introduce the operating configurations of geo600 and ligo detectors during the s1 run .",
    "the references provide more detailed descriptions of these detectors .",
    "the geo600 detector comprises a 4-beam michelson delay line system of arm length 600 m .",
    "the interferometer is illuminated by frequency - stabilized light from an injection - locked nd : yag laser . before reaching the interferometer",
    ", the light is passed through two 8 m triangular mode - cleaning cavities . during s1",
    "approximately 2w of light was incident on the interferometer .",
    "a power recycling mirror of 1% transmission was installed to increase the effective laser power available for the measurement .",
    "ligo comprises three power - recycled michelson interferometers with resonant fabry - perot cavity arms .",
    "a 4 km and a 2 km interferometer are collocated at the hanford site and are designated h1 and h2 respectively , and a 4 km interferometer at the livingston site is designated l1 .",
    "each interferometer employs a nd : yag laser stabilized using a monolithic reference cavity and a 12 m mode - cleaning cavity .    in all four instruments",
    "the beam splitters , recycling mirrors and test masses are hung as pendulums from multilayer seismic isolation filters to isolate them from local forces .",
    "the masses and beam paths are housed in high vacuum enclosures to preclude optical scintillation and acoustic interference .",
    "sinusoidal calibration forces of known amplitude were applied to the test bodies throughout the observing run .",
    "these signals were recovered from the data stream and used to periodically update the scale factors linking recorded signal amplitude to strain .",
    "the principal calibration uncertainties arise from the imprecision in the electromechanical coupling coefficients of the force actuators .",
    "these were estimated by comparison with the known laser wavelength , by actuating a test mass between interference fringes . in the hanford interferometers ,",
    "the calibration was also verified against piezoelectric displacement transducers connected to the mirror support structures . for the s1 observations ,",
    "the net amplitude uncertainty was estimated at @xmath54% for geo , @xmath510% for each of the ligo interferometers .",
    "we define the gravitational wave strength @xmath6 of a continuous signal from a given source as the maximum peak amplitude which could be received by an interferometer if the orientation of the pulsar and the detector were both optimal .",
    "thus , @xmath6 depends on the intrinsic emission strength and on the source distance , but not on the inclination of the pulsar s spin axis or on the antenna pattern of the detector .",
    "the calibrated interferometer strain output is a time series @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the received signal , @xmath9 is the detector noise and @xmath10 is the time in the detector s frame .",
    "the noise @xmath9 is characterized by its single - sided power spectral density @xmath11 . assuming this noise is gaussian and taking some fixed observation time is between a few days and several months . ]",
    "@xmath12 , we can compute the amplitude @xmath6 of a putative continuous signal which would be detected in , e.g. , 90% of experimental trials if truly present , but would arise randomly from the noise background in only 1% of trials ( what we call a 1%  false alarm rate \" and a 10%  false dismissal rate \" ) .",
    "if we fix a false alarm rate , it is clear that the lower the desired false dismissal rate the higher the signal needs to be .",
    "the detection statistic used in section [ ss : frequency ] provides the lowest false dismissal rate for a given false alarm rate and signal strength and it is thus optimal in the neyman - pearson sense ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude of the average signal that we could detect in gaussian stationary noise with a false alarm rate of 1% and a false dismissal rate of 10% using the detection statistic described in @xcite is given by [ uls ] h_0 = 11.4 , where @xmath13 is the frequency of the signal used here is twice that defined in @xcite , 2 ) we use a different statistic for this detection problem ( a chi - square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom ) and 3 ) we have specified a false dismissal rate of 10% whereas the derivation in @xcite has an implicit false dismissal rate of about 50% .",
    "if we use this false dismissal rate and the @xmath14 statistic we get @xmath15 . ] . the upper curves in fig .  [",
    "f : uls ] show @xmath16 for the ligo and geo detectors during s1 . observation times for respective interferometers are given in the figure .",
    "because of ground motion , equipment failures and alignment drifts , the four interferometers were not always fully operational during the s1 run , thus the observation times vary from detector to detector .",
    "the lower curves in fig .",
    "[ f : uls ] represent @xmath17 corresponding to the design sensitivity of the various detectors .",
    "an observation of @xmath18 1y was assumed .    the filled circles in fig .  [",
    "f : uls ] show the constraints that measurements of spin - down rates of known pulsars place on the expected gravitational wave signal , under the assumption that the pulsars are rigid rotators with a moment of inertia of @xmath19 and _ that all the observed spin - down rate is due to the emission of gravitational waves_.    as shown in fig .  [",
    "f : uls ] , under the above assumptions no detection is expected for any known pulsar at the sensitivity achieved during the s1 run .",
    "furthermore , many known pulsars are rotating too slowly to be detected by the initial ground - based interferometers .",
    "however , the number of millisecond pulsars observed in this band continues to increase with new radio surveys , and the known targets plotted here constitute a highly selected sample .",
    "future searches for previously undiscovered rotating neutron stars using the methods presented here will sample a different and potentially much larger subset of the total population .     of a known monochromatic signal detectable with a @xmath20 false alarm rate and a @xmath21 false dismissal rate by the geo and ligo detectors at the s1 sensitivity and with an observation time equal to the up - time of the detectors during s1 ( geo:401h , l1:137h , h1:209h , h2:214h ) .",

    "these upper limits were derived under the assumption that all the measured loss of angular momentum of the star is due to the emission of gravitational waves , _ neglecting spin - down contribution from electromagnetic and particle emission_. the arrow points to the filled circle representing pulsar j1939 + 2134.,width=302 ]",
    "the strongest argument that some neutron stars ( nss ) _ are _ emitting gravitational waves ( gws ) with amplitude detectable by advanced ligo  @xcite , @xmath24 , is due to bildsten  @xcite .",
    "he noted that the inferred rotation frequencies of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are all clustered in the range @xmath25hz ( an inference strengthed by the recent observations of  @xcite ) , whereas _ a priori _ there should be no cut - off in @xmath26 , up to the ( estimated ) ns break - up frequency of @xmath27khz . updating a suggestion by wagoner  @xcite",
    ", bildsten proposed that lmxbs have reached an equilibrium where spin - up due to accretion is balanced by spin - down from gw emission .",
    "since the gw spin - down torque scales like @xmath28 , a wide range of accretion rates then leads to a rather narrow range of equilibrium rotation rates , as observed .",
    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are generally believed to be recycled pulsars : old pulsars that were spun up by accretion during an lmxb phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rotation rates of msps also show a high - frequency cut - off  @xcite ; the fastest ( psr j1939 + 2134 ) has @xmath29hz . if the gws that arrest the spin - up of accreting nss continue to be emitted in the msp phase ( e.g. , because of some persistent deformation of the ns shape away from axisymmetry ) , then they could also account for the observed spin - down of msps . in this case , the gw amplitudes of msps would in fact be ( very close to ) the ` spin - down upper limits ' shown in fig .",
    "[ f : uls ] .",
    "( note that the msp s spin - down rate is generally attributed entirely to the pulsar s magnetic field ; indeed , pulsar magnetic fields are typically inferred this way",
    ". however , there appears to be no strong evidence supporting this inference . )",
    "we now turn to the possible physical mechanisms responsible for periodic gws in this frequency range .",
    "the main possibilities that have been considered are 1 ) ns spin precession , 2 ) an excited ns oscillation mode ( mostly likely the r - mode ) , and 3 ) small distortions of the ns shape away from axisymmetry . at present the third mechanism ( small ellipticity )",
    "seems the most plausible source of detectable gws , and in this paper we set upper limits for this particular mechanism ( the three mechanisms predict three different gw frequencies for the same observed rotation frequency ) .",
    "however , we begin by briefly commenting on the other two possibilities .    a ns precesses ( or ` wobbles ' ) when its angular momentum @xmath30 is not aligned with any principal axis of its inertia tensor .",
    "a wobbling ns emits gws at the inertial - frame precession frequency , which is very nearly the rotation frequency , @xmath26 .",
    "while large - amplitude wobble could plausibly produce gw amplitudes @xmath31 over short timescales , the problem with this mechanism is that dissipation should damp ns wobble quickly  @xcite ; while this dissipation timescale is quite uncertain ( it is perhaps of order a year for a msp ) , it is almost certainly orders of magnitude shorter than typical lifetimes of msps . so unless some mechanism is found that regularly re - excites large - amplitude wobble , it is unlikely that any nearby msp would be wobbling .",
    "moreover , most msps have highly stable pulse shapes , and typically appear _ not _ to be wobbling substantially .",
    "in particular , the single - pulse characteristics of psr j1939 + 2134 have been observed to be extremely stable with no pulse - to - pulse variation except for occasional giant pulses  @xcite .",
    "it has been verified through radio observations that psr j1939 + 2134 continued to spin according to a simple spin - down model during s1 @xcite .",
    "r - modes ( modes driven by coriolis forces ) have been a source of excitement among gw theorists since 1998 , when andersson  @xcite and friedman and morsink  @xcite showed that they should be unstable due to gravitational back - reaction ( the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz instability ) .",
    "nonlinear mode - mode coupling is predicted to saturate the growth of r - modes at dimensionless amplitude @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this implies r - mode radiation from nascent nss in extragalactic supernovae will not be detectable , but r - mode gws from old , recycled galactic nss could still be detectable by advanced ligo .",
    "for example , gws from an excited r - mode could balance accretion torque in accreting nss , as in the wagoner - bildsten mechanism .",
    "we now turn to gws from small non - axisymmetries in the ns shape .",
    "if @xmath6 is the amplitude of the signal at the detector from an optimally oriented source , as described above , and if we assume that the emission mechanism is due to deviations of the pulsar s shape from perfect axial symmetry , then @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the distance to the ns , @xmath35 is its principal moment of inertia about the rotation axis , @xmath36 is its ellipticity , and the gravitational wave signal frequency , @xmath13 , is exactly twice the rotation frequency , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath37 is newton s constant , and @xmath38 is the speed of light .",
    "this is the emission mechanism that we assume produces the gravitational wave signal that we are targeting .",
    "one possible source of ellipticity is tiny ` hills ' in the ns crust , which are supported by crustal shear stresses . in this case , the maximum ellipticity is set by the crustal breaking strain @xmath39  @xcite : @xmath40 the coefficient in eq .",
    "[ eps_max ] is low both because a ns s crust is rather thin ( compared to the ns radius ) , and because the crust s shear modulus @xmath41 is small compared to the ambient pressure @xmath42 : @xmath43 .",
    "( if nss have solid cores , as well as crusts , then much larger ellipticities would be possible . ) for the lmxbs , ushomirsky , cutler & bildsten  @xcite showed that lateral temperature variations in the crust of order @xmath44 , or lateral composition variations of order @xmath45 ( in the charge - to - mass ratio ) , could build up ns ellipticities of order @xmath46 , but only if the crust s breaking strain is large enough to sustain such hills .",
    "strong internal magnetic fields are another possible source of ns ellipticity .",
    "cutler  @xcite has argued that if a ns s interior magnetic field @xmath47 has a toroidal topology ( as expected if the @xmath47 field was generated by strong differential rotation immediately after collapse ) , then dissipation tends to re - orient the symmetry axis of the toroidal @xmath47 field perpendicular to the rotation axis , which is the ideal orientation for maximizing equatorial ellipticity .",
    "toroidal @xmath47 fields of order @xmath48 g would lead to sufficient gw emission to halt the spin - up of lmxbs and account for the observed spin - down of msps .      a gravitational wave signal we detect from an isolated pulsar will be amplitude - modulated by the varying sensitivity of the detector as it rotates with the earth ( the detector s ` antenna pattern ' ) . the detected strain has the form @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the angle between neutron star s spin direction @xmath51 and the propagation direction of the waves @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the phase evolution of the signal . @xmath54",

    "more sensitive untargeted ul results on the strain of periodic gw signals at other frequencies come from acoustic bar detector experiments @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . due to the narrow sensitivity bands of these detectors ( less than 1hz around each mode ) , and",

    "this search was based on the same detection statistic used in our frequency domain analysis .",
    "another parameter space search is presented in @xcite .",
    "data taken from the allegro detector during the first three months of 1994 were searched for periodic gravitational wave signals from the galactic center and from the globular cluster 47tuc , with no resolvable spin - down and with @xmath13 in the two sensitive bands of their antenna , @xmath77hz and @xmath78hz , with a 10@xmath41hz resolution .",
    "the resulting ul at @xmath79 is reported .",
    "there exist several results from searches using early broadband interferometric detectors @xcite . due to the poor sensitivities of these early detector prototypes , none of these upper limits is competitive with the strain sensitivity achieved here .",
    "however , many of the new issues and complications associated with broadband search instruments were first confronted in these early papers , laying the foundations for future analyses .",

    "the reported 99% confidence upper limit was @xmath82 @xcite .    improved noise performance and longer observation times achieved with interferometric detectors since",
    "s1 has made their sensitivities comparable to or better than the narrow band peak sensitivity of the acoustic bars cited above , over much broader bandwidths .",
    "combined with the advances in analysis methods presented in this paper we anticipate significant advances in search depth and breadth in the next set of observations .",
    "an ul on @xmath6 for j1939 + 2134 can be interpreted as an ul on the neutron star s equatorial ellipticity . taking the distance to j1939 + 2134 to be @xmath83kpc , eq .",
    "[ h0_eps ] gives an ul on ellipticity corresponding to @xmath84 of @xmath85    of course , the ul on the ellipticity of j1939 + 2134 derived from s1 data is about five orders of magnitude higher than the ul obtained from the pulsar s measured spindown rate : @xmath86 however , an ellipticity of @xmath68 could in principle be generated by an interior magnetic field of strength @xmath87 g , or it could probably be sustained in a ns with a solid core . therefore ,",
    "the above exercise suggests that with improved detector sensitivities , even a null result from a search for _ unknown _ pulsars will place interesting constraints on the ellipticities of rapidly - rotating neutron stars that might exist in our galactic neighborhood .",
