    "is excluded because the gravitational law would change at macroscopic level , but the cases @xmath12 are allowed by gravity experiments .",
    "there are also astrophysical and cosmological bounds @xcite because there are a tower of graviton kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes which contribute to the supernova cooling @xcite , the total mass of the universe and the late - time photon production @xcite _ etc .",
    "_ we may avoid some of these problems by assuming an extremely low reheating temperature of the early universe .",
    "to have an inflation model with such a low temperature is already a tough subject , especially with the cosmological moduli problem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we need baryon asymmetry after the inflation while the temperature is quite low and we knew that the process which generates baryon asymmetry should not induce proton decay .",
    "it is better to have higher reheating temperature for many reasons , but it is very hard to avoid known restrictions .",
    "there is another problem in tev scale gravity .",
    "the simplest model of this type would not provide intermediate scales which are necessary to explain phenomenological issues like , the apparent gauge coupling unification @xcite , small neutrino masses and the strong cp problem .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that particles dwelling in the extra dimensions , other than graviton , can have similar effective interaction terms in four - dimensional physics .",
    "this type of interaction is suppressed as gravity and thus give extremely weak interaction between bulk matter and normal matters . for the neutrino ,",
    "there have been many discussions and researches about how to extend the minimal setting to obtain the small neutrino masses and mixing @xcite , but the axion as a solution of the strong cp solution has not been studied thoroughly in this context . in this paper",
    "we will propose an axion model in tev scale gravity for various numbers of the extra dimensions , with special emphasis on cosmological constraints : the addition of the axion in the large - extra - dimension model substantially alters the cosmology .    in the following sections , we will use the convention @xmath13 reduced planck mass and @xmath14 fundamental scale",
    "if an axion is a boundary field confined on 4 dimensions , the peccei - quinn ( pq ) scale @xmath15 is bounded by @xmath16 tev . to obtain a higher pq scale ,",
    "the axion field has to be inevitably a bulk field .",
    "if it lives in the whole ( 4+n ) dimensional bulk , the pq scale will be @xmath17 .    however , the damped coherent oscillation of the axion vacuum at the early universe with @xmath17 would overclose the universe . a conventional argument",

    "since the axion dwells in the extra - dimensional brane , their masses are proportional to @xmath63 and they have stronger couplings than the graviton kk modes to the normal matters in general cases .    if there is no hidden particle which couples to the axion or the mass of the kk mode axion is lower than the sum of three pion masses @xmath64 mev , the main decay channel of light kk axion is to two photons .",

    "however massless particles in the higher dimensional brane _ are not _ massless in our four - dimensional universe since they have momenta in the extra dimensions which appear masses in our universe @xcite .",
    "another way to avoid this difficulty is assuming a large number of four - dimensional lattices in the bulk .",
    "but we need at least @xmath74 _ empty _ universes .",
    "or we should assume the existence of a four - dimensional hidden sector which has @xmath74 times more degrees of freedom than those of the standard model while they should not be produced significantly by the reheating process after the inflation .",

    "details on these cases are discussed in appendix b.      at the temperature of the universe around @xmath70 mev , it is required that there should not be additional particles which contribute to the energy density significantly .",
    "otherwise @xmath98he would be produced more than what is observed now because the universe should expand faster than the standard scenario .",
    "we apply a rather loose bound that the energy density contribution by the kk mode should be smaller than one neutrino energy density at @xmath99 mev . at high @xmath100 mev@xmath101 , axion kk mode production dominated by process iii . in case iii",
    ", one may practically have maximal mass @xmath102 for the kk mode which is produced in the thermal bath .",
    "thus the bound from bbn is @xmath103 where @xmath104 is normalization constant which is equal to @xmath105 in torus compactification with universal distance @xmath8 . in our calculations we restrict ourselves to this case .    if @xmath106 , approximately @xmath107 for @xmath53 , this reads @xmath108 tev , and for @xmath55 , @xmath109 tev .",

    "( [ eq : m1 ] ) .",
    "energetic photons from heavy axion kk modes which decay after @xmath47 sec can destroy the light elements made during the nucleosynthesis .",
    "therefore there are several bounds on the density of the kk modes which weigh than @xmath45 mev .",

    "usually these bounds are less important than cosmological microwave background bound given below .      if the massive kk modes decay after @xmath121 sec but before the recombination era , the produced photons may give a distortion of the cosmological microwave background radiation .",
    "the cobe observation gives a bound @xcite @xmath122 where @xmath123 is temperature at kk mode decay .",

    "rather it will be natural to imagine that there is a parallel universe(s ) or another four - dimensional wall in the brane . or",
    "one can just imagine that there are some unknown particles on our wall itself .",
    "then one can consider the situation that thermally produced kk modes of graviton will mainly decay into the axion in the brane and axions both from the graviton decay and the thermal production will decay into the parallel wall if this wall has some kind of qcd and/or @xmath130 type of interactions .",
    "( or it can decays into some hidden qcd/@xmath130 fields in our universe . ) since the axion decay width is highly suppressed by @xmath131 with @xmath132 being the fine structure constant , it is easy to get a low branching ratio to decay into the photon , in other words , most of the axions decay into the other wall(invisible section ) if the coupling constant , the color factor of the other gauge interaction , and/or the number of the fermions with pq charges in the decay loop diagram in the other wall(invisible section ) are large enough .      here",

    "this mechanism can solve the problem of the overclosure of the universe by the kk modes .",
    "note that the fat - brane particles are not necessarily the axions as we discussed , but can be any other weakly interacting particles living in a higher dimensional brane .",
