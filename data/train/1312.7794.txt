    "the reconstruction of a function from given measurements is a fundamental task in data processing and occupies numerous directions of research in mathematics and engineering .",
    "a typical problem requires the reconstruction or approximation of a physical field from pointwise measurements .",
    "a field may be a distribution of temperatures or water pollution or a solution to a diffusion equation , in mathematical terminology a field is simply a smooth function of several variables .",
    "the standard assumption on the smoothness is that the field is bandlimited to a compact spectrum .",
    "if the spectrum is a fundamental domain of a lattice in @xmath0 or a symmetric convex polygon in @xmath1 , then there exist precise reconstruction formulas from sufficiently many samples in analogy to the shannon - whittaker - kotelnikov sampling theorem  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be the fourier transform   in the exponent .",
    "] of @xmath3 or @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the imaginary unit and @xmath6 denotes the scalar product between vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath9 .",
    "we say that @xmath10 is bandlimited to the closed set @xmath11 , if its fourier transform @xmath12 is supported on @xmath13 . in this case we write @xmath14 for the space of fields with finite energy bandlimited to the spectrum @xmath13 . in the context of field estimation",
    "we always assume that the spectrum is a compact , symmetric , convex set .",
    "the classical theory of sampling and reconstructing of such high - dimensional bandlimited fields dates back to petersen and middleton @xcite in signal analysis and to beurling  @xcite in harmonic analysis .",
    "both identified conditions for reconstructing such fields from their point measurements in @xmath15 .",
    "further research on non - uniform sampling generated more results on conditions for perfect reconstruction from samples taken at non - uniformly distributed spatial locations .",
    "see  @xcite and the survey @xcite .",
    "previous work deals primarily with the problem of reconstructing the field from measurements taken by a collection of static sensors distributed in space , like that shown in figure [ fig : sampr2a ] . in this case",
    "the performance metric for quantifying the efficiency of a sampling scheme is the spatial density of samples .",
    "this is the average number of sensors per unit volume required for the stable sampling of the monitored region .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a different method for the acquisition of the samples , which we call _ mobile sampling_. the samples are taken by a mobile sensor that moves along a continuous path , as is shown in figure [ fig : sampr2b ] . in such a case",
    "it is often relatively inexpensive to increase the spatial sampling rate along the sensor s path while the main cost of the sampling scheme comes from the total distance that needs to be traveled by the moving sensor .",
    "hence it is reasonable to assume that the sensor can record the field values at an arbitrarily high but finite resolution on its path .",
    "the new method for the acquisition of samples changes the mathematical nature of the problem completely . when using samples from static sensors , we need to establish a sampling inequality with evaluations of the form @xmath16 for constants @xmath17 independent of @xmath10 .    for mobile sampling ,",
    "we need to establish a `` continuous '' sampling inequality of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the sum of line integrals along the paths .",
    "again , the performance metric should reflect the cost required for the data acquisition .",
    "for the appropriate metric is the average number of sensors , i.e. , samples , per unit volume .",
    "for some of us have argued in  @xcite and in @xcite that the relevant metric should be the average path length traveled by the sensors per unit volume ( or area , if @xmath20 ) .",
    "we call this metric the _ path density_. such a metric is directly relevant in applications like environmental monitoring using moving sensors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in retrospect this metric is also useful in designing @xmath21-space trajectories for magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) @xcite , where the path density can be used as a proxy for the total scanning time per unit area in @xmath21-space .",
    "the continuous sampling inequality   raises many interesting questions both for engineers and for mathematicians . on the mathematical side",
    "are the abstract construction of continuous frames in the sense of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chaps .  3 and 5 ) or  @xcite or the analysis of sampling measures and their properties , see  @xcite for a theory of sampling measures for fock spaces and for bergmann spaces .",
    "on the engineering side , we need to design concrete , realizable trajectories with a small path density for bandlimited fields with convex spectrum .",
    "this problem was introduced by some of us in @xcite and @xcite and answered for the special case of trajectory sets that consist of a union of uniformly spaced lines .",
    "the contribution in this article is twofold .",
    "first , we study arbitrary trajectory sets of parallel lines and derive a necessary condition for the minimal path density in the style of landau s famous result in  @xcite . extending the results in @xcite we show , in theorem [ th : parallel ] , that the minimal path density achievable by sampling along trajectories of arbitrary parallel lines is exactly the area of the maximal hyperplane section of the spectrum .",
    "we work under the standard assumption that the spectrum of the signals is convex and symmetric ( although some results holds for more general spectra , see section [ sec : conc ] ) .    at first glance",
    ", the sampling along parallel lines seems to be an easy generalization of point sampling , because it can be reduced to the sampling problem in smaller dimensions .",
    "however , even this case offers some interesting and challenging problems that we did not envision before .",
    "for instance , in section  3 we will use the existence of universal samplings sets as established by olevsky and ulanovsky  @xcite and by matei and meyer  @xcite in order to prove that the frame bounds are uniform for sections of convex sets .",
    "in addition , this result enriches our knowledge about the properties of universal sampling sets . for another crucial argument",
    "we need the brunn - minkowski inequality  @xcite .",
    "of course , the mathematician s immediate instinct is to study more general sets of trajectories and try to prove a result analogous to landau s necessary condition for the path density .",
    "we show in proposition  [ prop : infzero ] that such a result can not hold by constructing stable trajectory sets with arbitrarily small path density .",
    "thus in a sense there is no optimal configuration of paths and the problem of optimizing the path density is ill - posed .",
    "this answers a question raised in @xcite .",
    "however , as soon as we minimize over trajectory sets with given stability parameters @xmath22 ( uniform frame bounds ) the optimization problem becomes well - posed .",
    "our main density result ( theorem  [ th : infab ] ) shows that the path density for a stable set of trajectories is bounded below by an expression involving the stability parameters and the geometry of the spectrum .",
    "this is a report on a successful and fertile collaboration between engineers and mathematicians .",
    "we , the mathematicians , are intrigued by the questions that motivate mobile sensing . although the mathematical literature has investigated generalizations of sampling ( the theorems of sereda - logvinenko and the theory of sampling measures ) for the sake of generalization , we would never have dreamt of the particular conditions on the paths that are imposed by practical considerations ( see condition  ) .",
    "we , the engineers , are intrigued by the mathematical subtleties that popped up at every corner and subsequently led to an extended theory of path sampling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : probstat ]",
    "we describe the formal problem statement .",
    "then , in section [ sec : optresults ] , we characterize the minimal density of sampling trajectories consisting of parallel lines .",
    "section [ sec : disc ] treats the problem of optimizing over arbitrary trajectories , and section [ sec : conc ] presents some conclusions .",
    "the proofs of some technical lemmas needed throughout the article are postponed to section [ sec_tec ] , so as not to obstruct the flow of the article .",

    "<S> we study the design of sampling trajectories for stable sampling and the reconstruction of bandlimited spatial fields using mobile sensors . the spectrum is assumed to be a symmetric convex set . as a performance metric </S>",
    "<S> we use the path density of the set of sampling trajectories that is defined as the total distance traveled by the moving sensors per unit spatial volume of the spatial region being monitored . </S>",
    "<S> focussing first on parallel lines , we identify the set of parallel lines with minimal path density that contains a set of stable sampling for fields bandlimited to a known set . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the problem becomes ill - posed when the optimization is performed over all trajectories by demonstrating a feasible trajectory set with arbitrarily low path density . </S>",
    "<S> however , the problem becomes well - posed if we explicitly specify the stability margins . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this by obtaining a non - trivial lower bound on the path density of an arbitrary set of trajectories that contain a sampling set with explicitly specified stability bounds . </S>"
