    "the study of the mechanical properties of individual biopolymers serves as an important laboratory to probe polymer physics at the length scale of a single chain and further elucidates the biological processes in which these molecules take part@xcite .",
    "for example the biologically fundamental processes of dna replication , transcription , the regulation of transcription rely on the dna protein interactions involving the mechanical deformation and microstructural modification of dna both at long length scales as well as at the scale of individual base pairs .",
    "recent advances in the experimental manipulation of individual biological macromolecules has opened a new window on these processes and allows for the direct quantitative test our understanding of the mechanical properties of these macromolecules in thermal equilibrium .",
    "these single - molecule manipulation experiments have probed the mechanical properties of not only dna@xcite but also a variety of biologically important macromolecules including polysaccharrides@xcite , and giant proteins such as titin @xcite and tenascin @xcite .",
    "the better theoretical understanding of protein mechanics will enhance the interpretation of protein force spectroscopy , which may even shed light on protein folding pathways @xcite although this latter point appears to be somewhat controversial@xcite .",
    "regardless , understanding the mechanical properties of proteins is fundamental to elucidating the allosteric or conformation changes that many proteins undergo as part of their biological activity@xcite .",
    "these last examples demonstrate the feasibility of the direct mechanical manipulation of single proteins .",
    "however , modelling the mechanical properties of these atypically large proteins or , for that matter , any entire protein is a daunting task since such molecules have complex structures that result from a number of local and nonlocal interactions along the polymer chain . in order to make quantitative progress in the interpretation of these protein manipulation",
    "experiments it appears to be useful to first understand in more detail the mechanical properties of simpler polypeptide - based structures .",
    "a natural candidate for such a simpler structure is a protein subdomain of one secondary structure . here",
    "too there is experimental input : single molecule force spectroscopy via afm has been used to directly probe alpha - helical polypeptides@xcite as well as synthetic polymer chains with a local helical structure such as peg @xcite .    in order to understand the mechanical properties of proteins in general and alpha - helical polypeptides in particular it is necessary to develop a new minimalistic model that incorporates both the conformational fluctuations of the polymer backbone and localized structural transitions of the constituent monomers . in other words",
    "it is necessary to augment simple models of the statistical mechanics of the peptide backbone with new terms to account for the presence of secondary structure along the chain .",
    "furthermore , we must allow for interaction between the degree of local secondary structure and the conformational degrees of freedom of the polypetide backbone .    in this paper",
    "we examine the predicted mechanical properties of such a minimalistic model of an alpha - helical polypeptide in which we allow the interaction of the local secondary structure of the chain with its conformational degrees of freedom .",
    "we treat the local presence or absence of secondary structure as a two - state ( ising - like ) variable along the chain backbone , which is itself described by a set of local tangent vectors to the chain . in order to make this simplification ,",
    "we coarse - grain the polymer so that each independent monomer can be unambiguously assigned a state of secondary structure .",
    "this requires us to consider a model comprised of coarse - grained chain segments ( _ i.e. _ monomers ) each consisting of about three amino acids .",
    "the interaction between the internal , secondary structure variables and the conformation of the polymer chain as described by the set of backbone tangent vectors is effected by the presence of a bending modulus of the backbone whose value depends on the local state of secondary structure . when these three amino acids making up one model monomer adopt a local configuration consistent with alpha - helical secondary structure",
    ", the hydrogen bonding between these amino acids@xcite renders that segment of the chain significantly stiffer than the same polymer without the locally ordered secondary structure .",
    "thus the bending energy associated with the local change in the backbone tangent vectors is higher in regions having alpha - helical structure than in regions locally adopting a random coil configuration .",
    "similar models can and have been applied to study the mechanical properties of dna and have been discussed in the current context as well@xcite .    to qualitatively characterize our results presented below , we note that , due to the presence of the internal state variables representing secondary structure along the chain and their control over the local chain bending modulus , the alpha - helix is predicted to have a highly nonlinear response to both bending torques and to extensional forces . under small externally applied torques ,",
    "the molecule will deform so that its thermally averaged chain contour takes the form of the arc of a circle and the torque necessary for bending the molecule through a given angle grows linearly with that angle .",
    "the molecule deforms roughly as a flexible rod . at a critical torque ,",
    "however , the secondary structure of the molecule is locally disrupted producing a small length of the backbone with a much softer bending modulus .",
    "the total curvature that had been uniformly distributed along the backbone becomes localized in the anomalously soft region produced by the disruption of the secondary structure and the torque required to enforce the curvature of the molecule drops precipitously .",
    "the long range goals of this sort of modelling go beyond the interpretation of the emerging experiments on the mechanical properties of polypeptides having alpha - helical secondary structure . by understanding the mechanical properties of the constituent elements of a protein it should be possible to develop a lower dimensional representation of protein mechanics . in place of the atomic coordinates of the backbone carbons and the positions of the various amino acid residues",
    ", one may describe protein domains ( having definite secondary structure ) as a space curve having some nonlinear extensional and bending compliances that may be computed in terms of a few energy scales determined either from experiment or simulation . using three - dimensional protein structural data and such a nonlinear elastic model for each structural element of definite secondary structure",
    ", one can attempt to build mechanical models of entire proteins that , due to their highly reduced number of degrees of freedom are more tractable for numerical investigation than those based on all atom simulations .    from the study of those models",
    "one may be able to extract low energy conformational pathways and thus make predictions regarding protein allostery .",
    "for example , from a combination of native - state protein structural data and the calculated nonlinear elastic properties of alpha - helical protein domains it may thus be possible to predict the mechanical properties of the alpha - helical coiled coil region in myosin ii @xcite or alpha - helix rich proteins such as spectrin as probed by mechanical unfolding experiments @xcite . further data on protein conformational change is available from numerical simulation@xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we introduce the alpha - helix hamiltonian based on a combination of the worm - like chain and the helix / coil model . using this model",
    "we calculate the response of the chain to bending torques in section [ bending ] .",
    "we then take up the problem of the extensional compliance of the alpha - helix in section [ stretching ] before summarizing the results and discussing possible experimental tests of the theory in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the worm - like chain ( wlc)@xcite is the fundamental coarse - grained model for a polymer at length scales shorter than its thermal persistence length . this model describes the single - chain polymer statistics in terms of a quadratic hamiltonian that associates an energy cost with chain curvature by introducing a bending modulus @xmath0 . in terms of a discretized chain model described by the set of monomeric tangent vectors @xmath1 , @xmath2 with @xmath3 the degree of polymerization , the wlc hamiltonian may be written as @xmath4.\\ ] ] the effect of this bending energy is to enhance the statistical weight of straight chain configurations on a length scale of @xmath0 monomers equal to the thermal persistence length . here and throughout this paper",

    "it may be easily checked that this length is equal to the arc length ( measured in monomer lengths @xmath6 ) of the polymer chain over which the chain tangent vectors thermally decorrelate . at length scales much longer than @xmath7 the effect of this bending energy is minimal and the equilibrium statistics of the polymer become controlled by a combination of intrachain collisions and chain configurational entropy @xcite with a renormalized kuhn length . in",
    "theta solvent one finds in the limit of very long worm - like chains the radius of gyration to be given by @xmath8 where @xmath6 is the monomeric length .",
    "the single - chain response to externally applied tension @xmath9 has also been exhaustively researched within the wlc description of the polymer @xcite .",
    "the fundamental result of this work is that one may determine the extensional compliance of the molecule as a function of applied force .",
    "this compliance is defined as @xmath10 , the derivative of the equilibrium chain length @xmath11 with respect to the applied force @xmath9 . at low forces",
    "it is essentially constant reflecting the standard , quadratic reduction in chain configurational entropy associated with long , flexible polymers . at high forces",
    ", however , the compliance goes to zero as @xmath12 due to the fact that the chain has a finite length at even arbitrarily high forces .",
    "the characteristic form of the approach of the compliance to zero in the high force limit is controlled by the pulling out of small , transverse thermal fluctuations of the chain and thereby recovering the arc length stored in them to increase @xmath11 .",
    "while the wlc is a highly successful model to describe the force extension properties of a number of biopolymers such as dna , it is clear that it is not sufficient to properly describe these molecules under large enough tensions . at larger tensile stresses , details of the internal structure of the molecule",
    "become important for the understanding of conformational properties of the molecule .",
    "for example , under large enough stresses the double - helix structure of dna ( b - dna ) can be unwound allowing each monomer to lengthen by a factor of about 1.85 @xcite . to account for such ( two - state ) internal degrees of freedom along the chain ,",

    "the energy @xmath18 playing the role of an external magnetic field in the ising system now represents the free energy cost per monomer to be in the non - native ( _ i.e. _ random - coil ) state .",
    "this term is thus controlled by a combination of the chemistry of the monomeric residues and solvent quality ; its calculation from fundamental solution chemistry is beyond the scope of the current work , however we will attempt to estimate its magnitude based on experiment .",

    "one may gain insight into the mechanical properties of alpha - helical domains of proteins that are similarly constrained in the protein s native state .      to consider the bending response of the chain to applied torques in thermal equilibrium we first express the restricted partition function of the system subject to the constraint that the chain tangent deflects by a fixed angle @xmath28 over its total arc length .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the chain bends in the plane defined by first and last chain tangent that are being constrained ; to simplify the calculation we assume that we may examine the problem in this two - dimensional subspace . in that case",

    "the added enthalpic cost of the additional domain wall is more than compensated by the translational entropy associated with the placement of that random coil segment . for shorter chains or chains having higher cooperativity , homogeneous nucleation",
    "is replaced by heterogenous nucleation ; the random coil segment appears at one end of the chain .",
    "based on these considerations , the transition between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation of random coil segments should occur for chains where @xmath87 . finally , even shorter chains or chains with still higher chain cooperativity , one can encounter a regime in which the entire chain spontaneously loses its native secondary structure at a critical angle .",
    "such a transition should occur only if @xmath88 .",
    "the curves shown in figure  [ torque - curves ] correspond the intermediate case of heterogeneous nucleation of random coil segments .",

    "we have proposed and explored an extension of the traditional wlc polymer model in order to incorporate the presence of internal degrees of freedom along the polymer backbone and the coupling of those internal degrees of freedom to the conformational degrees of freedom of the chain .",
    "such a model constitutes a minimal description of many biopolymer systems , but we focus on developing a description of an alpha - helical polypeptide chain . by studying the mechanical properties in thermal equilibrium of such polymers one",
    "will develop insight into the mechanical properties of _ de novo _ designed alpha - helical chains and biomemtic synthetic polymers that acquire helical secondary structure in aqueous solution .",
    "eventually one would like to apply such a model to entire proteins although such a program requires in general a mechanical description of beta - sheets and an investigation of the mechanical interaction of protein subdomains . in principle",
    ", the combination of a model of the nonlinear elastic properties of such domains with an accurate three - dimensional protein structure in its native state should enable the investigation of protein dynamics and particularly conformation change under biologically relevant conditions .",
    "it is known that at least some proteins are bistable having at least two structurally different conformations . in this paper",
    "we have shown that , due to the coupling of the conformational degrees of freedom to the internal , secondary structure variables , alpha helices are generically bistable mechanically .",
    "one may speculate as to whether this inherent bistability provides a mesoscopic mechanism to elucidate protein conformational change .    in order to carry forward this program and to make quantitatively falsifiable predictions for the mechanical properties of single alpha helices",
    "it is necessary to determine the for energy scales that enter the hcwlc hamiltonian .",
    "unfortunately , these four energy scales are imprecisely known at best .",
    "the better studied energy scales involve the helix coil ( hc ) parameters @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "both of these parameters are extremely difficult to estimate based on first principles since these energy scales involve complex solvation energies @xcite in addition to the formation of hydrogen bonds between adjacent turns of the alpha helix .",

    "thus we note that since typical alpha - helix domains in proteins have @xmath252 @xcite these domains are highly cooperative , @xmath253",
    ".    there is little data on the persistence length of alpha helices .",
    "we estimate the bending modulus of an alpha helix by assuming that its enhanced stiffness arises primarily from inter - loop hydrogen bonding .",
    "taking the energy scale of these hydrogen bonds to be @xmath254 ",
    "@xmath255 @xcite , an inter - loop distance of @xmath256 nm and helical radius @xmath257 nm we find that ( with @xmath5 ) the persistence length of the alpha - helix should be @xmath258 - @xmath259 . from this persistence length",
    "we determine the hcwlc bending modulus via : @xmath260 so that @xmath261 . with the absence of hydrogen bonding in the nonnative , random coil state we assume that the persistence length is @xmath262 nm , typical of simple hydrocarbons @xcite .",
    "thus it is reasonable to suppose that @xmath263 .",
    "there is a significant dependence of thermal persistence length upon local secondary structure : the ratio @xmath264 may be as large as @xmath265 . in order to explore the phenomenology of the model we have shown results for various parameter values ,",
    "but we have always included plots corresponding to these biologically relevant parameters mentioned above . from these estimates of the biologically relevant energy scales in the model",
    "we predict the critical torques for the buckling failure of the alpha helix to be @xmath266 .",
    "the force required to pull out the alpha helices leading to the dramatic lengthening of the chain is roughly @xmath267pn .",
    "the central result of this paper is that an alpha - helical polypeptide is highly nonlinear in its response to applied forces and torques .",
    "the source of the nonlinearity is the coupling between local secondary structure and the conformational state of the polypeptide backbone .",
    "bending or pulling on the alpha helix mechanically can result in the abrupt breakdown of secondary structure and consequently a dramatic increase in bending and extensional compliance .",
