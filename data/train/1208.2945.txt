    ", can also be observed in experimental systems .",
    "creating an experimental embodiement of a pwl system resides in the ability to design multiple linear systems ( or a single system with variable parameters ) and a physical switch .",
    "examples of linear systems used to produce experimental pwl dynamics are lrc ( inductance , resistance , capacitance ) audio - frequency circuits.@xcite they are popular because their parameters can be easily switched with conditions based on their voltage or current .",
    "this allows the lrc circuits to operate in two different linear states.@xcite physical switches implemented in pwl systems use various components such as digital logic gates and operational amplifiers.@xcite though the switching times between the linear states are not infinitely fast , they are usually considered negligible for lrc circuits ( being orders of magnitude faster than the system s dynamics ) and thus make lrc systems good for pwl experiments.@xcite    a novel lrc - based implementation of a pwl system has been designed recently by corron _",
    "et al._.@xcite in their circuit , negative damping ( gain greater than one ) induces oscillations about a piecewise - constant voltage with a growing amplitude that is bounded by a piecewise constant driving voltage .",
    "the driving voltage switches its sign in response to a guard condition on the system s present dynamics , and leads to the generation of audio - frequency pwl chaos .",
    "such chaos is fully characterized by the temporal evolution of the piecewise - constant voltage that serves as an easily - accessible , real - time symbolic dynamics .",
    "this approach , with its simultaneous generation of analog and digital chaos , demonstrates advantages over traditional chaos generators from an application point - of - view .",
    "one of them is the existence of a matched filter for robust chaos - based communications@xcite and radars@xcite in noisy environments .    the range of applications for pwl chaos , as envisioned by corron _",
    "_ , motivates an ultra - high - speed version of their circuit",
    ". however , non - ideal behaviors of lrc circuits make it difficult to realize an ultra - high - speed pwl mode - of - operation . above a certain frequency ,",
    "the propagation times of signals through lrc circuits are no longer negligible,@xcite and the dynamics evolve on a time scale that is comparable to the switching times of the system s electronic pwl operators .",
    "furthermore , nonlinearities tends to arise in lrc systems at ultra - high - frequency ( uhf ) @xcite and thus introduce undesired effects into the pwl system .",
    "therefore , in order to overcome these obstacles , a new architecture must addresses these challenges that are at the forefront of nonlinear dynamics and electronic design .    in this paper , we present the design and operating characteristics of a novel chaotic system , shown in fig . [",
    "fig : experimental_setup_2 ] , that uses feedback loops to realize uhf low - dimensional chaos . in the following sections ,",
    "we first describe the two main components of our electronic system : ( i ) an analog time - delayed feedback - loop , which generates a multi - mode oscillations ; and ( ii ) a digital time - delayed control loop , which bounds the amplitude of the oscillations using a threshold condition and generates a digital - like waveform that follows the threshold crossings .",
    "then , we show that the dynamics produced are chaotic and pwl using a time - delayed return map . finally , we present a pwl physical model that captures the dynamics displayed by our chaos generator .",
    "the time - delayed feedback loop in see fig . [ fig : experimental_setup_2 ] is used to generate growing - amplitude oscillations , similar to the negative damping in corron _",
    "s designs.@xcite it comprises a variable gain amplifier ( vga ) that is self fedback .",
    "the vga produces a voltage @xmath9 that is delayed by time @xmath10 by means of coaxial cables and connected to its input [ ( @xmath11 ) ] .",
    "the net gain @xmath12 of the feedback loop depends on the the vga s gain , which is controlled by the voltage @xmath13 applied to its control port .",
    "if @xmath14 then @xmath15 , otherwise @xmath16 .",
    "as we will show , these two gain values yield different dynamical regimes for the entire feedback loop .",
    "the presence of a time - delayed feedback loop has important implications for the spectral properties of our system compared to that of corron _",
    "et al._. for example , it generates multi - mode oscillations instead of mono - mode oscillations.@xcite within the bandwidth @xmath17 of the vga , resonances that lead to multi - mode oscillations occur approximately at integer multiples of @xmath18 .",
    "if the pass - band of @xmath17 is larger than the ( approximate ) inter - mode spacing , the system becomes multi - mode .",
    "in addition , the multi - mode resonances and @xmath17 are dependent on the value of @xmath13 . to characterize these spectral changes",

    "[ fig : experimental_setup]c ) , we observe resonances with relatively constant amplitude , and we approximate @xmath23 with a shift in the central frequency @xmath24 ( see appendix ) .",
    "when the net - gain of the feedback is greater than unity ( without an external source ) , the vga amplifies multi - mode signals after each roundtrip in the feedback loop until it saturates .",

    "the output voltage @xmath26 starts showing modulated oscillations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_and_decay]b ) .",
    "when oscillations grows beyond @xmath27 , the vga saturates and behaves nonlinearly such that the dynamics become a stable periodic oscillation of constant amplitude at frequency @xmath28 ( see fig .",

    "we maintain the saturated behavior for approximately @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) to confirm it is not transient dynamics .",

    "this experiment shows that a single feedback - loop system can generate multi - mode uhf oscillations .",
    "away from saturation , the feedback loop operates linearly and is governed solely by the values of its net gain ( @xmath32 ) , the time delay @xmath10 , and the band - pass characteristics appropriate for a given value of @xmath13 .",
    "this experiment also shows that , without proper control over the time spent in the growth regime , the system saturates rapidly ( @xmath33s ) , which introduces nonlinearity into the dynamics .    however , if the vga gain is switched fast enough and with proper timing , it can avoid saturation and remain in its linear mode - of - operation . for this , in the upcoming section , we introduce an additional time - delayed feedback loop that bounds the amplitude of the multi - mode oscillations .",
    "this digital _ control loop _ is specifically designed to parallel aspects of the guard condition from ref .",

    "this design is adequate to realize a switching condition for pwl dynamics , except that it requires additional time - delay to guarantee proper control on the fast dynamics existing in the feedback loop .",
    "with low - speed systems , the processing time of the components in a control loop , called the control - latency - time ( clt ) , is usually orders of magnitude faster than the timescales of the dynamics to be controlled and therefore can be neglected.@xcite in our uhf system , however , this is not the case .",
    "the average period in @xmath26 is @xmath39 , which should be compared to the summed clt of the lga and ttl gate of approximately @xmath40 . as a result",
    ", it is not possible for the switching condition to affect instantaneously the feedback - loop oscillations as they are generated .",
    "however , we can control the envelope of the oscillations ( evolving on a slower time - scale ) if @xmath34 is applied to the vga at the proper time with respect to feedback - loop delay time .",
    "this is obtained by adjusting the time delays of both the control and feedback loops to be approximately equal .",
    "such an approach has been already used successfully to stabilize a very - high - frequency optoelectronic chaotic system.@xcite    the time delay @xmath10 of the feedback loop is tunable with respect to the length of coaxial cable used in the design of our circuit .",

    "we explain the observed dynamics based on the system design .",
