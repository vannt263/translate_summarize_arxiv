    ". this line cuts @xmath10 in a point @xmath11 . in the same way we define successively",
    "@xmath12 the second tangent line to @xmath5 from @xmath13 meets @xmath9 in @xmath14 .",
    "now two situations can occur : @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "this second case is clearly the general case .    if @xmath15 the polygon @xmath17 is simultaneously inscribed in @xmath3 and circumscribed around @xmath5 .",
    "our aim is to prove that in this case , there are infinitely many polygons with @xmath1 sides simultaneously inscribed in @xmath3 and circumscribed around @xmath5 ( see theorem [ produitdedroites ] ) .",
    "it means that the existence of such polygons does not depend on the initial point but only on @xmath5 and @xmath3 .    on the contrary , if @xmath16 the polygon will never close after @xmath1 steps for any initial point on @xmath3 .",
    "this kind of result is called a porism and it is of the same nature than steiner porism ( see @xcite , thm.7.3 ) for circles tangent to two given circles or poncelet porism for two conics ( see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .    to prove this porism we _ dualize _ the situation and we consider the dual polygon inscribed in @xmath5 . to be more explicit , let us assume that @xmath15 .",
    "then the situation can be dualized in the following way .",
    "any line @xmath18 in the configuration is the polar line of a point @xmath19 ( its pole ) .",
    "any tangent line @xmath20 is the polar line of a point @xmath21 for @xmath22 . for @xmath23 , the lines @xmath24 and @xmath25 meet in @xmath19 . by this way we obtain an inscribed polygon @xmath26 with @xmath1 sides passing through @xmath4 fixed points @xmath27 ( this inscribed polygon corresponds to the choice of a @xmath1-cycle among the permutations of @xmath1 points ) .     and its dual inscribed in @xmath28 lines and circumscribed around @xmath5 . , height=321 ]",
    "this inscribed polygon leads to study frgier s involutions that are particular automorphisms of @xmath5 .",
    "indeed we verify that the porism ( seetheorem [ produitdedroites ] ) is true when the product of the @xmath4 frgier s involutions giving the incribed polygon is also a frgier s involution .    so first of all we recall the definition and the main properties of these automorphisms",
    ". then we study the product of involutions .",
    "more precisely we wonder when a product of @xmath4 involutions is still an involution . + for @xmath29 , it is very well known ( see proposition [ two ] ) . + for @xmath30 , we prove that the product is an involution if and only if the centers are aligned ( see proposition [ uvw2 ] ) .",
    "it is an other way to set out the so - called pascal theorem .",
    "+ for @xmath31 , we propose a new proof of a generalization of pascal theorem due to mbius ( see theorem [ mob ] ) .",
    "we prove also that the product of @xmath32 involutions is an involution when their centers are aligned ( see proposition [ alignes ] ) .",
    "the projective duality give us the dual versions of all these results , like brianchon theorem for instance ( see theorem [ dmob ] and proposition [ dalignes ] ) .    in the last section",
    "we prove our poncelet type theorem for lines ( see theorem [ produitdedroites ] ) and we conclude by an explicit computation in the case of two lines simultaneously inscribed and circumscribed around a smooth conic .",
    "the group @xmath33 acts on @xmath34 in the usual way .",
    "an element @xmath35 which is not the identity @xmath36 on @xmath37 is called an involution if @xmath38 .    considering @xmath39 as the space of @xmath40 invertible matrices it is clear that any @xmath41 has at most two fixed points ( @xmath42 has three fixed points if and only if @xmath43 ) . moreover , when @xmath42 is an involution it is easy to verify that it has exactly two fixed points and that it is determined by the data of these fixed points .",
    "the veronese embedding @xmath44 induces an embedding for groups @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath35 be an involution on @xmath37 .",

    "a general line through @xmath48 cuts @xmath5 in two points .",
    "the map exchanging these points is an involution on @xmath5 ( i.e. on @xmath37 ) .",
    "its fixed points are the intersection points of @xmath5 with the polar line of @xmath48 .",
    "such an involution is called _ frgier involution _ on @xmath5 with center @xmath48 .    since an involution",
    "is determined by its fixed points , this involution is @xmath42 .",
    "we have verified that :    any involution on @xmath49 is a frgier s involution .",
    "rigorously speaking we should not write product but composition of involutions . anyway , from now , since for matrices it becomes a product we will write product in any case .",

    "it follows that @xmath84 are fixed points of both @xmath51 and @xmath63 , that is a contradiction since an involution is uniquely determined by its fixed points .",

    "we denote by @xmath51 the involution defined by @xmath93 , @xmath52 the one defined by @xmath92 and @xmath55 the last one defined by @xmath94 . then by following lines we verify that @xmath95 let @xmath66 be a fixed point of @xmath63",
    ". then @xmath96 are fixed points of @xmath97 .",
    "since an element of @xmath98 that has more than three fixed points is the identity , we have proved that @xmath68 is an involution .",
    "the result now follows from proposition [ uvw2 ] .",
    "[ coropascal ] the center of the product of three involutions @xmath99 and @xmath100 with aligned centers ( on a line @xmath60 ) belongs also to @xmath60 .",

    "then @xmath102 .",
    "it implies @xmath103 i.e that the product of @xmath104 and @xmath52 is an involution . according to theorem [ uvw2 ]",
    "their centers are aligned .",
    "we show that the product of an odd number of involutions with aligned centers is still an involution .",
    "we can not expect an equivalence as it was in proposition [ uvw2 ] but only an implication . indeed let us give a product of five involutions with three centers on a line @xmath60 and two centers on another line",
    "@xmath5 that is also an involution .",
    "so , let us consider a line @xmath60 and three points @xmath105 on it .",
    "we associate three involutions @xmath106 to these centers .",
    "the product @xmath107 is also an involution by proposition [ uvw2 ] .",
    "moreover , according to remark [ coropascal ] its center @xmath48 belongs to @xmath60 .",
    "now we introduce another line @xmath5 passing through @xmath48 , and two others points @xmath108 on @xmath5 .",
    "let us call @xmath109 the associated involutions .",
    "then @xmath110 and @xmath111 is an involution because their centers @xmath112 are aligned .",
    "[ alignes ] let @xmath113 be involutions on @xmath49 with respective centers @xmath114 .",
    "if @xmath114 are aligned then @xmath115 is an involution .",
    "let @xmath116 .",
    "we recall that the fixed points of @xmath52 are also fixed points of @xmath117 .",
    "the automorphism @xmath52 possesses at least one fixed point @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the line of centers and @xmath118 .",
    "these two points are exchanged by @xmath52 and then are not fixed points of @xmath52 .",
    "the points @xmath119 are fixed points of @xmath117 , then @xmath120 .",
    "the proposition is not valid for an even number of involutions .",
    "indeed since two points are always aligned it is clearly not valid for two involutions .",
    "consider now three involutions with aligned centers @xmath121 .",
    "call @xmath55 their product .",
    "let @xmath122 be another involution with its center on the previous line of centers .",
    "then the product @xmath123 is an involution if and only if the four fixed points form an harmonic division .",
    "but if we move the center of @xmath122 on @xmath60 the cross - ratio is changing .",
    "so for the general point on @xmath60 the product will not be involutive .    in general when the product of involutions is an involution we are not able to say something pertinent about the position of their centers .",
    "but , when the product of @xmath4 involutions is still an involution and at least @xmath124 centers are aligned , mbius proved that all the centers are aligned ( see @xcite , page 219 ) .",
    "we prove again this theorem in the terminology of frgier s involution .",
    "the formulation below is the one given in adler s article ( see @xcite , thm .",
    "1 ) .    [ mob ]",
    "let @xmath125 be points on a smooth conic .",
    "consider the intersection points @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 if all of these points except possibly one are collinear then the same is true for the remaining point .    as we have seen before ( in proposition [ uvw2 ] )",
    "it is true for three involutions since the product of three involutions is an involution if and only if the centers are aligned .",
    "moreover as we said in remark [ coropascal ] the center of the product is also aligned with the three others .",
    "we need only to prove the result for four involutions .",
    "indeed let us verify that we can reduce the general case ( @xmath31 ) to three or four involutions . consider @xmath129 involutions .",
    "any group of three terms among @xmath130 for @xmath131 gives a new involution with a center on the same line .",
    "so when @xmath4 is odd it remains three involutions after reductions @xmath132 . since the product is an involution the centers are aligned .",
    "but the centers of @xmath51 and @xmath133 are already on the line @xmath60 . then the center or @xmath134 is also on @xmath60 . when @xmath4 is even it remains four involutions after reduction @xmath135 with the first three centers on @xmath60 .",
    "so let us consider the case @xmath136 with @xmath52 an involution .",
    "we have @xmath137 .",
    "the center @xmath138 belongs to @xmath139 if and only if @xmath140 is an involution , i.e. if and only if @xmath141 is an involution . to prove it let us show that @xmath142 . since @xmath105 are aligned the product @xmath143 is involutive , so @xmath144 . then @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "since @xmath147 we obtain @xmath148      all the results obtained above can be _",
    "dualized _ by considering polar lines of points and poles of lines with respect to the smooth conic @xmath5 . by this way any inscribed polygon into @xmath5 induces a circumscribed polygon ( with the same number of sides ) around @xmath5 . even if mbius theorem was certainly _",
    "dualized _ by mbius himself , we write one more time this dual version below .    [ dmob ] let @xmath149 be a polygon tangent circumscribed to the smooth conic @xmath5 .",
    "if the diagonals joining @xmath150 to @xmath151 for @xmath152 are concurrent lines then the same is true for the remaining diagonal joining @xmath153 to @xmath154 .    for @xmath30 it is brianchon theorem .",
    "proposition [ alignes ] implies that one can construct an inscribed polygon in @xmath5 when @xmath4 aligned points @xmath155 ( not on @xmath5 ) are given .",
    "indeed let @xmath48 be a point on @xmath5 and let us take successively its images by the involutions @xmath156 associated to the centers @xmath19 : @xmath157 then let us take successively the images of @xmath158 by the involutions @xmath156 : @xmath159 since the product is involutive the process stops and we have : @xmath160 in other words , from a general point on @xmath5 we can draw by this method an inscribed polygon with @xmath161 sides .",
    "dualizing this statement , we verify the following proposition :    [ dalignes ] let us consider @xmath32 concurrent lines @xmath18 meeting a smooth conic @xmath5 in @xmath161 distinct points .",
    "then take any point @xmath162 on @xmath9 and draw a tangent to @xmath5 from this point .",
    "this tangent cuts @xmath10 in one point @xmath163 .",
    "let us draw successively @xmath164 for @xmath165 and @xmath166 for @xmath167 .",
    "then the line @xmath168 is tangent to @xmath169 .",
    "the following theorem is not a consequence nor of the well known poncelet closure theorem ( except when the configuration consists in two lines ) neither of darboux theorem ( the configuration is not a poncelet curve associated to @xmath5 and described in @xcite ) .",
    "we say that a polygon with @xmath1 sides joining @xmath1 vertices is well inscribed in a configuration @xmath3 of @xmath4 lines when each line of the configuration contains exactly two vertices .",

    "in particular a general point in @xmath3 is a vertex of such a polygon .",
    "the given polygon of @xmath1 sides well inscribed into @xmath3 and circumscribed to @xmath5 corresponds by duality ( polarity ) to an inscribed polygon into @xmath5 .",

    "following the sides of this inscribed polygon , we have @xmath176 .",
    "we have , in the same way , @xmath177 .",
    "since the inscribed polygon has @xmath1 vertices and not only @xmath4 , these two fixed points of the automorphism @xmath117 do not concide ; indeed they are exchanged by @xmath52 .",

    "it implies that @xmath117 has three fixed points , i.e. @xmath180 .",
    "then , a polygon constructed from a general point @xmath181 by joining the vertices @xmath182 is inscribed in @xmath5 and corresponds by duality to an inscribed polygon in @xmath3 circumscribed around @xmath5 .",
