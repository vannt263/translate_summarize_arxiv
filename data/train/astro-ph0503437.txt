    "blue stragglers ( bss ) are cluster stars having anomalous evolutionary histories .",
    "they are blue stars of intermediate mass ( a few @xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with typical surface temperatures of @xmath1@xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "application of single - star evolution theory indicates an age too young to be explained by the age of their parent cluster ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this apparent paradox has been explained by two production paths for bss : ( i ) collisions between two lower - mass stars ( e.g.  see the simulations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( ii ) mass transfer in moderately wide binary stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "both of these processes are likely to cause the remnant bs to spin up .",
    "population studies of bss have shown that both of these routes may be necessary to account for the observations @xcite .    recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter dm04 ) have presented hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) observations of bs spectra , and have argued that they detect the signature of a circumstellar disc around some of their targets .",
    "disc formation is a common theme in bs generation and hence the dm04 observations could shed light on the different evolutionary processes responsible for these objects .",
    "the evidence advanced for the presence of discs rests largely on an apparent continuum deficit ( by @xmath3@xmath4% ) , falling on the short wavelength side of the balmer discontinuity ; dm04 interpret this deficit  and the corresponding _ enhancement _ in the magnitude of the balmer jump  as arising from circumstellar absorption by the presumed disc .    on account of their putative formation mechanisms ,",
    "bs are expected to exhibit moderate to high rotation rates . in this letter",
    "we investigate the effect of such rapid rotation on the photospheric continuum , by developing a spectral synthesis model that correctly accounts for the oblateness and gravity darkening arising from the centrifugal force .",
    "we describe the model in  [ sec : model ] , and use it in  [ sec : balmer ] to explore the evolution of the balmer jump as the rotation rate is varied . in  [ sec : obs ] we then apply the model to the blue straggler m3 - 17 , demonstrating that it can successfully reproduce the observations by dm04 .",
    "we discuss and summarize our findings in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in a non - rotating , spherical star , the atmosphere across the entire surface may be characterized by a single value each for the effective temperature @xmath5  and gravity @xmath6 . with the introduction of rotation",
    ", however , the outward pull of the centrifugal force distorts the star into an oblate spheroid . across the surface of this spheroid ,",
    "the effective gravity @xmath7  ( composed of the vector sum of the newtonian gravity and the centrifugal acceleration ) is non - uniform , decreasing toward the equatorial regions where the centrifugal force is strongest .",
    "likewise , in accordance with the gravity darkening law of @xcite , the effective temperature decreases toward the equator in accordance with the relation @xmath8 .    to model",
    "such an oblate , gravity - darkened star , we set up a raster grid that divides the surface into c. 14,000 pixels , each covering an area @xmath9 square , where @xmath10  is the star s polar radius .",
    "we calculate the local effective gravity associated with the surface point to which each pixel corresponds , and we likewise assign a local effective temperature @xmath11 following @xcite s law .",
    "the overall normalization of these temperature data is specified by the notional effective temperature @xmath12  that the star would have if it were non - rotating , under the ( reasonably - accurate ) ansatz that the stellar bolometric luminosity remains invariant as the rotation rate changes .",
    "the symbol @xmath13 denotes the surface - area weighted gravity of the distorted star , which depends amongst other things on the rotation rate ( see equations 4.224.24 of * ? ? ?",
    "knowing the effective temperature and gravity of each pixel , and furthermore the local projection cosine @xmath14 of the surface normal onto the line of sight , we interpolate the observer - directed emergent flux in a @xmath5@xmath15@xmath14 grid of precomputed angle - dependent intensity spectra . by co - adding the flux data from all pixels , weighted by their projected area @xmath16 and doppler shifted by the line - of - sight velocity due to rotation , we thereby build up a disc - integrated spectrum for the entire distorted , gravity - darkened star . for the calculations presented in the following section , we adopt an intensity spectrum grid calculated using the synspec spectral synthesis code of i. hubeny and t. lanz .",
    "the spectra incorporate lines due to h , he , c , n , o , si , mg , and ne , and are based on the am20ak2-odfnew grid of line - blanketed lte model atmospheres published by @xcite ( these have h / he = 0.34 by mass and are alpha enhanced by 0.4dex and metal depleted by 2.0dex ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : spectra ] we present synthetic spectra covering the wavelength range 3,2004,500 , calculated for equatorial rotation rates @xmath17 and 0.9 using the model we describe above ; here , @xmath18 is the critical rotation velocity at which the equatorial centrifugal force balances gravity .",
    "the underlying star has a mass @xmath19 , polar radius @xmath20 and ` non - rotating ' effective temperature @xmath21 , these parameters being chosen to coincide with those given by dm04 for the star m3 - 17 . the model star is viewed equator - on , and we normalize all spectra to have a unit flux at 4,200 .",
    "it is clear that the synthetic spectra are all similar longward of the balmer discontinuity at 3,647  ( see below ) but that the magnitude of the jump  which we characterize throughout via the ratio @xmath22 between the continuum fluxes at 4,200  and 3,630  varies noticeably with the rotation rate . in interpreting this behaviour",
    ", we recall that the spectrum of a rotating star is a composite , made up from contributions covering a range of effective temperatures and gravities . to illustrate the sensitivity of the balmer jump against such variation in temperature and gravity , fig .",
    "[ fig : balmer - t - g ] plots @xmath23  as a function of both @xmath5and @xmath15 , for a spectrum synthesized from a non - rotating plane - parallel atmosphere model .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath23  ( left - hand panel ) exhibits a sharp peak around @xmath24 ; at temperatures cooler than this turnover , the appearance of @xmath25  bound - free opacity  which preferentially absorbs continuum photons toward longer wavelengths in the optical and uv ( see , e.g.fig .",
    "8.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* )  tends to suppress the flux redward of the balmer discontinuity , resulting in a reduction of @xmath23 .",
    "likewise , at temperatures hotter than @xmath26 , the progressive depopulation of the @xmath27 ( balmer ground - state ) level of neutral hydrogen removes bound - free continuum opacity blueward of the discontinuity , again resulting in a reduction of @xmath23 .",
    "similar behaviour is exhibited in the gravity dependence of the balmer jump ( right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : balmer - t - g ] ) ; @xmath25  number densities are enhanced at high gravities , due to the corresponding increase in electron density , while @xmath27 level populations are depleted at low gravities , due to the reduction in collisional recombinations which replenish these populations . together",
    ", these processes are responsible for the decline in @xmath23  toward both low and high @xmath6 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : balmer - rot ] , we illustrate how the combined @xmath5/@xmath15 sensitivities of the balmer - jump magnitude come together in a rotating star , by plotting @xmath23  as a function of rotation rate .",
    "we use the same stellar parameters as previously , but in the present case show data for both pole- and equator - on aspects . in each , @xmath23  increases steadily up to a rate @xmath28 , due to the reduction in equatorial effective temperature and gravity from their non - rotating values @xmath29 , @xmath30 . at this point ,",
    "the equatorial reduction of @xmath31 and @xmath7  is so pronounced that the low temperature / gravity regime of @xmath23  is reached , and the magnitude of the balmer jump then decreases rapidly toward even - higher @xmath32 .",
    "however , in every case , @xmath23  for the rotating models is larger than in the non - rotating limit",
    ".    how then does rotation change the flux distribution redward of the balmer jump ? in fig .",
    "[ fig : color - color ] , we present a color - color diagram of the rotating models .",
    "the fluxes in the three photometric bands ( centered at 3660 , 4200  and 5450 ) are averaged over 120 , 80  and 120  widths respectively , and we use the zero - point magnitudes from @xcite  this is exactly the same as the procedure used dm04 to allow a direct comparison to be made . a grid of non - rotating model atmospheres is plotted ( dotted lines ) for temperatures between 8,500k12,000k , and for log@xmath6=2.5 - 5.0 .",
    "also we have calculated pole - on and equator - on rotating atmosphere models ( for @xmath33 = 0.00.9 in steps of 0.1 ) for the [ 4200]-[5450 ] extreme blue edge of the non - rotating grid .",
    "the equator - on models ( filled circles ) sweep down and to the right ( almost appearing like models becoming cooler at constant log@xmath6 ) , with the lower - temperature models eventually sweeping upward in a broad `` u '' shape .",
    "the loci of the pole - on models ( filled squares ) initially move vertically down with increasing rotation ( i.e. no change in the [ 4200]-[5450 ] ) with the cooler models then reversing their track in a `` v '' shape .",
    "the maximum change in [ 3660]-[4200 ] becomes more pronounced for higher temperature models , reaching 0.06mag for the 12,000k model .",
    "two conclusions can be drawn from this figure : first , that for pole - on models , rotation can cause the balmer jump ( signified by the [ 3660]-[4200 ] color ) to be too large whilst keeping the [ 4200]-[5450 ] color constant ; second , if they are rotating , stars can exist with colors which are apparently inconsistent with non - rotating model atmospheres ( i.e. the lower left - hand extremum of the non - rotating atmosphere grid is extended a little ) .",
    "finally we note that the position of a star in the color - color plane does not yield a unique pair of effective temperature and gravity values  two color measurements can not produce three unique values of effective temperature , gravity , and rotation .",
    "the observed projected rotation velocity of m3 - 17 , @xmath34 , along with the stellar parameters furnished by dm04 , implies that this object is a rapid rotator , having @xmath35 .",
    "the balmer jump magnitude derived from the _ hst _ spectrum of this object is @xmath36 , a value that we indicate in fig .",
    "[ fig : balmer - rot ] by the horizontal dashed line . clearly , there are multiple rotating models that can fit the observations , without the need to invoke a circumstellar disc ; for example , a match to @xmath23  can be achieved with an edge - on ( @xmath37 ) model rotating at @xmath38 or 0.9 , and other solutions can be found at lesser inclinations .",
    "we further illustrate this point in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , where we plot the archival spectrum of m3 - 17 over our model data .",
    "the non - rotating synthetic spectrum clearly has a surfeit of continuum flux shortward of the balmer discontinuity , which led dm04 to diagnose the presence of a circumstellar disc .",
    "however , our equator - on rotating models at @xmath39 and 0.9 clearly provide a good fit to the continuum flux , suggesting that rotation alone may suffice to explain the balmer jump .",
    "in support of this conclusion , we note that the rotational reddening of the paschen continuum , as seen for the equator - on curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : color - color ] , actually enables the rotating models to fit the observed [ 4200]-[5450 ] color of m3 - 17 _ better _ than the non - rotating model of the same temperature .",
    "we do observe that our models are unable to reproduce the strengths of the balmer - series absorption lines seen redward of 3,647 ; this problem reflects the fact that we specify the model temperature _ a priori _ from that of dm04 .",
    "the issue can be resolved by allowing @xmath12  ( and other parameters ) to vary under the control of a suitably - chosen fitting statistic .",
    "however , we do not undertake such fine tuning here , because we are not attempting to derive exact atmospheric parameters for m3 - 17 here .",
    "rather , our objective is to highlight that high rotation has a significant effect on the continuum , and may mimic the presence of an obscuring disk .",
    "using a spectral synthesis approach that correctly treats oblateness and gravity darkening , we have demonstrated that apparent flux deficits shortward of the balmer discontinuity can be attributed wholly to rapid rotation .",
    "this casts doubt on the disc hypothesis advanced by @xcite to explain the balmer jump anomalies seen in the spectra of bss . at least in the case of rapid rotator m3 - 17 ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the continuum is well fit by our model , leaving little reason to invoke the presence of a disc .",
    "in addition to m3 - 17 , five other stars ( out of a total of 50 ) in the dm04 sample show balmer jumps that are enhanced with respect to non - rotating models . of these five , only ngc6751 - 11 has a measured ( upper limit ) projected rotation velocity , @xmath41 . due to the unknown projection factor @xmath42 ,",
    "the upper limit on the intrinsic equatorial velocity @xmath32  may be much larger , and it is entirely possible that , along with the remaining objects with anomalous balmer jumps , this star is a rapid rotator .    accordingly",
    ", balmer jump anomalies seen in bss may _ all _ be attributable to rapid rotation .",
    "this hypothesis is lent some support by the fact that the proposed formation mechanisms for bss  collisions or mass transfer  both involve the deposition of significant amounts of angular momentum on the star , thereby spinning it up ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on a final note , we stress that we do not ( and can not ) rule out the possibility of discs around bss .",
    "indeed , observations of emission lines in these objects , bearing a close resemblance to those seen in be stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicate that there almost certainly _ are _ circumstellar discs around some of them .",
    "however , the present paper demonstrated why balmer jump anomalies can not be used as a clear and unambiguous diagnostic for bs discs .      , m. , fusi pecci , f. , messineo , m. , monaco , l. , & rood , r.  t. 2002 , , 123 , 1509 , m.s . ,",
