    "a quantum quench is an abrupt change in the state of a system due to changes in the potential energy terms of its schrdinger hamiltonian . for an intarcting system",
    "such a quantum quench can occur in the external confinement term , or in the interparticle terms . both seem to be feasible in modern experiments @xcite on trapped systems . since , in general , the _ interparticle _ interaction is responsible for dynamic correlation , beyond any statistics - mediated ( exchange ) correlation , its tuning is of special interest .",
    "equally importantly , advances in optical trapping of cold atoms have allowed for an unprecedented manipulation over the size of these quantum systems such that the _ number _ of atoms beeing trapped can be precisely specified @xcite .",
    "clearly , exactly solvable entangled two - particle models could serve as benchmark systems @xcite to test the capability of approximate many - body methods in the time domain .",
    "recently , motivated by the obvious theoretical interest on the fine details of informations , proposals have been made @xcite about measuring entanglement in cold atom systems based on the interference between copies .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next , introductory section is devoted to a summary of the stationary model in order to provide a useful background .",
    "section iii contains the time - dependent extension .",
    "the particular case where the abrupt change is made in the interparticle interaction is analyzed in details .",
    "atomic units are used .",
    "motivated by the really challenging interplay among hamiltonian - based quantities and information - theory - based measures , we first summarize the stationary ( i.e. , time - independent ) background to our present study . as our unquenched system , we take the interacting model system @xcite first introduced by heisenberg as one of the really simplest ( `` das denkbar einfachste mehrkrperproblem '' ) many - body models @xmath0 where @xmath1 measures the strength of the interparticle interaction energy in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "the repulsive ( @xmath3 ) and attractive ( @xmath4 ) interactions refer to @xmath5}}$ ] and @xmath6 .",
    "the restricted range for @xmath7 will be clarified below .",
    "physically , for @xmath8 , both interacting particles can not both remain in the confining external field .",
    "introducing standard normal coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 , one can easily rewrite the unperturbed hamiltonian into the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the frequencies of the independent normal modes . based on eq.(2 ) , the normalized ground - state wave function @xmath14 is the product @xmath15\\ ,   \\left(\\frac{\\omega_2}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/4}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_2\\ , x_{2}^2\\right].\\ ] ] we stress at this point that the price of this normal - mode transformation is that one loses the intuitive physical picture of real particles and , instead , operates with _ effective _ particles representing the transformed coordinates . since their frequencies are different one can not reinterpret them as quasiparticles , at least within the famous landau s picture .    before turning to the reduced one - particle density matrix , a key quantity in our analysis ,",
    "we introduce here a more conventional measure of interparticle correlation by calculating the overlap-_square _ @xmath16 .",
    "the result becomes @xmath17 with the separated form for our model one obtains the same expression , @xmath18 , from an other overlap defined by interchanging ( formally @xmath19 ) the coordinates of _ effective _ particles in eq.(3 ) , i.e. , from @xmath20 .    by rewriting the wave function @xmath14 in terms of physical coordinates",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 , we determine the one - matrix @xmath23 via the following nonlinear mapping @xmath24 from this , we arrive at a very informative , jastrow - like @xcite , representation @xmath25 ^ 2}}\\ ] ] where , with @xmath26 , we introduced the following abbreviations @xmath27^{1/4}\\ , e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_s\\ , x^2}\\ ] ] @xmath28 the diagonal of @xmath23 gives the one - particle probability density , @xmath29 , of unit - norm , which is the basic quantity of the mean - field density functional theory ( dft ) . however , if we neglect the role of the relative coordinate by taking @xmath30 in eq.(6 ) , we get an idempotent one - matrix @xcite . in dft a density - optimal auxiliary orbital , @xmath31 , is occupied with unit probability .",
    "the double fourier transform @xcite of the one - dimensional one - matrix in eq.(6 ) gives the momentum - dependent one - matrix .",
    "after integrations we get @xmath32 the diagonal component of @xmath33 is the normalized one - body momentum distribution function and its application gives the _ exact _ kinetic energy of the system : @xmath34 .",
    "clearly , by using the virial theorem for bounded systems with harmonic interactions , one gets the exact ground - state energy as well .",
    "since one has access to @xmath33 by compton scattering , it is an observable encoding information on entanglement .",

    "it says that two measures of probabilistic nature are equal in our entangled model system .",
    "if one of them , say the overlap , could be accessible experimentally @xcite , we could characterize the other one as well .",
    "the purity rests on an operator-_square _ , and is calculable directly from knowledge of the coordinate - representation of the one - particle reduced density matrix .",
    "however , for a compact spectral analysis @xcite of correlation one needs @xmath39 $ ] for noninteger @xmath40 values as well .",
    "based on them one can calculate rnyi s and von neumann s entropies @xcite .",

    "the @xmath44 decomposition - functions form a complete set of orthonormal eigenfunctions of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator with potential energy @xmath45 in the schrdinger wave equation and are given by @xmath46 comparison of exponentials in eq.(6 ) and eq.(12 ) results in the two constraints @xmath47 @xmath48 one can solve the algebraic equations easily for @xmath49 and @xmath50 in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "( 16 ) that @xmath55 , i.e. , there is a duality @xcite under the constraint of @xmath56 .",
    "thus , under this constraint at stationary condition , probabilistic measures alone can not reproduce the _ sign _ of the interparticle interaction .    since @xmath57 from eqs.(14 - 15 ) , we obtain a point - wise , closed - shell - like expansion for the one - particle reduced density matrix @xmath58 where the occupation numbers of the so - called natural orbitals , @xmath44 , are @xmath59 and we have @xmath60 . in the knowledge of occupation numbers ,",

    "thus , a desirable @xcite spectral analysis of information - theoretic measures becomes feasible .",
    "for instance , as a useful check , we get @xmath63 this series exhibits useful connections between physical and auxiliary variables .",

    "here one has a simple free expansion without oscillation . in other quenches , we expect characteristicly oscillating wave functions and corresponding probability measures .",
    "however , and this is very important from physical point of view , the period of these oscillations will now depend on the sign of the interparticle interactions .",

    "based on heisenberg s two - particle model hamiltonian which constitutes a cornerstone in such areas of physics , as the fundamental fields of correlated atoms and confined quantum matter , a detailed analysis of entanglement measures is performed using the exact decomposition of a time - dependent one - matrix obtained by abrupt changes in the coupling of the interparticle interaction energy . in the exact spectral representation of the one - matrix the natural orbitals and their occupation numbers depend on time , as expected .",

    "exactly solvable two - particle models of controllably trapped systems can serve as benchmarks in the challenging field dealing with encoded informations in correlated systems .",

    "further research , based on other two - body model systems with harmonic confinement but with different interparticle intaraction , is desirable for a detailed comparison and , as a main goal of such research , to provide a transferable knowledge .",

    "<S> we determine the exact time - dependent non - idempotemt one - particle reduced density matrix and its spectral decomposition for a harmonically confined two - particle correlated one - dimensional system when the interaction terms in the schrdinger hamiltonian are changed abruptly . </S>",
    "<S> based on this matrix in coordinate space we derive a precise condition for the equivalence of the purity and the overlap - square of the correlated and non - correlated wave functions as the system evolves in time . </S>",
    "<S> this equivalence holds only if the interparticle interactions are affected , while the confinement terms are unaffected within the stability range of the system . under this condition </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze various time - dependent measures of entanglement and demonstrate that , depending on the magnitude of the changes made in the schrdinger hamiltonian , periodic , logarithmically incresing or constant value behavior of the von neumann entropy can occur . </S>"
