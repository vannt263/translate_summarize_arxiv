    "understanding virus structures is a rich and challenging problem  @xcite , with a wealth of new information now becoming available .",
    "although traditional x - ray crystallography still allows the most detailed analysis  @xcite , three - dimensional reconstructions of icosahedral viruses from cryo - electron micrographs are now becoming routine  @xcite .",
    "electron microscope images of many identical viruses in a variety of orientations are used to reconstruct a three - dimensional image on a computer , similar to ct ( computed tomography ) scans in medical imaging .",
    "there are now , in addition , beautiful single molecule experiments which measure the work needed to load a virus ( bacteriophage @xmath629 ) with its dna package  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the elastic parameters and physical ideas which determine the shapes of viruses with an icosahedral symmetry , using the theory of thin elastic shells  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of approximately spherical viruses dates back to pioneering work by crick and watson in 1956  @xcite , who argued that the small size of the viral genome requires identical structural units packed together with an icosahedral symmetry .",
    "these principles were put on a firm basis by caspar and klug in 1962  @xcite , who showed how the proteins in a viral shell ( the `` capsid '' ) could be viewed as icosadeltahedral triangulations of the sphere by a set of pentavalent and hexavalent morphological units ( `` capsomers '' ) . the viral shells ( there can also be an outer envelope composed of additional proteins and membrane elements from the host cell ) are characterized by a pair of integers @xmath7 such that the number of morphological units is @xmath8 . to get from one pentavalent capsomer to another ,",
    "one moves @xmath9 capsomers along a row of near - neighbor bonds on the sphere , turns 120 degrees and moves another @xmath10 steps .",
    "euler s theorem relating the number of vertices , edges and faces of a spherical triangulation insures that the number of capsomers in five - fold environments is exactly 12  @xcite .",
    "a simple icosahedron of 12 morphological units corresponds to ( 1,0 ) while soccer balls and c@xmath11 fullerene molecules are ( 1,1 ) structures with @xmath12 polygons .",

    "[ fig:2]b ) .",
    "faceting of large viruses is in fact a common phenomenon ; the protein subunits of different viruses , moreover , are very similar ( see below ) .",
    "if these protein assemblies are characterized by elastic constants and a bending rigidity  @xcite , we can ask how deviations from a spherical shape develop with increasing virus radius , which scales roughly as the square root of the number of morphological units .",
    "the polyoma virus ( a ) is approximately spherical , while the larger adenovirus ( b ) is more faceted ( not to scale ) .",
    "images from ref .  @xcite . ]    in support of the idea that viruses with different overall capsid size are composed of nearly identical monomers , we note that most viral coat and capsid proteins have about the same size , molecular weight , amino acid composition and , most importantly , the same folded structure in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "it is known , moreover , that protein structure determines the mechanical properties of proteins  @xcite .",
    "hence , the similarity of the protein structure of the coat / capsid proteins suggests similar mechanical properties .",
    "in addition , the presence of the same fold of capsid proteins in unrelated viruses ( bacterial phages , plant viruses , insect viruses and animal viruses ) indicate that the fold and its mechanical properties are conserved in evolution and could be essential for proper virus assembly .    in this paper , we argue that the faceting of large viruses is caused by a buckling transition associated with the 12 isolated points of 5-fold symmetry .",
    "these singularities can be viewed as disclinations in an otherwise 6-coordinated medium .",
    "it is well known that the large strains associated with an isolated disclination in a _ flat _",
    "disk spanned by a triangular lattice leads to buckling into a conical shape for  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath1 is the two - dimensional young s modulus , @xmath2 is the bending rigidity and @xmath3 is the disk radius .",
    "the energy of a single 5-fold disclination with `` charge '' @xmath16 centered in a flat array of proteins of size @xmath3 is approximately @xmath17 however , above a critical buckling radius @xmath18 , is there a conical deformation ( see fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) such that the disclination energy now only grows logarithmically with @xmath3 @xmath19 one might expect a similar phenomenon for 12 disclinations confined to a surface with a _ spherical _ topology .",

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , namely  @xcite @xmath20 where the sphere radius @xmath3 now plays the role of the system size .",
    "although it seems highly likely that these 12 disclinations can lower their energy by buckling for large @xmath3 , the nonlinear nature of the underlying elastic theory  @xcite leads to complex interactions between the resulting conical deformations .",
    "a boundary layer analysis of the von krmn equations for bent plates predicts anomalous scaling for the mean curvature in the vicinity of the ridges connecting conical singularities  @xcite .",
    "interesting scaling behavior also arises in the vicinity of the apexes of the cones themselves  @xcite .",
    "another interesting physical realization of the buckling problem lies in the faceting of lecithin vesicles at temperatures sufficiently low so that the lipid constituents have crystallized  @xcite .",
    "the fivefold disclination in a triangular lattice . in viruses",
    ", the points would correspond to capsomeres , while in lecithin vesicles they correspond to lipid molecules .",

    "is shown in ( b ) . ]    in this paper , we study the ground states of crystalline particle arrays with 12 disclinations in a spherical geometry .",
    "we find that there are indeed striking manifestations of the buckling transition even in the curved geometry of viral capsids or crystalline vesicles .",
    "the nonlinear foppl - von krmn equations for thin shells with elasticity and a bending energy are solved using a floating mesh discretization developed and studied extensively in the context of `` tethered surface '' models of polymerized membranes  @xcite . by taking the nodes of the mesh to coincide with the capsomers ,",
    "even small viruses can be handled in this way , although any buckling transition will surely be smeared out unless @xmath22 is large , where @xmath23 is the spacing between these morphological units .",
    "ideas from continuum elastic theory will , of course , be most applicable for vesicles composed of many lipids and for large viruses  viruses with as many as 1692 morphological units have been reported  @xcite .",
    "there may be inherent limitations on the size of viral capsids that follow from the elastic properties of thin shells . because larger viruses can accommodate more genetic material",
    ", large sizes could confer an evolutionary advantage .",
    "if , however , large viruses buckle away from a spherical shape , the resistance of the capsid to mechanical deformation can degrade . as we shall see",
    ", a theory of buckled crystalline order on spheres also allows estimates of important macroscopic elastic parameters of the capsid shell from structural data on the shape anisotropy .",
    "estimates of quantities such as the bending rigidity and young s modulus of a empty viral shell might allow an understanding of deformations due to loading with dna or rna @xcite .",
    "although some aspects of virus structure may be accounted for by the physics of shell theory , we should emphasize that other features could be driven by the need for cell recognition , avoidance of immune response , etc .",

    "the energy , mean - square aspherity , and spherical harmonic content of these shells are determined as a function of the foppl - von krmn number , discussed above , @xmath33 most viruses have either foppl - von krmn number @xmath34 ( implying a close to spherical shape ) or @xmath35 ( noticeably buckled ) .",
    "higher von krmn numbers describing objects with very sharp corners can not be obtained for viruses with @xmath36 m composed of finite size proteins .",
    "of course , very high von krmn numbers _ are _",

    "iii , we discuss briefly the relevance of our work to icosahedral viruses from the library of those whose structures have been determined by diffraction methods or by cryro - electron microscopy  @xcite . for viruses large enough to buckle , the model seems to account well for the deviation from the spherical shape using the single adjustable parameter @xmath4 .",
    "these fits in turn provide information about the ratio @xmath26 of the young s modulus to the bending rigidity .",
    "we also discuss the possible relevance of spontaneous curvature terms and outward pressure induced by packaged dna and rna in this section .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of similar issues for the shapes of liquid membranes with a spherical topology .",
    "topological defects play a very important role in crystalline matter .",
    "a particularly common type of defect , the dislocation , is largely responsible for the strength of materials , and in two - dimensional systems the unbinding of dislocations may drive the crystal into a hexatic phase  @xcite .",
    "disclinations on the other hand , are much less common in the crystalline phase because of their very large energy . in quasi - two - dimensional curved surfaces , however , the situation may be quite different",
    ". the gaussian curvature of the surface will `` screen '' out the strain around the defect and thus lower the energy .",
    "moreover , when a crystalline surface is bent to form a closed surface with spherical topology , defects are necessarily introduced into the lattice . for a triangular lattice on a sphere",
    "the number of disclinations has to be at least 12 .",
    "more generally , the difference @xmath39 between the number of fivefold disclinations and the number of sevenfold disclinations ( assuming defects with coordination numbers other than 5 , 6 or 7 are absent ) is precisely 6 times the euler characteristic @xmath40 of the triangulated surface , i.e. , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the genus or number of handles .",
    "thus for shapes such that @xmath43 ( the sphere ) and torii with extra handles @xmath44 , the ground state must necessarily contain disclinations .",
    "( a simple torus has genus @xmath45 , so there is no topological necessity for defects . )    in this section we study closed surfaces of spherical topology .",
    "the 12 disclinations present in the crystalline lattice structure can be expected to dominate the energetics and affect the overall shape of the structure .",
    "the repulsive interaction between the 12 disclinations will favor an arrangement which maximizes their separation . absent an instability toward grain boundaries  @xcite",
    ", this leads to a configuration with icosahedral symmetry , where the disclinations sit at the vertices .",
    "we show below that , as a result of competition between strain and bending energies , these structures may undergo a buckling - like transition ( smeared by finite size effects ) from a smooth round shape to a sharply faceted shape as the size or elastic constants are varied .",
    "we assume a thin shell described by a continuum elastic theory , with energy @xmath46",
    "@xcite , including both an in - plane stretching energy , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the strain tensor , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the 2d lam coefficients , and a bending energy , @xmath51 where @xmath2 is the bending rigidity , @xmath52 the gaussian rigidity , @xmath53 and @xmath54 the mean and gaussian curvatures , respectively .",

    "we will use the 2d young s modulus @xmath1 and the poisson ratio @xmath59 , which are given by @xmath60 taking the variation of @xmath61 with respect to coordinates parameterizing the surface leads to the foppl - von krmn equations which are highly nonlinear and whose solution even in simple geometries is very difficult  @xcite .",
    "the energy of disclinations on flexible crystalline membranes was studied by seung and nelson in ref .",
    "@xcite . as discussed in the introduction , for a thin flat plate of finite radius @xmath3 with an isolated 5-fold disclination at the center , the energy grows quadratically with the radius , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a numerical constant .",
    "if the disclination is allowed to buckle out of the plane this energy is reduced , and grows logarithmically for large @xmath3 with a coefficient proportional to @xmath2 . in the inextensional limit @xmath64 the problem simplifies considerably and the energy is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath23 the lattice constant .",
    "thus , for small plates the flat solution is lower in energy , whereas for large plates the buckled solution wins .",
    "an instability separating these two regimes occurs when @xmath67 , or @xmath68 .",
    "a detailed calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite found the transition at a critical value of @xmath69 .",
    "the spherical shapes of icosahedral symmetry we are interested in here can approximately be thought of as being composed of 12 disclinations , and should therefore undergo a similar transition from flat to buckled . because the surface of the sphere is already curved , and hence breaks the up - down symmetry that was present for a thin plate , it is not clear that a sharp instability survives in this case .",
    "however , even if this is the case , we might still expect to see remnants of the transition in the form of a sharp if not singular crossover .",
    "we construct below simple estimates of the energies and transitions involved .",
    "the total energy of the closed shell in the vicinity of the transition is approximately 12 times the energy of a disclination ( with radius approximately equal to the radius of the sphere ) , plus contributions from the background curvature of a sphere , given approximately by @xmath70 . in the inextensional limit the short distance cutoff in the buckled disclination energy",
    "was provided by the lattice constant . for finite @xmath1",
    "the cutoff is determined instead by a balance of strain and bending .",
    "we may in this case approximate the buckled disclination by a flat inner region @xmath71 with energy @xmath72 and an outer buckled region @xmath73 with energy @xmath74 . minimizing the sum with respect to @xmath75 gives @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .    because the disclination energy is independent of the two - dimensional poisson ratio and the gaussian rigidity drops out , the solution depends only on a single dimensionless parameter , @xmath78 , which we term the foppl - von krmn number .",
    "note that , if the 2d elastic theory derives from a thin shell of finite thickness @xmath79 built from a 3d isotropic elastic medium , we have @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the three - dimensional poisson ratio , a result independent of the 3d young s modulus @xmath82  @xcite . in summary , we then expect the energy of the closed shell with twelve disclinations to approximately be @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "the background curvature gives a constant contribution @xmath85 , leading as well to a small shift in the disclination energies and hence in @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "for a perfect sphere , e.g. , @xmath88",
    "@xcite .",
    "as the disclinations become more sharply buckled the whole structure will become more faceted .",
    "this leads to the formation of ridges connecting the vertices of the icosahedron .",
    "the energy of similar ridges has been studied recently  @xcite , uncovering some remarkable scaling relations .",
    "as the ridges become sharper upon increasing @xmath4 , the energy will increase as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the angle in radians and @xmath91 is the length of the ridge . in this regime",

    "note that @xmath164_\\mathrm{hk97 } = 1.64 $ ] nm@xmath165 , consistent with the arguments given in the introduction that spherical viruses have roughly similar elastic constants .",
    "our models for virus shells are based on two important assumptions .",
    "the first is the neglect of a spontaneous curvature term  @xcite in bending energies such as eq .",
    ". such a term might be significant if the viral building blocks had a pronounced conical shape similar to , say , surfactant molecules in a micelle  @xcite or laboratory cork stoppers .",
    "several lines of evidence suggest that neglect of this term might be justified .",
    "although certain virus scaffolding proteins ( which can act as templates for early phases of construction ) do have a conical shape , these are discarded in the mature icosahedral viruses of interest to us here  @xcite .",
    "it is hard to see a strong mechanism for precisely - defined hinge angles in very large viruses composed of many capsomers  @xcite . in vitro assembly experiments on the polyoma virus",
    "do produce spherical aggregates with 12 , 24 and 72 pentameric units depending on conditions of ph , calcium concentration , etc  @xcite , which could be accounted for by a spontaneous curvature term .",
    "although we neglect spontaneous curvature here , it is certainly possible that the physics of small viruses ( or the scaffolding proteins themselves ) are influenced by such an energy , as has been explored by bruinsma , rudnick and gelbart  @xcite .",
    "in general our work is more likely to be applicable to _ large _ viruses , for which simple continuum models can be justified .",
    "icosahedral viruses are usually composed of a combination of 5- and 6-fold symmetric packing units , with the twelve 5-fold units centered on the vertices of an icosahedron ( the polyoma virus sv40  @xcite with its 72 identical pentamers is an exception ) . because the strain energies which lead to buckling extend far from the disclinations which produce them  @xcite , we would expect our results for large viruses to be insensitive to differences in the shapes of packing elements .",
    "special packing elements at the twelve 5-fold sites could be incorporated into a disclination core energy .",
    "a second key assumption is our neglect of the osmotic pressure due to the confined dna or rna package of the virus  @xcite .",
    "here we can appeal to an experiment .",
    "earnshaw and harrison  @xcite have compared the structure of phage lambda ( p22 ) with its full complement of dna to the structure of lambda mutants containing only 78% of the native dna .",
    "although changes in the details of dna packing can be detected , the protein shell itself is unchanged .",
    "thus , due either to dna condensation or an exceptionally strong shell , the osmotic pressure of the dna is insufficient to change the shape",
    ". of course , the nucleic acid content of a virus could nevertheless play an important role in shell assembly  @xcite .",
