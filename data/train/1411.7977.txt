    "quantum entanglement  @xcite , which is an intrinsically and fundamentally nonclassical effect , has attracted an enormous number of works related to quantum information processing and quantum engineering in the last two decades ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "although , our understanding of quantum entanglement is much deeper now , there are still many open fundamental problems as listed , e.g. , in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "some of these problems address the question how to experimentally detect and estimate entanglement of a given state  @xcite .",
    "one could think that the most natural and simplest way to measure the entanglement of an unknown state of @xmath1 is to apply quantum state tomography ( qst ) .",
    "this approach enables the reconstruction of @xmath1 by postprocessing experimental data , and , then , the calculation of arbitrary entanglement measures for @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , various effective qst methods have been developed  @xcite , including those for the reconstruction of the polarization states of two photons ( for a recent comparison see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless , this complete reconstruction requires to measure also a large number of parameters , which are irrelevant for the determination of entanglement .",
    "this number scales with the square of the dimension of a measured state @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , qst based on linear inversion often leads to unphysical reconstructed states .",
    "then , nonlinear methods ( based , e.g. , on maximum - likelihood estimation ) have to be applied to overcome this problem .",
    "thus , usually , entanglement is detected and quantified by measuring entanglement witnesses  @xcite ( for a review see ref .",
    "this approach corresponds to testing the violations of classical inequalities",
    ". the operational usefulness of entanglement witnesses has been demonstrated in numerous experimental ( see , e.g. , earlier experiments reported in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and theoretical works .",
    "the latter include approaches based on : polynomial moments  @xcite , collective entanglement witnesses  @xcite , experimental adaptive witnesses  @xcite , and others ( see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "some of such studies of entanglement witnesses were focused on the quantitative description of entanglement ( see , e.g. , recent refs .",
    "@xcite and a review  @xcite for older references ) .",
    "for example , a lower bound on a generic entanglement measure can be derived from the mean value of entanglement witnesses based on the legendre transform  @xcite .",
    "the estimation of the concurrence and/or negativity from entanglement witnesses was studied in , e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the violation of a bell inequality , which is also an entanglement witness , can be used to estimate the concurrence  @xcite , the negativity  @xcite , or the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree )  @xcite .",
    "a related problem is the estimation of one entanglement measure from another entanglement measure , e.g. , the concurrence from negativity  @xcite and the ree  @xcite , the negativity from the ree  @xcite , or vice versa .",
    "these approaches based on entanglement witnesses are useful and efficient , but still their usage is limited , because some information about the state should be known prior to its measurement .    in this paper",
    ", we study a universal entanglement witness ( uwe ) , which can be used as a sufficient and necessary test of the entanglement of a two - qubit system .",
    "the uwe is defined as the determinant of a partially - transformed density matrix , @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this witness can be given as a function of the moments @xmath3 $ ]  @xcite , which are directly measurable , as recently described in ref .",
    "@xcite for a linear - optical setup .",
    "the proposed setup is based on the experimental methods described and referenced in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we address the problem of applying the uwe to quantify two - qubit entanglement .",
    "namely , the question is whether the uwe ( or more precisely , its negative expectation value ) can be considered a good entanglement measure .",
    "we will show that this is not the case for arbitrary two - qubit states .",
    "however , we will identify various classes of states for which the uwe is indeed a good entanglement measure .",
    "moreover , as one of the main results of this paper , we will demonstrate that the negativity can be given as a function of the experimentally - accessible moments @xmath4 .",
    "we will also discuss how the imperfect measurements of @xmath4 deteriorate the estimation of the negativity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the uwe is defined via experimentally - accessible moments @xmath4 of a given partially - transposed density matrix .",
    "we also show the relation between the entanglement witness and makhlin s invariants . in sec .",
    "iii , we present one of the main results of our paper , which is the explicit formula of the negativity as a function of the experimentally - accessible moments @xmath4 . in sec .",
    "iv , we demonstrate that the uwe can be considered a useful entanglement measure . in sec .",
    "v , we show the relation between the entanglement witness and the concurrence for an important class of two - qubit states , namely , the @xmath0-states .",
    "our results are summarized in sec .",
    "vi , as well as tables  i and  ii .",
    "arguably , the simplest two - qubit separability condition can be formulated as follows  @xcite : a two - qubit state @xmath5 is entangled if and only if @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the partially - transposed ( marked by @xmath8 ) matrix @xmath5 .",
    "this theorem can be easily shown by recalling that the partially - transposed matrix of an arbitrary entangled two - qubit state has full rank and has exactly one negative eigenvalue .",
    "thus , one can introduce the uwe @xmath9 for a two - qubit state @xmath5 defined as an operator for which the expected value is equal to @xmath2 .",
    "this witness can also be given in terms of the experimentally - accessible moments @xmath10 $ ] as follows  @xcite : @xmath11 for convenience , we call the uwe not only the observable @xmath9 but also its expectation value @xmath12 .",
    "( this convention is also used in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in order to directly measure the uwe",
    "one could perform joint measurements on the four copies @xmath13 of a two - qubit state @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "a direct and efficient method for the measurement of @xmath14 has been recently proposed for polarization qubits in a linear optical setup  @xcite .",
    "the witness @xmath9 , contrary to a typical entanglement witness , is invariant under local unitary operations , which follows from the invariance of the moments of the partially - transposed density matrix that forms the witness .",
    "this invariance is a key requirement of a good entanglement measure ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that the moments @xmath4 , in eq .",
    "( [ witness ] ) for @xmath15 , are not independent . to show the connection between these moments , let us analyze them in terms of the correlation matrix @xmath16 , with elements @xmath17 $ ] , and the bloch vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with elements @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the matrices @xmath22 for @xmath23 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath24 is the single - qubit identity matrix . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can write the first four moments as @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the functions of nine out of the eighteen makhlin invariants @xcite , i.e. , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "the invariants are also a subset of 21 fundamental and independent two - qubit invariants described by king and welsh in ref .",
    "this demonstrates explicitly that , in general , in order to measure the uwe one needs to measure these nine fundamental physical quantities ( invariants ) .",
    "any function of invariants is also an invariant .",
    "we can , therefore , introduce the following six independent invariants that need to be measured to estimate the values of moments @xmath4 for @xmath15 .",
    "these invariants are @xmath37 this means that in order to quantify entanglement via the uwe , one needs to measure exactly six instead of nine independent quantities .",
    "the number of necessary measurements is by 10 smaller than the number of measurements needed for a full quantum - state tomography .",
    "we can conjecture that this is the minimum number of independent measurements needed for estimating the entanglement of an arbitrary two - qubit state .",

    "the task of finding @xmath41 is usually not easy because the operation of partial transposition is not physical , so this operator can only be implemented approximately .",
    "there is another approach based on measuring moments @xmath42 of the partially - transposed matrix @xmath7 of a two - qubit state @xmath5 .",
    "it has recently been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that all the four first moments @xmath4 can be measured directly using at most four copies of the investigated two - qubit state .",
    "this was shown on the example of the measurement of a two - photon polarization state by using a linear - optical setup .",
    "we note that this approach of ref .",
    "@xcite can be generalized to other implementations of qubits and various setups .",
    "the first two moments @xmath4 are equivalent to the trace and purity of @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "an efficient method for measuring the purity of an arbitrary polarization state of two photons has been proposed recently in ref .",
    "the higher - order moments @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be measured as described in ref .",
    "let us also mention that , as long as there is some entanglement , @xmath7 has four nonzero eigenvalues , among which only one is negative and equals to @xmath41 .",
    "this property holds for an arbitrary two - qubit state  @xcite .",
    "let us derive an expression for the negativity in terms of the experimentally - accessible moments @xmath4 for @xmath47 .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : mu ] ) has an important consequence , i.e. , we can calculate the negativity @xmath52 after measuring @xmath4 for @xmath53 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite measuring these four experimentally - accessible moments can be done more efficiently than performing full quantum state tomography .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : mu ] ) is a fourth degree polynomial in @xmath52 , which after simplification reads @xmath54 in our opinion this is one of the main results of this work .",
    "we can be sure that it has solutions if @xmath55 ( i.e. , when the state @xmath5 is entangled ) .",
    "the solutions can be found analytically by applying the well - known ferrari and cardano formulae .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : n ] ) has four solutions , however there is only one real solution where @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the value of the negativity is uniquely defined by eq .",
