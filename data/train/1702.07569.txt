    "<S> a majority part of magnetic chemically peculiar ( mcp ) stars of the upper main sequence exhibits strictly periodic light , magnetic , radio , and spectral variations that can be fully explained by the model of a rigidly rotating main - sequence star with persistent surface structures and stable global magnetic field frozen into the body of the star . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there is an inhomogeneous group consisting of a few mcp stars whose rotation periods vary on timescales of decades , while the shapes of their phase curves remain nearly unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> alternations in the rotational period variations , proven in the case of some of them , offer new insight on this theoretically unpredicted phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> we present a novel and generally applicable method of period analysis based on the simultaneous exploitation of all available observational data containing phase information . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenological method can monitor gradual changes in the observed instantaneous period very efficiently and reliably . </S>",
    "<S> we present up to date results of the period monitoring of v901  ori , cu  vir , @xmath0orie , and bs  cir , known to be mcp stars changing their observed periods and discuss the physics of this unusual behaviour . to compare the period behavior of those stars </S>",
    "<S> , we treated their data with an orthogonal polynomial model , which was specifically developed for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed period variations in all stars and showed that they reflect real changes in the angular velocity of outer layers of the stars , fastened by their global magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> however , the nature of the observed rotational instabilities has remained elusive up to now . </S>",
    "<S> the discussed group of mcp stars is inhomogeneous to such extent that each of the stars may experience a different cause for its period variations . </S>"
