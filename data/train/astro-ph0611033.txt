    "its aftermath may be observed as long as there are astronomers on earth .",
    "sn  1987a was classified as a type  ii supernova ( sn  ii ) in view of the strong hydrogen lines in its optical spectrum , but because it was the explosion of a blue supergiant ( bsg ) rather than a red one ( rsg ) , it was an atypical sn  ii : its light curve did not reach maximum until three months after core collapse and at maximum it was only about 10  percent as luminous as most sne  ii . for reviews of sn  1987a",

    "unfortunately , the observational record of sk  -69  202 is limited , partly because no spectral peculiarities or variability called attention to sk  -69  202 during the decades prior to its demise .    only serendipitous or",

    "morgan et  al . ( 1954 ) showed that faint ob stars and very red stars could be easily detected on 103a  f plates using objective prisms that give ultralow dispersion of 30,000    mm@xmath2 .",

    "bappu , parthasarathy , & scaria ( 1977 , 1978 , 1985 ) used this method to detect very red stars in selected regions of the lmc , and parthasarathy & jain ( 1995 ) applied it to detect cool and reddened stars in cyg  ob2 .",
    "the instrument ( bappu & parthasarathy 1977 ) used was an f/2 slitless spectrograph with a three  degree quartz prism and a schmidt camera at the cassegrain focus of the 1m ritchey  chretien reflector at vbo .",
    "the field of view was 40 arcminutes in diameter .",
    "spectra covering the wavelength range 3500 to 6600    were obtained on kodak 103a - e emulsion .",

    "it is clear that one can easily distinguish between ob stars and very red stars .",
    "the discontinuity in the spectrum is due to the dip in the sensitivity of the 103a  e emulsion in the green , which serves as a wavelength reference to distinguish the blue part of the spectrum from the red . for example",
    "notice the difference in the spectra of the b star and the k and m stars .",
    "observations of several selected regions of the lmc obtained between 1974 and 1976 and the detection of red stars in the lmc can be found in bappu et  al .",

    "the region of the lmc observed in 1974 in which sk  -69  202 is present is shown in figure  2 .",
    "this region also includes the nearby sk  -69  203 , a b0.7  i star with @xmath4 ( isserstedt 1975 ; rousseau et  al . 1978 ; walborn et  al .",
    "1989 ) , quite similar to sk  -69  202 and possibly associated with it .",
    "the ultralow  dispersion spectrum of sk  -69  202 shows that it was a b star in 1974 .",
    "comparison of densities in different sections of the images of sk  -69  202 and sk  -69  203 indicates that the magnitude and colors of sk  -69  202 were similar to that of sk  -69  203 , in agreement with the ubv photometry and spectral classification .",
    "all data discussed above indicate that from 1971 to 1983 sk  -69  202 showed the characteristics of a normal b3  i star , with no evidence for variability , no balmer  line emission , and no noticeable reddening or near  ir excess .",
    "( walborn et  al . 1989 ) . from the spectra presented by walborn",
    "we estimate that the rotational velocity may not be more than 100 km s@xmath2 .",
    "sk  -69  202 was a normal b3  i supergiant shortly before exploding .",
    "sn  1987a has three circumstellar rings that are part of a complex system of gas that appears to have been ejected by the progenitor some 20,000 years before sk  -69  202 exploded ( burrows et al .",
    "1995 ; sugerman et  al .",
    "2005 and many references therein ) .",
    "the inner , equatorial ring is expanding at 10  km  s@xmath2 ; its true shape is a nearly circular ring of radius  0.67 ly , inclined at 43 degrees to our line of sight .",
    "analysis of the emission ",
    "line spectrum of the inner ring ( fransson et  al .",
    "2005 ) indicates that it is nitrogen - rich , with n/(c+o ) about 10 times greater than the solar ratio ( or perhaps somewhat smaller than this ; zhekov et  al .",
    "2006 ) . the enhanced n abundance is thought to be due to conversion of c and o to n by the cno cycle in sk  -69  202 before the ring material was expelled .",
    "the outer loops have physical radii 1.5  ly and lie on planes approximately parallel to the plane of the inner ring but displaced by about 1.3  ly on either side .",
    "the outer loops have radial velocities consistent with the interpretation that they were expelled at or near the time of the inner ring material .",
    "the presupernova evolution of sk  -69  202 and the origin of the triple ring system remain uncertain . according to the evolutionary models of massive stars the progenitors of most sne ii",
    "are expected to be rsgs .",
    "the prevailing opinion is that sn  1987a did become an rsg , during which time it may have expelled the material of the rings in the form of a slow wind , and then returned to the blue . within the current uncertainties of stellar evolution it is possible to make assumptions that cause models of single stars to return to the blue , but it is not clear that these assumptions are natural ( woosley et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "it is supposed that the fast wind of the second bsg phase then interacted with the slow wind of the rsg phase to produce the present ring system ( e.g. , lundqvist & fransson 1996 ; sugarman et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , to end up with a ring system rather than a more spherical shell , the rsg wind must have been for some reason equatorially enhanced , and if sk  -69  202 had been an rsg one might expect some evidence for circumstellar gas and dust , emission lines , and variability in the presupernova data obtained between 1971 and 1983 .",
    "opposed to the single ",
    "star scenario above is that sk  -69  202 may have been the product of the merger of an rsg and a less massive companion star ( hillebrandt & meyer 1989 ; podsiadlowski & ivanova 2003 ) .",
    "such a merger can result in a bsg and perhaps a complex circumstellar system .",
    "however , the scenario is complicated .",
    "morris & podsiadlowski ( 2006 ) find that the mass ejection would be primarily at mid ",
    "latitudes rather than in the equatorial plane .",
    "they suggest that the mid  latitude ejection provided the material of the outer rings , and that the equatorial ejection of the inner ring material occurred _",
    "after _ the merger in a rotation  enforced outflow during the contraction toward the blue .",
    "another possible difficulty with the merger model is that it requires fine tuning to get the merger to happen just 20,000 years before the supernova , which would make sn  1987a an uncommon event ( woosley et  al .",
    "2002 ) . also , if sk  -69  202 was a merger product , rapid rotation of a few hundred km s@xmath2 is expected .",
    "as mentioned above , the spectra of sk  -69  202 showed no evidence for rapid rotation .",
    "is it possible that sk  -69  202 never was an rsg ?",
    "pastorello et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) presented spectroscopic and photometric observations of the peculiar type  ii sn  1998a .",
    "they showed that in many respects the light curves and spectra resembled those of sn  1987a , indicating that the progenitor of sn  1998a also was a bsg . in spite of the strong observational selection against the discovery of subluminous events , pastorello et  al . cited the existence of several other sne  ii with ( fragmentary ) light curves possibly similar in shape to sn  1987a and sn  1998a , which suggests that explosions of bsgs are not too uncommon",
    "this would be inconsistent with explanations that require fine tuning .",
    "instead , there may be some regular channel for producing sn  1987a  like events . from stellar evolution calculations hflich et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) found that models having somewhat lower metallicity or higher main  sequence mass than sn  1987a explode as bsgs without becoming rsgs , but the quantitative results depend on various assumptions .",
    "a problem for this scenario for sn  1987a , though , is that if sk  -69  202 never was an rsg , then there may be no good explanation for the low  velocity circumstellar material , although mccray & lin ( 1994 ) suggested that the inner ring is the inner rim of a disk of gas left over from the formation of sk  -69  202 .",
    "it is interesting that sher  25 , an apparently normal b1.5  iab supergiant in or near the galactic open cluster ngc  3603 , has a system of rings reminiscent of sn  1987a ( brandner et  al .",
    "like other b  type supergiants , sher  25 has photospheric cno abundances that indicate strong processing via the cno cycle ( crowther et  al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the history of sk  -69  202 continues to be a mystery .",
    "future observations of the interaction between the high  velocity ejecta of sn  1987a and the circumstellar matter , especially in x  rays ( zhekov et  al .",
    "2006 ) , may provide vital clues to the past .",
