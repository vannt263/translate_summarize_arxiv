    "among the many contributions werner ebeling made to the interdisciplinary applications of statistical physics , his concept of _ active motion _ stands out as the most proliferate .",
    "more than 35 of his own publications deal , directly or indirecly , with such dynamic phenomena that rely on the influx of energy .",
    "a citation analysis by now mentions 415 citations , lead by a paper published in _",
    "biosystems _ in 1999 @xcite which also forms the basis of the current publication .",
    "but already an earlier publication in 1994 @xcite contained in a nutshell the main idea of negative friction to accelerate the motion of a brownian particle .",
    "the concept of active motion , as proposed by ebeling , relies on very few , but reasonable assumptions : particles , which we call _ agents _ in the following , have the ability ( i ) to take up energy from the environment , ( ii ) to store it in an internal energy depot , and ( iii ) to use this internal energy to accelerate their motion . without additional energy take - up , the agent s motion is described by a stochastic dynamics in terms of a langevin equation , which denotes the limit case of brownian motion . a brownian particle",
    "moves passively because the friction which would lead to rest , asymptotically , is compensated by a stochastic force .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the special form given by einstein tells us how the mean squared displacement of such a brownian particle is related to fundamental properties of the medium it is placed in , such as viscosity or temperature .",
    "this well known scenario is changed if such particles are turned into `` agents '' by getting additional internal degrees of freedom , such as the internal energy depot discussed in the following . then the passive and random motion can , under certain conditions , be turned into an _ active _ and _ directed _ motion , which is already found on the level of micro organisms and cells @xcite .",
    "the theory developed from the above assumptions makes a number of predictions about the active motion of agents with an internal energy depot which have , however , not been tested experimentally .",
    "so , it is worth to find out to what extent living organisms , such as cells or bacteria , can be described by `` active brownian particles '' .",
    "the current paper wants to contribute to this discussion .",
    "in addition to the theoretical framework already developed , it can build on a parallel strand of investigations about the motility of cells @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 , we recall the analytical framework of active brownian particles , by deriving the equation of motion in the presence of an internal energy depot",
    ". then , different assumptions for the conversion of internal into kinetic energy are developed , which lead to three hypotheses to be tested experimentally .",
    "sect 3 describes the experimental observations in detail .",
    "a comparison between theory and experiment is carried out in sect . 4 at the level of the speed distribution , which is derived from a fokker - planck equation and compared with empirical densities .",
    "details of the results are presented in the appendix .",
    "a conclusion summarizes our findings and points out the limitations of their interpretation .",
    "our approach to model the biological motion of bacteria is based on active brownian particles or _ brownian agents _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "each of these agents @xmath6 is described by three continuous variables : spatial position @xmath7 , velocity @xmath8 and internal energy depot @xmath9 .",
    "whereas the spatial position and the velocity of an agent describe its _ movement _ and can be observed by an external observer , the agent s energy depot , however , represents an _ internal _ variable that can only be deduced indirectly from the agent s motion .    for the internal energy depot we assume , in most general terms , the following balance equation : @xmath10 @xmath11 describes the `` influx '' of energy into the depot , for example through the take - up of nutrients , which therefore may depend on the agent s position and on time .",
    "the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of energy was modelled e.g. in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we assume both for simplicity and in accordance with the experiments described below that nutrients are abundant , hence the take - up of energy is homogeneous , i.e. constant in time and space , @xmath12 .",
    "but , dependent on the experimental condition , @xmath13 varies dependent on the concentration @xmath14 of nutrients , but not across agents .",
    "the `` outflux '' of energy from the depot @xmath15 depends on those activities of an agent which require additional energy .",
    "in @xcite we have modeled the case that agents produce chemical information used for communication , e.g. in chemotaxis . applying our model to the motion of bacteria",
    ", we simply assume that energy is spent on two `` activities '' : ( i ) metabolism , which is assumed to be proportional to the level of internal energy , with the metabolism rate @xmath16 being constant in time and equal across agents .",
    "alternatively , one could assume that metabolism further depends on the size of the bacteria .",
    "( ii ) active motion , i.e. internal energy is converted into kinetic energy for the bacteria to move at a velocity much higher than the thermal velocity of brownian motion . for this conversion",
    "we assume that it proportional to the internal energy and further depends monotonously , but nonlinearly on the _ speed _ @xmath17 of the agent .",
    "@xmath17 is a scalar quantity , describing how fast the agent is moving , regardless of direction .",
    "velocity @xmath18 , on the other hand , describes the direction as well as the speed at which the agent is moving .",
    "our assumption is that the conversion rate @xmath0 does not further depend on the position of the agent or on the direction of motion . @xmath19\\ ] ] this ansatz satisfies the idea that without internal energy @xmath20 no metabolism or active motion is possible .",
    "we note that previously the particular ansatz @xmath21 was discussed in detail @xcite , but not yet confirmed by experiments .",
    "therefore , in this paper we want to find out whether this or other possible assumptions are supported by experiments , so we leave @xmath0 unspecified for the moment . but",
    "it is important to note the proportion between the two different terms : bacteria spent the vast amount of their internal energy for metabolism , not for active motion .",
    "consequently the approximation @xmath22 , which was discussed in previous investigations , does not hold for bacteria .    assuming that the internal energy depot relaxes fast into a quasi - stationary equilibrium allows to approximate the internal energy depot as @xmath23 i.e.",
    ", the level of the internal energy depot follows instantaneously adjustments of the speed .",
    "the equation of motion for a brownian agent is given by a langevin equation for the velocity @xmath8 .",
    "however , because of the conversion of internal into kinetic energy with a rate @xmath0 , we need to consider an additional driving force the structure of which can be obtained from a total energy balance . in the absense of an external potential , the mechanical energy of the agent",
    "is given by the kinetic energy , @xmath24 , which can be changed by two different processes : ( i ) it decreases because of friction , with @xmath25 being the friction coefficient ( equal for all agents ) , and ( ii ) it increases because of conversion of internal energy into energy of motion .",
    "hence , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the total balance balance equation gives : @xmath28 deviding this equation by @xmath29 results in the deterministic equation of motion : @xmath30\\ ] ] based on this , we propose the langevin equation for the brownian agent by adding to the right - hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : det ] ) a stochastic force @xmath31 with the usual properties , namely that no drift is exerted on average , @xmath32 , and that no correlations exist in time or between agents , @xmath33 . for physical systems",
    "the strength of the stochastic force @xmath34 is defined by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem which itself builds on the equipartition law , but for microbiological objects such as cells and bacteria the situation has proven to be more intricate , as we will outline later .",
    "assuming a quasistationary internal energy depot , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : estat ] ) and defining @xmath35 , we arrive at the modified langevin equation for the brownian agent : @xmath36   +     \\sqrt{2s}\\ { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\xi$}}}_{i}(t)\\ ] ] where @xmath37 denotes gaussian white noise .",
    "( [ eqno3 ] ) shall be used as the starting point for the further discussion .",
    "we now specify the function @xmath0 for which we assume a nonlinear dependence on the speed in terms of the following power series : @xmath38 using different orders of this power series , we first evaluate the stationary velocity estimated from the deterministic part of eqn .",
    "( [ eqno3 ] ) ( omitting the index @xmath6 for the moment ) and then compare the outcome against data from experiments with bacteria .    neglecting the stochastic term of eqn .",
    "( [ eqno3 ] ) , we first notice that @xmath39 is always a solution . caused by friction , the motion of an agent shall come to rest  but in a stochastic system agents still passively move thanks to the impact of the random force @xmath40 .",
    "secondly , taking into account the influence of the internal energy depot , we notice the importance of the rate of metabolism , @xmath16 . for @xmath41",
    ", we always find for the nontrivial speed @xmath42 independent of further assumptions for @xmath0 .",
    "i.e. , dependent on the take - up of energy @xmath13 agents move with a constant speed . for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath45 , this nontrivial speed is corrected leading to @xmath46 that means dependent on the proportion of metabolism vs active motion , the stationary velocity can be consirably lowered . for further comparison it is convenient to rewrite eqn .",
    "( [ eq : d0 ] ) in a different way @xmath47 where the reduced parameter @xmath48 combines the relevant parameters of the model describing take - up energy and active motion @xmath49 and external and internal dissipation @xmath50 .    considering the next higher order of the polynom , @xmath51 for @xmath52 ,",
    "the stationary speed follows from the quadratic equation : @xmath53 one can verify that these solutions are not consistent with other physical considerations , in particular the speed @xmath54 , for large @xmath16 , is biased toward negative values .",
    "testing another first order assumption , @xmath55 , does not improve the situation , because @xmath56 is additive with @xmath16 and thus just rescales the metabolism rate .",
    "consequently , we have to restrict ourselves to the case @xmath57 , i.e. we arrive at @xmath21 which is the known set model @xcite with the stationary solution for the speed @xmath17 : @xmath58 different from the previous cases , for @xmath57 we find a bifurcation dependent on the control parameter @xmath59 . for @xmath60",
    ", @xmath61 is the only real stationary solution , whereas for @xmath62 a nontrivial solution for the speed exist .",
    "the possible consequences are already discussed in the literature . in @xcite the supercritical case , @xmath62 was investigated , while in @xcite the subcritical case @xmath60 was considered . because metabolism consumes the lion share of the internal energy provided , one would assume that @xmath63 is the most realistic case for the motion of bacterial cells  which remains to be tested .",
    "for the stochastic motion , eqn .",
    "( [ eqno3 ] ) , in the supercritical case the contribution of the stochastic term is small compared to the kinetic energy provided by the energy depot .",
    "hence , the agent should move forward with a non - trivial velocity ( i.e. much above the thermal fluctuations ) , which has a rather constant speed , but can change its direction occasionally . in the subcritical case ,",
    "on the other hand , the stochastic fluctuations dominate the motion , but the energy depot still contributes , this way resulting in the first order approximation of the stationary velocity ( in one dimension ) : @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the authors of @xcite put forward a nice argument that in the high dissipation regime  or in environments with low nutrition concentration  a strong coupling between the two energy sources ( depot and noise ) appears that should help micro organisms to search more efficiently for a more favorable environment .",
    "we are not going to repeat these theoretical discussions .",
    "instead , we ask a different question not investigated so far : which of the above cases is consistent with _",
    "experimental findings _ ?",
    "as outlined above , the set model with its two regimes , ( i ) @xmath60 , i.e. subcritical energy supply , and ( ii ) @xmath62 , i.e. supercritical energy supply , is the most promising ansatz to be tested for @xmath0 . to compare this with a more general setting , instead of integers",
    "@xmath65 we may also consider fractional numbers @xmath66 with @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 , which results in the following equation for the stationary solutions : @xmath69 reasonable values of @xmath4 should be in the interval between 1 and 2  for which we expect two nontrivial solutions for the stationary velocity , but no bifurcation with respect to the parameter @xmath59 . in conclusion ,",
    "our theoretical investigations provide us with three different hypotheses for the active motion of biological agents :    1 .",
    "@xmath21 with subcritical take - up of energy , i.e. @xmath70 2 .",
    "@xmath21 with supercritical take - up of energy , i.e. @xmath62 3 .",
    "@xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath62",
    "in order to test which of the above outlined hypotheses regarding active biological motion is compatible with real biological motion of bacteria , we proceed as follows : bacterial cells are placed in a shallow medium that can be approximated as a two - dimensional system . keeping all other conditions constant , we vary the nutrition concentration in that medium so that three different nutrition levels are maintained : low , medium , and high .",
    "we then measure the velocity distribution of the bacteria ( as described below ) in response to these nutrition levels .",
    "eventually , we do a maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters describing the velocity distributions and compare these with the hypotheses made .",
    "ideally , we would expect that the experimental velocity distributions could be better fitted by one of the hypotheses , while the others could be rejected .",
    "when it comes to the specific setup of the experiments , we soon realize that the devil is in the details . in order to be conform with our hypotheses",
    ", we would need to test bacteria that move like brownian particles in the limit of low nutrition , while performing a rather directed motion for high nutrition concentration , with arbitrary changes in the direction . instead",
    ", most bacteria , _ escherichia coli _ being a prominent example , move quite differently , i.e. their movement switches between tumbling and nontumbling phases @xcite . tumbles denote temporary erratic movements , whereas during the nontumbling phases , called runs , bacteria execute a highly directed , ballistic - like motion .",
    "both of these phases describe a different form of active motion , but do not differ in the mechanism or level of energy supply . precisely , the flagellar propellers responsible for the forward motion @xcite rotate with the same efficiency during the tumbling and non - tumbling phases @xcite .    in order to avoid an abritary averaging over these different forms of active motion , we have chosen to study bacteria that do not tumble at all , specifically the non - tumbling strain m935 of _ salmonella typhimurium _ @xcite .",
    "this type of bacterial cells has another advantage in that it does not perform chemotaxis , i.e. it does not follow chemical gradients or gradients in the nutrient concentration , which would bias the motility towards directed motion . but mutant strain is capable to take up the nutrients at the same rate as normal _ s. typhimurium_.    for the medium , we have realized an almost two - dimensional setup , keeping in mind that three - dimensional motion results in a projection error of the trajectories .",
    "further , we need to ensure that both the temperature @xmath73 and the viscosity @xmath74 of the medium is kept constant over time and across setups with different nutrient concentrations .",
    "these were prepared as follows :    medium 0 : :    used as a reference case where no additional nutrients are available    for the bacteria .",
    "it consists of a _ phosphate - buffered saline working    solution _ ( * pbs * ) , with 5 protein .",
    "medium 2 : :    a nutritionally rich medium which contains of _ lysogeny broth _",
    "( * lb * ) ,    a substance also primarily used for the growth of bacteria .",
    "medium 1 : :    a medium with an intermediate concentration of nutrients .",
    "it contains    an mixture of medium 0 and 2 , equally .",
    "we assume that the nutrients are equally dissolved in the whole medium and that nutrient concentration differences can be neglected .",
    "further , the depletion of nutrients due to consumption of the bacterial cells can be neglected .",
    "hence , we assume that the take - up of energy per time unit , @xmath13 is constant and equal for all bacterial cells , but may change dependent on the nutient concentration , i.e. @xmath13 needs to be determined for each of the three different settings as described below .      in order to observe trajectories , bacteria of the same _ salmonella _",
    "strain were grown ( details see appendix a ) and were put into the three different media . for each medium , we recorded two movies at different times : ( i ) after the bacteria were put into the different media ( initial condition ) , and ( ii ) after about one hour , i.e. after a sufficiently long time of relaxation , which ensures a stationary velocity distribution .",
    "we had to assume that the cells would adapt rather slowly to the new environment .",
    "appendix b presents the details of how the trajectories were recorded .    as the trajectories of fig .",

    "their trajectories are mostly slightly curved .",
    "initially , at least two trajectories are very strongly curved where bacteria seem to swim in narrow circles .",
    "the videos make clear that bacteria swim in an isotropic manner and with a mean velocity .",
    "it is remarkable that the bacteria maintain their quasi - ballistic movement even after more than one hour , despite not being able to take up energy from the medium .",
    "given the trajectories measured at a time resolution of 0.11 sec , we are able to calculate the velocity vector in the two - dimensional space as @xmath75 where @xmath14 denotes the bacterial cell and @xmath76 refers to the time step .",
    "the velocity distributions are shown in fig .",

    "each of the samples contains about 1.500 data points .    in all cases ,",
    "we observe the formation of rings of different radii , indicating that bacteria swim at comparable velocities in the time intervals of observation and that their motion is isotropic , i.e. that they do not have a preferrred direction of motion .",
    "most interesting , compared to the initial distribution the rings either contract ( medium 0 ) or expand ( medium 1 , 2 ) in diameter , which means that the bacteria have adjusted their individual velocities according to the nutrient concentration available .",
    "this will be systematically investigated in the next section .",
    "the available data do not allow us to predict if the rings completely contract ( medium 0 ) or further expand ( medium 1,2 ) their extension .",

    "such a comparison can not be made on the level of individual trajectories , but only on the level of the ensemble average .",

    "the amount of data measured does not allow us to reasonably reconstruct the two - dimensional velocity distribution by means of density approximations .",
    "therefore , in the following , we restrict ourselves to the distribution of the speed which contains sufficient information to test our hypotheses given . to find the speed distribution @xmath86 in two dimensions we integrate over a disk @xmath87 : @xmath88 and find @xmath89 when comparing this equation with eqn .",

    "we further find that the speed autocorrelation function @xmath119 returns comparable values for all three media ( @xmath128 ) which are much larger than for granulocytes , because we have much smaller and more motile cells .",
    "the estimated standard deviations @xmath129 range between @xmath130 m/s ( medium 0 ) and @xmath131 m/s ( medium 2 ) and are quite similar for all media , because the temperature and the viscosity of the media are kept as constant as possible .    the actual width of the speed distribution , however",
    ", does not just depend on @xmath105 but also on the parameters of the internal energy depot and is therefore larger than @xmath132 . in order to calculate the parameter values that maximize the likelihood , we restrict ourselves to reduced parameters . keeping in mind that @xmath99 is given by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : gvconstant ] ) and the control parameter is defined as @xmath133 , we can rewrite the leading terms in eqn .",
    "( [ pa0 ] ) as : @xmath134 which reduces the number of parameters to be determined to @xmath135 and @xmath59 , while @xmath136 is given by the experiments .",
    "@xmath4 on the other hand is either set to 2 , in case of the set model , or used as a free parameter .",
    "given the observations @xmath137 the mle then determines for which values @xmath138 of these parameters the likelihood function @xmath139 is maximised , i.e. what are the most likely model parameters that fit the experimental data best , conditional on the model used .    in order to fully appreciate the mle",
    ", we have to notice that no further `` logical '' assumption are made , i.e. , each for experimental distribution the mle returns that set of parameter values that fits _ this _ particular distribution best .",
    "precisely , we receive most likely a different set of values for each of the given distributions . to put it the other way round , from all the observed distributions",
    "we can obtain a range of parameter values that is compatible with the experimental findings , rather than a precise value that is met by all observations .    with this in mind",
    ", we can interpret table [ expparm2 ] as follows : for both hypotheses , the set model with @xmath2 and the general model with @xmath122 , we find from the observations a `` reasonable '' ( but different ) set of parameters that supports these hypotheses .",
    "this is also confirmed by the fits shows in figure [ fits ] .",
    "i.e. , we can not reject one of these hypotheses as they both match the experimental findings .",
    "however , we did not observe a subciritical take - up of energy for the set model , as we did not find values @xmath70 for the given observations .",
    "the latter conclusion needs a further explanation : in medium 0 , we made no nutrients available , so @xmath13 and @xmath59 should both be zero .",
    "however , the bacteria were grown in a medium that contained nutrients and thus , at time @xmath77 , started their motion with a filled energy depot @xmath140 , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : estat ] ) , that changes over time only rather slowly as @xmath54 is adjusted . hence ,",
    "the value @xmath59 for medium 0 at time @xmath78 reflects the value of the internal energy depot at time @xmath78 . as the observations in figures [ aveldis ] , [ fits ] and table [ tab : speed ] show , even after a long time the bacteria still have energy enough to move with a non - trivial speed @xmath54 despite the fact that no nutrients are provided .",
    "but there is a clear trend toward slowing down as the values indicate .",
    "as second interesting observation regards the decrease of the @xmath141 values with increasing nutrient concentration ( comparing medium 1 and 2 ) , for both the set and the @xmath4 model .",
    "the ratio @xmath142 reflects the proportion of energy bacteria spend on the two different processes , active motion and metabolism . if more energy becomes available ( from medium 1 to 2 )",
    ", this does not necessarily lead to a speed - up  the speed was kept almost constant , but the additional energy is likely spent on metabolism ( and growth ) .",
    "hence @xmath143 _ decreases _ from 1.50 to 0.62 for the set model , and from 0.74 to 0.23 for the @xmath4 model , while the take - up of energy @xmath144 has _ increased _ from 2500 to 4140 for the set model , and from 5230 to 6800 for the @xmath4 model .",
    "so , in conclusion , our model suggests that bacteria indeed take up more energy from the environment if more nutrients are provided , but the ratio spent on active motion is decreased , while the ratio spent on metabolism is increased .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold : ( i ) we investigate to what extent a theoretical model of active motion , namely that of `` active brownian particles '' , is compatible with experimental findings from bacterial cell motility , ( ii ) we test the impact of available energy in the environment , varied by the nutrient concentration in the medium , on the speed distribution of bacterial cells",
    ".    for the discussion one has to keep in mind that our results have been obtained for a particular strain of _ salmonella typhimurium _ ( see sect . 3.1 . and appendix a ) and can not easily generalized to other bacterial cells .",
    "this is because of the rather complex cellular motion of bacteria which , in many cases , is comprised of tumbling and nontumbling phases ( see sect .",
    "hence , for the motion of other types of bacteria we refer to the extensive literature @xcite .    comparing the experiments with moving _",
    "s. typhimurium _ and the theoretical model , we demonstrated that the measured speed distribution can indeed be matched by the analytical prediction .",
    "this holds for both tested hypothesis , ( a ) the set model with @xmath2 and ( b ) the @xmath4 model , which allows an adjustment of the exponent , @xmath122 .",
    "we further confirmed that , under the give experimental conditions , bacteria move in the supercritical regime , @xmath62 .",
    "however , we were not able to observe as subcritical behavior with @xmath70 as predicted for the set model @xcite .",
    "this can be probably explained by the fact that even at the end of our experiments bacterial cells had still enough internal energy available from their growing period , to move with a nontrivial speed .",
    "but we could notice a considerable slowing down of 25with no additional nutrients .",
    "regarding the impact of available nutrients , we found that the speed of bacteria did not increase in proportion to it .",
    "instead , we observed a more or less constant speed , even if the nutrient concentration was doubled . from calculating the model parameters for both cases , we conjecture that indeed more energy was taken up by the cells , but this was used for other internal processes such as metabolism and growth .    in conclusion , the experiments carried out with bacterial cells moving in media of three different nutrient concentrations could confirm the theoretical predictions and thus indirectly also support the assumptions made for our model of active brownian particles .",
    "however , particular details of the choice of parameters can not be fully resolved by our experiments  which is not very surprising .",
    "this regards for example the `` correct '' value of the exponent @xmath4 for the speed , @xmath145 .",
    "our findings support values between 1.67 and 2.0 if a take - up of energy from the medium was possible .",
    "the differences between the two assumptions are not so much in the values of @xmath4 but in the theoretical consequences . in the case of the set model",
    ", there is a clear bifurcation which allows to distinguish between subcritical ( brownian motion like ) behavior , and supercritical behavior characterized by a directed motion",
    ". it would still be interesting to find microorganisms for which these regimes could be determined .",
    "our experiments had to restrict to the conditions explained above and therefore do not support this distinction .",
    "the chemotaxis - deficient salmonella strain m935 ( sl1344 ; chey::tn10 , @xcite ) was grown under mild aeration for 12 h/37@xmath146c in lb medium containing 0.3 m nacl .",
    "the culture was diluted 1:20 into fresh medium and grown for another 4h / 37@xmath147c .",
    "bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation ( 8500 rpm , 5 min , 4@xmath147c ) and resuspended in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) .",

    "probe b was diluted 1:50 in a 1:1 mixture of pbs/5 ( final bsa concentration : 2.5    all solutions for dilution of probes a and b were prewarmed to 37@xmath147c .",
