    "<S> we have analyzed maxwell - chern - simons - higgs bps vortices in a lorentz - violating cpt - odd context . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz violation induces profiles with a conical behavior at the origin . for some combination of the coefficients for lorentz violation there </S>",
    "<S> always exists a sufficiently large winding number for which the magnetic field flips its sign .    </S>",
    "<S> lorentz - violating ( lv ) theories have caught much attention since the proposal of the standard - model extension ( sme ) @xcite , whose properties have been intensively scrutinized in many areas of contemporary physics . </S>",
    "<S> the study of topological defects in lv scenarios was conducted initially for kinks @xcite , monopoles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , the formation of topological defects ( monopoles ) was analyzed in a broader framework of field theories endowed with tensor fields that spontaneously break lorentz symmetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the existence of bps vortex of type abrikosov - nielsen - olesen has been shown in the presence of cpt - even lv terms of the sme @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this contribution is to study chern - simons - like bps vortices in an lv framework attained via the dimensional reduction of the maxwell - carroll - field - jackiw - higgs model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such dimensional reduction provides a maxwell - chern - simons - higgs ( mcsh ) model modified by lv terms , @xmath0 where the lv parameter @xmath1 plays the role of a chern - simons coupling , and @xmath2 is the ( 1 + 2)-dimensional carroll - field - jackiw ( cfj ) background . </S>",
    "<S> the potential @xmath3 provides the bps vortices . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding gauss law is @xmath4    to explicitly attain the vortex solutions , we use the ansatz @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 satisfy the following boundary conditions : @xmath9where @xmath10 is the winding number of the vortex configuration , @xmath11 is the angular component of @xmath12 whereas the constant @xmath13 depends on the boundary conditions and it is numerically determined . in this ansatz the magnetic field is given by @xmath14 .  </S>",
    "<S> then , the stationary energy density associated with the model ( [ l2 ] ) is written as @xmath15 ^{2}+v^{2}\\left ( g^{\\prime } </S>",
    "<S> \\mp \\frac{ag}{r}\\right ) ^{2}\\pm ev^{2}b+\\partial _ { a}\\mathcal{j}_{a } ,   \\label{e_den}\\]]where the condition @xmath16 was adopted to insure positiveness of the energy density . </S>",
    "<S> the energy is minimized by requiring @xmath17which are the bps equations , where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to @xmath18 @xmath19 . these and the gauss law now written as @xmath20describe topological vortices in this lv mcsh model . for @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> one recovers the mcsh system . under bps equations and boundary conditions ( [ bc1])-([bc2 ] ) , the eq . ( [ e_den ] ) </S>",
    "<S> provides the bps energy @xmath22 , which is proportional to the quantized magnetic flux , @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ bps ] depicts the profiles of the magnetic field obtained by numerical integration of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bps_cart2])-([gauss_2 ] ) for @xmath24 , and some values of @xmath25 and @xmath10 . for large values of radial coordinate </S>",
    "<S> , the profiles behave in a similar way to the mcsh ones but with mass scales @xmath26 satisfying @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the role played by the lv parameter becomes more pronounced at the origin , where it generates a conical structure absent in the mcsh profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical analysis shows that for @xmath28 ( analogous results are obtained for @xmath29 ) , a fixed @xmath1 , and @xmath30 there are always two well defined regions with positive magnetic flux , occurring no magnetic field reversion . on the other hand , for fixed </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 , and @xmath31 there always exists a sufficiently large winding number @xmath32  such that for all @xmath33 the magnetic field reverses its sign . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , there are always two well defined regions with opposite magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> the flipping of the magnetic flux represents another remarkable feature induced by lorentz violation . </S>"
