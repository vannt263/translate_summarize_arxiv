    "again , the desired symmetry of the output state is obtained by imposing it on the virtual level and ensuring that the gaussian map keeps it .",
    "we realize that the virtual modes already have the desired symmetry , since their covariance matrix @xmath300 after regrouping the virtual indices can be written directly in quaternionic representation as @xmath301 because the representation of a quaternion @xmath302 by complex matrices is @xmath303 .",
    "the gaussian map keeps the symmetry by requiring that @xmath35 can also be represented by quaternions , that is @xmath304 ( note that @xmath20 has to be even ) .",
    "then , the output covariance matrix is simply @xmath305 where @xmath306 and @xmath307 with equality for pure states .",
    "the quaternionic representation has been used in the numerical calculations of this work in order to exploit the symmetries of the hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "given a mixed or pure gfpeps ( e.g. , obtained after performing a minimization of the free energy ) , its hall conductivity can be calculated by setting @xmath308 to extract @xmath288 and @xmath309 .",

    "<S> we have also investigated the power of the gfpeps to describe topological insulators at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this was done by minimizing the free energy functional @xmath158 ( @xmath159 : von neumann entropy ) of the above model at @xmath152 , with a gfpeps with @xmath160 , i.e. , one bond majorana fermion per physical fermion , cf . </S>",

    "<S> [ numerics]b , c : for @xmath161 , the entropy of the gfpeps does indeed converge to zero , that is , it approaches a pure state ; its analytical form is just the one given in eq .  , with @xmath162 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that by minimizing the free energy as a function of @xmath163 one can converge to pure states which are topological even for small @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , pure gfpeps are well suited to describe topological insulators in numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we have substantiated this claim further by minimizing the free energy @xmath164 for @xmath71 as a function of @xmath165 for @xmath151 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ numerics]d . </S>",
    "<S> the entropies of the optimal gfpeps were of the order of @xmath166 which is why their chern numbers coincide with their hall conductivities , which jump from @xmath167 to @xmath168 at @xmath169 . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that quantum phase transitions can be detected by approximating the ground state energy with gfpeps .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions.__in this letter , we have studied whether projected entangled pair states can be used to describe chiral topological states . </S>",
    "<S> we have answered this question in the affirmative , by providing a class of gaussian fermionic peps ( gfpeps ) describing systems with a non - zero chern number ; these states can be ground states of either gapless strictly local hamiltonians or gapped hamiltonians with algebraically decaying hoppings and/or pairings . </S>",
    "<S> we have further shown that the gaplessness of the strictly local parent hamiltonian is a necessary condition to have topological order . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have numerically studied the ability of gfpeps to approximate chiral free fermion systems , and found that gfpeps can efficiently approximate both ground and thermal states of chiral hamiltonians with a small bond dimension , making them a well - suited tool for the numerical study of chiral fermionic systems .    while we restricted our studies to gaussian peps </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that one can also describe interacting chiral systems with fermionic peps by twisting the gaussian peps projector @xmath34 with a non - gaussian map . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore believe that fermionic peps will also be suitable as a numerical tool to study fractional quantum hall systems .    </S>",
