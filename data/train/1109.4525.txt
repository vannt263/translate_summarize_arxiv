    "stellar evolution theory predicts that both slow expansions and contractions of stars within the pulsation instability strip are expected , that result in increasing and decreasing periods , respectively . since the pioneering work of @xcite on the period changes of the rr lyrae stars in @xmath4 centauri ,",
    "numerous studies have been carried out with a view to detect period changes connected with stellar evolution .",
    "the best targets for such investigations are globular clusters ( gc ) , as most of them have a large rr lyrae population , and their observations have extended hitherto over 50100 years .",
    "the investigations , however , have revealed that , contrary to all expectations , both fast period increase and decrease , repeated irregular and/or abrupt changes may also characterize the period changes .",
    "this kind of period - change behaviour could not at all be reconciled with evolutionary models . moreover ,",
    "the observations have shown peculiar cases , too .",
    "some stars showed regular or quasi - regular period - change behaviour for more than half a century , then suddenly , continuous or abrupt irregular changes in their period have taken place .",
    "one may ponder how long a time base would be enough to distinguish between evolutionary period changes and period changes caused by other effects .",
    "several ideas have been propounded to interpret the non - evolutionary period changes , but none of them have been proven to be fully satisfactory yet .",
    "although the observed large , non - evolutionary period changes may frustrate the observer , there is a consent among researchers concerned that the mean value of the period - change rates of a large sample of rr lyrae stars of a globular cluster reflects the trend of evolution consistently with the model calculation results of @xcite .",
    "one of the most thoroughly investigated globular cluster , as for the variable stars , is messier 3 ( as a recent study of the variables see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it contains one of the largest rr lyrae populations .",
    "the latest investigation of the period - change behaviour of the rr lyrae stars in m3 was made by @xcite .",
    "this period - change study utilized the @xmath3 data published by @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) in combination with ccd observations obtained between 1990 and 1997 .",
    "the lack of published observational data from between 1962 to 1990 made the results , however , somewhat dubious for many of the variables .",
    "since the archival , previously unpublished konkoly photographic observations obtained in the years between 1964 and 1989 fill this gap , and the new ccd photometry from 2009 extends the baseline of the observations by a decade over a century , a fresh hope arises to get a better insight into the period - change behaviour of cluster variables .",
    "this provides the motivation for the present study .    [ cols=\">,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    ") versus fourier phase difference ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 versus period plots of 42 , non - blazhko , ooi type rrab stars .",
    "stars with increasing and decreasing periods are marked by upward and downward triangles , respectively .",
    "the plus marks and asterisks denote variables with stable periods and irregular period changes , respectively .",
    "the second - order polynomial fits of the data are also shown in the figures .",
    "there is a slight tendency that the distributions of stars with increasing and decreasing periods are systematically different . in all similar planes , period increasing and decreasing variables tend to cluster below and above the fitted curves , respectively .",
    "monte carlo simulations confirm that this effect is statistically significant . for a colour version of the figure see the online edition of the paper.,width=7 ]",
    "the ooi sequence of m3 is defined in our sample by 42 variables , which all have good - quality ccd light curves with accurate fourier parameters .",
    "there are 16 and 15 stars with increasing and decreasing pulsation periods in this sample , respectively .",
    "the distributions of these stars do not show any systematic differences either on the @xmath7 plane or on any of the @xmath8fourier amplitude ( @xmath9 ) plots .",
    "consequently , they seem to belong to a very homogeneous population .",
    "these data enable us to examine whether the period - change behaviour has any effect on the light - curve shapes of the variables .",
    "a visual inspection of the locations of variables with increasing and decreasing periods on the plots of the possible combinations of the fourier parameters suggests that there may be some slight systematic difference between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 relations of variables of increasing and decreasing periods as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pl ] .",
    "a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation confirms the reality of the differences undoubtedly .",
    "the mean distance of the 16 period - increasing and 15 period - decreasing variables from a second - order fit of the total sample of 42 ooi stars are calculated in the different @xmath12 , and @xmath11 planes . in all the @xmath12 planes , period increasing variables tend to have 0.0020.014 mag lower amplitudes on the averages at a given phase - difference value than period decreasing variables have , while their phase differences tend to be smaller by 0.030.07 rad at a given period than the phase differences of variables with decreasing periods .",
    "although the differences between the mean distances of the two groups from the common fits are smaller than @xmath13 in each case , mc simulations show that it has only 0.1% probability that in each @xmath12 , and @xmath11 plane a mean offset between the two groups similar to or larger than what is observed occurs by chance .",
    "the mean @xmath14 brightness of the period - decreasing sample is 0.01 mag brighter that the mean brightness of the period - increasing one .",
    "therefore , the question arises whether the observed differences between the light - curve shapes are the consequence of a slight difference in the luminosities of the two samples . in order to test this possibility ,",
    "a mc analysis has also been carried out excluding the brightest ( v11 ) and the faintest stars ( v76 ) from the period decreasing and increasing samples , respectively .",
    "the difference between the mean @xmath14 brightnesses of the two samples has been reduced to 0.004 mag in this case .",
    "it has , however , marginal effect on the results .",
    "the observed differences between the fourier parameters of the remaining 15 and 14 stars are found to occur by chance in 0.2% of the mc simulations .",
    "the offsets between the fourier parameters of the period increasing and decreasing samples have not changed significantly by the omission of these two stars .",
    "the differences between the mean distances of the two samples from the common fits in the different fourier amplitude ",
    "phase difference combinations decreased on the average by @xmath15 per cent , but they increased by 7 per cent for the period  phase difference combinations .    a similar test was performed by excluding the shortest- and the longest - period stars with increasing and decreasing periods , respectively .",
    "no significant differences of the results has been found in this case either .",
    "the period - change behaviour of 134 rr lyrae stars in m3 is investigated using observations covering a time base longer than a century .",
    "the statistics of the period - change rates yield small positive mean and most - probable period - change rates for regular subsamples : variables showing strictly linear period changes ( 54 stars ) ; variables with regular and quasi - regular period - change properties , omitting blazhko stars and the most extreme period - decrease rate of v42 ( 60 stars ) .",
    "the @xmath16 mean period - increase rates derived for these subsamples agree well with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the model simulations of the period - change distributions of rr lyrae stars in gcs rely on the assumption that the observed period change of each variable reflects the actual evolutionary state of the star . in reality",
    ", however , this is not always true .    in m3",
    ", variables showing small period - decrease rates at mean - brightness values close to or slightly above the zahb magnitude , and the overluminous , long - period variables with period - increase rates of @xmath17 on the ooii sequence reflect evolutionary period changes very likely .",
    "nevertheless , when deriving any statistical value from the observed period - change rates , a number of variables are included , which do not fit in any phase of the hb evolution according to their period - change rate and brightness .",
    "as these variables typically have large period - change rates , they dominate the results of the statistics .",
    "therefore , a direct comparison of the statistical results and model predictions is somewhat dubious .",
    "the mean @xmath14 magnitudes of m3 variables belonging to the ooii sequence in the @xmath7 plane are 0.100.15 mag brighter than the mean magnitudes of the ooi variables .",
    "the brighter luminosity of variables near or on the ooii sequence supports the more evolved state of these stars .",
    "the period changes of many variables on the ooi and ooii sequences are , however , in conflict with theoretical expectations ; either the observed period changes do not reflect the evolutionary state of the star , or theory does not interpret the hb evolution accurately enough .",
    "the large number of variables displaying irregular period change and/or the blazhko effect seems to favour the former possibility .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these stars are even more numerous in m3 than in m5 @xcite . in m3 ,",
    "42 stars have irregular period changes and 52 stars show the blazhko effect among the 108 rrab variables studied .",
    "the occurrence of the blazhko effect and irregular period changes are strongly correlated both in m3 and m5 ; most of the blazhko stars have irregular period changes and variables with unstable pulsation period often display light - curve variability .",
    "although there is no satisfactory explanation either for the irregular period changes or the blazhko effect , the evolutionary period changes of variables showing these irregularities are presumably masked by other effects .    we have also shown that , in some cases , the light - curve modulation appears only temporarily , and the irregularity of the period variations are revealed only after a very long time interval ( more than 90 years ) of regular or quasi - regular period - change behaviour .",
    "therefore , it can be supposed that there is still an unidentified sample of blazhko stars and/or variables of irregular period changes among variables showing regular behaviour based on the available observations . some of the observed regular or quasi - regular period - change rates that do not fit the supposed evolutionary status can probably be explained by the temporal regularity of the light curve and/or the period change behaviour of these stars .",
    "one of the most important results of the present study is the detection of small , systematic differences between the light - curve parameters of period - increasing and period - decreasing variables .",
    "the ooi sequence of m3 is well populated and it supplies a homogeneous sample of variables with accurate light - curve parameters to perform a thorough investigation . at a given period and amplitude ,",
    "the epoch - independent phase differences of the light curves of period - increasing stars tend to be slightly smaller than the @xmath18 values of period - decreasing stars are .",
    "very probably , the period changes of many of the variables included in this comparison reflect other than evolutionary effects .",
    "consequently , the slight differences between their light curves are not caused by the different evolutionary stages in the two samples .",
    "we have already shown for some field blazhko stars that rapid period changes are accompanied by changes of the modulation properties and the shape ( amplitude ) of the mean pulsation light curve @xcite .",
    "further detailed investigations of the connections between period changes and variations / differences in the light curves of rrab stars may help to answer the question , what kind of structural changes / differences are responsible for the period - change behaviour of rrab stars .",
    "we thank the referee , christine clement , for the thorough reading of the manuscript , and for her comments .",
    "we also thank c. pilachowski for kindly providing us the information on the kitt peak observations .",
