    "<S> since then , the interest for geometric phases was renewed by potential applications to quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental demonstration of a conditional phase gate was provided both in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite and trapped ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> optical geometric phases have already been discussed both for polarization @xcite and vortex mode transformations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of entanglement in the phase evolution of qubits was investigated in refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , p. milman and r. mosseri @xcite investigated the geometric phase and the topological structure associated with cyclic evolutions of arbitrary two - qubit _ pure _ states . </S>",
    "<S> this structure has been experimentally evidenced in the context of spin - orbit mode transformations of a laser beam @xcite and in nmr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the topological nature of the phase acquired by maximally entangled states is well settled , the distinction between geometrical and topological phases has not been established clearly for partially entangled states . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we present a group theoretical approach which allows for a clear distinction between the two aspects . as a bonus , </S>",
    "<S> this approach is easily extended to higher dimensions , bringing an interesting prediction of a fractional topological phase .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath0 be the most general two - qudit pure state . </S>",
    "<S> we shall represent this state by the @xmath1 matrix @xmath2 whose elements are the coefficients @xmath3 . with this notation </S>",
    "<S> the norm of the state vector becomes @xmath4 and the scalar product between two states is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the @xmath1 matrix containing the coefficients of state @xmath7 in the chosen basis . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the phase evolution of the state @xmath8 under local unitary operations . </S>",
    "<S> so let us take two unitary matrices @xmath9 and @xmath10 belonging to @xmath11 and representing the operations performed in each subsystem separately . under these unitary operations </S>",
    "<S> the state matrix will evolve as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> one can identify the following invariants under local unitary evolutions : @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the reduced density matrix with respect to qudit @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the invariants are @xmath19-independent . </S>",
    "<S> the first one ( @xmath22 ) is simply the norm of the state vector . </S>",
    "<S> one can readily relate the second invariant to the _ i - concurrence _ of a two - qudit pure quantum state @xcite @xmath23)}$ ] , so that its invariance expresses the well known fact that entanglement is not affected by local unitary operations . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath24 invariant can be rewritten in terms of the former and @xmath25|$ ] . in particular , for qubits we have @xmath26 .    in the case of a cyclic evolution , @xmath27 . by taking the determinant of both sides </S>",
    "<S> we get : @xmath28 as long as @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the possible acquired phases due to the @xmath30 part of a cyclic evolution are @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . for qubits ( @xmath33 ) </S>",
    "<S> one recovers the well known result @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath35 one obtains fractional phase values in steps of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> now , we are interested in discussing in what sense this fractional phase can be considered as topological . for this aim </S>",
    "<S> , we will analyze the topology of the space of two - qudit states and how the total phase is built . in this regard </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to underline that according to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the geometric phase acquired by a time evolving quantum state @xmath37 is always defined as @xmath38 that corresponds to the total phase minus the dynamical phase . therefore , a topological phase , that is , an object that only depends on a given class of paths , can only find room as a part of the geometric phase , an object that is invariant under reparametrizations and gauge transformations . </S>",
    "<S> gauge invariance corresponds to the fact that the phase factors @xmath39 do not contribute to @xmath40 , which is completely determined by @xmath41 , the sector where the fractional values occur .    in order to characterize the space of states </S>",
    "<S> , we note that any invertible matrix admits a polar decomposition @xmath42 , where @xmath43{{\\cal d}}\\,e^m$ ] is a positive definite hermitian matrix , @xmath44 is a traceless hermitian matrix , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath47=e^{tr[m]}=1 $ ] , one easily finds @xmath48 . we can identify the time evolution as occurring in different sectors @xmath49{{\\cal d}}\\,e^{i\\phi(t)}\\,e^{m(t)}\\,\\bar{s}(t)\\ ; , \\label{polarevolution}\\ ] ] where we have denoted , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we identify the evolution in three sectors of the matrix structure : an explicit phase evolution @xmath53 , an evolution closed in the space of traceless hermitian matrices @xmath54 , and the evolution @xmath55 closed in @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we are able to discuss the topological aspects of the entangled state evolution in terms of these sectors . </S>",
    "<S> the space of positive definite hermitian matrices @xmath56 has trivial topology . </S>",
    "<S> this is a noncompact manifold isomorphous to @xmath57 , as it can be parametrized in the form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are real numbers and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is a basis in the space of hermitian traceless matrices . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath62 s are the generators of @xmath30 , so that @xmath63 , with @xmath64 real . </S>",
    "<S> they can be normalized in the form @xmath65 and obey the lie algebra @xmath66=if^{abc}t^c$ ] , where @xmath67 are the structure constants of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the first homotopy group of @xmath30 is also trivial , however , the physical equivalence of @xmath68 matrices differing by a global phase corresponds to considering the identification in @xmath30 , @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be naturally implemented by associating the @xmath30 sector of the matrix @xmath68 with a corresponding sector for the quantum states , represented by transformations @xmath70 in the adjoint representation @xmath71 , @xmath72 . in this manner , </S>",
    "<S> the matrices @xmath73 are mapped to the same point @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , a part of the evolution can be parametrized as @xmath74 , or equivalently , in terms of a time dependent frame @xmath75 . </S>",
