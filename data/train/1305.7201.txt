    "in the last ten years there has been an intense effort to discover new materials that display strong magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "such materials could enable novel devices in which an electric - field control magnetism.@xcite in this pursuit first - principles computational methods have played a key role by successfully predicting new material realizations  @xcite even when the underlying microscopic mechanisms have not always been clear.@xcite elucidating these mechanisms is important for both fundamental understanding and also for guiding the search for new magnetoelectrics .",
    "one example is the perovskite eutio@xmath0.@xcite    bulk eutio@xmath0 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure]a , is a paraelectric antiferromagnet that displays a dielectric anomaly at the magnetic ordering temperature ( @xmath1 k).@xcite much more relevant to the possibility of magnetoelectric phase control were the pioneering experiments of katsufuji and takagi , which showed that eutio@xmath0 exhibits a magnetodielectric effect ; at low temperatures , the dielectric constant depends strongly on the magnitude of the external magnetic field.@xcite they suggested that this effect stemmed from spin - phonon coupling,@xcite i.e. , the dependence of the polar phonon frequencies on spin correlations .",
    "subsequent first - principles studies  @xcite and direct measurements of the phonon frequencies under magnetic field@xcite have largely confirmed this picture .     in the cubic phase .",
    "( b ) sketch of g - type antiferromagnetic order .",
    "arrows denote the direction of spins . ]    regarding the magnetoelectric properties of eutio@xmath0 , it was shown from first principles how the underlying physics leading to the observation of spin - phonon coupling can be exploited to enable control over the dielectric and the magnetic ground state.@xcite epitaxial strain was proposed as the explicit control `` knob '' that tunes the antiferromagnetic - paraelectric ground state into a simultaneous ferromagnetic - ferroelectric phase .",
    "furthermore it was argued that under increasing strain but before reaching this novel multiferroic phase , a giant magnetoelectric response would occur in the vicinity of the strain - induced phase transitions due to phase competition.@xcite subsequent experiments on epitaxially strained thin films have observed the strain induced ferromagnetic - ferroelectric phase  @xcite and also the suppression of the antiferromagnetic order by an external electric field,@xcite both of which are consistent with the original prediction , yet the giant magnetoelectric effect has yet to be observed ( possibly due to a lack of high quality substrates that would provide the necessary value of strain ) .    while it has been suggested that the physics of eutio@xmath0 largely originates from a cation - mediated exchange mechanism,@xcite the microscopic mechanism of the spin - phonon coupling , and subsequently of the magnetoelectric phase control , is unknown .",
    "here we ask an important , but overlooked , question whose answer makes these clear ; _ why is nt eutio@xmath0 a ferroelectric in bulk _ ?",
    "before we begin discussing our results we must make it clear in what sense we are `` surprised '' that eutio@xmath0 is not ferroelectric in bulk .",
    "first , note the similarity to the perovskite srtio@xmath0 : both compounds in the cubic phase have almost identical lattice constants ( to two significant figures ) , both have nominally ti@xmath2 in an oxygen octahedral environment , and both have an a@xmath3 cation on the a - site .",
    "in fact these two perovskite compounds have very similar band structures . both have a charge transfer gap  between filled oxygen 2p states and empty ti d states  of similar magnitude .",
    "the only major difference is the presence of narrow eu 4f bands in eutio@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dos]a and [ fig : dos]b ) .",
    "( the 4f character of the valence band is also experimentally observed.@xcite ) these 4f electrons , however , are well localized and shielded by the 5s and 5p electrons . as a result , they are not expected to contribute significantly to chemical bonding .",
    "because of these facts there is good reason to believe that the structural and dielectric properties of eutio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 should be quite similar .",
    "consistent with this conjecture is the observation that both compounds undergo a structural phase transition due to the softening of a zone - boundary , antiferrodistortive mode ( corresponding to a rotation of the octahedra).@xcite in eutio@xmath0 , however , this occurs at a much higher temperature ( @xmath4100k for srtio@xmath0 , @xmath4300k for eutio@xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite even more surprising is the fact that srtio@xmath0 displays a static dielectric constant of @xmath5 at low temperature.@xcite this huge dielectric constant has been explained in a picture of a nominally unstable zone - center polar phonon mode being weakly stabilized by quantum fluctuations ,  @xcite and as such , is referred to as a quantum paraelectric . indeed , first - principles calculations of the infrared - active ( polar ) phonons within density functional theory , dft , have shown that at the experimental lattice constant , srtio@xmath0 displays a weak ferroelectric instability .",
    "( all dft studies of srtio@xmath0 that we know of used the most common formulation of dft , which is a static theory where fluctuations of the nuclei , quantum or thermal , are not considered ) .",
    "quantum monte carlo studies of a first - principles parameterized effective hamiltonian indeed show that this ferroelectric state is suppressed by quantum fluctuations,@xcite consistent with a picture of srtio@xmath0 being a quantum paraelectric .",
    "in contrast , for eutio@xmath0 , first - principles calculations of the polar phonons within dft at the experimental cubic lattice constant have shown that all the polar modes are quite hard , with the softest mode being @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore hard to imagine that eutio@xmath0 is close to a ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "consistent with this is the fact that the low temperature ( @xmath8 5k ) dielectric constant of eutio@xmath0 is two orders of magnitude smaller , @xmath9 , than in srtio@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite while there appears to be a `` rounding off '' of the dielectric constant below @xmath8 10k in eutio@xmath0 , which people consider to be an observable effect of quantum fluctuations , we stress that eutio@xmath0 would remain a paraelectric even in their absence .",
    "this is clear from every dft study ever conducted  @xcite and from the experimental determination of the cochran fit to soft - mode frequency , which gives @xmath10 @xmath7 at zero temperature.@xcite because of these facts we would not refer to eutio@xmath0 as a quantum paraelectric .",
    "our question should therefore be understood within the following sense : given that lattice instabilities in a@xmath3tio@xmath0 perovskites tend to be controlled by volume ( baring chemistry differences , e.g. , the pb@xmath3 lone - pair cation ) , and that srtio@xmath0 and eutio@xmath0 have almost identical volumes in the cubic phase , what leads to the giant hardening of the soft polar mode is eutio@xmath0 compared with srtio@xmath0 ?",
    "what seems to be the only possible explanation is that somehow the eu 4f electrons have a giant effect on the lattice instabilities : dramatically decreasing ( increasing ) the tendency for eutio@xmath0 to display a ferroelectric instability ( rotational instability ) .    ,",
    "calculated from first - principles .",
    "( b ) dos of srtio@xmath0 , calculated from first - principles .",
    "the zero points of energy in the dos plots are aligned with the highest occupied level , and are also shown by the vertical red lines . ]    in this article we discuss the answer to these questions , thereby providing a microscopic picture of spin - phonon , or more accurately spin - lattice , coupling in eutio@xmath0 from first principles .",
    "( note , the physics of spin - phonon coupling that we are discussing is in actuality a spin - lattice coupling , i.e. , the effect of the magnetic order / correlations on the force constants , an inherently static quantity.@xcite ) we explain our methods in section [ sec : methods ] and give a brief background on eutio@xmath0 in section [ sec : background ] . in section [ sec : u ] , we explain the evolution of the polar soft - mode frequency under changing hubbard-@xmath11 .",
    "we then elucidate the key role played by the hybridization of the filled eu 4f states with those of the nominally empty ti d states in section  [ hybrid ] . in section  [ ferro ] we show how this leads to a giant hardening of the polar soft mode , subsequently driving eutio@xmath0 away from ferroelectricity and rendering it a paraelectric with a small dielectric constant . in section  [ spin_phonon ]",
    "we explore the magnetic order dependence of this hybridization and show how it is the dominant cause of spin - lattice coupling . in section  [ rotations ]",
    "we argue that the much stronger oxygen octahedral rotations in eutio@xmath0 compared to srtio@xmath0 also originates from the hybridization of the eu f electrons .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "first - principles calculations were performed within density functional theory using the pbe - gga exchange - correlation functional@xcite and the projector augmented wave method@xcite as implemented in vasp.@xcite because of the well - known deficiency of pbe - gga in describing the localized nature of f - electrons of e.g. , eu , the dft+u formalism is used.@xcite the on - site exchange @xmath12 is kept fixed at 1.0 ev , while a hubbard-@xmath13 ev was found to give the best fit to experiment ( where we compared the ratio of the n@xmath14el to curie temperatures calculated within mean field theory ) .",
    "the value of @xmath11 , however , is often varied in our calculations in order to probe the physics of the system , as will be described .",
    "the cubic lattice constant is kept fixed to the experimental value of @xmath15  .",
    "phonon frequencies are calculated using both density functional perturbation theory and frozen phonons technique and no discrepancy is observed .",
    "we made extensive use of the isotropy software package@xcite and the bilbao crystallographic server@xcite .",
    "visualization of crystal structures are made using vesta.@xcite maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf ) are calculated using the wannier90 code.@xcite",
    "the cubic crystal structure of perovskite eutio@xmath0 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : structure]a .",
    "rotations of oxygen octahedra , which are known to exist in bulk eutio@xmath0 , were recently shown to have a strong effect on magnetism .",
    "@xcite in particular , they alter the magnetic exchange interactions in a way that strongly favors antiferromagnetism over ferromagnetism .",
    "additionally , rotations tend to suppress the tendency towards ferroelectricity.@xcite in the epitaxial strain phase diagram of eutio@xmath0 this results in an increase in the critical strain value necessary to induce a transition form the paraelectric - antiferromagnetic phase to the ferroelectric - ferromagnetic phase . for tensile strain , however , this increase in critical strain is almost canceled by the larger value of hubbard-@xmath11 , which lowers the critical strain , that is now necessary to give a reasonable fit of the magnetic exchange interactions in the presence of rotations to experiment ( see ref .   for a complete discussion ) .",
    "magnetism in eutio@xmath0 stems from the half filled 4f shell of the europium cation , which have 7 electrons in a high - spin state .",
    "these well localized spins order in a collinear g - type antiferromagnetic fashion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : structure]b ) so that the spin of each eu cation is opposite to all of its nearest neighbors .",
    "as seen in the density of states ( dos ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos]a , there is a wide charge transfer gap between the the occupied o - p states and the conduction band that consists of unoccupied ti - d states .",
    "the half - occupied eu 4f states form narrow bands below the fermi level in this charge transfer gap .",
    "there is very little hopping between the eu-4f orbitals and the neighboring cations , since the radii of the 4f orbitals are much smaller than that of the 5s or 5p orbitals .",
    "this is the reason that the n@xmath14el temperature is low , and the eu - f bands are narrow .",
    "( the n@xmath14el temperature is further lowered because of the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions . )",
    "the hubbard - u applied on the eu - f states ( @xmath11 ) shifts the energy level of the narrow eu - f bands , and hence determines the gap between them and the ti d or o p bands .",
    ", vs. the on - site interaction @xmath11 on eu 4f orbitals .",
    "red squares and blue asterisks denote the frequencies calculated in afm and fm states respectively . ]      to begin unraveling the mechanism behind the soft mode behavior of eutio@xmath0 , we perform a thought experiment where we calculate the frequencies , @xmath16 , of the polar phonons of cubic ( space group pm@xmath17 m ) eutio@xmath0 from first principles , for several different values of the hubbard - u ( applied to the eu - f states , @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : softmode ] .",
    "note that the frequency at a value of @xmath18 ev reproduces well the experimental value , @xmath19 @xmath7 , determined from a cochran fit .",
    "frequency remarkably close to the experiment . ]",
    "there are two clear trends in fig .",
    "[ fig : softmode ] : ( i ) as is now well - known , @xmath16 is lower in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state , which explains  @xcite an increase in the ionic contribution to the dielectric constant ,  @xcite @xmath20 , under external magnetic field , and ( ii ) @xmath16 depends sensitively on @xmath11 . with regards to the latter ,",
    "notice how a relatively modest increase in @xmath11 greatly decreases @xmath16 .",
    "this is surprising as the polar soft - mode of eutio@xmath0 is driven by the off - centering of the ti@xmath2 cation , i.e. , b - site driven , in a second order jahn - teller like process  @xcite ( we elaborate on this below ) , and therefore it is not expected to depend so sensitively on the energy of the eu bands , or @xmath11 . furthermore , the hubbard-@xmath11 acts only on the 4f shell of the eu ion , which has a smaller radius than the fully occupied 5s and 5p shells , making a direct effect on the phonon frequencies less likely .    these observations ,",
    "along with the fact that magnetism originates from the unpaired electrons on eu , suggests that the eu - f states may play a role in the origin of spin - lattice coupling . to probe this further , next we take a closer look at the spin - dependent hybridization of eu - f electrons with other orbitals and with its effect on the soft - mode behavior .",
    "despite the small radii of the eu 4f orbitals , there are no bands purely of eu character .",
    "this is seen in the site - projected density of states ( dos ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos]a .",
    "the dos peak right below the fermi level is of dominantly eu - f character , i.e. , the wavefunctions in the energy window corresponding to this peak are mostly localized on the eu ions , and have the symmetry of f states .",
    "there is , however , a small but non - zero contribution from ti and o ions to this peak as well , indicating that the eu - f states hybridize with both ti and o atomic orbitals.@xcite this becomes strikingly clear by considering maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs).@xcite in figure [ fig : wannier_example ] , we show two examples of occupied eu f mlwfs , @xmath21 and @xmath22 wannier orbitals .",
    "the cubic harmonics corresponding to these orbitals are proportional to @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "of particular interest is the eu - ion s @xmath22 wannier orbital , fig .  [",
    "fig : wannier_example]b , which has lobes directed towards the ti cation .",
    "notice that the mlwf is mostly localized around the ion s core .",
    "there is , however , a small , but nonzero , weight around the neighboring ti ions .",
    "this is an explicit sign that this eu state hybridizes with a nominally empty ti - d state(s ) .",
    "this hybridization is important for several reasons , e.g. , it has been shown previously that it leads to a superexhange interaction mediated through the ti cations .",
    "@xcite    our interest here is in the fact that this component of the mlwf can be thought as representing the partial occupation of the ti - d orbitals .",
    "it turns out that the dependance of this hybridization on a hubbard - u applied to the eu - f states , @xmath11 , brings out the underlying physics of spin - phonon coupling in eutio@xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargeti ] , we plot the total charge within the ti - d manifold of states due to the hybridization with eu - f states ( @xmath25 ) as a function of @xmath11 , considering both the ground state g - type antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spin configurations .",
    "we obtain @xmath25 by integrating the dos projected onto the ti - d shell over the energy window corresponding to the eu - f bands ( between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ev ) .",
    "this quantity , @xmath25 , is also related to the weight of the eu - f mlwfs localized on a ti site seen in fig .  [",

    "( i ) @xmath25 decreases with increasing @xmath11 and ( ii ) @xmath25 is larger in the afm state compared to the fm one .",

    "red squares and blue asterisks denote values in afm and fm states respectively . ]",
    "the latter will be explained in the proceeding section while the former , a change in the amount of hybridization with increasing @xmath11 , is not surprising . adding a coulomb interaction , u , to dft causes the corresponding orbitals to become more local .",
    "increasing @xmath11 makes it energetically favorable for electrons to remain localized in eu - f orbitals .",
    "also , as observed in ref . , the eu - f bands move away in energy from the conduction band when @xmath11 is increased . as a result , the hybridization between the eu - f and the ti - d states decreases .",
    "this is also clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : wannieru ] , where the @xmath22 mlwf is plotted for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "as the coulomb interaction increases , the lobes localized near the ti cation get smaller and eventually disappear , consistent with a decreasing @xmath25 .",
    "orbitals on @xmath28 neighbor eu ions and the intermediate ti ion s @xmath29 orbital .",
    "( b ) energy levels of the three orbitals in the fm state .",
    "lowest lying excitations where an electron hops onto the ti cation , ( c ) and ( d ) , are allowed , but not both the electrons can hop at the same time because of pauli exclusion ( e ) .",
    "however , in the afm state , ( f ) , not only the lowest excitations ( g ) and ( h ) but also the correlated hopping sketched in ( i ) is allowed . ]",
    "ferroelectricity in prototypical perovskite ferroelectrics such as batio@xmath0 originates from a `` cross - gap '' hybridization  @xcite of a cation s empty orbitals at the bottom of the conduction band ( typically either a transition metal cation s d - orbitals , e.g. , ti@xmath2 , or a lone pair active cation s p - orbitals , e.g. , bi@xmath30 ) and the occupied p states of the oxygens at the top of the valence band .",
    "this mechanism can be thought of as a second order jahn - teller like process .",
    "@xcite this is the mechanism for ferroelectricity in strained eutio@xmath0 . here , the displacement of a ti cation towards one of the oxygens increases the ti-3d / o-2p hybridization , thereby moving the hybridized empty states to higher energies , while lowering the energy of the hybridized occupied states .",
    "this `` rehybridization '' leads to a second order energy gain favoring ferroelectricity .",
    "if , however , the transition metal d states are partially occupied , there is an extra energy cost associated with moving these states to higher energies , and the tendency towards ferroelectricity is reduced.@xcite this argument has been mentioned often in the context of the incompatibility of ferroelectricity with b - site magnetism,@xcite and is central to both the suppression of ferroelectricity and the origin of spin - lattice coupling in eutio@xmath0 .",
    "but first we must understand why @xmath25 is larger in the afm state than in a state with parallel spins ( fm ) .",
    "consider the eu - ti - eu exchange pathway along the [ 111 ] direction . in bulk eutio@xmath0",
    "these eu cations have a strong afm interaction , which leads to the observation of ( predominantly ) g - type magnetic order.@xcite in fig .",

    "[ fig : hybridsketch]b , we sketch the energy levels of the three orbitals in this state .",
    "notice that an electron from either eu cation is allowed by symmetry to hop to the ti cation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hybridsketch]c and d ) , but that the higher order process where both electrons hop to the ti atom simultaneously ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hybridsketch]e ) is not allowed due to pauli exclusion principle .",

    "electrons can delocalize to the @xmath31 states of the ti ion more . ] as a thought experiment , initially consider bulk eutio@xmath0 in which the eu - f / ti - d hybridization was removed .",
    "one way this can be done from first - principles is by putting the f - electrons in the core of the paw potential . in this case , the ti - d states are essentially empty and are free to hybridize with the o-2p states as the ti@xmath2 cations move off - center , creating a polar lattice distortion is a second - order jahn - teller process . in this case",

    "our calculations directly confirm this . turning on the eu - f / ti - d hybridization , by moving the f - eletroncs from the core of the paw potential to the valence , increases the occupancy of the ti d states .",
    "this lowers the energy gained from the 2nd order jahn - teller thereby decreasing the tendency towards ferroelectricity , and thus hardening the polar soft - mode .",
    "this not only explains the suppression of ferroelectricity in eutio@xmath0 but also our previous result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : softmode ] ( another `` dial '' one can turn to remove , albeit partially , the eu - f / ti - d hybridization , and thus increase the tendency towards ferroelectricity , is to increase the hubbard - u applied to the eu f states , @xmath11 . )    ) for the four @xmath32 point symmetry adapted modes ( left ) and the corresponding displacement patterns ( right ) .",

    "one question that is natural to ask at this point is whether the emergence of ferroelectricity in eutio@xmath0 films under biaxial strain@xcite is related to a decrease in the eu - f / ti - d hybridization . in order to check this possibility , we calculated the dos and @xmath25 for eutio@xmath0 under biaxial strain , not taking into account oxygen octahedral rotations or polarization .",

    ", the local rotation angle is much larger than the average one.@xcite the local value , which is about 8 degrees , agrees well with dft.@xcite ] note that one should be able to ignore the effect of changing @xmath11 on the eu - o covalent bonding as the unoccupied eu - f states lie at energies much higher than the fermi level , above the empty eu - s states .",
    "the change in the rotation angle with @xmath11 , therefore , should be attributed solely to the changes in the eu - f / ti - d hybridization .     in the fm and the afm states and the cubic structure with lattice constant fixed to 3.90  .",
    "the horizontal black line corresponds to the soft mode frequency in srtio@xmath0 , calculated with the same settings .",

    "the horizontal black line corresponds to the rotation angle in srtio@xmath0 , calculated with the same settings .",
    "lines connecting the data points are provided to guide the eye . ]",
    "we also performed similar calculations to compare euzro@xmath0 with srzro@xmath0 , using the same rotation pattern as eutio@xmath0 .",
    "the rotation angle difference between these two zirconates is as small as @xmath41 .",
    "this is because euzro@xmath0 has a much larger band gap than eutio@xmath0 , and as a result there is not a significant hybridization between the eu - f and the zr - d states that strengthens the octahedral rotations .",
    "the same applies to euhfo@xmath0 , which has an octahedral rotation angle of @xmath42 ; merely @xmath43 degrees larger than srhfo@xmath0 .",
    "in summary , by employing dft+u calculations and mlwfs , we elucidated the key role played by the eu - f / ti - d hybridization in eutio@xmath0 .",
    "the resultant charge transferred to the ti - d states ( @xmath25 ) drives the system away from a ferroelectric ( or quantum paraelectric ) phase , and causes a dielectric behavior manifestly different from that of srtio@xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath25 on the magnetic order causes the polar soft - mode frequency to depend on the magnetic state .",
    "this is the leading contribution to spin - phonon coupling in eutio@xmath0 .",
    "octahedral rotations are also affected from eu f states hybridization with ti d orbitals , and are stronger in eutio@xmath0 compared to srtio@xmath0 as a result .",
    "these results underline the importance of rare earth f electrons in the lattice dynamics and dielectric behavior of tm oxides.@xcite while the present study is focused on eutio@xmath0 , similar effects could exist in other compounds as well . taking advantage of the hybridization of rare earth cation with the tm ion",
    "might be used as a new knob to tune the system away or close to the ferroelectric transition or perhaps to a quantum critical point .",
