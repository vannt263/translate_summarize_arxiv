    "in the spring of 2010 , the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) was used to map a large region around the little ( local irregulars that trace luminosity extremes ) things ( the hi nearby galaxy survey ) magellanic - type dwarf irregular ( dim ) galaxy ngc 1569 in line emission .",
    "little things is an international collaboration formed to study star formation in gas rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "there are 41 dwarfs in our sample and we have a rich multi - wavelength data set including high spatial ( @xmath26@xmath3 ) and spectral ( 2.6 or 5.2 ) resolution  data acquired with the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "we are adding to this multi - wavelength dataset wide - field gbt  emission maps around each object .",
    "the purpose of these observations is to study the extended  environment around these mostly isolated , field dwarf galaxies .",
    "ngc 1569 is one of the galaxies in the little things survey and a detailed study of the high resolution vla data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) prompted a follow - up investigation of high sensitivity , deep  gbt observations .",
    "please see @xcite for more information on the little things survey .",
    "the gbt was used to search for extended neutral hydrogen structures that would give evidence of tidal interactions between ngc 1569 and other ic 342 group members .",
    "dwarf galaxies are believed to be the building blocks of larger galaxies @xcite , yet the role of dwarf - dwarf galaxy interactions and mergers in the local universe is not well known .",
    "recently , however , there have been attempts from theory to explain some of the local dwarf systems as dwarf - dwarf induced mergers or interactions @xcite .",
    "even still , observations are lacking for a complete statistical view of the role of dwarf - dwarf interactions and mergers , especially for relatively isolated dwarf systems . searching for extended  filaments , bridges , tails , clouds , rings , and other structures around likely interacting dwarf",
    "galaxy candidates offers the most probable method for identifying merging and interacting systems as  is usually the most massive tidal component in a gas - rich interaction or merger @xcite .",
    "if dwarf galaxies mimic their more massive spiral galaxy counterparts , then starburst systems are the most likely objects to have undergone recent interaction or merger activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 1569 is one of the nearest examples of a starburst dim galaxy , and it contains three supermassive star clusters ( sscs ) .",
    "paper i presents a detailed study of the gas and stellar kinematics of ngc 1569 and compares the kinematics with the morphology of h@xmath4 and optical images .",
    "we determined a ratio of maximum rotation speed to stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath5/@xmath6 = 2.4 @xmath7 0.7 , that is consistent with a thick stellar disk .",
    "a region near ssc a where the stellar velocity dispersion _ increases _ by @xmath213  was detected , potentially indicating an area where a second generation of stars formed out of shocked , accelerated gas expanding around ssc a. paper i modeled the contribution of stars and gas to the gravitational potential of the galaxy and found that the stellar mass dominates the gravitational potential in the inner 1 kpc ( nearly half ) of the disk , which is unusual in disk galaxies and dwarfs in particular .    in paper",
    "i , we observed that the velocity field of ngc 1569 has strong non - circular motions over the entire disk .",
    "these non - circular motions were deconvolved from ordered motion and a non - circular motion ( ncm ) cloud was detected .",
    "we concluded that this ncm cloud is impacting the disk southwest of the sscs .",
    "this cloud was also seen in the work by @xcite .",
    "the ncm cloud is likely responsible for the recent starburst . in this picture , this cloud , with a velocity difference @xmath250  from the systemic velocity of ngc 1569 , shocked a dense ridge that stretched across what is now the stellar disk .",
    "as the ncm cloud fell into the center of the galaxy , it caused the middle of the dense ridge to collapse , thus creating the most recent starburst episode during which the sscs formed .",
    "paper i observed an ultra - dense cloud that lies to the west of the sscs that is believed to be a remnant of the dense ridge .",
    "the ncm cloud is hitting the galaxy where the ultra - dense cloud and the stellar disk meet ( see figures 1 , 18 and 19 in paper i ) .    from the high resolution",
    "vla data , paper i found tenuous emission extending south and north of the disk of ngc 1569 . because of the recent starburst , the presence of the ncm and ultra - dense clouds , peculiar stellar and gas kinematics , and tenuous emission around the disk of the galaxy , paper i determined that ngc 1569 is likely undergoing an interaction or merger .",
    "the triggering mechanism for the starburst , however , has remained controversial . until recently , ngc 1569 was thought to be an isolated system in the projected direction of the ic 342 group of galaxies , thus making the interaction scenario unlikely .",
    "it lies close to the galactic plane and is highly obscured , which made accurate distance determination difficult .",
    "@xcite found a distance of 4.7 mpc from the center of the -line velocity profile where they assumed a hubble constant of 50 .",
    "@xcite produced a distance of 1.8 mpc from fitting a johnson s @xmath8 vs @xmath9 color magnitude diagram .",
    "the most commonly quoted distance of late was 2.2 @xmath7 0.6 mpc , which came from @xcite who constrained the foreground extinction using uv photometry , thus modifying the previously adopted distance moduli from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected the tip of the red giant branch using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and published a new distance of 3.36 @xmath7 0.20 mpc placing ngc 1569 well within the ic 342 galaxy group .",
    "this distance has been refined to the most up - to - date published distance of 2.96 @xmath7 0.22 mpc @xcite , which puts ngc 1569 at the near edge of the ic 342 galaxy group .",
    "this is the distance assumed for ngc 1569 in this work . having a galaxy group association opens up the possibility that ngc 1569 may have undergone an interaction or merger , which is a natural way to produce a starburst and explain the observed chaotic kinematics of the stars and gas .",
    "however , @xcite find that not all interactions form starbursts in dwarf galaxies and they suggest that gas mass oscillations within a dark matter halo can be a dominant triggering mechanism for starburst dwarfs .",
    "detecting  tidal structures in the outskirts of ngc 1569 can be valuable for identifying the starburst triggering mechanism .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section [ sec:1 ] outlines the observations and data reductions ; section [ sec:5 ] gives the results ; section [ sec:2 ] examines the analysis and presents a discussion ; section [ sec:3 ] explores the implications of the extended emission ; and section [ sec:4 ] summarizes the conclusions .",
    "the gbt data were collected over the course of four months , 2010 february  2010 may .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] lists the details of the telescope and observations .",
    "the observations were taken using the l - band receiver centered at 1.420 ghz using a bandwidth of 12.5 mhz and 16,384 channels , producing an initial channel separation of 0.158 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the gbt has a beam size , half - power beam width ( hpbw ) , of 9@xmath111 .",
    "on - the - fly mapping was used with nyquist sampling , which produced a pixel size of @xmath23@xmath115 .",
    "a 5@xmath12 ( rms noise ) sensitivity of @xmath13 = 1.4 x @xmath14 @xmath15 was achieved for a velocity line width , full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , of 20 . in order to observe the full 9@xmath0 @xmath16 2@xmath0 ( @xmath17 @xmath16 @xmath18 ) region shown in figure [ fig:11 ] ,",
    "the total area was divided up into four 2@xmath0 @xmath16 2@xmath0 squares ( regions a , b , c , and d in bottom panel of figure [ fig:11 ] ) and one 1@xmath0 @xmath16 2@xmath0 rectangle ( region e in bottom panel of figure [ fig:11 ] ) .",
    "additionally , one 2@xmath0 @xmath16 1@xmath0 rectangle ( region f in figure [ fig:11 ] ) was added to study an area to the southeast of ngc 1569 .",
    "each region was mapped six times in rows of constant galactic longitude where each row was separated by a pixel , 3@xmath19 .",
    "these maps were co - added together for a total integration time of 36 seconds per pixel .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] lists the dates that each region was mapped . to calibrate the spectra ,",
    "in - band frequency switching was used and the frequency was switched between the center of the line of the rest frequency and @xmath20 mhz from the rest frequency for a full switching cycle of 1 second . in - band frequency switching was preferred to position switching because the milky way emission is very close to ngc 1569 in position and systemic velocity . to calibrate the flux , observations of 3c147",
    "were done at the start of most observing runs .",
    "the data reductions were done using gbtidl and aips .",
    "standard calibration procedures in gbtidl were used to calibrate the data and trim the edges of the spectra .",
    "there were a few rfi signals present in the spectra that were generated from within the gbt receiver room , which were less than one channel wide , and were removed by interpolating the surrounding channels . also , gbtidl was used to remove residual instrumental baseline structure by applying a low - order polynomial .",
    "the bandwidth was wide enough that there were more than 350 channels ( after smoothing ) that were free of emission to either side of the channels with emission that were used to model the baseline effectively .",
    "the baseline stability of the gbt is unparalleled because of its unblocked aperture and its location within the national radio quiet zone .",
    "therefore , the uncertainties from the baseline fitting are minimal .",
    "the final data were hanning and boxcar smoothed to a velocity resolution and channel separation of 0.81 km s@xmath10 , leaving 1201 channels spanning a velocity range of -461.1 to 505.2 km s@xmath10 ( all velocities in this paper are heliocentric ) .",
    "see table [ tab : obs ] for a list of the telescope parameters .",
    "all of the spectra were combined ( dbcon ) into a single cube and gridded ( sdgrd ) in aips using a spherical bessel function @xcite .",
    "the map includes four galaxies , ngc 1569 , ugca 92 ( the nearest object to ngc 1569 ) , ic 342 ( the nearest large spiral galaxy to ngc 1569 ) , and ugca 86 ( a dwarf galaxy close to ic 342 in the direction of ngc 1569 ) .",

    "a large ,  is identified and it is visible from -115.6 to -111.6 , which are velocities coincident with those of ngc 1569 .",
    "velocity panel -111.6 marks two long structures that resemble intergalactic v - shaped filaments and an  knot is identified in panel -106.7  that may be emission associated with the filamentary structures .",
    "velocity panels -110.8  and -105.9  identify emission that is likely foreground and associated with the milky way warp .",
    "the  and filaments and their association with ngc 1569 ( or lack thereof ) is discussed in detail in section [ sec:2.1 ] .    figure [ fig:2 ] shows emission from three single channels that contain milky way emission to demonstrate the range of milky way structures and intensities seen throughout the data .",
    "these three channels are at velocities between ngc 1569/ugca 92 and ic 342/ugca 86 .",
    "the locations of the four galaxies are identified by the contours . also , the bottom two panels of figure [ fig:2 ] , show part of the  disk of ic 342 that is highly obscured by the milky way but is visible because of the high velocity resolution of the gbt data .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows three individual channels that contain ic 342 and ugca 86 and their respective  structures .",
    "an ` spur ' attached to the north of ugca 86 as described by @xcite , is identified in the bottom two panels .",

    "this cloud has a peak intensity of 0.6 k , a velocity width of @xmath210  ( from 33.3 to 43.0 ) , and an integrated column density of @xmath13 = 2.9 @xmath16 10@xmath23 @xmath15 .",
    "the origins of this cloud are currently unknown",
    ". it may be foreground emission from the milky way , although it is offset by 11  in velocity from the milky way , or it could be a dwarf galaxy , although there is no known stellar component ( stsci digitized sky survey ( dss ) , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) , and the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) were searched ; this region is outside of the sloan digitized sky survey ( sdss ) footprint ) . if this cloud were at the average distance of the ic 342 galaxy group , 3.28 mpc @xcite , then it would contain an  mass of 1.3 @xmath16 10@xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "no distance information can be obtained from the data in hand and further studies are needed to determine the nature and origin of this cloud . therefore , the mass estimate is not included in table [ tab:2 ] .    table [ tab:2 ] lists average column densities and total masses for all the features described .",
    "the aips task ispec was used to integrate rectangular regions of the map over consecutive channels in order to calculate the total flux of the features .",
    "these fluxes were then converted into average column densities and masses , assuming the distances in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the spiral galaxy ic 342 does not have a column density or mass stated because a large part of ic 342 is masked by the milky way .",
    "the purpose of these gbt observations is to determine if there is extended emission connecting ngc 1569 to members of the ic 342 galaxy group .",
    "ic 342 is approximately 290 kpc at a distance of 3 mpc , projected on the sky , from ngc 1569 . at the sensitivity limit of @xmath13 = 1.4",
    "x @xmath14 @xmath15 ( 5@xmath12 for 20  line width ) , no extended structures connecting ic 342 or ugca 86 to ngc 1569 were detected .",
    "however , milky way emission lies between ngc 1569 and ic 342/ugca 86 in velocity , so there could be tenuous structures connecting these objects that are blended with milky way  emission .",
    "the data are analyzed in two parts , first ngc 1569 and ugca 92 are discussed , and second , ic 342 and ugca 86 are examined .",
    "two distinct structures were detected that are suggestive as having a connection to ngc 1569 .",
    "the first is a large cloud with a diameter of 0@xmath15 ( about 26 kpc ) that has the same position and velocity as ngc 1569 .",
    "the cloud is elongated and extends south toward ugca 92 .",
    "it is visible in @xmath26 channels in figure [ fig:1 ] , giving it a velocity width of only @xmath24 km s@xmath10 and it has an average column density of @xmath13 = 5.7 x 10@xmath23 cm@xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows velocity channel -113.17 km s@xmath10 , which displays the prominent emission of the 0@xmath15 cloud .",
    "the white contours in the left image of figure [ fig:4 ] are high resolution vla integrated flux contours of ngc 1569 ( paper i ) that are over plotted on the gbt map for identification and to show the morphology .",
    "the right image shows the integrated intensity map ( figure 5 , paper i ) .",
    "the vla was able to resolve the strongest emission of the , as seen by the diffuse teardrop - shaped emission extending to the south of the galaxy disk . also prominent in the vla intensity map",
    "is tenuous emission stretching northeast of the disk , which is suggestive of a counter  `` tail '' .",
    "the intensity scales in figure [ fig:4 ] are shown in m@xmath27 pc@xmath28 for comparison and they are drastically different because the gbt image on the left is only a single 0.81  channel while the vla image on the right is the fully integrated intensity field .",
    "the second features discovered are two filaments joined together in a v - shape extending out from ngc 1569 and the  in the direction of ugca 92 .",
    "these filaments are about 1@xmath15 long stretching nearly the entire projected distance to ugca 92 , which is roughly 77 kpc in length projected on the sky at the distance of ngc 1569 .",
    "the filaments have an average  column density of 4.9 x @xmath14 @xmath15 and an integrated mass of 5.6 x @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ fig : bil ] shows velocity channel -110.8  where the filaments are obvious .",
    "these filaments appear at more positive ( red - shifted ) velocities than the 0@xmath15 cloud .",
    "an angle of @xmath30 projected on the sky separates the two filaments .",
    "they are only visible in 6 channels and , therefore , have the same velocity width of @xmath24 km s@xmath10 as the 0@xmath15 cloud .",
    "there is a knot of emission that lingers at more red - shifted velocities than the filaments ( in velocity channels -107.5 to -105.1 ) , as identified in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "it is not clear if this emission is part of the filaments or not",
    ". table [ tab:2 ] shows the average column density and mass of the filaments , where the knot of emission in velocity panels -107.5 to -105.1  was included . from the gbt data presented here ,",
    "a total mass for ngc 1569 of 2.4 x @xmath31 was derived , assuming a distance of 2.96 mpc",
    ". this mass agrees with the mass of 1.8 x 10@xmath32 determined from vla data from paper i and the mass of 1.6 x 10@xmath32 derived by @xcite as well as the mass of 2.3 x 10@xmath32 determined by @xcite ( masses corrected for the adopted distance ) . for the 0@xmath15 cloud ,",
    "an average column density of 5.7 x @xmath14 @xmath15 and a mass of 2.6 x @xmath29 were calculated .",
    "the 0@xmath15 cloud has a mass about 10% of the total mass of ngc 1569 . a total combined mass for both the 0@xmath33 cloud and the filaments is 8.2 x @xmath29 , roughly 30% of the mass of ngc 1569 .",
    "these gbt data produce an  mass of 2.0 @xmath16 10@xmath34 @xmath35 for ugca 92 , compared to 1.56 @xmath16 10@xmath34 @xmath35 found by @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to foreground milky way emission that was added into the gbt mass .",
    "it is not possible to separate foreground milky way from ugca 92 or ngc 1569 .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig:6 ] shows a position - velocity diagram sliced through the data cube along the black line shown in the bottom panel , which is an integrated intensity map that includes ngc 1569 and ugca 92 .",
    "the 0@xmath36 angular offset on the x - axis of the top panel coincides with the center of the black line indicated in the bottom panel .",
    "the 0@xmath15 cloud is marked in the top panel as well as the milky way cloud , shown in figure [ fig:4 ] , that resides just south of ugca 92 .",
    "the horizontal black line in the top panel of figure [ fig:6 ] is to guide the eye along the -113  velocity line , which marks the velocity channel where the  is strongest in emission .",
    "the milky way cloud south of ugca 92 is red - shifted compared to the .",
    "also marked in the top panel of figure [ fig:6 ] , is the milky way and milky way warp velocity ranges .",
    "both ngc 1569 and ugca 92 have velocities that overlap with the milky way and milky way warp , as evidenced by the vertical light yellow features that stretch upwards at the locations of ngc 1569 and ugca 92 into the milky way emission where the velocities become more positive . however , the milky way warp at these velocities and positions is tenuous , as seen by the low flux of the milky way warp region marked in figure [ fig:6 ] , and the milky way disk emission is significantly offset in velocity from the 0@xmath15 cloud and filamentary features .",
    "the systemic velocity of ugca 92 is -99 km s@xmath10 , which coincides with the upper limit of the milky way warp velocity range .",
    "ngc 1569 has a systemic velocity of -85 km s@xmath10 , which is between the peak milky way and milky way warp velocities , although it is likely that there is some milky way emission at this velocity also . since both ngc 1569 and ugca 92 have velocities in the range of the milky way and the milky way warp",
    ", one would expect any extended features associated with either of these galaxies to also have velocities confused with the milky way .",
    "so how can one tell which features are milky way and which are associated with ngc 1569 and/or ugca 92 ?",
    "one way to approach this problem is to look at the line profiles of different features in the area around ngc 1569 and ugca 92 .",
    "figure [ fig:7 ] shows five line profiles of a single pixel each through the centers of different  features near ngc 1569 .",
    "the plots are at the velocities of the extended features in question and are plotted on the same temperature intensity scale .",
    "the exact positions of the line profiles are given in the upper left corner of the plots and correspond to the positions shown in the intensity image in figure [ fig:7](f ) .",
    "the 0@xmath15 cloud has a line profile that is narrower and has a lower intensity than the two milky way clouds in figures [ fig:7](b ) and [ fig:7](c ) .",
    "also , the wings of the line are broader than the milky way clouds line profiles , which could be from a mix of warm and cold  that one would expect associated with a galaxy such as ngc 1569 @xcite .",
    "foreground milky way clouds along the line of sight contain only one temperature component @xcite and thus , would not have broad wing features .",
    "the milky way cloud in figure [ fig:7](b ) , is a gaussian - like profile with a peak intensity at around 4.5 k , compared to a peak intensity of only 2.7 k for the 0@xmath15 cloud in [ fig:7](a ) .",
    "figure [ fig:7](c ) shows a line profile of a milky way cloud located at the bottom of the gbt map below ngc 1569 .",
    "this profile shows the cloud peak intensity is 4.2 k and the fwhm is broader compared to the 0@xmath15 cloud in [ fig:7](a ) .",
    "the velocity widths of the line profiles for the three clouds can also be seen in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the 0@xmath15 cloud is observed in only 6 channels ( @xmath37 @xmath2 4 km s@xmath10 ) while the milky way cloud directly below ugca 92 and the milky way cloud at the bottom of the map are seen in about 16 channels total ( @xmath37 @xmath2 12 km s@xmath10 ) , including two channels beyond what is shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "in addition , both of the line profiles for the two milky way clouds are slightly red - shifted compared to the 0@xmath15 cloud .",
    "this shift in velocity is also observed in figure [ fig:1 ] and figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "both milky way clouds have the same velocity range , they both appear in velocity channel -114.0  and disappear in velocity channel -100.3 , which is beyond figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the 0@xmath15 cloud is slightly blue - shifted compared to both of these milky way clouds , as figure [ fig:1 ] shows it first appearing in velocity channel -114.8 , compared to -112.4  for the milky way clouds .",
    "although this is only a 2.4 km s@xmath10 shift , the peaks of the line profiles for these milky way clouds in figure [ fig:7 ] are offset by about 2.5 km s@xmath10 from the 0@xmath15 cloud , in agreement with figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the centers of ngc 1569 and ugca 92 are also plotted in figures [ fig:7](d ) and [ fig:7](e ) , respectively .",
    "these line profiles are broad , as expected for rotating galaxies , but ngc 1569 shows a very narrow component at the peak of the flux .",
    "this narrow peak corresponds with the peak velocity of the 0@xmath15 cloud .",
    "it appears that the 0@xmath15 cloud overlaps with ngc 1569 in both position and velocity . in paper",
    "i , the vla observations show high velocity surrounding the galaxy as well as tenuous emission to the south and north ( see figure [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "all of this emission detected by the vla , matches the velocities of the 0@xmath15 cloud in our gbt map .",
    "perhaps the 0@xmath15 cloud is the source for these high velocity features seen surrounding ngc 1569 in the vla data .",
    "the filaments need a different analysis , as they are elongated features without a central core of concentrated emission . beginning with figure [ fig:1 ] , the filaments",
    "are observed in only about seven channels , similar to the 0@xmath15 cloud and they extend out of this cloud both spatially and in velocity forming a continuous velocity bridge connecting the disk of ngc 1569 , , and ending with the filaments . also , there are no other v - shaped features like these anywhere else in the data .",
    "tenuous wisps are seen throughout figure [ fig:2 ] but , none match the distinctive v - shape that the filaments exhibit .",
    "furthermore , the other wisps and filament - like structures seen in figure [ fig:2 ] are observed in more than just six channels and are much longer in length .",
    "figure [ fig : bil ] displays the entire mapped region for the velocity channel that contains the maximum emission from the filaments .",
    "the milky way cloud directly south of ugca 92 is prevalent and there are other tenuous filamentary structures visible in this field . even though the v - shape is distinct , it is not possible to directly separate foreground milky way emission from extragalactic emission at the velocities of the filaments or .",
    "as for other structures that may be contaminating the field such as high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) around the milky way , the only likely candidate is hvc complex h. however , according to an map of hvc complex h by @xcite , the hvc does not overlap with ngc 1569 or ugca 92 in position or velocity .",
    "there are no other hvcs in the vicinity of ngc 1569 that match position or velocity .",
    "although it is impossible to say definitively that the 0@xmath15 cloud and filaments are not part of the milky way , milky way warp , or any hvc associated with the milky way , the evidence ( blue - shifted velocity , narrow width , and wide wings of the line - profile of the 0@xmath15 cloud compared with other nearby milky way clouds , and the distinctive v - shape of filaments ) suggests that these structures are extragalactic in nature .",
    "another argument can be made in support of the extragalactic nature of the  and filaments from @xcite .",
    "they detect an older stellar population in ngc 1569 that stretches 6@xmath36 in the same direction and position of the .",
    "this stellar halo is suggestive of a tidally disturbed stellar disk , of which the implications will be discussed in section [ sec:3 ] .",

    "table [ tab:2 ] lists the mass of ugca 86 that was determined by summing over pixels that contained the body of the galaxy disk and did not include pixels that contained emission from the spur or tail . also , no channels below 10  were included in the calculation because of strong milky way emission below this velocity .",
    "the gbt data give a mass of 4.8 @xmath16 10@xmath39 @xmath35 for ugca 86 , which is comparable to the mass found by @xcite of 4.4 @xmath16 10@xmath39 @xmath35 , corrected for distance and subtracted for the spur contribution .",

    "ugca 86 has a short , pronounced spur to the north of the disk , as discussed previously and shown in figure [ fig:3 ] , which gives credence to the interaction being recent .",

    "@xcite explains that the timescales for interactions and subsequent starburst activity are quite different , as observed in systems like arp 299 and the antennae .",
    "the tidal tails in these large galaxies stretch for hundreds of kpcs and formed hundreds of millions of years ago while the starburst activity occurred only tens of millions of years ago and may be episodic @xcite . because of the recurring nature of the starbursts",
    ", one can not use the presence or absence of a starburst at the current time as an indication of when an interaction occurred .    staying with the assumption that there is no connecting  bridge lying off the edge of the map ,",
    "the tidal tails of ugca 86 and ic 342 are only a projected length of 31 and 40 kpc , respectively , which may mean that they are young features that havent had enough time to extend fully @xcite . if they were old features in the process of dissipating and falling back onto their host galaxies , then one would expect to see remnants of fine structure such as shells or loops @xcite , assuming that the potentials in both galaxies are relaxed .",
    "a rough estimation for the dynamical timescale of an interaction between ugca 86 and ic 342 can be made by using the velocity dispersion of the galaxy group , which is @xmath2 54  @xcite . using the projected distance of @xmath287 kpc , ugca 86 passed through pericenter @xmath21.5 gyr ago . mapping the region below ic 342 and",
    "ugca 86 at a lower sensitivity to  column density can be useful in determining the interaction history for these two galaxies .",
    "ngc 1569 is a complex galaxy with complex stellar and gas kinematics .",
    "the stars increase in velocity dispersion in the region of the sscs compared to the center of the galaxy , and the stellar mass dominates the inner disk s gravitational potential .",
    "the stars and gas are also kinematically coupled .",
    "the data show strong non - circular motions across all of the disk , as detailed from vla observations from paper i. there is a strong non - circular motion cloud to the south of the sscs that appears to be impacting the galaxy and could be responsible for the starburst and dense ridge and cloud that resides west of the sscs . also , there is tenuous emission detected with the vla south and north of ngc 1569 , and the velocities of this emission match those of the 0@xmath15 cloud discovered with the gbt .",
    "the gbt data also show v - shaped filaments extending a projected distance of 88 kpc in the direction of another dwarf ugca 92 .",
    "these observations paint a picture of a very disturbed dim galaxy and prompt three possible explanations for the evolution that lead to the system seen today : + 1 ) the extended features observed in the gbt map are primordial gas structures from cosmological filaments that are accreting onto ngc 1569 .",
    "this gas falls into the inner disk thereby creating the disturbed kinematics and starburst .",
    "+ 2 ) ngc 1569 is a merger remnant of two gas rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "+ 3 ) ngc 1569 is interacting with ugca 92 during which , the quiescent outer disk of ngc 1569 was disrupted and caused this gas to lose angular momentum and fall to the center .",
    "the possibility that the filaments and 0@xmath15 cloud seen in the gbt data are primordial gas from cosmological filaments is unlikely . in the early universe , primordial gas accretes onto galaxies through large - scale filamentary structures , which may be present around ngc 1569 .",
    "however , the chances of this neutral  gas surviving in a dense galaxy group to the present time is highly improbable .",
    "intergalactic uv photoionization causes low column density gas to become ionized and evaporate over a relatively short timescale ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the average column density of the filaments extending from ngc 1569 is 4.9 x 10@xmath23 @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , a primordial origin for these structures from cosmological filaments is disregarded .",
    "a merger is more plausible since merger remnants of large disk galaxies have similar characteristics as ngc 1569 , particularly the filaments and starburst activity , only on larger scales .",
    "for example , the ongoing merger arp 299 shows very long , parallel tidal tails that share the same velocities @xcite , which are similar to the filaments detected in ngc 1569 .",
    "arp 299 is also undergoing an intense starburst , and has very disturbed kinematics in both stars and @xcite .",
    "the mass ratio between the  disk of arp 299 and the  tails is @xmath22.6 , using the disk mass corrected for absorption from @xcite .",
    "ngc 1569 has a ratio of  mass in the disk to  mass of the  plus v - shaped filaments of @xmath22.9 , which is comparable to arp 299 . however , there are major differences between arp 299 and ngc 1569 .",
    "arp 299 has _",
    "stellar _ tidal tails and also contains two distinct nuclei @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a stellar halo of old stars that reaches 6@xmath36 south in the same direction as the  cloud .",
    "this is suggestive as being a tidally disturbed stellar disk , but there have been no studies to date designed to look for a low brightness stellar population in the filaments of ngc 1569 and a double nucleus is not observed .",
    "another example of a large disk merger remnant with two tidal filaments is ngc 1052 .",
    "there are two filaments extending out from ngc 1052 @xcite and it is also undergoing a starburst @xcite .",
    "however , ngc 1052 has an ionized gas disk that rotates perpendicular to the stellar disk @xcite , and has an e4 morphology ( ned ) .",
    "one of the striking results from paper i is that the stars and the gas of ngc 1569 kinematically follow each other , which is not what is observed in ngc 1052 .",
    "ngc 1569 does not have an elliptical shape but rather , is a thick disk .",
    "ngc 1052 also has an active nucleus and ngc 1569 does not .",
    "the merging scenario to explain the observed features of ngc 1569 is a compelling theory , but still there are obvious drawbacks when compared to larger merger remnant galaxies . in the case of arp 299 ,",
    "this merging system shows two distinct nuclei so , perhaps it is at an earlier stage of merging than ngc 1569 . on the other hand , dwarf galaxies do nt have nuclei so comparing these two objects may be crude at best .",
    "large spiral disk galaxies are more complex with supermassive black holes in their centers , spiral arms , and bulges in some that all combine for a more dramatic merging event than is expected in the dwarf galaxy regime .",
    "gas rich dwarfs do not have the sophisticated structure of their spiral galaxy counterparts nor do they contain supermassive black holes that can ignite and become active during a merging event as is the case of ngc 1052 . but no one , as yet , has modeled dwarf - dwarf galaxy mergers in isolation so understanding the morphological changes that can occur in these systems is unknown .",
    "spiral - spiral galaxy mergers generally produce elliptical systems .",
    "could this be the case for two merging disk dwarf galaxies , too ?",
    "if so , then perhaps the e4 galaxy ngc 1052 is at a later stage of merging than ngc 1569 , which may be on its way to becoming a de ( dwarf elliptical ) system",
    ".    there may be other evidence that ngc 1569 is a merger remnant from a study by @xcite where they describe a potential companion .",
    "is it possible that this companion is a gas remnant from a dwarf - dwarf galaxy merger that has formed ngc 1569 ?",
    "stil & israel suggest that the companion is either primordial gas settling into the potential well of ngc 1569 or it is a separate merging object .",
    "cosmological filaments carrying primordial gas as the source for the 0@xmath15 cloud and v - shaped filaments seen in the gbt data has already been disregarded , so it does not seem likely that the possible companion discussed by stil & israel is primordial in this sense .",
    "however , the companion could be part of a merging event that has created the starburst in ngc 1569 .",
    "the velocities of this companion match the velocities of the gbt 0@xmath15 cloud , which suggests that these structures may have a similar origin .",
    "if so , then it is also possible that the 0@xmath15 cloud came from a recent interaction with ugca 92 , thus , the companion may have formed from an interaction rather than a merger .",
    "since no assumptions can be made about the initial conditions of the progenitors that may have merged to form ngc 1569 , one can only theorize where this possible companion originated .",
    "the observations also suggest that ngc 1569 is interacting with ugca 92 .",
    "@xcite find an  diameter for ugca 92 of 9@xmath36 and a rotation velocity , corrected for internal pressure , of 37.08 .",
    "thus , a total dynamical mass for ugca 92 is 1.2 @xmath16 10@xmath42 @xmath35 .",
    "paper i finds a dynamical mass of ngc 1569 of 1.0 @xmath16 10@xmath42 @xmath35 ( corrected for distance ) , nearly equal to ugca 92 .",
    "however , when compared to the baryonic mass , ugca 92 has a baryonic - to - dynamic mass ratio , @xmath43/@xmath44 = 0.18 while ngc 1569 has @xmath43/@xmath44 = 0.37 .",
    "this means that ngc 1569 has roughly twice the amount of baryons for approximately the same amount of dynamical mass .",
    "could ugca 92 have lost some of its baryons to ngc 1569 during an interaction ?",
    "a more detailed analysis of ugca 92 is required in order to determine if this is the case .",
    "an example of an interacting large spiral galaxy is ngc 4631 .",
    "it is an intriguing analogue for comparison to ngc 1569 because it also has two filaments joined in a v - shape which extend out toward a nearby companion , ngc 4656 ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 4631 is also part of a galaxy group and is experiencing a starburst .",
    "the ratio of  mass in the disk of ngc 4631 to the total  mass of the filamentary features in the outskirts of the galaxy is @xmath25 , according to @xcite , and ngc 1569 has an  disk mass - to - extended feature mass of 2.9 .",
    "the similarity in morphology is striking .    according to simulations by @xcite",
    ", the speed of an encounter can affect the morphology of the tidal tails produced .",
    "high - velocity collisions produce tenuous gas tails with non - uniform density .",
    "duc & bournaud give a disk mass - to - tail mass ratio of @xmath232 , which is more than an order of magnitude higher than the 2.9 disk - to - extended  mass of ngc 1569 .",
    "also , duc & bournaud find that the tidal tails resulting from high - velocity collisions have high velocity gradients , which is completely the opposite for what is observed in ngc 1569 .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that a high - velocity collision was responsible for the formation of the extended  found near ngc 1569 .    @xcite state that from their models long and narrow tidal features associated with an interaction indicate an older passage between two interacting systems .",
    "similarly , @xcite explains that the timescales for a starburst and an interaction can be very different with an interaction taking place hundreds of millions of years in the past while starbursts are episodic with the most recent occurrence taking place only tens of millions of years ago . in the scheme presented by barnes & hibbard , the long , extended filaments of ngc 1569 are consistent with an older passage by ugca 92 .",
    "the timescale of the most recent starburst episode in ngc 1569 is on the order of 10 myr and this dim galaxy has had multiple bursts of intense star formation @xcite , consistent with the @xcite models .",
    "if ngc 1569 and ugca 92 are interacting , then one can make a rough estimate of how long ago the pericenter approach was by using the gbt projected distance between the objects of @xmath45 , which , at a distance of 2.96 mpc , corresponds to a physical distance of @xmath2103 kpc .",
    "if ngc 1569 and ugca 92 are moving through space at approximately the velocity dispersion of the galaxy group , which is 54  @xcite , then it would take about 950 myr for ngc 1569 to reach its present distance from ugca 92 , assuming ngc 1569 and ugca 92 are in the plane of the sky .",
    "the timescale of the most recent starburst and the time in which the last interaction could have occurred are roughly consistent with @xcite .",
    "thus , a picture of ngc 1569 that is roughly consistent with other observations and models of interacting disk galaxies is observed .",
    "the gbt data presented here have several exciting implications . newly discovered  and v - shaped filamentary features were found at the same position as ngc 1569 and contain velocities that form a continuous velocity sequence with the systemic velocity of ngc 1569 having the most red - shifted velocity ( -85 ) , the filaments containing intermediate velocities and the  having the most blue - shifted velocity .",
    "an analysis of the line profiles of the  clouds in the field around ngc 1569 , display characteristics that are suggestive as being slightly red - shifted from foreground milky way and also have narrower peaks and wider wings than milky way emission , suggesting a mix of warm and cold  medium , which is what one would expect in an extragalactic source .",
    "if the  and filaments are , in fact , extragalactic then they are most likely the result of an interaction between ngc 1569 and ugca 92 .",
    "this interaction scenario supports the hypothesis that the triggering mechanism for the recent starburst activity in ngc 1569 is from tidal forces , which created a loss of angular momentum in the outer  disk , causing material to fall to the center , providing the compression and subsequent cooling of gas necessary for a global starburst ( see paper i for more details ) .",
    "the results are outlined as follows : + 1 ) a large , , which is 26 kpc in diameter at the distance of ngc 1569 , was discovered at the same position and velocity as ngc 1569 and extends to the south toward ugca 92 .",
    "compared to other foreground milky way clouds in the vicinity of ngc 1569 , the  has a narrower velocity profile , is slightly blue - shifted from foreground milky way emission , and forms a continuous velocity bridge with the  disk of the galaxy .",
    "+ 2 ) two filaments joined together in a v - shape were discovered extending south from ngc 1569 perpendicular to the disk in the direction of ugca 92 .",
    "these filaments have narrow velocity widths and are the most blue - shifted structures that form a continuous velocity sequence connecting the  galaxy disk and .",
    "+ 3 ) the 0@xmath15 cloud and filaments are suggestive as extragalactic structures but could be foreground milky way .",
    "if they are indeed extragalactic , then they could be evidence for a recent interaction between ngc 1569 and ugca 92 .",
    "+ 4 ) in the velocity ranges of ugca 86 , a counter tidal tail was discovered on the opposite side of the disk from the spur identified by @xcite .",
    "this counter tail has velocities that follow a sequential velocity sequence with the spur ( which is red - shifted from the systemic velocity of the galaxy ) , main galaxy body and counter tail ( which is blue - shifted from the systemic velocity of the galaxy ) .",
    "this counter tail is likely associated with the spur , and was probably created in an interaction with ic 342 .",
    "+ 5 ) ic 342 also shows a surprising tail - like feature extending south toward ugca 86 .",
    "this tail is very tenuous and at the sensitivity limit of the gbt map , but has a velocity width of over 47 km s@xmath10 and has the same velocities as the counter tail discovered in ugca 86 .",
    "the two tails associated with ugca 86 and ic 342 discovered in the gbt map may form a continuous bridge that extends off the south edge of the map .",
    "more data are needed to confirm this hypothesis .    for future work ,",
    "i plan to map a deep , @xmath22@xmath46 region south of the current area around ic 342 and ugca 86 and combine these data with the data presented here to test whether the two tidal tails seen in both objects form a tidal bridge .",
    "also , i intend to investigate what morphologies would be expected from interactions between ngc 1569 and ugca 92 as well as ic 342 and ugca 86 using hydrodynamic simulations . by implementing all necessary physics , including stellar feedback",
