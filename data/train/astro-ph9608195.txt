    "reverberation mapping has became one of the major tools for studying the distribution and kinematics of the gas in the broad line region ( blr ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( see , e.g. , peterson 1993 , gondhalekar , horne , & peterson 1994 ) .",
    "about a dozen seyfert  1 galaxies have been successfully monitored so far . the time lags between the emission line and the continuum light curves measured in these objects can be interpreted in terms of the delayed response of the spatially - extended blr to the ionizing continuum source .",
    "the best studied seyfert 1 galaxy , ngc  5548 , was monitored from the ground for over 5 years , and from space for several long periods ( korista et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "several other seyfert 1s , such as ngc  4151 and mrk  279 , were observed for periods of order a year or less .",
    "while these observations have not uniquely determined the geometries of the blrs , they have established that seyfert  1 blrs have sizes of the order of a few light - days to light - weeks .    while much progress has been achieved in reverberation mapping of seyfert galaxies , relatively little is known about the blr size in high - luminosity agn .",
    "few spectrophotometric monitoring attempts of quasars have been made and most of these ( e.g. , zheng et al 1987 ; perez penston & moles 1989 ; gondahalekar 1990 ; korista 1991 ; jackson et al . 1992 ) resulted in no clear lag determinations , either due to poor sampling , or because no line variability was detected .",
    "some monitoring projects have yielded controversial results , such as , for example , the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ campaign on 3c  273 .",
    "obrien & harris ( 1991 ) report a lag of 74 days between the ly@xmath6 emission line and the continuum , while ulrich et al .",
    "( 1993 ) argue that the line variations are only marginally significant .",
    "since mid-1991 , we have been monitoring a well - defined sub - sample of 28 quasars from the palomar - green ( pg ) sample ( schmidt & green 1983 ) with typical sampling intervals of @xmath7 months . results of the first 1.5 years were presented in maoz et al .",
    "( 1994 ; paper  i ) where it was shown that most quasars had undergone continuum variations in the range of 10%    70% .",
    "balmer line variations that are correlated with the continuum changes were detected in several objects . based on those preliminary data , it was demonstrated that the emission - line response times in several quasars is @xmath86 months .",
    "reverberation mapping of these objects therefore requires several years , with sampling intervals of less than a few months .",
    "the need for a long temporal baseline is illustrated by the previous results for pg  0953 + 414 , for the periods 1987 - 89 and 1991 - 92 , presented in paper  i. despite continuum variations of @xmath935% , no clear line variations were detected . as we will show in this _ letter _",
    ", with a monitoring campaign of longer duration we detect the line variability in this object .",
    "we present 4 years of data for two radio - quiet quasars from our sample , pg  0804 + 762 and pg  0953 + 414 ( table  [ param ] ) .",
    "the two quasars show clear evidence of a time lag between the balmer lines and the continuum variations .",
    "we use this to set significant constraints on the blr size in these high - luminosity objects . in   2 we describe the observations , present the light curves , and carry out a cross - correlation analysis to determine the blr size . in   3",
    "we discuss the results .",

    "the observations and the reduction procedure are described in detail in paper  i. we repeat here the main points .",
    "the observations were carried out using the steward observatory 2.3 m telescope and the wise observatory 1 m telescope . for each quasar ,",
    "the spectrograph slit was rotated to the appropriate position angle so that a nearby comparison star was observed along with the object .",
    "wide slits ( 4.5@xmath14 at steward , 10@xmath14 at wise ) were used to minimize the effects of atmospheric dispersion at the non - parallactic position angle . the quasar flux is calibrated relative to that of the comparison star .",
    "this technique provides excellent calibration even during poor weather conditions , and accuracies of order 1%  ",
    "2% can easily be achieved .",
    "observations typically consisted of two consecutive exposures of the quasar / star pair .",
    "total exposure times were usually 40 minutes long at steward and 2 hours at wise .",
    "the spectroscopic data were reduced using standard iraf[multiblock footnote omitted ] routines .",
    "the consecutive quasar / star flux ratios were compared to test for systematic errors in the observations .",
    "the ratios almost always reproduced to 0.5 - 1.5% at all wavelengths and observations with ratios larger than 5% were discarded .",
    "for both quasars we examined the best s / n spectra and chose line - free spectral bands suitable for setting the continuum underlying the emission lines and the wavelength limits for integrating the line fluxes .",
    "the spectral regions for h@xmath0 and the continuum bands are given in table  [ param ] .",
    "the line and continuum fluxes were measured automatically for all epochs by calculating the mean flux in the continuum bands and summing the flux above a straight line in @xmath15 connecting the continuum bands straddling the emission line .",
    "figure  [ lc0804 ] shows the continuum measurements ( on the blue side of h@xmath0 ) for pg  0804 + 762 , together with @xmath11-band photometry from paper  i , and the h@xmath0 light curve .",
    "observations of this quasar used different comparison stars at wise and at steward ( see paper  i ) . note the excellent agreement between these completely independent measurements . the continuum variability ( defined as @xmath16 $ ] )",
    "is 40% and the h@xmath0 variability is @xmath918% .",
    "the continuum variability time scale , defined as the width of the continuum auto - correlation function at 0.5 correlation , is 320 days .",
    "the h@xmath0 light curve clearly follows the continuum . it is smoother than the continuum light curve and",
    "does not show the shorter and weaker spikes .",
    "nearly identical behavior and variability are seen in the h@xmath6 light curve ( not shown ) .",
    "figure  [ lc0953 ]  shows the  corresponding  light curves  for pg  0953 + 414 . during the 4-year period , the continuum varied by 35% while the h@xmath0 light curve , which appears to follow the continuum , has a typical amplitude of 13% .",
    "the continuum variability time scale , defined as above , is 200 days .",
    "the h@xmath17 line ( not shown here ) exhibits similar variations to h@xmath0 .",
    "lcc piccf  centroid & 102 & 115 zdcf  centroid & 84 & 107 blr size & 85@xmath127 & 90@xmath144    we have used two methods for correlating the line and continuum light curves . the partly interpolated cross - correlation function ( piccf ) of gaskell & peterson ( 1987 ) and gaskell ( 1994 ) and the @xmath10-transform discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) of alexander ( 1996 ) . the second method , which is an improvement of the discrete correlation function ( dcf ; edelson & krolik 1988 ) , applies fisher s @xmath10 transformation to the correlation coefficients , and uses equal population bins rather than the equal time bins used in the dcf .",
    "the cross correlations of the h@xmath0 and the continuum light curves for the two objects are shown in figure  [ ccf ] .",
    "both cross - correlation methods yield similar results .",
    "the zdcf for pg  0953 + 414 has few points since its light curves contain fewer measurements and the number of bins scales as the square of the number of measurements .",
    "nevertheless , its agreement with the piccf is good and indicates that the interpolation done in the piccf did not introduce an artificial correlation . in both quasars , the h@xmath0 flux lags the continuum by a few months and the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) peak is highly significant .",
    "we list in table  [ peaks ] the centroid of all points above 60% of the peak correlation .",
    "since both correlation methods yield similar centroid results , we adopt the mean lag implied by the two methods as our measure of the blr radius .",
    "we defer to a future paper discussion of various complications involved in associating an observed time - lag with a blr size , e.g. , the dependence of the peak of the ccf on the nature of the continuum variability , the possible non - linear response of the balmer line intensity to the continuum flux variations , or the possibility that the ionizing continuum may behave differently from the observed continuum .    to estimate the uncertainty in the piccf time lags , we have carried out monte - carlo simulations as described in maoz & netzer ( 1989 ) . for each object",
    "the simulation involves a linear interpolation of the observed continuum light curve and the calculation of the expected line light - curve for a chosen blr geometry .",
    "these continuum and line light curves are then repeatedly sampled at random in a seasonal pattern resembling the observing sequence , simulated measurement errors are added , and the piccf and its centroid location are calculated for each simulated pair .",
    "we have tried a variety of spherical geometries and computed , for each , the cross - correlation centroid distribution .",
    "the distribution is approximately gaussian .",
    "the width of the distribution is a measure of the uncertainty in the lag .",
    "the central width that contains 68% of all expected lags is an estimate of the 1@xmath18 error .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath130 days for pg  0804 + 762 and @xmath155 days for pg  0953 + 414 .",
    "these uncertainties are adopted in the discussion below .",
    "spectrophotometric monitoring of pg  0804 + 762 and pg  0953 + 414 have revealed a clear correlation and lag between the continuum and balmer - line light curves .",
    "all seyfert 1 galaxies that have been studied in this way have time - averaged luminosities of 4@xmath1210@xmath19  erg  s@xmath3 at most , while the pg quasars yield measures of the time lag in agn with luminosities exceeding @xmath20  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "we have found that the h@xmath0 emission line lags the continuum by 93@xmath130 days in pg  0804 + 762 and by 111@xmath155 days in pg  0953 + 414 .",
    "since measured agn time lags are an indicator of the characteristic blr size , our results allow us to search for a correlation of the blr size with source luminosity .",
    "when comparing lags , the same emission lines should be used in all objects since different emission lines can have different time lags in a given object ( see , e.g. , peterson 1993 ) .",
    "balmer lines are useful since their lag has been measured in most agn where reverberation mapping has been attempted .",
    "figure  [ rvsl ] compares the blr size of 12 agn , as deduced from cross - correlating the balmer lines with the optical continuum light curves , to their 0.11  @xmath21 m luminosity ( defined in table  [ param ] ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to measurements where a significant correlation of the line and continuum light curves has been detected .",
    "the blr radius , @xmath22 , is the mean of values in the literature for the time lag of a given object , corrected by a @xmath23 factor .",
    "caution must be taken when interpreting the diagram , since each study has used its own method to deduce @xmath22 and its uncertainty .",
    "the error bars on @xmath22 are a combination of the quoted uncertainties in the various references , as well as the spread in values reported in the literature for a given object .",
    "the uncertainty in the luminosity , @xmath24 , is set by the observed variability range . for the seyfert nuclei ( @xmath25 )",
    "alone there is no clear correlation given the narrow luminosity range sampled . adding the results for pg  0804 + 762 and pg  0953 + 414 introduces a possible trend , and indicates that @xmath26 may scale with @xmath27 . under the simple assumptions that the shape of the ionizing continuum in agn is independent of @xmath24 , and that all agn are characterized by the same ionization parameter and blr gas density ( as indicated by the generally - similar observed line ratios ) , @xmath28 is expected .",
    "a line with this slope is shown in figure  [ rvsl ] . while this is not the result of a proper fit to the data , such a trend is consistent with our results .",
    "the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( if one exists ) , yet to be determined from our complete quasar sample , may hold important clues to the nature of these objects .",
    "in particular , using line - profile information , an agn mass - luminosity relation can eventually be derived .",
