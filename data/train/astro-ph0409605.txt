    "pregalactic scenarios for gc formation can explain many puzzling properties of gcs in the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "this is especially true for so - called metal - poor gcs ( with @xmath2\\lesssim -1 $ ] ) , which form a distinctive population in many galaxies .",

    "one very interesting variation of the pregalactic picture is the primordial scenario of gc formation , which was first proposed by @xcite . in its modern interpretation",
    ", the primordial scenario assumes that gcs formed at the center of small dm minihalos in the early universe , before or during the reionization of the universe , which is believed to have ended around the redshift of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the primordial picture has been considered by many authors , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that during the reionization of the universe no star formation can take place inside small dm halos with the virial temperature below @xmath7  k ( or virial mass less than @xmath8  @xmath9 ) , as the gas in such halos should escape the shallow gravitational potential after being heated to @xmath7  k by the metagalactic lyman continuum ( lyc ) background @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite suggested though , that the reionization of the universe can actually trigger star formation in small dm minihalos through different positive feedback mechanisms . in the scenario of @xcite , star formation in small gas - rich minihalos",
    "is triggered by radially converging radiation shock fronts caused by the external lyc radiation field . in the cosmological simulations with radiative transfer of @xcite ,",
    "small - halo objects constitute the bulk of mass in stars until at least redshift @xmath10 because of the increased non - equilibrium fraction of free electrons in front of the cosmological h  ii regions and inside the relic cosmological h  ii regions , which results in more efficient h@xmath11 formation and hence cooling of the gas .    despite the fact that many authors considered different hydrodynamic and radiative processes which can lead to formation of gc - like stellar clusters inside dm minihalos",

    "note that this is the case of no dm ( bare stellar cores ) .",
    "as one can see , there are three different regimes of the initial relaxation phase : 1 ) `` hot '' collapse ( @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) results in a substantial loss of stars which initial velocity was above the escape speed for the system ; only the slowest moving stars collapse to form a bound cluster .",

    "3 ) `` cold '' collapse ( @xmath65 or @xmath66 ) is violent , and leads to increasingly larger fraction of escapers for colder systems . in the last case ,",
    "the nature of unbinding of stars is very different from the `` hot '' case . during a cold collapse",
    ", the radial gravitational potential is wildly fluctuating . at the intermediate stages of the relaxation ,",
    "the central potential of the cluster becomes much deeper than the final , relaxed value . as a result",
    ", a fraction of stars are accelerated to speeds which will exceed the escape speed of the relaxed cluster .",
    "analysis shows that most of escapers are the stars that initially were predominantly in the outskirts of the cluster and moving in the outward direction .",
    "these three regimes of the initial relaxation of proto - gcs are of very general nature , and are not restricted to the gc formation scenario of ms04 . to illustrate that , let us write down an expression for the virial ratio of a homogeneous isothermal sphere , which is applicable to both pre - starburst gas phase of a forming gc , and the initial stellar configuration after the star burst takes place :    @xmath67    here @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the mass and the radius of the system , and @xmath70 is the mean - square speed of either gas molecules or stars . assuming that newly - born stars have the same velocity dispersion as star - forming gas , equation  ( [ nueq ] ) suggests three following physical scenarios resulting in our `` hot '' , `` warm '' , and `` cold '' stellar configurations ( in all scenarios we start with an adiabatically contracting gas cloud of a jeans mass , which corresponds to @xmath71 ) : 1 ) non - efficient stars formation with a subsequent loss of the remaining gas leads to our `` hot '' case , 2 ) almost 100%-efficient star formation results in the `` warm '' case , and 3 ) runaway cooling of the whole cloud on the time scale shorter than the free - fall time , leading to high - efficiency star formation , results in our `` cold '' case .",

    "this makes it an interesting case to test the result of @xcite , that a stellar cluster inside a static constant density dm halo can acquire a radial density cutoff similar to that expected from the action of tidal forces of the host galaxy , for the case of live dm halos with cosmologically relevant density profiles and initially non - equilibrium stellar cores .    in figure  [ rho_w ]",

    "long - dashed lines show the density profiles for stars in the absence of dm ( thin lines ) and dm in the absence of stars ( thick lines ) .",
    "solid lines , on the other hand , show the density profiles for stars and dm having been evolved together",
    ". we also show as dotted lines the stellar radial density profiles for the case of a static dm potential .    as you can see from figure  [ rho_w ] , in the absence of dm ( model w@xmath139 ) , the relaxed stellar cluster has a central flat core and a close to power - law outer density profile .",
    "the radial density profile has also a small `` dent '' outside of the core .",
    "it is not a transient feature ( in the collisionless approximation ) , as the virial ratio for the whole cluster is equal to unity within the measurements errors ( @xmath169 for @xmath170 ) and the evolution time is @xmath171 crossing times even at the very last radial density profile point .",
    "as we show in paper  ii , collisional long - term dynamic evolution of a cluster will remove this feature , bringing the overall appearance of the density profile closer to that of the majority of observed gcs .",
    "the central stellar density in the model w@xmath139 is @xmath172 three orders of magnitude larger than the central density of dm in the undisturbed burkert halo , and becomes comparable to the density of the undisturbed nfw halo only at very small radii @xmath173  pc ( which is outside of the range of radial distances in figure  [ rho_w]a ) .    in the case of a live dm halo coevolving with the stellar core ,",
    "the dm density profile is significantly modified within the central area dominated by stars ( see figure  [ rho_w ] ) . in both nfw and burkert halos ,",
    "dm is adiabatically compressed by the potential of the collapsing stellar cluster to form a steeper slope in the dm radial density profile .",
    "the slope of the innermost part of the dm density profile is @xmath174 for the nfw halo and @xmath175 for the burkert halo .",
    "the lack of resolution does not allow us to check if the slope stays the same closer to the center of the dm halos .    in the outer parts of the dm halos ( beyond the scale radius @xmath39 , which is marked by vertical dotted lines in figure  [ rho_w ] ) , the dm density profile becomes steeper than the original slope of @xmath41 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that our dm halo models are truncated at a finite radius @xmath176 and hence are not in equilibrium .",
    "it should bear no effect on our results , as in all our models stellar clusters do not extend beyond @xmath39 .    as you can see in figure  [ rho_w ] , the impact of the presence of a live dm halo on the stellar density profile is remarkably small ( especially for the burkert halo ) . in the presence of dm ,",
    "the central stellar density becomes somewhat larger ( by @xmath177% and @xmath178% for the nfw and burkert halos , respectively ; see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "the most interesting effect is observed in the outer parts of the stellar density profiles , where the slope of the profiles becomes significantly larger than that of a purely stellar cluster , which is similar to the result of @xcite .",
    "the density profile starts deviating from the profile for the model w@xmath139 somewhere between the radius @xmath179 and the radius @xmath180 ( where the enclosed masses for stars and dm become equal , see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "there is a simple explanation for the steepening of the stellar density profile seen in figure  [ rho_w ] around the radius @xmath180 . in the absence of dm , warm collapse of a homogeneous stellar sphere ( our model w@xmath139 ) is violent enough to eject a number of stars into almost radial orbits , forming a halo of the relaxed cluster . in the case",
    "when the dm halo is present , dynamics does not change much near the center of the cluster where stars are the dominant mass component . around the radius @xmath180 the enclosed dm",
    "mass becomes comparable to that of stars . as a result , gravitational deceleration , experienced by stars ejected beyond @xmath180 , more than doubles , resulting in a significantly smaller number of stars populating the outer stellar halo at @xmath181",
    "this should lead to significantly steeper radial density profile beyond @xmath180 , as observed in our w@xmath147 models .    as in @xcite model , in our model",
    "the steepening of the stellar density profile is caused by the fact that at large radii the gravitational potential is dominated by dm .",
    "the principal difference between the two models is that in @xcite the stellar cluster is assumed to be isothermal and in equilibrium ; our clusters are not in equilibrium initially , and their final equilibrium configuration is not isothermal ( stars are dynamically colder in the outskirts of the cluster ) .    to allow a direct comparison of the model results with observed gcs , in figure  [ proj_w ] we plot both the surface brightness @xmath182 profile ( panel _ a _ ) and the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath167 profile ( panel _ b _ ) for warm collapse models .",
    "the surface brightness @xmath166 in units of mag  arcsec@xmath183 is calculated using the following formula :    @xmath184 . \\label{eqsigma}\\ ] ]    here @xmath185 is the absolute @xmath186-band magnitude of the sun , @xmath187 is the projected surface mass density in units of @xmath9  pc@xmath183 , and @xmath188 is the assumed @xmath186-band mass - to - light ratio for baryons in gcs .",
    "for @xmath188 we adopt the observationally derived averaged value of 1.45 from @xcite , which is also between the two stellar - synthesis model values ( 1.36 for the salpeter and 1.56 for the composite  with a zero slope for stellar masses @xmath189  @xmath9  initial mass functions ) of @xcite .",
    "as you can see in figure  [ proj_w ] , the presence of a dm halo introduces an outer cutoff in the surface brightness radial profile of stellar cluster , which makes the profile look very similar to a king model profile .",
    "interestingly , stellar cluster evolving in a live nfw dm halo acquires even steeper outer density and brightness profiles than for the case of a static dm potential ( see figures  [ rho_w]a and [ proj_w]a ) .",
    "analysis of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles for warm collapse models ( figure  [ proj_w]b ) shows that the presence of a dm halo slightly inflates the value of @xmath167 in the core of the cluster ( by @xmath190% , see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "the outer dispersion profile either stays unchanged ( as in the case of the burkert halo ) , or becomes slightly steeper ( for the nfw model ) .",
    "the static dm models present profiles of an intermediate type .    a slight increase of @xmath167 in the central part of the cluster can be misinterpreted observationally as a gc with no dm which has a bit larger value of the baryonic mass - to - light ratio @xmath191 . to quantify this effect",
    ", we apply a core fitting ( or king s ) method of finding the central value of @xmath191 in spherical stellar systems @xcite :    @xmath192    here @xmath193 is the central surface brightness in physical units . we assume here that @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the projected surface mass density at the center of the model cluster .",
    "the core fitting method assumes that the mass - to - light ratio is independent of radius , which is obviously not true for our stars @xmath1 dm models . in our models",
    "the stellar particles have the same mass , so there is no radial mass segregation between high and low mass stars caused by the long - term dynamic evolution of the cluster . as a result , the equation  ( [ equpsilon ] ) should not be used to compare our models with real gcs .",
    "instead , we use it to check if there is a change in the apparent mass - to - light ratio @xmath191 between our purely stellar models and the models containing dm .",
    "we list the values of @xmath191 for different models in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "as you can see , in the case of nfw halo ( model w@xmath80 ) , the presence of the dm halo leads to @xmath196% increase in the value of the apparent mass - to - light ratio .",
    "such a small increase is well within the observed dispersion of @xmath191 values for galactic gcs @xcite . in the case of the burkert halo ,",
    "the apparent central mass - to - light ratio is only @xmath197% larger than for the purely stellar model .",
    "a principal difference between warm and cold collapse models from ms04 is that in the cold collapse case a significant fraction of stars becomes unbound after the initial relaxation phase ( see figure  [ beta_m ] ) . in our model c@xmath139 with the mass parameter @xmath90 the fraction of the stars lost is 30% .",
    "the radial density profile for c@xmath139 model is similar to that of w@xmath139 model ( see figure  [ rho_c ] ) .",
    "one can intuitively expect the escapers from the model c@xmath139 to be trapped inside our models containing dm , forming a distinctive feature in the outer density and velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "as you can see in figures  [ rho_c ] and [ proj_c ] , our cold collapse models do show such features .",
    "both density and surface brightness profiles become more shallow in the outer parts of the stellar clusters where dm dominates stars .",
    "this is valid for both nfw and burkert halos . for the nfw and burkert cases , the slope of the outer stellar density profile is @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively . for the purely stellar case ( model c@xmath139 ) the slope is @xmath200 ,",
    "so the relative change in the slope is @xmath201 and @xmath202 for the nfw and burkert cases .",
    "this behavior is mimicked by the corresponding surface brightness profiles ( figure  [ proj_c]a ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for the c@xmath80 model the radial @xmath166 profile exhibits a significant steepening of the slope in the outmost parts of the cluster , creating an appearance of a `` tidal cutoff '' ( similarly to the warm collapse cases ) .",
    "even more pronounced are features in the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles ( figure  [ proj_c]b ) . in both nfw and burkert cases , there is a plateau in the radial @xmath167 profiles around the radius @xmath180 where dm becomes the dominant mass component .",
    "the apparent `` break '' in the surface brightness profile and accompanying flattening of the radial @xmath167 profile , seen in our models containing dm , can be misinterpreted observationally as a presence of `` extratidal '' stars heated by the tidal field of the host galaxy .",
    "similarly to warm collapse models , the apparent mass - to - light ratio @xmath191 for cold collapse models in the presence of a live dm halo is very close to the purely stellar case c@xmath139 ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the half - mass radii for warm and cold collapse models with dm are almost identical .",
    "this is consistent with the properties of the observed gcs , which have comparable half - mass radii for a wide range of cluster masses .",
    "dm density profiles for the cold collapse cases ( figure  [ rho_c ] ) exhibit a very similar behavior to the warm collapse models in the stars dominated central region . for both nfw and burkert halos ,",
    "the innermost slopes of the density profiles become steeper ( @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectively ) in the presence of a stellar core .",
    "the nfw dm density profile shows a break around the radius @xmath180 .    as you can see in table  [ tab3 ] and figure  [ rho_c ] , the final stellar cluster half - mass radius is smaller than the dm softening length @xmath205  pc .",
    "we reran models c@xmath80 and c@xmath83 with much smaller value of @xmath206  pc to test the possibility that our results were influenced by the fact that dm is not resolved on the stellar cluster scale . for both c@xmath80 and c@xmath83 ,",
    "the relaxed stellar profiles are found to be virtually identical to the cases with larger @xmath135 . in particular , a `` kink '' seen in figures  [ rho_c]a and [ rho_c]b around the radius @xmath135 is also present at the same location in the simulations with much smaller value of @xmath135 , and is definitely not a numerical artifact . in the case of nfw halo ,",
    "the central stellar velocity dispersion becomes slightly larger , which results in somewhat larger value of @xmath207 .",
    "this could be in part because of artificial mass segregation , which should be more pronounced in the case of @xmath135 being significantly lower than the optimal value ( in our cold collapse models , dm particles are @xmath208 times more massive than stellar particles ) . as a result , the actual @xmath191 value could be even closer to the baryonic value . in the case of burkert halo with @xmath206",
    "pc , the core mass - to - light ratio @xmath209 , which is identical to the case of no dm .",
    "we conclude that our choice of @xmath135 did not affect the main results presented in this section .",
    "it is generally assumed that in an equilibrium star - forming cloud no bound stellar cluster will be formed after stellar winds and supernova explosions expel the remaining gas if the star formation efficiency is less than 50% ( which corresponds to the initial virial parameter for the stellar cluster of @xmath210 ) . in ms04",
    "we showed that it is not true for initially homogeneous stellar clusters which have a maxwellian distribution of stellar velocities .",
    "in such clusters with the initial virial parameter as large as 2.9 ( corresponding to the mass parameter @xmath54 as low as @xmath211 ) , a bound cluster , containing less than 100% of the total mass , is formed by the slowest moving stars . ( a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite for initially polytropic stellar spheres . )    in our model h@xmath139 ( @xmath88 , @xmath212 ) , @xmath213% of all stars stay gravitationally bound after the initial relaxation phase ( see figure  [ beta_m ] ) . because in both cold and hot collapse models for purely stellar clusters a significant fraction of stars become unbound , one might expect that stellar density and velocity dispersion profiles to be similar for these two cases in the presence of dm .",
    "analysis of figures  [ rho_h ] and [ proj_h ] shows that it is definitely not the case : h@xmath147 models show completely different behavior from c@xmath147 models .",
    "the explanation is simple : c@xmath139 model starts with the stellar density which is already larger than the density of dm within the stellar core in models c@xmath147 ( in other words , @xmath96 , see table  [ tab1 ] ) , and after the relaxation phase reaches even higher density which is @xmath214 times higher than the initial density .",
    "the hot collapse model h@xmath139 , on the other hand , having started with @xmath96 , acquires a density which is @xmath215 times lower than the initial density after the expansion and relaxation phase , resulting in @xmath216 for the relaxed stellar cluster even for the burkert halo . under these circumstances , radial profiles for h@xmath80 and h@xmath83 models",
    "should be significantly different from the case with no dm ( h@xmath139 ) , which is what is seen in figures  [ rho_h ] and [ proj_h ] .",
    "the only common feature between the models c@xmath147 and h@xmath147 is that in both cases all would - be escapers are trapped by the potential of the dm halo .    in the case of the nfw halo , central stellar density and central velocity dispersion become larger in the presence of dm by factors of 35 and 3 , respectively . in the burkert halo case ,",
    "the increase is not as dramatic , but still significant : central density and velocity dispersion become 7 and 2 times larger than those in the absence of dm .",
    "interestingly , as in the cold collapse cases , the presence of dm brings the half - mass radius of the stellar core in h@xmath147 models closer to the half - mass radius of the warm collapse models ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "the apparent central mass - to - light ratio @xmath191 is noticeably inflated by the presence of dm ( especially for the case of nfw halo )  by 76% and 36% for nfw and burkert models , respectively .",
    "as you can see in figure  [ rho_h]a , in the model h@xmath80 stars have a comparable density to dm in the core , and become less dense than dm outside of the core radius @xmath217 .",
    "the situation is different ( and more in line with warm and cold collapse models ) for the h@xmath83 model ( figure  [ rho_h]b ) , where stars are the dominant ( though not by a large margin ) mass component in the core .",
    "there are no obvious features in the density and surface brightness profiles caused by the presence of dm : the profiles look very similar to w@xmath139 and c@xmath139 models which do not have dm .    similarly to warm and cold collapse cases ,",
    "the presence of a stellar cluster makes dm denser in the central area . in the case of nfw halo , the innermost slope of the dm density profile is comparable to the slope of @xmath36 for undisturbed halo . for the burkert halo ,",
    "the slope becomes steeper , reaching the value of @xmath218 at the innermost resolved point .",
    "the most interesting behavior is exhibited by the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles ( figure  [ proj_h]b ) . in the presence of dm ,",
    "the profiles become remarkably flat , changing by mere 0.2  0.3  dex over the whole range of radial distances ( out to @xmath219 apparent half - mass radii ) .",
    "the combination of the low mass , low central surface brightness , large apparent mass - to - light ratio , and almost flat velocity dispersion profiles seen in models h@xmath147 can be mistakingly interpreted as a gc observed at the final stage of its disruption by the tidal forces of the host galaxy .",
    "a significant hindrance to a wider acceptance of the primordial scenarios for gc origin is an apparent absence of dm in galactic gcs .",
    "many observational facts have been suggested to be evidence for gcs having no dm , including the presence of such features in the outer parts of the gc density profiles as apparent tidal cutoffs or breaks , relatively low values of the apparent central mass - to - light ratio @xmath191 which are consistent with purely baryonic clusters , flat radial distribution of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the outskirts of gcs believed to be a sign of tidal heating , and non - spherical shape of the clusters in their outer parts .",
    "here we present the results of simulations of stellar clusters relaxing inside live dm minihalos in the early universe ( at @xmath12 ) .",
    "we study three distinctly different cases which can correspond to very different gas - dynamic processes forming a gc : a mild warm collapse , a violent cold collapse resulting in a much denser cluster with a significant fraction of stars escaping the gc in the absence of dm , and a hot collapse resulting in a lower density cluster with many would - be stars - escapers .",
    "we show that gcs forming in dm minihalos exhibit the same properties as one would expect from the action of the tidal field of the host galaxy on a purely stellar cluster : king - like radial density cutoffs ( for the case of a warm collapse ) , and breaks in the outer parts of the density profile accompanied by a plateau in the velocity dispersion profile ( for a cold collapse ) . also , the apparent mass - to - light ratio for our clusters with dm is generally close to the case of a purely stellar cluster .",
    "( the special case of a hot collapse inside a dm halo which produces inflated values of @xmath191 can be mistaken for a cluster being at its last stage of disruption by the tidal forces . )",
    "we argue that increasingly eccentric isodensity contours observed in the outskirts of some gcs could be created by a stellar cluster relaxing inside a triaxial dm minihalo , and not by external tidal fields as it is usually interpreted .",
    "indeed , cosmological dm halos are known to have noticeably non - spherical shapes ; a stellar cluster relaxing inside such a halo would have close to spherical distribution in its denser part where the stars dominate dm , and would exhibit isodensity contours of increasingly larger eccentricity in its outskirts where dm becomes the dominant mass component .",
    "it is also important to remember that few galactic gcs show clear signs of a `` tidal '' cutoff in the outer density profiles @xcite .",
    "the `` tidal '' features of an opposite nature  `` breaks '' in the outer parts of the radial surface brightness profiles in some gcs  are often observed at or below the inferred level of contamination by foreground / background objects , and could be in many cases an artifact of the background subtraction procedure which relies heavily on the assumption that the background objects are smoothly distributed across the field of view .",
    "a good example is that of draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy . @xcite",
    "used simple non - filtered stellar counts from photographic plates followed by a background subtraction procedure to show that this galaxy appears to have a relatively small value of its radial density `` tidal cutoff '' @xmath220  arcmin and a substantial population of `` extratidal '' stars .",
    "@xcite used a more advanced approach of multi - color filtering of draco stars from the sloan digital sky survey images and achieved much higher signal - to - noise ratio than in @xcite .",
    "new , higher quality results were supposed to make the `` extratidal '' features of draco much more visible . instead , @xcite demonstrated that the draco s radial surface brightness profile is very regular down to a very low level ( 0.003 of the central surface brightness ) , and suggested a larger value for the king tidal radius of @xmath221  arcmin .",
    "we argue that the qualitative results presented in this paper are very general , and do not depend much on the the fact that we used ms04 model to set up the initial non - equilibrium stellar core configurations , and on the particular values of the model parameters ( such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath22 ) . as we discussed in section  [ results ] , the appearance of `` tidal '' or `` extratidal '' features in our warm and cold collapse models is caused by two reasons : ( 1 ) at radii @xmath181 the potential is dominated by dm , whereas in the stellar core the potential is dominated by stars from the beginning till the end of simulations , and ( 2 ) the collapse is violent enough to eject a fraction of stars beyond the initial stellar cluster radius .    as we showed in ",
    "[ physical ] , for the initial stellar density @xmath222  @xmath9  pc@xmath16 ( from ms04 ) , the whole physically plausible range of stars - to - dm mass ratios @xmath22 and the gc formation redshifts @xmath31 satisfy the above first condition . for warm and cold collapse",

    ". one can easily estimate @xmath79 for other values of @xmath13 .",
    "the second condition is more difficult to quantify . in ms04",

    "@xcite simulated cold collapse for a wider spectrum of initial cluster configurations , including power - law density profile , clumpy and rotating clusters . in all their simulations",
    "an extended halo is formed after the initial violent relaxation .",
    "it appears that in many ( probably most ) stellar cluster configurations , which are not in detailed equilibrium initially , our second condition can be met .",
    "of course , not every stellar cluster configuration will result in a gc - like object , with a relatively large core and an extended halo , after the initial violent relaxation phase .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a warm ( @xmath225 ) collapse of a homogeneous isothermal sphere produces clusters with large cores ( their models d and g ) .",
    "adiabatic collapse of homogeneous isothermal spheres produces clusters which surface density profiles are very close to those of dynamically young galactic gcs ( ms04 ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that any cold stellar system which does not contain significant inhomogeneities relaxes to a large - core configuration .",
    "the results of @xcite can also be used to estimate the importance of adiabaticity for core formation . indeed , their initially homogeneous models h and g span a large range of @xmath57 , and include both adiabatic cases ( @xmath226 for their number of particles @xmath227 , from eq.[[eqbeta ] ] ) and non - adiabatic ones ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "it appears that all their models ( adiabatic and non - adiabatic ) form a relatively large core .",
    "the issue is still open , but it appears that the adiabaticity requirement ( our eq.[[eqbeta ] ] ) is not a very important one for our problem .",
    "( though this requirement is met automatically for real gcs for the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 derived in ms04 . )",
    "an important point to make is that the simulations presented in this paper describe the collisionless phase of gc formation and evolution , and can not be directly applied to gcs which have experienced significant secular evolution due to encounters between individual stars . in ms04",
    "we showed that such collisionless simulations of purely stellar clusters describe very well the surface brightness profiles of dynamically young galactic gcs ( such as ngc  2419 , ngc  5139 , ic  4499 , arp  2 , and palomar  3  see fig .  1 in ms04 ) .",
    "in paper  ii we will address ( among other things ) the issue of long - term dynamic evolution of hybrid gcs .",
    "we will demonstrate that , at least for the warm - collapse case , secular evolution does not change our qualitative results presented in this paper .    in the light of the results presented in this paper and the above arguments",
    ", we argue that additional observational evidence is required to determine with any degree of confidence if gcs have any dm presently attached to them , or if they are purely stellar systems truncated by the tidal field of the host galaxy .",
    "a decisive evidence would be the presence of obvious tidal tails .",
    "a beautiful example is given by palomar  5 @xcite , where tidal tails were observed to extend over @xmath229 in the sky .    even if a gc cluster is proven not to have a significant amount of dm",
    ", it does not preclude it having been formed originally inside a dm minihalo . in `` semi - consistent '' simulations of @xcite of a dwarf galaxy formation , proto - gcs were observed to form inside dm minihalos , with the dm being lost during the violent relaxation accompanying the formation of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , their simulations did not have enough resolution to clarify the fate of dm in proto - gcs . in paper",

    "it is easy to show that this probability is              so the probability @xmath252 serves as a weight for scalar variables .",
    "for example , to calculate the square of the projected three - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath261 , corresponding to the projected distances range @xmath256 , one has to set @xmath262 in equation  ( [ eqq ] ) , where @xmath263 are the velocity components of the @xmath248-th particle .",
    "observationally , one can determine @xmath261 by measuring both line - of - sight velocities and two proper motion components for stars located within the interval @xmath256 of projected radial distances .",
    "one can show that the above method is superior to a straightforward projection onto one plane or three orthogonal planes by considering a contribution made by one particle to the bin @xmath256 . in case of the straightforward projection",
    ", there is a high probability that the particle will make no contribution to the projection bin . in our method ,",
    "every particle with @xmath264 will make a contribution to the bin , which will make the radial profile of the projected quantity significantly less noisy .",
    "central value of the projected quantity is obtained by setting @xmath253 to zero in equations  ( [ w_i])([eqq ] ) . in this case , all particles make contribution to the averaged value of the quantity .",
    "the situation with vector quantities is a bit more complicated .",
    "we designed a simplified procedure which is based on the assumption that the bin sizes are small ( so the number of bins is large ) .",
    "each particle with an associated vector quantity ( say , velocity vector ) is first rotated around the @xmath265 axis to bring the particle in the plane @xmath266 .",
    "next , the particle is rotated around the axis @xmath267 to make the projected radial distance of the particle equal to the radial distance of the center of the bin @xmath268 .",
    "( the observer is assumed to be at the end of the axis @xmath265 . )",
    "the detailed procedure is as follows . for a particle with",
    "coordinates @xmath269 , after the two rotations the associated vector @xmath270 is transformed into vector @xmath271 with the following components :            if vector @xmath270 is velocity vector , then substituting @xmath285 in place of @xmath286 in equation  ( [ eqq ] ) will give us the value of the square of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath167 , averaged over all possible rotations of the cluster , for the bin @xmath256 .",
    "similarly , replacing @xmath286 with @xmath287 and @xmath288 will produce the averaged values of the square of the radial and tangential components of the proper motion dispersion , respectively .",
