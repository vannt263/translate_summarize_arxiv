    "the production of high-@xmath0 partons ( observed as high-@xmath0 hadrons or jets ) involves a `` hard '' perturbative scale @xmath1 .",
    "this report mainly considers the case when this scale is harder than any momentum scale characterizing the medium produced in the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "momentum scales proposed to characterize the medium ( such as the initial temperature @xmath2 or the saturation momentum @xmath3 ) may be perturbatively large themselves , in which case @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this restriction aims at insuring that _ hard _ partonic production processes are not part of the `` bulk matter '' : they occur in the primary partonic collisions on temporal and spatial scales @xmath6 , @xmath7 which are sufficiently small to be unaffected by the properties of the produced matter .",
    "this makes them promising candidates of processes whose primary partonic production process is unaffected by the presence of a medium , while the development of the final ( and possibly initial ) state parton shower leaving ( entering ) the hard partonic subprocess is sensitive to the medium .",
    "if collinear factorization is applicable in nucleus - nucleus collisions , then inclusive cross sections of high-@xmath0 partons measured in proton - proton collisions or calculated in perturbative qcd can be used as benchmark against which one can search for the actual signals and properties of the hot and dense matter created in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc .",
    "* section  [ sec2 ] * discusses benchmark calculations for jet spectra and identified high-@xmath0 hadronic spectra in nucleus - nucleus collisions at lhc , calculated in the framework of collinear factorized qcd .",
    "the question to what extent collinear factorization can be expected to hold in nucleus - nucleus collisions , and how its validity can be tested experimentally , is discussed in chapter @xcite of this workshop report .",

    "the centrality dependence is not studied in either contribution .",
    "the words of caution about our results which were given in the pa section are even more relevant in ab collisions , as our ignorance on soft multiparticle production in this case is even larger than in pa collisions .",
    "for example , the number of particles produced at midrapidity in a central pbpb collision at the lhc may vary as much as a factor 3 @xcite among different models which , in principle , are able to reproduce the available experimental data on multiplicities at sps , rhic and tevatron .",
    "therefore , these issues of the underlying event @xcite and multiple hard parton scattering @xcite demand extensive monte carlo studies including full detector simulation . preliminary analysis , based on the developed sliding window - type jet finding algorithm ( which subtracts the large background from the underlying event ) and full geant - based simulation of the cms calorimetry , shows that even in the worst case of central pbpb collisions with maximal estimated charged particle density at mid - rapidity @xmath28 , jets can be reconstructed with almost 100  % efficiency , low noise and satisfactory energy and spatial resolution starting from @xmath29 gev ( see the section on jet detection at cms ) . in the case of",

    "the initial jet distributions in the nucleon - nucleon sub - collisions at @xmath65 tev were generated using pythia 6.1  @xcite , as described before .",
    "this dijet event is then superimposed on the pb - pb event , obtained using a hydrodynamical model of the hadron spectrum  @xcite as a superposition of thermal hadron distributions and collective flow .",
    "the average hadron transverse momentum , @xmath66 gev/@xmath67 , was fixed in the model .",
    "the analysis was done for two estimates of the charged particle multiplicity at @xmath68 in central collisions , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the calorimeter occupancy is high enough in these cases : mean energy per tower is about @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) gev for @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) in the barrel part , and it increases by a factor @xmath75 in endcaps .",
    "[ cmsjet : fig2 ] shows the correlation between reconstructed and generated transverse energies of jets in pb@xmath76pb and @xmath77 events .",
    "the generated jet cone has a radius @xmath78 while the radius of the reconstructed cone is larger , @xmath79 .",
    "since the average measured jet energy in pb@xmath76pb collisions is the same as in @xmath77 , the @xmath77 interactions are a baseline for jet physics in heavy ion collisions . however , the jet transverse energy resolution is degraded by a factor @xmath75 in the high multiplicity central pb@xmath76pb collisions compared to @xmath77 interactions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cmsjet : fig3 ] .",
    "the jet energy resolution is defined here as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the reconstructed transverse energy , and @xmath82 is the transverse energy of all generated particles inside the given cone radius @xmath83 .",
    "the resolution of @xmath84 gev jets with @xmath85 is smaller than for @xmath86 gev jets ( as well as the resolution of 50 gev jets with @xmath87 is smaller than for 75 gev jets ) since the background is not fully subtracted and , as a result , the reconstructed jet energy is larger in pb@xmath76pb than @xmath77 .",
    "we can define the purity of jet reconstruction as the number of events with a true qcd jet divided by the number of events with reconstructed jets .",
    "then , for example , the purity is @xmath88 for @xmath89 gev jets for @xmath85 , because the average energy of the false jets in the background events is also @xmath44 gev .",

    "table 7 summarizes the purity , contamination levels ( false jets /generated jets ) and jet transverse energy resolution in central pb@xmath76pb collisions with @xmath87 and @xmath70 .",
    "since the azimuthal angle and rapidity distribution of jets are of particular interest for jet quenching observables , the angular resolution is important .",
    "figures  [ cmsjet : fig4 ] and  [ cmsjet : fig5 ] show the differences in azimuthal angle @xmath91 between generated and reconstructed @xmath86 gev jets in events without and with pb@xmath76pb background . even in the most pessimistic case , @xmath85",
    ", the @xmath91 resolution is degraded only by a factor of @xmath92 in pb@xmath76pb compared to @xmath77 collisions .",
    "the resolution is still less than the azimuthal size of a calorimeter tower , @xmath93 .",
    "a similar result is also found for the @xmath94 resolution ( shown in figs .",
    "[ cmsjet : fig4 - 1 ] and  [ cmsjet : fig5 - 1 ] ) , which is however somewhat worse than the @xmath91 resolution .",
    "the reason for that is the vertex was not fixed here and there was not correction of @xmath94 due to fluctuation of @xmath95 coordinate in `` pile up '' subtraction algorithm ( the latest version of the algorithm included this facility ) .",
    "figures  [ cmsjet : phi - et ] and  [ cmsjet : eta - et ] shows the energy dependence of the spatial resolution for pp and pb@xmath76pb events with @xmath87 and @xmath70 .",
    "thus the spatial position of a hard jet can be reconstructed in heavy ion collisions at cms with high enough accuracy for analysis of jet production as a function of azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity .",
    "the level 1 single jet and electron / photon trigger rates in pb@xmath76pb collisions have been estimated using the trigger algorithms developed for @xmath77 collisions with a parameterization of hijing results for the background  @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution to the trigger rate comes from the single jet trigger which uses the transverse energy sums ( electromagnetic + hadronic ) computed in the calorimeter regions ( @xmath96 trigger cells ) @xmath97 . for a threshold of 40@xmath7650",
    "gev it gives an acceptable output rate of about 400@xmath76200 hz and is fully efficient for most central collisions .",
    "assuming that with the high level trigger full jet reconstruction is possible , the rate can be further reduced to a level lower than 10 hz for jets with reconstructed transverse energies greater than @xmath86 gev .",
    "the rate of the single photon trigger is less than 1 hz for a threshold of 50 gev .",
    "with such a threshold , the trigger efficiency is close to @xmath98 for @xmath99jet events useful for off - line analysis .",
    "track finding in heavy ion collisions is difficult due to the large number of tracks in an event .",
    "we consider heavy ion multiplicities up to the worst case , @xmath70 charged particles per unit rapidity in a central pb@xmath76pb event .",
    "in addition to the primary tracks , the cms tracker is occupied by secondaries produced by interactions with the detector material .",
    "the cms track reconstruction algorithm , originally developed for @xmath77 collisions , is based on kalman filtering and includes seed generation , track propagation , trajectory updating and smoothing .",
    "however , this track finder , optimized for the highest efficiency at low density , fails when dealing with central pb@xmath76pb events due to the large hit combinatorics .",
    "therefore , modification of the algorithm is necessary  @xcite .",
    "the essential difference for heavy ion collisions is that the primary vertex can be determined with dispersion of @xmath100 @xmath38 m using only two barrel layers before any tracking .",
    "using this constraint reduces the combinatorial background during track seeding .",
    "thus these two features , primary vertex finding and restriction of the vertex region , were added to the standard package .    in order to achieve good rejection power to fake tracks from random hit combinations",
    "we need to require the track to have as many hits as possible .",
    "only tracks that leave the tracker through the outermost layer are considered .",
    "this requirement leads to a minimum transverse momentum cutoff of @xmath101 gev for the track to be considered reconstructable .",
    "given this constraint the modified @xmath77 reconstruction algorithm gives about @xmath102 geometrical acceptance and close to @xmath103 algorithmic reconstruction efficiency in a low multiplicity environment .",
    "the acceptance varies slightly @xmath104 over the @xmath94-coverage of the tracker and is independent of @xmath105    we have tested track propagation algorithms for the case of high occupancy using monte carlo tracks seeds .",
    "the estimated efficiency under these conditions appears high enough , @xmath102 .",
    "the momentum resolution is less than @xmath106 at @xmath107 gev .",
    "thus track propagation at high density is quite effective .",
    "the reconstruction time is around @xmath108 s / per event .",
    "we have also investigated using a regional track reconstruction in a limited @xmath109 area .",
    "this option is essentially needed for jet finding and correcting .",
    "the efficiency is very high , @xmath110 , but we see a large number of fake tracks .    thus we believe that pattern recognition is possible in heavy ion collisions with the cms tracking system . the existing @xmath77 track reconstruction package has been shown to be a valuable framework , but needs major restructuring to reduce combinatorics and computation time .",
    "it is important to study hard jet and high-@xmath0 hadron production in heavy ion collisions as a function of centrality . in cms ,",
    "the best way to determine the impact parameter , @xmath33 , event - by - event is the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeters , @xmath111 , which strongly decreases from central to peripheral collisions  @xcite .",
    "the jet production rates , @xmath112 , can be measured in bins of @xmath111 .",
    "then the @xmath113 and @xmath114 dependencies of @xmath112 can be related by the @xmath115 correlation functions @xmath116 , @xmath117    since",

    "the overall performance of the calorimeter system is described in [ 1 ] .",
    "the muon spectrometer in atlas is located behind the calorimeters , thus shielded from hadronic showers .",
    "the spectrometer is implemented using several technologies for tracking devices and a toroidal magnet system , which provides a field of 4  t strength to have an independent momentum measurement outside the calorimeter volume .",
    "most of the volume is covered by mdts , ( monitored drift tubes ) .",
    "the forward region where the rate is high , cathode strip chamber technology is chosen .",
    "the stand - alone muon spectrometer momentum resolution is of the order of @xmath160 for muons with @xmath0 in the range 10 - 100 gev .",
    "the muon spectrometer coverage is @xmath161 .",
    "the trigger and data acquisition system of atlas is a multi - level system , which has to reduce the beam crossing rate of 40  mhz to an output rate to mass storage of @xmath162  hz .",
    "the first stage ( lvl1 ) is a hardware based trigger , which makes use of coarse granularity calorimeter data and dedicated muon trigger chambers only , to reduce the output rate to about 75  khz , within a maximum latency of 2.5  @xmath38s .",
    "the performance results mentioned have been obtained using a detailed full simulation of the atlas detector response with geant and have been validated by an extensive program of testbeam measurements of all components .      the atlas calorimer coverage and",
    "its fine segmentation will be an asset for jet studies in the heavy ion environment .",
    "signatures of jet quenching in central heavy ion collisions could manifest as a larger jet cone ( as compared to proton - proton collision ) and/or modifications in the jet fragmentation function .",
    "the finely segmented ( longitudinally and transversely ) electromagnetic calorimeter will allow us to reconstruct em clusters in the jet environment and in particular measure the @xmath163 containt in the jet .",
    "there is excellent opportunity in atlas to measure @xmath164 , jet - jet and z - jet events where one can more fully characterize the modified fragmentation functions .",
    "in particular , the @xmath165(or z ) in @xmath166 processes provides a `` control '' over the away - side jet energy and direction that will allow the physics of quenching to be studied quantitatively and in great detail @xcite .",
    "the effects of hard gluon radiation on the photon / jet energy imbalance and angular distribution can be studied in great detail using the high - statistics p - p data set .",
    "the @xmath164 channel requires the identification of a photon . in proton - proton collisions",
    "the rejection of @xmath167 is about a factor of three up to a @xmath0 of 50 gev .",
    "however , the heavy ion environment presents considerable more challenge .",
    "@xmath168 production rates have been estimated by wang and huang @xcite .",
    "for @xmath0 larger than 40 gev , we expect of the order of @xmath9500 @xmath169 events for one month - run .",
    "therefore multiple runs may be required to extract relevant information on jet fragmentation .",
    "the atlas calorimeter granularity is shown in table 1 .",
    "the calorimeter system is not only segmented in @xmath94 and @xmath25 , but also longitudinally .",
    "the calorimeter is fully segmented to @xmath170 .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter is in most places @xmath171 deep and designed to fully contain a 1 tev electron or photon .",
    "the hadronic calorimeter is more than @xmath172 deep and contains all of the hadrons in typical pp high luminosity runs .",
    "table 1 : atlas calorimeter system segmentation . listed",
    "are the number of longitudinal and the size of the transverse segmentation in the different calorimeters .",
    "0.2 cm    l|c|c|l calorimeter system & @xmath94 coverage & long . &",

    "these numbers are expect to be different for the heavy ion environment .",
    "preliminary simulations indicate that the detection thresholds should be at around 40@xmath950 gev .",
    "we expect a worsening of the energy resolution because of the soft background but the energy scale should remain untouched , unless the ratio of em to hadronic components in the jet changes substantially .",
    "preliminary figures for energy deposition in the em calorimeter from full hijing central events indicate that approximately 4 gev of transverse energy is deposited in a tower @xmath187 .",
    "this number is consistent with reported by cms .",
    "however , due to the longitudinal segmentation and predominantly low @xmath0 ( @xmath188)nature of the particles in the background , we do expect that most of the energy to be deposited in the first compartament of the calorimeter .",
    "thus jets could be reconstructed on the basis of the remaining compartaments .",
    "detailed studies are under way .",
    "to study jet quenching in a direct way is to measure its fragmentation function and possible changes in the jet cone radius .",
    "the fragmentation function can only be measured if particles are identified within the jet .",
    "the segmentation of the atlas calorimeter is such that allows , in principle , for the identification of @xmath189 s . in spite of the soft background preliminary studies",
    "shows encouraging results .",
    "however , we have observed a significant worsening of the em cluster energy resolution .",
    "studies performed in proton - proton collisions do have not addressed the issue of em cluster reconstruction , specially for @xmath163s at low energy .",
