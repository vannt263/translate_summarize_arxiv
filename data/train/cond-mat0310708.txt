    "interacting electrons in two dimensions form a collective quantum fluid  @xcite under the application of an intense magnetic field that exhibits the remarkable phenomenon of the fractional quantum hall effect(fqhe ) .",

    "the composite - fermion ( cf ) theory  @xcite applies to a broader range of phenomena , while also providing a new interpretation for the physics of the @xmath0 state , as a state of composite fermions at an effective filling of @xmath2 . while the wave function for the @xmath0 ground state from the cf theory is the same as that in ref .  , the wave functions for the excitations are different , which gives an opportunity to test the validity of the cf theory at @xmath0 itself .",
    "we note that when speaking of  quasiparticles \" in this paper , we really will mean  quasiparticle excitations \" of an incompressible fqhe state . in a broader sense , the quasiparticles ,",
    "namely the objects that are weakly interacting , are known to be composite fermions ; many properties of the fqhe state and various related phenomena can be understood in terms of almost free composite fermions .",

    "our present study finds qualitative differences as well as substantial quantitative deviations between the two approaches .",
    "we will concentrate below on @xmath3 , and begin , for completeness , with one quasiparticle in the disc geometry .",
