    "recently , a great interest has been generated in noncommutative spacetimes @xcite , mainly due to the fact that there are of strong motivations in the development of string and m - theories @xcite .",
    "a different approach to noncommutativity is through the introduction of noncommutative fields @xcite , that is , fields of their conjugate momenta are taken as noncommuting .",
    "there are several approaches in considering the notion of noncommutativity in cosmology , that could be the best alternative in the absence of a comprehensive and satisfactory theory from string theory .",
    "this analysis has been studied in many works @xcite . here",
    ", taking coordinates as noncommuting , it has been shown that noncommutativity affects the spectrum of cosmic microwave background .",
    "for example , in @xcite , noncommutative geometry suggest a non local inflaton field that changes the gaussianity and isotropy property of fluctuations . in cosmological systems , since the scale factors , matter fields and their conjugate momenta play the role of dynamical variables of the system , introduction of noncommutativity by adopting the noncommutativity between all fields , is particularly relevant .",
    "the simplest noncommutative classical and quantum cosmology of such models have been studied in different works @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is a renewed interest on noncommutative theories to explain the appropriate modification of classical general relativity , and hence of spacetime symmetries at short - distance scales , that implies modifications at large scales .",
    "general quantum mechanics arguments indicate that , it is not possible to measure a classical background spacetime at the planck scale , due to the effects of gravitational backreaction @xcite .",
    "it is therefore tempting to incorporate the dynamical features of spacetime at deeper kinematical level using the standard techniques of noncommutative classical field theory based in the so called moyal product in which for all calculations purposes ( differentiation , integration , etc . )",
    "the space time coordinates are treated as ordinary ( commutative ) variables and noncommutativity enters into play in the way in which fields are multiplied @xcite . using a modified symplectic structure on the space variables in the hamilton approach , as we are trying with the idea of noncommutative space time , we propose that the minisuperspace variables do not commute , for that purpose we will modified the poisson structure , this approach does not modify the hamiltonian structure in the noncommutative fields . in the approach",
    "used , we choose that the momentas in both spaces , are the same , @xmath4 , it is say , they commute in both spaces .",
    "another way to extract useful dynamical information is through the wkb semiclassical approximation to the quantum wheeler - dewitt equation using the wave function @xmath5 . in this sense , we consider the usual approximation in the derivatives and the corresponding relation between the einstein - hamilton - jacobi ( ehj ) equation , it was possible to obtain classical solutions at the master equation found by this procedures .",
    "the classical field equations were checked for all solutions , using the reduce 3.8 algebraic packages .",
    "the main idea in this paper is to obtain both , the commutative @xmath6 and noncommutative @xmath7 classical solution of the einstein field equation in general relativity for the bianchi class a models , without solve these field equations , using two alternative approaches , known as wkb semiclassical approximation and hamilton approach . using these solutions in the gauge n=1 ( the physical gauge ) , we can inffer if the anysotropic parameters @xmath8 suffers changes toward isotropic ones ( a constant or zero value ) .",
    "this analysis is considered in particular with the bianchi type i , coupled to barotropic perfect fluid and cosmological term . in this case",
    ", we can observe that when the cosmological constant decrease in its value , the isotropization is more notorious for a larger period time .",
    "the paper is then organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we obtain the wdw equation including the barotropic matter contribution , and the corresponding commutative classical solutions for the cosmological bianchi type i , in the gauge @xmath9 , by the wkb semiclassical approximation and hamilton procedure .",
    "section iii is devoted to the noncommutative classical solutions and the analysis of the isotropization is made too , in the physical gauge n=1 .",
    "final remarks are presented in section iv . for completeness",
    ", we can follow a similar prescription for the gauge @xmath10 , where the noncommutative cosmological model is always anisotropic .",
    "so , we present the corresponding solutions for both scenarios , the commutative , appendix a and noncommutative , appendix b.    let us begin by recalling canonical formulation of the adm formalism to the diagonal bianchi class a cosmological models .",
    "the metrics have the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the lapse and shift functions , respectively , @xmath14 is a scalar and @xmath15 a 3x3 diagonal matrix , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are one - forms that characterize each cosmological bianchi type model , and that obey @xmath18 @xmath19 the structure constants of the corresponding invariance group @xcite .",
    "the metric for the bianchi type i , takes the form @xmath20 the corresponding lagrangian density is @xmath21 and using ( [ bi ] ) , this have the following form @xmath22.\\ ] ] where the overdot denotes time derivatives .",
    "the canonical momentas to coordinate fields are defined in the usual way @xmath23 and the correspondent hamiltonian function is @xmath24=0 , \\label{hami1}\\ ] ] together with barotropic state equation @xmath25 , the hamilton - jacobi equation is obtained when we substitute @xmath26 into ( [ hami1 ] ) . in what follows , we should consider the gauge @xmath9 .",
    "the quantum wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation for these models is obtained by making the canonical quantization @xmath27 by @xmath28 in ( [ hami1 ] ) with @xmath29 is @xmath30\\psi=0 .",
    "\\label{wdw1}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we now proceed to apply the wkb semiclassical approximation using the ansatz @xmath33},\\ ] ] into ( [ wdw1 ] ) , and without any loss of generality , one can consider the condition @xmath34 be small i.e. , @xmath35 to get the classical einstein - hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath36 which can be separate in a set of differential equations @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the separation constants and their relations is @xmath41 . therefore using the relations between ( [ p- ] ) , ( [ omega ] ) , ( [ + ] ) and ( [ - ] ) we have the following equations of motion @xmath42 the main master equation to solved in the gauge @xmath43 ,",
    "is @xmath44 the other two equations ( [ + + ] ) and ( [  ] ) are trivially integrable . for particular stadium of the universe evolution , given by the @xmath45 parameter , we present these classical solutions in table [ tabc1 ] .",
