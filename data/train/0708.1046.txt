    "* trentham et al . ( 2001 ) ) , which relies on searching for signs of non - motivated distortion visible on images of spatially isolated galaxies .",
    "as known , galaxies in close encounters show a significant signature of interaction in the form of a distortion of their structure , the presence of tails and bridges , or a common diffuse envelope .",
    "all these features have been quantitatively explained based on numerous n - body simulations ever since ( * ? ? ?",
    "* toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) ) .",
    "signs of interaction are seen in more than 50% of those binary galaxies where the separation is comparable to the sum of the diameters . in systems with greater separation , as in triplets ,",
    "the relative number of peculiar galaxies is about 30% . in magnitude - limited galaxy catalogs ,",
    "the fraction of interacting objects is equal to 8% ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* karachentsev,binary galaxies  , 1987 ) ) .    when considering more and more scattered systems of galaxies and single galaxies of the `` general field ''",
    ", one can expect a fraction of the interacting objects among them to be nearby zero .",
    "this would occur if there were no other objects except the luminous galaxies .",
    "however , if completely dark galaxies with masses of @xmath0 exist , the phenomena of interaction will occur in the case of extremely isolated galaxies too .",
    "hence , an asymptotic relative number of peculiar shapes among the most spatially isolated galaxies may be a sensitive tool for estimating the cosmic abundance of massive dark galaxies .",
    "to search for such strange cases of interaction where the second interacting companion is invisible , we used the `` catalog of isolated galaxies '' ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* karachentseva 1973 ) = kig ) .",
    "this catalog contains 1050 galaxies without `` significant '' neighbors .    according to our estimates",
    ", the catalog objects do not suffer essential perturbations from neighboring galaxies over some gyrs . as it is a sample of northern galaxies with @xmath2 ,",
    "the catalog includes only 4% of the cgcg galaxies from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zwicky et al . ( 1961 - 1968 ) ) ; hence kig is a collection of a rather rare kind of galaxies .",
    "all kig galaxies were inspected by us on the digital sky survey in some cases , we also studied galaxy images in the 2mass to check for the possibility of double - nuclei systems as recent merging remnants .",
    "the results of our inspections ( ) karach06 yield five disturbed / lopsided galaxies .    then , we undertook a new search for isolated distorted galaxies in a sample limited by radial velocities @xmath3 km s@xmath4 . among 7500 such galaxies of the local supercluster ,",
    "about 60% reside in groups of different populations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* makarov & karachentsev , 2000 ) ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath5 galaxies are characterized by different degrees of isolation with respect to their neighbors .",
    "we selected 500 of the most isolated galaxies and inspected their images on dss .",
    "only 4 galaxies out of 500 show significant signs of interaction .",
    "one case , ugc  4722 , turns out to be common with the kig sample .",
    "signs of interaction between galaxies are best developed when the objects have similar masses .",
    "if the number of completely dark sub - halos with typical masses of @xmath0 in any volume approximately corresponds to the number of luminous galaxies , then one may expect about 8% interacting galaxies among the isolated ones ( interaction with an invisible object ) .",
    "this rough estimate ignores , of course , properties of spatial distribution of dark sub - haloes with respect to the luminous galaxies .",
    "the observed relative number of kig galaxies with clear features of interaction , 5/1050 = 0.5% , turns out to be one order of magnitude lower than expected .",
    "the observed frequency of disturbed shapes among very isolated galaxies in the local supercluster , 4/500 = 0.8% , is consistent with the previous estimate made for the kig sample . in view of these results , it is rather unlikely that the number of massive dark sub - halos is similar to the number of the usual galaxies .",
    "moreover , apart from interaction with a dark galaxy , the observed morphological irregularities of isolated galaxies may different origins , in particular , there could have been a merger , with the companion now merged and not visible anymore , or there could be large gas accretion from cosmic filaments , leading to perturbed morphologies via star bursts .    as noted by trentham",
    ", dark galaxies probably have low masses and negligible dynamical effects on massive galaxies like the ones in the kig sample .",
    "they can have much more substantial effects on the nearby low - mass galaxies seen , say , in the catalog of neighboring galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* karachentsev et al . 2004 ) ) .",
    "this sample contains 197 quite isolated galaxies with a `` tidal index '' @xmath6 .",
    "( a negative @xmath7 means that the keplerian cyclic period of the galaxy with respect to its main neighboring disturber exceeds the cosmic hubble time . )",

    "if ddo  68 is a single such object in the local volume , it yields a fraction of disturbed isolated galaxies , 1/197 = 0.5% , the same as for the kig catalog .",
    "spectral observations were performed by us for some faint galaxies around each of the eight peculiar objects . no physical companions to the considered peculiar galaxies were found , confirming their high isolation .",
    "the peculiar galaxies were imaged in @xmath10 bands , and in the emission @xmath11 line .",
