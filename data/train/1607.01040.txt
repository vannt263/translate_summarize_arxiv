    "moment invariants have aroused great interest in image processing and pattern recognition in the last 50 years @xcite.the first kind of moment invariants was presented by hu @xcite in pattern recognition . since then , the applications have been reported in a variety of problems , such as image watermark @xcite , gesture recognition @xcite , noise analysis @xcite and color image @xcite .",
    "invariance with respect to translation , rotation and scaling is required in almost all practical applications , because the article should be correctly acquainted , regardless of its position and orientation in the site and of the object - to - camera distance .",
    "furthermore , the translation , rotation and scaling model is a ample approximation of the actual image deformation if the location is flat and almost vertical to the optical axis .",
    "therefore , much attention has been paid to translation , rotation and scaling invariants . while translation and scaling invariants can be derived in a instinctive way , derivation of invariants to rotation",
    "is far more complicated .",
    "the moment @xmath0 of a weighting kernel @xmath1 and the intensity function @xmath2 is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath0 @xmath4 are the projections of @xmath2 onto the space spanned by @xmath5 .",
    "moments @xmath0 can be grossly divided into non - orthogonal moments and orthogonal moments @xcite .",
    "the classical non - orthogonal moments include geometric moments , rotational moments and complex moments .",
    "the geometric moments are projections of the image onto the space spanned by monomials , i.e. , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the complex moments have the similar structure as geometric moments except for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the rotational moments are defined directly in polar coordinates , i.e. , @xmath8 @xcite .    from the theory of algebraic invariants",
    ", the non - orthogonal basis will lead to the information redundancy @xcite . in order to overcome the shortcomings of this problem , teague @xcite introduced the orthogonal moments by orthogonal polynomials in 1980 .",
    "some popular orthogonal moments are legendre and zernike moments @xcite .",
    "legendre moments @xcite in cartesian coordinate are generated by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the @xmath11th order of legendre polynomial .",
    "the finite energy signal @xmath12 can be reconstructed by its legendre moments @xcite . while zernike moments @xcite were generated by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the @xmath11th order zernike radial polynomial .",
    "other kinds of continuous orthogonal moments have the similar structure and properties as the above moments , such as pseude - zernike moments @xcite , chebyshev - fourier moments @xcite , exponent - fourier moments@xcite .",
    "there are some discrete orthogonal moments in the literature , such as tchebichef , dual hahn , racah moments and so on , which can be effectively solved a lots of physical problems @xcite .",
    "the paper proposes a novel kind of moments on a disk .",
    "they are constructed as products of a radial factor ( slepian functions ) and angular factor ( harmonic function ) .",
    "we named it as slepian - based moments ( sms ) and used sms to construct rotation invariants .",
    "slepian functions are a set of functions derived by timelimiting and lowpassing , and a second timelimited operation , as originally proposed for time series by slepian and coworkers , in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "they possess many remarkable properties , such as orthogonal basis of both square integrable space of finite interval and the paley - wiener space of bandlimited functions on the real line @xcite .",
    "they are the most energy concentrated functions , among the set of bandlimited functions with a given bandwidth , on fixed space domain @xcite .",
    "since the energy concentrated property on fixed space domain , the slepian basis has good performance in local approximation compared to other approximation basis , such as fourier basis and polynomials @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of whether they yield decent performance in image processing .",
    "the aim of the article is to answer this question by applying the slepian functions as the kernel @xmath1 of moment @xmath0 . to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "the study of moment invariants under the slepian functions has not been carried out . in the present study",
    "we construct the sms and derive the rotational invariants .",
    "we show that the numerical computation of sms is @xmath15 and apply these new invariants in facial expression classification .",
    "our experiments demonstrate that the rotational invariants are robust to image noise and have good recognition capabilities in facial expression classification .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : s2 ] is devoted to necessary preliminaries . in section [ sec : s3 ] the rotation invariants are derived by the proposed slepian - based moments . in section [ sec : s4 ] , the extended conh - kanade database ( ck@xmath16 ) @xcite is used to test the rotation invariance and the robustness of the proposed variants to noise .",
    "the proposed sms invariants are also applied as features to facial expression classification .",
    "finally , we draw a conclusion in section [ sec : s5 ] .",

    "moment @xmath22 of an image @xmath2 in polar coordinates is defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 are non - negative integers , @xmath25 is the order of @xmath22 and @xmath26 means the complex conjugate operation .",

    "we will change the radial part to a special function i.e. , slepian functions .",
    "the moments we defined by this functions is called slepian - based moments .",
    "now we first introduce the slepian functions in continuous form and discrete form .",

    "the slepian functions have been proved as the most energy concentrated functions , among the set of bandlimited functions with a given bandwidth , on fixed space domain @xcite .",

    "this raises the question of whether they yield decent performance in image processing .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in developing numerical methods using slepian functions as basis functions .",
    "the discrete slepian functions are developed by slepian at first @xcite , which is also called the discrete prolate spheroidal sequences ( dpss ) . for given @xmath56 the number of length of the sequences and @xmath57 the bandwidth of the sequences , the dpss @xmath58 is defined as the solution to the system of equations @xmath59 where @xmath60",
