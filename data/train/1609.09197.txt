    "current and future observations aiming at understanding the nature of cosmic acceleration offer the unique possibility of testing predictions of general relativity ( gr ) on scales well beyond those of the solar system , where gr has received its most impressive confirmations .",
    "upcoming galactic surveys such as des @xcite , euclid @xcite , desi @xcite , lsst @xcite , wfirst @xcite and ska @xcite are expected to provide unprecedented datasets with which to investigate , in an accurate way , how structures form and grow , and how light rays bend in the presence of local gravitational potentials .",
    "anticipating interesting signals of non - standard gravity that could be potentially detected by such future surveys of the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe is a crucial task .",
    "any deviation from the standard @xmath10cdm paradigm will imply some anomalous relation among the curvature perturbation @xmath14 , the newtonian potential @xmath15 and the comoving density contrast of non relativistic matter @xmath16 .",
    "these effects can be encoded in time and scale modifications to the effective newton s constant parameter @xmath0 and to the gravitational slip parameter @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the former quantity describes how fluctuations of the matter fields interact in the universe , while the latter encapsulates non - standard relation between the newtonian potential @xmath15 ( time - time part of the metric fluctuations ) and the curvature potential @xmath14 ( space - space part ) . from @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 one can derive a further parameter , @xmath2 , of more direct relevance for lensing surveys  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 relates the matter over - density with the lensing ( or weyl ) potential @xmath18 .",
    "another convenient quantity to describe the gravitational clustering of matter is the product of the linear growth factor @xmath19 and the @xmath20 density fluctuations on a scale of @xmath21 mpc ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this quantity , which can be optimally estimated from the analysis of the redshift space distortions induced by the large - scale , coherent , in - falling(/out - flowing ) of matter into(/out of ) high(/low ) density regions , is another key quantity turning galaxy redshift surveys into gravity probes .",
    "while any observed deviation would represent a major discovery in itself , it is important to understand what type of signals are implied by concrete alternatives to the standard model and interpret them in terms of fundamental theoretical proposals .",
    "in particular , theories containing one extra scalar degree of freedom and leading to equations of motion of at most second order_horndeski theories _  @xcite  despite the freedom in the choice of their free functions and the richness of their potential phenomenology , have proven to share common features and universal behaviours .",
    "the exclusion of pathologies and instabilities imposes tight constraints and well defined patterns for the time scaling of relevant observables of the lss in the universe  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was pointed out in  @xcite that the linear growth rate of horndeski theories is systematically lower , at low redshift , than the value predicted by the standard @xmath10cdm model . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that brans - dicke theories , clustering and interacting dark energy models follow characteristic paths in the @xmath23 - @xmath2 plane .",
    "it has also been argued  @xcite that horndeski theories are expected to display a systematic sign agreement in the @xmath23 - @xmath2 plane across all cosmic epochs .",
    "investigating the existence of further general patterns displayed by lss observables is the main goal of the present work . to this purpose , we present a complete study of the horndeski phenomenology that generalizes in many respects that presented in  @xcite .",
    "first of all , we explore accelerating cosmologies in which the presence of dark energy is not confined to the late times  @xcite . at first sight , this is counter intuitive , as the acceleration is a recent phenomenon and there is no need to invoke dark energy effects at early times .",
    "truth is that , although such effects are not needed , not to say wanted , they are allowed within the context of horndeski theories , therefore they must be thoroughly investigated and systematised . in particular",
    ", we find convenient to highlight three possibilities of increasing generality .    *",
    "_ late - time dark energy _ * ( lde ) * :  this is the reference class of models ( explored at length in  @xcite ) , in which both the dark energy momentum tensor and the possible modifications of gravity ( _ i.e. _ the non - minimal gravitational couplings ) become negligible at early times . * _ early dark energy _ * ( ede ) * :  in these scenarios dark energy can contribute to the total energy momentum tensor even at early times , while non - minimal gravitational couplings are kept as a late - time phenomenon . * _ early modified gravity _ * ( emg ) * :   horndeski theories in their full generality .",
    "not only does dark energy always contribute to the total energy momentum tensor , but modified gravity effects are also persistent at early times , during matter domination .    on top of singling out the specific phenomenological features of the horndeski sub - classes listed above , in this work we extend the analysis of  @xcite by including different background expansion histories than the @xmath10cdm model .",
    "beside an effective equation of state parameter @xmath24 ( roughly , the value preferred by current observations , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , we also consider models with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in",
    "@xcite it was found that viability priors do impose tight constraints and well defined patterns for the time scaling of relevant observables of the lss in the universe . as such , viability criteria can be effectively used to complement data and observational information in statistical inferences  @xcite .",
    "testing the consequences of relaxing some of these restrictions is also a goal of the present study .",
    "the main results of the paper are recapped in figure  [ fig_diag ] as exclusion regions in the parameter space of lss observables . in the @xmath0-@xmath2 plane",
    "we highlight regions where the eventual presence of data would rule out the entire class of horndeski theories .",
    "on the other hand , specific regions in the @xmath27-@xmath2 allow to rule out specific subclasses of models ( lde and/or ede ) presented above .",

    "we have now the instruments to define the three different general types of behaviour for dark energy at early times :    * _ late - time dark energy _ * ( lde ) * :  this is the minimal model , in which all effects of dark energy are confined to late times .",
    "not only do non minimal couplings ( @xmath63 ) go to zero at early times  which in the case of the coupling @xmath43 implies @xmath64 going to a constant  but also the dark energy density @xmath60 becomes a sub - dominant component for @xmath65 .",
    "in other words , the energy density of non relativistic particles @xmath61 must saturate the friedmann equations at early time . by comparing   and   this means that @xmath66 . in summary , @xmath67 + the above defined class of models generalises the set explored by @xcite .",

    "our study is oblivious of the radiation dominated epoch . therefore",

    "we thus restrict to the cases when @xmath76 .",
    "note that recent observational bounds  @xcite constraining the amount of dark energy at early times do not apply here , because the eft of de allows us to explore modified gravity models which modify only the perturbed sector of the standard @xmath10cdm model without changing its background history .",

    "@xcite can be trusted .",
    "the latter allows one to neglect time derivatives of scalar and metric fluctuations over spatial derivatives .",
    "moreover , in our framework , the extra scalar degree of freedom has the purpose of sourcing cosmic acceleration thus its mass must be of order hubble or lighter .",

    "the latter , although not entering the expressions of the relevant observables , controls the effectiveness of the no - ghost stability condition and thus generally relaxes the selection processes .",

    "this extremely constrained functional behaviour was already noticed by @xcite and confirmed by  @xcite , although for a more restricted class of horndeski models .",
    "the subset of models displaying @xmath118 in the interval @xmath117 , despite having small size relative to the entire set of simulated models , has not strictly zero measure as was previously found in @xcite .",

    "our current study reveals that switching on @xmath112 is the necessary condition for lde models to exhibit @xmath120 in a stable way and therefore a subset of theories with @xmath118 at intermediate redshifts , @xmath108 stronger gravity and also deeper gravity potentials than the standard model .",
    "since under these conditions light should bend more on average , it does not come as a surprise that models exhibiting @xmath118 in @xmath121 $ ] also display @xmath122 , @xmath108 @xmath123 , or @xmath124 , as the inspection of the second and third row of figure  [ fig_lde ] shows .",
    "the bounded evolution history of @xmath0 has major implications for the growth of structures , as captured by the @xmath3 observable .",

    "the remarkable tightness of the growth rate evolution of @xmath131 also deserves a comment . despite @xmath0 , @xmath17 and @xmath2 spanning , especially at low redshift , a large range of values , absolute deviations of @xmath3 from the @xmath10cdm prediction are never larger than @xmath132 at all cosmic epochs investigated . the remarkably low theoretical dispersion , or equivalently , the poor sensitivity of @xmath3 to the variation of the horndeski couplings , is not however prejudicial , from the observational side , for the purposes of model identification .",

    "this issue is investigated in the next section .      the classification scheme proposed in sec .",
    "[ edeclass ] contains the possibility that dark energy is present at early times , either in the energy momentum tensor ( ede ) or also as early modified gravity ( emg ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_ede_emg ] shows that the presence of modifications of gr at early times alters the values of lss observables even in the local universe .",
    "irrespectively of the specific scenario , viability conditions favour theories with @xmath0 smaller than 1 for @xmath138 . despite we are now allowing initial values of @xmath75 different than @xmath144 , the tendency of having @xmath145 is surviving . on the other hand ,",
    "the emg scenario is the only possibility to produce a small subset of models with @xmath146 at early times .",
    "this can be understood by expressing the effective gravitational constant as @xmath147 ^ 2 } { m^2(1+\\epsilon_4)^2 } \\",
    "\\left[1+\\frac{1+\\epsilon_4}{b } \\left(\\dfrac{\\mu_1 -\\mu_3}{1+\\epsilon_4}-(\\mu_1 + \\mathring{\\epsilon } _ 4 ) \\right)^2\\right].\\ ] ] from stability requirements , @xmath148 and @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) , @xmath108 respectively no gradient instabilities of scalar and tensor modes , the quantity contained in the squared brackets above is greater than or equal to 1 .",
    "therefore , allowing non vanishing @xmath36 and @xmath35 at @xmath151 pushes up the value of @xmath0 at early times .",
    "the above expression also shows that the value of @xmath0 at the present time , @xmath152 , is always greater than or equal to 1 whatever the de scenario .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath0 at early times affects the @xmath3 observable at late epochs .",
    "for instance , the amplitude of @xmath3 predicted in ede scenarios is lower than the standard @xmath10cdm value for @xmath138 , as opposed to lde , for which models systematically flip over @xmath10cdm at @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , over almost all the most interesting epochs of the universe , the @xmath10cdm growth history appears as an extremum not only among the whole class of lde models , but also when ede scenarios are considered .",
    "intriguingly , only ede models manage to strongly suppress the amplitude of the linear growth function at present time . on the opposite ,",
    "the only models allowing for a faster growth than @xmath10cdm ( with @xmath3 more than @xmath154 higher ) , are the emg scenarios .",
    "this is not surprising for , as we said , it is the only set - up for which @xmath118 at early times .",
    "the asymptotic value of the gravitational slip parameter @xmath17 at @xmath151 is , by definition , 1 when the coupling functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 vanish .",
    "therefore , only very mild differences arise between lde and ede at early times . on the contrary",
    ", the redshift dependence of @xmath17 is significantly affected in the emg case , since @xmath35 and @xmath36 are different from zero at all cosmic epochs .",
    "as far as the evolution of @xmath2 is concerned , the amplitude calculated in lde and ede scenarios is always lower than @xmath10cdm for @xmath11 .",
    "once more , the standard model appears as an extremal model .",
    "emg is the only mechanism to allow @xmath155 also at high redshifts .",
    "the marked positive correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 for @xmath11 persists in ede models .",
    "in fact , since @xmath156 a clear @xmath157 correlation should be seen as long as @xmath17 is close to unity .",
    "this is well seen in the cases for lde and ede scenarios at high redshifts as opposed to the emg scenario which displays slightly more dispersion , for it exhibits larger @xmath17 . assuming a non - standard gravitational signal will be detected by future surveys",
    ", we can thus tentatively conclude from comparing figs .",
    "[ fig_lde ] and  [ fig_ede_emg ] that the horndeski class of models will definitely be ruled out as a modified gravity candidate if @xmath0 and @xmath2 have different sign for @xmath11 .",
    "the same conclusion holds if future estimates should eventually converge on a local ( @xmath139 ) value of the effective newton constant lower than 1 .",
    "we stress that finding @xmath136 and @xmath137 of opposite signs at any redshift would not rule out all horndeski models . for instance",
    ", the fact that @xmath1 displays the larger set of values around present time , the relation   induces the models to spread on either side of the @xmath158 line and @xmath13 in the @xmath0@xmath2 plane . as a matter of fact ,",
    "in the emg case for @xmath139 we observe a ratio of @xmath159 models on the left quadrant and @xmath160 on the right . nevertheless , a clear correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 in various interesting higher redshift intervals is definitely confirmed by our analysis ( see also figure 6 in @xcite ) . therefore , we find that the @xmath0@xmath2 plane can be used as a discriminant only in a limited redshift range ( @xmath153 ) and upon imposing our viability conditions .",
    "we refer to figure  [ fig_viab ] below to display how the ",
    "opposite signs \" statement is progressively weakened by the relaxation of some of our conditions .",
    "these aspects are also highlighted in figure 7 of @xcite , where cmb data likelihood is plotted for the observables @xmath0 and @xmath2 calculated at @xmath139 . in much the same way as the plane @xmath0@xmath2 provides a diagnostic for the whole class of horndeski models , the plane @xmath3@xmath2 allows us to tell apart horndeski dark energy sub - classes .",
    "for example , if @xmath161 at @xmath11 , then ede scenarios are ruled out .",
    "similarly , lde is not viable if both @xmath3 and @xmath2 have smaller amplitude than predicted by @xmath10cdm for @xmath11 .",
    "identical conclusions follow from the analysis of the amplitude of the @xmath89 observable alone .",
    "figure  [ fig_sigom ] shows the present - day linear extrapolation of the @xmath20 fluctuations of the matter density field , which we assume to be normalized by the planck measurements at last scattering .",
    "predictions closely reproduce the @xmath10cdm limit in all the lde models",
    ". however , a local measurement of @xmath89 showing large deviations from the @xmath10cdm extrapolation will be instrumental for disentangling ede from emg scenarios .",

    "indeed , complementing an analysis on the growth of structures with lensing observables increases substantially the discriminating power between models .",
    "the next issue we tackle concerns the generality and robustness of our findings against changes in the specific settings and/or assumptions adopted in the analysis . we first explore whether our diagnostic predictions still stand out so clearly once some viability conditions about propagations speeds are relaxed . then , we gauge the effects of considering non - standard evolution of the background expansion rate . finally , we discuss additional checks on the generality of our results and the parametrisation of horndeski theories .",

[ fig_lde ] and figure  [ fig_ede_emg ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "the amplification effect is effectively compensated by the wide variations of the couplings and by the large volume in the theory space that we are considering , even in the @xmath181 case . in summary",
    ", we do not find distinctive definite features of lss phenomenology related to stable violations of the null energy condition .      to assess the generality of our results we have conducted two consistency checks . from the analysis undertaken in this paper and in  @xcite",
    ", the @xmath10cdm paradigm stands out as an extremal model among eft models .",
    "however , one could wonder whether our randomly generated coefficients within a uniform distribution could end up favouring models that are very far from the standard paradigm .",
    "however , we have checked that the correlations we find are unchanged even if the coefficients are picked from gaussian distributions centred around 0 ( the @xmath10cdm value ) and with a standard deviation of 1 .    as a second check",
    ", we have noted that our diagnostic is also unchanged under using a different parametrisations of the couplings .",
    "in particular we have considered an alternative choice of the coupling functions , the so called `` @xmath182-parametrisation '' first proposed by  @xcite and extended by  @xcite , as opposed to the `` @xmath0-parametrisation '' presented in this paper .",
    "appendix  [ alpha ] contains a dictionary to switch between the two parametrisations .",
    "what horndeski theories have to say about early dark energy ? this is the original question motivating the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "early modifications of gr are found to have non - negligible , lasting and potentially detectable effects in the lss observables of the local and recent universe .    in figure  [ fig_diag ]",
    "we summarize our main findings . by tracing the time evolution , from early epochs ( @xmath183 ) down to present day , of fundamental lss observables such as the reduced effective newton constant @xmath0 , the gravitational slip parameter @xmath1 , the lensing parameter @xmath2 and the linear growth function of lss @xmath3 we have found that gr extensions contemplating an additional scalar degree of freedom with second order equations of motion can be definitely ruled out if one of the following conditions apply ( figure  [ fig_diag ] , left panel ) :    * the observables @xmath0 and @xmath2 have opposite sign for @xmath11 * @xmath184 at @xmath139    specific sub - classes of such theories in which the modified gravity effects are limited to late times could be discriminated if data at redshift @xmath11 eventually become available for both redshift and lensing surveys .",
    "indeed , we find that above that critical redshift ( figure  [ fig_diag ] , right panel ) :    * lde will be ruled out if @xmath185 at @xmath11 * ede will be ruled out if @xmath161 at @xmath11 or @xmath161 and @xmath13 at @xmath11    these results are insensitive to the background dark energy @xmath176 parameter within the reasonable range @xmath186 $ ] .",
    "indeed , we have found the diagnostic tool does not lose predictability when progressively less constraining requirements are imposed .",
    "two complementary strategies allow to estimate the likelihood of data given the horndeski class of theories .",
    "a model - dependent analysis is optimal if one is to exploit theoretical priors about the physical viability of specific horndeski models to complement the discriminatory power of data .",
    "indeed , @xcite have shown that by this approach the region of the parameter space that is not rejected by observations is significantly reduced .",
    "an orthogonal approach consists in implementing model - independent likelihood analysis , parametrising lss observables in a purely phenomenological way , blindly of any gravitational theory .",
    "the diagnostics developed in this paper are meant to facilitate theoretical interpretation in these cases .",
    "interestingly , model - independent analyses have been pursued for example in  @xcite and more recently in  @xcite and preliminary results are suggestive of a negative value of @xmath136 at redshift z = 0 .",
    "should future , higher precision data strengthen the statistical significance of these findings , the horndeski landscape would face hard times . exploring beyond standard gr , and notably the functional space of scalar - field extension of gr will eventually become less disorienting than previously suspected .",
    "however , much must still be accomplished and a number of improvements would be desirable .",
    "we have focused on scales much smaller than the hubble radius in this paper . as data improve on ever larger scales , our analysis should be extended to include possible scale dependent effects coming from mass terms of the scalar field that are of the order of hubble .",
    "lastly , it would be useful to study to which level our diagnostic plots are stable to the inclusions of more general scenarios in which the scalar field is allowed to satisfy larger than second order equation of motions ( the so called beyond horndeski theories @xcite , see also  @xcite for an early attempt ) .",
