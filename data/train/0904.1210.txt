    "more recently , these atoms have returned to an ionized state .",
    "although the mechanism by which this second transition took place is not yet well understood , its is commonly suggested that the first astrophysical objects to produce significant fluxes of ultraviolet light ( the minimum frequency required to ionize hydrogen ) , quasars and/or early stars , may have reionized the universe between approximately @xmath3 ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether either quasars or the first stars were capable of producing enough radiation to fully reionize the universe .",
    "previous studies  @xcite have found that , unless the luminosity function of quasars favored more dim ( and thus unobserved ) quasars at high redshifts than in the present epoch , too few quasars would have been present at high redshifts to reionize the universe alone . while it is plausible that radiation from early stars may have lead to this transition  @xcite , the limited empirical information available regarding these objects make it difficult to draw concrete conclusions regarding their role in reionization .",
    "another possible source of ionizing radiation at high redshifts is the annihilation  @xcite or decay  @xcite of dark matter particles . here",
    ", we revisit this possibility , focusing on the case of annihilating dark matter particles with masses at or near the electroweak scale ( @xmath450 - 1000 gev ) .",
    "we include in our calculation the evolution of the halo mass function and the effects of gas heating .",
    "we also include the impact of gamma rays produced through the inverse compton scattering of energetic electrons with the cosmic microwave background .",
    "these inverse compton photons are especially important for reionization , as they have considerably larger cross sections with electrons ( compared to photons of higher energy ) , which enable them to transfer approximately @xmath5 times more energy into the ionization and heating of gas than prompt gamma rays from dark matter annihilations .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , we find that electroweak scale dark matter particles can naturally play the dominant role in the reionization of the universe .",
    "although a dark matter particle with a @xmath4100 gev mass and a typical thermal cross section ( @xmath6 @xmath7/s ) , will only lead to only approximately 1 - 10% of the observed ionization , a non - thermally produced dark matter candidate , such as a 100 - 200 gev wino for example , could easily provide a rate of ionizations consistent with observations ( without large contributions from quasars or early stars ) .",
    "recent observations from the cosmic ray experiments pamela  @xcite and atic  @xcite have been interpreted as possible indications of dark matter annihilations taking place in the galactic halo  @xcite . to accomplish this , however , the halo dark matter must annihilate largely to charged leptons , and with a higher annihilation rate than would be naively predicted for a thermal relic .",
    "if one interprets the pamela and/or atic signals as the products of dark matter annihilation , this leads us to consider dark matter candidates which are naturally expected to fully reionize the universe by @xmath1 without significant contributions from astrophysical sources .",
    "in this section , we calculate the fraction of baryons that are ionized by the products of dark matter annihilations .",

    "a 1 mev ( 10 mev ) photon , for example , loses on average 44% ( 68% ) of its energy in such a collision .",
    "the remaining lower energy photon , however , will be reasonably likely to scatter again , depositing still more of its energy into ionization and heating .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that all of the photon s energy is ultimately transfered in these scatterings .",
    "in the case of a dark matter particle with an electroweak scale mass ( @xmath450 - 1000 gev ) , the majority of the energy in gamma rays is carried away by photons with @xmath4100 mev or more energy each .",
    "a photon with an energy of 1 gev has a cross section with electrons of only @xmath73 @xmath74 , however , which leads to a @xmath40.03% chance of scattering per billion years ( at @xmath75 ) .",
    "highly energetic photons are very inefficient ionizers of gas .",
    "in addition to gamma rays , however , dark matter annihilations can also produce high energy electrons .",
    "such electrons transfer their energy to low energy photons through inverse compton scattering at a rate of @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the energy density of radiation and @xmath78 is the thompson cross section . by scattering off of photons in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , an electron will lose energy at a rate of @xmath79 as a result of this process , a 1 gev electron at redshift @xmath80 will lose 99% of its energy to the cmb in approximately 50 million years ( and 99.9% of its energy in 500 million years ) . at higher redshifts",
    ", the transfer of energy is even more rapid .",
    "thus the vast majority of the energy that is deposited via dark matter annihilations into electrons gets almost immediately transfered into lower energy photons .    an inverse compton scattering between an energetic electron and a cmb photon results in a photon with an average energy of @xmath81 as the klein - nishina cross section is more than two orders of magnitude larger at the typical energies of these inverse compton photons ( @xmath4@xmath82gev ) than at the energies of prompt photons ( @xmath4gev ) , we conclude that electrons from dark matter annihilations provide us with a far more efficient mechanism for reionizing the universe .",

    "<S> energetic electrons produced in these annihilations can scatter with the cosmic microwave background to generate relatively low energy gamma rays , which ionize and heat gas far more efficiently than higher energy prompt photons . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous studies , we find that viable dark matter candidates with electroweak scale masses can naturally provide the dominant contribution to the reionization of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , we find that dark matter candidates capable of producing the recent cosmic ray excesses observed by pamela and/or atic are also predicted to lead to the full reionization of the universe by @xmath1 . </S>"
