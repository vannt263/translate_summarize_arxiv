    "together with vega , fomalhaut ( @xmath7 psa ) , and @xmath1 pictoris , the nearby ( distance to the earth @xmath8 ) low - mass ( @xmath9 ) k2v main - sequence ( ms ) star @xmath0 eridani constitutes the `` big - four '' family of prototypical `` vega - excess '' stars , which are ms stars with infrared ( ir ) radiation in excess of what is expected from their stellar photospheres ( gillett 1986 ) . the ir excess associated with `` vega - excess '' stars is generally attributed to the thermal emission of dust grains orbiting the central star in the form of a disk or ring and heated by its stellar radiation .",
    "the dust is thought to be `` second generational '' in nature rather than `` primordial '' ; i.e. , the dust is considered as _ debris _ generated by collisions of larger objects such as cometary and/or asteroidal bodies rather than",
    "_ remnants _ left over from the star formation process ( backman & paresce 1993 ; lagrange , backman , & artymowicz 2000 ; zuckerman 2001 ) .    in recent years , @xmath6 has received much attention since it is thought to be analogous to the solar system at an age about 1020% of that of the sun : ( 1 ) in comparison with the other three `` big - four '' prototypes which all are much more luminous a - type stars , @xmath6 is _ closer _ in type , mass , and luminosity ( @xmath10 ; soderblom & dppen 1989 ) to the sun ( see greaves & holland 2000 ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath6 has a ring - like structure of @xmath455@xmath11 in radius ( which is very similar to the kuiper belt in size ) and a central cavity inside @xmath430@xmath11 ( which is equivalent in scale to neptune s orbit ) as revealed by its 850@xmath5 image obtained using the scuba ( _ submillimetre common - user bolometer array _ ) camera at the _ james clerk maxwell telescope _ ( jcmt ; greaves et al .",

    "1996 ) `` big - four '' vega - type star , the formation of planets in its disk may have completed since planet formation is thought to be complete by about 10 to 100@xmath13 ( lissauer 1993 ) ; ( 4 ) a roughly jupiter - mass planet with a period of @xmath46.9@xmath14 appears to be present inside the central cleared region of the @xmath6 disk , as suggested by the radial velocity measurements spanning the years 1980.82000.0 ( hatzes et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "to better understand the origin and evolution of protoplanetary dust disks and the formation process of planetary systems , we need to know the physical , chemical , and dynamical properties of their constituent grains . in previous papers ( li & greenberg 1998 , li & lunine 2003a , b )",
    ", we have shown that a simple porous dust model is successful in reproducing the spectral energy distributions from the near - ir to millimeter wavelengths of the disks around the herbig ae / be stars @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the vega - type star @xmath1 pictoris , including the 9.7@xmath5 amorphous and the 11.3@xmath5 crystalline silicate features or the 7.7@xmath5 and 11.3@xmath5 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features . in this _",
    "letter _ we will study the dust ir to submillimeter emission of the disk around the more evolved star @xmath6 .",
    "the objectives of this _ letter _ are four - fold : ( 1 ) we wish to infer the physical and chemical properties of the dust in the @xmath6 disk and to infer the disk structure ; ( 2 ) we wish to gain insights into the evolution of dust mass , size , morphology , and mineralogy at different stellar ages ; ( 3 ) we wish to know how widely applicable is the porous dust model ; if it can be shown that the porous dust model is `` universally '' valid for disks at different evolutionary stages and with different geometrical structures , it will be a valuable guide for interpreting future data sets obtained by the upcoming _ space infrared telescope facility _",
    "( sirtf ) ; ( 4 ) we wish to make mid - ir spectral , imaging and broadband photometry predictions for the @xmath6 disk ; these predictions can be compared to future sirtf observations in order to test further the validity of the porous dust model .",
    "we have discussed in detail in li & greenberg ( 1998 ) and li & lunine ( 2003a , b ) that the dust in protoplanetary disks most likely consists of porous aggregates of protostellar materials of interstellar origin , although there is no consensus regarding the degree to which the original interstellar materials have been processed in protostellar nebulae . unless there are ir signatures ( e.g. the 11.3@xmath5 crystalline silicate feature ) suggestive of the thermal history of the dust available , it is difficult to determine the composition of the dust as a priori .",
    "therefore , in modeling the ir emission of dust disks we usually invoke two extreme dust types : `` _ cold - coagulation _ ''",
    "dust made of coagulated but otherwise unaltered protostellar interstellar grains , and `` _ hot - nebula _ '' dust made of grains that are highly - processed in protostellar nebulae where silicate dust is annealed and carbon dust is destroyed by oxidization ( see li & lunine 2003a , b for details ) . since the @xmath6 disk is too cold to emit at the mineralogical `` fingerprinting '' mid - ir features ( e.g. the 9.7 and 11.3@xmath5 silicate bands and the 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath5 pah bands ) , we will just adopt the `` cold - coagulation '' dust model .",
    "it has been shown in li & lunine ( 2003a , b ) that the major differences between the ir emission from these two dust models lie in their mid - ir spectral features , while their continuum emission are very similar .    for the dust properties ,",
    "we take the porosity ( or fluffiness ; the fractional volume of vacuum in a grain ) to be @xmath15 for 3 reasons : ( i ) dust models with @xmath16 are successful in modeling the ir emission from the disks around @xmath2 ( li & lunine 2003a ) , @xmath3 ( li & lunine 2003b ) , and @xmath1 pictoris ( li & greenberg 1998 ) ; ( ii ) a porosity in the range of @xmath17 is expected for dust aggregates formed through coagulation as demonstrated both theoretically ( cameron & schneck 1965 ) and experimentally ( blum , schrpler , & kozasa 2003 ) ; ( iii ) a porosity of @xmath16 for the `` cold - coagulation '' dust is consistent with the mean mass density of cometary nuclei for which the ice - coated `` cold - coagulation '' dust aggregates are plausible building blocks ( see greenberg & li 1999 ) .",
    "we assume a power - law dust size distribution @xmath18 which is characterized by a lower - cutoff @xmath19 , upper - cutoff @xmath20 and power - law index @xmath7 ; we take @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( see li & lunine 2003a , b ) .",
    "is defined as the radius of the sphere encompassing the entire aggregate . the choice of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as extensively discussed in li & lunine ( 2003a , b ) for the disks around @xmath2 and @xmath3 , will not affect our conclusion . ]",
    "as far as the dust composition is concerned , we take the `` cold - coagulation '' dust model  the dust is assumed to be composed of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous materials ( and h@xmath23o - dominated ices in regions colder than @xmath4110120@xmath24 ) ; the mixing mass ratios for the silicate , carbon and ice constituent grains are approximately derived in li & lunine ( 2003a ) , by assuming cosmic abundance , to be @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are respectively the total mass of the silicate , carbon , and ice subgrains .    guided by the 850@xmath5 scuba / jcmt image and the 850@xmath5 flux radial profile ( see figs.1,2 of greaves et al .",
    "1998 ) , we will adopt a gaussian functional formula for the dust spatial surface density distribution @xmath30 $ ] which describes the dust ring peaking at @xmath455@xmath11 from the star .",
    "the extent of the @xmath6 disk is cut off at an inner boundary of @xmath31 where small grains are heated to temperatures @xmath32 , and an outer boundary of @xmath33 outside of which there is little dust emission .",
    "we use mie theory together with the bruggman effective medium theory ( krgel 2003 ) to calculate the absorption cross sections of the fluffy heterogeneous dust aggregates .",
    "dielectric functions are taken from draine & lee ( 1984 ) for amorphous silicate dust ; li & greenberg ( 1997 ) for carbonaceous dust ; and li & greenberg ( 1998 ) for h@xmath23o - dominated `` dirty '' ice .",
    "the @xmath6 stellar radiation is approximated by the kurucz ( 1979 ) model atmosphere spectrum for k2v stars with an effective temperature of @xmath34 , a surface gravity of @xmath35@xmath36=4.0 , and a solar metallicity @xmath37 .",
    "the calculated dust ir emission spectrum is compared with the iras flux at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100@xmath5 and the scuba flux at 450 and 850@xmath5 ( see table 1 in greaves et al .",
    "there also exist 1300@xmath5 photometric measurements for the @xmath6 disk ( e.g. , chini , krgel , & kreysa 1990 , chini et al .",
    "1991 ) , but we will not include these data since these measurements were all made using single - element bolometers with telescope beams smaller than the disk extent so that the flux obtained by these measurements may be underestimated ( zuckerman & becklin 1993 , weintraub & stein 1994 ) .",
    "the model has four free parameters : @xmath7  the dust size distribution power - law exponent , @xmath38  the disk radial location where the dust spatial distribution peaks ; @xmath39  the fwhm of the dust spatial distribution ; @xmath40  the mid - plane surface density at @xmath41 .",
    "observational constraints include the observed ir spectral energy distribution and the scuba 850@xmath5 image .",
    "the latter is particularly important for constraining the spatial distribution of the dust in the @xmath6 disk . instead of using the smoothed 850@xmath5 image presented in greaves et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we constructed an unsmoothed 850@xmath5 image from all 19972000 data in the scuba archive using the data reduction procedure outlined in bendo et al .",
    "however , both the image and the radial profile obtained from our analysis show an overall good agreement with those of greaves et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",

    "this model gives @xmath53 .",
    "the apparent rise in flux density within @xmath54@xmath55@xmath56 ( @xmath415@xmath11 ) was also seen in the smoothed scuba 850@xmath5 radial profile of greaves et al .",
    "( 1998 ; see their fig.2 ) .",
    "this rise may be associated with the `` _ small peak @xmath57@xmath58 south of star _ '' seen in the scuba 850@xmath5 image ( see fig.1 of greaves et al .",
    "if this is real , we then need to resort to an additional dust component lying close to the star .",
    "this inner warm component would resemble the zodiacal dust cloud in our solar system .",
    "however , the scuba images are quite noisy in the inner region , so the anomalous emission inside @xmath59 may be instrumental noise or image processing artifacts .",
    "we therefore exclude this `` inner component '' emission in our model .",
    "we have seen in  [ sec : results ] that the very same porous dust model shown to be successful in modeling the ir emission from the dust disks around the herbig ae / be stars @xmath2 ( li & lunine 2003a ) and @xmath3 ( li & lunine 2003b ) and the young ms star @xmath1 pictoris ( li & greenberg 1998 ) is also successful in reproducing the ir to submillimeter sed as well as the 850@xmath5 flux density radial profile of the more evolved ms star @xmath6 ( @xmath4@xmath60 old ) , although the model appears unable to provide sufficient 850@xmath5 emission inside @xmath428@xmath11 ( see fig.[fig : sed]b ) .",
    "it is very likely that this inner component emission is not real ( see  [ sec : results ] ) ; but if one really wants to push us to account for this emission , we find that it could be explained by invoking an inner `` zodiacal '' dust cloud of @xmath4@xmath61 mass located at @xmath42@xmath11 from the star .",
    "sirtf will be capable of sensitive imaging using the _ infrared array camera _",
    "( irac ) at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath5 , and using the _ multiband imaging photometer _",
    "( mips ) at 24 , 70 , and 160@xmath5 .",
    "sirtf will also be able to perform low - resolution 540@xmath5 and high - resolution 1037@xmath5 spectroscopic observations using the _ infrared spectrograph _ ( irs ) instrument .",
    "however , the dust in the @xmath6 disk seems to be too cold to emit in an appreciable quantity in the irac bands ( see fig.[fig : sed]a ) .",
    "neither can this dust be heated sufficiently to emit at the characteristic mid - ir spectral features .",
    "but the mips imaging will provide powerful constraints on the @xmath6 dust spatial distribution .",
    "we have therefore calculated the mips 24 , 70 , and 160@xmath5 flux density radial distributions for the best - fit porous dust model ( see fig.[fig : sed]c ) .",

    "but the poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag would remove grains smaller than @xmath4270@xmath5 at @xmath63 in a timescale ( @xmath64 ) shorter than the age of the @xmath6 system ( see fig.[fig : rppr]b ) .",

    "therefore , the observed grains need to be continuously replenished , very likely from cascade collisions and evaporation of larger bodies such as comets and/or asteroids .    the inner `` zodiacal '' cloud , _ if it indeed exists _ , could be maintained by grains released from the sublimation of bombarding comets near the star.20@xmath24 ) occurring inside @xmath54@xmath71110@xmath11 does generate dust outflow . but",

    "( 1995 ) from the observed co upper limit assuming sublimating comets as a co replenishment source in the @xmath6 disk.@xmath75 per orbit ( lisse 2002 ) , we would expect a comet infall rate @xmath4300 times more frequent .",
    "this is much higher than what is observed ( @xmath42030 comets per year ) for the present solar system .",

    "the number of _ observed _ cometary bodies ( crossing the line of sight ) is @xmath4300400 per year ( beust & morbidelli 1996 ) ; however , the actual number would be much higher since many objects do not cross the line of sight and are therefore not visible in spectroscopy . ]",

    "but it is unlikely for grain - grain collisions to effectively remove the dust from the disk ; instead , their major role is to re - distribute the dust over different size bins through fragmentation .",
    "the partially cleared central cavity is most likely created by the accumulation of gas and grains into planetesimals , as supported by the non - detection of circumstellar gas in this disk ( dent et al .",
    "1995 , liseau 1999 ) ; and by the fact that the pr drag alone is not sufficient to clear the dust out to large radii up to @xmath430@xmath11 ( jura 1990 , greaves et al .  1998 , dent et al .",

    "satisfactory fit to the observed sed was achievable . using emissivities calculated from real dust mixtures , however , sheret , dent , & wyatt ( 2003 ) found that compact grains are not able to fit the observed sed .",

    "( 2000 ) and quillen & thorndike ( 2002 ) , these features may be caused by the capture of grains into the mean motion resonances with a planet of jupiter - mass embedded in the disk .",
