    "relativistic jets are ubiquitous among astrophysical systems that involve accretion onto compact objects , such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and microquasars ( see , e.g. a review by * ? ? ?",
    "it is commonly agreed that these jets are powered electromagnetically , most likely by the winding of magnetic field lines that thread a rotating central compact object @xcite .",
    "the winding generates a poynting flux dominated outflow , which eventually becomes the jet , at the expense of the rotational energy of the central engine .",
    "although significant progress has been made recently in understanding how jets are formed magnetically ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) , their physics , most notably the stability properties and the energy dissipation mechanisms , is the subject of active debate . in the context of non - relativistic jets ,",
    "the expectation is that magnetised jets are strongly unstable to current - driven instabilities .",
    "for instance , show that non - relativistic jets readily develop current - driven , non - axisymmetric , kink ( @xmath0 ) modes whose properties depend on the conditions at the jet base . in the core collapse of a massive star , heavily mass - loaded jets , which are produced by the rotation of a protoneutron star @xcite ,",
    "were found to be so strongly unstable to the kink instability that they were unable to penetrate the star @xcite . if this instability were to extend also to the relativistic , highly magnetised jets this would have serious implications on the properties of relativistic jets and the engines that launch them . in the context of long - duration grbs @xcite it would imply that magnetised jets are unable to break out of the star , a necessary condition to form a grb .",
    "therefore , it would mean that grb jets have to be created _ unmagnetised _ , making it impossible to power them by the electromagnetic spindown of the central object .",
    "however , the observed properties of relativistic jets suggest otherwise .",
    "for example , the high power observed in grb and agn jets significantly challenges the known non - magnetic energy extraction mechanisms available in these objects ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , a recently discovered correlation between the jet magnetic field strength and the accretion disc luminosity in agn @xcite , and several surprising features that are seen in grb lightcurves and can be naturally produced by magnetic jets @xcite strongly support the magnetic origin of the jet power .",
    "on the other , hand if the magnetic jets were mostly stable it would be difficult to explain the high energy emission radiated from them ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in a stable jet about half of the energy",
    "remains locked in the magnetic form , out to very large distances @xcite .",
    "in such a case internal shocks , which are commonly invoked to explain the observed high energy emission , are weak @xcite and can not accelerate efficiently the radiating electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "various alternative dissipation mechanisms have been discussed in this context , including striped wind like magnetic field configurations , which are susceptible to reconnection , microphysical energy dissipation mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and effects from intermittent engine ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to date , no universally - accepted mechanism that is capable of efficiently converting jet magnetic energy into radiation exists .",
    "the presence of a local current - driven instability in a mildly unstable jet could be sufficient for triggering magnetic dissipation and powering the observed grb emission .",
    "this motivates a focused , high - resolution study of jet stability in the context of core - collapse grb jets .",
    "current - driven instability is mainly a 3d effect and can be highly non - linear .",
    "thus 3d simulations are needed to study it .",
    "the standard approach for simulating magnetic jets is sending loops of magnetic field into the computational domain at a fixed rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case , the strengths of the poloidal magnetic field component , @xmath1 ( i.e. , lying in the plane passing through the jet axis ) , and azimuthal component , @xmath2 ( perpendicular to the plane ) , are arbitrary",
    "however , jet stability depends sensitively on the ratio between the two .",
    "thus , the results of such jet `` injection '' simulations reflect a particular ( arbitrary ) choice for the injection boundary condition , making it difficult to interpret them .",
    "lately , @xcite showed analytically that poynting - dominated jets that form at the center of collapsing stars are at least marginally stable and can punch through the stellar envelope without being disrupted by magnetic instability .",
    "however , in the absence of a full 3d numerical simulation , they had to assume a ratio between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and did not address the question of magnetic energy dissipation .        in nature",
    ", the strengths of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field components are tightly connected .",
    "this is because the jets are produced by the rotation of magnetised compact objects , so @xmath2 emerges from the winding of @xmath1 .",
    "the winding creates an outward poynting flux . in the presence of an ambient medium , which confines the electromagnetic outflow , the magnetic tension of the azimuthal field builds up , until it focuses the outflow into twin polar collimated jets @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : headed_vs_headless](a ) .",
    "these jets start propagating once their pressure becomes high enough to push the ambient medium aside . as the jet propagates , it develops a slow - moving `` head '' : a working surface at which the jet drills through the ambient material and which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : headed_vs_headless](a ) in dark blue",
    ". the head blocks the free expansion of the toroidal magnetic flux in the jet and keeps the jet toroidal magnetic pressure high . as a result , the jet pushes against the head with a greater force .",
    "we term this type of jets _ headed _ jets .",
    "the relative strength of toroidal and poloidal fields in the jet is therefore linked with the properties of the ambient medium that collimates it .",
    "thus , any attempt to analyse jet stability should take into consideration the presence of the ambient medium and its effect on the jet magnetic field configuration .",
    "jets that expand into a pre - existing , evacuated funnel are of different nature . they are free to accelerate to super fast - magnetosonic velocities , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : headed_vs_headless](b ) .",
    "the tip of the latter jets can not communicate backward , and the jet material behaves as if it were part of an infinite jet . in these jets",
    ", the toroidal and poloidal fields can be in equipartition in the fluid frame @xcite .",
    "we term these jets _ headless _ jets to distinguish them from the headed jets discussed above .    in this work",
    "we address two important questions in the physics of magnetised grb jets : the stability of the jet as it propagates in the star and the dissipation of its magnetic energy .",
    "we present the results from a numerical study of the formation and propagation of relativistic poynting flux dominated jets in a dense medium typical for a grb progenitor star .",
    "the jets are formed by the rotation of a magnetised neutron star ( ns ) with a super - strong magnetic field , or a magnetar , in the same manner as described earlier .",
    "thus , the magnetic field configuration is generated self - consistently , without any ad hoc assumptions about the ratio between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "this allows us to study jet stability from first principles .",
    "note that even though we focus on grb jets , our results are general and apply to relativistic jets in other astrophysical systems , such as agn jets .",
    "we start by describing our numerical scheme and the problem setup ( section  [ sec : scheme ] ) and reviewing the main aspects of kink instability in magnetically - dominated jets ( section  [ sec : primer ] ) .",
    "we then discuss the difference between headless jets , which are launched into a preexisting funnel ( section  [ sec : ideal ] ) , and headed jets , which drill their way though a dense ambient medium ( section  [ sec:2d ] ) .",
    "we show that while headless jets are relatively stable to kink modes , headed jets are kink - unstable . in section  [ sec:3d ] ,",
    "we analyse the results of our 3d jet simulations and discuss the effect that the kink instability has on the jets and the limitations of our work .",
    "we then construct an analytic model that describes the jet properties ( section  [ sec : analytical ] ) . in section  [ sec : astrophysical ]",
    ", we discuss the astrophysical implications for grb and agn jets .",
    "we finish by comparing our results to previous works done on the subject ( section  [ sec : other_works ] ) and conclude ( section  [ sec : disc - concl ] ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we use both spherical ( @xmath3 ) and cylindrical ( @xmath4 ) coordinates .",
    "we carry out our simulations using the ` harm ` code ( gammie et al 2003 ) , with recent improvements ( mckinney 2006 ; tchekhovskoy et al . 2007 , 2009 ; mckinney & blandford 2009 , tchekhovskoy et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this is a static mesh , 3d , general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) code capable of following the evolution of high magnetisation flows while conserving mass , energy and momentum to machine precision .",
    "an important advantage of the code is its ability to use curved grids , as we explain below .",
    "we run both 2d ( axisymmetric ) and 3d simulations on a grid that spans a range @xmath5 in spherical polar coordinates , @xmath6 ) .",
    "we set the boundary conditions to be reflecting at the poles ( @xmath7 ) , free streaming at the outer radial boundary ( @xmath8 ) , and periodic in the @xmath9direction .",
    "the radial grid is uniformly spaced in @xmath10 out to the radius @xmath11 , beyond which the grid becomes progressively sparse .",
    "tables [ tab : models_grid ] and [ tab : models_properties ] summarise the parameters of different models we use in this work , and we give more details in the corresponding sections .    at the inner radial boundary ( @xmath12 ) , we place a perfectly conducting sphere carrying a monopole magnetic field . at the beginning of the simulation , the sphere is instantaneously spun up to a constant angular frequency .",
    "this generates poynting flux dominated outflow that emanates from the surface of the sphere .",
    "we spin the inner sphere at a rather large angular frequency @xmath13 so that the light cylinder , the cylindrical radius at which co - rotation velocity equals the speed of light , @xmath14 is a few times @xmath15 .",
    "this allows us to speed up the simulation while keeping the physics the same @xcite .",
    "outside the sphere we set a static background density that resembles the interior of a star .",
    "the ambient density is a continuous single power - law distribution @xmath16 that extends between an inner `` bubble '' of radius @xmath17 and the outer radius of the grid .",
    "we will focus in this work on @xmath18 , a value of power - law index that is characteristic of wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we assume cold medium , ignore gravity , and do not impart any perturbations to the initial conditions .",
    "numerical mhd codes can not evolve vacuum of density .",
    "therefore , we set the boundary condition at @xmath12 and the initial density @xmath19 in the region between @xmath20 and @xmath21 by demanding that the terminal lorentz factor of the flow , which is controlled by the initial magnetisation of the flow , is @xmath22 .",
    "this value is high enough ( @xmath23 ) to lead to a relativistically - magnetised outflow and at the same time low enough to keep the numerical noise to a minimum .    in the context of grbs",

    "table  [ tab : models_grid ] summarises the parameters of the numerical grid we used to carry out the simulations , while table  [ tab : models_properties ] lists the physical parameters of the setup , giving them in dimensionless units as well as physical units specialised to grbs and agns .",
    "the essential parameters that control the jet stability are given in the first two columns of table  [ tab : models_properties ] : ( i ) the dimensionless magnetic field energy density ( in units of ambient density ) , @xmath37 , which is a proxy for jet power @xmath38 , and ( ii ) the power - law index of the ambient density distribution , @xmath39 .",
    "the third parameter , @xmath40 , reflects the fraction of the stellar surface area that launches the outflow , which is slightly different in 2d and 3d simulations , as we discuss below .",
    "the fourth parameter , @xmath41 , sets the initial magnetisation of the outflow and does not influence the simulation outcome so long as @xmath42 : it affects the results only at larger distances than those simulated here ( e.g. , outside the star ) .",
    "we carry out our 2d simulations on a spherical polar grid that is modified to concentrate grid cells toward the polar axis , where the jets form , by deforming the radial grid lines into parabolae , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] .",
    "we direct the rotational axis along the polar axis ( @xmath43 ) and use a resolution of @xmath44 in the @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath9 directions , respectively ( see table [ tab : models_grid ] ) . at this resolution",
    "the light cylinder ( @xmath47 ) is resolved by @xmath48 cells , at an altitude @xmath49 , and the jet width by @xmath50 cells .",
    "we ran the simulations with both dipole and monopole magnetic field geometries and verified that in both cases the resultant jet properties are qualitatively the same .",
    "this is because in both cases the jet field lines stretch from the central source to the jet head and return back to the source ( see section [ sec:2d ] ) .",
    "the only essential difference is that in the dipole case there is a region of closed field lines around the equator of the central object , which modify the conditions near the base of the jet @xcite .",
    "we verified that for an aligned rotator , this effect does not substantially affect the properties of the jet at higher altitudes .",

    "the existence of a polar coordinate singularity in the grid along the @xmath54axis leads to numerical difficulties when matter and magnetic fields pass through the pole . as a result",
    ", magnetic field lines can not cross the pole freely and get wrapped around the @xmath55axis .",
    "this is not a problem in the 2d case , since all quantities have azimuthal symmetry , and no mass , momentum , or energy flows through the pole .",
    "however in the 3d case , we found that the imperfect flow through the axis leads to an artificial stability of the jets . to avoid this non - physical behaviour , we opted for reorienting the rotational axis of the central objet to point along the @xmath56direction , and we collimate the radial grid lines along the @xmath56axis accordingly .",
    "namely , the collimation is performed such that the @xmath46 and @xmath9angles of the radial grid lines deformed independently .",
    "note that when reporting the simulation results , we will use the natural coordinate system set by the jet orientation , with the @xmath55axis pointing along the rotational axis .    to avoid sending any fluxes through the @xmath55axis , we spin not the entire star but only its northern and southern polar regions that are within @xmath57 of the rotational axis .",

    "they witnessed that the energy dissipation associated with the kink instability led to an increase in the jet core size , similar to our findings .",
    "since their jets were infinite , the instability could grow in the jet indefinitely , and the jets were eventually disrupted after @xmath357 .",
    "they also confirmed that the jets remain stable if they expand sideways with a velocity that is fast enough , so that the conditions for strong transverse causal contact are not met .",
    "we find that in a time - dependent case , the sideways expansion of the cocoon does lead to an increase in the jet radius with time .",
    "however , in the environments that are relevant for grb and agn jets , the rate of the expnasion is slow , and the jet remains in strong causal contact .",
    "studies of the energy dissipation processes in stationary , non - relativistic magnetised jets were conducted by and in the context of solar flares .",
    "they all considered a cylindrical jet with poloidal field dominated core surrounded by a toroidal field dominated sheath with a profile steeper than @xmath162 . in their setup",
    "the jet is surrounded by a uniform magnetic field in the @xmath55direction , which provides support for the jet from the sides , similar to the effect of the cocoon in our case . in all of their simulations the internal kink evolved in the jet on a time scale comparable to the expected linear growth growth time , @xmath356 .",
    "the internal kink resulted in magnetic energy dissipation over a comparable time scale .",
    "it led to the dissipation of most of the toroidal component of the field , and to a jet with mostly a poloidal field .",
    "this result is consistent with the internal dissipation in our collimated jets .",
    "global simulations of poynting dominated jets were conducted by @xcite .",
    "they injected a cylindrical jet at the lower boundary of their grid and tracked its propagation .",
    "the ambient medium was composed of a spherically symmetric supernova gas that expands homologously into a uniform density medium .",
    "the jets were assumed to be cylindrical , with only toroidal field and thermal pressure . the thermal pressure dominated in the core ( @xmath358 ) , and the toroidal pressure dominated outside the core .",
    "they tested jets with several @xmath186 parameters and lorentz factors .",
    "their jets were deformed considerably above @xmath359 , as expected .",
    "they also found indications that at the region where magnetic energy was dissipated , field lines became more aligned with the average jet velocity , indicating an effective decrease of toroidal field in the jet .",
    "the overall morphology of the jet and its propagation velocity were consistent with our results .",
    "@xcite carried out global , non - relativistic mhd simulations of agn jets propagating in a gravitationally stratified isothermal medium .",
    "they injected non - rotating , magnetised jets with a prescribed magnetic pitch @xmath360 .",
    "they found evidence of both internal kink at smaller distances and external kink at larger distances once they perturbed the ambient medium .",
    "they did not find any jet heating by the internal kink .",
    "@xcite carried out relativistic mhd simulations of non - rotating jets injected at a distance of @xmath361 gravitational radii into a uniform background medium and followed them for about @xmath60 orders of magnitude in distance .",
    "the transverse radius of their injected jets was marginally resolved by @xmath362 grid cells .",
    "they found that when the jet material is injected with ratios of @xmath363 it develops internal kink modes and experiences substantial dissipation of magnetic energy , similar to our work . above the dissipation regions , their jets seem",
    "to be considerably more bodily kinked then ours .",
    "this is possibly because they propagate in a uniform density profile that applies a larger resistive force on the jet head than in our case .",
    "similar to our work , they found that the instabilities slowed down the jet propagation but did not disrupt the jets .    on the analytic front , @xcite obtained steady state solutions to the structure of collimated poynting dominated jets .",
    "he showed that when the jet is collimated far from the linear acceleration regime , it is focused into a recollimation nozzle due to the excess force of hoop stress .",
    "based on these solutions , @xcite postulated that if the recollimation nozzle is narrow enough , strong dissipation should occur which will effectively convert the magnetic into thermal energy .",
    "models for the propagation of a poynting dominated grb jet in a star were developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both groups obtained similar , mildly relativistic values for the velocity of the jet head .",
    "however , since they ignored the wobbling motions of the head due to the external kink instability , they overestimated the head velocity . based on their findings of the jet width , @xcite concluded that the magnetic field is dissipated at the base of the jet , leading to a hydrodynamic jet .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion based on the short breakout time of the jet from the star that their model predicted .",
    "indeed , we find that efficient dissipation of magnetic energy takes place at the recollimation nozzle , however it affects not all , but about half of the magnetic energy .",
    "in this work we present the results of a global numerical 3d mhd stability study of relativistic poynting flux dominated jets that propagate in an ambient medium .",
    "the stability of a jet largely depends on the way it is launched and the ambient medium it interacts with . in order for our simulations to have predictive power",
    "when it comes to jet stability , we set them up to launch the jets in the same way as nature does it : via the magnetised rotation of a central compact object .",
    "the magnetised outflow thus produced has a wide opening angle initially . as it interacts with the ambient medium , magnetic pinch forces",
    "collimate it into twin narrow oppositely directed near - cylindrical jets . in this way",
    ", the structure of the jets is established self - consistently , without any a priori assumptions about , e.g. , the jet lorentz factor , opening angle , or magnetic pitch angle .",
    "all of these quantities control jet stability ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : primer ] ) and are determined self - consistently by the jet launching physics .",
    "in fact , our models are characterised by just two basic dimensionless parameters describing the astrophysical system : the energy density of the poloidal magnetic field of the central compact object ( in units of the ambient gas density ) and the slope of the ambient gas density distribution ( see table  [ tab : models_properties ] ) .",
    "we make a distinction between the jets that propagate in an empty , pre - drilled funnel and the jets that have to drill their funnel for themselves .",
    "the former , _ headless jets _ , propagate unobstructed , accelerate to high lorentz factors , and do not easily show signs of instability .",
    "the latter , _ headed jets _ , have much larger pitch angles ( reflecting a stronger toroidal magnetic field component ) and propagate slower due to the need to expend energy on the drilling through the ambient gas ; both of these effects make headed jets unstable to current - driven , non - axisymmetric instabilities .",
    "as headed jets run into the ambient medium , they collimate off of it . in fact , they recollimate and rebound , which leads to a nozzle - like shape of the jet ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_jet_fieldline ] ) .",
    "we show that recollimation  induced ",
    "compression causes the jets to become unstable to the internal kink mode .",
    "this instability appears without any perturbations imparted to the jets or the ambient gas and leads to efficient dissipation of the toroidal magnetic field component .",
    "the instability operates until the equipartition between thermal and magnetic energies is reached : the thermal pressure stabilises the jets against the further growth of the internal kink @xcite , and the dissipation stops at plasma @xmath364 .",
    "we find that the dissipation rate is comparable to the growth rate of the internal kink modes , with most of the dissipation taking place close to the recollimation point . our simulations do not include explicit resistivity .",
    "encouragingly , we find that the dissipation rate is rather insensitive to the numerical resolution .",
    "the rate is consistent with that found in resistive mhd simulations of internal kink instability in the context of solar flares and ideal relativistic mhd simulations of steady state jets in periodic boxes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore possible that in some cases the dissipation rate can be determined by the rate at which the macroscopic instability creates and brings together field lines of opposite polarity and is rather insensitive to reconnection microphysics .",
    "we stress that whereas in our simulations jet recollimation leads to dissipation , the nature of dissipation is different from the usual picture of dissipation at a recollimation shock in a hydrodynamic jet .",
    "even highly magnetised jets can undergo a recollimation shock provided the jet is super - fast magnetosonic .",
    "however , not much dissipation occurs at the shock itself , and instead the dissipation happens due to the activation of the internal kink instability in the post - shock / post - recollimation region : at the shock , the flow velocity decreases and @xmath85 increases , both of which encourage the development of an internal kink mode . in the context of agn , such a jet recollimation can be responsible for bright features seen in the jets at around the bondi radius : for instance , the hst-1 component in the m87 jet @xcite could be caused by the dissipation via the internal kink mode near the recollimation point where the jet starts interacting with the interstellar medium and the bright components emerging from and/or passing through hst-1 might be the dissipation sites caused by the kink instability .",
    "the jets emerge from the dissipation region with the toroidal magnetic field component greatly weakened and the thermal jet content much boosted by the dissipation .",
    "this has a stabilising effect on the internal kink mode and causes the dissipation to be localised near the jet recollimation point .",
    "this dissipation continues long after the jets break out of the star ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : equipart ] ) .",
    "since the magnetic energy is dissipated deep inside the star , the emerging plasma contains enough photons to account for the grb emission @xcite .",
    "however , the non - thermal emission observed in many grbs likely requires additional dissipation to occur close to or beyond the photosphere .",
    "this can happen if the plasma cools by adiabatic expansion or sub - photospheric emission and regains high enough magnetisation for the internal kink mode to be revived .",
    "it is also conceivable that if the plasma undergoes a rapid expansion phase when exiting the star , parts of it may attain a low enough magnetisation @xcite , and the internal shocks may become effective ; however , it is unclear if these parts carry sufficient amounts of energy to power the prompt emission .",
    "additional magnetic dissipation can be expected if the magnetic flux threading the jets switches polarity , either due to the oblique magnetic field of a central magnetar producing a striped wind @xcite or due to the accretion of matter with alternating magnetic field polarity onto the central bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the jet residual magnetic field content beyond the recollimation point is sufficient to trigger the external kink instability , which leads to large - scale helical motions and bends , causing the jet head to wobble ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3dextkink ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the effective cross - section of the jets increases and the jet propagation velocity decreases . using an analytic model",
    ", we show that the stability of our relativistically - hot jets to the external kink mode is controlled by the following dimensionless parameter , @xmath365 where @xmath284 is the ambient density , @xmath253 is the distance to the jet head , and @xmath89 is the lorentz factor of jet material ( which is larger than that of the jet head ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] ) .",
    "when @xmath305 substantially exceeds unity , the external kink does not have sufficient time to evolve in the jets , and the wobbling motions remain small . in this case , the jets propagate at a similar velocity to hydrodynamic jets .",
    "however , when @xmath366 , the jet heads become unstable to external kink modes .",
    "the jet head velocity significantly decreases and becomes much smaller than that of hydrodynamic jets .",
    "using our analytic model , we show the stability of the jets and the propagation velocity of their heads are closely related to the profile of the external density . in ambient density profiles steeper than @xmath367 ,",
    "the jets accelerate and become more stable with increasing distance . in flatter profiles , however , the jets decelerate and become exceedingly unstable .",
    "we expect that eventually the head velocity becomes comparable to the expansion velocity of the shocked external gas , which then outruns the jets .",
    "this may cause the jets to stall .",
    "the concept of a stalled jet can explain the difference in the morphology of fri and frii radio galaxy jets @xcite .",
    "the jets of fri galaxies usually extend to several tens of kpc , are engulfed in a massive cocoon , and shine along the entire body .",
    "frii galaxy jets , on the other hand , are much longer on average ( @xmath368  kpc ) , maintain straight course and have a well - defined , bright , hot spot at the jet head .",
    "these differences can be explained via the effects of the external kink instability . in the flat density profiles of galaxy cluster cores ,",
    "the jets decelerate as they propagate outwards .",
    "therefore , a minimal power exists above which they are able to break out of these cores .",
    "we estimate this minimal power to be @xmath369 erg  s@xmath370 , adopting typical properties of radio galaxies ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : astrophysical ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : models_properties ] ) .",
    "jets with a lower power become external  kink  unstable inside the core .",
    "they develop wobbling motions which increase their effective cross - section and cause them to slow down until they are overrun by their cocoons that continuously expand .",
    "the increased wobbling motions can also trigger dissipation along the jets that leads to radiation , making the jets shine and appear as fri jets .",
    "a higher luminosity jet will break out of the flat density core before becoming highly kink - unstable and will continue to accelerate in the steep ambient density profile that surrounds the galaxy core .",
    "such a jet will remain stable and will appear as an frii jet .    in the grb case ,",
    "the density profile of the stellar envelope is so steep that the jets become exceedingly more stable as they propagate outward .",
    "we find that typical grb jets are marginally stable and propagate at a velocity @xmath371 , similar to the velocity of hydrodynamic jets ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_vs_model ] ) .",
    "they break out of the star in about @xmath372  seconds .",
    "@xcite concluded that poynting flux dominated jets need to dissipate their energy close to the source in order for the breakout time to be consistent with observations .",
    "we show here that such a dissipation mechanism indeed exists near the recollimation point of the jet .",
    "the breakout time agrees with that inferred from the distribution of grb duration times @xcite .",
    "the similarity between the propagation velocities of hydrodynamic and our relativistically - hot mhd jets suggests that it is difficult if not impossible to distinguish between magnetic and hydrodynamic energy injection mechanisms in the jets based on the observed breakout time alone .",
    "we find that if the power of a ( single ) grb jet drops below @xmath373  erg  s@xmath370 , which corresponds to an isotropic equivalent luminosity of @xmath374 , the jet becomes so strongly unstable to the external kink mode inside the star that its propagation velocity significantly drops ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : astrophysical ] ) .",
    "this can lead to a situation where the grb engine shuts off before the jet is able to breakout of the star . in this case , only the cocoon breaks out of the star , and feasibly leads to a different type of burst , which may resemble a low - luminosity grb @xcite .",
    "we note that whereas our simulations are carried out for a neutron star as the central compact object , our results are applicable to the case of an accreting black hole .",
    "this is because both black holes and neutron stars launch the jets via the azimuthal winding of poloidal magnetic field lines , as we discussed previously .",
    "the difference is that the field line winding in the case of the neutron star is due to the rotation of an actual , physical surface with magnetic field lines frozen into it , and in the black hole case it is due to the rotation of the space - time  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the presence of a black hole accretion disc , which we do not include in this work , may change the conditions at the base of the jet and affect the jet structure . for instance , a disc wind may alter the confining pressure profile of the jet .",
    "these effects will be studied elsewhere .    in this work ,",
    "we only studied jet propagation for 3 orders of magnitude in distance .",
    "this is short by about an order of magnitude in distance of the actual stellar surface .",
    "carrying out longer - term simulations that extend up to and beyond the stellar surface are important for verifying the stability of the jet out to larger distances and testing our analytic models in this new regime .",
    "we have not studied the processes that occur in the jets upon their breakout of the star .",
    "the breakout can be accompanied with substantial acceleration @xcite and the loss of causal contact across the jet @xcite , both of which can affect the development of the instability .",
    "the simulations of jet breakout are important also in order to compute a first - principles structure of the jet outside of the star to improve the grb prompt and afterglow emission modelling .",
    "the main finding of this work is the efficient dissipation of the jet magnetic field near the recollimation point via the internal kink instability .",
    "though the dissipation rate is presently difficult to measure quantitatively due to the inherent time variability and potential sensitivity to the microphysics , the outcome of the internal kink instability  a hot jet with thermal and magnetic energies in equipartition  is robust .",
    "it was obtained by multiple groups in various contexts using different numerical methods .",
    "thus , the jet material that emerges from the star is both relativistically - hot and relativistically - magnetised .",
    "we conclude that the internal kink instability leads to jets that have enough magnetic and thermal energy to accelerate to the highly relativistic lorentz factors inferred for grbs , and carry a substantial thermal energy flux , which can be used to power the prompt emission .",
