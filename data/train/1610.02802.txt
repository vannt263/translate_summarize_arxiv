    "1cometary impacts is considered to have affected the stratospheric composition of all four gas giant planets . on jupiter ,",
    "the 1994 collision of the fragments of comet shoemaker - levy 9 ( referred to as the sl9 event ) caused the delivery of volatile gases such as co , hcn , , , , ocs , and cs 1 in stratosphere ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recent sub - millimeter observations have revealed that the upper stratospheric co molar fraction on saturn , uranus and neptune is larger than that at the lower ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that indicates the presence of a co external supply . on neptune , since the measured co/ and co/ flux ratios are larger than the cometary [ co]/ and [ co]/ values , the rather than a steady influx of inter - planetary dust particle ( idp ) and subsequent evaporation @xcite . moreover , observed vertical distribution of the stratospheric co on saturn and uranus match with the cometary impact model , not the idp model ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    1for the understanding of the influence of cometary impact event on the jovian stratospheric composition , the detailed investigation of the time variation of the mass of the post - sl9 species on jupiter yield valuable information .",
    "we have focused on the . after the sl9 event , some s - bearing species were newly discovered in jupiter s stratosphere various wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet to sub - millimeter . within a month after the sl9 event , was observed to be a dominant sulfur reservoir among the species discovered , such as , ocs , cs and possibly ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the abundances of observed s - bearing species have shown different time variations such that while the spectral features of , , ocs and had faded within a month ( @xcite ) , cs molecule became a major sulfur reservoir instead . since the total mass of observed in 1994 as 10@xmath4 g was comparable with that of cs in 1995 , cs was expected to be produced mainly by the conversion of ( @xcite ) . to explain the conversion of into cs",
    ", @xcite developed a sulfur chemistry model such that can produce cs through a reaction with as follows : .",
    "hcs and were expected to work as the intermediates to produce cs by the following reactions : , .",
    "frequent millimeter and sub - millimeter observations of cs , hcn and co have performed from 1994 to 1998 to monitor their abundance , horizontal and vertical distributions by using the institut de radioastronomie millimtrique ( iram ) 30-m telescope and 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) . since the total mass of cs measured in 1998 as 1.4@xmath50.6@xmath610@xmath7 g was within the uncertainty of the value measured in 1995 , no time variation of cs abundance",
    "was found during the monitoring period .",
    "the vertical distribution of cs was modeled as a simple two - layer model with a pressure level . in 1995 ,",
    "the value was derived to be 0.15 mbar at a longitude of 44@xmath8s where .",
    "owing to the vertical of gases , the pressure level moved downward approximately 0.2 mbar and 0.3 mbar in 1996 and 1998 , respectively .",
    "@xcite expected the value in 2014 to be 1.0 mbar according to the vertical transportation model .",
    "jupiter , several attempts have been made to detect s - bearing species on saturn and neptune(@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , negative observation results of , and cs on saturn , and additional so , ocs and on neptune reported . the discrepancies of these results with that of jupiter is interesting since the cometary on both planets have been suggested .",
    "although the conversion process of into cs occurring just after the impact has been fully explained already(@xcite ) , the sulfur chemistry to the destruction of 1the cs is unknown .    in 2013",
    ", we conducted new observation typically sensitive to 1and composition . in this paper , detail of the observation , data analysis and observation results are given in section 2 .",
    "sulfur chemistry in jupiter s stratosphere is discussed in section 3 .",
    "our observation was performed by using the atacama sub - millimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) 10-m single - dish telescope ( @xcite ) , operated by national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) , located at an altitude of 4800 m on the atacama highland , chile .",
    "observation was performed from 9:36 ut to 11:33 ut , october 1 , 2013 .",
    "the angular diameter of jupiter was 37.5  whereas the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the aste at the 350 ghz band is 22  .",
    "the observation was conducted during the same period as our neptune observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used a sideband separating mixer receiver cats345 ( @xcite ) that can be tuned from 324 ghz to 372 ghz . for cs ,",
    "only the @xmath0=76 rotational transition is observable in the frequency range of cats345 .",
    "separation of v and h polarization is not available during observation season . for the back - end ,",
    "a mac xf type digital spectrometer ( @xcite ) was used with 512 mhz bandwidth and 500 khz spectral resolution .",
    "focus was before the observing 1run .",
    "similar to the previous observations jupiter and saturn ( @xcite , ) , both equatorial edges of jupiter were set as on and off positions to achieve the high signal to noise ratio .",
    "the integration time for each on and off position was 15 s. for the pointing accuracy correction , cross - scan pointing observation of jupiter s continuum emission was performed before and during the observing time .",
    "the measured pointing which are better than the 2-3  typical pointing error of the aste . owing to the low elevation angle during the observation as 39.5@xmath8 - 44.5@xmath8 , the measured system temperature value of 532 - 627 k was higher than the typical value of aste of 250 k.    just after the observation , one of the standard sources of aste , irc10216 ,",
    "was observed to .",
    "the obtained 6.1 k cs intensity of irc10216 with the previous single - sideband calibrated intensity of caltech submillimeter observatory(cso)(@xcite ) obtained as 5.7@xmath50.4 k in the antenna temperature scale .",
    "the vertical and horizontal axes are expressed in the antenna temperature scale in units of kelvin , and the rest frequency in ghz . to decrease the observed baseline structure ,",
    "the polynomial fitting method was employed for each observation scans .",
    "second , all of baseline - corrected scans equivalent to 47 min integration time were .",
    "the integrated spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] in black lines .",
    "the absorption structure is the 1subtracted emission of the off position .",
    "the obtained intensities for respective on and off positions are @xmath1120 mk in the antenna temperature scale .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) noise level achieved here is 18.1 mk .",
    "therefore , detection of the cs line was achieved with 6.6@xmath9 confidence .      for the derivation of the cs abundance and vertical distribution ,",
    "an atmospheric 1radiative transfer algorithm developed for terrestrial minor species ( @xcite ) was modified and applied to the spectrum . the rest frequency ,",
    "line intensity and partition function of cs were extracted from the hitran 2012 spectroscopic database ( @xcite ) .",
    "the atmospheric structure employed here was the same as the previous observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relationship of the pressure broadening coefficient @xmath10 with atmospheric pressure p and temperature t is described as follows : @xmath10 = @xmath10@xmath6(p/)@xmath6(/t)@xmath11 @xmath121@xmath13bar@xmath14 , where , and n are 1 bar , 300 k and 0.75 , respectively , and @xmath10 is pressure broadening coefficient of cs at and as 0.125 @xmath121@xmath13bar@xmath14 .",
    "@xmath10 value used here was that of used in the previous study of @xcite ( provided by r. moreno , private communication ) .",
    "for the continuum opacity , the collision induced absorption ( cia ) of - and -he pairs were employed for each atmospheric layers .",
    "the values of cia were obtained from the hitran catalogue . for the main beam efficiency value , we assumed the typical value of aste as 0.6 .",
    "the spherical geometry was modeled to take into account the limb effect . .",
    "various vertical distribution models in which cs is present uniformly above the = 0.01 - 1.0 mbar pressure level were attempted to reproduce the obtained spectrum .",
    "only the cs molar fraction was 1varied as the free parameters      1from the analysis of the line width , we find that the most probable value 0.2 mbar , which consistent with measured in 1998 as ( @xcite ) .",
    "1@xmath9 error of from 0.05 to 0.6 mbar region . 1corresponding and",
    "column density of = 0.2 mbar model were 1.1@xmath610@xmath15 and 3.48@xmath610@xmath7 molecules @xmath16 , respectively . .",
    "cs vertical profile for the = 0.05 , 0.20 and 0.60 mbar models , @xmath56 and @xmath53 k stratospheric temperature models are plotted in figure [ fig : vertical_distribution ] along with that of cs measured in 1998 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in may 1995 , 10 months after the sl9 event , the cs column density measured at 44@xmath8s at the latitude of comet collision was reported as 0.6 - 1.4@xmath610@xmath17 @xmath16 .",
    "thus , our new observation shows that the cs decreased 1by up to @xmath190@xmath2 1with respect to . due to the low s / n ,",
    "1we have not attempted to constrain the temporal variation of the vertical distribution of cs and thus eddy mixing in jupiter s stratosphere .",
    "1explaining the decrease of the cs column density is important for the understanding of the sulfur chemistry in the stratosphere of gas giants .",
    "condensation or polymerization processes may contribute to the removal of cs from the gas phase to produce solid or liquid phase , or polymerized cs expressed as ( cs ) .",
    "1phase change or polymerization of cs could occur in the stratosphere as temperature decreases and number density increases with decreasing altitude .",
    "however , the precise evaluation of the phase change is unavailable due to the absence of phase change parameters in the literature .",
    "polymerization is a characteristic phenomenon of s - bearing species .",
    "in particular , polymerization of cs on the aerosol surface , which would occur and remove the gas phase cs .    from the photochemical perspective , the discovery of cs even in 19 years after the production is interesting because cs is considered to be a chemically unstable molecule due to its short lifetime against the photolysis .",
    "photolysis ( ) is the rapid destruction process of cs in the gas phase .",
    "therefore , the discovery of a cs molecule on jupiter suggests the presence of a recycling process for cs .    in the case of neptune ,",
    "a previous large cometary impact is suggested by the larger 1external flux of co than that of water vapor ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "1the absence of cs ( and other s - bearing molecules ) , as found with aste ( @xcite ) , could contradict the comet impact hypothesis .",
    "however , a detailed sulfur chemistry model should be developed for the further assessment whether the absence of cs is compatible with a comet impact scenario on neptune ( and also on saturn ) .",
    "such a model would be helpful in understanding the temporal evolution of the cs mass in jupiter s stratosphere .",
    "once the sulfur chemistry on jupiter is revealed , the result will be not only to neptune but also to saturn where the previous cometary impacts are suggested .",
    "raphael moreno of observatoire de paris is appreciated for offering advice and providing the pressure - broadening coefficient of cs , which was of significant help for our study .",
    "the observation was supported by chihaya kato of isee and chihomi hara of university of tokyo .",
    "proposal writing was supported and advised by akira mizuno , takehiro hidemori and satonori nozawa of isee .",
    "ti is also grateful for the continuous encouragement given by takao kokugan , toshiyuki watanabe , yongbo li and tetsuya mizutani of tuat .",
    "the aste telescope is operated by naoj .",
