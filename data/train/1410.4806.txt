    "@xcite allows to compute the two lyapunov exponents of the diagonal : @xmath44 with @xmath45 the lyapunov exponent of the 1d pomeau - manneville map ( [ pm1 ] ) with initial condition @xmath46 ; from the expression for the second exponent @xmath47 one can see that , when the coupling parameter @xmath48 is large enough , @xmath47 becomes negative and the diagonal turns into an _ attracting set _ , leading to global synchronization  @xcite ( that is , the system synchronizes for any initial condition in the unit square @xmath28 ) .",
    "thus , by setting @xmath49 , the critical coupling value @xmath50 above which synchronization appears is obtained : @xmath51 and it depends on parameter @xmath16 trough the exponent @xmath45 ; this relation holds for any pair of diffusively coupled , _ identical _",

    "interestingly , this scenario holds even in the non - synchronizing regime , when the diagonal is repelling ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this is a first hint about the _ structural _ change in the map caused by the coupling : in the uncoupled case @xmath57 , the whole neighbourhood of the origin is affected by its marginal stability and the associated slow - down ; instead , in the coupled case @xmath64 the slow - down affects _ only _ the diagonal , while the infinitesimal neighbourhood of the origin is _ contracted _ toward the diagonal along its transversal direction .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical phase - space densities presented in the next section .",
    "to analyse the phase - space structure of the pm2 map , we compute numerical densities for orbits of length @xmath65 over a square grid of @xmath66 cells ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ) : this shows that no dynamical barriers are present , with the orbit visiting all the cells of the partition even for arbitrarily small couplings .",
    "the observation of inhomogeneities in a small neighbourhood of the origin leads us to perform the same phase - space analysis employing a square - grid partition in _ logarithmic _",
    "scale for coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath67 , as presented in the fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) : this reveals that the density is dominated by a very complicated structure of _ discontinuity lines _ which delimit regions with much higher density .",
    "the reading of such logarithmic color - map should be compared with its corresponding linear version in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , to conclude that the observed orbit tends to avoid the coordinate axes while visiting much more frequently the central maximum away from the origin .",
    "such behaviour is in clear opposition to the classic divergence of the pm density in the origin ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) ) and is reflected in the _ marginal _ distributions for the single coordinate @xmath46 for the pm2 map ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ) : a comparison with the corresponding distribution for a pm orbit with the same intermittency parameter shows that , while the 1d distribution diverges in the origin as @xmath37 , the 2d distributions for all @xmath64 have a maximum away from the origin ; this appears to move continuously toward @xmath15 as @xmath62 .",
    "this phenomenon is robust against different sizes of phase - space partition , proving that the effect of _ arbitrarily _ small couplings have a strong impact on both the dynamics and statistics of the system .",
    "even more interestingly , the location of the discontinuity lines in the pm2 phase - space densities can be computed _ analytically _ : in fig .  [",
    "fig:2](a ) , the solid and dashed curves are respectively the first and second iterates of the coordinate axes @xmath15 and @xmath68 , while all the remaining discontinuities are checked to be higher iterates of the same sets .",
    "this unexpected phenomenon is in agreement with the estimates of the lyapunov exponents from previous section : the fixed point in the origin @xmath55 is no more completely marginal , but has one negative lyapunov exponent which _ attracts _ the orbit toward the diagonal ; at the same time , we choose parameters for which the diagonal is instead _",
    "repelling_. this produces the net effect of enhancing the density in a region away from the origin , differently from the uncoupled and 1d case .",

    "@xcite for an early derivation of such a formula , based on escape rates from the indifferent fixed point ) .",
    "we may understand the @xmath57 behaviour by a qualitative argument as follows : if we consider return times on a _ strip _ @xmath109 $ ] then the statistics is determined by the single pm map for the variable @xmath46 , and so poincar recurrences @xmath110 are ruled by the exponent of the 1d map .",

    "our numerical results suggest , once again , that , at least asymptotically , _ any _ non - zero coupling induces instead uncorrelated behaviour on the two maps return probabilities .",
    "nevertheless the deviation from the uncoupled distribution ( thick - solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) ) takes place at longer return - times as the coupling parameter @xmath48 is reduced ( thin - curves in fig .",

    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and it was numerically tested on intermittent and hamiltonian systems in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since it is a less widely used technique with respect to scrutinizing the statistics of poincar recurrences , we briefly recall how it works operationally : for further details see ref .",
    "the crucial quantity to take into account is the probability distribution of finite - time lyapunov exponents @xmath125 ( leading expansion rates up to some fixed time @xmath76 ) which , for an ergodic system , collapses to a dirac delta in the @xmath126 limit .",
    "the idea  @xcite is that , by fixing a threshold @xmath127 ( @xmath128 being the asymptotic largest lyapunov exponent ) one can define : @xmath129 such that ( in a large deviation philosophy ) the way @xmath130 decays as @xmath126 should also rule the mixing speed .",
    "we underline that the important issue is that intermittent dynamics deeply modifies large deviations properties : the measure of point where birkhoff sums up to time @xmath76 are at least @xmath131 different from the asymptotic average is _ not _ exponentially vanishing as @xmath132 , but decays with a weaker power law , whose exponent coincide with the one ruling correlations decay .",

    "the procedure we follow here ( not knowing _ a priori _ the invariant measure ) is to follow a single trajectory for @xmath101 time steps and re - construct @xmath134 from @xmath135 consecutive chunks of trajectory : the threshold is then fixed depending on the goodness of the collected statistic . in fig .",
