    "planetary systems are formed in circumstellar disks around pre - main sequence stars .",
    "tidal interactions between the forming planets and the disk can result in complex substructures such as cavities , gaps , spirals , or lopsided rings @xcite .",
    "studying disks showing these features could provide us with critical information about the planetary formation process itself .",
    "in particular , transitional disks , which are protoplanetary disks with central dust gaps or cavities typically of tens of au in size @xcite , appear as excellent candidates to study the first stages of planetary formation .",
    "cavities in transitional disks were first identified through modeling of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) @xcite .",
    "this modeling also lead to the discovery of a subfamily of transitional disks , the so - called pre - transitional disks , which are thought to present a residual inner disk inside the cavity that can still emit significantly at near - ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "( sub-)mm and polarimetric ir observations have been able to image several of these disks and confirm the presence of the central cavities or gaps ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since their discovery ,",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain these inner clearings of dust ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , observations seem to indicate that most cavities in transitional disks are created by dynamical interactions with orbiting substellar or planetary companions @xcite .    until recent years",
    ", ( sub-)mm observations lacked the sensitivity and angular resolution necessary to reach distances very close to the central star . with the outstanding angular resolution provided by the most extended baselines of the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , as well as with the new capabilities of the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla )",
    ", it is now possible to attempt this type of studies . in particular",
    ", recent alma observations have revealed the presence of very small central cavities , few au in size , in some transitional disks ( e.g. , xz tau b : @xcite ; tw hya : @xcite ) . on the other hand , in a few cases it has been possible to detect compact central emission inside the cavity of transitional disks @xcite .",
    "this central emission has been associated with an inner disk ( emission either from dust or from photoionized gas ) or with an ionized jet .",
    "additionally , ( sub-)mm alma observations have also revealed the presence of several gaps and rings up to distances of @xmath7 au from the star in the protoplanetary disk around hl tau @xcite .",
    "these gaps , however , might have a different origin to those observed at the inner regions of transitional disks .",
    "the young age of hl tau , as well as the fact that some gaps are very narrow and appear at very long distances from the star , have lead to question whether a planet could produce this type of gaps .",
    "this has resulted in a number of studies proposing new physical processes that could create similar gap structures  e.g. zonal flows in magnetized disks @xcite , magneto - rotational instability at the dead zone outer edge @xcite , sintering - induced gaps and rings @xcite , or grain growth close to snowlines in the disk @xcite .",
    "gaps produced by these mechanisms could also be present in older protoplanetary and transitional disks , but they would have remained unnoticed in previous ( sub-)mm observations due to a lack of sensitivity and angular resolution .",
    "in fact , recent alma observations , with a similar angular resolution to the hl tau observations , have revealed the presence of similar ringed substructures in the transitional disk of tw hya @xcite and in the protoplanetary disk of hd 163296 @xcite .",

    "these authors also reproduced the sed and 7 mm radial intensity profile of hd 169142 with a disk model that included the central cavity and the outer gap .",
    "their results show that an inner residual disk is required to fit the sed and concluded that the disk of hd 169142 is a pre - transitional disk with two gaps .",
    "their results also suggested that planet formation is the most likely origin for both detected gaps .",
    "in fact , a substellar or planetary companion candidate has been detected within the inner gap of the disk @xcite , which supports a planet - induced origin for this gap .",
    "we note that most of the previous studies of hd 169142 adopted a distance of 145 pc @xcite .",

    "both limits are consistent with the model presented by @xcite .",
    "[ fig : maps ]    [ fig : maps2 ]      as can be seen in figure [ fig : maps ] , our 7 mm image shows a narrow ring of emission with a radius of @xmath2 au . for the width of the ring",
    "we estimate a deconvolved fwhm of @xmath45 au , measured along the e - w direction , where the synthesized beam size is smaller . the ring in our images coincides quite well with the ring imaged in previous near - ir @xcite , 7 mm @xcite , and 1.3 mm @xcite observations , but our images reveal additional details .",
    "we have estimated the position of the center of the ring by fitting an ellipse with its major axis along the position angle of the disk , as estimated from previous molecular observations ( pa@xmath46 ; @xcite ) , to the ring image , excluding the regions where two dips and a knot of emission are found ( see below ) . from this fit",
    "we estimate that the center of the ring in the 7 mm image ( epoch @xmath47 ) is located at @xmath48 , @xmath49 , which coincides within @xmath50 mas with the position of the star hd 169142 given in the gaia catalog , after correcting for proper motions @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the ring is very well centered on the star , and that the alignment of the data to make the final image , as well as the quality of its astrometry , are very good . from our fit",
    "we also estimate a radius of the ring of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 au ) , which is slightly larger than the radius of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 au ) estimated from the near - ir scattered light images ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the scattered light emission arises mainly from the inner rim or wall of the ring , whereas the 7 mm emission traces mainly the surface density of the large dust grains that peaks at slightly larger radii .",
    "the intensity of the ring in our 7 mm image is significantly asymmetric in azimuth , showing a knot of emission @xmath55 above the average intensity of the ring at pa@xmath56 , in agreement with the previous results of @xcite , who noted this azimuthal asymmetry from 7 mm data of lower angular resolution .",
    "we think that this knot represents a real azimuthal asymmetry since an intensity enhancement appears both in the images made from the new a configuration data alone as well as in the lower angular resolution maps reported in @xcite .",
    "the alma 1.3 mm images also show a hint of this asymmetry @xcite , although at a lower significance , probably due to the higher optical depth of the ring at shorter wavelengths , or an accumulation of the large dust grains preferentially traced at 7 mm .",
    "on the other hand , our new 7 mm image also shows significant decreases of intensity or dips in the ring at pa@xmath57 and pa@xmath58 . as shown by @xcite",
    ", an elongated beam can produce depressions of emission along the direction of the major axis of the beam in an axisymmetric ring .",
    "additionally , noise fluctuations can produce spurious clumpy structures during the deconvolution process . in order to check whether the substructure detected in our images is real or due to these spurious effects , we obtained simulated images with random thermal noise using the model presented by @xcite and the simobserve task in casa .",
    "these simulations showed that , for certain noise structures , intensity depressions similar to the ones in our observations could be formed in the narrow ring , suggesting that the observed dips in our 7 mm observations could be produced because of the combined effect of noise fluctuations and the elongated beam .",
    "nevertheless , none of our simulations produced a bright knot similiar to the one detected in our 7 mm observations , indicating that it is tracing a real azimuthal asymmetry in the ring .",
    "polarized scattered light images at _ h _ band show an axisymmetric ring with only a possible dip at a pa@xmath59 @xcite , where no significant drop of emission is seen in our images .",
    "the fact that the knot of emission in the ring is not present at near - ir wavelengths indicates that it is probably produced by azimuthal asymmetries in the density near the disk mid - plane , to which our 7 mm images are more sensitive , without affecting significantly the distribution of small dust grains in the disk atmosphere , which are traced by the scattered light images .",
    "azimuthal asymmetries in the large dust grains distribution are expected to be produced by tidal interactions between a forming planet and the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations show that planets can create relatively large cavities with vortices at their outer edges .",
    "these vortices , in turn , are able to trap the large dust grains in their pressure maxima , producing lopsided asymmetries at mm wavelengths @xcite . thus , the interaction between the disk of hd 169142 and the possible forming planets at the inner @xcite and second gaps could be responsible for the observed non - axisymmetric structure .",
    "our 7 mm , 9 mm , and 3 cm images have revealed the presence of compact emission inside the bright emission ring , originating near its center ( figs .",
    "[ fig : maps ] and [ fig : maps2 ] ) .",
    "the emission at 7 mm is slightly extended along the e - w direction , with its intensity peak at a projected distance of @xmath60 au ( @xmath61 ) from the central star toward the w direction .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is probably only a lower limit , corresponding to the formal error in the position of the emission peak relative to the center of the ring , estimated as @xmath62 @xcite , assuming an unresolved source ( @xmath63 ) and a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 5 .",
    "further observations are needed to confirm the reality and origin of this possible displacement ( see below ) .",
    "the insufficient sensitivity and angular resolution of the images at 9 mm and 3 cm , respectively , make it difficult to estimate the morphology of the central emission observed at these wavelengths .",
    "this central radio source could not be detected in previous observations by @xcite toward hd 169142 at 7 mm due to the lack of angular resolution .",
    "we do not identify radio emission associated with the ir source detected by @xcite and @xcite located @xmath190.16@xmath35 ( @xmath1919 au ) north from the central star .    in principle",
    ", both dust and ionized gas could be contributing to the radio emission at the innermost regions of transitional disks . to our knowledge",
    ", very few transitional disks have been observed with high enough angular resolution to detect and resolve compact emission at mm and cm wavelengths inside their central cavities or gaps .",
    "lkca 15 @xcite and ab aur @xcite were imaged with the vla at 7 mm and 3 cm , respectively , whereas tw hya was observed with alma at 0.87 mm @xcite .",
    "the emission in tw hya has been attributed to inner residual dust located close to the star , although it has also been recently suggested that a contribution of free - free emission from photoionized gas could be present @xcite .",
    "the morphology and spectral index of the emission in ab aur indicates that it is associated with free - free emission from an accretion - driven jet . in lkca 15",
    ", however , the lack of observations at other wavelengths makes it impossible to distinguish between a dust or a free - free origin for the emission . in the following we discuss the origin of the observed compact central radio source in hd 169142 .",
    "the near - ir excess in the sed of hd 169142 indicates that its disk is a pre - transitional disk , with a hot dust component located very close to the star .",
    "@xcite modeled the broadband sed as well as the 7 mm images of hd 169142 and found that an inner disk of 0.6 au in radius , together with its inner wall at the dust sublimation radius ( @xmath64 au ) , could fit the near - ir emission of hd 169142 . according to their model , this inner dust component would produce only @xmath65jy , @xmath66jy and @xmath67jy of emission at 7 mm , 9 mm , and 3 cm , respectively .",
    "these values are much lower than the observed @xmath34jy , @xmath38jy and @xmath40jy at these wavelengths for the central radio source . from a power - law fit to these observed values of the flux density ( @xmath68 ) , we estimate a spectral index @xmath69 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sed ] ) , which is too low to correspond to dust thermal emission ( dust thermal emission presents @xmath70 ) .",
    "therefore , both the flux density and spectral index of the central radio source indicate that its emission is mainly dominated by partially optically - thick free - free emission from ionized gas .",
    "[ fig : sed ]    gas near young stellar objects has been found to be ionized by two main mechanisms : shocks in accretion - driven jets @xcite , and photoionization due to the high energy radiation from the central star @xcite . since accretion and ejection of material are correlated @xcite , low mass - accretion rate objects , such as transitional disks , are expected to present relatively weak radio jets .",
    "however , recent studies with the vla have shown that radio jets in this type of sources can produce free - free emission at levels that are detectable with the improved sensitivity of the vla @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite presented vla observations at 3 cm toward the transitional disk of gm aur revealing resolved free - free emission from a radio jet and from a photoevaporating disk , showing that both mechanisms can contribute at the same level to the total free - free emission .",
    "the central radio source detected at 7 mm in hd 169142 presents a slight elongation with a pa@xmath71 , which is consistent with the position angle of the disk rotation axis ( pa@xmath72 ) , as shown by molecular line observations @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the central radio source in our images could be tracing an accretion - driven radio jet . we can obtain a rough estimate of the free - free emission of an accretion - driven jet in hd 169142 with the empirical correlation between the radio luminosity of a source , @xmath73 , and its outflow momentum rate , @xmath74 ( @xcite ) : @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite measured a mass accretion rate onto the star hd 169142 of @xmath76@xmath77 . assuming a ratio between mass loss rate in jets and mass accretion rate @xmath78 @xcite",
    ", we estimate that the outflow momentum rate should be @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the correlation would predict a flux density at 3 cm @xmath80jy , which is lower than our estimated flux density of @xmath81jy for the central radio source . even though this estimate has large uncertainties",
    ", it suggests that an additional mechanism other than shocks associated with the outflow could contribute to the ionization of this jet .",
    "another possibility is that the observed central radio source was originated as a result of photoionization by high energy radiation from the central star .",
    "extreme - uv ( euv ) and , to a lesser extent , x - rays radiation impinging on the inner disk can ionize its surface @xcite and contribute to the observed free - free emission .",
    "an inhomogeneous inner disk could lead to an inhomogeneous irradiation of its surface , which could result in the asymmetric morphology of the central radio source observed at 7 mm .",
    "additionally , the ejected gas in the accretion - driven jet could also be significantly photoionized by the high - energy radiation emitted by the star @xcite .",
    "finally , the peak of emission of the central radio source could be tracing the position of an independent object at a radius of @xmath82 au from the central star .",
    "given the proximity to the central star , the dynamical timescales involved would be short .",
    "an orbiting object at a radius of @xmath83 au would have an orbital period @xmath844 yr , and would show detectable orbital proper motions in a few months . on the other hand ,",
    "knots of emission in a radio jet are expected to be ejected with velocities of @xmath19300 km  s@xmath22 .",
    "given the small inclination angle of the disk ( @xmath85 , @xcite ) , after projection on the plane - of - the sky , this would result in proper motions of @xmath86 yr@xmath22 away from the central star along pa @xmath87 .",
    "future observations should reveal detectable variations and/or proper motions in the observed emission that will allow us to discriminate whether it traces material ejected from the central star ( jet ) or orbiting around it ( disk or independent object ) .      in order to improve the signal to noise ratio of the detected intensity",
    ", we have obtained the averaged radial intensity profiles of the 7 and 9 mm images ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "these profiles were produced by averaging the intensity within concentric elliptical rings , matching the inclination and position angle of the disk major axis determined by previous molecular line observations ( @xmath85 , and pa@xmath46 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the width of the concentric rings was set to the size of the beam , since the rms noise at spatial scales smaller than a beam is not independent .",
    "[ fig : profiles ]    besides the inner gap ( hereafter g1 ) , two other gaps at radii @xmath88 ( @xmath3 au ; g2 ) and @xmath89 ( @xmath4 au ; g3 ) are revealed at both 7 mm and 9 mm .",
    "the inner ( g1 ) and second gaps ( g2 ) were already detected at near - ir wavelengths ( with g1 at radii @xmath90 and g2 extending from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ; @xcite ) , at 7 mm @xcite , and at 1.3 mm @xcite .",
    "our observations detect the g1 and g2 gaps at the same radii than precedent studies , while the g3 gap is reported here for the first time .",
    "we point out that a sharp cutoff in the _ uv _ coverage of the observations can result in the creation of a spurious annular structure during the deconvolution process .",
    "however , this artifact would appear at different radii in the images at different frequencies , whereas the g3 gap appears at the same radius in our observations at 7 and 9 mm .",
    "additionally , our simulated images ( see  [ subsec : ring ] ) do not show the presence of spurious features mimicking the g3 gap when an actual gap is not included in the model .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the g3 gap is probably a real annular gap in the disk of hd 169142 .",
    "we note , however , that the g3 gap is not visible in the alma 1.3 mm images @xcite .",
    "this could indicate that the g3 gap is more prominent in the distribution of the cm - sized dust grains traced by our vla observations .    as mentioned above",
    ", different studies have proposed that g1 and g2 are probably formed because of dynamical interactions between the disk and forming planets within each gap @xcite . however , the origin of the third gap ( g3 ) is more difficult to understand .",
    "detection of gaps at such large distances , like g3 , is very difficult .",
    "so far , similar gaps have only been detected in the protoplanetary disks around hl tau @xcite , tw hya @xcite , and hd 163296 @xcite , through recent extremely high angular resolution alma observations .",
    "the density in the disk mid - plane at such large distances is probably too low to create a planet responsible for clearing the observed gap .",
    "alternatively , the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) in magnetized disks can produce pressure bumps at the outer edges of the dead zones in the disk , which can in turn trap the large dust grains and create gaps in the mm emission of the disk @xcite . however , dead zones are expected to be closer to the central star ( at radii @xmath91 au ) , so models do not predict gaps as far as the observed g3 gap in hd 169142 .    another possible origin for g3 would be grain growth and/or an increase in the solids surface density close to condensation fronts ( i.e. snowlines ) of volatiles in the disk . this process has been suggested as the responsible for some of the rings and gaps that were detected by alma in the disk around the younger t tauri star hl tau @xcite .",
    "models and laboratory experiments suggest that dust grains can grow significantly when surrounded by an icy mantle , which would form on the surface of the grains beyond these snowlines ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , it has been suggested that the enhanced surface density of solids beyond the snowline can produce viscosity gradients and pressure bumps because of a reduction in the column depth of the mri - active layer .",
    "these pressure bumps could in turn trap the large dust grains @xcite , although more recent studies have found that , at least for the water snowline , which is located at much smaller radii , the viscosity gradient would need to be unrealistically high to be able to form a dust trap @xcite .",
    "based on the composition of comets , the most abundant volatiles in protoplanetary disks are thought to be water , co , and co@xmath92 .",
    "these molecules have , for typical disk mid - plane densities , condensation temperatures of 128155 k , 2328 k , and 6072 k , respectively @xcite .",
    "comparing these temperatures with the mid - plane temperatures obtained from the model presented by @xcite , we find that the water and co@xmath92 snowlines would fall inside g1 , while the co snowline would be located at a distance of @xmath93@xmath94 au larger than the recent distance of 117 pc measured by gaia",
    ". however , we do not expect important changes in the physical structure of the disk . ] .",
    "the lower end of the range of radii for the co snowline is coincident with the outer edge of g3 , favoring grain growth and an increase in the solids surface density close to the co snowline as a possible mechanism to explain the origin of the g3 gap .",
    "an independent measurement of the position of the co snowline in protoplanetary disks can be obtained through observations of molecules whose chemistry is sensitive to the co @xcite .",
    "one of these molecules is the dco@xmath5 , which is expected to form mainly in the regions of protoplanetary disks where gas - phase co and low temperatures ( t@xmath95 k ) coexist . because of this",
    ", the dco@xmath5 emission has been used as a tracer of the co freeze - out in disks , showing a ring - like morphology peaking at just a slightly smaller radius than the co snowline @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies suggest that , in some cases , the dco@xmath5 molecule might have a more complex relationship with the co snowline , and that optically thin co isotopologues such as c@xmath6o could represent better tracers by showing a decrease of emission at the radius of the snowline @xcite .    in order to estimate the position of the co snowline in hd 169142 , we have analyzed alma archival observations of both the dco@xmath5(3 - 2 ) and c@xmath6o(2 - 1 ) molecular transitions .",
    "an image of the velocity - integrated dco@xmath5(3 - 2 ) emission is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dco ] , whereas the c@xmath6o(2 - 1 ) images are reported by @xcite .",
    "we have obtained averaged radial profiles of the velocity - integrated emission for both transitions following the same procedures as for the continuum emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gas_profiles ] ) .",
    "the image of the dco@xmath5(3 - 2 ) emission shows a ring morphology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dco ] ) with radius @xmath96 ( @xmath97 au ) , as it is clearly seen in the radial profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gas_profiles ] . additionally , the c@xmath6o(2 - 1 ) emission shows a significant change of slope in its radial profile at @xmath98 ( @xmath99 au ) , indicating a decrease of the gas - phase co beyond this radius .",
    "thus , both molecular transitions indicate that the co snowline is located at @xmath99 au in the disk of hd 169142 , very close to the g3 gap and in the range of distances estimated with the @xcite model .",
    "[ fig : dco ]    [ fig : gas_profiles ]    these results suggest that the g3 gap might be produced because of an accumulation of large dust grains at the position of the co snowline .",
    "large grains could grow and accumulate close to the co snowline , creating a ring of emission at long wavelengths next to an inner zone with a lower density of large grains , resulting in the observed gap in the 7 mm emission of the disk . as noted above",
    ", the 1.3 mm emission of the disk does not show the presence of g3 gap @xcite , which could indicate that the larger ( @xmath100cm - sized ) dust grains are being trapped in the co snowline @xcite , whereas the smaller ( @xmath19 submm / mm - sized ) grains traced by the 1.3 mm emission have continued their inward migration .",
    "further studies , including both modeling and observations , are needed to fully understand the possible changes in the disk appearance with the observing wavelength .    therefore ,",
    "even though we can not completely discard a magnetically induced or planet - induced origin , we favor dust growth and accumulation of large dust grains close to the co snowline as the most likely mechanism responsible for the proposed g3 gap in hd 169142 .",
    "we have presented new high angular resolution vla observations at 7 mm , 9 mm , and 3 cm toward the pre - transitional disk around hd 169142 .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * our 7 and 9 mm observations show a narrow ( @xmath45 au in width ) azimuthally asymmetric ring of emission of radius @xmath2 au , apparently tracing the outer rim of the innermost gap .",
    "the radius of the ring is consistent with that of previous 7 mm and near - ir polarized scattered light images @xcite .",
    "a bright knot of emission in the ring is revealed at 7 mm .",
    "this knot of emission is not present in the near - ir images , indicating that it is probably tracing an azimuthal asymmetry in the density of the disk mid - plane , to which our 7 mm images are more sensitive .",
    "we interpret this asymmetry as probably produced by tidal interactions between the disk and forming planets . * a central component of emission",
    "is detected inside the inner gap at 7 mm , 9 mm , and 3 cm .",
    "the 7 mm source shows a slightly elongated morphology approximately along the e - w direction , with its peak of emission displaced a projected distance of @xmath82 au ( @xmath101 ) to the west of the central star .",
    "the flux density and spectral index of this central radio source indicate that it is dominated by free - free emission from ionized gas , which could be associated with an inhomogeneous photoionization of the inner disk , with an independent orbiting object , or with an ( asymmetric ) ionized jet .",
    "although data currently available seem to favor the latter scenario , future observations should reveal significant proper motions either away or around the central star that will allow us to discriminate between ejection or orbital motions . *",
    "the radial intensity profiles of the 7 and 9 mm images reveal the presence of multiple gaps in the disk of hd 169142 .",
    "our 7 and 9 mm observations not only confirm the presence of the previously reported inner ( g1 ) and second ( g2 ) gaps , which approximately extend through radii @xmath19025 au and @xmath193256 au , respectively , but also detect , for the first time , a new gap comprising the radii @xmath197796 au ( g3 ) .",
    "this proposed gap , one of the farthest gaps ever detected in a protoplanetary disk , is not detected in alma 1.3 mm images , suggesting that it might be more prominent in the distribution of the larger dust grains traced by our vla observations . * our analysis of dco@xmath5(3 - 2 ) and c@xmath6o(2 - 1 ) alma observations , as well as the results of the @xcite model ,",
    "indicate that the co snowline is located at @xmath99 au .",
    "this suggests that dust grain growth and an increase in the solids surface density close to the co snowline could be the mechanism responsible for the origin of the proposed g3 outer gap .",
