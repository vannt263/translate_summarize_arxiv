    "the identification of dromions which are exponentially localized solutions in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional soliton equations [ 1 - 6 ] has been one of the most interesting developments in soliton theory in recent times , which has given a fillip to the understanding of integrable systems in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "essentially , these localized solutions arise due to the presence of some additional nonlocal terms or effective local fields associated with `` boundaries '' .",
    "further , the advent of `` explode decay dromions '' which are again exponentially localized solutions with time varying amplitudes [ 7 ] and induced dromions [ 6,8 ] using arbitrary functions of space and time variables have set in motion the process of unearthing more and more novel localized entities in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional nonlinear systems .",
    "an interesting evolution equation in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions which we consider here is the one proposed by melnikov [ 9,10 ] that describes ( under certain conditions ) the interaction of two waves on the x - axis .",
    "this equation is of the form    @xmath0_{x } = 0 , \\\\",
    "i\\chi_{t } = u\\chi+\\chi_{xx},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the long wave amplitude ( real ) , @xmath2 is the complex short wave envelope , and the parameter @xmath3 satisfies the condition @xmath4 = 1 .",
    "( 1 ) may be considered either as a generalization of the k - p equation with the addition of a complex scalar field or as a generalization of the nls equation with a real scalar field ( after suitable interchange of coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . melnikov",
    "[ 10 ] has pointed out that eq .",
    "( 1 ) admits boomeron type solutions , which can be realized from an asymptotic analysis of the two soliton solution .",
    "it is expected that the investigation of this equation may have wider ramifications in plasma physics , nonlinear optics and hydrodynamics .",
    "it is this diverse presence of this equation which prompts one to make a detailed investigation of their dynamics , particularly to identify whether localized solutions exist in this system . for this purpose ,",
    "we first carry out a painlev singularity structure analysis and confirm that eq .",
    "( 1 ) does indeed satisfy the painlev property . then bilinearizing the evolution equation and making use of certain arbitrary functions present in the solution",
    ", we obtain a large class of exponentially localized dromion solutions .",
    "we explore the singularity structure of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , by rewriting @xmath2=a and @xmath7=b as    @xmath8    we now effect a local laurent expansion in the neighbourhood of a noncharacteristic singular manifold @xmath9 = 0 , @xmath10 0 , @xmath11 0 . assuming the leading orders of the solutions of eq . ( 2 ) to have the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are analytic functions of ( @xmath16 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are integers to be determined , we now substitute ( 3 ) into ( 2 ) and balance the most dominant terms to get @xmath20 with the condition @xmath21 now , considering the generalized laurent expansion of the solutions in the neighbourhood of the singular manifold    @xmath22    the resonances ( powers ) at which arbitrary functions enter into ( 6 ) can be determined by substituting ( 6 ) into ( 2 ) and comparing the coefficients of ( @xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath24 ) to give @xmath25 where @xmath26 . solving eq . ( 7 ) , one gets the resonance values as @xmath27    the resonance at @xmath28 = -1 naturally represents the arbitrariness of the manifold @xmath29 . in order to prove the existence of arbitrary functions at the other resonance values , we now substitute the full laurent series    @xmath30    into eq .",
    "( 2 ) . now collecting the coefficients of ( @xmath31,@xmath32,@xmath32 ) and solving them",
    ", we obtain the relations ( 5 ) , implying a resonance at @xmath28 = 0 .    similarly collecting the following coefficients",
    ", we obtain the necessary information about the positive resonances :    \\(i ) coefficients of ( @xmath33,@xmath34,@xmath34 ) : @xmath35    \\(ii ) coefficients of ( @xmath32,@xmath36,@xmath36 ) : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 can be uniquely determined .",
    "\\(iii ) coefficients of ( @xmath34,@xmath40,@xmath40 ) : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 can be uniquely determined .",
    "\\(iv ) coefficients of ( @xmath36,@xmath44,@xmath44 ) : only two equations result for three unknowns @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and so one of them is arbitrary , corresponding to a resonance at @xmath28 = 4 .",
    "\\(v ) coefficients of ( @xmath40,@xmath48,@xmath48 ) : only @xmath49 is determined , while @xmath50 and @xmath51 are arbitrary corresponding to double resonance at @xmath28 = ( 5 , 5 ) .",
    "\\(vi ) coefficients of ( @xmath44,@xmath52,@xmath52 ) : only two equations result for three unknowns @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and so one of them is arbitrary , corresponding to @xmath28 = 6 .",

    ", we demand that both the solution of melnikov eq .",
    "( 2 ) and the solution close to it represented by a peturbation series in a small parameter @xmath64 are free from movable critical manifolds .",
    "we identify that the first order peturbed series does admit an arbitrary function corresponding to a movable pole at the resonance @xmath28 = -3 .",
    "consequently , for each of the eight resonances given by eq .",
    "( 8) , one can associate an arbitrary function in the solution ( and close to it ) without the introduction of movable critical manifolds .",
    "it must be mentioned that the above system ( 2 ) admits another leading order behaviour with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are arbitrary .",
    "the laurent series with the above leading order leads to resonances @xmath68 , corresponding to a normal branch and the existence of sufficient number of arbitrary functions can be established at these resonance values .",
    "this can also be verified from the corresponding bilinear form as studied by grammaticos , ramani and hietarinta [ 12 ] .",
    "consequently one can be assured that the melnikov equation ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) indeed satisfies the painlev property .",
    "we next hitora bilinearize the melnikov eq .",
    "( 1 ) to bring out the existence of exponentially localized solutions of melnikov equation . making the transformation",
    "@xmath69    identifiable from the painlev analysis , eq .",
    "( 1 ) gets converted into the following hirota bilinear form ,    @xmath70    where the @xmath71 s are the usual bilinear operators .",
    "however , this bilinearization have been already done by y. hase etal [ 13 ] where they have given soliton solutions whereas we have brought out localised solutions here . for a completion ,",
    "we proceed as follows . introducing the series expansion ,    @xmath72    into the above bilinear form and gathering terms with various powers of the small parameter @xmath64 , we obtain the following set of equations ,    @xmath73    etc . solving eq .",
    "( 14a ) , we can immediately write down the following solution , @xmath74 where the spectral parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 are all complex . confining to @xmath77 = 1 in eq .",
    "( 15 ) and substituting ( 15 ) into ( 14b ) , we obtain @xmath78 here @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 and also @xmath82 . choosing @xmath83 , for @xmath84 @xmath85 1 , in eq .",
    "( 13 ) and using eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) alongwith the transformation ( 11 ) , the physical field @xmath1 and the potential @xmath2 can be easily seen to be driven by the envelope soliton and pulse soliton respectively as    @xmath86    where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "one can proceed further in the standard way to obtain higher order soliton solutions also .",
    "looking at the above solutions ( 17 ) , we realize the fact that as the parameter @xmath89 @xmath90 0 , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 vanish .",
    "but , when @xmath91 @xmath90 @xmath92 , the potential @xmath2 vanishes , whereas the physical field @xmath1 survives and is driven by a ghost soliton of the form , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a new constant .",
    "this predicts the existence of exponentially localized solution for the complex field variable @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) .      to generate a ( 1,1 ) dromion",
    ", we now make the ansatz @xmath95 where    @xmath96    here @xmath97 is a real constant and @xmath98 and @xmath99 are complex constants . substituting ( 19 ) in ( 12a ) , we obtain    @xmath100    for the parametric choice @xmath101 . substituting ( 19 ) and ( 21 ) in ( 12b ) , we find that @xmath102 , where @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the real and imaginary parts , respectively of @xmath106 .",
    "hence , the exponentially localized solution with one bound state for the potential field @xmath2 for the above choice of @xmath107 and @xmath106 takes the form @xmath108 while the scalar field has the form @xmath109 which is always bounded , but localized everywhere except in the neighbourhood of the line @xmath110 in the @xmath111 plane . a snapshot of        the ( 1,1 ) dromion solution for the magnitude of the potential field @xmath2 is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "one can proceed to find multi - dromion solutions also , generalizing the above ( 1,1 ) dromions .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( 14a ) that the differential equation for @xmath112 involves only the variables @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "hence , an arbitrary function of @xmath5 can also enter into its solution so that the most general form of it can be given as @xmath113 where @xmath114s are arbitrary functions of @xmath5 .",
    "this fact can be harnessed in a suitable way to construct a more general class of localized solutions .",
    "following the above procedure to derive the ( 1,1 ) dromion solution ( 22 ) , one can easily obtain the generalized dromion solution involving arbitrary function of @xmath5 in the same form as eq .",
    "( 22 ) except that @xmath115 is now given by @xmath116 instead of ( 20b ) , where the arbitrary function @xmath117 is in general complex .",
    "the amplitude of the localized solution with arbitrary function of @xmath5 is now defined by the equation @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the derivative of the real part of @xmath120 with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the amplitude of the above localized solution varies with the spatial coordinate @xmath5 by virtue of eq .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the explode - decay dromion of the variable coefficient dsi equation [ 7 ] where the amplitude varies with time .",
    "it should be mentioned that , to our knowledge this is the first time the amplitude of a localized solution of a ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation has been found to vary as a function of the spatial coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "this can be easily generalized to multi - dromions with spatially varying amplitude .",
    "we also wish to point out that the existence of an arbitrary function in the solution of @xmath121 in eq .",
    "( 14a ) can be further utilized to obtain new induced dromion solutions [ 6 ] for @xmath2 .",
    "for example , eqs .",
    "( 14a ) and ( 14b ) can also be solved in terms of arbitrary functions as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is an arbitrary complex function of @xmath5 and @xmath124 and @xmath125 are complex constants constrained by the condition @xmath82 . substituting the form ( 27 ) into ( 14b ) and solving the resultant equation , we obtain @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a real function of @xmath5 and is given by the condition @xmath128 the above solutions can then be used to generate curved line soliton for the field variable and the potential as    @xmath129,\\\\ u & = & 2l_{1r}^2\\mbox{sech}^2[\\hat{\\psi_{1r}}+{1\\over{2}}\\mbox{log}b(y ) ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the real and imaginary parts , repectively of @xmath132 .",
    "thus , by choosing the arbitrary functions @xmath123 and @xmath127 suitably which are constrained by the eq . ( 29 ) , one can induce localized solutions for the field variable @xmath2 as in the case of zakharov - strachan equation [ 6 ] .",
    "eventhough there exists two functions @xmath123 and @xmath127 , only one of them is found to be arbitrary , which is evident from the eq .",
    "( 29 ) above .",
    "for example , by choosing @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a real constant , we can find from eq .",
    "( 29 ) that @xmath135 then we obtain the induced localized solution @xmath136.\\ ] ]    thus , by choosing @xmath123 and @xmath127 suitably , one can induce a wide class of localized solutions for the melnikov eq .",
    "( 1 ) . for example , choosing an algebraic form @xmath137 we obtain an algebraically decaying localized solution @xmath138.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can as well generalize this procedure to construct even wider class of localized solutions .",
    "in fact , multi - induced dromions take the simple form @xmath139 e^{i\\hat{\\psi_{1i}}}\\mbox{sech}[\\hat{\\psi_{1r}}+{1\\over{2}}\\mbox{log}b(y)],\\ ] ] where @xmath140 , @xmath141 are arbitrary functions of @xmath5 and they are related to @xmath127 by the relation @xmath142 note that the sum of the arbitrary functions of @xmath5 on the right hand side of eq.(36 ) becomes possible due to the structure of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) . in practice one can choose @xmath143 conveniently , for example , as a combination of algebraic and hyperbolic functions . with n=2 , choosing the functions as @xmath144 where @xmath134 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are parameters , solving eq.(29 )",
    ", one can obtain @xmath148 then , the induced two dromion solution is given by @xmath149\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and is shown in fig .",
    "2 . one can identify the mutual influence of one dromion over the other from the additional terms occurring in the square bracket of eq .",
    "( 40 ) .",
    "if one chooses both the functions @xmath140 , @xmath150 , algebraically , @xmath151 or one of the functions to be algebraic and the other one to be hypebolic @xmath152 one can generate different kinds of induced lump - lump or dromion - lump solutions , respectively .",
    "we have also tried to generate more general two soliton solutions by choosing @xmath153 which lead to a condition @xmath154 thereby reducing to our original form ( 36 ) for @xmath155 .",
    "this is also true for @xmath156 .",
    "thus we believe that the solution ( 36 ) constitutes the most general localized solution we could construct for the melnikov equation through our procedure .",
