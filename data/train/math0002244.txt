    "schtzenberger s theory of jeu de taquin  @xcite and the insertion procedure of schensted  @xcite have found their way into the standard toolkit of the combinatorial representation theorist .",
    "these algorithms were originally developed for tableaux of partition shape , but more recent work  @xcite uses them to define operations on pairs of skew tableaux . a striking duality between schensted insertion and schtzenberger s jeu",
    "de taquin was noted by stembridge  @xcite in his theory of rational tableaux .",
    "we introduce the involutive tableau operation of complementation to formalise this duality , showing that internal row insertion and the jeu de taquin give complementary operations on pairs of tableaux .",
    "this is readily seen using the growth diagram formulation for operations on tableaux introduced by fomin  @xcite and rediscovered several times , most notably by van leeuwen  @xcite .",
    "column insertion  @xcite is another tableau algorithm that can be extended to define the operation of internal column insertion between pairs of tableaux .",
    "the operation hopscotch which is complementary to internal column insertion is new , although it extends both stroomer s algorithm of column - sliding  @xcite and tesler s  @xcite rightward- and leftward - shift games .",
    "these four operations of jeu de taquin , internal row insertion , internal column insertion , and hopscotch all preserve knuth - equivalence .",
    "a consequence is that hopscotch gives rise to new algorithms to rectify tableaux .",
    "we also show that these four operations have the same dual - equivalence theory .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ tableaux ] recalls basic definitions and terminology concerning tableaux , the jeu de taquin , and knuth equivalence . in section  [ complementation ]",
    "we introduce complementation and determine its behaviour with respect to knuth equivalence and dual equivalence .",
    "section  [ lr ] is devoted to operations on pairs of tableaux given by growth diagrams constructed from local rules , and introduces the notion of complementary operations on pairs of tableaux . in section [ ir ]",
    "we show that the two operations of jeu de taquin and internal row insertion are complementary . in section [ gnu ]",
    "we define internal column insertion and its complementary operation hopscotch , and in section 6 , we investigate some features of hopscotch . finally , in section 7 , we supplement the jeu de taquin , describing four additional algorithms to rectify skew tableaux .",
    "the first three are not well - known , while the fourth is new .",
    "schematically , the four operations of jeu de taquin , internal row insertion , internal column insertion , and hopscotch are linked through complementation and conjugation as follows : @xmath0",
    "the tableaux operations of internal row insertion , internal column insertion , and hopscotch require us to extend the usual notion of tableaux .",
    "while these operations are defined on a class of more general tableaux , we show in section 7 how they provide new algorithms for ordinary tableaux . rather than give a common generalisation , we instead give a definition that will suffice until section  [ gnu ] , where we will be precise about necessary further extensions to our notion of tableau .",
    "a partition @xmath1 is a weakly decreasing sequence of positive integers @xmath2 indexed by an interval @xmath3 of integers .",
    "the shape of a partition @xmath1 is a left justified array of boxes whose @xmath4th row contains @xmath5 boxes .",
    "we make no distinction between a partition and its shape .",
    "thus we identify partitions that differ only in their number of trailing zeroes .",
    "partitions are partially ordered @xmath6 by componentwise comparison of sequences .",

    "a _ tableau _ @xmath13 with shape @xmath8 and entries from the alphabet @xmath14:=\\{1,\\ldots , k\\}$ ] is a chain @xmath15 , where the successive skew shapes @xmath16 are horizontal strips .",
    "the _ content _ of @xmath13 is the sequence whose @xmath4th component is the number of boxes in the horizontal strip @xmath16 . filling the boxes of @xmath16 with",
    "the integer @xmath4 shows this is equivalent to the usual definition of a column - strict tableau .",
    "we represent tableaux both as chains and as fillings of a shape with a totally ordered alphabet ( in practice , the positive integers or roman alphabet ) .",
    "for example , the chain and the filling of the shape @xmath17 below both represent the same tableau . @xmath18    a tableau is _ standard _ if each @xmath16 consists of a single box , so that the chain is saturated . in this case , we say @xmath19 is a _",
    "cover_. many ( but not all ) of our tableaux algorithms may be computed via the _ standard renumbering _ of a tableau @xmath13 .",
    "the standard renumbering of @xmath13 is the refinement of the chain representing @xmath13 where each horizontal strip is filled in ` left - to - right ' .",
    "for example , here is the standard renumbering of the tableau above .",
    "@xmath20    let @xmath11 be partitions .",

    "@xcite is a specific reversible procedure that , given a tableau @xmath13 and an inner corner @xmath22 of the shape of @xmath13 , moves @xmath22 through @xmath13 , producing a new tableau together with an outer corner .",
    "it proceeds by successively interchanging the empty box @xmath22 with one of its neighbours to the right or below in such a way that at every step the figure has increasing columns and weakly increasing rows . when the box has neighbours both right and below it moves as indicated : @xmath24 when the box has only a single such neighbour , it interchanges with that neighbour , and the slide concludes when the box has no neighbours .",
    "the reverse of this procedure is also called a jeu de taquin slide .",
    "schtzenberger s jeu de taquin is the procedure that , given a tableau @xmath25 , applies jeu de taquin slides beginning at inner corners of @xmath25 , and concludes when there are no more such corners .",
    "schtzenberger proves  @xcite that the result , which we call the _ rectification _ of @xmath25 , is independent of choices of inner corners .",
    "a tableau @xmath26 _ extends _ another tableau @xmath13 if the shape of @xmath26 extends the shape of @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath13 is a tableau extended by @xmath26 , then the standard renumbering of @xmath13 gives a set of instructions for applying jeu de taquin slides to @xmath26 : the last cover of @xmath13 is an inner corner of @xmath26 , and after applying the slide beginning with that corner , the next slide begins at the new inner corner given by the next to last cover of @xmath13 , and so on .",
    "write @xmath27 for the resulting tableau",
    ". one could consider the sequence of outer corners obtained from this procedure as a tableau @xmath25 or regard @xmath26 as a set of instructions for slides on @xmath13 ; these both produce the same tableau  @xcite ( up to standard renumbering ) .",

    "two fundamental equivalence relations among tableaux are knuth equivalence and dual equivalence .",
    "we call two tableaux @xmath13 and @xmath26 _ knuth - equivalent _ if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of jeu de taquin slides .",
    "( this is equivalent to their reading words being knuth - equivalent in the standard sense  @xcite . )",
    "two tableaux @xmath13 and @xmath26 with the same shape are _ dual equivalent _ if applying the same sequence of jeu de taquin slides to @xmath13 and to @xmath26 always gives tableaux of the same shape .",
    "these are related by a result of haiman  @xcite : the intersection of any knuth - equivalence class and any dual - equivalence class is either empty or consists of a unique tableau .",

    "this figure also illustrates the fact that if some columns of @xmath13 are empty ( for instance , if @xmath45 ) , then the corresponding columns of @xmath35 will consist of the full set @xmath14 $ ] . if we identify tableaux which differ by a vertical shift , we may also write the columns of @xmath35 above the corresponding columns of @xmath13 .",
