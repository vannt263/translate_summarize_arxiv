    "the development of spintronics devices @xcite has motivated a large body of research on diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite with the ultimate aim of creating materials with curie temperatures ( @xmath7 ) above room temperature .",
    "this ambitious goal can only be achieved by a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the behavior of currently available dms .",
    "most theoretical approaches to study these materials start with one of two extreme regimes : _",
    "( i ) _ the limit of high mn doping in which holes are directly doped into the valence band and , thus , are uniformly distributed in the sample ( vb scenario ) @xcite and _ ( ii ) _ the limit of very low mn doping in which holes are electrically bound to the impurity cores and an impurity band develops due to wave function overlap as the number of holes increases ( ib scenario).@xcite researchers using the vb limit claim that it is valid for all the relevant dopings , namely @xmath0@xmath8@xmath9 in ga@xmath10mn@xmath11as , and some experimental results support their view.@xcite however , a similar claim is advanced by the groups promoting the ib scenario , i.e. that the ib exists up to the largest value of @xmath0 that has been reached experimentally ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this view also appears supported by the analysis of some experimental data.@xcite    to solve this apparent puzzle , it is very important to study theoretically the dms problem using unbiased techniques that provide reliable estimations for the value of @xmath0 where the ib to vb crossover takes place .",
    "such unbiased approaches could be provided by numerical techniques : in fact , the mc and dmft methods have already been applied to a variety of phenomenological models for the dms.@xcite these previous studies have been able to determine a crossover between the vb and ib behaviors , but only as a function of increasing values of the @xmath1-@xmath2 exchange @xmath3 . however , most experimental results appear to indicate that the realistic @xmath3 for ( ga , mn)as is approximately 1  ev,@xcite which corresponds to the weak coupling regime in which no ib is generated by @xmath3 alone .",
    "in fact , recent results obtained applying mc techniques to a six - orbital microscopic model , in which both the correct lattice geometry and the spin - orbit interactions were considered , indicate that ( ga , mn)as is indeed in the vb regime for @xmath13.@xcite in addition , dmft techniques , which allow for the study of the very diluted ( @xmath14 ) regime , have shown that for values of @xmath3 in the weak coupling region , an ib never develops as a function of @xmath0.@xcite however , experiments based on electron paramagnetic resonance,@xcite infrared spectroscopy,@xcite and magnetization measurements@xcite of the electronic structure of one mn ion doped in gaas have actually shown the existence of a shallow hole state with binding energy @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 mev centered at the @xmath18=@xmath19 mn ion .",
    "moreover , analytical studies indicated that @xmath15 has contributions from @xmath20 the spin - dependent @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization and the coulomb attraction between the hole and the @xmath21 trapping center.@xcite when additional mn ions are added , the wave functions of the bounded holes will start to overlap and an ib will develop . further increasing @xmath0 should widen the ib , locating it closer to the vb and eventually a regime of complete hybridization with the holes doped into the vb is expected to occur .",
    "thus , it is clear that a crossover from the ib to the vb regime should take place in ( ga , mn)as as a function of @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", it will be argued that an ib - vb crossover will be missed in theoretical studies of materials with a weak @xmath3 if the coulomb attraction is disregarded , while materials with very strong @xmath3 will be in the ib regime regardless of doping .",
    "in fact , here we explicitly show that by the simultaneous consideration of @xmath3 and @xmath6 in the formalism , the experimentally observed transition from ib to vb with increasing @xmath0 can be understood .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following : in section [ section2 ] the non - magnetic interactions in dms are described ; the model used and the dmft technique are presented in section [ section3 ] ; in section [ section4 ] the results , including mc simulations , are discussed , and section [ section5 ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "as remarked in the introduction , most of the numerical work on dms has been performed on models that focused on the role of the spin dependent @xmath1-@xmath2 exchange @xmath3 interaction between the spins of the localized impurities and the doped holes.@xcite this is certainly sufficient to capture qualitatively many of the properties of these compounds , including the generation of ferromagnetism .",
    "however , non - magnetic interactions between holes and impurities must be considered in order to improve the quantitative agreement with experiments .",
    "this additional potential term in the model has been generally referred to as `` chemical disorder''(@xmath6),@xcite and it summarizes all the non - magnetic interactions between the localized impurities and the holes . in this context , tworzydlo @xcite used a short range potential ( less than nearest - neighbors range ) with a square - well form of depth @xmath22 , and considered both positive ( repulsive ) and negative ( attractive ) values of @xmath22 .",
    "the potential was introduced to explain an apparent @xmath0-dependence of the @xmath1-@xmath2 exchange in cd@xmath10mn@xmath11s .",
    "dietl @xcite recently used the same approach to address apparently contradictory experimental results for ga@xmath10mn@xmath11n .",
    "he also pointed out @xcite that this kind of extra potential term leds to a chemical shift in the standard impurity language , or to a valence - band offset in the alloy nomenclature , and that @xmath3 and @xmath6 are actually related @xcite through the expression @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an effective correlation energy for the 3@xmath2 shell , and @xmath25 is its energetic position with respect to the top of the valence band .",
    "however , the value of @xmath6 is not easy to determine and , thus , it has been added as an extra free parameter by some authors ( with @xmath6 allowed to take both positive and negative values).@xcite other efforts focused just on the attractive coulomb interaction between the holes and the impurities.@xcite    only some of the previously mentioned investigations have attempted to study the effects of the coulomb attraction at finite @xmath0 with unbiased techniques .",
    "the authors of ref .",

    "it was claimed that the ib - vb crossover for ( ga , mn)as using @xmath6=0.6  ev ( chosen to reproduce , in combination with @xmath3=0.8  ev , the single impurity bound state energy ) should occur for @xmath26 . in ref .",
    "[ ] , a repulsive on - site potential was added .",
    "both the repulsive and attractive cases were considered in ref .. however , these important previous efforts did not present a systematic analysis of results as a function of @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath0 , which is part of the goals of the present study .",
    "in this work we apply dmft to a model that includes @xmath3 and the coulomb attraction @xmath6 .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) and @xmath27 are studied in a wide range of couplings , hoppings , carrier fillings @xmath1 , and mn concentrations @xmath0 , and estimations of the most appropriate values for different materials are made .",
    "we obtain the ib - vb crossover for a large class of dms s and show that with a suitable strength @xmath6 included , the ib regime can always be reached by decreasing the mn concentration .",
    "the spin - fermion hamiltonian used here and in several previous studies contains a kinetic @xmath28-term that describes the hopping of holes between two neighboring @xmath29 and @xmath30 lattice sites ( @xmath28 is set to @xmath31 to define the energy unit ) , an exchange interaction ( ei ) @xmath32-term that anti - aligns the carrier s spin with the magnetic moment of the impurity ( considered classical ) at site @xmath33 , and a @xmath6-term that takes into account the on - site central - cell part of the attractive coulomb potential,@xcite @xmath34 here , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the creation ( destruction ) operator for a hole with spin @xmath37 at site @xmath29 , @xmath38=@xmath39 is the hole s spin , @xmath40=@xmath41 is the classical spin of the local moment , and @xmath42 is the number of holes at @xmath33 .",

    "@xcite we believe that the reason for this unexpected behavior is related to the fact that here an on - site central - cell potential is being considered .",

    "the main reason for it is to be able to compare our conclusions with previous results in the literature since an on - site potential is the only approach used in previous numerical investigations.@xcite there are still some quantitative aspects that may need the @xmath0 dependent potential of the previous paragraphs , and those will be clarified below .",

    "however , for most materials we find that the crossover occurs at very low levels of doping , outside the regime in which high @xmath166 would be expected .",
    "we also find that a doping - independent on - site square - well potential acts as a renormalization of the coupling @xmath3 in an extended doping range up to @xmath142 .",
    "however , this apparent boost to the @xmath3-term at all mn dopings is unphysical , since the effect of @xmath6 should be @xmath0-dependent beyond some critical value .",
    "our mc simulations demonstrate that this @xmath0-dependence is achieved naturally by considering a longer range ( next - nearest neighbors ) square - well attraction , which is beyond the capability of the single site dmft which can deal with on - site interactions only .",
    "thus , a phenomenological @xmath0-dependent coulomb attraction was introduced . with this modification",
    ", we have shown that for ( ga , mn)as , the coulombic attraction @xmath6 influences the physics of the material only at small mn doping , i.e @xmath0@xmath139@xmath167 .",
    "this result shows that it is correct to apply theories that consider the @xmath3-term only for studying the properties , including the curie temperature , of ( ga , mn)as at the relevant values of mn concentrations @xmath0@xmath70@xmath9@xmath168 . on the other hand",
    ", we found that the coulomb attraction will play a relevant role , and should be included , in studies of mn - doped gan .",
    "summarizing , here we have shown that the addition of an attractive coulomb potential is the necessary ingredient to explain the transition from the ib to the vb regime as a function of mn - impurity doping concentration in materials for which the magnetic interaction @xmath3 is not strong enough to bind a hole .",
    "however , we find that , except for the case of ( ga , mn)n , the crossover occurs at very low doping in a regime in which high ferromagnetic critical temperatures would not be expected and , thus , the effective value of @xmath3 will not be affected . as a consequence , it is not necessary to include the coulomb attraction in the calculations .",
    "in addition , we show that an on - site attractive potential does not capture the overlap of localized hole wave - functions that should occur as a function of doping and it provides unphysical results . thus , to study materials such as ( ga , mn)n , in which the coulomb attraction is relevant , a nearest - neighbor finite range potential has to be used .",

    "<S> the crossover between an impurity band ( ib ) and a valence band ( vb ) regime as a function of the magnetic impurity concentration in models for diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) is studied systematically by taking into consideration the coulomb attraction between the carriers and the magnetic impurities . </S>",
