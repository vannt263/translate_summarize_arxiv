    "the nature of a reentrant spin glass ( rsg ) phase and a ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase in reentrant ferromagnets has been a topic of much controversy .",
    "@xcite spin frustration effects occur as a result of a competition between ferromagnetic interactions as a majority and antiferromagnetic interactions as a minority .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the reentrant ferromagnet exhibits first a transition from a paramagnetic ( pm ) phase to a fm phase with decreasing temperature and then a second transition from the fm phase to a rsg phase .",
    "such a reentry behavior of the reentrant ferromagnets has been extensively studied experimentally in the last two decades .",
    "@xcite there are four types of reentrant ferromagnets : ( i ) metallic spin glasses such as fe@xmath21al@xmath22,@xcite ( fe@xmath23ni@xmath24)@xmath25p@xmath26b@xmath27al@xmath3 , @xcite ( fe@xmath28mn@xmath29)@xmath25p@xmath26b@xmath27al@xmath3 ( @xmath30),@xcite and n@xmath31mn@xmath32@xcite having ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky)-type interactions between distant spins , ( ii ) insulating spin glasses such as cdcr@xmath33in@xmath34s@xmath35 ( @xmath36),@xcite ( iii ) dilute magnetic semiconductors such as eu@xmath29sr@xmath28s ( @xmath37),@xcite and ( iv ) colossal magnetoresistance materials such as y@xmath21ca@xmath22mno@xmath3.@xcite in the case of ( ii ) and ( iii ) , ferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions compete with antiferromagnetic next nearest neighbor interactions .    the nature of the rsg and fm phases in reentrant ferromagnets is basically understood in terms of a mean - field picture . the phase diagram ( @xmath38 vs @xmath39 ) of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model with ising spins,@xcite consists of the pm phase , fm phase , and the spin glass ( sg ) phase , where an infinite - ranged gaussian distribution of exchange interactions with variance @xmath40 and mean @xmath41 is assumed.@xcite for @xmath42 , as @xmath17 is lowered , the system undergoes a transition from the pm phase to the sg phase . for @xmath43 ,",
    "as @xmath17 is lowered , the system undergoes a pm - fm transition followed by a fm - sg transition . this sg phase for @xmath43",
    "is called a rsg phase . however , the nature of the rsg phase is essentially the same as that of the normal sg phase for @xmath42 .",
    "when the parisi s solution for the sk model@xcite is discovered , the vertical phase boundary at @xmath39 = 1 is added to the sk phase diagram . for @xmath43 ,",
    "consequently the whole rsg phase and a part of the fm phase in the sk model are newly replaced by a rsg phase with replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) .",
    "this rsg phase is very different from the normal sg phase for @xmath42 .",
    "it is a mixed phase of the sg phase and the fm phase .    in the mean - field picture , a true reentrance from the fm phase to the normal sg phase",
    "is not predicted .",
    "there is a normal fm long - range order in the fm phase .",
    "this picture , which assumes infinite - range interactions , is not always appropriate for real reentrant magnets where the short - range interactions are large and random in sign and the spin symmetry is rather heisenberg - like than ising - like .",
    "neutron scattering studies on ( fe@xmath28mn@xmath29)@xmath25p@xmath26b@xmath27al@xmath3@xcite have questioned the existence of a true long - range order even in the fm phase .",
    "aeppli et al.@xcite have proposed a phenomenological random - field picture to explain their result . in this picture , the system in the fm phase consists of regions which would order ferromgnetically and other regions forming pm clusters .",
    "the frustrated spins in the pm clusters can generate random molecular fields , which act on the unfrustrated spins in the infinite fm network . in the fm phase well above @xmath6 , the fluctuations of the spins in the pm clusters are so rapid that the fm network is less influenced by them and their effect is only to reduce the net fm moment .",
    "on decreasing the temperature toward @xmath6 , the thermal fluctuations of the spins in the pm clusters become slower .",
    "the coupling between the pm clusters and the fm network becomes important and the molecular field from the slow pm spins acts as a random magnetic field .",
    "this causes breakups of the fm network into finite - sized clusters . below @xmath6 ,",
    "the ferromagnetism completely disappears , leading to a sg phase .",
    "this picture is very different from the mean - field picture .",
    "the rsg phase is not a mixed phase but a normal sg phase .",
    "jonason et al.@xcite have shown from a dynamic scaling analysis of low - field dynamic susceptibility of ( fe@xmath23ni@xmath24)@xmath25p@xmath26b@xmath27al@xmath3 that there is a spin - glass relaxation time which diverges at a finite temperature with a dynamic critical exponent similar to that observed for an ordinary pm - sg transition .",
    "this suggests that the rsg phase is a normal sg phase .",
    "the fm phase just above @xmath6 shows a dynamic behavior characterized by an aging effect and chaotic nature similar to that of sg phase .",
    "dupuis et al.@xcite have shown that the aging behavior of the low frequency ac susceptibility is observed both in the fm phase and rsg phase of cdcr@xmath33in@xmath34s@xmath35 with @xmath9 = 0.90 , 0.95 , and 1.00 , with the same qualitative features as in normal spin glasses .",
