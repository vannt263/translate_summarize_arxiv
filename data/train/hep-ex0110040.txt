    "investigations of the exclusive production of vector mesons in electron - proton interactions by the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera have yielded detailed information on vacuum - exchange dynamics , since the high flux of real and virtual photons from the electron beam provides a means of investigating such processes with high precision .",
    "the particular interest in the light vector mesons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 lies in the opportunity to reach kinematic regions of momentum transfer in which effects of binding are small and the fundamental scaling properties of the underlying vacuum - exchange process are revealed .",
    "in contrast to studies of inclusive processes , decay - angle analyses in exclusive and semi - exclusive processes yield detailed information on the spin - density matrix , i.e. the helicity - transfer characteristics of the production mechanism",
    ". since these are related on very general theoretical grounds to the scaling properties in field theoretical descriptions  @xcite , stringent constraints on the phenomenological interpretation of strong vacuum - exchange mechanisms are obtained . in recent years ,",
    "much theoretical work has been done on such interpretations , both for vector - meson electroproduction at high photon virtuality  @xcite , and for photoproduction at high momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "this report concerns recent results on elastic electroproduction from longitudinal and transverse virtual photons , including a regge analysis at high , investigations of the dependence of the spin - density matrix elements on proton dissociation and the momentum transferred to the proton , as well as scaling and helicity - transfer properties of and @xmath0 photoproduction at high momentum transfer .",
    "the results address quantitatively a variety of theoretical concerns . by comparing the properties of the photon / vector - meson transition for elastic electroproduction to those for the proton - dissociative process",
    ", one tests the interpretation of the process as diffraction , since any difference implies a correlation between the photon / vector - meson and the hadronic vertices .",
    "any dependence in an extracted regge trajectory challenges a canonical assumption of fixed poles in regge theory .",
    "the dependence of the forward cross sections on confront recent qcd descriptions of diffractive processes which predict asymptotic dominance of the production of longitudinal vector mesons from longitudinal virtual photons , with a q@xmath3 dependence modified by the dependence in the gluon density and in the strong coupling .",
    "the transverse cross section is expected to be suppressed by a factor of , though corrections due to the endpoints of the quark momentum distributions in the meson mitigate this expectation .",
    "a related line of argument has been proposed to predict the dominance of longitudinal vector mesons at high in diffractive photoproduction , where @xmath4 is the square of the momentum transferred to the proton .",
    "again , production of transverse vector mesons is expected to be suppressed by a factor of @xmath4 , resulting in a prediction of @xmath5 , modified by the @xmath4 dependence in the gluon density and in the strong coupling .",
    "these helicity selection rules in the dependence on momentum transfer are straightforward consequences of the two - gluon model for diffractive processes  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dsigdq2 ] shows the recently obtained dependence of the total elastic cross section presented by the zeus collaboration  @xcite .",
    "a fit to the form @xmath6 shows that the power @xmath7 varies with the lower bound on chosen for the fit . for lower bounds greater than @xmath8 ,",
    "the fit is statistically consistent with a power of @xmath9 .",
    "the h1 collaboration has remarked upon the scaling of the total cross section , pointing out that the @xmath0 and cross sections exhibit scaling behavior remarkably similar to that for the when weighted with normalization factors corresponding to the quark - charge content of the meson , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmscale ]  @xcite .    however , each of the above observations is difficult to interpret phenomenologically , since the contributions from longitudinal and transverse photons are expected to scale differently , and the relative contributions are known to vary rapidly with , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvsq2 ]  @xcite .",
    "this measurement of the ratio allowed extraction of the scaling properties of @xmath10 and @xmath11 separately , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qsiglt ]  @xcite .",
    "the separation of the scaling properties of the cross sections for longitudinal and transverse photons was obtained by analysis of the polar decay - angle distribution .",
    "the hard scaling behavior is impressive , since the longitudinal cross section is even harder than a point - like - scattering ( rutherford ) cross section . in the context of qcd calculations which model vacuum exchange as the exchange of a color - neutral pair of gluons",
    ", this indicates that the dependence of the square of the gluon density compensates the leading @xmath12 behavior by more than a factor of .",
    "also remarkable is the hard behavior of the transverse cross section , which encourages a leading - order field theoretical interpretation as well . in the case of the production of transverse vector mesons",
    ", however , the qcd calculation is complicated by contributions arising from the endpoints of the quark momentum distribution in the vector meson  @xcite , resulting in the necessity for modelling non - perturbative effects  @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally established that the spin - flip contributions are rather small ( @xmath13  10% )  @xcite , so the observed dependences in the cross sections for longitudinal and transverse photons are each determined by the helicity - conserving amplitudes to a good approximation .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0 to elastic electroproduction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiovsq2 ]  @xcite .    of particular interest is the observation that the dependence for these two vector mesons becomes similar at the same scale at which the cross section ratio reaches the value obtained from simple quark - charge counting . since the ratio @xmath14 for the @xmath0",
    "is known to exhibit a dependence similar to that for the  @xcite , we can conclude that @xmath10 and @xmath11 show a hard scaling behavior for the @xmath0 as well , and that the observed scaling is a property of the vacuum - exchange process little modified by meson binding effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratiovsq2 ] also shows that the @xmath1/ ratio , which reached the value derived from quark - charge counting at low , does not rise with in this range .",
    "one can conclude either that some @xmath0 suppression mechanism is active at low , @xmath15 that there is an additional production mechanism which is similar for the and @xmath1 at low but absent in the case of the @xmath0 .",
    "the h1 collaboration has investigated the dependence of the ratio @xmath14 and the combination of spin - density matrix elements @xmath16 on the momentum transfer to the proton  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : h1hight ] shows the dependence on @xmath17 , which denotes the momentum transferred to the proton after subtraction of the kinematic lower bound .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 shows no strong dependence on @xmath17 for greater than a few .",
    "the sum @xmath16 must vanish for amplitudes which conserve helicity  @xcite in the photon / vector - meson transition .",
    "such conservation of helicity is a simple consequence of angular momentum conservation at zero momentum transfer .",
    "these results show evidence for a nonzero contribution from helicity - violating amplitudes which increases with @xmath17 .",
    "the zeus collaboration has extracted a measurement of the pomeron trajectory in electroproduction at values of 3.5 and 10.0   by measuring the energy dependence of the elastic cross section in four bins of @xmath4 up to a value of 0.6  @xcite .",
    "they find a value for the intercept of and a slope of .",
    "one can conclude that the trajectory for this process has a higher intercept and less shrinkage than the soft pomeron trajectory which successfully describes hadronic cross sections at low momentum transfer .",
    "the zeus collaboration has extended its previous measurement of proton - dissociative vector - meson photoproduction  @xcite to higher momentum transfer ( @xmath18 ) by exploiting the higher statistics of the data set recorded in 1996/1997  @xcite . a small electron calorimeter positioned near the electron beam - pipe 44  m from the interaction point served to select events initiated by quasi - real photons in the process where @xmath19 represents a dissociated state of the proton . the resulting range in @xmath20 center - of - mass energy extends from 80 to 120  ge-1.ptv . since the transverse momentum of the final - state positron was required to be small by the geometrical acceptance of the calorimeter ( @xmath21 ) , the transverse momentum of the vector meson , @xmath22 , provided an accurate estimate of the square of the momentum transferred to the proton via @xmath23 .",
    "the differential cross sections @xmath24 were obtained in the region @xmath25 and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdt ] .",
    "the measurements provide good sensitivity to the observed power - law dependence @xmath26  @xcite . over the region in momentum transfer covered by the data ,",
    "the power is found to be for the and for the @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : phirhovst ]    shows the ratio of and @xmath0 cross sections as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "just as in the case of electroproduction , one observes that the momentum - transfer dependence for these two vector mesons becomes similar at the same scale at which the cross section ratio reaches the value obtained from quark - charge counting .",
    "such an observation yields valuable information concerning the nature of the short - distance coupling which is free of the large uncertainties arising from meson - binding effects in calculations of the absolute magnitudes of the cross sections .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhoelements ] shows the values for the combinations of spin - density matrix elements measured in the @xmath27-channel helicity frame @xmath28 , and @xmath29 as a function of @xmath4 obtained from this data sample .    the helicity - conserving ( transverse - to - transverse ) process clearly dominates , as shown by the small value of @xmath28 , which is the probability for longitudinal production , and by the small value of , which is sensitive to the interference between the helicity - conserving ( ) and single - flip ( ) amplitudes .",
    "the statistical power of the data also allow accurate determination of a non - zero double - flip contribution , as shown by the non - zero value of @xmath29 at high , since it arises from the interference between the non - flip and double - flip amplitudes .",
    "it should be noted that these results represent the first measurements of light - vector - meson photoproduction at values of @xmath4 comparable to those of in inclusive deep inelastic electron - proton scattering which revealed the existence of fractionally charged proton constituents at slac in 1967 .",
    "in contrast to the deep inelastic scattering process , this vacuum - exchange reaction is presumably sensitive to strong couplings rather than to the electric charges of the proton constituents .",
    "a transition to power - law scaling is observed , and the momentum - transfer dependence for the becomes similar to that for the @xmath0 at the same scale at which the cross section ratio reaches the value obtained from quark - charge counting .",
    "since this is also the region in which the momentum transfer exceeds the masses , one can plausibly assume that the observed dependence characterizes the underlying dynamics independent of meson - binding effects .",
    "given the phenomenological successes of qcd descriptions of diffractive electroproduction of longitudinal vector mesons during the past few years , it is remarkable that the observed power for the dominant transverse - to - transverse amplitude in photoproduction is lower than expected from two - gluon - exchange calculations  @xcite .",
    "these calculations yield a leading @xmath30 dependence , further steepened by the running of the strong coupling constant : @xmath31 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this expectation for the leading power behavior is not specific to qcd .",
    "chernyak and zhitnitsky have pointed out , for example , that these rules hold for the exchange of any vector or axial - vector current or for any lagrangian with dimensionless coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "investigations of the diffractive production of light vector mesons at hera provide detailed information on the dynamics which govern vacuum - exchange processes .",
    "the dependence on proton - dissociation of the helicity - transfer properties of the virtual - photon / vector - meson transition has been shown to be weak , supporting the characterization of vector - meson electroproduction in this kinematic region as a diffractive process .",
    "a pomeron trajectory has been measured in exclusive electroproduction at high photon virtuality for the first time .",
    "this trajectory exhibits a higher intercept and weaker slope than does the trajectory measured in photoproduction , which was similar to that determined in soft hadronic processes .",
    "high - statistics measurements at values of both and @xmath4 far exceeding the light - meson mass scale have been obtained . the expectation that meson - binding effects are small in this region are supported by the observation that the momentum - transfer dependence for the becomes similar to that for the @xmath0 at the same scale at which the cross section ratio reaches the value obtained from quark - charge counting .",
    "the common power behavior may thus be interpreted as characterizing the vacuum - exchange dynamics alone .",
    "decay - angle analyses have experimentally distinguished the momentum - transfer scaling properties of the various helicity amplitudes .",
    "the dependence for the longitudinal elastic electroproduction has been found to follow a power law with a power approximately one unit lower than observed for the transverse cross section , as expected on very general theoretical grounds .",
    "however , results on the semi - exclusive photoproduction of and @xmath0 mesons at high momentum transfer show a remarkably hard power law to govern the short - distance transverse - to - transverse vacuum - exchange amplitude",
    ". the fundamental nature of the theoretical basis which leads to the expectation of a softer spectrum is likely to motivate an intensification of the already widespread phenomenological activities which address the many experimental results on the diffractive production of vector mesons at hera .",
