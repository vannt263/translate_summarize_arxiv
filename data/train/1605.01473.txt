    "as wireless networks grow in size and get more complex , interference becomes a more challenging bottleneck to deal with . as a result , there has been a significant amount of research on developing communication strategies that exploit channel state information to efficiently manage the interference and increase network throughput .",
    "however , obtaining channel state information at transmitters ( csit ) is a burdensome task on communication systems .",
    "thus , there has been a growing attention on interference management with a minimal effort to obtain csit .",
    "our focus in this paper is on the scenario in which interference management primarily relies on a coarse knowledge about channel states in the network , namely the `` topology '' of the network .",
    "network topology simply refers to a 1-bit feedback information for each link between each transmitter and each receiver , indicating whether or not the signal of the transmitter is received above the noise floor at the corresponding receiver . quite interestingly , it has been shown in @xcite that the problem of interference management in this model ( a.k.a . , topological interference management )",
    "is equivalent to the index coding problem @xcite-@xcite , under the assumption that channel gains remain constant throughout the duration of communication , i.e. , quasi - static fading channel .",
    "this model has also been studied for the fast fading scenario in @xcite , where a structured repetition coding scheme was proposed to neutralize interference by only resending symbols at the transmitters in a structured way according to network topology .",
    "there has also been a general outer bound developed for this problem in @xcite , by converting the problem to determining rank loss conditions for an ensemble of full - rank matrices with randomly - scaled rows .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the aforementioned topological interference management problem in a scenario that the receivers are equipped with reconfigurable antennas .",
    "reconfigurabe antennas at the receivers have been considered to provide a diversity gain , offering a choice to receive the signal on its different preset modes , each of which has an independent channel gain .",
    "they provide additional opportunities for interference management , in particular alignment of interference via preset mode switching at the receivers .",
    "more specifically , with preset mode switching we can adjust the channel gains to change according to a desired pattern across time , hence increasing the flexibility for alignment of interference .",
    "this problem of interference management with reconfigurable antennas at the receivers was first proposed in @xcite for @xmath0-user multiple - input single - output broadcast channels .",
    "it was extended to 3-user single - input single - output interference channels in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the author showed the condition for precoding matrices to align interference over time at the unintended receivers without knowledge about channel gain values at the transmitters .",
    "this approach was also applied to fully - connected @xmath0-user siso interference channels in @xcite .",
    "we present our results on the topological interference management problem in a scenario that the changing patterns of the channels can be designed as desired according to the network topology by reconfigurable antenna switching .",
    "our contributions in this paper are three - fold .",
    "we first characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions for the topologies in which half linear symmetric degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) is achievable .",
    "this corresponds to the `` best '' topologies since half symmetric dof is the highest possible value for the symmetric dof in the presence of interference .",
    "we next derive a general upper bound on the linear symmetric dof for arbitrary network topologies .",
    "we finally demonstrate that this upper bound is tight in network topologies in which each transmitter has at most two co - interferers , and we propose an optimal linear scheme for such network topologies .",
    "we show that the benefits from network topology knowledge at the transmitters and preset mode switching at the receivers can be simultaneously exploited to achieve dof gain for a large class of network topologies .",
    "we demonstrate that the desired changing patterns of the receiver preset modes provide an additional dof gain , compared to the scenario where channel gains remain constant over time @xcite .",
    "in particular , we highlight the distinction between the two scenarios by comparing the class of the best topologies and the upper bound on the symmetric dof .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_model ]",
    ", we introduce the system model . in section [ sec_results ] ,",
    "we state our main results and their implications . in section [ sec_half ]",

    ", we derive the upper bound on the linear symmetric dof for general network topologies . in section [ sec_2_coint ] , we propose a new linear scheme for the class of the topologies with at most two co - interferers .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_con ] , we conclude this paper .",

    "to present the main results of this paper , we first define the notions of the alignment and conflict graphs for a given network topology , which were first defined in @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the conflict graph defined in @xcite , we assign a direction to the conflict edges .",
    "we also use the notions of alignment sets , internal conflicts , and conflict distance defined in @xcite .",
    "an _ alignment set _ is defined as a set of vertices connected through alignment edges .",
    "an _ internal conflict _ is defined as a conflict edge between two vertices that belong to the same alignment set .    for two vertices that have an internal conflict between them , the _ conflict distance _",
    "is defined as the minimum number of alignment edges that are needed to be traversed to go from one vertex to the other .",
    "finally , we define the notions of co - interferers and internal conflict cycles .    for a transmitter @xmath17 , its set of _ co - interferers _",
    ", denoted by @xmath53 , is defined as the set of transmitters interfering together with @xmath17 at one of its unintended receivers . to be precise ,",
    "@xmath54    an _ internal conflict cycle _ is defined as a directed cycle of conflict edges among nodes all of which receive interference from a single transmitter outside the cycle .",
    "based on the above definitions , our main results are presented as follows .",

    "the topologies in which half linear symmetric dof is achievable correspond to the `` best '' topologies since half symmetric dof is the highest possible value for the symmetric dof in the presence of interference ( i.e. , as long as at least one interference link from @xmath17 to @xmath14 ( @xmath47 ) exists in the network topology ) .",
    "therefore , theorem [ thm1 ] characterizes the best topologies for topological interference management with reconfigurable antennas at the receivers .    without reconfigurable antennas ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that half linear symmetric dof is achievable if and only if there is no internal conflict in the alignment and conflict graphs of the network , which is strictly more restrictive than the above condition in theorem 1 .",
    "therefore , theorem 1 demonstrates that the class of `` best '' network topologies is extended by utilizing preset mode switching of reconfigurable antennas at the receivers . in particular ,",
    "if receivers are equipped with reconfigurable antennas , each receiver can distinguish its desired signal by preset mode switching although an interferer has the identical beamforming vector with its corresponding transmitter .",
    "thus , if each vertex has at most one incoming internal conflict on the alignment and conflict graphs of the network , half linear symmetric dof is achievable .",
