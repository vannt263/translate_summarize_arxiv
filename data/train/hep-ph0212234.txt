    "high - energy soft processes are presently a topical problem in high - energy physics , mainly because they are essentially a nonperturbative phenomenon @xcite . despite important results at the interface between soft and hard physics and recent progress in nonperturbative qcd , _ elastic scattering _ , the simplest soft process , can not be described in a pure qcd framework , but only in a phenomenological context .    in this area , a variety of models , such as , for example , regge , diffraction , qcd - inspired models , and others @xcite , has survived due to a solid theoretical basis and efficiency in describing physical quantities .",
    "what is presently well established and accepted concerns some general principles , limits , bounds , and theorems , earlier deduced from the mandelstam representation , potential scattering , and also from axiomatic field theories @xcite . in this context ,",
    "analyticity , unitarity and crossing play central roles and are also the framework of several models referred to above . among them ,",
    "the so called analytic models are characterized by parametrizations of the hadronic amplitude through general analytic functions that strictly obey the formal principles and theorems . specifically , the aim is to investigate two fundamental physical quantities that characterize the forward elastic scattering at high energies , namely , the total cross section @xmath0 and the @xmath1 parameter ( the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the forward elastic scattering amplitude ) . in terms of the scattering amplitude @xmath12",
    "they may be given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the four - momentum transfer squared and @xmath15 the center - of - mass energy squared .",
    "these expressions , in terms of real and imaginary parts of the amplitude , obviously suggest dispersion relations as a suitable formal framework for investigations . for particle - particle and particle - antiparticle interactions ,",
    "the addition of crossing symmetry extends and completes the analytical approach .",
    "it is expected that such a general formalism , avoiding details of the interaction or dynamics , could be a suitable tool in the search for adequate calculational schemes in nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the analytic models have a long history and important results have been obtained through both _ integral _",
    "relations @xcite , for example @xcite , and _ derivative _ ( _ analyticity _ ) relations @xcite , for example @xcite .",
    "recently , much effort has been concentrated in the compete collaboration ( computerized models , parameter evaluation for theory and experiment ) , which joined the compas group and others specialists also with outstanding contributions in the area .",
    "these authors have investigated a large class of analytic models , through several statistical indicators that complement the usual @xmath16 and and @xmath17 criteria .",
    "one of the main results is the universality of the @xmath18 increase of the total cross section for all the collisions considered @xcite .    despite all",
    "the experience accumulated and the detailed analyses that have been developed , we understand that three aspects yet need some investigation and this is the main purpose of this work .",
    "these aspects are based on the following observations .    1 .",
    ": :    beyond the energy region of the accelerators , experimental information    on @xmath2 total cross sections exists from cosmic - ray    experiments . despite the model dependence involved , the large error    bars in the numerical results , and also the existence of discrepant    values , some of these results are usually displayed as a support for    several model predictions .",
    "however , this set of experimental    information is not usually taken into account in explicitly    _ quantitative analyses _ that could provide , for example , bounds for    the increase of @xmath0 and @xmath1    ( and , consequently , the intercept of exchanged trajectories ) or for    the differences between @xmath2 and @xmath3    total cross sections ( for exceptions , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover ,    as will be discussed in some detail , several results obtained by    different authors , through different approaches , indicate nearly the    same increase of @xmath19 and this increase is    faster than usually believed or accepted .",
    "2 . : :    in general , the fits are performed with the full hadronic amplitude ,    that is , simultaneous fits to @xmath0 and    @xmath1 . although some authors correctly claim that this    procedure maximizes the number of data points , it must first be    recalled that important results have been obtained through fits to    only the @xmath0data ; a classical example is the    approach by donnachie and landshoff @xcite . moreover , as will be    discussed , in the bulk of experimental data available ,    @xmath0and @xmath1have different status    as physical quantities , since @xmath1is estimated either by    extrapolations through dispersion relations ( and fits to    @xmath0data ) , or as a fit parameter to the    differential cross section in the region of coulomb - nuclear    interference , and this is a delicate problem . finally , since from the    previous observation we shall also be interested in the high - energy    cosmic - ray results , which concern only @xmath0(and    not @xmath1 ) , global fits may constrain the possible    increase of this quantity .",
    ":    the connection between @xmath0 and    @xmath1 through _ standard dispersion relations _ demands one    subtraction @xcite .",
    "although the subtraction constant works as a fit    parameter in traditional analysis @xcite , it    does not appear in the approach by the compete collaboration , since    the derivative relation or prescription used does not involve    subtraction constant .",
    "once the analytical approach demands fits to    experimental data and the free parameters involved are all    _ correlated _ , it is expected that the presence or not of the    subtraction constant may lead to different results .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the above three observations and their inter - connections in a quantitative way . to this end",
    ", we shall analyze only @xmath2 and @xmath3 elastic scattering , since for particle and antiparticle interactions they correspond to the highest energy interval with available data and are the only set including the cosmic - ray information on total cross sections ( @xmath2 scattering ) .",
    "we shall use as framework two well known analytic models characterized by _ distinct asymptotic inputs _",
    ", the pomeron - reggeon model by donnachie and landshoff @xcite and the maximal odderon model in the form discussed by kang and nicolescu @xcite .",
    "for the connections between real and imaginary parts of the forward amplitude we shall use _ derivative _ ( _ analyticity _ ) relations with _ one subtraction_. observation 1 is treated by the selection of two different ensembles of data from cosmic - ray results , observation 2 through individual and simultaneous fits to @xmath0and @xmath1 , and observation 3 by treating the subtraction constant as a free fit parameter or assuming that its value is zero .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the experimental data to be analyzed and the criteria for the selection of two ensembles of data . in sec .",
    "iii we review the main formulas in the analytical approach , including the dispersion relations , the models to be used and some high - energy theorems .",
    "the fits and results for all the cases considered are presented in sec .",
    "iv and the conclusions and final remarks in sec . v.",
    "in this section we review the experimental information that constitutes our data base ( accelerator and cosmic - ray regions ) , together with discussions concerning the differences in the determination of @xmath0and @xmath1 , as well as the model dependences and discrepancies related to _ all _ the cosmic - ray information presently available . the criteria for selecting two ensembles of data are also presented and justified in detail .      in the case of accelerator experiments , data on @xmath0 from @xmath2 and @xmath20 scattering and extracted values for the @xmath1 parameter",
    "have been accumulated for a long time .",
    "presently , experimental information extends up to @xmath21 gev and @xmath22 tev for @xmath2 and @xmath20 scattering , respectively .",
    "the database , analyzed and compiled by the particle data group ( pdg ) , has become a standard reference and the corresponding readable files are available @xcite . since recent analysis has shown that general fits to these data are stable for @xmath23 above @xmath24 9 gev @xcite , we shall use here the sets for energies above @xmath25 gev ; in our analysis the statistic and systematic errors are added linearly .    at this point",
    ", we briefly recall some differences in the determination of @xmath0and @xmath1@xcite , which suggest that they do not have the same status as physical quantities ; this , in turn , corroborates our motivation to investigate global and individual fits separately .",
    "first , one of the methods that was used to extract @xmath0at the isr did not depend on the @xmath1value , but only on the machine luminosity and the rates of elastic and inelastic interactions .",
    "therefore in these determinations @xmath0and @xmath1are independent quantities .",
    "other methods demand the determination of @xmath1and the elastic scattering rate at small momentum transfer , extrapolated to the forward direction ( slope parameter ) . in these cases ,",
    "the quantities to be determined correspond to @xmath26 ( luminosity dependent ) or @xmath27 ( luminosity independent ) @xcite . in both cases , since it is known that @xmath28 , @xmath0may be obtained with reasonable accuracy even with a rough estimation of the @xmath1parameter .",
    "specifically , some authors use the @xmath1value extrapolated from fits to @xmath0and dispersion relations ; in the other procedure , @xmath1is determined from fits to the differential cross section data in the region of coulomb - nuclear interference . in this case",
    "the determination is model dependent and it is interesting to note that the procedure , in the last instance , demands knowledge of how the hadronic exchanged object interacts , which is exactly what is looked for .",
    "this point seems clear in the donnachie - landshoff approach , since the authors do not use the @xmath1data as input .",
    "we understand that all these facts reinforce the differences in the determination of @xmath1and @xmath0 , putting some limits on the interpretation of @xmath0and @xmath1as physical quantities with the same status . beyond these motivations for discriminating between individual and global fits ,",
    "we add our interest in investigating cosmic - ray information , which concerns only @xmath0 and not @xmath1 .      for @xmath2 collisions",
    ", the total cross section may also be inferred from cosmic - ray experiments and estimations exist in the high - energy interval @xmath29 tev .",
    "the procedure is model dependent and different analyses lead to different results , as briefly reviewed in what follows .    the extraction of the proton - proton total cross section is based on the determination of the proton - air production cross section from analysis of extensive air showers .",
    "detailed reviews on the subtleties involved may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we recall only the two main steps , stressing the model dependence involved .",
    "the first step concerns the determination of the proton - air production cross section , namely , the `` inelastic cross section in which at least one new hadron is produced in addition to nuclear fragments '' @xcite .",
    "this is obtained by the formulas    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the interaction length of protons in the atmosphere , @xmath32 is the shower attenuation length , and the inelasticity coefficient @xmath33 is a measure of the dissipation of energy through the shower .",
    "@xmath32 is an experimental quantity determined through the @xmath34 attenuation method or the zenith angle attenuation technique @xcite . on the other hand , the coefficient @xmath33 is model dependent and obtained through monte carlo simulation ; roughly @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) when going from feynman scaling models to strongly scaling violation models in the fragmentation region @xcite .    in a second step @xmath37",
    "is obtained from @xmath38 through the multiple diffraction formalism ( mdf ) by glauber and matthiae @xcite , and taking into account the different processes and effects in the p - air total cross section :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 concerns the quasielastic excitation of the nucleus and @xmath41 is the gribov screening correction due to multiple scattering @xcite .",
    "two important inputs at this point are the nucleon distribution function and a relation between the slope parameter @xmath42 and @xmath37 , necessary in the parametrization of the scattering amplitude :    @xmath43    with the screening correction , the mdf allows the determination of all the above cross sections and from the strong correlation between @xmath44 the @xmath2 total cross section may eventually be estimated ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the results presently available from cosmic - ray experiments , in the above energy region , are characterized by discrepancies , mainly due to the model dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath45 . before reviewing these results",
    ", it is important to draw attention to two facts .",
    "first , as is well known , discrepancies also characterize some @xmath0data from accelerator experiments at the highest energies , for example , at @xmath46 gev and mainly at @xmath22 tev .",
    "second , when performing quantitative analyses , it is fundamental to select as complete a set of information as possible , or at least those obtained in similar circumstances or bases . in the case of cosmic - ray information , it is important to stress that there is no experimental determination of @xmath37 , since all the results are model dependent . therefore they can not be distinguished in terms of an `` experimental '' status and _ all _ the information available must be considered .",
    "despite the model dependence involved , we can classify the complete set of cosmic - ray information available according to the _ inputs or procedures used _ and , simultaneously , by the _ value of the total cross section extracted _ , as explained in what follows .",
    "on one hand the results usually quoted in the literature concern those obtained by the fly s eye collaboration in 1984 @xcite and akeno ( agasa ) collaboration in 1993 @xcite . in the first case , the authors used @xmath47 ( feynman scaling model ) , a relation of proportionality between @xmath42 and @xmath37 , namely , the geometrical scaling model @xcite , and a gaussian profile distribution for the nucleus . at @xmath48 tev , from the value @xmath49 mb",
    ", they extracted @xmath50 mb @xcite .",
    "the akeno collaboration used @xmath51 ( feynman scaling model ) and the durand and pi approach @xcite to extract the proton - proton cross sections in the region @xmath52 tev . we shall return to these results later on .    on the other hand , in 1987 gaisser , sukhatme , and yodh ( gsy ) making use of the fly s eye result for @xmath53 , as an estimate of the _ lowest _ allowed values for @xmath37 , and the chou - yang prescription for @xmath45 @xcite obtained @xmath54 mb at @xmath55 tev @xcite . in 1993 , nikolaev claimed that the akeno results should be corrected in order to take into account the differences between absorption and inelastic cross sections , leading to an increase of the results by @xmath56 mb @xcite .",
    "the analysis by nikolaev was also motivated by previous results from a qcd model of the pomeron @xcite .    at this point",
    "some fundamental facts concerning all these results must be stressed .",
    "first , as reviewed above , the fly s eye and akeno results for @xmath37 are as model dependent as those by nikolaev and gsy and therefore can not be considered as experimental results ; what can and must be discussed is the class of model used in each case . in this sense , we first note that since the fly s eye collaboration used the geometrical scaling hypothesis , which is violated even at the collider energy , their result is probably wrong .",
    "second , in 1990 , durand and pi asserted in ref .",
    "@xcite that their results published in 1988 @xcite , and used by the akeno collaboration @xcite , should be disregarded due to a wrong approximation concerning fluctuations .",
    "the new results presented in @xcite ( fig .",
    "11 in that paper ) introduced significant changes in the scenario .",
    "for example , for @xmath57 mb , the akeno result with the method by durand and pi @xcite was @xmath58 mb and from fig .",
    "11 in ref .",
    "@xcite the value extracted is @xmath59 mb , that is , an increase of @xmath60 ; to the fly s eye published point @xcite , the corresponding value is @xmath61 mb @xcite , that is , an increase of @xmath62 .",
    "however , to our knowledge no other publication by durand and pi on the subject appeared in the literature .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that the chou - yang prescription , used by gaisser , sukhatme , and yodh , is somewhat model independent and , also to our knowledge , the results by these authors together with those by nikolaev have never been criticized , despite the intrinsic model dependence involved . in conclusion , we understand that all these facts , not usually discussed in the literature , suggest an increase of the total cross section faster than indicated by the akeno and fly s eye results and that this indication has a reasonable basis .    it should also be recalled that , more recently , block , halzen , and stanev ( bhs ) obtained estimations for @xmath37 from @xmath63 @xcite , through a qcd - inspired model @xcite and the mdf . in the analysis ,",
    "the inelasticity coefficient @xmath33 is considered as a free parameter , determined through a global fit , including @xmath2 and @xmath3 accelerator data and the published results on the @xmath64 cross section @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath33 is determined in a way that their predictions for @xmath65 ( asymptotically ) matches @xmath63 through the mdf .",
    "the resulting value @xmath66 seems to be in accord with those obtained by combinations of different simulation programs , namely , @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the extracted @xmath68 at the cosmic - ray energies shows agreement with the akeno results and is about @xmath69 mb below the fly s eye value at @xmath70 tev .",
    "the numbers associated with all the above cosmic - ray estimations of @xmath37 are displayed in table 1 . despite the importance and originality of the approach by bhs",
    ", we shall not include it in our analysis , because they are in agreement with the akeno results ( table 1 ) that will be used . however we will treat this case in further work . with the exception of the bhs results , all the other cosmic - ray estimates discussed above together with the accelerator results",
    "are displayed in fig . 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we shall focus our conclusions and present some discussion on the following five points .",
    "_ ensembles i and ii_. the figures corresponding to fits to the total cross section data show that , in general , the results with ensembles i and ii do not differ substantially , except in the case of individual fits with the kn model [ fig .",
    "also , the cosmic - ray information in ensemble ii ( nikolaev and gsy ) is not described in all the cases .",
    "this is a consequence of the small number of points and the large error bars in comparison with the accelerator data , as well as the choices for the parametrizations ( the models used ) .",
    "however , we must stress that , despite being a nonstandard result , the cosmic - ray information in ensemble ii has a reasonable basis , as discussed in sec .",
    "ii b. certainly , more precise data are necessary for a truly conclusive result , but , at present , it seems reasonable and interesting to investigate the semiquantitative consequences of this nonstandard possibility .    based on these ideas , in what follows , we shall consider the results with both ensembles .",
    "however , it must also be noted that some of the conclusions that follow are independent of the ensemble used , such as those concerning global vs individual fits and the role of the subtraction constant .    _",
    "bounds for the pomeron intercept_. with the dl model and the cosmic - ray information in ensembles i and ii , we may infer some novel limit values for the soft pomeron intercept @xmath71 . from table",
    "ii the highest ( lowest ) @xmath72 value was obtained with ensemble ii ( i ) , in the case of individual fits to @xmath0(global fits to @xmath0and @xmath1 ) , namely ,      _ odderon_. in the case of _ individual _ fits with the kn model , table iii and fig .",
    "5 show that with ensemble ii the model predicts a crossing in @xmath19 , so that @xmath37 becomes greater than @xmath74 above @xmath75 gev : @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( sec .",
    "however , as shown in fig . 5 , in this case the @xmath78 data are not described ( @xmath79 or @xmath80 as a free parameter ) .",
    "on the other hand , table iii shows that , in the case of _ global fits _ with both ensembles i and ii , statistically , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , so that @xmath83 . however , from figs . 6 and 7",
    ", we see that , in both case , @xmath84 and @xmath80 as a free parameter , this model predicts a crossing in the @xmath78 behavior , with @xmath85 becoming greater than @xmath86 at @xmath87 gev ( for @xmath84 ) and @xmath88 gev ( for @xmath80 a free parameter ) , a result in agreement with the early fits by gauron , nicolescu , and leader @xcite .",
    "most important , these results are also in complete agreement with all the experimental data presently available on @xmath0and @xmath1and are independent of the ensemble used .",
    "this is certainly an interesting and important prediction that will be verified at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .    _",
    "individual and global fits_. from tables ii and iii , with the exception of the individual fit to ensemble ii with the kn model and @xmath80 as a free parameter , the statistical information does not indicate a preference between individual or global fits .              as discussed previously",
    ", @xmath0and @xmath1do not have the same status as physical quantities , since the extracted @xmath1value is model dependent .",
    "therefore , in principle , we understand that global fits underestimate the possible rise of @xmath0 in the asymptotic region . in our analysis the effects of the global and individual fits",
    "depend also on the subtraction constant , as discussed in what follows .",
    "_ subtraction constant_. as commented before , if @xmath80 is taken as a free parameter , the fit procedure demands that it is correlated with all the other parameters of the model involved . therefore , in principle",
    ", it is expected to have effects in both the low- and high - energy regions .",
    "let us discuss our results through individual and global fits .",
    "in the case of _ individual _ fits with the dl model , fig .",
    "2 shows that the results for @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 free are nearly the same above @xmath91 gev and that below this energy the predictions are quite different .",
    "we shall not discuss the corresponding results with the kn model , since the data are not described ( fig .",
    "5 ) .          in particular , with ensemble",
    "i , for @xmath2 scattering at @xmath95 tev the fits indicate @xmath96 mb for @xmath84 and @xmath97 mb for @xmath80 as a free parameter . on the other hand , for global fits ,",
    "the kn model is not so sensitive to the influence of the subtraction constant at least for @xmath78 above @xmath98 gev , as shown in figs .",
    "therefore , in general , the subtraction constant affects the fit results in both the low- and high - energy regions .",
    "since it is mathematically justified in order to control the convergence of the integral ( or derivative ) dispersion relation , we understand that the subtraction constant can not be neglected in the analytical approach .",
