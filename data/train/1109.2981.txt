    "the oort cloud is a roughly spherical cloud of comets ( oort 1950 ) , which surrounds the solar system and extends to heliocentric distances larger than 100,000 au .",
    "the oort cloud is currently feeding comets into the inner solar system at a rate of about 12 comets with @xmath6  au per year with an active comet absolute magnitude @xmath7 ( wiegert & tremaine 1999 ; @xmath8 is the perihelion distance and @xmath9 is a distance - independent measure of the active comet brightness that includes the coma ) .",
    "the oort cloud comets ( hereafter occs ) can be divided into two populations based on their dynamical histories : ( 1 ) dynamically new occs , which are on their first passage through the inner solar system and typically have @xmath10 au ; and ( 2 ) returning occs which have previously passed through the inner solar system and typically have @xmath11 au .",
    "the dynamical models of the orbital evolution of new occs into returning occs predict many times more returning comets than are observed ( wiegert & tremaine 1999 ) .",
    "this is the so - called `` fading problem '' , which is thought to be related to the physical evolution of occs . to resolve this problem , levison et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter l02 ) proposed that occs must physically disrupt as they evolve inward from the oort cloud .",
    "specifically , l02 estimated that , when a occ becomes inactive , it has only @xmath121% chance of becoming dormant , and @xmath1299% chance of being disrupted .",
    "if more occs would become dormant , l02 argued , the modern surveys of near - earth objects would discover a greater number of dormant occs passing through perihelion each year than they do .",
    "strong thermal gradients , phase transitions , and volatile pressure buildup experienced by occs during their approaches to the sun are thought to be responsible for disruptions .",
    "if these results are correct , the disrupted occs must be a prodigious source of dust particles and larger fragments that may further disintegrate .",
    "in particular , the dust production rate from occ disruptions should be vastly larger than that of active occs .",
    "on the other hand , the smallest dust particles produced in these disruption events may be lost from the solar system due to the effects of radiation pressure , while the large fragments should be dispersed over enormous radial distances .",
    "it is therefore not clear whether the disrupted occs can supply a significant amount of material to the inner zodiacal cloud , and whether they could represent a significant source of interplanetary dust particles accreted by the earth .    given their large speeds relative to the earth , the occ particles plunging into the upper atmosphere could produce meteor phenomena and be detected by optical and radar meteor surveys ( e.g. , see steel ( 1996 ) for a review ) .",
    "here we consider the radar meteors .",
    "the modern meteor radar surveys produced vast datasets including millions of high quality orbits covering both the northern and southern hemispheres ( e.g. , jones & brown 1993 , taylor & elford 1998 , galligan & baggaley 2004 , 2005 , janches et al .",
    "2003 , janches & chau 2005 , chau et al .",
    "2007 , campbell - brown 2008 ) .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity of meteor observations broke new grounds with routine measurements of meteor echoes using hpla radars such as the arecibo ( ao ) radar , which is capable of detecting @xmath1250-@xmath1 m particles down to @xmath1220 km s@xmath13 ( e.g. , janches et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 , fentzke et al . 2009 ) .",
    "it is natural to ask whether some of these observations can be linked to the particle populations from disrupted occs .",
    "meteors are produced by small interplanetary particles , also known as the _ meteoroids _ , that interact with air molecules upon atmospheric entry .",
    "based on meteor data , the meteoroids can be divided into two groups : sporadic meteoroids and meteoroid streams .",
    "the meteoroid streams are prominent concentrations of particles with similar orbits ( whipple & gossner 1949 , whipple 1951 ) .",
    "they are thought to be produced by particles released by active and recently ( @xmath14 few thousand years ago ) disrupted comets ( e.g. , jenniskens 2008 ) .",
    "sporadic meteoroids are those particles that have evolved significantly from their parent body so that they are no longer easily linked to that parent , or to other meteoroids from the same parent .",
    "notably , the time - integrated flux of meteors at earth is dominated by about a factor of @xmath1210 by sporadics ( jones & brown 1993 ) .",
    "the radiant distribution of sporadic meteors shows several concentrations on the sky known as the helion / antihelion , north / south apex , and north / south toroidal sources ( e.g. , younger et al . 2009 , and the references therein ) .",
    "wiegert et al .",
    "( 2009 ; hereafter w09 ) developed a dynamical model to explain these concentrations .",
    "their main results concern the prominent helion / antihelion sources for which the particles released by jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) such as 2p / encke provide the best match , in agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , jones et al . 2001 ) . as for the north / south apex source ,",
    "w09 pointed out the potential importance of retrograde halley - type comets ( htcs ) such as 55p / tempel - tuttle ( or an orbitally similar lost comet ) .",
    "the case for the retrograde htc particles is compelling , because three prominent retrograde htcs , namely 1p / halley , 55p / tempel - tuttle and 109p / swift - tuttle , all have associated streams , known as orionids/@xmath15 aquarids , leonids and perseids , respectively .",
    "the sporadic meteoroids with the north / south apex radiants can thus plausibly be a dynamically old component of htc particles .",
    "here we consider the possibility that at least some part of the meteoroid complex is produced by disrupting occs ( l02 , see also jones et al .",
    "we study the effects of radiation pressure on particles released from the highly - eccentric occ orbits , and their dynamical evolution under gravitational perturbations from planets and poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag ( see section 2 for our model ) .",
    "we show that a significant contribution of occ particles to the inner zodiacal cloud and meteor record is somewhat problematic , because most small occ particles are blown out from the solar system by radiation pressure , while most large ones get scattered by planets and never make it into the inner solar system ( section 3 ) .",
    "still , we find that there is a sweet spot at particle sizes @xmath12100 - 300 @xmath1 m .",
    "our modeling work shows that the orbits and impact speeds of these intermediate - size occ particles can match those derived from the meteor radar data for apex meteoroids .",
    "furthermore , we find that the preponderance of fast apex meteors in hpla radar observations ( e.g. , ao , altair , jicamarca ) can be linked to the competing effects of p - r drag and jupiter perturbations , which act as a size filter on populations of the long - period meteoroids ( section 4 ) .",
    "we studied the following sequence of events : ( 1 ) particles of different sizes were released from occs ( section 2.1 ) , ( 2 ) their orbits evolved under the influence of gravitational and radiation forces ( section 2.2 ) , ( 3 ) some particles were thermally or collisionally destroyed ( section 2.3 ) , and ( 4 ) a small fraction of the initial particle population was accreted by earth , producing meteors ( section 2.4 ) .",
    "we describe our model for ( 1)-(4 ) below .      according to francis ( 2005 ) ,",
    "occs have @xmath16 for @xmath17 au . for @xmath18",
    "au , francis result predicts @xmath19 being flat or declining while we would expect the perihelion distribution to increase with @xmath8 .",
    "it probably just shows that the distribution is not well constrained for @xmath18 au .",
    "we used @xmath20 for @xmath21 au , with @xmath22 .",
    "the initial values of @xmath8 in our numerical integrations were set to be uniformly random between 0 and 5 au , because particles starting with @xmath23 au do not reach 1 au ( see section 3.1 ) , where they could contribute to the earth impact record .",
    "the results for different @xmath19 were obtained by assigning the appropriate weight to particles starting with different @xmath8 s .    upon its release from a larger object",
    "a small particle will feel the effects of radiation pressure .",
    "these effects can be best described by replacing the mass of the sun , @xmath24 , by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 given by @xmath27 where radius @xmath28 and density @xmath29 of the particle are in cgs units .",
    "pressure coefficient @xmath30 can be determined using the mie theory ( burns et al .",
    "we set @xmath31 , which corresponds to the geometrical optics limit , where @xmath28 is much larger than the incident - light wavelength .",
    "we used particles with @xmath32 , 30 , 100 , 300 , 1000 @xmath1 m , which should cover the interesting range of sizes , and @xmath33 g @xmath34 .    for large eccentricity @xmath35 of the parent object and/or for large @xmath26 , the released particle may become unbound and escape to interstellar space .",
    "to stay bound , the heliocentric distance , @xmath36 , of the released particle must fulfill the following condition ( e.g. , kresak 1976 , liou et al .",
    "1999 ) : @xmath37 this condition shows that all particles with @xmath26 released at the orbit s perihelion will be removed , if @xmath38 .",
    "the new occs have @xmath39 .",
    "it follows that particles produced by a new occ near its perihelion will become unbound for sizes up to @xmath40 cm .",
    "the usual near - perihelion activity of occs therefore can not be a major source of small dust particles in the inner solar system .",
    "motivated by the l02 results , we now consider occs disruptions .",
    "interestingly , observations of the disruption events of comets show that there does not seem to be any correlation between the time of disruption and the orbital phase of the parent object .",
    "many comets were seen to disrupt ( or suffer outburst / splitting events ) at large heliocentric distances .",
    "for example ,",
    "174p / echeclus showed an outburst with @xmath41 au , more than 6 au beyond its perihelion distance ( choi et al .",
    "it may therefore be possible that occs could disrupt at relatively large @xmath36 and produce particles that , according to eq .",
    "( [ rstar ] ) , will stay on bound orbits .",
    "we release particles with @xmath42 in our model .",
    "for example , a @xmath43-@xmath1 m particle with @xmath33  g  @xmath34 ejected from the parent comet with @xmath44 au will have @xmath45 and @xmath46  au .",
    "we thus release these particles with @xmath47 au .",
    "in addition , we only study particles ejected from orbits similar to those of the _ returning _ occs with @xmath48 au . we do not consider orbits with @xmath49 au , corresponding to the oort spike au , which is known as the oort spike ( e.g. , wiegert & tremaine 1999 ) .",
    "comets in the spike are mostly dynamically new comets , on their first passage into the inner planetary system from the oort cloud .",
    "a comet that passes through the planetary system receives a gravitational kick from the planets .",
    "the typical energy kick , @xmath50 , depends strongly on the perihelion distance of the comet s orbit . according to wiegert & tremaine ( 1999 ) , @xmath51 au@xmath13 for @xmath52 au , while comets in the oort spike have @xmath53 au@xmath13 .",
    "depending on the sign of the kick , they will either leave the planetary system on unbound orbit , never to return , or be thrown onto a more tightly bound orbit with @xmath54 au . ] , because we believe it unlikely that disruptions could happen at the very large heliocentric distance implied by eq .",
    "( [ rstar ] ) for @xmath49 au .",
    "for example , a @xmath55-@xmath1 m particle with @xmath33  g  @xmath34 , released from a parent orbit with @xmath56 au , would become unbound , unless @xmath57  au .",
    "the particle populations studied here have bound initial orbits .",
    "they represent only a fraction of all particles released from occs .",
    "this fraction , denoted @xmath58 in section 4 , is difficult to estimate , because we do not have a detailed understanding of the processes , and their dependence on @xmath36 , that govern comet disruptions .",
    "we will return to this issue in section 4 .",
    "the initial distribution of orbital inclination vectors was set to be isotropic . to simplify things",
    ", we neglected the ejection velocities of dust particles from their parent objects ( see jones et al .",
    "2001 ) and assumed that they will initially follow the parent comet s orbit modified by radiation pressure .    for reference",
    ", we also followed meteoroids from 1p / halley , 2p / encke and 55p / tempel - tuttle .",
    "these comets were suggested to be important sources of the sporadic meteors by w09 .",
    "the comet s orbits were obtained from jpl horizons site .",
    "particles of different sizes were released from the parent orbits and tracked into future .",
    "we applied the same procedures / criteria to them that we used for the occ particles .",
    "the orbits of small particles in the interplanetary space are subject to gravitational perturbations of planets and radiation forces ( robertson 1937 , burns et al .",
    "the acceleration @xmath59 due to radiation forces is @xmath60 \\ , \\label{acc}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the heliocentric position vector of particle , @xmath62 is its velocity , @xmath63 is the gravitational constant , @xmath24 is the mass of the sun , @xmath64 is the speed of light , and @xmath65",
    ". the acceleration ( [ acc ] ) consists of the radiation pressure and the velocity - dependent p - r term .",
    "parameter @xmath26 is related to the radiation pressure coefficient @xmath30 by eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) .",
    "the particle orbits were numerically integrated with the swift_rmvs3 code ( levison & duncan 1994 ) , which is an efficient implementation of the wisdom - holman map ( wisdom & holman 1991 ) and which , in addition , can deal with close encounters between particles and planets . the radiation pressure and drag forces were inserted into the keplerian and kick parts of the integrator , respectively . the change to the keplerian part",
    "was trivially done by substituting @xmath24 by @xmath25 .",
    "the swift_rmvs3 integrator is stable even for near - parabolic orbits , and thus well suited for the integrations that we carried out here .",
    "the code tracks the orbital evolution of a particle that revolves around the sun and is subject to the gravitational perturbations of seven planets ( venus to neptune ; the mass of mercury was added to the sun ) until the particle impacts a planet , is ejected from the solar system or evolves to within 0.05  au from the sun .",
    "we removed particles that evolved to @xmath66  au , because the orbital period for @xmath66  au was not properly resolved by our 1-day integration timestep .",
    "several thousand particles were followed for each @xmath67 .",
    "their orbital elements were defined with respect to the barycenter of the solar system .",
    "the barycentric elements are similar to the heliocentric elements for @xmath68 au , but differ for large @xmath36 , where the sun s orbital speed about the barycenter of the solar system is not negligible relative to the orbital speed of a particle .",
    "all orbits were followed from the present epoch into the future .",
    "each particle s orbital elements were stored at @xmath69 yr intervals .",
    "we used the output to construct a _",
    "steady state distribution _ of occ particles in the inner solar system .",
    "this approach differs from that of nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and w09 , who started particles at many different past epochs and used these integrations to determine the _ present distribution _ of particles .",
    "the two distributions are expected to be slightly different expressing mainly the difference between the present configuration of planets , with each planet having a specific secular phase , and the time - averaged system , where all phases are mixed .",
    "since this difference is small , however , we can use the steady state distribution , which is easier to obtain , as a reasonable approximation .",
    "solar system micrometeoroids can be destroyed by collisions with other particles and by solar heating that can lead to sublimation and vaporisation of minerals . here",
    "we describe how we parametrize these processes in our model",
    ".      thermal alteration of grains in the interplanetary grains is a complex process .",
    "the occ particles evolving into the inner solar system will first loose their volatile ices , which will rapidly sublimate once the grains are heated to a critical temperature .",
    "we do not model the volatile loss in detail .",
    "instead , we crudely assume that the grains have lost @xmath1250% of their mass / volume when reaching @xmath70 au .",
    "we do not include the orbital effects of mass loss in orbital modeling , because it should produce only a relatively small perturbation on orbits for large particles that we consider here .",
    "the remaining grains will be primarily composed from amorphous silicates and will survive down to very small @xmath36 .    according to duschl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , silicates are thermally altered at temperatures @xmath71 - 1600 k , and start to vaporise for @xmath72 k. as an example of thermal alteration , kasuga et al .",
    "( 2006 , see also apek & borovika 2009 ) studied the thermal desorption of alkali minerals and concluded that micrometeoroids should show evidence of thermal desorption of metals , na in particular , for @xmath73 au .",
    "following moro - martn & malhotra ( 2002 ) , kessler - silacci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and others , we adopt a simple criterion for the silicate grain destruction .",
    "we will assume that they are destroyed when the grain temperature reaches @xmath74 k.    the temperature of a small , fast spinning grain in interplanetary space is set by an equilibrium between the absorbed and re - radiated energy fluxes . while the absorbed flux is a simple function of the particle s size , albedo and heliocentric distance , the re - radiated flux depends on the particle s emissivity , which in turn is a function of particle s size , shape and material properties . using the optical constants of amorphous pyroxene of approximately cosmic composition ( henning & mutschke 1997 )",
    ", we find that a dark @xmath75-@xmath1 m grain at @xmath36 has the equilibrium temperature within 10 k of a black body , @xmath76 k. according to our simple destruction criterion , @xmath77 k , the silicate grains should thus be removed when reaching @xmath78 au . on the other hand , the smallest particles considered in this work , @xmath79 @xmath1 m , will reach @xmath80 k for @xmath81 au . thus , we opted for using a very simple ( and conservative ) criterion where particles of all sizes were destroyed , and not considered for statistics , if they ever reached @xmath82 au .",
    "note that , by design , this limit is the same as the one imposed by the integration timestep ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "the collisional lifetime of meteoroids , @xmath83 , was taken from grn et  al .",
    "( 1985 ; hereafter g85 ) .",
    "it was assumed to be a function of particle mass , @xmath84 , and orbital parameters , mainly @xmath85 and @xmath35 .",
    "we neglected the effect of orbital inclination on @xmath83 , because the results discussed in steel & elford ( 1986 ) suggest that the inclinations should affect @xmath83 only up to a factor of @xmath122 - 5 , which is not overly significant in the context of our work .",

    "initially , the particle s semimajor axis underwent a random walk caused by indirect planetary perturbations , mainly from jupiter , during each perihelion passage ( wiegert & tremaine 1999 ) .",
    "then , at time @xmath149 yr , a single perihelion passage produced a significant drop of @xmath85 from 150 to 40 au , where the particle started to interact with the exterior mean motion resonances with neptune .",
    "the following evolution was mainly controlled by p - r drag . eventually , the orbit decoupled from jupiter , reached @xmath150 au , and kept shrinking further toward the sun , where the particle was thermally destroyed .",
    "the large oscillations of @xmath8 for @xmath151 myr , correlated with those in @xmath124 , were produced by kozai dynamics ( e.g. , kozai 1962 ) .    the orbit history shown in fig .",
    "[ orb1 ] is typical for an occ particle that is able to make it into the inner solar system .",
    "these particles , however , represent a relatively small fraction of the initial population , with most particles being ejected from the solar system by planetary perturbations . using @xmath19 with @xmath22 ( section 2.1 ) ,",
    "@xmath152 au and isotropic distribution of inclination vectors , roughly 0.8 - 1.5 % of particles with @xmath43 @xmath1 m evolve down into the inner solar system and decouple from jupiter ( as defined by the aphelion distance @xmath153 au ) , without being disrupted by an impact ( with standard @xmath154 ; section 2.3 ) or ever having @xmath155 au ( to avoid sublimation ) .",
    "these particles can potentially be important for the terrestrial impact record and interpretation of the meteor radar data .",
    "the bulk of occ particles that do not reach @xmath150 au , do not significantly contribute to the earth s accretion , because these particles spend most of their lifetimes at @xmath156 au .",
    "the fraction of occ particles reaching @xmath150 au , @xmath157 , normalized to the number of particles whose orbits were initially bound ( see section 2.1 ) , is sensitive to particle size . for @xmath79 @xmath1 m , @xmath19 described in section 2.1 , and initial @xmath152 au , @xmath158 . for @xmath55 @xmath1 m , on the other hand , @xmath159",
    "moreover , for @xmath160 mm , only one particle out of the total of 5000 reached @xmath150 au .",
    "this trend , with the larger particles having progressively smaller @xmath157 values , has interesting implications for the observations of sporadic meteors ( section 4 ) .",
    "the above estimates used @xmath83 as described in section 2.3.2 .",
    "collisional disruption , however , turned out to have only a modest effect for the standard g85",
    "s @xmath83 ( @xmath154 ) and the particle sizes considered here . for example , only @xmath122% of particles with @xmath43  @xmath1 m that reached @xmath150 au in our numerical integration have disrupted prior to decoupling from jupiter , as detected in post - processing of the integration output , with the standard g85",
    "s @xmath83 .",
    "a great majority of particles with @xmath55 @xmath1 m also survived .",
    "the effect of disruptive collisions becomes more significant for @xmath40 mm , for which @xmath83 is significantly shorter ( section 2.3.2 ) and p - r drag is weaker .    the thermal effects discussed in section 2.3.1 turned out to be very important for all particle sizes considered here .",
    "for example , 75 out of 122 particles ( i.e. , over 60 % ) with @xmath43 @xmath1 m that ever reached @xmath161  au , previously had @xmath155 au , which is our crude threshold for the thermal destruction of particles .",
    "also , 68 out of 74 @xmath55 @xmath1 m particles ( over 90 % ) reaching @xmath161 au previously had @xmath155 au .",
    "the thermally destroyed particles are removed and the orbital histories after their disruption are not used for our analysis .",
    "these fractions are a direct consequence of the relative importance of planetary perturbations and p - r drag on particles with different @xmath67 and @xmath8 .",
    "the orbital evolution of a large particle on the occ - like orbit is primarily controlled by planetary perturbations .",
    "sooner or later , the planets will eject the particle from the solar system , unless the orbit shrinks and decouples from jupiter . to achieve this , @xmath8 of the particle s orbit must be very low , so that the p - r drag timescale is short ( see fig . [",
    "but if @xmath8 is low , it may easily drop below @xmath155  au , where the particle is removed , thus explaining why most _ large _ particles reaching @xmath161  au previously have @xmath155 au .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of particles with @xmath162 - 300 @xmath1 m reaching @xmath150 au is not overly sensitive to the initial perihelion distance , as far as @xmath163 au .",
    "this is because it is more likely to decouple if @xmath8 is low , because p - r drag is stronger , but this trend is nearly canceled , because particles with very low @xmath8 tend to drop below @xmath164 au and sublimate before they can decouple .",
    "particles with @xmath162 - 300 @xmath1 m and @xmath23",
    "au , on the other hand , tend to have very long p - r drag timescales ( e.g. , @xmath165 myr for initial @xmath44 au ; fig .",
    "[ wy]b ) , and are scattered by planets from the solar system .      here",
    "we discuss the expected distribution of occ particles in the inner solar system .",
    "figure  [ hist ] shows the number density of occ particles as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "as expected , the particle density increases toward the sun .",
    "the radial distribution of @xmath43 @xmath1 m particles can be approximated by a power law , @xmath166 , where @xmath167 for @xmath68 au , and @xmath168 for @xmath169 au .",
    "both these radial dependencies are significantly steeper than @xmath170 , expected for distribution of particles on nearly - circular orbits ( see , e.g. , dermott et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the relatively steep radial distribution is a consequence of keplerian motion of particles with @xmath140 . for @xmath171 ,",
    "the time spent by a particle on the keplerian orbit between @xmath36 and @xmath172 is @xmath173 .",
    "this leads to @xmath174 , if the expected number of particles , which is proportional to @xmath175 , is divided by volume @xmath176 . for @xmath177 , on the other hand , appropriate for large radial distances , @xmath178 const . and @xmath179 .",
    "thus , @xmath167 - 2 is expected for @xmath140 ( see also liou et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we find that the number density of occ particles at @xmath180 au is mainly contributed by the particles that orbitally decoupled from jupiter .",
    "this shows the importance of orbital decoupling for the distribution of occ particles in the inner solar system , and their accretion by the earth .",
    "specifically , most occ particles accreted by the earth are expected to have @xmath181 au despite the fact that their orbits started with @xmath182 au .    figure [ odist ] shows the distributions of orbital elements for occ particles with @xmath43  @xmath1 m and @xmath68 au .",
    "the semimajor axis distribution , @xmath183 , has a broad maximum centered at 0.5 - 2 au with @xmath184 au being the most common .",
    "@xmath183 decreases toward larger @xmath85 , because particles with @xmath185 au are coupled to jupiter , have short dynamical lifetimes , and do not spend much time at @xmath68 au .",
    "the peak of @xmath183 at @xmath186 - 7 au is produced by orbits in the exterior mean motion resonances with jupiter , which prolong the dynamical lifetime of particles by phase protecting them against encounters with jupiter ( liou et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the eccentricity distribution @xmath187 increases toward @xmath140 , which is expected because all orbits started with @xmath188 .",
    "the tail extending to the moderate and low eccentricity values is due to the dynamically long - lived particles , whose orbits decouple from jupiter and become circularized by p - r drag .",
    "the inclination distribution is also interesting as it significantly deviates from the initial distribution with @xmath189 ( fig .",
    "[ odist]c ) .",
    "the retrograde orbits are more common than the prograde ones .",
    "the preference for retrograde orbits is probably caused by gravitational perturbations from jupiter that are more effective on prograde orbits , because the encounter speeds are lower , and thus @xmath190 s are larger .",
    "the prograde particles should therefore have shorter dynamical lifetimes than the retrograde particles , which would explain their relative paucity in a steady state @xmath191 for @xmath68 au .",
    "interestingly , however , the particles that decouple from jupiter and reach @xmath150 au by p - r drag do not show a strong preference for retrograde orbits .",
    "in addition , the steady state @xmath191 lacks orbits with @xmath192 .",
    "we believe that this is a consequence of kozai dynamics ( e.g. , kozai 1962 ) .",
    "it is well known that the initially near - polar orbits will suffer large oscillations of @xmath8 driven by variations of the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "most of these orbits can therefore reach very low @xmath8 values , where the particles will be destroyed by thermal effects .",
    "indeed , by studying the orbital histories of particles that started with @xmath192 , we found that most of these orbits had @xmath155 au prior to reaching @xmath161  au .",
    "the steady state distribution of orbital elements of @xmath55-@xmath1 m particles is similar to the one discussed above . instead of having a single peak at @xmath186 - 7 au ,",
    "however , @xmath183 for @xmath193 au is more irregular showing many peaks and dips .",
    "apparently , since the larger @xmath55-@xmath1 m particles drift more slowly by p - r drag , they are more susceptible to capture in a large number of resonances ( liou et al .",
    "the second difference concerns @xmath187 , which is slightly more clumped toward @xmath140 for @xmath55 @xmath1 m than for @xmath43 @xmath1 m .",
    "the radiants of occ particles are located near the earth s apex ( fig .",
    "[ rad1 ] ) .",
    "this is logical because the retrograde occ particles , which come from the apex direction , have much higher velocity relative to the earth ( @xmath1260 km s@xmath13 ) than particles on prograde orbits .",
    "the retrograde particles therefore also have , according to the usual @xmath194 rule , rather large impact probabilities with the earth .",
    "in addition , the ionization cutoff used here ( eq . [ cut ] ) poses a rather strict limit on the mass of meteoroids that can be detected by smrs at low speeds .",
    "for example , a @xmath43-@xmath1 m particle with @xmath195 g and @xmath196  km s@xmath13 has @xmath197 , which is near or slightly above the detection limit of amor , and way below the detection limit of cmor .",
    "the model radiants form the south and north apex concentrations , just as observed ( e.g. , jones & brown 1993 , galligan & baggaley 2005 , campbell - brown 2008 ) .",
    "the lack of radiants within @xmath1210@xmath198 about the ecliptic is due to near absence of occ meteoroids with @xmath199 ( see fig .",
    "[ odist]c ) .",
    "the lack of radiants with @xmath200 ( or @xmath201 ) is the consequence of the inclination distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ odist]c that is depleted in orbits with @xmath192 .",
    "most north ( south ) radiants fall into an area on the north ( south ) hemisphere that has the characteristic triangular or half - disk shape . for @xmath43 @xmath1 m ,",
    "the centers of radiant concentrations are at @xmath202 . for @xmath55 @xmath1 m , the centers are at @xmath203 .",
    "this reflects the differences in @xmath191 between the populations of particles with @xmath43 @xmath1 m and @xmath55  @xmath1 m that we obtained in the model . for comparison",
    ", observations indicate that @xmath204 ( e.g. , galligan & baggaley 2005 , chau et al . 2007 , campbell - brown 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , the apex sources that we obtained in our model tend to be more stretched in both @xmath120 and @xmath121 than the observed ones .    while more modeling work will be needed to test things with a better statistic",
    ", the issues discussed above may indicate that a better fit to observations could be obtained if the retrograde source had inclinations closer to 180@xmath198 than the bulk of occ particles with @xmath205 .",
    "it is not clear how this could be achieved by tweaking the parameters of our model .",
    "instead , clues such as these seem to highlight the importance of known htcs . indeed , the two prominent active htcs , 1p / halley and 55p / tempel - tuttle , both have @xmath206 .",
    "they would therefore be expected to produce apex sources closer to the ecliptic than the bulk of retrograde occ particles ( fig .",
    "[ rad2 ] ) .    an interesting feature in fig .",
    "[ rad1]b is the presence of a ring that stretches to @xmath207 in longitude and latitude .",
    "a similar ring has been noted in campbell - brown ( 2008 ) , who suggested that the region inside the ring can be depleted in meteor radiants , except for apex sources , because the retrograde meteoroids with radiants inside the ring would have shorter collisional lifetimes .",
    "our simple collisional model can not reproduce this effect , because @xmath83 is independent of @xmath124 ( see section 2.3.2 ) .",
    "in addition , w09 suggested that the origin of the ring can be traced back to kozai dynamics , which confines the allowed radiants of particles on high - inclination orbits .",
    "here we confirm the w09 s result by isolating particles that contribute to the ring , and checking on their orbital behavior .    the impact speed of occ particles peaks at @xmath208 km s@xmath13 ( fig .",

    "while part of this discrepancy could be blamed on insufficient statistics in our model , it may also point to a more fundamental problem .",

    "in contrast , the observed apex meteors have nearly flat @xmath187 at @xmath214 , and show a slight depletion for @xmath215 ( fig . 13 in campbell - brown 2008 ) .",
    "the cause of these differences is unclear . to obtain lower values of @xmath35 in our model",
    ", the orbits would need to become more circularized by p - r drag before arriving to @xmath150 au .",

    "we confirm this by using @xmath217 , but a detailed match to the observed eccentricity distribution remains elusive .",
    "a detailed analysis of this problem is left for future studies .",
    "the observations of sporadic meteors show that the relative importance of helion / antihelion and apex sources depends on the sensitivity of the radar that is used to carry out such observations .",
    "the less sensitive smrs with @xmath218 , such as the harvard radar meteor project ( hrmp ; jones & brown 1993 , taylor & elford 1998 ) or cmor , detect @xmath123 - 10 times more helion / antihelion meteors then apex meteors ( see , e.g. , campbell - brown ( 2009 ) for comparison of different radars ) .",
    "the more sensitive radars , such as amor with @xmath219 - 0.01 , on the other hand , detect a relatively larger number of apex meteors . finally , the apex meteors are predominant in observations by the highly - sensitive ao radar ( e.g. , janches et al .",
    "2003 ) , because of their ability to detect small particles ( fentzke & janches 2008 , fentzke et al . 2008 ) .    this trend can be explained if the size frequency distribution ( sfd ) of apex meteoroids is steeper ( i.e. , if the number of meteoroids more sharply increases with decreasing size ) than that of the helion / antihelion meteoroids , because radars that are capable of detecting smaller meteoroids would then be expected to see many more apex meteors ( fentzke & janches 2008 ) . for example",
    ", the _ initial _ sfd of particles produced by disrupted occs ( or htcs ) could be steeper than the one produced by the sources of the helion / antihelion meteoroids ( presumably active and disrupted jfcs ; w09 , nesvorn et al .",
    "2010 ) . while this is a possibility that can not be ruled out by the existing data , there are also no indications that this might be true ( mcdonnell et al . 1987 , grn et al . 2001 , green et al .",
    "2004 , reach et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we propose that the predominance of apex meteors in ao observations is caused by orbital dynamics of particles released from occs ( or htcs ) .",

    "thus , the size dependence of @xmath58 is such that it can not increase the number of small particles relative to the large ones .",

    "this indicates that @xmath231 should have a _ steeper _ slope than @xmath232 .",
    "specifically , if @xmath232 can be approximated by @xmath233 for @xmath234 - 300 @xmath1 m , where @xmath235 is a constant , we find that @xmath236 , where @xmath237 for occs . this estimate was obtained with @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 au and initial @xmath48 au . the results for @xmath241 , applicable if @xmath83 were @xmath1210 times longer than in g85 , and for htcs are similar .    for comparison , w09 suggested that comet 2p / encke ( or an orbitally similar lost comet ) is the main source of helion / antihelion meteors .",

    "we therefore find that @xmath231 of apex meteoroids is expected to be steeper than that of helion / antihelion meteoroids , even if the initial sfd of particles released from the respective sources jfcs and occs / htcs were similar .",
    "this effect is produced by orbital dynamics of particles starting on different initial orbits . as we discussed in section 3.1 , the earth impact record of occ particles",
    "is mainly contributed by those particle that decouple from jupiter .",
    "since the decoupling efficiency , described by factor @xmath157 in section 3.1 , ramps up toward smaller @xmath67 , the population of small occ ( or htc ) particles is enhanced , relative to large ones .",
    "this effect is weaker for jfc meteoroids , for which the correlation between @xmath157 and @xmath222 is not as extreme . in the jfc case ,",

    "if they detect 3 - 10 times more apex meteors than the helion / antihelion meteors ( e.g. , campbell - brown 2008 ) , this would suggest that the sfd slope index difference between apex and helion / antihelion meteors is @xmath245 - 1.4 .",

    "<S> the oort cloud comets ( occs ) , exemplified by the great comet of 1997 ( hale - bopp ) , are occasional visitors from the heatless periphery of the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> previous works hypothesized that a great majority of occs must physically disrupt after one or two passages through the inner solar system , where strong thermal gradients can cause phase transitions or volatile pressure buildup . </S>",
    "<S> here we study the fate of small debris particles produced by occ disruptions to determine whether the imprints of a hypothetical population of occ meteoroids can be found in the existing meteor radar data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that occ particles with diameters @xmath0 @xmath1 m are blown out from the solar system by radiation pressure , while those with @xmath2 mm have a very low earth - impact probability . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate particle sizes , @xmath3 @xmath1 m , represent a sweet spot . about 1% of these particles </S>",
    "<S> orbitally evolve by poynting - robertson drag to reach orbits with semimajor axis @xmath4 au . </S>",
    "<S> they are expected to produce meteors with radiants near the apex of the earth s orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the model distributions of their impact speeds and orbits provide a good match to radar observations of apex meteors , except for the eccentricity distribution , which is more skewed toward @xmath5 in our model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose an explanation for the long - standing problem in meteor science related to the relative strength of apex and helion / antihelion sources . as we show in detail , the observed trend , with the apex meteors being more prominent in observations of highly sensitive radars , can be related to orbital dynamics of particles released on the long - period orbits .    </S>"
