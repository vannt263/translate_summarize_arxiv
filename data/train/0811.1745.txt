    "in the search of low - frequency acoustic modes , the usual peak - fitting methods , using individual-@xmath0 spectra , are naturally limited by the decreasing signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . instead , several pattern - recognition techniques have been developed in an effort to reveal the presence of the modes in the low - frequency range .",
    "we use here an adaptation of the rotation - corrected @xmath0-averaged spectrum technique which finds the best set of the @xmath5-coefficient splittings yielding the narrowest profile in the average spectrum ( salabert , leibacher , & appourchaux  2007 ) . before averaging ,",
    "each @xmath0-spectrum at a given ( @xmath6 ) is shifted by a frequency that compensates for the effect of differential rotation and non - spherical effects on the frequencies .",
    "a high snr can result from combining individual low - snr individual-@xmath0 spectra , none of which would yield a strong enough peak to measure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colps ] ) .",
    "this method , called collapsogram , has been applied to 3960 days of gong data and to 2088-day coeval observations of gong and mdi for modes with @xmath7 .",
    "acoustic modes down to @xmath8hz have been observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lnu ] ) and their parameters estimated by fitting the rotation - corrected @xmath0-averaged spectrum with an asymmetric lorentzian profile .",
    "rotational inversions were computed using the @xmath5-coefficients of the low - frequency p modes of low- and intermediate - angular degrees measured with the collapsograms in long times series of gong and mdi observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : inv0 ] ) .",
    "the inversions were carried out using an iterative method implemented to avoid the need to invert matrices ( recalling the ill - posed nature of the inversion problem ) . for details about the inversion methodology , see eff - darwich & korzennik ( these proceedings ) . only modes with @xmath1 and @xmath9  2100  @xmath3hz were used .",
    "the inversions of both mdi and gong data sets give consistent results and no significant differences are found when inverting 2088 days or 3960 days of data .",
    "since observational uncertainties are reduced by a factor proportional to the squared root of the number of days , it will be necessary to have extremely long series to find significant improvements in the rotational distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : rachel ] shows the rotational inversion of the low - frequency modes measured with the collapsograms combined with the mean of 35  @xmath10  108-day gong peakfind data ( using both the higher - degree and higher - frequency modes from peakfind ) .    , and their @xmath11 diagrams before and after shifting in frequency by the indicated estimates of the @xmath5-coefficients.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]     diagram of the low - frequency modes ( @xmath12 ) observed with the collapsograms in 3960 days of gong observations ( black ) and 2088 coeval days of gong ( green ) and mdi ( red ) observations .",

    "figure  [ fig : inv1 ] shows the comparisons between the rotational inversions using the @xmath5-coefficients obtained with the collapsograms and those measured by korzennik ( 2005 ) fitting the individual-@xmath0 spectra . in both methods , the same coeval",
    "2088 days of observations have been used .",
    "the effect of the differences in the low - frequency ( @xmath9  2100  @xmath3hz ) and low - degree ( @xmath1 ) splitting data sets between korzennik ( 2005 ) and the ones obtained using the collapsograms are translated to the internal rotational profiles .",
    "special care should be taken regarding the calculation of the observational errors when only clebsch - gordan coefficients are available ( eff - darwich & korzennik , these proceedings ) .",
    "small differences in the data sets result in the observed large discrepancies in the radiative zone at high latitude , due to a lack of sensitivity in these regions ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : inv1 ] ) .",
    "108-day gong peakfind data.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "we performed rotational inversions by using the @xmath5-coefficients of the low - frequency solar p modes of low- and intermediate - angular degrees ( @xmath4 ) measured in long time series of gong and mdi observations with the @xmath0-averaged spectrum technique ( also called collapsogram , salabert et al .",
    "we showed that the inversions of both gong and mdi data sets give consistent results and that no significant differences are found when inverting 2088 days or 3960 days of data .",
    "we also compared with the rotational inversions obtained by using the @xmath5-coefficients measured by korzennik ( 2005 ) fitting the individual-@xmath0 spectra and stressed out the importance on how the observational errors are calculated .",
    "this work utilizes data obtained by the global oscillation network group ( gong ) program , managed by the national solar observatory , which is operated by aura , inc . under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
    "the data were acquired by instruments operated by the big bear solar observatory , high altitude observatory , learmonth solar observatory , udaipur solar observatory , instituto de astrofsica de canarias , and cerro tololo interamerican observatory .",
