    "optical waves are an interesting and promising alternative to pure electric @xcite and magnetic fields @xcite to produce mechanical stress on fluid interfaces and deform them . + when focused light propagates through an interface separating two fluids of different refractive indices , photon momentum , which linearly depends on the refractive index , experiences a jump at the interface .",
    "this momentum jump induces a radiation pressure on the interface that acts towards the fluid of lowest optical index whatever the direction of propagation of the optical wave . + this surprising invariance property was first evidenced in the experiments of ashkin and dziedzic @xcite .",
    "their work was an attempt at giving an experimental answer to the abraham - minkowski controversy about light momentum s expression in a dielectric .",
    "the controversy arises due to abraham s and minkowski s predictions disagreeing as to whether the momentum carried by an electromagnetic field is increased ( minkowski ) or decreased ( abraham ) by the presence of a refractive medium .",
    "ashkin and dziedzic concluded that light momentum was consistant with the minkowski formalism ( see @xcite for a recent review on light momentum ) .",

    "while experiments have highlighted a rich phenomenology , the complete understanding of the physics of interface deformation induced by an optical wave is still in its infancy .",
    "this task is indeed made difficult by the coupling between the shape of the interface and the optical radiation pressure distribution as well as the dependence of the interface shape on buoyancy , capillarity , viscosity and optical properties of the fluids .",
    "while some effort has been dedicated to the description of buoyancy effects on equilibrium interface deformations of small amplitude @xcite ( i.e. linear regime where the deformation s height varies linearly with the beam power ) , very few studies have gone one to describe large amplitude deformations @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to investigate numerically the statics and dynamics of these large deformations for a wide range of refractive index contrasts , from very soft interfaces ( near - critical systems @xmath7 ) to more usual pairs of fluids ( water / air for instance , @xmath8 ) . in essence",

    "equation ( [ stressjump ] ) shows that the transient deformation depends on viscosities only through their ratio @xmath263 .",
    "+ in the case of the near - critical phases used in the experiments reported earlier , @xmath263 was varying from @xmath264 for @xmath208 to @xmath265 for @xmath210 .",
    "as @xmath263 was close to unity , no particular behaviour was observed in the transient regime .",
    "+ it is however possible to imagine experiments with larger values of @xmath263 .",
    "using viscous glucose - water / hexadecane or glucose - water / toluene and appropriate surfactants would enable to obtain a viscosity ratio of @xmath266 with @xmath212 and @xmath267 still allowing large scale deformations using a continuous laser beam .",
    "a theoretical study would thus be a very useful predictive tool for the design of realistic future experiments .",
    "for this reason , we investigate the effect of the viscosity ratio in the two limit cases @xmath268 and @xmath269 . +     ( left ) and @xmath268 ( right ) . @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",

    "figure [ viscous ] shows the evolution of the interface profile at different times for these two values of @xmath263 , keeping @xmath270 , @xmath271 and @xmath273 .",
    "+ in the case @xmath274 , we can observe a sharp transition from a bell shape ( @xmath275 ) , characteristic of a small deformation amplitude , to a needle shape ( @xmath276 ) .",
    "for @xmath268 , we observe that the transition towards the needle shape occurs later , the tip of the interface showing a rounded shape between @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "this shape transition can be further characterized by analyzing the time dependence of the reduced curvature of the curvature at the tip , @xmath278 shown in figure [ viscous ] , @xmath279 being an indicator of the spatial variation of the curvature .",
    "in fact , a needle shape has a sharper curvature variation with @xmath280 than a rounded shape ( see figure [ profils](f ) and ( h ) ) , which means that @xmath279 is larger ( in magnitude ) for the needle shape .",
    "we observe in figure [ viscous ] that for a given value of @xmath263 , @xmath281 initially increases until reaching a maximum at time @xmath282 ( @xmath283 , @xmath284 ) before decreasing toward the steady state value .",
    "this maximum is a signature of the change of the shape evolution that switches from a round tip to a sharp one corresponding to a needle shape .",
    "while quantitatively validated with experimental data in the nonlinear regime of deformation , our numerical resolution , based on a boundary element method , showed that new morphologies of a soft fluid - fluid interface deformed by a continuous laser wave emerge when fluids become contrasted . in the nonlinear regime ,",
    "where the radiation pressure and the height of the interface strongly depends on the relative refractive index contrast @xmath77 , we showed that the interface shape turns from a needle to a nearly - cylindrical finger shape . in the transient regime , we predicted that the characteristic time of the deformation increases when decreasing @xmath77 before reaching a saturation .",
    "these results show the strong nonlinear coupling between the radiation pressure and the interface deformation in both transient and steady state .",
    "it was shown that the physical feature explaining these results lies in the dependence of the radiation pressure on the incidence angle .",
    "an original experimental evidence of this dependence can be achieved when the beam axis is not perpendicular to the initial flat interface . in this configuration , the interface hump is attracted in the direction of light propagation in the nonlinear regime of deformation ( see figure [ oblique ] ) .",
    "+ finally , the influence of the viscosity ratio @xmath263 has been investigated for large scale deformations .",
    "we showed that the transition time of the interface from its initial bell shape to the steady shape increases with @xmath263 .",
    "+ all these results show that the morphology of nonlinear interface deformations driven by the radiation pressure of a laser wave is even more rich than expected , opening the route towards future original experiments .",
    "further developments on nonlinear effects , where a feedback coupling between deformation and propagation emerges , will extend deformation shapes to self - adapted ones as for liquid optical fibres @xcite and nipple - like shapes observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "they both involve light guiding within the deformation that modifies in turn the radiation pressure along the structure .",
    "this thorough analysis of optohydrodynamics provides the general frame to predict and anticipate further developments of contactless interface manipulation at the micrometer scale .    .",

    "when the beam is tilted , incidence angles on one side of the deformation ( here the left one ) are larger than in the other side . when they are sufficiently small to consider radiation pressure as constant all over the interface , the deformation remains symmetric ( top picture ) .",
    "when the beam power is increased , the growth of the deformation makes radiation pressure sensitive to incidence angles and then more efficient on the right than on the left .",
    "the deformation is thus attracted in the beam propagation direction and becomes non - axisymmetric ( bottom picture ) . ]",
