    "one of the most important events expected in particle physics in near future is unquestionably the discovery of the higgs boson . the data from the atlas and the cms experiments at the lhc and the dzero and the cdf experiments at the tevatron hint at the existence of a light standard - model - like higgs boson in the mass range of 115 - 130 gev/@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "if it is indeed the case , the discovery is expected to be declared within a year or so by the lhc experiments .    in the standard model ,",
    "the higgs boson is responsible for giving masses to both gauge bosons and matter fermions , via the gauge and yukawa interactions , respectively , upon the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "however , unlike the gauge interaction , the mechanism of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the yukawa interaction have been left untested . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a higgs doublet with its wine bottle potential , and its yukawa coupling to each matter fermion in the standard model are mere assumptions other than being the minimal mechanism to generate the masses of gauge bosons and fermions . in other words ,",
    "we know essentially nothing but something must be condensed in the vacuum to give the masses of gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "it is well known that the standard model can not describe everything in the universe .",
    "an example is the existence of the dark matter which occupies about one - fourth of the energy density in the universe .",
    "the non - existence of anti - matter is another example .",
    "since the gauge sector of the standard model is well tested , it would be natural to expect that some hints of physics beyond the standard model could be obtained via precise measurements of the higgs boson properties .",
    "the lhc experiments are likely to discover the standard - model - like higgs boson",
    ". however , their precision is most probably not enough to reveal details of the discovered particle(s ) due to high background environments of proton - proton collisions .",
    "thus , precise measurements of the higgs boson properties by an electron - positron collider and its possible options are crucial to uncover its detailed properties which might go beyond the standard model . the international linear collider ( ilc )",
    "has potential to study the properties of the higgs boson(s ) such as coupling strengths to gauge bosons and matter fermions including the top quark with high precision , thereby opening up a window to physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath5 collisions , high energy photon - photon collisions are possible at the ilc by converting the electron beam to a photon beam by the inverse compton scattering @xcite .",
    "physics and technical aspects of a photon linear collider ( plc ) as an option of the @xmath5 linear collider are described , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite . a schematic of the plc",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the higgs boson properties such as its two - photon decay width and cp properties can be studied in high energy photon - photon interaction and thus the plc plays complementary role to the @xmath5 linear collider .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the higgs boson can be singly produced in the @xmath6-channel process so that the required electron beam energy is significantly lower than that for the @xmath5 linear collider .",
    "one of the most important observables to be measured in the higgs sector is its self - coupling , since it directly relates to the dynamics of the higgs potential , _",
    "i.e. _ the mechanism of the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "for example , a non - standard large deviation in the self - coupling can be direct evidence for strong first - order phase transition of the electroweak symmetry in the early universe @xcite .",
    "[ aahheezhh ] ( a ) and ( b ) show diagrams of processes which involve the self - coupling in @xmath0 and @xmath5 interactions . recently , a prospect for studying the self - coupling at the ilc was reported . according to the study ,",
    "the self - coupling is expected to be measured with precision of 57 % with an integrated luminosity of 2 ab@xmath7 at @xmath8 gev @xcite .     and ( b ) : for @xmath9 .",
    "higgs boson self - coupling occurs at red points .",
    "]    measurements of the self - coupling at the plc were discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that contributions to the self - coupling to the cross - section of fig .",
    "[ aahheezhh ] ( a ) and ( b ) are different and measurements in @xmath5 and @xmath0 interactions are complementary from physics point of view .",
    "in addition , as a higgs boson pair is directly produced in the @xmath0 interaction , required beam energy is lower , 190 gev as described later , than that for the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "this nature is important when considering energy update scenarios of the ilc .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an order - of - magnitude estimation for background processes was presented . however , the cross - section for the @xmath10 boson pair production is @xmath11 orders of higher than that for the higgs boson pair production .",
    "the backgrounds from @xmath3 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 production processes are also large and have the same final state as with the higgs pairs for a low mass higgs boson , which predominantly decays into @xmath14 .",
    "given the situation , people had been skeptical about the feasibility of the detection of the higgs pair process at the plc .    in this work",
    ", we studied , for the first time , the higgs boson pair creation at the plc extensively with a parameter set of the plc based on an @xmath5 linear collider optimized for the light higgs boson of 120 gev/@xmath1 and the same detector simulation framework as used for the ilc physics analysis .",
    "we report details of the analysis , issues and prospects for the measurement of the higgs boson pairs at the plc .",
    "in order to choose parameters for the plc , we calculated the statistical sensitivity @xmath15 defined as @xmath16 where , @xmath17 is the deviation of the self - coupling constant from the standard model . the constant of higgs self - coupling @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the higgs self - coupling constant in the standard model . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the expected number of events as a function of @xmath17 and that expected from the standard model . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the cross - section of the higgs boson production as a function of @xmath17 and that of the standard model , while @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the integrated luminosity , the detection efficiency for the signal , the detection efficiency for backgrounds , and the cross - section of background processes , respectively . for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath15 is written as @xmath31 fig .

    "the cross - section of the signal was calculated according to the formula described in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of @xmath34 and @xmath35 as indicated in fig .",

    "black and red dots show the @xmath34 and @xmath35 cases . ]",
    "the parameters for the electron and the laser beams are summarized in table [ cain ] .",
    "it was designed to maximize @xmath0 luminosity at @xmath37 gev based on the tesla optimistic parameters @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of the laser was chosen to be 1054 nm , which is a typical wavelength for solid state lasers .",
    "the electron beam energy was chosen to maximize @xmath0 luminosity around 270 gev , while keeping the electron beam emittance and the @xmath38 functions at the interaction point the same as the tesla parameters .",
    "the luminosity distribution was simulated by cain @xcite , as shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath0 luminosity in the high energy region ( @xmath39 ) was calculated to be @xmath40 .",
    ".the parameters of electron and laser beams based on tesla optimistic parameters .",
    "the polarization of electron beam was assumed to be 100 % . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ cutsummary_cheat ]",
    "we studied the feasibility of the measurement of higgs pair creation at the plc , which is a possible option of the ilc .",
    "the optimum center of mass energy of the @xmath0 collision was found to be around 270 gev for the higgs boson with a mass of 120 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "we found that the @xmath41 process can be observed with a statistical significance of about @xmath42 for the integrated luminosity corresponding to 5 years of the plc running against the background process which has @xmath11 times larger production cross - section ( @xmath43 ) than the signal and other backgrounds which have the same final state ( @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) , if each track could be successfully assigned to parent particles ( or partons ) .",
    "our analysis showed , for the light higgs boson , improvement of the jet clustering technique is crucial to discriminate the backgrounds by invariant mass information rather than to improve the @xmath46-quark tagging efficiency .",
    "this fact is reasonable , because the @xmath47 background turned out to be suppressed by a simple @xmath46-quark tagging scheme since the @xmath10 bosons do not decay into @xmath46-quark pairs , while the @xmath13 and @xmath3 backgrounds can only be suppressed by their mass differences .    for further improvements ,",
    "vertex information from @xmath46-tagging analysis must be taken into account in jet clustering , thus they should be coherently developed .",
    "efforts in this direction are on - going as a part of the ilc physics study @xcite and significant improvement could be expected in near future .      the authors would like to thank ilc physics working group @xcite for useful discussions , especially y. okada for useful theoretical inputs",
