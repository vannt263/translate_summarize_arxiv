    "nearly a century after the discovery of the cosmic rays , considerable uncertainty remains regarding the sources accelerating these particles .",
    "it is believed that cosmic rays at the highest energies , above the `` ankle '' in the cosmic ray spectrum around @xmath0 ev , are accelerated by extragalactic objects such as gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . at lower energies ,",
    "the sources of the cosmic rays are likely galactic objects such as supernova remnants ( snrs ) , although to date there is no conclusive evidence for cosmic ray acceleration by any of these objects .",
    "the icecube neutrino telescope , now under construction at the south pole , attempts to detect very high energy ( vhe , roughly tev to pev scale ) neutrino emission from the accelerators of the cosmic rays .",
    "neutrino emission is expected from such objects , since the highly energetic environments required to accelerate the cosmic rays will likely contain matter or radiation fields with which the accelerated hadrons may interact before escaping the source .",
    "these interactions will produce charged @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons which decay to muon and electron neutrinos ( and antineutrinos , which we will not distinguish in these proceedings ) @xcite .",
    "the neutrinos oscillate over distance between their sources and the earth , leading to a general expectation of flavor equality at detection , although this is not guaranteed : deviations from flavor equality could provide a variety of information regarding the source environment or probe exotic fundamental physics . at earth ,",
    "vhe neutrinos which undergo charged or neutral current interactions with a nucleon can be detected via the cherenkov radiation emitted by secondary particles produced in the highly inelastic interaction .",
    "neutrino flavor identification is possible based on the topology of the cherenkov radiation : @xmath3 charged current interactions produce a highly energetic muon that travels for hundreds of meters or kilometers on a straight trajectory , leading to long straight tracks in the detector .",
    "electron neutrinos and neutral current interactions of all neutrinos produce localized showers of particles , leading to an approximately spherical emission of cherenkov light .",
    "tau neutrinos can produce a variety of signatures , depending on their energy and decay mode @xcite .",
    "the icecube telescope uses a cubic kilometer of the antarctic ice cap as the cherenkov medium to detect neutrinos , instrumenting the ice with a three dimensional array of photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) housed in digital optical modules ( doms ) .",
    "the completed detector will consist of 5160 doms attached to 86 vertical strings at depths between 1450 m and 2450 m below the surface of the ice cap .",
    "in addition , an extensive air shower array on the surface , known as icetop , will detect cosmic rays .",
    "the layout of the array is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] . at present ,",
    "59 strings are installed and operational , with the remaining 27 strings to be deployed in the coming two austral summers .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] is the amanda telescope , which operated as an independent instrument from 2000 - 2006 and was integrated into icecube from 2007 - 2008 .",
    "amanda consisted of 687 optical modules on 19 strings , with the bulk of the detector at depths of 1500 to 2000 m. the amanda optical modules were simpler than their icecube counterparts , with considerably smaller dynamic range and less ability to resolve individual photoelectrons . in 2009 , amanda was decommissioned and the first string of its replacement , deep core , was deployed .",
    "the bulk of the neutrinos detected by icecube are not produced in astrophysical accelerators , but rather in cosmic ray air showers in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "these atmospheric neutrinos constitute a diffuse background to the astrophysical neutrinos from the cosmic ray sources , but they also provide a useful calibration beam for the detector .",
    "it is also possible to use the high - statistics atmospheric neutrino data set to make a variety of fundamental physics measurements  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : atmflux ] shows the measurement of the atmospheric @xmath3 spectrum extracted from the amanda seven year data set , as compared to two theoretical calculations @xcite . the spread between the two calculations does not indicate the full theoretical uncertainty , as both models rely on physics inputs which are themselves uncertain .",
    "amanda observes a spectrum which is slightly harder and slightly more numerous than the models , although consistent with the central values of the calculations at the 90% c.l . in normalization and the 99% c.l . in spectral index .",
    "flux @xcite , compared to theoretical models ( lines ) and a measurement ( ggmr ) extracted from the super - kamiokande data @xcite .",
    "the flux measured by amanda is slightly larger and harder than the bartol calculation @xcite , but consistent at the 99% c.l . or better in each parameter .",
    "the total theoretical uncertainty is larger than the spread between the curves would suggest , due to uncertainties in measured parameters common to both calculations .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "the primary goal of icecube is to detect individual sources of astrophysical neutrinos produced by cosmic ray accelerators .",
    "such a source would be identifiable as a localized excess on the sky , normally with a harder energy spectrum than the atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "we search for sources using an unbinned ( likelihood ) approach .",
    "the true significance of deviations from the null hypothesis is assessed by generating an ensemble of background maps , using the real data set with every event scrambled in right ascension .",
    "figure  [ fig : amanda_ptsrc ] shows the signficances of each point in the northern hemisphere sky produced by amanda in seven years of operation @xcite .",
    "this data set includes 6,595 neutrino candidate events collected over 3.8 years of exposure ( after accounting for readout dead time between events and summer maintenance periods ) . the most significant point in the map",
    "has a pre - trials significance equivalent to 3.38@xmath4 ; a comparably significant point is found in 95% of scrambled background maps , indicating that the map is consistent with the absence of any neutrino point source .",
    "a similar search was undertaken using the 2007 icecube data set , containing 276 days of data from 22 strings taken between may 2007 and april 2008 @xcite .",
    "a total of 5,114 neutrino candidate events was observed , consistent with an expectation of 4600 @xmath5 1400 atmospheric neutrino events and 400 @xmath5 200 cosmic ray muons misreconstructed as upgoing neutrino events .",
    "the same likelihood method was used to analyze the data , with the exception that the angular uncertainty was estimated for each neutrino event based on the width of the optimum in the likelihood space used to reconstruct the direction of the event , rather than using a generical overall angular resolution for all events .",
    "the resulting map of significances is shown in figure  [ fig : ic22_ptsrc ] .",
    "the most significant point in this map has a pre - trials significance of @xmath6 ; using randomized sky maps and also accounting for the fact that an independent search for emission from a list of candidate sources was also conducted using this data set , the probability of observing such a deviation from the null hypothesis is estimated at 1.34% , consistent with a background fluctuation .",

    "the sensitivity of the ic22 search is significantly better than that of the amanda search , despite being based on a much shorter exposure ( approximately 9 months of data collected in one year of operation , compared to 3.8 years of data collected in 7 years with amanda ) .",
    "the instantaneous sensitivity of icecube , even when only one quarter built , is significantly better than that of amanda",
    ". the complete detector will be even more sensitive , a factor of five better than the present analysis with one year of operation .    a list of 26 potential neutrino emitters , known through their electromagnetic emissions ,",
    "was drawn up _ a priori _ , including agn , snrs , and tev gamma ray sources identified by milagro in the cygnus region @xcite ( now identified with gev pulsars or pulsar wind nebulae @xcite on the basis of correlations with the fermi bright source list @xcite ) .",
    "the likelihood ratio , as defined above , was calculated for each of these sources using the amanda data set .",
    "because there are many fewer locations of interest , this restricted source is less subject to statistical trials penalties than the full - sky search , and is thus somewhat more sensitive .",
    "a similar analysis was performed on the ic22 data , using an expanded candidate list of 28 sources .",
    "a selection of the results from these searches is shown in table  [ tab : ptsrc ] , including those with the smallest @xmath7-values in each search . in neither case",
    "are these @xmath7-values inconsistent with the background hypothesis : one expects to obtain @xmath8 for at least one of 26 sources in 20% of signal - free sky maps , and @xmath9 in 66% .",
    "the 90% c. l. upper limits placed on @xmath3 emission from the sources , assuming @xmath10 spectra and @xmath11 flavor ratios , are also shown in table  [ tab : ptsrc ] .",

    "the limit for the @xmath10 benchmark @xmath3 flux is @xmath12 gev @xmath13 s@xmath14 sr@xmath14 at 90% c. l.",
    "( assuming a @xmath11 flavor ratio ) , over a range from @xmath15 gev to @xmath16 gev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse ] .",
    "it should be noted that the analysis was sensitive to all flavors of neutrinos ; for a @xmath10 spectrum with flavor equality , the flavor ratio of the detected events would have been approximately @xmath17 .",
    "limits on specific theoretical models are calculated separately for each model and are omitted from fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse ] for clarity but are shown in table  [ tab : diffuse ] .",
    "searches for diffuse astrophysical neutrinos are also underway using data from the 22-string 2007 configuration of icecube ( ic22 ) and the 40-string 2008 configuration ( ic40 ) .",
    "the ic22 sensitivity of @xmath18 gev @xmath13 s@xmath14 sr@xmath14 is very nearly at the waxman - bahcall level , the benchmark diffuse flux level obtained by normalizing the parent proton population to the observed cosmic ray flux .",
    "the expected sensitivity from the ic40 data is well below the waxman - bahcall flux , indicating that the completed detector will probe astrophysically significant flux levels .",
    "in addition to neutrinos produced during the acceleration of cosmic rays , icecube would be sensitive to neutrinos produced in the decay of dark matter particles .",
    "for example , weakly interacting dark matter particles ( wimps ) such as neutralinos could scatter off nucleons in the sun and become trapped in the solar gravitational well , where they could produce high energy neutrinos through various annihilation channels .",
    "such a search is highly complementary to direct dark matter searches using heavy elements such as germanium or xenon , which seek to take advantage of coherent scattering of the wimp off the nucleons in the atom .",
    "if the nucleon - wimp scattering is independent of the nucleon spin ( si ) , then this coherence will increase the cross section @xmath19 by a factor of the square of the atomic mass of the target .",
    "however , if the primary coupling is spin - dependent ( sd ) , coherence is lost and the cross section @xmath20 will be much smaller . wimp capture in the sun , which is primarily made of light nuclei , provides a useful probe of models where the scattering is primarily spin - dependent @xcite .    it should be noted that , as opposed to direct dark matter detection experiments , in this indirect approach assumptions must be made regarding the annihilation products , which will affect the energy spectrum of the neutrinos emerging from such processes .",
    "the hardest spectrum would come from annihilations to @xmath21 ( @xmath22 for the lowest masses ) and the softest from annihilations to @xmath23 , so as limiting cases we assume the wimps decay exclusively to those particles .",
    "the actual annihilation cross section is irrelevant so long as the sun is old enough for the wimp population to have reached equilibrium , with captures balancing annihilations .",
    "searches for high energy neutrinos from the sun have been undertaken with both amanda @xcite and ic22 @xcite .",
    "the limits on the sd scattering cross section produced by these searches are shown in figure  [ fig : wimps ] , in the limiting cases of hard and soft annihilation spectra .",
    "limits from super - kamiokande @xcite and a number of direct search experiments @xcite are also shown , as well as the allowed mssm neutralino parameter space based on direct detection limits on the si cross section .",
    "tighter si limits would rule out only a limited region of the allowed space , so icecube provides a useful counterpart to future direct detection experiments .    ) and soft ( @xmath23 ) neutrino spectra .",
    "the shaded region indicates the mssm parameter space allowed by existing limits on the corresponding spin - independent cross section predicted for that combination of susy parameters .",
    "the thin green shaded region would be ruled out if existing limits on @xmath19 are improved by a factor of @xmath24.,width=302 ]    in the future , the low energy response of the icecube detector will be greatly augmented by the addition of the deep core low energy extension , visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] .",
    "deep core will comprise the seven innermost standard icecube strings , as well as six new strings deployed in a ring of radius 72 m around the central string .",
    "the six new strings will each mount 60 doms , 50 of which will be deployed on a 7 m spacing between 2100 m and 2450 m below the surface .",
    "the remaining 10 doms will be deployed at shallower depths to improve the efficiency of detection of extremely vertical background muons . with a radius of 125 m and a height of 350 m ,",
    "the instrumented volume of deep core will instrument 15 mton of ice , with expected sensitivity to neutrinos at energies as low as @xmath2510 gev .",
    "the new doms will be identical to standard icecube doms except that they will use a new model of pmt developed by hamamatsu to increase the quantum efficiency of the photocathode .",
    "lab tests with assembled doms indicate the sensitivity of the high - qe pmts is approximately 30% higher than that of standard doms .",
    "the denser dom spacing and higher dom sensitivity combined will increase the collection of photons in the deep core volume by approximately a factor of 5 .",
    "furthermore , the ice at deep core depths is significantly more transparent than that at shallower depths , with optical attenuation lengths of 4045 m compared to 2025 m in the top of the detector . the significantly improved light collection in deep core translates to much higher sensitivity to relatively dim , low energy neutrino events .",
    "additionally , the bulk of icecube can be used to detect and veto atmospheric muons penetrating to deep core .",
    "the ratio of the atmospheric muon trigger rate to the atmospheric neutrino trigger rate in icecube is approximately @xmath26 ; initial monte carlo studies indicate that veto efficiencies on this order are achievable with relatively good signal efficiency .",
    "the first of the six new deep core strings was successfully deployed at south pole in the 2008 - 09 austral summer .",
    "preliminary evaluations of the performance of the hardware _ in situ _ confirm expectations from laboratory studies .",
    "deployment of the remaining five new strings , as well as the standard strings that compose the deep core array , is scheduled to be complete by february 2010 .",
    "deep core will enable study of a number of topics in neutrino physics and searches for neutrinos from point sources in the southern sky , including the galactic center region .",
    "it will also greatly improve the sensitivity of icecube to low - mass wimps . a preliminary sensitivity curve for deep core using 1800 days of data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wimps ] .",
    "icecube construction is proceeding well , with completion expected in 2011 .",
    "icecube will be augmented with the deep core array , to be completed in 2010 , which will extend its capabilities to energies as low as 10 gev .",
    "initial results from the partially built detector , including only one quarter of the final array , are already providing sensitivities beyond those of the complete seven - year amanda - ii data set , and this sensitivity will improve rapidly as construction progresses . within a few years",
    "the sensitivity of icecube will be sufficient to probe astrophysical neutrino fluxes below the waxman - bahcall level .",
    "in addition , icecube and deep core will permit indirect searches for dark matter well beyond existing limits .",
