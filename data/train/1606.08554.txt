    "over the last two decades quantum information and quantum computation sciences have experienced an extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress @xcite . in particular , the possibility of performing quantum information processing and quantum simulation tasks in archetypal many - body systems such as spin arrays has attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the recent noticeable advances in control techniques of quantum systems have made it possible to engineer and simulate spin interactions by means of cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , superconducting josephson junctions @xcite or trapped ions @xcite , leading to an ever increasing interest in these strongly correlated systems .    in this framework",
    ", it is well known that the exact eigenstates of interacting spin systems in the presence of an external magnetic field are typically entangled states .",
    "however , one of the most exceptional features of these systems is that under certain conditions they can posses a completely separable ground state ( gs ) , i.e. , a _",
    "factorized _ gs which can be expressed as the product of single spin states @xcite .",
    "the remarkable phenomenon of factorization has been thoroughly studied in spin systems immersed in a uniform transverse field @xcite , and in finite anisotropic @xmath1 spin chains the transverse factorizing field has been shown @xcite to correspond to a gs @xmath2 parity transition , the ensuing separable gs being two - fold degenerate . recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied @xmath1 models with uniform nontransverse fields , where it was shown that a uniform , maximally aligned , nondegenerate , completely separable gs can exist in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic - type systems for fields parallel to a principal plane of the coupling .    in this work we show that if some control over the couplings or the fields is feasible , then completely separable exact ground states can be engineered in general @xmath1-type systems .",
    "this point is important for the first basic step in most quantum information processes @xcite and quantum simulation schemes @xcite , since they are based on an initial fully separable state of the qubits , assumed to be reached with high fidelity .",
    "whenever such initial state is only approximately achieved or is prone to decoherence , additional error correction must be implemented @xcite .",
    "therefore , the possibility of having an exactly separable gs at _ finite _ magnetic fields _ even in the presence of strong interactions between the spins _ , is highly desirable , specially if such gs is nondegenerate and can be well separated from the remaining spectrum",
    ". such possibility can be also useful in schemes for quantum annealing @xcite .",
    "we first show that for arbitrary alignment directions at each site , compatible nonzero @xmath1 couplings between any pair of spins and concomitant _ finite _ factorizing fields always exist such that the separable state is an exact eigenstate of the system .",
    "moreover , such state can always be made a nondegenerate well separated gs by appropriately tuning the fields .",
    "in addition , it is shown , remarkably , that for an arbitrary quadratic coupling between two spins and an arbitrarily chosen spin alignment direction of one of the spins , there is always an alignment direction of the remaining spin compatible with an exactly separable eigenstate . this result enables to engineer separable gs in systems with arbitrary first neighbor couplings at least in one - dimensional - type geometries , if fields can be tuned .",
    "furthermore , the factorizing fields for a single pair can be always chosen as _ uniform _ , though in general nontransverse .",
    "a complexity classification scheme for the control required on the couplings and fields is accordingly introduced .",
    "this general framework also allows to identify and prove the existence of nontrivial separable eigenstates for certain couplings , fields and geometries , like the spin - spiral - type solution which will be discussed .",
    "we also suggest two experimental implementations for which the proposed methods could be realized .",
    "a final but not less important aspect is that the present general factorization points , arising for not - necessarily uniform couplings and non - transverse fields , can also be associated to an entanglement transition : pairwise entanglement , though obviously vanishing at factorization , will be shown to reach _ full range _ in its vicinity if either the fields _ or couplings _ are perturbed , in agreement with previous results for uniform fields @xcite .    the general rigorous results are presented and demonstrated in sec .  [ 2 ] and the appendix .",
    "special examples of factorized eigenstates are discussed in sec .  [ 3 ] .",
    "the ensuing gs engineering schemes , complexity classification , and experimental implementation are discussed in [ 4 ] .",

    ", the exchange couplings can be tuned if direct current superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) are used to couple the flux qubits @xcite , whilst the direction and strength of the local magnetic fields are controlled by the phases and amplitudes , respectively , of microwave driving fields .",
    "realizations of chains with first neighbor tunable @xmath228 couplings , not necessarily uniform , in nontransverse and nonuniform fields have also been recently reported using planar transmon qubits ( a type of superconducting charge qubits ) @xcite .    _ trapped ions .",
    "_ when interacting with lasers , trap ions can simulate @xmath1 effective spin systems in nontransverse magnetic fields . trapped ions methods are highly controllable , versatile and present long decoherence times and high readout precision .",
    "when simulating interacting spin systems , the exchange couplings and the effective magnetic fields can be tuned by controlling the lasers acting on the internal transition of the ions @xcite .    in these systems , once the nondegenerate separable gs is obtained it can be used in actual computing instances which require an initial fully separable state , as in standard models for quantum computation and quantum simulation @xcite . in particular , in typical quantum annealing , one starts from a known separable gs of a trivial noninteracting hamiltonian ( usually @xmath229 ) which is then continuously driven to a target interacting hamiltonian whose nontrivial gs is sought @xcite ( normally an ising type hamiltonian @xmath230 ) .",
    "thus , the previous factorization schemes enable to think of annealing protocols with always - on interactions in which just a part of the original hamiltonian is quenched .",
    "for instance , one could start from a convenient maximally aligned uniform separable gs in an @xmath1 system with a nontransverse field , such that the gs is well gapped , and continuously decrease the field along the @xmath73-axis and the @xmath231 terms leaving the sought ising hamiltonian .",
    "additionally , quantum annealing could be used in principle to obtain the gs of a complex hamiltonian starting from a separable gs by an analogous process ( i.e. , just modifying the fields , initially at suitable factorizing values ) . in particular , in chains with _ fixed _",
    "arbitrary first neighbor couplings , lemma 3 and lemma 1 ensure the existence of ( multiple ) completely separable gapped gs if the fields are adequately tuned , entailing that the previous annealing could always be applied .",
    "we have presented a novel approach to the problem of factorization , showing the possibility of starting from the state and determining the compatible couplings and fields .",
    "this approach opens the way to separable ground state engineering in interacting spin systems if some control over the couplings ( assumed quadratic ) and fields is feasible . for a fully separable state with _",
    "arbitrary _ spin alignment directions at each site , nonzero couplings between any selected pairs ( which can be all pairs or just some pairs ) and finite fields at each site always exist such that the ensuing hamiltonian has such state as a nondegenerate gs . in this way , some noticeable separable eigenstates ( like the spin - spiral solution ) were easily identified in @xmath124 chains .",
    "in addition , in open one - dimensional systems of @xmath3 spins with arbitrary first neighbor couplings , at least one ( and typically many ) exactly separable gs compatible with an arbitrary spin direction at one site is always feasible if the fields can be tuned at each site . and for a single pair , the field can always be chosen as uniform . furthermore , pairwise entanglement reaches full range in the immediate vicinity of factorization ( for perturbations in the fields or couplings ) , regardless of the type of solution , indicating that even in the present general setting factorization can still be considered as an entanglement critical point . these results , while providing useful insight into interacting spin systems and models without analytical solution , enable to devise separable ground state engineering methods which could be used in quantum information protocols and quantum annealing .",
