    "let the cyclic group @xmath15 of order @xmath134 generated by @xmath112 act on @xmath12 .",

    "the cases other than facets are not determined for lack of feasible polynomials @xmath20 , although we believe that the cyclic sieving phenomenon still hold once @xmath20 is found .",
    "in fact , we would like to point out that the _ genuine _",
    "@xmath46-analogue @xmath20 of the @xmath25-face numbers of the complex @xmath49 is quite elusive , as discussed below .",
    "as readers have seen , what we have ( i.e. , ( [ eqn : g(q ) ] ) , ( [ eqn : h(q ) ] ) , and ( [ eqn : d(q ) ] ) ) are feasible polynomials @xmath20 that serve the purpose of the cyclic sieving phenomenon . for the type @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we are more or less confident that the polynomial ( [ eqn : g(q ) ] ) , ( [ eqn : h(q ) ] ) are the genuine @xmath46-analogues of the number of facets of @xmath49 .",
    "however , our @xmath46-analogue @xmath20 in type @xmath3 ( [ eqn : d(q ) ] ) is still not so satisfying in the sense that it seems to be artificially tailored to serve the purpose of cyclic sieving phenomenon .",
    "we remark that in type @xmath3 same obvious @xmath46-analogues of the expression in theorem [ thm : formula](iii ) is not a feasible option .",
    "in fact , besides ( [ eqn : d(q ) ] ) we have found several other options of @xmath20 for type @xmath3 , each of them expressed in sums of several terms and serving cyclic sieving phenomenon well .",
    "a unified formula of @xmath25-face numbers of @xmath49 is found by fomin and reading @xcite to be @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 depends on @xmath37 , see @xcite for more information .",
    "however , except for the results presented in the previous sections , we can hardly derive any other feasible @xmath46-analogue ( for cyclic sieving phenomenon ) from obvious @xmath46-analogues of this formula , even for @xmath51 .",
    "for example , for @xmath138 and @xmath51 in type @xmath5 , by @xcite we have @xmath139 . taking a natural @xmath46-analogue , we have @xmath140_q}{[2]_q}\\equiv 3 + 3q+3q^2+\\cdots+3q^{13}$ ] ( mod @xmath141 ) , which does not agree with the orbit - structure ( i.e. , with two orbits of size 14 and two orbits of size 7 ) of the vertex set of @xmath142 under @xmath15 .",
    "what worse is that sometimes the natural @xmath46-analogue is not even a polynomial ( e.g. , taking @xmath51 and @xmath143 in type @xmath5 ) .    in light of these , we are very interested in finding a genuine polynomial @xmath20 that involves the coxeter number and exponents of @xmath37 in the sense of ( [ eqn : q - facet ] ) .",
    "such a polynomial @xmath20 should not only lead to a unified result for the @xmath25-faces of the complex @xmath49 as the one in conjecture [ con : csp - facets ] but also be consistent with other combinatorial structures ( e.g. noncrossing partitions ) in connection with coxeter groups .",
