    "there is a remarkable upsurge of interest in the nonlinear dirac ( nld ) models or equations , as they emerge naturally as practical models in many physical systems , such as the extended particles in particle physics @xcite , the gap solitons in nonlinear optics @xcite , bose - einstein condensates in honeycomb optical lattices @xcite , phenomenological models of quantum chromodynamics @xcite , as well as matter influencing the evolution of the universe in cosmology @xcite . to make the resulting nld model to be lorentz invariable ,",
    "the so - called self - interaction lagrangian can be built up from the bilinear covariants which are categorised into five types : scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , axial vector and tensor .",
    "different self - interactions give rise to different nld models .",
    "several interesting models have been proposed and investigated based on the scalar bilinear covariant in @xcite , on the vector bilinear covariant in @xcite , on the axial vector bilinear covariant @xcite , on both scalar and pseudoscalar bilinear covariants @xcite , on both the scalar and vector bilinear covariants @xcite _",
    "etc_. all of these models have attracted wide interest of physicists and mathematicians , especially on looking for solitary wave solutions and investigating their physical and mathematical properties .",
    "a key feature of the nld equations is that it allows solitary wave solutions or particle - like solutions  the stable localized solutions with finite energy and charge @xcite .",
    "that is , the particles appear as intense localized regions of field which can be recognized as the basic ingredient in the description of extended objects in quantum field theory @xcite . for the nld equation in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions ( _ _ i.e. _ _  one time dimension plus one space dimension ) ,",
    "several analytical solitary wave solutions are derived in @xcite for the quadric nonlinearity , @xcite for fractional nonlinearity as well as @xcite for general nonlinearity by using explicitly the constraint resulting from the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "most existing studies on the nld solitary waves focus on the situation with the self - interaction lagrangian constructed from one single bilinear covariant .",
    "for example , the soler model @xcite and the thirring model @xcite involve respectively the quadric scalar self - interaction and the quadric vector self - interaction , and further discussion about extending such two models to the situation with the integer nonlinearity is recently presented in @xcite .    with the help of the analytical expressions of the nld solitary wave solutions ,",
    "the interaction dynamics among them can further be conveniently studied and rich nonlinear phenomena have been revealed in a series of work @xcite . an important step in this direction has been made by alvarez and carreras @xcite , who simulated numerically the interaction dynamics for the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nld solitary waves under the quadric scalar self - interaction ( _ vide post _ ) @xcite .",
    "shao and tang have revisited this interaction dynamics problem @xcite by employing a higher - order accurate method .",
    "they not only reproduced the phenomena observed by alvarez and carreras but also observed that collapse happens in binary and ternary collisions of two - hump nld solitary waves .",
    "very recently , they have further investigated the interaction dynamics for the nld solitary waves under the linear combination of scalar and vector self - interactions with the integer nonlinearity and revealed that the interaction dynamics depend on the power exponent of the self - interaction in the nld equation , for example , collapse happens again after collision of two equal one - hump nld solitary waves under the cubic vector self - interaction in contrast to no collapse scattering for corresponding quadric case @xcite .",
    "their numerical results inferred that both the multi - hump ( two - hump ) profile and high order nonlinearity could undermine the stability during the scattering of the nld solitary waves .",
    "note in passing that , though multi - hump solitary waves have been found for many other nonlinear models , see _",
    "_ e.g. _ _",
    "@xcite and references therein , the detailed study of the multi - hump solitary waves of the nld model lacks except for the two - hump structure first pointed out by shao and tang @xcite and later gotten noticed by other researchers , see _ _ e.g. _ _  @xcite .    in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , the pseudoscalar and tensor bilinear covariants are linearly dependent , and",
    "a direct generalization of self - interaction is linearly combining the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial vector bilinear covariants with arbitrary nonlinearity , called by the linear combined self - interaction ( see eq .  ) .",
    "a natural question is raised here : how about the interaction dynamics for the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nld solitary waves under such linear combined self - interaction ? in answering the question , on the one hand , efficient and stable numerical methods are necessary in order to solve accurately the nld equation with the linear combined self - interaction in long time simulations .",
    "actually , we have demonstrated that both the runge - kutta discontinuous galerkin method and the exponential operator splitting method are fit for the job @xcite . on the other hand , more detailed information on the physical and mathematical properties of the nld solitary waves under the linear combined self - interaction",
    "is essential to investigating the interaction dynamics .",
    "the present work will focus on studying these properties and try to answer questions such as : how to choose the coefficients of the linear combined self - interaction to make the nld model be physically significant and have solitary wave solutions ?",
    "what parameters does the multi - hump structure depend on ?",
    "is the hump number related to the power exponent of the self - interaction ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the nld equation with the linear combined self - interaction is introduced in section [ sec : nld ] and the range of the combination coefficients is also determined there by the hermiticity requirement of the self - interaction . in section [ sec : solitary ] , the localized solitary wave solutions are analytically derived with the help of the conservation laws .",
    "the multi - hump structure of the charge , energy and momentum densities is analyzed in section [ sec : multi - hump ] where the upper bounds of the hump number in those densities are proved in theory .",
    "the paper is concluded in section [ sec : conclusion ] with a few remarks .",
    "this section will introduce the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nld equation with the linear combined self - interaction . throughout the paper ,",
    "units in which both the speed of light and the reduced planck constant are equal to one will be used , and the einstein summation convection will be applied , namely , summation over repeated indices .",
    "the nld equation has the following general covariant form @xmath6 being the euler - lagrange equation @xmath7 , where the spinor @xmath8 has two complex components , @xmath9 with superscript @xmath10 denoting the conjugate transpose , @xmath11 are gamma matrices ( we choose @xmath12 and @xmath13 as did in @xcite where @xmath14 are the standard pauli matrices ) and @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the imaginary unit , @xmath18 is the mass ( the nld model is called massive if @xmath19 and massless if @xmath20 ) , and the lagrangian @xmath21 reads @xmath22 here @xmath23 denotes the dirac lagrangian given by @xmath24 and the self - interaction lagrangian @xmath25 is a nonlinear functional of the spinors @xmath8 and @xmath26 but independent of @xmath27 , _ _",
    "e.g. _ _  a general linear combined self - interaction in will be considered in this work .",
    "physically , the self - interaction lagrangian @xmath25 is not only required to be invariant under the lorentz transformation ( see eq .  ) but also should be carefully chosen such that the resulting solution @xmath8 to the nld equation satisfies the following conservation laws @xmath28 where the current vector @xmath29 and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath30 are defined respectively as @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the minkowski metric .",
    ".   corresponds to the mass conservation , while eq .",
    "gives the energy conservation for @xmath34 and the momentum conservation for @xmath35 .",
    "according to eqs .  , , and , for the localized spinor @xmath8 , integrating the zero components of the current vector @xmath29 and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath36 yields three conserved quantities , _ _",
    "i.e. _ _  the charge @xmath37 , the energy @xmath38 , and the momentum @xmath39 , as follows @xmath40    as we have mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , the self - interaction lagrangian @xmath25 can be built up from the bilinear covariants and several nld models exist in the literature corresponding to different bilinear covariants .",
    "there are five types of bilinear covariants : the scalar bilinear covariant is @xmath41 , the pseudoscalar bilinear covariant is @xmath42 , the vector bilinear covariant is @xmath43 , the axial vector bilinear covariant is @xmath44 , and the tensor bilinear covariant is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 . in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , it can easily be shown that the tensor and pseudoscalar bilinear covariants are linearly dependent , _ _",
    "@xmath47 , and then the remaining four bilinear covariants are used to construct the following self - interactions @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are two components of the spinor @xmath8 , the superscript @xmath51 denotes the complex conjugate , and @xmath52 are the covariant gamma matrices .",
    "further more , direct calculation shows the relation between @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 and thus the general linear combined self - interaction can be formally written as @xmath56 where the exponent power @xmath0 is an integer , and the linear combination coefficients @xmath57 should be carefully chosen such that the resulting nld models are physically meaning ( _ vide post _ ) .",
    "for some special choice of the parameters @xmath58 , eq .   will reduce to the often - cited nld models in literature such as the thirring model @xcite and the soler or gross - neveu model @xcite .",
    "if the spinor @xmath8 is scaled by a constant factor as @xmath59 with @xmath60 , then the scaled self - interaction lagrangian will be @xmath61 $ ] which shows that the power exponent to @xmath62 is @xmath0 . in such sense",
    ", we call that the self - interaction lagrangian @xmath63 has the power exponent @xmath0 , for example , the quadric and cubic self - interaction are referred to the case @xmath64 and the case @xmath65 , respectively . the linear combination of the quadric scalar and quadric pseudoscalar self - interactions has been studied in @xcite , while the linear combination of the scalar and vector self - interactions with a general power exponent has been considered in @xcite . the linear combined self - interaction with @xmath64 has also been mentioned in @xcite .    obviously , the linear combined self - interaction @xmath25 in is lorentz invariant because each of @xmath66 is invariant under the lorentz transformation .",
    "accordingly , the only remaining physical requirement is to choose the linear combination coefficients in such that the resulting nld spnior @xmath8 satisfies the conservation laws and .",
    "it can readily be shown that the linear combined self - interaction satisfies the so - called homogeneity relation @xcite @xmath67 combining eqs .  , and gives that the conservation law is equivalent to the hermiticity of the linear combined self - interaction , _ _",
    "i.e. _ _  @xmath68 which poses a requirement the self - interaction must satisfy .",
    "multiplying eq .   from left with @xmath26 plus the conjugate transpose of eq",
    ".   multiplied with @xmath69 from right yields @xmath70 for eq .  ,",
    "and then we have a useful relation @xmath71 for eqs .  , and .",
    "in consequence , combining the homogeneity relation , the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath72 as well as the hermiticity requirement , and direct algebraic calculation leads to the conservation law .",
    "that is , the hermiticity requirement is the only condition for making the nld spinor @xmath8 under the linear combined self - interaction follows the conservation laws and .",
    "below we will use the hermiticity requirement to choose the linear combination coefficients in . before that",
    ", we would like to make a remark that the cases of @xmath73 and @xmath74 will not be considered in the following because the nld equation degenerates to the linear dirac equation when @xmath73 according to eq .  ,",

    "the range of the parameters @xmath84 in the linear combined self - interaction with a given integer power exponent @xmath0 reads as follows @xmath85 where the coefficients with which @xmath86 holds have been excluded .    in the next section , for @xmath77 , we are going to look for the localized solitary wave solutions for the nld equation with the linear combined self - interaction of a given integer power exponent @xmath0 under that the linear combination coefficients in eq .",
