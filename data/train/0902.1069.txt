    "progress in trapping and cooling of atomic gases @xcite made it possible to coherently couple a bose - einstein condensate to a single cavity mode @xcite .",
    "these experiments pave the way to a new sub - field of amo physics ; _ many - body cavity quantum electrodynamics_. in the ultracold regime , light induced mechanical effects on the matter waves lead to intrinsic non - linearity between the matter and the cavity field @xcite .",
    "in particular , the non - linearity renders novel quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "such non - linearity , due to the quantized motion of the atoms , is absent in the , so called , standard dicke model ( dm ) .",
    "explicitly , the dm describes a gas of @xmath0 non - moving two - level atoms interacting with a single quantized cavity mode @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the field intensity / energy , the free atom energy , and the interaction energy leads to a quantum phase transition ( dqpt ) in the dm .",
    "motivated by the novel phenomena arising from a quantized treatment of atomic motion , it is highly interesting to extend the dm to include atomic motion on a quantum scale , and in particular to analyze how it affects the nature of the dqpt .",
    "it is clear that such generalization of the dm results in new aspects of the system properties .",
    "the atomic motion is directly affected by the shape of the field induced potentials , which in return is determined by the system parameters and the field intensity .",
    "in addition to the terms contributing to the total energy in the regular dm , in this model we have to take into account for the motional energy of the atoms .",
    "this enters in a non - trivial way since the interaction energy depends on the motional states of the atoms .",
    "the dm was first introduced in quantum optics to describe the full collective dynamics of atoms in a high quality cavity .",
    "the dm hamiltonian , given in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , reads @xmath1 here , the boson ladder operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 create and annihilate a photon of the cavity mode , the pauli @xmath4-operators act on atom @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mode and atomic transition frequencies and effective atom - field coupling respectively .",
    "the dm is a well defined mathematical model for any value of its parameters .",
    "note , however , that whether this model describes faithfully some physical situation for any choice of parameters is not guaranteed . for moderate @xmath8 ,",
    "the dm appropriately describes the dynamics of atoms coupled to the cavity field , and it has been thoroughly discussed in terms of collapse - revivals @xcite , squeezing @xcite , entanglement @xcite and state preparation @xcite .",
    "considerable interest , however , has been devoted to the normal - superradiant phase transition @xcite .    in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 )",
    "the system exhibits a non - zero temperature phase transition between the normal phase and the superradiant phase . in the _ normal phase _ , all atoms are in their ground state and the field in vacuum , while the _ superradiant phase _ is characterized by a non - zero field and a macroscopic excitation of the matter .",
    "its critical coupling and critical temperature are @xcite @xmath11 as was shown in @xcite , the critical coupling can be seen as a condition on the atomic density @xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , the dqpt is of second order nature without the rwa , while it is first order if the rwa has been imposed @xcite .",
    "the corrections due to the rwa to various physical observables have been considered @xcite .",
    "more detailed analysis about miscellaneous aspects of the dqpt have been presented in numerous publications .",
    "especially various extensions @xcite as well as approximate methods @xcite concerning the dqpt has been outlined .",
    "recently , c. emary and t. brandes applied the algebraic holstein - primakoff boson representation on the dm .",
    "the method turned out to be very powerful and have since then been applied frequently to the dm @xcite .    despite the numerous publications on the dqpt",
    ", the existence of this phase transition was widely discussed .",
    "if the two - level atoms in the dm correspond to atoms in a ground and excited state , and the transition is direct , then quantum mechanics forbids the transition . this can be seen either by realizing the necessity of adding the , so called , @xmath13-term to the hamiltonian , or by employing sum rules to bound the coefficients in the dicke model to the `` trivial '' thermodynamical phase @xcite .",
    "the argumentation of ref .",
    "@xcite can be generalized to a quite general no - go theorem for the dqpt @xcite , but it does not apply if the two level atoms in the dm correspond to atoms in two excited states , such as rydberg states , or if the transition is not direct .    one valuable step towards an experimental realization of the dqpt was taken in relation with ref .",
    "@xcite , where typical experimental parameters as well as losses were included .",
    "these authors considered the two levels coupled by a non - resonant raman transition . in such conditions",
    "the atom - field coupling @xmath8 can be tuned more or less independently of the @xmath13 term in an effective two - level model , and one can reach the regime of dqpt .",
    "this paper , however , considers a situation in which atomic motion can be neglected due to high temperatures , _",
    "e.g. _ the standard dqpt .",
    "alternative situation , in which the atomic motion could be neglected , would be to consider quantum dots interacting with a cavity mode @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the dm to take into account for atomic motion in a fully quantum mechanical description .",
    "the atomic motion then introduces an additional degree of freedom to the problem , leading to novel appearances of the system phase diagrams .",
    "the gas is assumed dilute such that atom - atom scattering can be neglected , and that the motion is restricted to one dimension due to tight confinement in the remaining two directions via external trapping .",
    "furthermore , the atoms are assumed trapped by the cavity field itself .",
    "consequently , a normal - superradiant qpt is not possible , since for a vanishing field the atomic trapping capability is lost .",
    "however , we may assume a lowest bound of the field such that at least one bound state of the trapping `` potential '' is guaranteed .",
    "this can be achieved by an external pumping of the cavity , which imposes a non - vanishing cavity field .",
    "our research is partly carried out in the adiabatic regime , motivated by the ultracold atoms considered and its justification is numerically verified . in this adiabatic regime , the problem relaxes to solving a 1-d time - independent schrdinger equation .",
    "in particular we study the case of a gaussian mode profile utilizing this adiabatic method . the situation with a standing wave mode profile",
    "is also considered , however using a full numerical rather than adiabatic approach . for a gaussian profile",
    "the number of bound states is crucial for the thermodynamics , and we find great divergences from the regular dm . among these",
    "are the existence of both first and second order qpt s and multiple superradiant phases .",
    "the second , standing wave mode , shows slight similarities to the model of @xcite but the qpt is found to be of second order , and the pt survives for zero temperature and finite @xmath6 opposite to the regular dqpt .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the generalized dm which includes the motion of the atom .",

    "one may replace @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the evaluation of the partition function @xcite .",
    "in other words ; in the large atom number limit the photon ladder operators , or more precisely @xmath31 and @xmath32 , can be treated as commuting operators .",

    "provided that the adiabatic potentials do not cross , it is then legitimized to perform an adiabatic diagonalization of the internal states @xcite . in this regime",
    ", the single particle hamiltonian relaxes to two decoupled adiabatic ones @xmath37 this approximation will be imposed in the next section considering a gaussian mode profile .",
    "however , in the proceeding section dealing with the standing wave mode such an approach is not advocate , since then the curve crossings between the adiabatic potentials break adiabaticity @xcite .",
    "the justification of the adiabatic approximation applied to the gaussian mode profile will be discussed in the end of next section . within this regime ,",
    "the problem has become one of solving for the eigenvalues of two time - independent decoupled schrdinger equations .",

    "we note that for high temperatures the regular behavior is regained , while for low temperatures , and in particular zero temperature , a qpt takes place for finite @xmath6 .",
    "fixing @xmath6 instead and vary @xmath7 we get even more surprising results . in the regular dm , there is an upper temperature for which the qpt is lost and at zero temperature a qpt occurs for finite @xmath7 . in our model ,",
    "a similar phase - diagram is obtained for a range of parameters @xmath6 and @xmath8 , but there also exist parameter regimes where no qpt occurs for zero temperature .    like in the previous section the nature of the pts",
    "is studied by introducing the scaled field intensity @xmath84 maximizing @xmath130 .",
    "it is found that the qpt s are of second order character in all cases .",
    "in this work we have studied a new regime in the dm .",
    "the atoms are assumed trapped by the cavity field itself and ultracold such that their center - of - mass kinetic energy is of the order of the atom - field interaction .",
    "this calls for a full quantum mechanical treatment of the atomic motion and at the same time take into account for spatial mode variations .",
    "the analysis is motivated from our earlier findings , where we demonstrated that atomic motion greatly affects the system dynamics in many - body cavity qed systems @xcite .",
    "expectedly , we have shown that this is also true for the dm .",
    "the analysis is restricted to considering one dimensional problems , and both the case of a gaussian and a standing wave mode profile were treated .",
    "however , we motivated that similar phenomena are expected also for higher dimensional situations .",
    "in particular , we made evident that the varying number of bound states in the potential formed by a gaussian mode profile induces novel first order qpts .",
    "additionally , we found that for certain couplings @xmath81 , the system is superradiant for any field frequency @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , great differences with the regular dm was also encountered for a standing wave mode profile .",
    "here , we analytically consider the large field asymptotic expressions for the energy per particle @xmath130 in the case of a standing wave mode profile . in this regime",
    "one may utilize the tight binding approximation @xcite to derive the spectrum .",
    "we further assume the adiabatic approximation to be valid and that we can restrict the analysis to the lowest energy band .",
    "the adiabatic potentials are given by @xmath136 where @xmath129 is as before the scaled field intensity .",
    "a convenient base for writing down the periodic hamiltonian in matrix form is to use the wannier states @xmath137 @xcite . the function @xmath138 is localized in the @xmath139th `` well '' of the potentials @xmath124 . by the _ tight binding approximation _ we assume @xmath140 unless @xmath141 or @xmath142 . within the validity regime of this approximation",
    "we may as well replace the wannier functions by gaussian functions @xcite .",
    "the widths of the gaussians are given by approximating the potential wells by harmonic oscillators , giving @xmath143{\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{(x - x_j)^2}{2\\sigma^2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath144 and @xmath145 is the position of the @xmath139th potential well .",
    "to avoid un - physical contributions from the non - orthogonality of the gaussians we impose @xmath146 .",
    "we further introduce the matrix elements @xmath147 where we only consider @xmath148 .",
    "we note that the wannier functions are directly related to the depth of the corresponding potential and therefore their width @xmath149 will also depend on @xmath60 .",
    "this explains the field intensity dependence of @xmath150 .",
    "another important observation is that @xmath151 are localized where @xmath152 are close either to its maximum or its minimum , resulting in different coupling elements @xmath153 , indicated by the @xmath154-superscript . in this notation",
    "we get the lowest band tight binding energy @xmath1552\\cos(k ) .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the part in front of the cosine function is strictly negative resulting in that the ground state energy is given by @xmath156 .",
    "the kinetic energy integrals of ( [ couplings ] ) are readily solvable , and one finds @xmath157 the potential integrals of ( [ couplings ] ) are not analytically solvable for the given potentials ( [ adpotsw ] ) .",
    "instead we make the same kind of approximation as in section [ sec3 ] @xmath158 and identify @xmath159 within this regime we find @xmath160 we emphasize that the width @xmath161 depends on the field intensity @xmath60 ; @xmath162 the applied approximations are only reliable for @xmath163 @xcite , and it turns out that the qpts occur beyond these approximations .",
