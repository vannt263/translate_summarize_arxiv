    "over recent years perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) has shown impressive agreement with various inclusive measurements at @xmath10  colliders at many center - of - mass energies ( cme ) ranging from 14  gev up to 206  gev .",
    "these measurements utilised variables called event shapes or jet rates , see @xcite for such an analysis .",
    "these are inclusive variables , whose values are calculated from the four - momenta of all particles in an event .",
    "other properties , such as the momentum spectra of charged or neutral particles , have also been measured , but their prediction has proven to be more difficult .",
    "the necessary calculations have to cover the entire energy range from the production of the partons at the cme down to the scale of the hadron masses ( typically @xmath11 ) , at which hadronisation occurs . typically , powers of the form @xmath12 arise when quark masses are taken into account , making pqcd calculations difficult to interpret .",
    "attempts have been made to extend the applicable range of pqcd to lower scales .",
    "these attempts have to be validated , for example by comparing so - called fragmentation functions . due to the scaling violation of qcd , a fundamental property of this theory",
    ", the fragmentation function for a given particle depends explicitly on the cme .",
    "this energy dependence must follow the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite evolution equations .",
    "thus , the fragmentation functions have to be properly evolved .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) generators which include this scaling can be used instead of analytical evolution .",
    "common mc  generators which include this scaling are jetset @xcite , ( its variant ) pythia @xcite and herwig @xcite .",
    "these mc  generators are also needed to model hadronisation , the transition of partons into hadrons , which can not be calculated from first principles within qcd .",
    "various models are implemented in mc generators .",
    "these can be distinguished by comparing the ( identified ) heavy hadron momentum spectra predicted by each model to the spectra seen in data .",
    "fragmentation functions for heavy quarks are attractive both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "concerning theory , mass effects in the matrix elements only have to be considered for the heavy quark ; in the limit of @xmath13 , a pqcd calculation based on an effective lagrangian reduces the complexity of the calculation compared to the case of light quark fragmentation .",
    "experimentally , it is important to measure heavy quark fragmentation functions as their shapes are different from the corresponding functions for light quarks ; such a measurement is furthermore straightforward , as very often hadrons containing heavy quarks can easily be identified .",
    "since the production of heavy quarks is strongly suppressed in both the perturbative splitting of one parton to many partons ( the so - called `` parton shower '' ) and in hadronisation , a heavy quark found in an event will most likely be produced in the primary interaction .    at lep and sld ,",
    "@xmath14 quark fragmentation functions have been measured with high precision @xcite .",
    "these measurements found that these fragmentation functions are in fact close to the ones of light quarks , suggesting that one combined model for all five flavours might describe the measured momentum spectra better than functions which have been introduced for heavy quarks alone .",
    "these collaborations have also published measurements of @xmath15 quark fragmentation functions @xcite , but with large statistical uncertainties due to the small product of the branching fraction and reconstruction efficiency for the various final states .",
    "some commonly used fragmentation functions are described by the models of peterson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , of kartvelishvili _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and of collins and spiller @xcite , as well as by the models of the lund group @xcite and one of its variants by bowler @xcite .    for charm quark fragmentation functions at lower energies ,",
    "the most recent published results for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath6  and @xmath7  are those of cleo @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here has better statistical precision as the data sample is five times larger .",
    "other measurements are more than 10 years old @xcite ; their data sample is over three orders of magnitude smaller than that used in this analysis .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are reduced significantly and are comparable to those in @xcite . for a recent review of fragmentation function  measurements and theory , see @xcite .",
    "a measurement of @xmath2  and @xmath3  performed by the same experiment on the same data set allows for an easy comparison of charged meson production rates and momentum spectra , as well as a comparison of the momentum - dependent production of secondary- to primary - produced mesons .",
    "the measurement of the excited states @xmath6  and @xmath7  allows the determination of the feed - down contribution to the ground states @xmath2  and @xmath3  and also a momentum - dependent determination of @xmath16 , the ratio of the production rates of vector and the sum of vector and pseudo - scalar mesons .",
    "a comparison between @xmath4  production , and the production of @xmath2  and @xmath3 , can be used to determine the fraction of @xmath17 quark production in hadronisation .",
    "comparing the results for the @xmath5  to those of the @xmath18 mesons makes a study of the baryon production mechanism possible .",
    "in addition to charm fragmentation in the @xmath10@xmath19@xmath20 continuum , charmed hadrons in @xmath10  annihilation events can be produced in decays of b - hadrons .",
    "the dataset for this analysis includes events above the production threshold for @xmath21 pairs , at the @xmath9  resonance , so the lower momentum hadrons include contributions from @xmath22 and @xmath23 decays .",
    "this allows a measurement of the production rate of charmed hadrons in b - meson decay .",
    "this analysis uses data recorded at the belle detector at the kekb accelerator .",
    "the kekb @xmath10  collider is a pair of storage rings for electrons and positrons with asymmetric energies , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , and a single intersection point with a 22 mrad crossing angle .",
    "the beam energies are tuned to produce an available cme of @xmath28 , corresponding to the mass of the @xmath29 .",
    "a detailed description can be found in @xcite .",
    "the belle detector covers a solid angle of almost @xmath30 .",
    "closest to the interaction point is a high resolution silicon micro - vertex detector ( svd ) .",
    "it is surrounded by the central drift chamber ( cdc ) .",
    "two dedicated particle identification systems , the aerogel erenkov counter ( acc ) and the time - of - flight system ( tof ) , are mounted between the cdc and the csi(tl ) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) .",
    "all these sub - detectors are located inside a super - conducting coil that provides a magnetic field of 1.5  t. the return yoke of the coil is instrumented as a @xmath31 and @xmath32 detector .",
    "a detailed description can be found in @xcite .",
    "this analysis uses 87.7  @xmath1  of @xmath10  annihilation data taken at the @xmath9  resonance at @xmath28 ( `` on - resonance data '' ) , above the production threshold for @xmath21 pairs .",
    "additional 15.0  @xmath1  are taken 60  @xmath33  below the resonance at @xmath34 ( `` continuum data '' ) , which is also below the production threshold for @xmath21 pairs .",
    "hadronic events are selected as described in @xcite .",
    "the selection efficiency of events originating from light quarks passing this hadronic preselection has been estimated to be 84.0% , using @xmath35 mc events .",
    "for @xmath15 quarks , the efficiency has been determined with @xmath36 mc events to be 93.0% .",
    "the light quark sample contains almost no true candidates , reflecting the small rate for gluon splitting into open charm states , i.e.  two mesons containing @xmath15 quarks .    to estimate the efficiency of reconstructing charmed hadrons and to correct for distortions due to the finite acceptance of the detector ,",
    "mc  samples of @xmath37 events corresponding to a data luminosity of 217  @xmath1  ( approximately 2 1/2 times the on - resonance data ) , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath17 ) events corresponding to 18  @xmath1  ( approximately 1.2 times the continuum data ) , have been studied .",
    "the mc  samples were generated using the qq98 generator @xcite employing the peterson fragmentation function for @xmath15 quarks and were processed through a detailed detector simulation based on geant 3.21 @xcite .",
    "this sample will be referred to as the generic sample .",
    "special samples of several million @xmath37 events were generated with the evtgen @xcite generator using the peterson as well as the bowler fragmentation functions and were also run through the detector simulation .",
    "these samples will be referred to as reweighted samples ; see section [ mc ] for details about the reweighting procedure . for each charmed hadron used in this analysis ,",
    "a sample was generated where that hadron was forced to decay in the same channel as later reconstructed .",
    "these samples were reconstructed using the same procedures as for data .      to minimise possible kinematic biases due to tight selection criteria for identified particles , only loose cuts on the particle identification of the stable particles",
    "have been applied .",
    "all particles with mean lifetime longer than @xmath41 have been called `` stable '' . apart from reducing a potential kinematic bias , this increased the reconstruction efficiency at the cost of introducing more background , especially in the low momentum region .",
    "in general , the identification for each track was based on one or more likelihood ratios , which combined the information from the time - of - flight and erenkov counters and the energy loss de / dx in the drift chamber .",
    "pions and kaons were separated by a single likelihood ratio @xmath42 .",
    "charged particles were identified as pions if this ratio was less than 0.95 and as kaons if this ratio was larger than 0.05 .",
    "this overlap allowed a charged particle to be identified as both a pion and a kaon , potentially resulting in identifying a mother ( candidate ) particle as its own anti - particle ( _ i.e. , _  a @xmath43  decay could be identified as a @xmath44  decay ) , and therefore overestimating the number of candidates . as this misidentification was only possible for neutral particles",
    ", an additional systematic uncertainty has been assigned for the @xmath2  and @xmath6 ; see section [ systematics ] for details .    for proton identification",
    ", similar likelihood ratios were required to fulfil and . for the @xmath45 ,",
    "photon candidates with energies above 30 mev were combined to form a @xmath45  candidate . under the assumption that the @xmath45  candidate decayed at the interaction point , it was required to have an invariant mass consistent with the @xmath45  mass .",
    "the efficiencies @xmath46 and misidentification probabilities @xmath47 for tracks from signal candidates under these cuts have been measured in data , and are listed in table [ eff ] ; in all cases except the proton , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for kaons and pions",
    "the efficiencies and misidentification probabilities have been estimated in bins of the particle s momentum from @xmath7  and subsequent @xmath2@xmath19@xmath50@xmath51  decays ; for protons , @xmath52 decays have been used .",
    "the observed momentum spectra in data have been used to derive the listed numbers .",
    ".[eff ] typical efficiencies and misidentification probabilities for tracks from signal candidates used in this analysis .",
    "the misidentification probabilities listed under @xmath53 means the probability of mis - identifying it as a @xmath54 . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for data and mc , the @xmath55  distributions were compared using uncorrected data and the reweighted special mc  samples after full detector simulation .",
    "a @xmath56 was calculated based upon the distribution of the reweighted special sample and the measured data distribution .",
    "only statistical uncertainties in each @xmath55  bin were taken into account and only bins which contained entries in data or mc  were included .",
    "the number of bins minus the number of parameters of the fragmentation function  was used as the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the weights in the reweighting procedure were constructed in such a way that the number of events before and after reweighting stayed constant . this way",
    "the total value of the @xmath56 becomes dependent on the size of the data and mc  samples ; the relative @xmath56 values , however , allow a direct comparison between the different fragmentation function s.    table [ frf ] shows the @xmath58 for all five particles and five fragmentation functions .",
    "for all five particles a similar trend is visible .",
    "the bowler model in general agrees best with the data .",
    "the lund models shows a similar performance in describing the spectra , its @xmath58 being by factors of 23 better than the next best model . for @xmath3  and @xmath7",
    "the @xmath58 is slightly worse than for the bowler model . in the minimum of the @xmath59 distributions",
    "the @xmath60 parameter deviates strongly from the default for most of the particles .",
    "as the lund model is employed for fragmentation of all flavour species , such a large change in the parameter would also change the particle spectrum of light mesons .",
    "therefore , further tuning of the second parameter to the lund fragmentation function has been omitted .",
    "the models by collins and spiller and by kartvelishvili show a similar @xmath61 for all particles , about factors of two to three worse than that of the best models . the last model , that of peterson , shows the worst agreement with a reduced @xmath61 of 15 and well above , ruling out this model for describing data at this cme .",
    "the input parameters for the fragmentation functions at the minimum of the @xmath59 distributions are listed in table [ frf - par ] .    in summary ,",
    "the bowler model shows the best agreement between data and mc , however , large differences are still present .",
    "these differences might be resolved by adjusting other parameters of the generators as well , but such a task is out of scope for this analysis .",
    "the lund model shows the second best agreement .",
    "the models by kartvelishvili and by collins and spiller show larger deviations and the commonly used model by peterson shows the worst agreement between data and mc .",
    "a new determination of the charm fragmentation function at a cme close to the @xmath9  resonance has been presented .",
    "the measured @xmath55  spectra have been compared to those of five different parametrisations in mc  via a reweighting procedure , and the best input parameters have been found .",
    "the best agreement between data and mc  has been found for the bowler model and the lund model . additionally , the peak positions and the first six moments of the @xmath55 distributions have been measured .",
    "these measurements will allow detailed comparisons between experiment and theory .",
    "the total production cross - section , as well as @xmath55  dependent ratios of the fragmentation functions , place stringent tests on existing mc  generators , which so far completely fail to describe the @xmath55  dependent ratios of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "for the first time , the production rates of @xmath3  and @xmath2  excluding the decay of @xmath64 mesons have been measured .",
    "they were found to agree reasonably well with each other .",
    "the efficiency corrected data points will be made available via download in the durham hep reaction data database @xcite .",
    "it is presented in a different way as shown this article .",
    "separate sets of the continuum and the on - resonance samples are given as @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. _ scaled by the nominal center - of - mass energies of 10.52 @xmath0  and 10.58 @xmath0 , respectively , and not corrected for the branching ratios .",
