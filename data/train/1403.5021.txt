    "] thus the in - plane rkky range function for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides shows behavior that is intermediate between that of an ordinary 2d electron gas  @xcite ( or doped graphene  @xcite ) and undoped graphene  @xcite .    in the low - density regime , the amplitude of @xmath167 can be more than an order of magnitude larger than that of @xmath168 ; see fig .

    "it follows from this observation that the lowest - energy state of two rkky - coupled impurity spins can change from the typically expected easy - axis configuration ( both impurity spins align in the direction perpendicular to the monolayer plane ) to an easy - plane alignment if the distance @xmath3 corresponds to a point where @xmath168 [ @xmath167 ] has a maximum [ a zero ] .",
    "considering now a large number of impurity spins distributed , on average , homogeneously with density @xmath171 in the material , the rkky spin hamiltonian can be treated using standard mean - field theory  @xcite . for the hole - doped situation",
    ", we have @xmath172 , hence the spin system will exhibit ising - type ferromagnetism with curie temperature given by    @xmath173    with the temperature scale @xmath174    here @xmath175 and @xmath171 denote the impurity spin quantum number and areal density of impurities , respectively . due to the density dependence of @xmath176 [ see eq .",

    "[ fig : curietemp ] , the range of realistic values for the hole density allows for an adjustment of @xmath177 by only upto 10% in the high - density regime .    .",
    "[ fig : curietemp ] ]    in general , mean - field predictions for transition temperatures are only a crude approximation to reality , as the excitation of spin waves generally suppresses  in some cases , even destroys  magnetic order . for our case of interest",
    ", the line shape of @xmath131 near @xmath178 implies  @xcite that spin - wave excitations cost a finite amount of energy , hence the curie temperature should stay finite even when fluctuations are taken into account .",

    ", it mirrors some of the features of confined valence - band states in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a strong anisotropy of the spin susceptibility is exhibited , with the out - of - plane response being much stronger than the in - plane response in the low - density limit .",

    "we show that the oscillations of the in - plane spin response in real space decay faster than the typical @xmath4 law that is expected for a 2d fermi liquid .",
    "both the curie temperature for hole - mediated easy - axis ferromagnetism and the @xmath5 factor characterizing the zeeman spin splitting due to an in - plane magnetic field are found to be tunable by changing the hole density .    in this work ,",
    "we have neglected effects due to disorder and electron - electron interactions , which are known to , in principle , alter the spin response of ordinary 2d electron systems  @xcite .",
    "parameterization in terms of local field factors  @xcite could be used to shed further light on how interactions renormalize the spin susceptibility of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides . as far",
    "as disorder is concerned , it can be expected that important corrections to our results obtained in the clean limit will only arise for low - enough carrier densities when the difference between @xmath66 and the band edge is comparable in magnitude to the disorder - induced lifetime broadening  @xcite .",
    "the latter turns out to be of the order of @xmath60.01@xmath7ev in typical samples  @xcite and , therefore , is at least an order of magnitude smaller than all other relevant energy scales",
    ".    our work adds to the understanding of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides as a new materials system whose charge carriers show behavior that is sometimes reminiscent of  but generally distinct from  other 2d systems .",
    "the very different properties exhibited by the electron - doped and hole - doped cases create the possibility for a versatile engineering of electronic systems with specially tailored spin response .",
    "to verify our theoretical results , electronic - transport experiments could be used to measure the carrier spin susceptibility in the @xmath111 limit  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides would lend themselves as ideal samples for implementing a recent proposal  @xcite for determining the full spatial structure of the spin susceptibility .",
