    "measurement on sets with a specific geometric shape is of interest for many important applications , e.g. measurement along the isotherms . starting with the fundamental works of @xcite , the central importance of equidistant designs for the estimation of parameters of correlated processes has been realized .",
    "@xcite compared the efficiencies of equally spaced designs for one dimensional polynomial models for several design regions and correlation structures . in this context by a design we mean a set @xmath0 of locations where the investigated process is observed .",
    "a comparison in a multi - dimensional setup including correlations can be found in @xcite .",
    "later @xcite proved that equidistant design is optimal for estimating the unknown trend parameter of an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process .",
    "for other papers on exact designs we refer to the recent studies on stationary ou process with a constant mean by @xcite and @xcite . for prediction of ou process the optimality of the equidistant design",
    "was proved by @xcite .",
    "further , for a process with a parametrized mean , it is often possible to find an asymptotic design that performs well for a large number of design points , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "all above mentioned papers on optimal design for ou process considered design region to be an interval from real line .",
    "however , a one - dimensional interval is naturally a directed set induced by total ordering of real line .",
    "there is a big difference in geometry between plane and line and thus ou sheet sampled on a two dimensional interval provides much more delicate design strategies .    in the present work we derive the optimal exact designs for parameters of shifted ou sheet measured in the points constituting a _ monotonic set_. a monotonic set",
    "can be defined in arbitrary hilbert space @xmath1 with real or complex scalars .",
    "for @xmath2 we denote by @xmath3 the real part of the inner product .",
    "a set @xmath4 is called monotonic @xcite provided that for all @xmath5 we have @xmath6 .",
    "a practical example of such a set are measurements on isotherms of a stationary temperature field with several applications in thermal slab modelling ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "another important example in which monotonic measurements appear is motivated by measuring of methane adsorption @xcite where keeping all measurements at isotherm decreases the problems with stability .",
    "here we consider the following version of a monotonic set :    * condition d *  _ the potential design points @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes a compact design space , satisfy @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "_    we remark that the same observation scheme is used in @xcite where the authors deal with prediction of ou sheets and derive optimal designs with respect to integrated mean square prediction error and entropy criteria .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sec2 ] we introduce the model to be studied and our notations .",
    "section [ sec : sec3 ] deals with an example which motivates this study , namely a design experiment for measuring on isotherms of a stationary thermal field , while sections [ sec : sec4 ] , [ sec : sec5 ] , and [ sec : sec6 ] deal with the optimal designs for the estimation of parameters in our model .",
    "we demonstrate the substantial differences between the cases when only trend parameters are of interests and when the whole parameter set is of interest .",
    "finally , section [ sec : sec7 ] contains some applications and we summarize our results in section [ sec : sec8 ] . to maintain the continuity of the explanation , the proofs are included in the appendix",
    "consider the stationary process @xmath11 with design points taken from a compact design space @xmath12\\times [ a_2 , b_2]$ ] , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 , is a stationary ornstein - uhlenbeck sheet , that is a zero mean gaussian process with covariance structure @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "we remark that @xmath18 can also be represented as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , is a standard brownian sheet @xcite .",
    "covariance structure implies that for @xmath21 , the variogram @xmath22 equals @xmath23 and the correlation between two measurements depends on the distance through the semivariogram @xmath24 .    in order to apply the usual approach for design in spatial modeling @xcite",
    "we introduce @xmath25 and instead of we investigate @xmath26 where @xmath27 is considered as a known parameter .",
    "this form of the covariance structure is more suitable for statistical applications , while fits better to probabilistic modelling .",
    "further , we require _ condition d _ to be hold on the design points . under _ condition d",
    "_ we may use the construction of @xcite to obtain the inverse of the covariance matrix of observations which is tridiagonal .",
    "moreover , in case of an equidistant design the covariance matrix is toeplitz .",
    "an exact design allows the experimenter to plan where to measure the process to optimize a certain measure of variance of estimators , for optimal design in spatial case see @xcite . in the literature one can find applications of various criteria of design optimality for second - order models .",
    "here we consider d - optimality , which corresponds to the maximization of objective function @xmath28 , the determinant of the standard fisher information matrix .",
    "this method , `` plugged '' from the widely developed uncorrelated setup , is offering considerable potential for automatic implementation , although further development is needed before it can be applied routinely in practice .",
    "theoretical justifications for using fisher information for d - optimal designing under correlation can be found in @xcite and @xcite . @xcite",
    "considered a design space @xmath29 $ ] with the covariance structure @xmath30 and showed that @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the ( 1,1 ) entry of the inverse of the information matrix .",
    "@xcite used simulations ( under gaussian random field and matrn covariance structure ) to study whether the inverse fisher information matrix is a reasonable approximation of the covariance matrix of maximal likelihood ( ml ) estimators and a reasonable design criterion as well . for more references on the fisher information as design criterion in the correlated setup see e.g. @xcite where the structures of fisher information matrices for stationary processes were studied .",
    "@xcite showed that under mild conditions given on covariance structures the lower bound for the fisher information is an increasing function of the distances between the design points .",
    "particularly , this supports the idea of increasing domain asymptotics .",
    "if for a one - dimensional ou process only the trend parameters are of interest , then the designs covering uniformly the whole design space are very efficient .",
    "a similar observation is made in @xcite in a more general framework where the authors prove that if @xmath34 , then any exact @xmath35-point d - optimal design in the linear regression model with exponential semivariogram converges to the equally spaced design on the one dimensional design interval .",
    "a recurring topic in the recent literature is that uniform or equispaced designs perform well in terms of model - robustness when a bayesian approach is adopted , when the maximum bias is to be minimized or when the minimum power of the lack - of - fit test is to be maximized @xcite .",
    "however , an equidistant design is easy to construct in the case of a single experimental variable .",
    "when more than one variable is involved in an experiment and the number of observations available is small , it becomes much more difficult to construct these type of designs .",
    "uniform design is a kind of space - filling design whose applications in industrial experiments , reliability testing and computer experiments is a novel endeavor .",
    "the concept of uniform designs was introduced by @xcite and has now gained popularity and proved to be very successful in industrial applications ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 13 ) and in computer experiments @xcite .    however , for an ou sheet the optimality of a monotonic set is a very interesting property .",
    "it has become standard practice to select the design points such as to cover the available space as uniformly as possible , e.g. to apply the so called space - filling designs . in higher dimensions",
    "there are several ways to produce such designs .",
    "the importance of the discussion whether space - filling designs are superior has been addressed in the literature recently , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "therein the review of the circumstances under which this superiority holds is given together with the clarification of the motives to go beyond space - filling . in this paper",
    "we illustrate that for the ou sheet the design satisfying monotonicity _ condition d _ could be superior to the space filling grid design .    to 9 truecm ( a ) ( b )    the idea of choosing a monotonic set is in particular motivated by markovian properties of the ou sheet .",
    "we are not claiming that monotonic set designs should be used rigidly in engineering practice , but the aim of our paper is to show that for ou sheet in some scenarios a monotonic curve could provide better efficiency than the traditional grid designs .",
    "therefore , the experimenter is advised to integrate monotonic set design into his candidate designs portfolio - especially in the cases when there is a strong intuition / justification of markovianity of the process .",
    "being more particular , it is often overseen in practice , that information increases with the number of point only in the case of independence ( or specific form of dependence ) .",
    "thus general filling designs , generated without further caution , may increase variance instead of information @xcite .",
    "further discussion on designing for correlated processes in the context of space filling and its limitations can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "many recent developments on optimal design strategies for estimation of parameters should admit that they are mostly a _ benchmarks _ in the more realistic setups for optimal design ( like geometric progression ones discussed in in @xcite for one - dimensional design space , or designs for more complicated trends , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these _ benchmarks _ should always be directly confronted with a subject science , e.g. with methane modelling in the case of modified arrhenius model as in @xcite . in the current paper",
    "we provide a monotonic design as a benchmark design for a markovian stochastic process measured on rectangle ( with continuous time ) and a given subject science is taken from civil engineering where measurement of stationary thermal fields is an issue of interest @xcite .",
    "finally , we should emphasize that we have not tried to find optimal among general design setups ",
    "the main aim of the paper is to concentrate entirely on _ monotonic set designs_. however , we are working on finding the optimal regular grid designs for ou sheets where we are trying to make a comparison ( at least for small sample sizes ) with the globally optimal ones .",
    "temperature distribution calculation during the process of designing a building is a necessary part of testing the critical places at the building envelope .",
    "the aim is to increase the minimal surface temperature , and to predict the possible thermal bridges which are possible locations of mould growth in the building .",
    "figure [ fig1]a displays the composition of materials of the 2d section of a thermal bridge within the building construction , while on figure [ fig1]b a net for a finite element method is drawn where the points of temperature computation are given . in this way the system investigated is a computer experiment @xcite modelling the real temperature distribution in the building .",
    "data are taken from @xcite , where a finite element method for computation of the temperature field is applied using software package ansys .",
    "figure [ fig2]a illustrates the isotherms of the thermal field which fit well to measurements in a monotonic set satisfying _ condition d_.    to 9 truecm ( a ) ( b )    data points in which we measure the temperature are plotted on figure [ fig2]b .",
    "we assume that the covariance parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 are given and we are interested in the estimation of the trend parameter @xmath38 of model .",
    "table [ tablemotivatingex ] lists relative efficiency , information @xmath39 gained in the data points and the optimal information gain ( @xmath40 ) of the data from figure [ fig2]b for three choices of known correlation parameters @xmath41 .",
    "obviously , the relative efficiency of the given data points varies with these parameters .",
    ".efficiency depending on correlation parameters .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as bridge infrastructures age throughout the world , more and more bridges are being classified as structurally deficient @xcite . unfortunately ,",
    "due to limited financial resources , bridge owners are not able to immediately repair or , if needed , replace all of the structurally deficient bridges in their inventory . as a result ,",
    "methods for accurately assessing a bridge s true load - carrying capacity are needed so that the limited resources can be spent wisely .",
    "therefore , an efficient statistical modeling is needed to overcome the financial limitations via an efficient design .",
    "@xcite proposed a new model for corrosion rate that incorporates a multiplicative noise term ensuring that the corrosion loss function @xmath42 is non - decreasing in time , that is @xmath43 , for @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 , where @xmath37 and @xmath47 are parameters independent of time and @xmath48 is an ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "optimal designs for such a process are derived in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "however , several other corrosion sources can be available yielding a corrosion loss @xmath49 field depending on two variables with an error term @xmath50 forming a planar ornstein - uhlenbeck sheet .",
    "the design strategies studied in this paper might be of interest for practitioners in estimating the parameters of such a spatial random field .",
    "we have constructed exact optimal designs for estimation of parameters of shifted ornstein - uhlenbeck sheets on monotonic sets .",
    "the central importance of equidistant designs is visible . since the designs strategies for planar ou sheet are much more difficult than for univariate ou process , the possibility of efficient designing on a monotonic set is very interesting .",
    "we illustrated a possible loss of efficiency of the regular grid design with respect to the optimal design satisfying monotonicity _",
    "condition d_. a motivation example of isotherm measurement is given , simulated examples on highway deterioration are also presented .    in an uncorrelated model the parameter",
    "@xmath51 influences neither the estimation of the mean value parameters , nor the optimal design . in the present paper",
    "we assume @xmath51 to be known but a valuable direction for the future research will be the investigation of models with unknown nuissance parameter @xmath51 .",

    "hence , @xmath79 after long but straightforward calculations one can get @xmath80 so implies @xmath81 which completes the proof .",
    "@xmath67      consider first the case when we are interested in the estimation of one of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 and other parameters are considered as nuisance . if @xmath36 is the parameter of interest then according to the fisher information on @xmath36 equals @xmath82 , where @xmath83 due to the separation of the different data points in the expression of @xmath84 it suffices to consider the properties of the function @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "obviously , @xmath87 so the critical points of @xmath85 are @xmath88 .",
