    "@xcite utilized tycho-2 astrometry and photometry @xcite , and known / suspected cluster locations , to automatically characterize open cluster populations and identify their membership .",
    "after our investigation of lodn  1 was underway , @xcite repeated their cluster search and characterization program based on the ppmxl astrometric catalog @xcite and released a new cluster database that revised lodn  1 s age down to only 200 myr , with a distance of 786 pc and @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "this work details our investigation of lodn  1 . we were specifically concerned with two claims",
    "first , lodn  1 is old _ and _ nearby @xcite , meaning there exists some grouping of stars in the lodn  1 field that are gravitationally bound together in an open cluster within 500 pc , and have an age @xmath4 gyr .",
    "we also tested the separate claim that lodn  1 , as defined by @xcite and consisting of 29 specific stars , actually constitutes a real cluster .",
    "first , we checked the brightest stars in the field for evidence of clustering in astrometric proper motion and photometric archival data (  [ s : blind ] ) .",
    "next , we pursued a targeted search of the cluster as defined by @xcite for youth and proximity from optical and nir photometry , and common space motion via ppmxl proper motions and radial velocities we measured with spectra obtained from southern african large telescope ( salt ) robert stobie spectrograph ( rss ; section [ s : survey ] ) .",
    "we concluded that the old nearby cluster lodn  1 is neither old , nor nearby , nor a cluster ( section [ s : nope ] ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "historically , observers identified star clusters by carefully scanning the skies for apparent overdensities , which were then cataloged and classified .",
    "lodn s note on his field 1 is reminiscent of john herschel s 1830 description of r147 as `` a very large straggling space full of loose stars '' @xcite .",
    "while dense environments like the pleiades and m67 are unmistakably clusters , sparser objects like r147 and lodn  1 typically must be kinematically disentangled from the galactic field star population .",
    "in fact , the visual identifications for both were challenged in the years following their initial discovery , with @xcite describing lodn  1 as a `` dubious , object considered doubtful by the dss images inspection , '' while r147 ( then known as ngc 6774 ) was noted as `` possibly not a true cluster '' by @xcite.25% of the stars",
    "brighter than @xmath5 in the r147 field are cluster members .",
    "most of the bright stars that signaled to john herschel and jaroslav ruprecht that the field contained an open cluster actually do constitute an asterism .",
    "fortunately , a real and remarkable cluster existed amongst that asterism . ]",
    "although it sits in the galactic plane ( @xmath6@xmath7 , @xmath8@xmath7 ) , _ if _ lodn  1 is real _ and _ located within 500 pc , its proximity should mitigate galactic contamination by making its brightest stars  the main - sequence turnoff , red giant branch ( rgb ) , and any blue straggler stars ",
    "stand out against the field stars . even at 500 pc ,",
    "all of these subpopulations should appear brighter than @xmath0 .",
    "r147 has a confirmed age and distance that is very similar to the properties webda provides for lodn  1 . with a similar range in magnitude and location in the galactic plane ( r147 : @xmath9@xmath7 , @xmath10@xmath7 )",
    ", r147 provides an excellent test case and demonstration of our ability to identify old nearby clusters hiding amongst a dense galactic field .",
    "we considered all stars within 30 arcmin of the centers of lodn  1 and r147 by querying the ppmxl catalog for objects within these regions with @xmath11 , and found 520 and 612 entries for the lodn  1 and r147 fields , respectively .",
    "we defined two empirical control samples for each field by selecting an annulus of equal area encompassing the primary field and by selecting a neighboring 30 arcmin field at fixed galactic latitude , and shifted 1@xmath7 and 15 degrees in longitude for lodn  1 and r147 , respectively .",
    "we also generated synthetic control samples using the besanon population synthesis model for the milky way @xcite .",
    "+   +     +   +    let us begin by examining the proper motion distributions for the cluster and neighboring control fields and the galactic model simulation samples , which we plot in the top panels of figures [ f : r147 ] and [ f : loden1 ] for r147 and lodn  1 .",
    "the typical astrometric error for the ppmxl proper motions in this magnitude range is 5 @xmath12 ; for individual candidates ( table [ t : mem ] ) , the errors range from 1 to 6 @xmath12 , except for lodn  1 20 where @xmath13 = 15.7 @xmath12 .",
    "the bottom panels of these figures show 2mass @xmath14 versus @xmath15 color  magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) for these samples .",
    "the typical photometric errors are under 0.03 mag ( the mean and standard deviation of @xmath16 for the nearest 936 stars to the lodn  1 field with @xmath17 are 0.024 @xmath18 0.003 mag ) .    the proper motion distribution in the r147 field ( figure .",
    "[ f : r147 ] , left ) shows kinematic clumping clearly distinct from the field , which is emphasized by visual comparison to the control sample ( center ) and simulation sample ( right ) .",
    "the lodn  1 field and control samples visually appear quite similar and show no obvious clumping beyond the field distribution .",
    "identification of the r147 membership in the cmd is greatly facilitated by selecting stars within this kinematic clump , but this is not strictly necessary . at only 300 pc",
    "the r147 upper main sequence and rgb stand out from the galactic field in the cmd .",
    "we see no obvious overabundance along the lodn  1 stellar locus defined by the @xcite model , nor even at 500 pc .      if we assume that the control sample accurately represents the field star distribution of the target sample in terms of kinematics , stellar composition , and richness , then a statistical subtraction of the control sample from the target field might reveal hidden structure in the proper motion and cmds .",
    "we perform a simple subtraction by identifying the `` nearest neighbor '' of a particular star in the control field relative to the target sample , and removing it from the target list if this neighbor is within some threshold distance ( 0.05 mag for cmd subtraction , 5 @xmath12  for proper motion subtraction ) ; this test and subtraction is carried out on every object in the control sample .",
    "if an overdensity was masked by the field distribution , this subtraction might reveal it if the underlying cluster is rich enough to survive the subtraction .",
    "we found this simple technique encouraging when applied to the r147 field .",
    "filtering the cmd this way successfully removed much of the galactic background , and returned a much cleaner and better - defined main sequence ( figure .",
    "[ f : rfilter ] , top left ) .",
    "the remaining stars more prominently show the cluster clump in the proper motion diagram ( pmd , top right ) : originally 72 out of 600 stars fell within 5 @xmath12of the cluster s motion ; after cmd - filtering , the ratio is up to 55 out of 146 . filtering",
    "the proper motion diagram ( referred to as @xmath19-filtering in the figures ) left a few residual groupings where the control sample did not perfectly subtract out the galactic field ( bottom left ) , but r147 remains the dominant structure in the pmd .",
    "the cmd for this @xmath19-filtered sample shows a cleaner r147 sequence ( bottom right ) , and those within the r147 kinematic clump ( circled red ) are highlighted red in the cmd .",
    "let us now apply the same filtering technique to the lodn  1 field sample , using the annulus region as the control sample .",
    "figure [ f : lfilter ] shows that the photometric filtering subtracted out most of the stars in the field , leaving only a handful of stars brighter than @xmath0 .",
    "no cluster within at least 500 pc has been revealed by this technique , and the motions of these stars trace the proper motion distribution of the field overall .    filtering the lodn  1 field based on the proper motion distributions",
    "leaves very few remaining stars , likely meaning the control sample accurately represents the target sample .",
    "we can examine these residuals more closely by selecting all stars in the target sample with proper motions within 5 @xmath12  of the largest residual clump at @xmath20 @xmath12 .",
    "this is similar to , but not quite the cluster motion detected by @xcite at @xmath21 @xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , nine stars brighter than @xmath0 do congregate along an apparently coeval sequence at 510 pc .",
    "assuming [ fe / h ] = + 0.1 ( the metallicity of r147 ) , and assuming @xmath22 from a basic @xmath23 mag kpc@xmath24 extinction law @xcite , these nine stars can be fit with a 1.3 gyr dartmouth isochrone .",
    "their 2mass identities , @xmath25 photometry , and ppmxl proper motions are provided in table [ t : mem - jc ] , along with an additional seven fainter stars that blend into the galactic background at @xmath26 , and two stars that are 0.040.08 mag blueward in @xmath15 color of the putative main - sequence turnoff , which could be blue straggler candidates . while it might be tempting to interpret their kinematic and photometric association as evidence for an association or cluster remnant , we remind the reader that nine stars ( or even twenty ) spread over a 4 pc radius ( assuming 500 pc and a 30 arcmin radius ) can not remain gravitationally bound for long . , and a half - mass radius of 2 pc , the virial theorem predicts a velocity dispersion of 65 @xmath27 . ] even so , at 510 pc and 12 gyr , the association would only barely meet our conditions for lodn  1 being old , nearby , _ and useful _ as a benchmark system .",
    "+   +     +   +    thus , a proper motion and photometric check of the brightest stars in the field revealed no compelling evidence for a real cluster within 500 pc .",
    "next , we attempt to validate the cluster s existence as defined by @xcite .",
