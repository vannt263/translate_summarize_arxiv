    "in @xcite , @xcite , we proposed a mirror construction as follows .",

    ". roughly , these are degenerations for which the central fibre is a union of toric varieties glued along toric strata , and such that the map @xmath3 is locally given by a monomial near the zero - dimensional strata of the central fibre @xmath4 .",
    "associated to this degeneration we construct the _ dual intersection complex _",
    "@xmath5 , where    ( a )  @xmath6 is an @xmath1-dimensional integral affine manifold with singularities ( possibly with boundary ) . in other words",
    ", @xmath6 is a topological manifold with an open subset @xmath7 with @xmath8 of codimension @xmath9 , such that @xmath7 has an atlas of coordinate charts whose transition maps lie in @xmath10 , the group of integral affine transformations .",
    "( b )  @xmath11 is a decomposition of @xmath6 into convex lattice polyhedra ( possibly unbounded ) .",
    "the singular locus @xmath12 is typically the union of codimension two cells of the first barycentric subdivision of @xmath11 not intersecting the interior of a maximal cell of @xmath11 nor containing a vertex of @xmath11 .",
    "there is a one - to - one inclusion reversing correspondence between elements of @xmath11 and toric strata of @xmath4 .",
    "the local structure of @xmath11 near a vertex is determined by the fan defining the corresponding irreducible component .",
    "the maximal cells of @xmath11 are determined by the toric structure of the map @xmath3 near the corresponding zero - dimensional strata of @xmath4 .",
    "( c )  @xmath13 is a _ multi - valued piecewise affine function_. this is a collection @xmath14 of @xmath15-valued functions @xmath16 on an open cover @xmath17 of @xmath6 , with each @xmath16 piecewise affine linear with respect to the polyhedral decomposition @xmath11 , and @xmath18 being affine linear on @xmath19 .",
    "we assume the slopes of the @xmath16 on cells of @xmath11 to be integral . in this case , @xmath13 is determined by the polarization on @xmath20 , with local representatives near vertices given by a piecewise linear function defined by restricting the polarization to the corresponding irreducible component .    given this data ,",
    "we obtain the mirror to the degeneration @xmath21 by reinterpreting @xmath5 as the _ intersection complex _ of another polarized toric degeneration @xmath22 ( in the projective case ) .",
    "this time , there is a one - to - one inclusion preserving correspondence between cells of @xmath11 and toric strata of @xmath4 , the central fibre of this new degeneration .",
    "the cells of @xmath11 are the newton polytopes for the polarization restricted to the various strata of @xmath4 , and @xmath13 is determined by the local toric structure of the map near zero - dimensional strata .",
    "the prime difficulty in the program lies in reconstructing @xmath23 from the data @xmath5 .",
    "the main result of @xcite gives an algorithm for constructing a _ structure _ @xmath24 of walls which tell us how to construct the degeneration .",

    "fukaya gave a heuristic suggesting that one should be able to construct the mirror to a k3 surface using objects that look like structures in two dimensions ( in two dimensions , we can think of a structure as just consisting of a possibly infinite number of unbounded rays ) .",
    "fukaya observed that holomorphic disks with boundary on fibres of an syz fibration ( @xcite ) gave similar pictures of structures on the mirror side . in 2004 ,",
    "kontsevich and soibelman in @xcite gave the first construction of a structure , showing how given a two - dimensional affine sphere with singularities one could construct a consistent structure and from this structure a non - archimedean k3 surface .",
    "we combined the picture of toric degenerations we had been developing independently of the above - mentioned authors with some ideas from @xcite , allowing us to construct degenerations from structures in all dimensions in @xcite .    in the first two sections of this paper",
    ", we shall illustrate the program by carrying it out completely for toric calabi - yau manifolds , a case usually referred to as local mirror symmetry @xcite . this particular case can be viewed as being complementary to the case that the ideas of @xcite was able to handle . in the remaining sections , we shall analyze enumerative meaning and a tropical interpretation of this construction .",

    "our running example is the construction of the mirror of what is called `` local @xmath33 '' , the total space @xmath34 of the canonical bundle @xmath35 over @xmath33 . since @xmath34 itself is a toric variety , its anti - canonical divisor @xmath36 is linearly equivalent to the sum of toric divisors .",
    "there are four toric divisors , the zero section @xmath37 , which is the maximal compact subvariety of @xmath34 , and the preimages @xmath38 of the three coordinate lines in @xmath33 under the bundle projection @xmath39 .",
    "toric methods show that @xmath40 and hence @xmath34 is a non - compact calabi - yau threefold . the normal bundle @xmath41 is determined by the adjunction formula from the calabi - yau condition and it is the dual of an ample line bundle .",
    "hence , by a result of grauert @xcite , any embedded @xmath33 in a calabi - yau threefold has an analytic neighbourhood biholomorphic to an analytic neighbourhood of @xmath42 in @xmath34 .    for the general description , fix throughout @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "will eventually be treated as data for the mirror side our conventions in this section are opposite to the usual ones in toric geometry . ]",
    "let @xmath46 be a compact lattice polytope , and assume @xmath47 .",
    "define @xmath48 the cone @xmath49 viewed as a fan defines an affine toric variety @xmath50 .",
    "a polyhedral decomposition @xmath51 of @xmath52 into standard simplices leads to a fan @xmath53 which is a refinement of @xmath49 .",
    "this yields a toric resolution of singularities @xmath54 .",
    "assume also that the fan @xmath55 supports at least one strictly convex piecewise linear function .",
    "for the case of local @xmath33 take @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the convex hull of the set @xmath42 .",

    "one can show that @xmath68 is the total space of @xmath35 and the map to @xmath69 is the contraction of the zero section .",
    "note also that the projection @xmath70 defines a map from @xmath55 to the fan of @xmath33 , which indeed corresponds to the bundle projection @xmath71 .",
    "in general , the map @xmath72 has a reducible exceptional locus , with one component for each vertex of @xmath73 that is not a vertex of @xmath52 , and the explicit description of the geometry is more complicated .",
    "it turns out that constructing a mirror to @xmath74 does not fit well with our program .",
    "the reason is that @xmath68 does not seem to possess a fibration by lagrangian tori of the kind expected by mirror symmetry @xcite .",
    "rather , such a fibration will exist only after removal of a hypersurface in @xmath74 that is disjoint from the exceptional fibre of @xmath72 . to run our program",
    "we could give an ad hoc construction of an affine manifold with singularities derived from the fan @xmath55 or write down a toric degeneration of @xmath68 .",
    "the local @xmath33 case has been discussed from the former point of view in @xcite , examples  5.1 and 5.2 .",
    "since it can be done easily in the present case we follow the latter method here .",
    "this method is motivated by the construction of toric degenerations of hypersurfaces in toric varieties in @xcite .    to exhibit @xmath68 as an anticanonical hypersurface in a toric variety we embed the fan @xmath55 in @xmath75 as a subfan of a fan @xmath76 in @xmath77 .",
    "for each maximal cone @xmath78 the fan @xmath76 has two maximal cones + @xmath79 then @xmath55 is the subfan of @xmath76 consisting of cones lying in the hyperplane @xmath80 .",
    "the fan @xmath76 only has two rays not contained in @xmath55 , with generators @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the inclusion @xmath83 induces a map of fans from @xmath55 to @xmath76 , hence an embedding @xmath84 identifying @xmath74 with the closure of the orbit of the subtorus defined by this inclusion through the distinguished point ( the unit of the toric variety ) .",
    "note that the projection to @xmath85 maps @xmath76 to the fan @xmath86 of the toric blowing up @xmath87 of @xmath88 , with rays generated by @xmath89 . under this map the subfan @xmath90 maps to the interior ray @xmath91 . viewing this interior ray as giving a map of fans , from the one - dimensional fan defining @xmath92 to the two - dimensional fan defining @xmath87",
    ", we obtain an embedding @xmath93 .",
    "we thus obtain a cartesian diagram of toric morphisms @xmath94\\ ] ] the left vertical arrow is induced by the projection @xmath95 , hence is given by the pull - back to @xmath68 of the distinguished monomial @xmath96 on @xmath69 defining the toric boundary as a reduced subscheme .",
    "explicitly , write @xmath97 for the toric coordinates on @xmath88 and @xmath98 for the blowing up",
    ". then @xmath99 is the strict transform of the diagonal @xmath100 .",
    "dehomogenizing @xmath101 or @xmath102 we obtain the usual two coordinate patches with coordinates @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively with the transitions @xmath105 and @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "we use the same notation for the pull - back of @xmath108 to the corresponding two types of affine patches with @xmath109 or @xmath110 of @xmath111 .    to describe @xmath111",
    "let @xmath78 be a maximal cone .",
    "then if @xmath112 defines a facet @xmath113 , that is , @xmath114 generates an extremal ray of @xmath115 , the element @xmath116 defines the facet @xmath117 of @xmath118 .",
    "there is only one more facet of @xmath118 , namely @xmath119 itself , defined by @xmath120 , and hence @xmath121 the rays of @xmath122 are generated by @xmath123 for @xmath114 an extremal ray of @xmath115 , and by @xmath81 , so @xmath124 . in either case , we have an identification @xmath125= { \\operatorname{spec}}{\\bbbk}[c^\\vee\\cap n]\\times{\\mathbb{a}}^1 \\subset x_\\sigma\\times{\\mathbb{a}}^1.\\ ] ] the toric coordinate for @xmath92 is @xmath126 for @xmath118 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 . from this description",
    "it is clear that the embedding of @xmath68 in @xmath111 is given by @xmath101 in affine patches with @xmath110 and by @xmath102 in the affine patches with @xmath109 .    to write down a degeneration of @xmath68 to the toric boundary @xmath129 view @xmath130 as sections of the line bundle @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the exceptional curve .",
    "then @xmath68 is the zero locus of @xmath133 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath134 defines a section @xmath135 of @xmath131 with zero locus @xmath136 .",
    "thus the hypersurface @xmath137 with equation @xmath138 defines a pencil in @xmath111 with members @xmath68 at @xmath139 and with the toric boundary @xmath136 at @xmath140 .",
    "note this pencil is the preimage of the pencil on @xmath141 defined by the same equations .",
    "in particular , by direct computation @xmath142 is completely contained in either type of coordinate patch for @xmath143 .",
    "working in a patch with @xmath144 we have @xmath145 , @xmath146 and the equation @xmath147 shows @xmath148 .",
    "thus @xmath149 and @xmath150 can be eliminated . in other words , @xmath151 with @xmath152 the hypersurface @xmath153 .",
    "note also that our notation is consistent in that @xmath96 indeed descends to the defining equation of the toric boundary of @xmath69 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath154 is a toric degeneration .",
    "indeed , we have already checked that @xmath155 is the toric boundary of @xmath156 .",
    "some harder work shows that locally near the zero - dimensional strata of @xmath4 , the projection @xmath157 is toric .",
    "we omit the details , but this can be done similarly to arguments given in @xcite .    the dual intersection complex",
    "is then easily described along the lines given in @xcite , where , for a calabi - yau hypersurface in a toric variety , @xmath6 was described as the boundary of a reflexive polytope , with the cones over the faces of the polytope yielding the fan defining the ambient toric variety .",
    "topologically , we can write @xmath158 as @xmath159 where @xmath160 note that the support of the fan @xmath76 above is the cone over @xmath161 . we then take @xmath162 .    finally , the affine structure on @xmath6 is defined as follows .",
    "identify @xmath52 with @xmath163 , and take the discriminant locus @xmath12 to be the union of cells of the first barycentric subdivision of @xmath51 not containing vertices of @xmath51 , see figure  [ p2localfigure ] .",
    "we then define affine charts as follows .",
    "first , we define affine charts @xmath164 as the inclusions , where @xmath165 denotes the affine hyperplane in @xmath166 spanned by @xmath167 .",
    "second , for each vertex @xmath168 , choose a neighbourhood @xmath169 of @xmath170 .",
    "these neighbourhoods can be chosen so that @xmath171 if @xmath172 and the two sets @xmath173 along with the open sets @xmath169 cover @xmath174 .",
    "define a chart @xmath175 via the inclusion followed by the projection .",
    "it is easy to check that these charts give an integral affine structure .",
    "this again precisely follows the procedure for calabi - yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties considered in @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to the pair @xmath176 .",
    "in general , a pair @xmath176 can be described by specifying the lattice polytopes in @xmath11 and specifying a _ fan structure _ at each vertex @xmath177 , that is , the identification of a neighbourhood of each vertex with the neighbourhood of @xmath178 in a fan @xmath179 .",
    "this identification gives a one - to - one inclusion preserving correspondence between cells of @xmath11 containing @xmath177 and cones of @xmath179 , along with integral affine identifications of the tangent wedges of each cell @xmath180 containing @xmath177 with the corresponding cone of @xmath179 .",
    "these identifications patch together to give an affine chart in a neighbourhood of the vertex @xmath177 .    in our example",
    ", it is worth describing the fan structure at a vertex @xmath181 .",
    "since the fan structure at a vertex must be the fan yielding the corresponding irreducible component of @xmath155 , toric geometry tells us this fan structure must be given as the quotient fan obtained from @xmath76 by dividing out by the ray generated by this vertex .",
    "explicitly , we use the chart @xmath182 the latter isomorphism given by @xmath183 .",
    "the fan @xmath179 can then be described as the fan of tangent wedges to images of cells @xmath180 containing @xmath177 .",
    "the set of maximal cones of this fan , described as subsets of @xmath184 , is @xmath185 where @xmath186 denotes the tangent wedge to @xmath187 in @xmath188 .",
    "figure [ locala1example ] shows some of the fan structures when @xmath52 is an interval @xmath189 $ ] of length two .",
    "one can understand the nature of the singularities of @xmath6 by studying the local system @xmath190 of integral vector fields on @xmath7 .",
    "given integral affine coordinates @xmath191 , @xmath190 is locally the family of lattices in the tangent bundle of @xmath7 generated by @xmath192 .",
    "if @xmath193 are adjacent vertices , consider a path @xmath194 passing from @xmath177 through @xmath195 to @xmath196 and then through @xmath197 back to @xmath177 . to identify @xmath198 , we can use the chart , which gives an identification of @xmath198 with @xmath199 .",
    "it is an easy exercise to check that parallel transport in @xmath190 around @xmath194 yields a _ monodromy transformation _ @xmath200",
    "the final piece of data for the dual intersection complex @xmath5 of @xmath154 is a multi - valued piecewise linear function @xmath13 describing aspects of the khler geometry of the situation .    in the next section",
    ", we will build the mirror family over some base scheme .",
    "the natural choice for this base is related to the khler cone of @xmath68 , or the picard group . by toric geometry",
    ", @xmath201 equals piecewise linear functions on @xmath55 modulo linear functions .",
    "it will thus be convenient to normalize the piecewise linear functions as follows .",
    "choose a maximal cell @xmath202 which has @xmath178 as a vertex .",
    "let @xmath26 be the monoid of integral convex piecewise linear functions on the fan @xmath55 which take the value @xmath178 on the cone @xmath203 .",
    "note that @xmath204 .",
    "setting @xmath205 , there is a universal piecewise linear function @xmath206 , with @xmath207 this function is strictly convex in the sense of @xcite , definition 1.12 . in the local @xmath33 case",
    "normalized piecewise linear functions are determined by the value at the one remaining vertex of @xmath52 not contained in @xmath208 and hence @xmath209 .",
    "the multi - valued piecewise linear function @xmath13 comes from the universal piecewise linear function @xmath210 on @xmath211 by descent to a quotient fan , or rather from a choice of extension of this function to @xmath212 .",
    "this choice can be made by choosing an element @xmath213 .",
    "while the choice of @xmath214 affects the family of polarizations on @xmath111 , it does not affect the family after restriction to @xmath142 for @xmath215 .",
    "however , it does affect the polarization on @xmath20 , and hence will play some role in the mirror , seen explicitly in .",
    "we take @xmath216 to be the @xmath217-valued piecewise linear extension of @xmath210 which takes the value @xmath178 at @xmath82 and the value @xmath214 at @xmath81 .",
    "one can check that this function is strictly convex in the sense of @xcite , definition 1.12 .",
    "we can then construct @xmath13 from @xmath218 as follows . for each @xmath219",
    ", let @xmath220 be the corresponding cell of @xmath11 .",
    "the function @xmath218 induces a function on the quotient fan of @xmath221 along @xmath119 ( this quotient fan determining the fan structure of @xmath6 along @xmath208 ) as follows .",

    "having described @xmath5 in our example as the dual intersection complex of a degeneration of the local calabi - yau @xmath68 , we turn to the construction of the mirror , which shall be a family @xmath32}$ ] over a generally higher - dimensional base .",

    "as the case at hand will be projective , the grothendieck existence theorem gives rise to the desired family .",
    "alternatively , @xmath25 can be constructed using a graded ring of theta functions , following @xcite .",
    "here is a brief summary of the construction .",

    "the interpretation supports the view that the degenerations constructed by structures are indeed the ones expected from homological mirror symmetry and open - closed string theory .    since the completion of @xcite , a clearer idea emerged as to the precise meaning of structures .",
    "this picture has arisen from several converging points of view : ( 1 ) the heuristic correspondence between tropical morse trees and floer homology emerging in discussions between us and mohammed abouzaid .",
    "some of these ideas were discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) auroux s work @xcite on @xmath427-duality on complements of anti - canonical divisors , describing the complex structure on the syz dual of a lagrangian fibration using counts of maslov index two disks .",
    "this has inspired quite a bit of work , which is realising fukaya s original dream of correcting the complex structure of the mirror via counts of holomorphic disks .",
    "( 3 ) @xcite made explicit the enumerative content of the key part of the algorithm of @xcite ( or the two - dimensional version of @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , this established an enumerative meaning for functions attached to walls of a structure .",

    "consider maslov index zero holomorphic disks with boundary a fibre of @xmath429 .",
    "for dimensional reasons the expectation is that the set of points in @xmath430 such that @xmath431 bounds a maslov index zero holomorphic disk is real codimension one in @xmath6 , forming a collection of walls .",
    "these walls should determine the structure necessary to build the mirror to @xmath34 , but one needs to attach functions to the walls .",
    "again , heuristically , these functions are expected to take the shape , at a point @xmath430 with @xmath432 , @xmath433 here the sum is over all relative homotopy classes @xmath434 such that @xmath435 is non - zero , @xmath436 is the index of @xmath437 and @xmath438 is some count of maslov index zero disks with boundary on @xmath439 .",
    "this series should be defined as a formal power series in some suitable ring .",
    "one can note that as @xmath430 varies , the groups @xmath440 vary forming a local system on @xmath7 ( where @xmath441 ) .",

    "it is difficult to give exact definitions for the numbers @xmath438 .",
    "there have been several approaches to dealing with this .",
    "for example , auroux @xcite pioneered , in the case of an effective anti - canonical divisor , the use of counts of maslov index two disks to define holomorphic coordinates which are then transformed by wall - crossing automorphisms as we cross walls in @xmath6 over which maslov index zero disks live .",
    "a different approach , using log geometry , originates in @xcite .",
    "there , working with pandharipande , we used relative gromov - witten invariants to make sense of the formula .",
    "the situation there was effectively that of a rational surface with an anti - canonical divisor @xmath443 , and the @xmath438 of are replaced with counts of curves meeting the divisor @xmath443 in one point .",
    "this was used for a general mirror symmetry construction for such surfaces in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note how these two points of view apply to the case of local mirror symmetry considered in this paper .",
    "auroux s point of view was used effectively in a sequence of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to study the same local mirror symmetry situation as discussed in this paper .",
    "wall - crossing formulas for counts of maslov index two disks are used to obtain what should be the same slab functions as discussed in this paper .",
    "the count of maslov index two disks is reduced to a closed gromov - witten invariant on a toric variety , which can then be calculated via known mirror symmetry results .",
    "this allows one to show show that the slab functions defined using their counts give rise to canonical coordinates just as our slab functions do .    on the other hand , generalising the idea of replacing holomorphic disks with relative curves",
    ", one should be able to work with a certain kind of logarithmic curve called a _ punctured curve _ , the theory of which is currently being developed in a joint project with abramovich and chen @xcite .",
    "these curves will live in the central fibre of the toric degeneration @xmath444 constructed in  2 , and can be viewed as a substitute for holomorphic curves with boundary in an algebro - geometric context .",
    "then can be used to define slab functions , where now @xmath438 is a count of genus @xmath178 logarithmic curves with one puncture .",
    "we do not propose calculating the slab functions in this way .",
    "rather , we should be able to show that the slab functions defined in this way satisfy the same determining properties that the slab functions of  2 did .",
    "this is done by probing slabs by broken lines ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and interpreting these enumeratively using a different type of punctured curve , roughly corresponding to cylinders .",
    "these punctured curves play the same role that maslov index two disks play in the analysis of slab functions of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "crucially , we need to use the gluing formula of @xcite to relate broken lines and punctured curves .",
    "while the details of this approach will be given elsewhere , let us demonstrate this using the simple example from examples [ slabfunctionexamples ] , ( 1 ) .",
    "we depict in figure [ a2exampleblowup ] the central fibre of the degeneration @xmath390 constructed in  2 in this case .",
    "the total space @xmath20 has two ordinary double points , situated on the singular locus of @xmath155 , where the map @xmath390 is not normal crossings .",
    "the inclusion @xmath445 induces a log structure on @xmath155 , but the log structure is not well - behaved at the two points ( not _ fine _ in the sense of log geometry ) .",
    "in particular , the theory of log gromov - witten invariants as developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite can not be used directly .",
    "while a theory of invariants which can deal directly with this poorly behaved log structure is under development , for the moment we will deal with it via a small resolution of the ordinary double points .",
    "there are four choices of such resolutions , one of which is shown on the right in figure [ a2exampleblowup ] .",
    "these choices can be thought of in terms of the affine geometry of the dual intersection complex @xmath6 , with the resolutions corresponding to sliding the two singularities of the affine structure along @xmath52 to various choices of vertices .",
    "we have different slab functions @xmath293 for the vertices @xmath446 .",
    "to identify the slab function at a vertex @xmath177 as a generating function , we choose a small resolution @xmath447 so that the irreducible component indexed by @xmath177 remains toric .",
    "this effectively slides the singularities away from the vertex .",
    "the resolution in figure [ a2exampleblowup ] is used for the vertex @xmath448 .",
    "the slab function is given by where @xmath438 is a count of log curves of genus @xmath178 with one puncture mapping to the boundary of the component @xmath449 indexed by @xmath177 . in figure",
    "[ a1curves ]",
    "we show the two obvious such curves for @xmath448 .",
    "however , multiple covers of these curves totally ramified at the puncture points are also possible , and a @xmath450-fold cover will contribute with multiplicity @xmath451 .",
    "the slab function is then , following , @xmath452 with the monomials @xmath453 and @xmath454 and their powers playing the role of @xmath455 .    to prove this formula without a direct calculation",
    ", we show the slab functions defined by these counts satisfy conditions 1 - 4 of  [ sect : mirror ] .",
    "conditions  1 and 3 are obvious from , as the statement that only monomials @xmath455 with @xmath456 appear is analogous to the statement that no terms of the form @xmath304 for @xmath457 appear inside the exponential .",
    "condition 4 is automatic because in this situation the slab function only depends on the vertex .",
    "it remains to show condition 2 , and we use broken lines for this , which can be reviewed in @xcite .",
    "a broken line is a piecewise linear path with monomials @xmath458 attached to each domain of linearity , and the derivative of the line in the domain @xmath439 is @xmath459 .",
    "when the broken line crosses a wall , we may change the monomial by applying the wall - crossing automorphism to the monomial and choosing a new monomial being one of the terms in the expression obtained after applying this automorphism . in figure [ brokenlines ]",
    ", we consider germs of broken lines which come vertically from below with initial monomial @xmath460 with @xmath461 .",
    "we define @xmath462 to be the sum over all broken lines ending at a basepoint @xmath260 of the final attached monomials .",
    "note that if @xmath260 is near a vertex @xmath177 of @xmath52 , then in fact @xmath463 .",
    "it is then not difficult to show that holds for all pairs of adjacent vertices if and only if @xmath462 is independent of @xmath260 chosen above the slabs as in figure [ brokenlines ] .",
    "broken lines can be viewed as a purely combinatorial ( tropical ) way to count holomorphic cylinders .",
    "but we can actually count logarithmic curves of genus @xmath178 with two punctures to emulate cylinders , and there will be a correspondence between such twice - punctured logarithmic curves and broken lines . varying the basepoint",
    "can be achieved by varying a point constraint for one of the punctures .",
    "the key point is that various ways of degenerating the point constraint can lead to different broken lines with different endpoints .",
    "however , the count of these punctured curves will be independent of the constraint .    to see this explicitly , let s look at the example of the straight line in the left - hand diagram in figure [ brokenlines ] with attached monomial @xmath460 .",
    "to understand what happens when we move this broken line through the singularity , it is helpful to move the singularity to the vertex @xmath178 by using the small resolution depicted in figure [ brokenlines2 ] . consider the family of twice - punctured curves given by the vertical fibres of @xmath4 , the blowup of @xmath464 .",
    "any curve in this family has a tropicalization ( see @xcite ,  3 ) .",
    "the tropicalization of a general curve in this family is just the vertical line through the singularity on the right - hand side of figure [ brokenlines2 ] .",
    "combinatorially , this just indicates that the curve intersects the upper and lower boundary divisors of @xmath4 .",
    "however , the family has two special members which are degenerate with respect to the log structure on the central fibre .",
    "the tropicalization of the punctured curve when it falls into @xmath465 is the straight broken line depicted in figure [ brokenlines2 ] to the right of the vertex .",
    "if on the other hand we move the punctured curve to the left , it becomes reducible , the union of @xmath466 and the exceptional curve of the small resolution .",
    "this curve tropicalizes to the tropical curve depicted on the left , now with two vertices corresponding to the two components .",
    "the bend is a consequence of gluing the once - punctured curve with support the exceptional curve to the thrice - punctured curve with support @xmath467 .",
    "the broken line is then a subset of this tropical curve .",
    "the point is that the two broken lines make the same contribution to @xmath462 as @xmath260 varies because they can both be viewed as counting the number of curves in the one - parameter family described passing through some point in @xmath4 .",
    "the point can degenerate into @xmath466 or @xmath465 , giving the two types of broken line behaviour .",
    "thus the invariance of @xmath462 can be viewed as the fact that these lifts are generating functions for counts of certain types of punctured curves .",
    "the key point for the argument is then to prove that broken lines really calculate gromov - witten invariants of punctured curves .",
    "this shall be shown using a general gluing formula @xcite .",
    "note so far we have not actually calculated the gromov - witten invariants of @xmath74 .",
    "these should be extracted in the @xmath6-model from some additional period integrals past the ones discussed in remark [ rem : periods ] .",

    "we require that there are no elements with only one predecessor . in graph theory language",
    "this means that the interior vertices are at least trivalent and the leaves are the unique univalent vertices .",
    "[ def : tropical disks ] the _ type of a @xmath26-labelled tropical disk _ is a rooted tree @xmath494 with sets @xmath495 of vertices and @xmath496 of edges along with a _ vertex - labeling _ map @xmath497 fulfilling the following conditions :    1 .   for any non - leaf vertex @xmath498 with predecessors @xmath499 the balancing condition",
    "@xmath500 holds .",
    "2 .   for any vertex @xmath177",
    "the weights @xmath501 of the adjacent predecessor vertices are pairwise distinct .",
    "if we take the weight @xmath503 of the root vertex in @xmath260 rather than in @xmath504 and otherwise leave the definition unchanged we arrive at the notion of _ type of @xmath26-labelled pointed rational tropical curve_.    each type of tropical disk or rational tropical curve determines an isotopy class of traditional tropical curves in @xmath489 with edges labelled by lifts of the direction vector ( an element of @xmath505 ) to @xmath26 , the labelling of the predecessor vertex . in the disk case",
    "one may add another edge to force the balancing condition at the root vertex .",
    "the balancing condition for a tropical disk implies that the labelling function is uniquely determined by its values on the leaf vertices @xmath499 .",
    "in particular , for the weight of the root vertex we have @xmath506    let now @xmath507 be the set of exponents @xmath490 occuring in @xmath429 with @xmath508 .",

    "expanding the infinite product in the statement and gathering according to monomials yields @xmath519 in this expansion @xmath520 is the number of @xmath488-terms in the infinite product to be multiplied .",
    "thus the third sum on the right - hand side is over all decompositions @xmath521 of @xmath490 into @xmath520 _ pairwise distinct _ summands in @xmath26 .",
    "recall that @xmath502 is the set of non - leaf vertices .",
    "fix @xmath490 with @xmath510 now and consider the coefficient of @xmath460 . then for @xmath522 any collection @xmath523 of types of tropical disks with @xmath524 can be merged into a new type of tropical disk @xmath525 by connecting the root vertex of each @xmath526 by one edge to the root vertex @xmath527 .",
    "thus the root vertex of @xmath494 is @xmath520-valent with adjacent predecessor trees @xmath528 .",
    "now this merged tree @xmath494 contributes to the coefficient of @xmath460 as one term for @xmath529 . since the vertices of @xmath494 other than the root vertex are in bijection with the vertices of @xmath528 it holds @xmath530 thus each term with @xmath522 in the sum of the right - hand side of cancels with one term for @xmath529 .",
    "conversely , if the root vertex of the type of a tropical disk @xmath494 has valency @xmath522 then @xmath494 is obtained by this merging procedure . on the right - hand side of we",
    "are thus left only with those @xmath490 with @xmath531 and in addition with those trees with only one vertex .",
    "the latter condition means that the root vertex is also a leaf vertex .",

    "since the left - hand side of this equation is clearly normalized we see that @xmath536 .",
    "tropically , the coefficient of @xmath304 in @xmath492 is the weighted sum of types of @xmath26-labelled pointed rational tropical curves , with the marked point ( of valency @xmath522 ) the merging point of @xmath520 tropical trees @xmath528",
    ". the balancing condition of an underlying tropical curve at the marked point is the statement @xmath537    for @xmath538 the expansion up to order @xmath539 is @xmath540 figure  [ trees ] shows the tropical trees contributing to the coefficient @xmath541 of @xmath542 .",
    "note that many labelled trees with four leaves are ruled out because of the third condition in definition  [ def : tropical disks ] that no two predecessor subtrees at some vertex be isomorphic .",
