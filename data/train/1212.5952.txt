    "recent large surveys such as sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the 2-micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) have delivered an enormous amount of data about the stellar populations of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "these studies have probed a new regime in parameter space of milky way satellites , by significantly expanding the volume over which the faintest systems can be detected , and have revealed a wealth of new objects .",
    "one striking discovery from these surveys is the myriad of substructures that populate the mw structural components , including stellar streams from disrupting satellite galaxies and tidal tails from globular clusters ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has included the exciting discovery of a new class of faint dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may elucidate our understanding of small - scale structure in the dark matter distribution and of galaxy formation at the lowest masses .",
    "in addition , a handful of very faint stellar systems have been identified in the outer halo @xcite , with somewhat different properties from more massive clusters .",
    "studies of extragalactic star cluster systems have also revealed the existence of diffuse and low surface brightness stellar systems around luminous galaxies , such as faint fuzzies ( ff ) and diffuse star clusters ( dsc ) @xcite .",
    "studying nearby counterparts of these elusive objects will allow us to better constrain their structure , dynamics , and formation histories .",
    "a significant population of mw satellites is very likely still left undiscovered @xcite .",
    "future deep surveys , such as the dark energy survey and the large synoptic survey telescope , will allow very faint systems to be probed much further out in the galactic halo , and are likely to provide important new clues to the formation mechanism of globular clusters , to the hierarchical buildup of the milky way system , to galaxy formation physics in low masses systems , and to the abundance and properties of the smallest scale structures in the universe @xcite .    in this work we present the discovery of a new stellar system in the mw halo .",
    "the object is located at @xmath12 , or @xmath13 , in the pegasus constellation .",
    "its standard sdss object name is sdss j2211 + 1457 , although in this work we choose to call it by a shorter name , /.",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the data and methods that led to this discovery . in section 3",
    "the follow - up observations and data reduction are briefly explained . in section 4",
    "we quantify the properties of the object in section 5 and discuss the nature of / in comparison to other satellite systems discovered in the mw .",
    "this object is likely a very old stellar cluster , one of the lowest mass and lowest surface brightness objects yet detected .",
    "the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) is one of the four surveys that belong to the sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii ) .",
    "its imaging stage is now complete with photometry in the @xmath14 system for @xmath15 sources covering a region of @xmath16 deg@xmath9 in the southern galactic hemisphere was released in january 2011 as part of the sdss data release 8 ( dr8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far , no systematic search for mw faint satellites has been published in the boss footprint .",
    "our discovery data were taken from the dr8 ` photoprimary ` view table .",
    "a _ clean _ sample was defined by selecting those objects flagged as reliable stars or galaxies ( see detection process below ) .    to search for stellar systems in a large area of the sky",
    ", we developed an automated tool called /.",
    "the algorithm closely follows the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are three main steps in the algorithm .",
    "first a color - magnitude cut based on stellar evolutionary models is applied to enhance the presence of old metal - poor stellar populations relative to field stars .",
    "next , / uses this filtered stellar sample and creates a density map on the sky plane .",
    "finally , the density map is convolved with a kernel that is the difference between two gaussians , one with the angular size of a typical milky way ( mw ) satellite ( @xmath17 ) , and the other much wider , used to smooth out any remaining large scale structure on the map .",
    "source detection is performed on the convolved map using ` sextractor ` @xcite . to circumvent misidentification due to poor star - galaxy separation",
    ", we apply identical steps to build density maps of sources classified as galaxies by the sdss reduction pipeline and apply sextractor to them . for a given detected source ,",
    "/ then compares the signals in the smoothed stellar and galaxy density images as determined by sextractor , ( / and / , respectively ) .",
    "known faint satellites tend to fall in the low / and high / locus of / vs. / plane .",
    "we use this region to select our new satellite candidates .",
    "we also compare the position of these new overdensities with those of known objects found in abell , globular clusters , and ngc catalogs , to remove any known object that may share the same locus of the / vs. / plane .    for the boss region we ran / using color - magnitude cuts based on four padova evolutionary models @xcite with ages of 8 and 14 gyr and @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "we tuned our cmd filter to search search for objects at five distance moduli @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "visual inspection of the detected candidates was carried out , revealing / as a faint overdensity of blue sources consistent with them being stars .",
    "however , deeper and higher spatial resolution images were required to investigate the nature of /.",
    "in the first semester of 2012 , we obtained follow - up observations of / using megacam , which is installed in the canada - france - hawaii - telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "megacam is a mosaic 36 ccds , each with @xmath20 .",
    "the total field of view ( fov ) is @xmath21 , with a pixel scale of @xmath22 0.19 @xmath23 .",
    "we designed the observations to reach the magnitude of the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) of a @xmath24 gyr stellar population at @xmath25 kpc distance with @xmath26 .",
    "exposure times of @xmath27 s in the @xmath28 band and @xmath29 s in the @xmath30 band were required .",
    "the total exposure time was divided into 6 dithering exposures for each passband to avoid scattered light from bright stars , saturation , and also to cover the smaller gaps between the ccds .",
    "the observations were carried out under photometric conditions , seeing was always below @xmath31 , and the airmass below @xmath32 .",

    "the dashed box shows a @xmath34 region for which we show the combined @xmath28 band image in the",
    "_ top panel_.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the basic reduction of the images ( overscan and bias subtraction , and flatfielding ) was done by the cfht team .",
    "the images were geometrically corrected , registered and co - added by terapix , which uses the astromatic toolkit .",
    "therefore , source detection is based on sextractor",
    ". point spread function ( psf ) photometry was carried out using ` daophot ` @xcite .",
    "the input coordinates list for the stars measured using ` daophot ` was the one provided by terapix .",
    "this list presented less spurious detections than the one from ` daofind ` .",
    "photometric calibration was achieved using bright and non - saturated ( @xmath35 ) stars in the observed field , whose instrumental magnitudes were then compared to those from sdss .",
    "we found 536 matches which we used to find a calibration equation composed of a photometric zero point and a color term .",
    "the equation coefficients were found by means of a least square fit using sigma clipping rejection .",
    "our mean calibration residuals are of @xmath36 in the @xmath28 band and @xmath37 in the @xmath30 band .",
    "the observed megacam field shows little differential reddening . using the dust maps from @xcite we find a value of e(b - v ) = 0.060 at position of balbinot 1 and a standard deviation of 0.0014 across the whole field .",
    "thus , differential reddening is not likely to contribute significantly to our analysis .",
    "nonetheless we choose to correct for reddening using the value of e(b - v ) at the position of each star in the megacam field .",
    "we adopt @xmath38 and the coefficients from @xcite to compute the extinction in the cfht passbands .",
    "figure [ cfht_g ] shows a stacked @xmath28 band image centered on / ( top panel ) .",
    "we also show isodensity contours of our detected sources ( bottom panel ) .",
    "a clear overdensity of stars is seen on both panels of the figure very close to where the / candidate was originally identified .",
    "from figure [ cfht_g ] it is evident that there is a concentration of stellar - like objects in the observed region . to confirm its stellar nature",

    "we not only clearly confirm the excess of stars around the position of / but also conclude that the distribution of these stars on the cmd plane is consistent with a simple stellar population ( ssp ) .",

    "it corresponds to an age of @xmath45 gyr and an abundance of @xmath46 , or [ fe / h ] @xmath47 at a distance of @xmath48 kpc . in the same panel we show the effect of varying the distance modulus within its fit uncertainties .",
    "the isochrone fit was performed by means of a @xmath49 minimization of the cmd distance between the cluster ridge line and the isochrone set .",
    "our model grid goes from 9.8 to 10.12 in @xmath50 with a step of 0.01 , and from 0.0001 to 0.004 in z , with steps of 0.0001 .",
    "we adopt a step of 0.01 in distance modulus and a range from 16.0 to 18.0 .",
    "the best model is the one that minimizes @xmath49 .",
    "the uncertainties are derived from models that have values of @xmath51 .",
    "we stress that the best fit isochrone and its associated parameters are somewhat dependent on the stellar evolution model and on the model grid .",
    "in fact , our quoted metallicity uncertainty is comparable to the padova grid resolution for this parameter . also , the discrepancies among different evolutionary models are much larger than our quoted uncertainties . for a comprehensive approach to this problem",
    "we refer to @xcite .      to quantify the size and concentration of / we built the radial density profile ( rdp ) by counting stars in annuli around its center . to increase contrast relative to the background , only stars within 2@xmath52 in color away from the best fit isochrone were selected , where @xmath52 is the mean photometric error at a given magnitude .",
    "the data was also cut at @xmath53 to avoid photometric incompleteness .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ rdp ] where a very peaked distribution of stars is visible .",
    "error bars in the @xmath54 direction .",
    "the error bars in the @xmath55 direction are the bin sizes .",
    "the solid line shows the best fit king profile .",
    "the dashed vertical line shows the position of the core radius .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the half - mass radius , and the dotted line shows the corresponding plummer profile.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order to avoid the binning complications that arise when trying to fit a rdp we chose a maximum likelihood ( ml ) approach .",
    "the method we use here follows closely the one described in @xcite .",
    "the ml fit was carried out using stars in the range @xmath56 and fitted both a king and a plummer model .",
    "this limit was chosen to avoid the large ccd gap of megacam .",
    "the best fitted models are shown as the solid and dotted lines in figure [ rdp ] , respectively .",
    "for the king profile we derive @xmath57 and @xmath58 . and the plummer profile fit yields @xmath59 and a total number of stars @xmath60 .",
    "the uncertainty in each parameter is estimated using the likelihood - ratio approximation , where likelihood values near the maximum approaches a chi - squared distribution .",
    "the uncertainties are taken as the 90% confidence level of the chi - square distribution .",
    "for the plummer profile we also kept the center of / as a free parameter .",
    "this allowed us to find the best center and its uncertainty .",
    "the best center was then used in the king profile fit .",
    "notice that the upper bound of the tidal radius uncertainty is outside the range of r available in our observations .",
    "for simplicity we have adopted the upper bound as the largest radii available , that is @xmath61 .    for the plummer profile",
    "the half - mass radius is easily obtained from the relation @xmath62 , yielding the value of @xmath63 .",
    "for the king model we made an estimate of the half - mass radius as follows .",
    "we first integrated the profile from zero to the limiting radius and subtracted the expected number of background stars .",
    "the result of this operation yields the total number of observed stars that should belong to / @xmath64 .",
    "we then compute the half - mass radius as the radius which contains @xmath65 stars , again taking care to subtract off the expected background sources .",
    "we obtain @xmath66 .",
    "the two estimates of @xmath11 agree within the uncertainties .",
    "since the plummer model is widely used in most studies of satellites , we choose to use the half - mass radius estimated from it .",
    "the total luminosity of / is dominated by bright red giant branch ( rgb ) stars and possibly a few red clump ( rc ) stars , although figure [ cmd_comp ] does not reveal any obvious rc star in the inner 150@xmath67 region .",
    "the small number of evolved stars in the rgb and , most especially , in the rc , indicates that / is a low mass stellar system , more consistent with being a star cluster than a dwarf galaxy .",
    "given its low stellar mass , to properly estimate the total luminosity of / one must take into account the background ( and foreground ) star contamination .",
    "we first built the observed luminosity function ( lf ) of / by counting stars as a function of magnitude inside a circle of @xmath40 radius from the cluster center and in a ring with inner border at @xmath68 and outer at @xmath69 .",
    "we subtracted the area weighted star counts in the ring from the area weighted counts in the inner circle .",
    "this results in an observed lf for / already decontaminated from field stars .",
    "the adopted ring is 10 times larger than the cluster circle to minimize fluctuations in the subtracted field contamination . to build the lfs we again applied a magnitude cut of @xmath70 to avoid incompleteness .",
    "the total magnitude is obtained by direct integration of the background decontaminated lf . using the uncertainty on each bin of the lf and a bootstrap method",
    "we derive the uncertainty on the total magnitude .",
    "the final value is @xmath71 for /.",
    "coupling the @xmath10 value with the @xmath11 estimate yields a surface brightness of @xmath72 mag / arcsec@xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath10 of / is comparable to the value obtained for muoz 1 .",
