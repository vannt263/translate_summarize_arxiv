    "cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) are close binary systems in which a white dwarf primary star accretes matter by way of roche lobe overflow from a companion ( the secondary ) , which usually resembles a late - type main - sequence star @xcite . because the red - giant precursor of a white dwarf can become much larger than the semimajor axis of a typical cv , it is thought that cvs are remnants of common - envelope evolution .",
    "subsequent evolution proceeds through loss of orbital angular momentum , probably through magnetic braking of the co - rotating secondary , and at the shortest periods through gravitational radiation losses . for most systems ,",
    "the loss of angular momentum causes the orbital period to decrease , but eventually the secondary becomes degenerate , so that subsequent mass loss causes its radius to increase .",
    "if this point has been passed , the orbital period should increase gradually as mass transfer continues .",
    "this evolutionary turnaround , known as the ` period bounce ' , is predicted to occur at orbital period @xmath2 near 65 min , though empirically the minimum period appears to be somewhat longer ( @xmath3 min ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "standard evolutionary theory , then , predicts that few cvs will be found below the period minimum .",
    "also , the gravitational radiation thought to dominate the angular momentum losses at short periods works rather slowly , so a relatively large number of cvs should have periods just longward of the minimum , forming a `` spike '' in the distribution .",
    "until recently , observational evidence for this scenario was somewhat limited .",
    "cvs with hydrogen - rich secondaries do respect the lower period bound ; the few exceptions appear to be either stars that evolved significantly before beginning mass transfer @xcite or unusual objects of other provenance @xcite .",
    "but the distribution of known cv periods did not show the predicted spike @xcite .",
    "the mediocre agreement with theory prompts us to consider how cvs are selected . until recently ,",
    "cvs were detected mostly through photometric variability ( especially dwarf nova outbursts ) , x - ray emission , and ultraviolet color .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey turned up a large number of new cvs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter collectively referred to as szkodysdsscvs ) .",
    "cv colors are unusual because of their composite spectra , with the result that sdss allotted spectroscopic fibers to many of them .",
    "although cv spectra are heterogeneous , they tend to be fairly distinctive , so many of the cvs could be classified with high confidence .",
    "the criteria for allotting spectroscopic fibers to stellar objects were mostly designed to generate a large sample of galaxies and qsos , not to observe every available cv , so there is no assurance that the sdss cv sample is truly complete . nonetheless , the combination of the great depth of sdss , and the lack of bias toward outbursting objects , led to the discovery of a large number of low - luminosity objects just above the period minimum .",
    "@xcite compiled results for 137 sdss cvs ( most of them newly discovered ) , showed that their orbital period distribution was significantly different from previously - known samples , and identified the short - period objects with the long - predicted period spike .    here",
    "we present spectroscopy and orbital periods for 29 cvs ; table [ tab : star_info ] lists the objects and gives the short names we will use for them here .",
    "twenty - two of these were originally discovered in sdss data .",
    "we also include seven more objects which had been known previously but which were recovered in the sdss .",
    "@xcite listed orbital periods for 16 of the objects , and we give the details here .",
    "observations of the remaining objects were not completed until after the @xcite paper was prepared .",
    "the periods for most of these appear here for the first time .",
    "most of the observations reported here are from the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory on kitt peak , arizona , equipped with the modular spectrograph , a 600 line mm@xmath4 grating , and a 2048@xmath5 site ccd ( the ` echelle ' detector ) .",
    "this gave 2.0   pixel@xmath4 and a spectral resolution of @xmath6   from 4210 to 7500  , with strong vignetting toward the ends of the spectral range .",
    "for some of the later observations , we used a 1024@xmath5 site ccd ( ` templeton ' ) , which had the same pixel as ` echelle ' and scale and similar sensitivity , but less spectral coverage ( 4660 to 6730  ) .",
    "the projected slit width was @xmath7 arcsec .",
    "we often observed far from the meridian to resolve ambiguities in the daily cycle count ; when doing this , we rotated the instrument to position the slit near the parallactic angle , to minimize atmospheric dispersion effects @xcitephysics / faculty / skycalc / flyer.html . ] . during twilight we took spectra of bright early - type stars to derive an approximate correction for the telluric bands , flux standard stars when conditions warranted , and he , ne , and xe lamps for wavelength calibration .",
    "for spectra taken during the night , we used the @xmath8 night sky line to establish the velocity zero point .",
    "the night - sky line technique lets us monitor the radial velocities as they come in , making for very efficient use of observing time .",
    "individual exposures were typically 6 - 8 minutes , to avoid smearing the velocities excessively at short periods .",
    "two of the objects , sdss0812 and sdss1028 ( leo5 ) , were bright enough for the mcgraw - hill 1.3 m telescope , also at mdm .",
    "for this we used the mark iii spectrograph , the site 1024@xmath5 ccd ` templeton ' , and a grism giving 2.2   pixel@xmath4 from 4650 to 6980  , with a spectral resolution of 4.0  .    whenever the sky was clear , we observed flux standard stars in twilight .",
    "we estimate that the absolute fluxes are accurate to about 20 percent , because of transparency variations and uncalibratable losses at the 1.1-arcsecond slit .",
    "in addition , the modspec spectra sometimes suffer from irreproducible , wavelength - dependent variations in the response , which can reach 20 or 30 per cent amplitude in individual spectra .",
    "for the most part these average out fairly well when large numbers of spectra are combined .",
    "the @xmath9 magnitudes given in table [ tab : star_info ] were synthesized from our flux - calibrated spectra using the iraf _ sbands _ task and the @xmath9 passband tabulated by @xcite .",
    "our average spectra are included in figs . 1 through 8 ( along with the period searches and folded velocity curves discussed later ) . the line strengths , line profiles , continuum shapes , and flux levels are mostly similar to those in szkodysdsscvs .",
    "the @xmath9 magnitudes inferred from our spectral continua ( table [ tab : star_info ] ) also agree fairly well with the @xmath10 magnitudes from sdss imaging .",
    "we therefore observed most of the systems in states similar to when they were discovered ; exceptions are noted in the discussions of individual objects ( section [ sec : individuals ] ) .",
    "we reduced the mdm data primarily with iraf routines , but for extracting one - dimensional spectra from the two - dimensional images , we used our own implementation of the optimal - extraction algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "to measure radial velocities of the h@xmath11 emission line , we used an algorithm developed by @xcite , in which the line profile is convolved with an antisymmetric function and the zero of the convolution is taken to be the line center .",
    "the antisymmetric function was usually composed of positive and negative gaussians , separated by an interval chosen to emphasize the steep parts of the line profile .",
    "uncertainties in the velocities were estimated by propagating the errors of the counts in each spectral channel , as estimated from photon statistics and read noise ; line - profile variations can introduce scatter significantly larger than this . for absorption - line velocities we used the _ rvsao _ cross - correlation package @xcite ;",
    "the template was the sum of a large number of late - type iau velocity standards shifted to zero velocity .",
    "the _ rvsao _ package estimates velocity uncertainties using the antisymmetric part of the cross - correlation @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : velocities ] lists all the radial velocities .    to search for periods",
    ", we used the ` residual - gram ' algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "we fitted the time series with sinusoids at the best periods ( see @xcite for details ) ; table [ tab : parameters ] lists the parameters of the curves that are plotted in figs . 1  8 .",
    "because essentially all our observations are from a single longitude , the times of observation fall in a limited window _ modulo _",
    "one sidereal day , so period searches inevitably show aliases spaced by 1 cycle d@xmath4 , corresponding to alternate choices of daily cycle count .",
    "we minimized the resulting ambiguities by taking observations over as wide a range of hour angles as possible .",
    "when appropriate , we used the monte carlo test described by @xcite to estimate the reliability of our choice of alias .",
    "a few of our spectra are from the isis double beam spectrograph at the william herschel telescope at la palma .",
    "the instrument configuration , observation procedure , and reductions were essentially as described by @xcite , except that we implemented the @xcite radial - velocity measurements using a python - language program based on pyfits and numpy .",
    "the spectra of cvs sometimes show a contribution from a late type star , which can constrain the distance . to do this",
    ", we use an interactive program to scale and subtract spectra of stars of known spectral type from the program star s spectrum , and adjust the spectral type and scale factor to cancel the late - type features .",
    "the subtracted spectra are either m- and k - dwarfs classified respectively by @xcite or @xcite , and taken with the same instrument as the program star , or sdss m - dwarf templates from @xcite . for each spectral type",
    "giving reasonable cancellation , we estimate the acceptable range of scale factors , and hence the apparent @xmath9 magnitudes of the secondary .",
    "we use the spectral type to find the surface brightness in the @xmath9-band , using data tabulated by @xcite .",
    "the orbital period , together with the assumption that the secondary must fill its roche critical lobe , strongly constrains the secondary s radius @xmath12 : at a given @xmath2 , @xmath12 is roughly proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the secondary s mass . we seldom can measure @xmath14 directly , but using evolutionary scenarios @xcite and the known @xmath2 , we constrain @xmath14 to a broad range of plausible values , which results in a relatively narrow range of radii thanks to the weak dependence .",
    "combining @xmath12 with the surface brightness and radius gives an absolute @xmath9 magnitude . comparing this with the apparent @xmath9 of the secondary s contribution , and including a correction for interstellar extinction ( guided by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gives an estimate of the distance .",
    "note that we do not assume that the secondary is a main - sequence star .    because spectral features tend to grow stronger toward later spectral types , there is often a correlation between the secondary s spectral type and the fraction of the light attributed to it .",
    "we therefore compute the distance and its uncertainty using a monte carlo approach , that is , by running the calculation many times , every time selecting each input value randomly from its possible range .",
    "our quoted distance is the median of the resulting histogram , and the range that includes 68 percent of the results is our quoted `` 1-sigma '' uncertainty .",
    "when picking input values , we select a spectral type and then pick a magnitude based on the allowed range at that spectral type .",
    "this explicitly accounts for the correlation .",
    "@xcite noted that the sdss spectrum of this object shows strong heii @xmath154686 emission , and suggested it may be an intermediate polar ( i.e. , a magnetic system with a white dwarf spin period substantially shorter than @xmath2 ) .",
    "they also found a preliminary period near 2 h. while the present paper was in preparation , @xcite presented a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic study of the object , finding it to be an eclipsing system with @xmath16 d.    our findings largely confirm those of @xcite .",
    "our h@xmath11 velocities give an unambiguous @xmath17 h , which is consistent with the much more precise value they find , and a velocity amplitude identical to theirs . by coincidence , the eclipse epoch given in their ephemeris ( hjd 2455958.59184 ) is less than two weeks from the epoch of our spectroscopic observations , so we can compute eclipse - based phases for our velocities without significant uncertainty . in fig .",
    "1 we show the velocities folded on the eclipse ephemeris .",
    "there is an intriguing indication of a rotational disturbance , i.e. , a displacement toward positive velocity before eclipse , and a negative displacement following eclipse , as expected from the eclipse of a rotating structure .",
    "the catalina real time transient survey , data release 2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter crtts ) gives 308 measurements of this source from 2005 to 2013 .",
    "the source is mostly around 16.3 mag , but with occasional excursions down to fainter than 18th  similar to the eclipse depth seen by @xcite . to see whether the fainter points were consistent with the eclipse , we downloaded the crtts data , corrected the timings to the solar system barycenter , and searched for periodicities near the known eclipse period using a ` string length ' algorithm @xcite . the @xcite period is strongly detected , along with weak aliases corresponding to the annual cycle count",
    "the long time span of the crtts data allowed us to refine the period .",
    "the isolated observations from crtts do not permit the extraction of individual eclipse timings . to constrain the period , we instead varied the period slightly and examined the effect on folded light curves .",
    "as one might expect , the eclipse appeared sharply defined only for a narrow range of periods , namely 0.1369739(2 ) d. the central value is only 1.5 standard deviations from the @xcite period , which is 0.1369745(4 ) d. fig .  [",
    "fig : crtscurves ] shows the crtts magnitudes folded using the refined period .",
    "the spectrum of this object shows a strong contribution from a secondary star along with emission lines and a continuum typical of dwarf novae at minimum light .",
    "however , the crtts shows the source near 18th magnitude without any outbursts detected despite good coverage over eight observing seasons .    we estimate the secondary s spectral type ( see [ sec : secondaries ] ) to be k4 @xmath18 1.5 subtypes , and that it contributes a flux corresponding to @xmath19 mag ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cvplot1 ] ) .",
    "the secondary s absorption - line velocities give a clean determination of the orbital period , which is 5.51 hours ; the h@xmath11 emission velocities are not nearly as well - behaved , but corroborate the absorption - line period .",
    "we have 16 velocities from 2008 january , and only a single point from 2008 march , which happened to fall near maximum velocity .",
    "the orbital frequencies that fit all the data are given approximately by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an integer and @xmath22 .",
    "the secondary star is a little warmer than typically found in systems in this period range @xcite ; given this , the evolutionary scenarios computed by @xcite suggest that its mass is @xmath23 m@xmath24 .",
    "the @xcite give a total reddening @xmath25 for this celestial location ( @xmath26 ) , so the extinction correction is small .",
    "the monte carlo procedure described in sec .",
    "[ sec : secondaries ] gives @xmath27 pc for the distance ; at 2500 pc , the system would be 850 pc from the galactic plane .",
    "the emission - line velocities are so noisy that they do not tell us much about the dynamics of the system , but the absorption velocities should trace the secondary s motion with reasonable fidelity .",
    "the velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath28 km s@xmath4 , is fairly large for this orbital period .",
    "in addition , as noted above , the secondary s relatively early spectral type may indicate that it has not lost much mass . taken together ,",
    "the @xmath29-velocity and secondary mass estimate suggest that the white dwarf is on the massive side , and that the orbital inclination is not too far from edge - on . as an illustration , with @xmath30 km s@xmath4 and assuming @xmath31 m@xmath24 ,",
    "the system would have @xmath32 degrees ( edge - on ) with @xmath33 m@xmath24 ; lower inclinations with these parameters would require still higher white - dwarf masses .",
    "our orbital period is corroborated by @xcite , who find ellipsoidal variations implying @xmath34 d. while they do not detect eclipses , the ellipsoidal variation also suggests a fairly high orbital inclination .",
    "this novalike variable was discovered in the hamburg quasar survey , and rediscovered in the sdss .",
    "@xcite found apparent grazing eclipses ; their complete photometric data set was best fit with @xmath35 hr , but the eclipses alone could not rule out a period near 3.04 hr ; @xcite cite the 3.22-hr period .",
    "@xcite modeled the system using ultraviolet and optical spectra .",
    "our spectra come from four observing runs , but all appear similar , with a strong blue continuum and balmer , hei , and heii emission lines .    our best radial - velocity period , near 3.2068 hr , agrees roughly with the period adopted by @xcite and @xcite , but disagrees on a finer scale .",
    "@xcite find 0.1340385(84 ) d , or 3.2169(2 ) hr , based on a count of 313 cycles in between their first and second grazing eclipse ( their table 1 ) , but our radial velocities are not fit well at that period .",
    "however , an alternate fit assuming 314 cycles between their first two eclipses gives a best - fit period near 3.2069 h , in excellent agreement with the best choice of spectroscopic alias .",
    "the 314-cycle eclipse fit is not quite as good  while their first two eclipses fit almost perfectly , their last two miss by @xmath36 and @xmath37 s respectively  but their best fit already shows deviations nearly this large , so the grazing eclipse evidently jitters somewhat in phase .",
    "remarkably , although the radial velocity periodogram is riddled with aliases generated by different choices of cycle count between observing runs , the single best - fitting alias is the _ only _ radial - velocity alias that is compatible with the 314-cycle eclipse ephemeris . because of this concordance , we are reasonably sure we have chosen the long - term velocity correctly , and quote the period in table  [ tab : parameters ] with a correspondingly small uncertainty .",
    "@xcite include this object in a sample of sw sex stars . in eclipsing sw sex stars ,",
    "the emission - line radial velocity curves and eclipses are offset in phase , in the sense that the eclipse occurs somewhat earlier than one would expected if the emission lines traced the white dwarf s motion .",
    "fortunately , our radial velocities and the eclipses observed by @xcite were obtained fairly close together in time ",
    "close enough so that we can compare their phases .",
    "the zero point of their eclipse ephemeris ( their eqn .",
    "5 ) occurs 2555.348(44 ) cycles after our radial - velocity epoch ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "the radial - velocity is the red - to - blue crossing of the emission lines , so if the emission lines traced the white dwarf , the eclipse would occur at phase @xmath38 in the radial velocity epehmeris . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the eclipse indeed occurs early , by @xmath40 degrees of phase .",
    "this is similar to the phase offset seen in other sw sex stars .",
    "sw sex stars tend to show absorption features in the hei lines that appear at positive velocities around phase 0.3 - 0.4 , drift toward lower velocity , and then disappear sometime after phase 0.5 .",
    "[ fig : sdss0809trail ] shows a phase - averaged greyscale representation of our spectra .",
    "the phase - dependent absorption is obvious , and behaves exactly as expected for an sw sex star .",
    "the balmer lines have similar behavior , which is obscured here by the choice of greyscale .",
    "the mg lines around 5170 also have transient absorption , a feature seen in px and as well @xcite .",
    "there is also a pair of weak features around @xmath41 6348 and 6371 , which we tentatively identify as siii .",
    "heii @xmath155411 is weakly visible in emission , without transient absorption .",
    "@xcite classified this as an sw sex star without benefit of time - series spectroscopy .",
    "the more detailed data presented here resoundingly confirm their classification , as well as refining the orbital period .",
    "@xcite present three nights of time - series photometry of this object that shows eclipses with a period of 0.160046(46 ) d and a depth of somewhat over 1 mag .",
    "our radial velocity period , 0.1600(2 ) d , is consistent with this but somewhat less precise .",
    "they also find evidence for a periodicity near 0.148159 d , which they interpret as a possible negative superhump .",
    "the spectrum has a blue continuum and rather modest emission lines ",
    "h@xmath11 has an equivalent width of about 27   and a fwhm @xmath42 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the spectrum , and the 3.84 h orbital period , suggests that this is a novalike variable , or possibly a z cam - type dwarf nova in an extended standstill .",
    "negative superhumps are usually seen in novalikes in this period range , so the possible negative superhump would tend to favor the novalike interpretation .",
    "also , the crtss light curve shows the source steady , with occasional downward excursions in which the object was apparently caught in eclipse ( see below ) , while a z cam star would be expected to return to quiescence from time to time .",
    "the sdss spectrum shows only a weak bump near heii @xmath43 , suggesting that this is not a magnetic system .",
    "the phase - averaged spectrum ( not shown ) does not show phase - dependent absorption , suggesting that this is not an sw sex star .",
    "because of the eclipse , we examined the crtts magnitudes using the procedures described for sdss j07568 + 0858 .",
    "this resulted in a refined @xmath44 d. fig .",

    "the spectrum and orbital period of this object are consistent with a novalike variable , though it could also be a z cam star in an extended high state .",
    "the crtts light curve shows only irregular variations between 16.5 and 17.5 magnitude , which suggests that this is a novalike .",
    "this is an su uma - type dwarf nova , with a @xmath98 near 0.0794 d , or 114.3 min @xcite .",
    "the emission lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cvplot8 ] ) are single - peaked , suggesting a fairly low orbital inclination . combining our measured orbital period , 110.3(2 ) minutes , with @xmath98",
    "gives a fractional superhump period excess @xmath127 , which is close to the expected value for this @xmath2 .",
    "as @xcite emphasize , the sdss has brought us significantly closer to a true accounting of the cv period distribution ; in particular , over 30 per cent of their sample of 92 cvs discovered in the sdss had periods lying in a ` spike ' in the distribution , which they defined as being from roughly 80 to 86 minutes .",
    "the shortest - period object in the present sample is lv cnc ( = sdss j09197 + 0857 ) , at 81.3 min ; the next - shortest is v1227 her (= sdss j16539 + 2010 ) , at 90.9 minutes .",
    "lv cnc is therefore the only object in the ` spike ' .",
    "the white dwarf in lv cnc is readily apparent in the spectrum , which marks it as one of the least luminous objects in the sample .",
    "evidently , the present sample can not be taken as representative , because it is skewed toward higher luminosities .",
    "this is not surprising , since spectroscopy of fainter targets can be very difficult . it is fortunate , then , that many of the shortest - period cvs undergo superoutbusts and show superhumps , which can be used to derive approximate periods that are good enough for many purposes ( see , e.g .. @xcite ) .    in general , longer - period systems",
    "tend to be more luminous @xcite , and hence more amenable to spectroscopy . indeed , eleven of the 29 systems discussed here have periods longer than three hours  in order of increasing period , they are sdss0813 , 1610 , 0809 , 0756 , 1659 , 1028 , 0812 , 0916 , 0844 , 0805 , and 1619 . as noted above , it is relatively easy to find rough orbital periods for short - period dwarf novae that show superoutbursts .",
    "spectroscopic studies such as the present one are needed in part to ensure that the distribution of known cv periods does not become skewed toward the short end .    the number of known and suspected cvs has exploded in recent years because of deep , all - sky variability surveys such as the crtts , asas - sn@xcite , and master @xcite . however , because of the enormous number of variable stars in the sky , only objects with large - amplitude variability tend to be flagged as cvs ; in the crtts , for example , only objects with @xmath128 mag are flagged as cv candidates @xcite .",
    "the sample of crtts cvs is consequently biased toward large outburst amplitudes @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , though , @xcite , reviewing more than 1000 crtts dwarf nova discoveries over the past eight years , find that the rate at which crtts discovers _ frequently outbursting _ objects has slowed dramatically , while the rate at which it is finding objects that show no previous outbursts has _ not _ slowed significantly .",
    "this suggests that there is a sizable population of quiescent dwarf novae  or , more properly , dwarf novae with very long outburst recurrence times  waiting to be discovered .",
    "the sdss cv sample , which was selected by color and spectrum , supports this idea .",
    "seven of the objects in the present sample ( sdss0805 , 0919 , 0945 , 1013 , 1132 , 1504 , and 1656 ) have spectra consistent with dwarf novae at minimum light , but without known outbursts , even though some have been covered extensively by crtts .",
    "variability surveys have also tended to miss other classes of cvs that are not dwarf novae  the so - called novalike variables .",
    "the present sample has some seven of these , namely sdss0756 , 0809 , 0812 , 0813 , 1028 ( which may be a z cam - type dwarf nova ) , 1429 , and 1659 .",
    "it s likely , then , that as new cvs are discovered , they will mostly be ( a ) dwarf novae that seldom outburst  possibly with arbitrarily long recurrence times  and ( b ) various kinds of novalike variables . since essentially _ all _",
    "cataclysmic binaries that actively transfer matter are variable stars , these might be found by looking for lower - amplitude variables in surveys such as crtts , and sifting these for unusual colors . in the more distant future ,",
    "a careful analysis of the large synoptic survey telescope data should find essentially every cv in the southern sky to an impressive magnitude limit .",
    "for convenience , we list here some noteworthy results on individual objects :    1 .",
