    "recently , critical behaviour of models with absorbing states is attracting a lot of interest @xcite .",
    "a lot of such models appeared mainly due to a large number of phenomena where they are potentially applicable , such as , for example , in spreading of fires or epidemics , heterogeneous catalysis or granular flows .",
    "yet another motivation comes from the intriguing idea that critical behaviour of these nonequilibirum systems can be , at least to some extent , categorized and understood in an analogous way to equilibrium systems , where the notions of scale invariance , universality , and renormalization group turned out to be so fruitful and productive  @xcite .",
    "a prominent and strong indication that the universality is indeed common also among nonequilibrium systems comes with directed percolation ( dp ) .",
    "defined in a simple mathematical way , this spreading process turns out to exhibit the critical behaviour , which is very robust and appears in a number of other models as well as in some experimental realizations @xcite .",
    "a common feature of systems exibiting the dp criticality is that they have a single ( or effectively single ) absorbing state .",
    "the ubiquity of the dp critical behaviour prompted three decades ago janssen @xcite and grassberger @xcite to formulate a conjecture that all continuous transitions in systems with a single absorbing state and lacking extra symmetry or conservation law will belong to the dp universality class .",
    "up to now , there are plenty of numerical examples supporting this conjecture @xcite .",
    "models with multiple absorbing states might also belong to the dp universality class @xcite but in some cases they exhibit a different behaviour @xcite .",
    "absorbing states appear also in some ecological or tumor growth models , where they correspond to the extinction of one or more species or types of cells . in some cases",
    "the critical points in these models were shown to belong to the directed percolation universality class @xcite . however , an implementation of biologically relevant factors , such as , for example , inter- or intra - species competition , food supply , aging , birth or death , results in rather complex dynamics .",
    "hence , a violation of the grassberger and janssen conjecture can not be excluded in such models .    in the present paper , we examine the critical behaviour of a recently introduced tumor growth model @xcite .",
    "our previous report @xcite suggested that despite a single absorbing state , the critical behaviour of this model differs from the expected dp universality class .",
    "having performed much more extensive and detailed analysis , in the present paper we confirm the non - dp criticality of the model .",
    "the apparent violation of the grassberger and janssen conjecture occurs in a very intricate way : only some exponents take non - dp values while some others , including all spreading - dynamics exponents , coincide with their dp counterparts .",
    "nevertheless , some scaling and hyper - scaling relations seem to be satisfied in our model .",
    "in our model , each site of a @xmath15-dimensional lattice of linear size @xmath16 either is occupied by tumor , nutrient , both tumor and nutrient , or is empty . at a rate @xmath17 ,",
    "nutrients are supplied to a chosen site of the lattice , provided that the site is not already occupied by a nutrient .",
    "the roulette - wheel selection  @xcite is used to choose the site for such a supply and the corresponding weight  @xmath18 depends on whether the site is occupied by tumor ( @xmath19 ) or not ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 takes into account the angiogenic effects of increased nutrients supply due to formation of new blood vessels in the vicinity of tumor cells . at a rate @xmath22 , a tumor cell is updated on a randomly chosen site .",
    "the tumor cell survives provided that there is a nutrient on this site , otherwise it dies .",
    "the surviving tumor cell consumes the nutrient and attempts to breed provided that there is a site without a tumor cell among its nearest neighbours .",
    "some preliminary results on this model were already reported @xcite .",
    "closely related models but without any preference in nutrient supply ( @xmath23 ) were also studied  @xcite .      to examine our model , we used monte carlo simulations . to facilitate more extensive simulations",
    ", we implemented an algorithm where a site is selected only from among active sites , i.e. , sites that are either without nutrients or with tumor cells .",
    "maintaining the lists of such sites requires some bookkeeping but it speeds up the simulations substantially , especially in the vicinity of the critical point ( where most sites are inactive ) .",
    "we checked that the simpler algoritm that does not keep the list of active sites and the present algorithm yield statistically the same results with respect both to static as well as to dynamic characteristics .    for various  @xmath17 and  @xmath24 , we measured the steady - state densities of tumor cells  @xmath25 and of nutrients  @xmath26 .",
    "simulations started from a random initial configuration and the model relaxed until a steady state was reached . to ensure that the obtained results are @xmath16-independent , we examined lattices of various sizes . assuming that @xmath25 is an order parameter",
    ", we expected that upon approaching the critical point ( @xmath27 ) , it decays as @xmath28 , where @xmath0 is a characteristic exponent .",
    "we also measured the time dependence of the tumor cell density  @xmath29 ( with the unit of time corresponding to  @xmath30 update attempts ) .",
    "the density @xmath29 for each @xmath31 is an average over independent runs . at the critical point",
    ", the density  @xmath29 is expected to have a power - law decay @xmath32 , where  @xmath1 is another characteristic exponent  @xcite .",
    "some other exponents can be extracted assuming the following scaling form of the tumor cell density @xcite @xmath33 in particular , from the finite - size scaling analysis of the density @xmath29 at the critical point ( @xmath27 ) , we can estimate the dynamical exponent @xmath3 from the collapse of the suitably rescaled @xmath29 for various @xmath16 . with a similar procedure , the exponent @xmath5 which describes the divergence of the temporal correlation length ( @xmath34 ) ,",
    "can be estimated from the off - critical steady - state data .",
    "the divergence of the spatial correlation length @xmath35 is characterized with the exponent @xmath2 ( @xmath36 ) . for finite - size systems at criticality",
    "this exponent governs also the vanishing of the steady - state order parameter @xcite @xmath37    further information about the critical behaviour of our model can be obtained using the so - called spreading dynamics . in this technique",
    "one starts the simulation from a nearly - absorbing configuration and monitors the characteristics of the runs . in the case of our model",
    ", we started the simulations from the configuration where one site contains both a nutrient and a tumor cell and all other sites are filled only with nutrients .",
    "we measured the average number ( not density ) of tumor cells ( @xmath38 ) , the survival probability @xmath39 that a given run survives until time @xmath31 , and the mean square of spreading of tumor cells from the origin @xmath40 . at criticality one",
    "expects that @xmath41 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are characteristic exponents of the spreading process .",
    "moreover , from the decay of the long - time limit of the survival probability @xmath42 we can extract yet another characteristic exponent @xmath4 .",
    "there are a number of examples showing that for models with a single absorbing state , the dynamical exponent @xmath3 and the spreading exponent @xmath8 are equal .",
    "a violation of @xmath43 equality was reported in some nonequilibrium ising models but it was attributed to the missing absorbing phase @xcite . moreover , for models with multiple absorbing states , the exponent  @xmath8 might depend on the absorbing state that is chosen in spreading - dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the above critical exponents are not entirely independent . for models like directed percolation or contact process @xmath44 , @xmath45",
    ", @xmath46 and some plausible scaling arguments can be used to derive the following hyperscaling relation @xcite @xmath47 for models with multiple absorbing states the hyperscaling relation is expected to hold in a more general version @xcite @xmath48 and in general @xmath49 .    using scaling assumptions",
    "one can also show that @xcite @xmath50 moreover , the dynamical exponent @xmath3 , which is defined from the relation @xmath51 , must of course satisfy the equality @xmath52      to supplement monte carlo simulations , we investigated the behaviour of our model using the mean - field approximation .",
    "the general strategy to develop such an approach is to write a master equation and then solve it using some decoupling procedure @xcite . in the first step one",
    "sums the states of all but one site . as a result ,",
    "one obtains equations describing the time evolution of probabilities for single - site configurations .",
    "such equations will contain probabilities of more complex configurations ( i.e. , two - site configurations ) , which need to be factorized subsequently ( i.e. , approximated with some products of probabilities of single - site configurations ) .",
    "eventually , each term contributing to the evolution of single - site probabilities will contain the probability that a chosen site is in an appropriate state ( for a given process ) and the rate of that process . in some processes",
    ", neighboring sites also give some contributions .",
    "using the following notation for a probability of a site being in particular state @xmath53 one arrives at the following equations describing the time evolution of the probabilites ( densities )  @xmath54 , @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "solving numerically the above set of equations , we determined the single - site probabilites and thus the tumor ( @xmath59 ) and the nutrient ( @xmath60 ) densities . to control the accuracy of the numerical procedure",
    ", one can check whether the obtained probabilites satisfy the obvious normalization condition @xmath61 .",
    "first , we describe the results for the @xmath12 version of the model . the already reported results of simulations show @xcite that , for a sufficiently large  @xmath17 , the model remains in an active phase with @xmath62 , which terminates at a critical point  @xmath63 ( which depends on  @xmath24 ) . for @xmath64 , the steady state of the model",
    "is an absorbing state @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( tumor cells die out and the system gets filled with nutrients ) . at @xmath27 ,",
    "the model undergoes a phase transition from an active into an absorbing phase and we expect that @xmath25 is the corresponding order parameter .",
    "as it is already known , models with a single absorbing state are expected to belong to the so - called directed - percolation  ( dp ) universality class  @xcite . in this universality class and for @xmath12 , the critical exponent @xmath67 and the decay of the order parameter upon approaching the critical point",
    "is described by the exponent @xmath68 .",
    "numerical simulations show @xcite that for @xmath23 ( i.e. , with no preference for placing the nutrients ) the model belongs indeed to the dp universality class .",
