    "it is well known that three most important ( twist-2 ) parton distributions functions ( pdf ) in a nucleon are the non - polarized distribution function @xmath0 , the longitudinal spin distribution @xmath1 and the transverse spin distribution @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the first two have been more or less successfully measured experimentally in classical deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments but the measurement of the last one is especially difficult since it belongs to the class of the so - called chiral - odd structure functions and can not be seen there .",
    "the non - polarized pdf s was measured for decades and are rather well known in wide range of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "its behavior in @xmath4 is well described by the qcd evolution equation ( dglap ) and serves as one of the main source of @xmath5 determination .",
    "the most recent parametrization of these functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the main problem here is the very small @xmath3 behavior .",
    "summing the leading @xmath6 with the help of the bfkl equation predicts a rather quick rise of @xmath7 which seems to find some experimental support .",
    "recent calculations of nll corrections , however , cardinally change this situation @xcite .",
    "another problem is the flavor asymmetry of the sea quarks connected with the break down of the gottfried sum rule @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal spin pdf s draw common attention during last decade in connection with the famous `` spin crisis '' , i.e. astonishingly small portion of the proton spin carried by quarks ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the most popular explanation of this phenomenon is large contribution of the gluon spin @xmath8 .",
    "the direct check of this hypothesis is one of the main problem of future dedicated experiments like compass at cern .",
    "even now , however , there are some indication to considerable value of @xmath8 coming from the @xmath4 evolution of the polarized pdf s @xcite with the result @xmath9 at @xmath10 and from the first direct experimental probe of @xmath8 by hermes collaboration @xcite with the result @xmath11 in the region @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "the latter is in reasonable agreament with large @xmath13 limit prediction @xcite @xmath14 for not very small @xmath3 .",
    "the gluon spin distributions obtained from ( * left * ) fit of @xmath4 evolution of polarized pdf s @xcite ( ( a ) without e155 data and ( b ) including e155 ) and ( * right * ) from high @xmath15 events in semi inclusive dis @xcite .",
    "the curves present different fits of polarized dis .",
    "another problem here is the sea quark spin asymmetry .",
    "it is usually assumed in fitting the experimental data that @xmath16 .",
    "ad hoc _ assumption however contradicts with large @xmath13 limit prediction @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this was previously discovered for the instanton model @xcite and supported by calculations in the chiral quark soliton model @xcite .",
    "also this agrees with the phenomenological approach based on `` pauly blocking principle '' @xcite .",
    "an indication to a nonzero value for @xmath18 was also observed in @xcite .",
    "turn now to dis with transversely polarized target .",
    "a new result on the structure function @xmath19 was recently reported by e155x collaboration @xcite .",
    "its twist-2 part is well defined by the structure function @xmath20 _ via _ wandzura - wilczek relation @xcite g_2^ww(x , q^2)=-g_1(x , q^2)+ _",
    "x^1g_1(y , q^2 ) and the deflection off this is just pure dynamical twist-3 contribution .",
    "this deflection have to be small however due to two exact sum rules automatically valid for the ww - part : the burkhardt - cottingham @xcite _ 0 ^ 1dx g_1(y , q^2)=0 and efremov - leader - teryaev @xcite _ 0 ^ 1dxx(g_1^val(y , q^2)+2g_2^val(x , q^2))=0    concerning the transversity distribution it was completely unknown experimentally till recent time .",
    "the only information comes from the soffer inequality @xcite @xmath21 $ ] which follows from density matrix positivity . to access these chiral - odd structure functions one needs either to scatter two polarized protons and to measure the transversal spin correlation @xmath22 in drell - yan process ( what is the problem for future rhic ) or to know the transverse polarization of the quark scattered from transversely polarized target .",
    "there are several ways to do this :    1 .   to measure a polarization of a self - analyzing hadron to which the quark fragments in a semi inclusive dis ( sidis ) , e.g. @xmath23-hyperon @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this method however is a rather low rate of quark fragmentation into @xmath23-particle ( @xmath24 ) and especially that it is mostly sensitive to @xmath25-quark polarization .",
    "2 .   to measure a transverse handedness in multi - particle parton fragmentation @xcite , i.e. the correlation of the quark spin 4-vector @xmath26 and particle momenta @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is a jet 4-momentum ) .",
    "3 .   to use a new spin dependent t - odd parton fragmentation function ( pff ) @xcite responsible for the left - right asymmetry in one particle fragmentation of transversely polarized quark with respect to quark momentum ",
    "spin plane .",
    "( the so - called `` collins asymmetry '' @xcite . )    the last two methods are comparatively new and only in the last years some experimental indications to the transversal handedness and to the t - odd pff have appeared @xcite .",
    "the latter result was used @xcite to extract the information on the proton transversity distribution were used .",
    "our approach is free of any adjustable parameters . ] from recently observed azimuthal asymmetry in sidis by hermes @xcite collaboration and by smc @xcite",
    ". this will be the subject of the rest of my talk .",
    "analogous of pdf s @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the pff s @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which describe the fragmentation of a non - polarized quark into a non - polarized hadron and a longitudinally or transversely polarized quark into a longitudinally or transversely polarized hadron , respectively .",
    "these pff s are integrated over the transverse momentum @xmath34 of a hadron with respect to a quark . with @xmath34 taken into account , new pff s",
    "arise . using the lorentz- and p - invariance",
    "one can write in the leading twist approximation 8 independent spin structures @xcite .",
    "most spectacularly it is seen in the helicity basis where one can build 8 twist-2 combinations , linear in spin matrices of the quark and hadron @xmath35 , @xmath36 with momenta @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "especially interesting is a new chiral - odd structure that describes a left ",
    "right asymmetry in the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a function of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath41 and quark transverse momentum @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 is the averaged transverse momentum of the final hadron . instead of @xmath44 .",
    "] since the @xmath40 term is chiral - odd , it makes possible to measure the proton transversity distribution @xmath31 in semi - inclusive dis from a transversely polarized target by measuring the left - right asymmetry of forward produced pions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it serves as analyzing power of the collins effect .",
    "the problem is that , first , this function was completely unknown till recent time both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "second , the function @xmath40 is the so - called t - odd fragmentation function : under the naive time reversal @xmath45 and @xmath35 change sign , which demands a purely imaginary ( or zero ) @xmath40 in the contradiction with naive hermiticity .",
    "this , however , does not mean the break of t - invariance but rather the presence of an interference of different channels in forming the final state with different phase shifts , like in the case of single spin asymmetry phenomena  @xcite . a simple model for this function could be found in  @xcite .. ] ( in this aspect they are very different with the t - odd pdf s which can not exist since they are purely real .",
    "interaction among initial hadrons which could brings an imaginary part breaks the factorization and the whole parton picture . )",
    "thus , the situation here is far from being clear .",
    "meanwhile , the data collected by delphi ( and other lep experiments ) give a possibility to measure @xmath40 .",
    "the point is that despite the fact that the transverse polarization of quarks in z@xmath46 decay is very small ( @xmath47 ) , there is a non - trivial correlation between transverse spins of a quark and an antiquark in the standard model : @xmath48 , which are at @xmath49 peak : @xmath50 and @xmath51 . with the production cross section ratio @xmath52",
    "this gives for the average over flavors value @xmath53 .",
    "the transverse spin correlation results in a peculiar azimuthal angle dependence of produced hadrons , if the t - odd fragmentation function @xmath40 does exist  @xcite .",
    "a simpler method has been proposed by an amsterdam group @xcite .",
    "they predict a specific azimuthal asymmetry of a hadron in a jet around the axis in direction of a second hadron in the opposite jet dependence was assumed for @xmath54 and @xmath55 and integrated over @xmath56 . ]",
    "@xmath57 ^ 2 c_{tt}^{q\\bar q}{\\sin^2\\theta_2\\over 1+\\cos^2\\theta_2}\\cos(2\\phi_1)\\right ) \\ , , \\label{mulders}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 is the polar angle of the electron and the second hadron momenta @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the azimuthal angle counted off the @xmath61-plane .",
    "this asymmetry was recently measured @xcite using the delphi data collection . for the leading charged particles ( mostly pions ) in each jet of two - jet events , summed over @xmath41 and averaged over quark flavors ( assuming @xmath62 is flavor independent ) , the most reliable preliminary value of the analyzing power is found to be    @xmath63    with presumably large systematic errors .-",
    "scattering @xcite . ]",
    "the azimuthal asymmetries measured by hermes for sidis with @xmath64 and @xmath65 production on longitudinally polarized target are    a_ul^w=2  , [ asymw ] where @xmath66 or @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the nucleon polarization .",
    "it consists of two sorts terms @xcite : a twist-2 asymmetry @xmath67 a_ul^2- , [ atwist2 ] and a twist-3 asymmetry @xmath69 . a_ul^.",
    "[ atwist3 ] here @xmath70 is the azimuthal angle around the @xmath41-axis opposite to direction of virtual @xmath71 momentum in the lab frame , counted from the electron scattering plane .",
    "the first asymmetry is proportional to the @xmath15-dependent transverse quark spin distribution in longitudinally polarized proton , @xmath72 , while the second one contains two parts : one term is proportional to the twist-3 distribution function @xmath73 and the second one proportional to the twist-3 interaction dependent correction to the fragmentation function @xmath74 .",
    "we will systematically disregard this interaction dependent correction ( just as in the wandzura - wilczek relation ) .",
    "@xcite . as for @xmath74",
    ", it disappears after integration over @xmath41 due to relation @xcite @xmath75 . ]    in the same approximation , the integrated functions over the quark transverse momentum , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are expressed through the transversity @xmath31 h_1l^(1)(x)d^2p_t ( ) h_1l^(x , p_t)=-x^2_x^1dh_1()/^2=-(x/2)h_l(x ) , [ wwform ]    assume now that only the favored fragmentation functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 will contribute this ratios , i.e. @xmath78 and similarly for @xmath79 .",
    "this would allow us to extract from the observed hermes asymmetries an information on @xmath80 and to compare with some model prediction .",
    "instead , we use the prediction of the chiral soliton model @xcite for @xmath81 and the grv parametrization @xcite for unpolarized pdf s @xmath82 to calculate the asymmetries @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the comparison of the asymmetries thus obtained with the hermes experimental data is presented on fig .",
    "single spin azimuthal asymmetry for @xmath85 ( * left * ) and @xmath86 ( * right * ) : @xmath83 ( squares ) and @xmath84 ( circles ) as a functions of x. the solid ( @xmath83 ) and the dashed lines ( @xmath84 ) correspond to the chiral quark - soliton model calculation at @xmath87 .",
    "the shaded areas represent the uncertainty in the value of the analyzing power ( [ apower ] ) .",
    "the agreement is good enough though the experimental errors are yet rather large .",
    "the sign of the asymmetry is uncertain since only the modulus of the analyzing power ( [ apower ] ) is known .",
    "2 gives evidence for positive sign .",
    "notice that in spite of the factor @xmath88 in the exp .",
    "( [ atwist3 ] ) it is several times larger than ( [ atwist2 ] ) for moderate @xmath4 .",
    "that is why this asymmetry prevails for the hermes data where @xmath89 .",
    "one can thus state that the effective chiral quark soliton model @xcite gives a rather realistic picture of the proton transversity @xmath81 .",
    "the interesting observable related to @xmath2 is the proton tensor charge .",
    "the calculation in this model yields @xcite @xmath90 .",
    "compare this with most recent experimental value of the proton axial charge @xcite @xmath91 and the value obtained in the same model @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "these very different values for the axial and tensor charges of the nucleon are in contradiction with the nonrelativistic quark model prediction .",
    "in conclusion , using the preliminary estimation for collins effect analyzing power from delphi data and the effective chiral quark soliton model for the proton transversity distribution we obtain a rather good description of the azimuthal asymmetries in semi - inclusive hadron production measured by hermes and smc , though the experimental errors are yet large .",
    "this , however , is only the first experiments !",
    "we would like to stress that our description has no free adjustable parameters .",
    "probably the most useful lesson we have learned is that to measure transversity in sidis in the region of moderate @xmath4 it is not necessary to use a transversely polarized target . due to",
    "approximate wandzura - wilczek type relations ( [ wwform ] ) one can explore the longitudinally polarized target also .",
    "this is very important for future experiments , like compass at cern since the proton transversity could be measured * simultaneously * with the spin gluon distribution @xmath8 .",
