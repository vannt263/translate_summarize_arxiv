    "the glass transition and slow glassy dynamics are phenomena most widely studied in the context of supercooled liquids and polymer melts angel96,ang88 .",
    "important progress has been made in understanding the complexity of these phenomena by combining dynamical approaches with the concept of an underlying energy landscape , as is discussed in detail in other chapters of this volume .",
    "for example , on the level of the mean field theory of glasses , it has been demonstrated that the dynamical , ideal mode coupling theory @xcite and energy landscape based replica mean field theories describe the same underlying physics , yet from rather different perspectives @xcite .",
    "novel replica approaches have been developed to characterize the emergence of a metastable amorphous solid mon95,franz95,mepa98.1,mepa98.2 .",
    "in addition , droplet arguments have been proposed to include important physics beyond the pure mean field description and led to the formulation of the random first order transition theory of glasses @xcite .",
    "the latter is particularly important if one wants to make specific predictions for experiments that require one to go beyond the mean field limit @xcite .",
    "this random first order transition theory of glasses with an underlying entropy crisis @xcite offers a general and quantitative description of structural glasses .",
    "in addition , it defines a universality class for complex many body systems that is of importance for a much larger class of materials .    .",
    "for a specific case of a structural glass @xmath0 plays a role of density of the local atomic configurations .",
    "glassy behavior is characterized by the emergence of large number of metastable states separated by high energy barriers . ]",
    "glassy dynamics usually occurs when a system is supercooled below a first order transition to an ordered state . in supercooled liquids",
    "this ordered state is the crystalline solid .",
    "if one applies the same ideas to systems with charge or spin collective degrees of freedom in a correlated material , the ordered state corresponds to an electron crystal or an ordered magnetic state .",
    "the equilibrium state is therefore ordered .",
    "supercooling the liquid state is possible once the nucleation barriers are high .",
    "thus , in what follows we ignore this ordered state and consider time scales that are short compared to the nucleation time @xmath1 .",
    "one can now ask the question whether and for how long one can still consider the supercooled liquid in local equilibrium . here , by local equilibrium we mean that the system is ergodic and all configurations are being explored with a probability given by the boltzmann distribution ( only excluding the sharp peak that corresponds to the ordered state ) .",
    "one expects that this supercooled state will fall out of equilibrium over very long time scales , i.e. behave nonergodically , once the barriers between distinct configurations of comparable energy become very large , fig .",
    "if this happens , the system will explore only a subset of the available phase space and will eventually freeze .",
    "suppose there are @xmath2 of such metastable configurations , that are separated by high barriers , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . a calorimetric measurement",
    "will then yield an entropy that is reduced by @xmath3compared to the ergodic situation , where @xmath4 is referred to as the configurational entropy .",
    "if @xmath2 is exponentially large in the system size , @xmath4 becomes extensive and the dynamically frozen state strictly speaking does not obey the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "for liquids it appears that @xmath5 on infinite time scales would extrapolate to zero at a temperature @xmath6 .",
    "extrapolating further to @xmath7 would give @xmath5 less then zero .",
    "this is the entropy crisis of kauzmann [ 16 ] .",
    "such a crisis is avoided by an ideal glass transition in the models highlighted here .",
    "a crucial question to explore is under what circumstances the configurational entropy is a well defined and meaningful concept .",
    "metastable states become sharp conceptually only within a mean field theory description , where barriers can be infinitely high and a system might get trapped in a local minimum of phase space forever . within mean field theory , the number of states that are separated by high barriers proliferates at the mode coupling temperature @xmath8 . the sudden onset of @xmath9 at @xmath10",
    "should not be misunderstood to mean that new configurations emerge at that temperature .",
    "these configurations were present already in the liquid state above @xmath8 .",
    "what happens at @xmath8 is that the barriers grow and that the system s dynamics becomes _ localized in configuration space_. it is this localization in configuration space that is the key element of the random first order theory ( not the ultimate glass transition ) . within mean field theory",
    "the system freezes right at @xmath8 , while activated events , that are a key element of the theory , allow for a slowed down dynamics even below @xmath8 , reflecting the fact that those barriers are large but finite .",
    "one might criticize this approach since going beyond mean field theory does not allow for a sharp thermodynamic definition of @xmath4 .",
    "however , there are well known examples that demonstrate the opposite : understanding overheated or supercooled phases close to a first order transition also starts from the mean field concept of a local minimum in the energy landscape . once supplemented with an appropriate droplet theory of the metastable state it yields a description of the nucleation dynamics at first order transitions@xcite .",
    "the logic used in the random first order theory of glasses is very similar .",
    "one first develops a mean field theory and then supplements it by an appropriate droplet calculation that clearly goes beyond strict mean field theory .",
    "there are numerous indications that the underlying principles that govern glassy behavior in supercooled liquids apply to other many body systems as well .",
    "generally , glassy systems are characterized by slow relaxations and a broad spectrum of excitations , a behavior found in a number of strongly correlated hard condensed matter physics systems .",
    "a particularly interesting situation occurs when interactions , that change very differently with distance , compete with one another . in such",
    "_ uniformly frustrated systems _ an intermediate length scale can emerge that leads to new spatial structures and inhomogeneities . a classical example is a ferromagnet where finite range exchange interactions compete with the long range dipole - dipole interactions and leads to the formation of magnetic domains .",
    "similar behavior is in fact abundant in a number of correlated electron systems .",
    "examples are stripe formation in doped mott insulators stripe , stripe2,mang01,millis96,dagotto , nmr01,nmr02,nmr03,nmr3b , nmr04,msr01,msr02 , defect formation in two - dimensional electron systems popovich07,spivak2006,2dspivak2010 , bubbles of electronic states of high landau levels in quantum hall systems @xcite , magnetic domains in magnetic multilayer compounds @xcite , and mesoscopic structures formed in self - assembly systems @xcite .",
    "these systems typically exhibit a multi - time - scale dynamics similar to the relaxation found in glasses .",
    "this observation suggests that glassy behavior and large relaxation times are caused by the competition of interactions with different characteristic length scales popovic2002,popovic2,vlad2002,denis2002,ohta86,kivelson , nussinov , schmalian , sww00,wsw03,wsw04 , and not primarily due to the presence of strong disorder in the system . as we will see",
    ", this does not mean that disorder is irrelevant for uniformly frustrated systems .",
    "in fact , the opposite is true .",
    "we find that even the smallest amounts of disorder and imperfections drive such system into a non - ergodic regime that otherwise emerges only in the presence of very strong disorder . in the language of a renormalization group flow",
    "this means that the strength of disorder , @xmath11 , flows to larger and larger values  and reaches a strong - disorder fixed point @xmath12 , even if the physical , bare disorder strength is very small .",
    "glassiness arises spontaneously even for infinitesimal extrinsic disorder , leading to _ self - generated randomness _ ,",
