    "pagerank has become a key element in the success of web search engines , allowing to rank the most important hits in the top page of results .",
    "certainly the introduction of pagerank as a factor in sorting results  @xcite has contributed considerably to google s lasting dominance in the search engine market  @xcite .",
    "but pagerank is not the only possible measure of importance or prestige among web pages .",
    "the simplest possible way to measure the prestige of a page is to count the incoming links ( in - links ) to the page .",
    "the number of in - links ( in - degree ) is the number of citations that a page receives from the other pages , so there is a correlation between in - degree and quality , especially when the in - degree is large .",
    "the in - degree of web pages is very cheap to compute and maintain , so that a search engine can easily keep in - degree updated with the evolution of the web .",
    "however , in - degree is a local measure .",
    "all links to a page are considered equal , regardless of where they come from .",
    "two pages with the same in - degree are considered equally important , even if one is cited by much more prestigious sources than the other . to modulate the prestige of a page with that of the pages pointing to it means to move from the examination of an individual node in the link graph to that of the node together with its predecessor neighbors .",
    "pagerank represents such a shift from the local measure given by in - degree toward a global measure where each web page contributes to define the importance of every other page .    from the information provider perspective , the global nature of pagerank makes it difficult or impossible to predict how a new page will be ranked . yet",
    "it is vital for many service and information providers to have good rankings by major search engines for relevant keywords , given that search engines are the primary way that internet users find and visit web sites  @xcite .",
    "this situation makes pagerank a valuable good controlled by a few major search engines .",
    "consequently a demand has emerged for companies who perform so - called _ search engine optimization _ or _",
    "search engine marketing _ on behalf of business clients .",
    "the goal is to increase the rankings of their pages , thus directing traffic to their sites  @xcite .",
    "search engine marketers have partial knowledge of how search engines rank pages .",
    "they have access to undocumented tools to measure pagerank , such as the google toolbar . through experience and empirical tests they can reverse - engineer some important ranking factors . however from inspecting the hundreds of bulletin boards and blogs maintained by search engine marketers it is evident that their work is largely guided by guesswork , trial and error .",
    "nevertheless search engine optimization has grown to be a healthy industry as illustrated by a recent study  @xcite .",
    "search engine marketing has even assumed ethical and legal ramifications as a sort of arms race has ensued between marketers who want to increase their clients rankings and search engines who want to maintain the integrity of their systems .",
    "the term _ search engine spam _ refers to those means of promoting web sites that search engines deem unethical and worthy of blocking  @xcite .",
    "the status quo described above relies on two assumptions : ( i ) pagerank is a quantitatively different and better prestige measure compared to in - degree ; and ( ii ) pagerank can not be easily guessed or approximated by in - degree .",
    "there seems to be plenty of anecdotal and indirect evidence in support of these assumptions  for example the popularity of pagerank  but little quantitative data to validate them . to wit ,",
    "amento _ et al . _",
    "@xcite report a very high average correlation between in - degree and pagerank ( spearman @xmath0 , kendall @xmath1 ) based on five queries .",
    "further , they report the same average precision at 10 ( 60% ) based on relevance assessments by human subjects . in this paper",
    "we further quantitatively explore these assumptions answering the following questions : _ what is the correlation between in - degree and pagerank across representative samples of the web ?",
    "how accurately can one approximate pagerank from local knowledge of in - degree ? _    from the definition of pagerank , other things being equal , the pagerank of a page grows with the in - degree of the page . beyond this zero - order approximation",
    ", the actual relation between pagerank and in - degree has not been thoroughly investigated in the past .",
    "it is known that the distributions of pagerank and in - degree follow an almost identical pattern  @xcite , i.e. , a curve ending with a broad tail that follows a power law with exponent about @xmath2 .",
    "this fact may indicate a strong correlation between the two variables .",
    "surprisingly there is no agreement in prior literature about the correlation between pagerank and in - degree .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite show very little correlation based on analysis of the brown domain and the trec wt10 g collection .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite report on a correlation coefficient which is basically zero based on analysis of a much larger sample ( @xmath3 pages ) taken from the webbase  @xcite collaboration . on the other hand , analysis of the university of notre dame domain by nakamura  @xcite reveals a strong correlation .",
    "in section  [ meanfield ] we estimate pagerank for a generic directed network within a mean field approach .",
    "we obtain a system of self - consistent relations for the average value of pagerank of all vertices with equal in - degree . for a network without degree - degree correlations the average pagerank turns out to be simply proportional to the in - degree , modulo an additive constant .",
    "the prediction is validated empirically in section  [ results ] , where we solve the equations numerically for four large samples of the web graph ; in each case the agreement between our theoretical estimate and the empirical data is excellent .",
    "we find that the web graph is basically uncorrelated , so the average pagerank for each degree class can be well approximated by a linear function of the in - degree . as an additional contribution",
    "we settle the issue of the correlation between pagerank and in - degree ; the linear correlation coefficient is consistently large for all four samples we have examined , in agreement with nakamura  @xcite . we also calculate the size of the fluctuations of pagerank about the average value and find that the relative fluctuations decrease as the in - degree increases , which means that our mean field estimate becomes more accurate for important pages .",
    "our results suggest that we can approximate pagerank from in - degree .",
    "by deriving pagerank with our formula we can predict the rank of a page within a hit list by knowing its in - degree and the number of hits in the list .",
    "section  [ apps ] reports on an empirical study of this prediction , performed by submitting altavista  @xcite queries to the google api  @xcite .",
    "the actual ranks turn out to be scattered about the corresponding predictions .",
    "the implication of the fact that pagerank is mostly determined by in - degree is that it is possible to estimate the number of in - links that a new page needs in order to achieve a certain rank among all pages which deal with a specific topic .",
    "this provides search marketers  and information providers  with a new powerful tool to guide their campaigns .",
    "the pagerank @xmath4 of a page @xmath5 is defined through the following expression : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total number of pages , @xmath8 indicates a hyperlink from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , @xmath10 is the out - degree of page @xmath9 and @xmath11 is the so - called damping factor .",
    "the set of equations  [ eq1 ] can be solved iteratively . from eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] it is clear that the pagerank of a page grows with the pagerank of the pages that point to it .",
    "however , the sum over predecessor neighbors implies that pagerank also increases with the in - degree of the page .",
    "pagerank can be thought of as the stationary probability of a random walk process with additional random jumps .",
    "the physical description of the process is as follows : when a random walker is in a node of the network , at the next time step with probability @xmath12 it jumps to a randomly chosen node and with probability @xmath11 it moves to one of its successors with uniform probability . in the case of directed networks",
    ", there is the possibility that the node has no successors . in this case",
    "the walker jumps to a randomly chosen node of the network with probability one .",
    "the pagerank of a node @xmath5 , @xmath4 , is then the probability to find the walker at node @xmath5 when the process has reached the steady state , a condition that is always guaranteed by the jumping probability @xmath12 .",
    "the probability to find the walker at node @xmath5 at time step @xmath13 follows a simple markovian equation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the adjacency matrix with entry @xmath16 if there is a direct connection between @xmath9 and @xmath5 and zero otherwise . the first term in eq .",
    "[ pagerank0 ] is the contribution of walkers that decide to jump to a randomly chosen node , the second term is the random walk contribution , and the third term accounts for walkers that at the previous step were located in dangling points and now jump to random nodes . in the limit",
    "@xmath17 this last contribution becomes a constant term affecting all the nodes in the same way and thus , it can be removed from eq .",
    "[ pagerank0 ] under the constraint that the final solution is properly normalized .",
    "hereafter we will use this approach .",
    "the pagerank of page @xmath5 is the steady state solution of eq .",
    "[ pagerank0 ] , @xmath18 .    equation  [ pagerank0 ] can be used as a numerical algorithm to compute pagerank but , unfortunately , it is not possible to extract analytical solutions from it . in the next subsection",
    "we propose a mean field solution of eq .",
    "[ pagerank0 ] that , nevertheless , gives a very accurate description of the pagerank structure of the web .      instead of analyzing the pagerank of single pages ,",
    "we aggregate pages in classes according to their degree @xmath19 and define the average pagerank of nodes of degree class @xmath20 as @xmath21 note that now `` degree class @xmath20 '' means all the nodes with in - degree @xmath22 and out - degree @xmath23 .",
    "taking the average of eq .",
    "[ pagerank0 ] for all nodes of the degree class @xmath20 we obtain @xmath24 from eq .  [ aveq ] we see that the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ pagerank1a ] is @xmath25 . in the right - hand side we split the sum over @xmath9 into two sums , one over all the degree classes @xmath26 and the other over all the nodes within each degree class @xmath26 .",
    "we get @xmath27 at this point we perform our mean field approximation , which consists in substituting the pagerank of the predecessor neighbors of node @xmath5 by its mean value , that is , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total number of links pointing from nodes of degree @xmath26 to nodes of degree @xmath20 . this matrix can also be rewritten as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the probability that a predecessor of a node belonging to degree class @xmath20 belongs to degree class @xmath32 . using equations  [ meanfiel ] and [ e_kk ] in eq .",
    "[ pagerank1 ]",
    "we finally obtain @xmath33 which is a closed set of equations for the average pagerank of pages in the same degree class .",
    "when the network has degree - degree correlations , the solution of this equation is non - trivial and the resulting pagerank can have a complex dependence on the degree .",
    "however , in the particular case of uncorrelated networks the transition probability @xmath31 becomes independent of the degree @xmath34 and takes the simpler form @xmath35 using this expression in eq .",
    "( [ pagerank2 ] ) and taking the limit @xmath17 , we obtain @xmath36 that is , the average pagerank of nodes of degree class @xmath20 is independent of @xmath23 and proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "the formalism presented in the previous subsection gives a solution for the average pagerank of nodes of the same degree class but it tells us nothing about how pagerank is distributed within one degree class . to fill this gap",
    ", we extend our mean field approach to the fluctuations within a degree class . to this end , we first start by taking the square of eq .",
    "[ pagerank0 ] : @xmath37 as in the previous calculation , we take the average over degree classes of the square of pagerank and define @xmath38 taking this average in eq .  [ pagerank02 ] and rearranging terms we get @xmath39 where we have used again the mean field approach .",
    "the probability @xmath40 is the joint probability that a node of degree @xmath20 has simultaneously one predecessor of degree @xmath26 and another of degree @xmath41 .",
    "we can make the further assumption that this joint distribution factorizes as @xmath42 . in this case",

    "however , for large in - degrees the relative fluctuations become less important  due to the factor @xmath22 in the denominator  and the average pagerank obtained in the previous subsection gives a good approximation .",
    "this can be seen by analyzing the coefficient of variation for the nodes with the maximum degree @xmath49 . assuming that @xmath23 is weakly correlated with @xmath22 , the coefficient @xmath50 scales with the maximum in - degree as @xmath51 and the coefficient of variation as @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath53 , the relative fluctuations go to zero .",
    "then , for small in - degrees we expect pagerank to be distributed according to a power law ; for intermediate in - degrees , according to a distribution peaked at the average mean field value plus a power law tail ; and for large in - degrees , according to a gaussian distribution centered around the predicted mean field solution .",
    "we analyzed four samples of the web graph .",
    "two of them were obtained by crawls performed in 2001 and 2003 by the webbase collaboration  @xcite .",

    "[ fig5 ] we plot the pagerank distributions for four classes , corresponding to in - degree @xmath16 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "we see that for low in - degrees ( @xmath71 ) the distribution is a power law .",
    "the exponent is essentially the same ( @xmath72 , as for the other samples ) .",
    "however , for higher degrees ( @xmath73 ) , the distribution changes from a power law to a hybrid distribution between a gaussian and a power law .",
    "the gaussian is signaled by the peak , which in the double logarithmic scale of the plot appears quite flat ; the power law is manifest in the long tail of the distribution .",
    "the power law tails are all approximately parallel to each other , i.e. , the exponent is the same for all curves .",
    "we have seen that the average pagerank of a page with in - degree @xmath22 can be well approximated by the closed formula in eq .",
    "we have also found that pagerank fluctuations about the average become less important for larger @xmath22 .",
    "these two results suggest that for large enough @xmath22 the pagerank of a page with @xmath22 in - links only depends on @xmath22 , and that eq .",

    "we want to see whether eq .  [ cleq ] can be useful in the live web .",
    "ideally we should compare the pagerank values of a list of web pages with the corresponding values derived through our formula .",
    "unfortunately the real pagerank values calculated by google are not accessible , so we need a different strategy .",
    "the simplest choice is to focus on rank rather than pagerank .",
    "we know that google ranks web pages according to their pagerank values as well as other features which do not depend on web topology .",
    "the latter features are not disclosed ; in the following we disregard them and assume for simplicity that the google ranking of a web page exclusively depends on its pagerank value .",
    "there is a simple relation between the pagerank @xmath77 of a web page and the rank @xmath78 of that page .",

    "[ rr ] ( with @xmath84 ) reproduces the data for over three orders of magnitude .",
    "the rank @xmath78 referred to above is the global rank of a page of pagerank @xmath77 , i.e. , its position in the list containing all pages of the web in decreasing order of pagerank .",
    "more interesting for information providers and search engine marketers is the rank within hit lists returned for actual queries , where only a limited number of result pages appear .",
    "we need a criterion to pass from the global rank @xmath78 to the rank @xmath85 within a query s hit list . a page with global rank",
    "@xmath78 could appear at any position @xmath86 in a list with @xmath13 hits . in our framework pages differ only by their pagerank values ( or , equivalently , by their in - degrees ) , as we neglect all semantic features .",
    "therefore we can assume that each web page has the same probability to appear in a hit list .",
    "this is a strong assumption , but even if it may fail to describe what happens at the level of an individual query , it is a fair approximation when one considers a large number of queries . under this hypothesis",
    "the probability distribution of the possible positions is a poissonian , and the expected local rank @xmath85 of a page with global rank @xmath78 is given by the mean value : @xmath87     dependence of the rank of a page on its pagerank value . ]",
    "now it is possible to test the applicability of eq .",

    "we are able to estimate the rank of a web page within a hit list if we know the number of in - links @xmath22 of the page and the number @xmath13 of hits in the list .",

    "the combination of the three steps leads to the following expression of the local rank @xmath85 as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath13 : @xmath91 the natural way to derive the parameter @xmath83 would be to perform a fit of the empirical relation between global rank and pagerank , as we did in fig .",
    "the result should then be extrapolated to the full web graph .",
    "as it turns out , the @xmath83 value derived in this way strongly depends on the sample of the web , so that one could do no better than estimating the order of magnitude of @xmath83 . on the other hand",
    "@xmath83 is a simple multiplicative constant , and its value has no effect on the dependence of the local rank @xmath85 on the variables @xmath22 and @xmath13 .",
    "therefore we decided to consider it as a free parameter , whose value is to be determined by the comparison with empirical data .    for our analysis we used a set of @xmath92 actual queries from a september 2001 altavista log  @xcite .",
    "we submitted each query to google , and picked at random one of the pages of the corresponding hit list .",
    "for each selected page , we stored its actual rank @xmath89 within the hit list , as well as its number @xmath22 of in - links , which was again determined through google .",
    "the number @xmath13 of hits of the list was also stored .",
    "google ( like other search engines ) never displays more than @xmath70 results per query , so we always have @xmath93 . from @xmath22 and @xmath13",
    "we estimated the theoretical rank @xmath88 by means of eq .",
    "[ rth ] , and compared it with its empirical counterpart @xmath89 .",
    "the comparison can be seen in the scatter plot of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . given the large number of queries and the broad range of rank values , we visualize the density of points in logarithmic bins .",
    "the region with highest density is a stripe centered on the diagonal line @xmath94 by a suitable choice of @xmath83 ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "we conclude that the rank derived through eq .",
    "[ rth ] is in most cases close to the empirical one .",
    "we stress that this result is not trivial , because ( i ) web pages are not ranked exclusively according to pagerank ; ( ii ) we are neglecting pagerank fluctuations ; and ( iii ) all pages do not have the same probability of being relevant with respect to a query .",
    "the present study motivates further enquires .",
    "the mean field approach provides a simple functional relationship between average pagerank , in - degree , and degree - degree correlations .",
    "the price one pays by using such a simple approximation is the neglect of the significant fluctuations of pagerank values around the mean field average within a degree class . for the majority of pages , having moderate pagerank , fluctuations are more important ; the in - degree being equal , they make the difference between being linked by `` good '' or `` bad '' pages . a venue",
    "we intend to pursue is to understand what makes the difference between two pages with the same in - degree and a very different value of pagerank , and how pages with higher pagerank are differently positioned in the complex architecture of the web graph .",
    "the approach described here lends itself naturally to applications other than the web , e.g. , bibliometry .",
    "commonly the quality of papers is assessed via the number of citations they receive , and it would be useful to be able to rank papers with the same number of citations through their pagerank values .",
    "a characterization of papers leading to high pagerank fluctuations would be useful in this domain as well .",
    "a promising way to study fluctuations at a moderate price in increased complexity could be to use the definition of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] where the value of pagerank on the right - hand side is substituted by the mean field approximation .",
    "further work is needed in this direction .",
    "in this paper we have quantitatively explored two key assumptions around the current search status quo , namely that pagerank is very different from in - degree due to its global nature and that pagerank can not be easily guessed or approximated without global knowledge of the web graph .",
    "we have shown that due to the weak degree - degree correlations in the web link graph , pagerank is strongly correlated with in - degree and thus the two measures provide very similar information  the pagerank factor used by search engines to rank pages can be effectively replaced by in - degree , especially for the most popular pages .",
    "further , we have introduced a general mean field approximation of pagerank that , in the specific case of the web , allows to estimate pagerank from only local knowledge of in - degree .",
    "we have further quantified the fluctuations of this approximation , gauging the reliability of the estimate .",
    "finally we have validated the approach with a simple procedure that predicts how actual web pages are ranked by google in response to actual queries , using only knowledge about in - degree and the number of query results .",
    "our method has immediate application for information providers .",
    "for instance , the association between rank and in - degree allows one to deduce how many in - links would be needed for a new page to achieve a given rank among all pages that deal with the same topic .",
    "this is an issue of crucial economic impact : all companies that advertise their products and services online wish for their homepages to belong among the top - ranked sites in their business sector .",
    "suppose that someone wants their homepage @xmath96 to appear among the top @xmath13 pages about topic @xmath97 .",
    "our recipe is extremely simple and cheap , requiring the submission of two queries to the search engine :    1 .   submit a query to google ( or another search engine ) about topic @xmath97 ; 2 .   find the number @xmath98 of in - links for the @xmath13-th page in the resulting hit list ; 3 .",
    "@xmath96 needs at least @xmath98 in - links to appear among the first @xmath13 hits for topic @xmath97 .",
    "of course there are limits to this approach ; we do not claim that the lower bound of the number of in - links can be taken as a safe guide .",
    "indeed we have neglected important factors such as the role of page content in retrieving and ranking results , and the fluctuations of the mean field approximation of pagerank .    notwithstanding the above caveats ,",
    "our results indicate that at least the order of magnitude should be a reliable reference point",
    ". this may be all that is necessary  knowing the difference between the need for one thousand or one million links can be a crucial asset in planning and budgeting a marketing campaign .",
    "is word of mouth sufficient , or is advertising required ?",
    "our approach provides a tool to answer this kind of questions . in making such a tool available to search engine marketers and information providers alike",
    ", we hope to create a more level playing field so that not only large and powerful organizations but also small communities with little or no marketing budget can make informed decisions about the management of their web presence .",
    "we thank the members of the networks and agents network at iub , especially alessandro vespignani and mariangeles serrano , for helpful discussions .",
    "we are grateful to google for extensive use of its web api , to the webbase and webgraph projects for their crawl data , and to altavista for use of their query logs .",
