    "for the non - detection sight lines , we computed a limit to @xmath8(hco@xmath0 ) using a @xmath20 upper limit to @xmath17 ( with @xmath21 in table 1 ) and assumed a line width of @xmath6 based on the j0454 - 810 detection .    from mw studies ,",
    "there is a correlation between @xmath8(hco@xmath0 ) and @xmath8(h@xmath22 ) , given by @xmath9(hco@xmath0)=@xmath8(hco@xmath0)/@xmath8(h@xmath22 ) @xmath23 ( e.g. liszt et al.2010 ) .",
    "although the correlation may be different in the lower - metallicity magellanic system , we applied this factor to @xmath8(hco@xmath0 ) to estimate the magellanic h@xmath22 column density , @xmath8(h@xmath22)@xmath24 .",
    "in addition , we extracted hi emission spectra from the stray radiation - corrected galactic all sky survey ( gass ; mcclure - griffiths et al.2009 , kalberla et al.2010 ) for each line of sight . from these data we computed @xmath8(hi)@xmath24 , assuming the hi is optically thin : @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath14 ( k ) is the hi brightness temperature integrated between radial velocities : @xmath27 .",
    "all column densities described above are included in table 2 .      using available _ planck _ maps ( version 1.20 ) and hi emission from gass , we can estimate limits to the magellanic dust reddening , h@xmath22 column density and co brightness along each line of sight .    to correct for the galactic contribution , we computed the total galactic hi column density , @xmath28 , by integrating the gass @xmath14 profile in equation 2 for all @xmath29 .",
    "we then converted this column density to an estimate of the reddening due to the mw , @xmath30 , using the results from liszt ( 2014 ) : @xmath31 , which holds for @xmath32 . to find the total reddening along the line of sight , @xmath33",
    ", we used the _",
    "planck _ model of dust radiance , or total dust emission integrated over frequency , @xmath34 .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "collaboration showed that @xmath34 is a better tracer of the total column density than @xmath35 dust optical depth in diffuse , high - latitude regions , and exhibits the strong correlation : @xmath36 ( planck collaboration et al.2014 ) .",
    "we used this correlation to compute @xmath33 , and then subtracted @xmath30 from @xmath33 to estimate the total magellanic contribution , @xmath37 .",
    "for all lines of sight , we find @xmath38 .",
    "we note that the above calculations require the assumption that the dust to gas ratio is constant across the sampled volume . using results from fuse observations of the smc and lmc",
    ", we converted @xmath37 to another estimate of @xmath39 given @xmath40 ( welty et al.2012 ) .",
    "for all lines of sight , we find @xmath41 .",
    "finally , we estimated the magellanic co brightness , @xmath42 , by assuming ( from observations of the smc ) : @xmath43 @xmath44 ( e.g. , bolatto et al.2013 ) . for all lines of sight ,",
    "we find @xmath45 .",
    "the hco@xmath0  absorption detection towards j0454 - 810 is the first of its kind in the magellanic system , and suggests the presence of molecular gas far outside of the smc and lmc . of the 8 non - detections ,",
    "only 2 were more sensitive and 6 were up to three times less sensitive due to compromised weather conditions .",
    "overall , our atca observations are more sensitive than previous searches for hco@xmath0  absorption in diffuse , high - velocity clouds .",
    "these previous studies had typical @xmath20 limits to hco@xmath0  optical depth of @xmath46 per @xmath47 channels and returned no detections ( akeson & blitz 1999 ) and one tentative and non - confirmed detection ( combes & charmandaris 2000 ) in clouds with @xmath8(hi)@xmath4 .",
    "our detected absorption line is wider ( @xmath2 ) than individual hco@xmath0  absorption lines detected in the mw ( @xmath48 ; lucas & liszt 1996 ) , and the only previously reported high - velocity cloud detection ( @xmath49 ; combes & charmandaris 2000 ) . although our measured magellanic column density , @xmath50 , is slightly smaller than the typical column densities observed in the mw ( @xmath51 ; lucas & liszt 1996 ) , it is similar to those observed in diffuse regions .",
    "for example , for the only sightline with @xmath8(hi)@xmath52 , liszt et al.(2010 ) measure @xmath53 .    in figure  [ map ]",
    "we overlay the observed hco@xmath0  absorption coordinates on an @xmath8(hi ) image of the magellanic system from the parkes radio telescope ( putman et al.2003 ) .",
    "the detection is located at the leading edge of the magellanic bridge .",
    "nearby regions contain other evidence for cold atomic and molecular gas , including hi detected in absorption with temperatures @xmath54 ( kobulnicky & dickey 1999 , matthews et al.2009 ) , and co emission close to the smc ( muller et al.2003 , mizuno et al.2006 ) .",
    "however , the detected hco@xmath0  absorption probes molecular gas farther away from the lmc and smc ( about 10 kpc from the smc s center ) than any previous radio or mm - wave studies .",
    "our estimates of @xmath8(h@xmath22)@xmath24 in table 2 ( @xmath52 ) are orders of magnitude higher than both the _ planck _ based estimates ( @xmath55 ) and those from fuse uv - absorption in the stream and bridge . towards fairall 9 , located at the beginning of the stream in a region of enhanced metallicity likely stripped from the lmc , richter et al.(2013b ) measured @xmath56 . towards an early - type star in the bridge , lehner ( 2002 ) measured @xmath57 .",
    "the discrepancies between these values and our table 2 estimates suggest that the that the mw - based conversion factor @xmath58 may not be applicable in the lower - metallicity magellanic regime . given that the @xmath59 factor is expected to be up to a factor of 100 higher in low - metallicity regimes ( e.g. , bolatto et al.2013 ) , it is likely that @xmath58 will be similarly different in the magellanic system .",
    "additional measurements of hco@xmath0  and h@xmath22 column densities are required to constrain this value further .",
    "the origin and survival of the detected hco@xmath0   in the highly diffuse ( @xmath60 ) region of the bridge is puzzling . the material either formed within the bridge , or it originated from a stripping interaction with the lmc or , more likely given its proximity , the smc .",
    "the age of the bridge is constrained to @xmath61 by the oldest detected stellar populations known to have formed in - situ ( e.g. , harris 2007 ) . within the bridge , low metallicities ( @xmath62 solar ; lehner 2008 )",
    "indicate reduced dust grain formation rates , and young stellar populations ( e.g. , demers & battinelli 1998 ) indicate potentially strong uv radiation fields ( @xmath63 mw value ) .",
    "these two properties , as discussed by lehner 2002 , imply that molecule formation and destruction equilibrium can not be reached within the bridge s lifetime for reasonable hydrogen volume densities ( e .. g , @xmath64 ; lehner 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , extremely high densities ( @xmath65 ) are likely required in the bridge for equilibrium molecule formation to occur .",
    "this was also discussed by kobulnicky & dickey ( 1999 ) in the context of cold atomic gas formation in the bridge",
    ".    however , non - equilibrium molecule formation may be responsible .",
    "simulations show that ram - pressure effects during the smc - lmc interaction which created the bridge ( required to explain the bridge s observed in - situ star formation ; e.g. , connors et al.2006 , besla 2012 ) can produce high - density , star - formation - ready peaks within the diffuse medium ( e.g. , mastropietro et al.2009 ) .",
    "further simulations of ram pressure - stripping of the ism from galaxies have shown that stars can form diffuse , gaseous tails when ablated gas cools and condenses in the turbulent wake of the stripping interaction ( e.g. , tonnesen et al.2012 ) .",
    "in the bottom panel of figure 1 we display the hi brightness temperature spectrum from gass ( mcclure - griffiths et al.2009 ) .",
    "there is an offset between the two peaks in hi and the location of hco@xmath0  absorption , which may be indicative of a shock driven by dynamical interactions and support for molecule formation in the post - shock material .    in terms of molecule survival in this environment",
    ", dust is very important , as it provides shielding against the uv radiation field and acts as a catalyst for grain formation .",
    "our _ planck_-based estimates indicate very little dust and co along the lines of sight probed by this study .",
    "a lack of shielding by dust or sufficiently large @xmath8(hi ) means that the molecular material identified by the hco@xmath0  detection must disperse quickly , and we may be observing the material in the process of being disrupted .",
    "alternatively , the detection presented here may not be tracing dense molecular gas .",
    "comprehensive studies using the plateau de bure interferometer ( e.g. , lucas & liszt 1996 , liszt et al.2010 ) have shown that strong absorption by hco@xmath0 , @xmath66co , cn , hcn , hnc and c@xmath22h can be found in surprisingly diffuse mw regions ( @xmath67 ) where fully - developed molecular chemistry is not expected to exist .",
    "herschel space observatory _ observations have detected similar molecular species to hco@xmath0 , including oh@xmath0 , in extremely diffuse gas where the fraction of h@xmath22 is @xmath68 ( indriolo et al.2015 ) .",
    "these studies indicate that many diatomic and polyatomic molecules can form and reach significant abundances even when they are not well - shielded .    in support of this scenario",
    ", there is a growing supply of evidence for the existence of molecules and star formation in hi - diffuse , dust - poor structures .",
    "for example , low-@xmath8(hi ) intermediate - velocity clouds in the mw halo exhibit ubiquitous h@xmath22 absorption ( richter et al.2003a , b ) .",
    "widespread co emission has been detected in the ram pressure - stripped tail of the norma cluster galaxy eso 137 - 001 , @xmath69 away from the disk ( jchym et al.2014 ) .",
    "in addition , young stellar associations in low - n(hi ) regions ( @xmath52 ) with high hi velocity dispersions ( @xmath70 ) have been detected in stripped tails up to @xmath71 away from ngc 1533 ( werk et al.2008 ) .",
    "overall , additional observations of molecular gas tracers at high sensitivity and in a wide range of galactic environments are needed to understand the formation and evolution of molecular gas at these extremes .",
    "absorption is a promising tracer of this material , and future observations with alma will be able to confirm the detection presented here , and extend the sample of available sources to probe the full extent of the magellanic system and the outskirts of galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "using the atca , we detected hco@xmath0  absorption in the magellanic system for the first time .",
    "we observed 9 background continuum sources , and detected one absorption line towards j0454 - 810 , with an hco@xmath0  column density of @xmath72 .",
    "the detection is located in a diffuse ( hi column density of @xmath73 ) region at the leading edge of the magellanic bridge , where there is little current evidence for either dust or co emission based on _ planck _ and",
    "gass hi observations . despite the low @xmath74",
    ", this molecular material may have formed as part of a dynamical interaction during the evolution of the bridge .",
    "ultimately , higher - sensitivity searches for hco@xmath0  absorption and other molecular gas tracers across the magellanic system are strongly needed to better understand the formation history and star formation potential of this complex , low - metallicity structure .",
