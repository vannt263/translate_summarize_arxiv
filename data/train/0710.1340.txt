    "the first tev blazar , for example , that was observed simultaneously in multiple bands from radio to tev gamma - rays is mrk  421 .",
    "the first campaign , conducted in 1994 @xcite on mrk  421 , revealed correlated variability between the kev x - ray and tev gamma - ray emission . the gamma - ray flux varied by an order of magnitude on a timescale of 2 days and the x - ray flux",

    "the high - energy gamma - ray flux observed by egret , as well as the radio and uv fluxes , showed less variability than the kev or tev bands .",

    "the uv and optical bands also showed correlation during the flares . with the detection of tev emission from mrk  501 @xcite ,",
    "several multiband campaigns were organized on mrk  501 to verify whether such a behavior is a general property of tev - emitting blazars or whether it is unique to mrk 421 .",
    "the gamma - ray blazar mkn  501 , detected as a strong tev emitter in 1995 @xcite , is one of the closest ( @xmath8 ) and brightest bl lacertae objects .",
    "historically ( i.e. , prior to 1997 ) , its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xmath9 resembles that of x - ray selected bl lac objects , having a peak in the extreme uv  soft x - ray energy band @xcite .",
    "earlier optical observations of mkn  501 have shown variations of up to @xmath10 and polarized emission up to @xmath11 @xcite .    during its active state in 1997 , where mkn  501 was monitored in the 2 - 10 kev x - ray band by the all sky monitor(asm ) on board rxte and in the tev energy band by several cherenkov telescope groups @xcite , both x - rays and tev gamma - rays increased by more than 1 order of magnitude from quiescent level @xcite .",
    "analysis of the x - ray and tev data showed , that the variations were strongly correlated between both bands , yet only marginally correlated with the optical uv band @xcite .",
    "while the synchrotron emission peaked below 0.1 kev in the quiescent state , in 1997 it peaked at  100 kev .",
    "this is the largest shift ever observed for a blazar @xcite .",
    "earlier investigations of the 1997 april flare in mkn  501 @xcite , showed that its origin may be related to a variation of @xmath12 together with an increased luminosity and a flattening of the injected electron distribution .    during the 1997 high state",
    ", the x - ray and tev light curves displayed a quasi - periodic signature @xcite .",
    "a detailed periodicity analysis , based on the tev measurements obtained with all cherenkov telescopes of the hegra - collaboration and the x - ray data with rxte , was performed by kranich et al .",
    "@xcite and more recently also by osone @xcite including utah ta data .",
    "the results indeed strongly suggest the existence of a 23 day periodicity , with a combined probability of @xmath13 in both the tev and the x - ray light curves covering the same observational period @xcite . rieger and mannheim  ( 2000 )",
    "have shown that the origin of these qpos may be related to the presence of a binary black hole in the center of mkn  501 .",
    "while this may well be possible , we explore here an alternative scenario , where the observed qpos are related to accretion disk instabilities .    in a seminal paper , shapiro et al .",
    "( 1976 ) ( sle ) have pointed out that a hot ( compton cooling - dominated ) optically thin two - temperature accretion disk may be present in the inner region of the standard optically thick disk @xcite , whenever the sle inequality @xmath14 is satisfied , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the accretion rate of the disk , @xmath18 the mass of the central black hole , and @xmath1 the viscosity parameter , constrained by the model to lie within the range @xmath19 . later work @xcite has shown that the sle configuration might be thermally unstable ( although less than the standard disk ) if the simple standard viscosity prescription is employed . however , relatively small changes in the viscosity law can already ensure a stable configuration @xcite , in particular , if stabilizing effects of a disk wind are fully taken into account .",
    "a kind of sle two - temperature disk structure may thus well exist in the inner region of bl lac type objects @xcite and provide a possible explanation for the x - ray and tev variability phenomenon in mkn  501 . for , firstly , compton processes in a inner two - temperature disk with electron temperature @xmath20 of about @xmath21 k ( and ion temperature one or two orders of magnitude higher ) can produce ( steep ) x - ray power - law spectra , in contrast to the standard disk model that can only produce emission up to the optical - uv band @xcite .",
    "secondly , analysis of the linear stability of an optically thin two - temperature disk around a compact object shows that the disk is subject to a radial pulsational instability ( inertial - acoustic mode instability ) @xcite .",
    "this possible mode of pulsational overstability , in which radial disk oscillations with local keplerian frequencies become unstable against axisymmetric perturbations , occurs if the viscosity coefficient increases sufficiently upon compression @xcite . in this case ,",
    "thermal energy generation due to viscous dissipation increases during compression , leading to amplification of the oscillations analogous to the role played by nuclear energy generation in stellar pulsations . as we demonstrate below , the occurrence of such a type of disk oscillation may well account for some quasi - periodic time variability in agns in a way similar to galactic black hole candidates @xcite .",
    "due to the lightman & eardley secular instability @xcite of the standard geometrically thin , optically thick disk model @xcite , a two - temperature disk configuration is likely to be present in the inner region of the standard disk . as shown by shapiro et al .",
    "@xcite , the outer boundary of such a two - temperature disk is determined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radius of the outer boundary , @xmath24 is the mass of the central black hole in units of @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath27 g s@xmath28yr , @xmath1 is the viscosity parameter constrained to be within the range of 0.05 to 1.0 , and @xmath29 expresses the boundary condition that the viscous stress must vanish at the inner edge of the disk .",

    "obviously , since @xmath37 is relatively insensitive to @xmath1 , the outer radius @xmath38 and the accretion rate @xmath17 can be uniquely determined , once the central black mass @xmath18 and the observed radiative output @xmath32 are known .    following shapiro et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) we assume , that a hot ( cooling - dominated ) optically thin two - temperature region forms within the inner region of the standard disk . hence , the classical outer and middle regions of the standard shakura & sunyaev ( ss ) disk model @xcite describe the outer portions of our disk model .",
    "the inner region of the cool ss disk , whose outer boundary lies at the point where the radiation pressure @xmath39 matches the gas pressure @xmath40 , extends inwards to the radius @xmath30 , where @xmath41 .",
    "the radius @xmath30 marks the outer boundary of the two - temperature inner region , which then extends inward to the innermost radius @xmath42 for a non - rotating black hole . in short ,",
    "the assumed disk configuration is assumed to be identical to the standard ss model for @xmath43 , but described by the two - temperature structure equations for @xmath44 .",
    "the disk thickness , the density , and the ratio @xmath45 for the equilibrium , two - temperature inner disk then satisfy the following equations : @xmath46    typically , the emission spectrum of a hot ( @xmath47 k ) inner disk is bremstrahlung unless a soft photon source is present , in which case the spectrum may become a power - law . in our hybrid model a fraction of the optical - uv soft photons from the outer ss disk is assumed to be intercepted by the hot sle inner disk and comptonized to form the x - ray power - law spectrum , similar as in @xcite .",
    "if comptonization is not saturated , as possible in the presence of a copious soft photon source ( such as a cold ss component ) , the soft photons will be upscattered into a power - law distribution over some energy range .",
    "the resulting disk spectrum above the input soft energy @xmath48 is approximately of the form @xmath49 where @xmath50)^{1/2}-3/2 > 0 $ ] , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 for unsaturated compton cooling , i.e. , the spectrum resembles a power - law with index @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and shows an exponential cut - off for @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding sle disk sed @xmath58 peaks at @xmath59 , i.e. , usually at around some tens of kev , with @xmath60 being higher for smaller indices .",
    "in particular , for @xmath61 kev ( @xmath62 k ) one may have @xmath63 $ ] for @xmath64 $ ] .    as first shown by kato  ( 1978 ) , accretion disks can undergo ( radial - azimuthal ) pulsational instabilities and thereby cause quasi - periodic variability .",
    "if a fluid element in the disk is perturbed from its equilibrium position , it oscillates in the radial direction with the epicyclic frequency , as the difference between gravitational and inertial ( coriolis and centrifugal ) force appears as a restoring force . due to this property",
    ", axisymmetric perturbations can propagate in the disk as inertial acoustic waves . as shown by kato",
    ", a viscous disk can be pulsationally unstable against this type of oscillations under certain conditions : by studying the stability properties of an optically thin disk to axisymmetric , local ( wavelength @xmath65 radial size of disk ) and nearly radial ( @xmath66 ) oscillations , he found that the disk becomes unstable if the coefficient of the viscosity increases sufficiently rapidly with density and temperature , and that the frequency of oscillations essentially corresponds to the angular frequency @xmath67 of the disk , independent of wavelength .",
    "more recently , wu  ( 1997 ) has studied in detail the radial pulsation instability of optically thin two - temperature accretion disks , demonstrating that in a geometrically thin , cooling - dominated two - temperature disk the acoustic o - mode ( outward - propagating ) is always unstable .",
    "it has been argued , that pulsational overstability might explain some of the qpo phenomena observed in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and galactic black hole systems @xcite , and be important for a proper understanding of periodic variability in agns @xcite .",
    "as we show in the the next section , mkn  501 may indeed represent a promising agn candidate , where pulsational overstability becomes apparent .",
    "numerical simulations of pulsational instability of geometrically thin , optically thick ( one - temperature ) @xmath1 disks show that inertial acoustic waves are excited and propagate both inwards and outwards periodically , immediately growing to shock waves and resulting in a time - varying local accretion rate exceeding the imposed input value @xmath17 by one or two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "global nonlinear calculations of such systems indeed demonstrate that ( i ) the net mass flow changes sign by a significant amount according to the direction of the oscillatory flow , although the disk seems to maintain its ability to transport on average the initially imposed @xmath17 @xcite , and that ( ii ) the oscillations also induce small relative changes in other variables ( e.g. , temperature or surface density ) @xcite . in particular , the luminosity variations caused by overstable oscillations in such systems are expected to be ( only ) at the percent level , even if local variables such a mass accretion rate and radial velocity change significantly @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , to our knowledge , no simulation of pulsational overstability for a sle type , optically thin , cooling - dominated two - temperature disk configuration has been performed up to now .",
    "this makes it difficult to draw solid ( quantitative ) conclusions for the sle case as the simulations performed so far consider physical environments quite different from that of a hot , optically thin , gas - pressure supported two - temperature accretion disk .",
    "global simulations of optically thin , two - temperature disk configurations are certainly required to remedy this problem .",
    "nevertheless , it seems very likely that significant changes in local accretion rate during an oscillatory period represent a genuine qualitative feature associated with pulsational overstability .",
    "if so , then substantial quasi - periodic changes in the total disk luminosity might be expected for the sle case ( cf .",
    "@xcite , eqs.[1 ] and [ 21 ] ) .    in principle ,",
    "the observable period of the pulsational instability in a viscous disk is of order @xcite @xmath68\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the local keplerian timescale , @xmath70 , in units of @xmath71 , is the radius at which the pulsation instability occurs , and @xmath72 is the redshift of the source . obviously , since the disk structure depends significantly on the radius , the period of the pulsational instability is different from one radius to another . yet , by using eq.(3 ) we can calculate the radius @xmath30 , at which the disk becomes unstable to radial pulsation for a given luminosity , and so derive an upper limit on the range of possible periods .",
    "in fact , these upper limits may offer a very useful guide , since numerical disk simulations suggest that the oscillations may always be trapped near the boundaries of the discs @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-ray blazar mkn 501 was the second source after mkn 421 to be detected at tev energies in 1995 by the whipple observatory @xcite . in 1997",
    "the source came into much attention when it went into a remarkable state of strong and continuous flaring activity , becoming the brightest source in the sky at tev energies @xcite .",
    "bepposax observations during a strong outburst in april 1997 showed , that the spectrum was exceptionally hard ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) over the range 0.1 - 200 kev , indicating that the x - ray power output peaked at @xmath75 kev or higher energies @xcite .",
    "these observations implied that the peak frequency has moved up by more than two orders of magnitude ( persistent over a timescale of @xmath76 d ) and that the ( apparent ) bolometric luminosity of mkn  501 has increased by a factor of @xmath77 compared to previous epochs @xcite .",

    "a comprehensive analysis of the temporal characteristics of the gamma - ray emission from mkn  501 in 1997 showed that the tev emission varied significantly on time scales of between ( 5 - 15 ) hours @xcite . if this short time variability is via inverse compton processes related to accretion disk phenomena ( see   3 )",

    "our model thus takes it that both , a direct synchrotron self compton and an external compton contribution are relevant for modelling the sed of mkn  501 , the seed photons for external compton - upscattering consisting of both , the infrared - optical seed photons from the ( quasi - steady ) ss disk component and the variable x - ray photons from the two - temperature disk component .",
    "a related , but more simpler scenario , assuming the seed photons for inverse compton scattering to be provided by a ( direct ) synchrotron plus an quasi - steady flux component comparable to the observed infrared - optical flux , has been proposed by pian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in order to account for the different degrees of sed variations of mkn  501 at x - ray and sub - x - ray energies during the april 1997 outburst ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "detailed analysis indeed suggests that one - component ssc models can not fit both the april 1997 seds and the lightcurves from x - ray to tev , and that ( at least ) an additional , moderately variable low energy component contributing in the energy range between 3 - 25 kev is required @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion seems to hold for the strong x - ray outburst observed in july 1997 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , observations in 1998 also provide evidence for an additional component in the optical regime , possible associated with the ss disk component in our hybrid disk model ( see also @xcite for an alternative interpretation ) : as shown by massaro et al .",
    "@xcite optical to x - ray data taken in june 1998 indicate that the optical spectrum is steep and does not match the low energy extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum , hence suggesting the presence of different emission components in the optical and in the x - ray regime as naturally expected in our model .",
    "monitors in both the x - rays and the tev emission show evidence for a 23-day periodicity during the 1997 high state . as demonstrated above the 23-day period in the x - ray light curve may be caused by a pulsational instability in two - temperature accretion disk , and via the inverse compton process result in the same periodicity in the tev light - curve .",
    "a pulsational instability occurring in a two - temperature disk with transition radius @xmath206 will result in a recurrence timescale of 8 to 100 days .",
    "based on the observed tev variability we have employed a characteristic black hole mass of @xmath207 in our calculations .",
    "we note that quite different central mass estimates for mkn  501 have been claimed in the literature , ranging from several times @xmath208 ( mainly based on high energy emission properties ) up to @xmath209 ( based on host galaxy observations ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , as shown by rieger & mannheim  @xcite uncertainties associated with host galaxy observations may easily lead to an overestimate of the central black hole mass in mkn  501 by a factor of three and thus reduce the implied central mass to @xmath210 , a value in fact recently confirmed by an independent analysis of central mass constraints derived from host galaxy observations @xcite . moreover , as argued by the same authors some of the apparent disagreement in central mass estimates may possibly be resolved if a binary black hole system exists in the center of mkn  501 , see also @xcite , similar as in the case of oj  287 @xcite .",
    "for example , if mkn  501 harbours a binary system with a more massive primary black hole of @xmath211 and a less massive ( jet - emitting ) secondary black hole of @xmath212 , the mass ratio @xmath213 would be of order 0.1 , which may compare well with the result @xmath214 estimated for oj  287 @xcite . while our characteristic black hole mass employed falls well within the above noted range , we note that the sle pulsational instability model may still work successfully , if a higher black hole mass is used .",
    "for example , if one adopts @xmath215 and @xmath155 days , one obtains @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "our analysis is based on a specific disk model ( sle ) which is open to questions , in particular with respect to its possible stability properties .",
    "we note however , that a relatively small change in the usually employed viscosity description may already lead to a thermally stable configuration @xcite . on the other hand , it may as well be possible that the sle configuration represents a quasi - transient phenomenon associated with those changes in accretion history that probably initiate the high states .",
    "an alternative ( inner ) disk configuration of interest may be represented by an optically thin two - temperature adaf solution @xcite . such a configuration can exist for accretion rates @xmath219 below a critical rate @xmath220 , where the canonical adaf value of @xmath221 has been employed @xcite .",
    "adafs are generally less luminous than a standard disk , with the typical adaf luminosity given by @xmath222 @xcite . using the constraints above",
    ", the possible adaf luminosity for mkn  501 becomes @xmath223 erg / s , which is already about an order of magnitude smaller than required by the x - ray analysis .",
    "this suggests that  at least during its high state  an optically thin adaf is not a viable option for mkn  501 .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( 7 ) we can estimate the variation rate of the period due to the motion of the instability @xmath224 using @xmath225 , @xmath226 and eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , one finds @xmath227 for @xmath1 = 0.28 the relevant parameters result in @xmath228 . from the period analysis performed by kranich et al .",
    "@xcite a @xmath229 deviation in period corresponds to 6.67 days .",
    "if we take this deviation as the intrinsic variation on the periodicity ( p ) , then a @xmath230 of @xmath231 can be estimated from the results by kranich et al .  @xcite .",
    "as this estimate assumes that the deviation of the period is only affected by the motion of the instability , while it may in fact be caused by more than one effect , our theoretical @xmath230 should not be greater than the observational results .",
    "we conclude that the observed 23-day qpos in mkn  501 might be caused by the instability of a two - temperature accretion disk .",
    "the model presented here may thus offers an alternative explanation to the binary - driven helical jet model of rieger & mannheim  ( 2000 ) .",
    "comprehensive computational modelling of the pulsational instability in a two - temperature , cooling dominated disk will be essential to verify this in more detail .",
    "our model predicts that a period correlation in the x - ray and @xmath7-ray should always be present during an active source stage , while the period of the qpos may vary as the instability region could change from one high state to the other .",
