    "the study of iron - based high critical temperature superconductors continues attracting the attention of the condensed matter community  @xcite .",
    "originally these materials were widely perceived as being in the weakly correlated regime , where fermi surface nesting effects dominate ; however , in recent times evidence has begun to accumulate indicating that the effects of electronic correlations can not be neglected .",
    "this is manifested by substantial bandwidth reductions , the detection of localized spins at room temperature , and by the presence of superconductivity in cases with only electron pockets at the fermi surface  @xcite . for these reasons , and since the iron pnictides and chalcogenides have several active @xmath0 orbitals , it is very important to study multiorbital hubbard models at intermediate hubbard couplings @xmath1 using reliable unbiased many - body techniques .",
    "there is , however , a notorious lack of appropriate computational methodologies for these demanding studies .",
    "in fact , the analysis of multiorbital hubbard models at arbitrary couplings and temperatures is developing into a grand challenge for theoretical / computational physics .    in this publication",
    ", we present a systematic investigation of the properties of a recently introduced one - dimensional three - orbital hubbard model  @xcite , using multiple techniques including constrained - path quantum monte carlo ( cpqmc ) , determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) , and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "our conclusion is that cpqmc , when applied in the systematic manner described here , reproduces well the previously published dmrg results . as a consequence",
    ", cpqmc can address problems in higher dimensions , since this approach is not affected by the sign problem .",
    "we also have observed that a simplified hubbard model , where the pair - hopping term has been discarded and the hund interaction is reduced to its ising component , leads to phase diagrams that are very similar to those of the full model .",
    "this simplification improves the performance of dqmc and other quantum monte carlo methods , since it alleviates the sign problem .",
    "our main focus is on the so - called orbital - selective mott phase ( osmp ) , a state widely discussed in multiorbital systems  @xcite . to focus on this state",
    ", our study will be mainly in the regime of robust hund coupling strength that is compatible with a variety of investigations for iron - based superconductors  @xcite . in the osmp",
    ", the occupation of one or more of the orbitals locks to one electron per orbital with increasing @xmath2 ( @xmath1 is the on - site hubbard repulsion and @xmath3 is the electronic bandwidth ) , while the remaining orbitals have a fractional filling . for these reasons ,",
    "this state has an intriguing combination of spin localized and charge itinerant degrees of freedom , as shown in several experiments on the iron based superconductors  @xcite . since the osmp is also of potential value in several other correlated multiorbital systems ,",
    "our investigations are of relevance beyond the realm of the iron - based superconductors .",
    "the importance and richness of the osmp regime is exemplified by the recent discovery of block states in previous dmrg studies of the one - dimensional three - orbital hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "block states are formed by a small number of spins ( the `` block '' ) that align ferromagnetically within the block , and with an antiferromagnetic coupling between blocks .",
    "these states have been reported in experimental and theoretical studies of two - leg ladder selenides belonging to the iron superconductors family  @xcite , and it is intriguing to speculate on their possible existence in higher dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent investigations  @xcite unveiled the presence of three types of osmp regimes , each differing with respect to the number of orbitals occupied by an integer number of electrons .",
    "these three osmp phases are classified as follows : osmp1 is the most canonical one , where one orbital s filling is locked to one electron per orbital , while the remaining two orbitals have fractional populations ; osmp2 appears for total electronic densities @xmath4 between 3 and 4 , and has two orbitals whose occupations are locked to one electron each , while the third orbital has a fractional filling ; finally , osmp3 was found for total fillings @xmath4 between 4 and 5 , and has one orbital locked with one electron , a second orbital locked with two electrons , and the third orbital has a fractional filling .",
    "for completeness , at small @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the strength of the hund s coupling ) , a band insulator ( bi ) phase was also reported  @xcite , with two orbitals doubly occupied and one orbital empty .",
    "a related bi and metallic phase ( bi+m ) also occurs , where two orbitals are close to being doubly occupied and the other one is almost empty .",
    "it is important to make sure whether these phases can be reached by cpqmc and dqmc as well .",
    "the organization of this publication is as follows : the two models are defined in sec .",
    "[ models ] and the technical details of our computational methods , particularly cpqmc and dqmc , are described in sec .",
    "[ method ] .",
    "section  [ results ] contains our main results , and finally in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] we provide further discussion and present our conclusions .",
    "as already explained , we will focus on the one - dimensional three - orbital hubbard model previously proposed and studied with the dmrg technique in refs .   and .",
    "this model displays a robust osmp regime in the phase diagram and hence it resembles qualitatively the physics expected to develop in realistic multiorbital models for the iron - based superconductors and related systems .",
    "in addition , the use of models that were previously analyzed computationally facilitates the comparison between our results and previous literature .",
    "the model is composed of tight - binding and coulombic interaction ( restricted to be on site ) terms : @xmath7 .",
    "the tight - binding component is    @xmath8    where the operator @xmath9 @xmath10 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath11-axis projection @xmath12 at orbital @xmath13 @xmath14 on lattice site @xmath15 .",
    "the number operator is @xmath16 .",
    "the hopping amplitudes @xmath17 defined in orbital space connect the lattice sites @xmath15 and @xmath18 , with the specific values ( ev units ) @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , as schematically illustrated in fig .  [ hopping ] .",
    "the total bandwidth is @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the orbital - dependent crystal - field splitting is denoted by @xmath24 , where we set @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , following refs .  .",
    "the band structure of this model roughly resembles that of iron - based superconductors because it has hole and electron pockets centered at wavevectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "( with @xmath30 ) at two lattice sites @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the dashed black lines are the hoppings . here",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 correspond to the intra - orbital nearest - neighbor hoppings , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the inter - orbital hoppings . ]",
    "the interacting portion of the hamiltonian is given by the usual electronic multiorbital terms and is defined as @xmath38    here , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 represents the pauli matrices ) is the total spin operator at orbital @xmath13 on lattice site @xmath15 , @xmath41 is the electronic density , and @xmath42 .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "[ hint1 ] describe the intra- and inter - orbital coulomb repulsion on the same lattice site , respectively .",
    "the third term contains the hund coupling that favors the ferromagnetic alignment of the spins in different orbitals of the same lattice site .",
    "the pair - hopping is the fourth term and its coupling strength is equal to @xmath6 .",
    "note that @xmath43 satisfies the constraint @xmath44 , due to the orbital rotational invariance  @xcite .",
    "the model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ hk ] ) and  ( [ hint1 ] ) will be referred to as the `` full '' model in this publication .",
    "we have also studied a `` simplified '' model with the same hopping terms but neglecting the spin - flip portion of the hund s interaction ( i.e. only the ising contribution was used ) as well as the pair - hopping interaction in eq .",
    "( [ hint1 ] ) . in doing so",
    ", we analyze the extent to which these terms affect the phase diagrams of the full model .",
    "limited influences would be important for the state - of - art computational techniques since these terms are often cumbersome to implement and , more importantly , it can pave the way to simulations under more realistic circumstances , such as on ladder or two - dimensional geometries .",
    "the corresponding interactions of the simplified model are @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath11-component of the spin operator @xmath47 .",
    "we studied the full and simplified models numerically by using three powerful techniques : dmrg  @xcite , dqmc  @xcite , and cpqmc  @xcite .",
    "each of these techniques has its strengths and weaknesses .",
    "dmrg is widely recognized as the best technique for quasi one - dimensional systems although it is difficult to apply in higher dimensions .",
    "dqmc can be extended to higher dimensions but it suffers the infamous fermion sign problem , even in one dimension  @xcite . finally , cpqmc does not have sign problems and can be used in any dimension , but the results depend on the trial wave function in some cases , as explained below . since the cpqmc method has not received as much attention as the other two approaches mentioned here , it will be tested more extensively in the present study  @xcite .",
    "we now proceed with several goals in mind .",
    "first , we will test the cpqmc method in various three - orbital hubbard model settings .",
    "we simulated the one - dimensional systems employing open boundary conditions ( obc ) to facilitate a comparison with dmrg , which is known to work better under these boundary conditions .",
    "( in principle the performance of cpqmc is not expected to degrade with periodic boundary conditions . )",
    "second , we wish to explore the effect of pair - hopping and spin - flip interactions by comparing the full and simplified models .",
    "third , we wish to examine the extent of the sign problem when dqmc is applied to the simplified model .",
    "surprisingly , we found that the sign problem is present but relatively mild .",
    "finally , small discrepancies among the three techniques , especially for dmrg and cpqmc methods , will be discussed .",
    "since we are not modifying the standard dmrg protocol , here we will only describe in detail the cpqmc methodology , and , very briefly , the dqmc method . for more details about cpqmc and its applications to other multiorbital hubbard models , we refer the reader to refs .   and references therein .    with regards to dmrg , typically 300 states per block were kept in the iterations and up to 25 sweeps were performed during the finite - size algorithm evolution ( in some cases up to 600 states were used and up to 37 sweeps were done ) .",
    "truncation errors were of the order of @xmath48 .",
    "for each point in the phase diagram shown below , dmrg was run in the subspaces with zero and maximum total @xmath11-axis spin projections , and their energies were contrasted to address possible ferromagnetism ( we observed that the ground states are all in either one or the other of those two total @xmath11-axis spin projections subspaces ) .",
    "typical dmrg simulation times vary with the coupling strength @xmath1 and electron doping @xmath4 .",
    "for example , the @xmath49 system requires @xmath50 h for one point in the phase diagram , using 24 processors parallely .",
    "the cpqmc method is a sign - problem - free auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo method , which projects out the ground state from a trial state by branching random walks in the slater determinant space .",
    "a constrained - path approximation is needed in the cpqmc algorithm to prevent the sign problem  @xcite .",
    "applications of cpqmc on various models and geometries yielded accurate results  @xcite .    in the cpqmc method , the ground state @xmath51 is obtained by iteratively applying the projector operator @xmath52 to a trial state @xmath53 , with @xmath54 . in order to implement the monte carlo steps ,",
    "the projector @xmath52 is transformed into a summation of one - body operators , @xmath55 , by using the hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation  @xcite and suzuki - trotter decomposition . here",
    ", @xmath56 is a set of ising - like auxiliary fields introduced in the hs transformation .",
    "@xmath56 can be interpreted as random variables distributed according to the probability distribution function @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is an @xmath56-dependent one - body operator .",
    "the procedure to transform the most complicated interactions , such as the hund s coupling and pair - hopping terms , into one - body operators can be found in the appendix  @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo sampling of the set @xmath56 can be carried out according to @xmath57 , propagating the wave - function , written as a slater determinant @xmath59 , to a new one @xmath60 via @xmath61 , with @xmath62 .",
    "the procedure , @xmath63 , is usually regarded as open - ended branching random walks in the slater determinant space .    in general ,",
    "thousands of random walkers are employed in the cpqmc simulation .",
    "because of the linearity of the schrdinger equation , the random walks will naturally produce two sets of degenerate and mutually - canceling solutions , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . as a linear combination of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the calculated ground state is basically dominated by the monte carlo noise .",
    "to control this problem , the random walks are constrained in cpqmc such that the condition @xmath66 , which is also called the constrained - path approximation  @xcite , is fulfilled at each monte carlo step .",
    "after the random walks have equilibrated , expectation values can be estimated from the calculated ground state @xmath67 , which is a linear combination of random walkers with different weight factors . in principle , any observable @xmath68 could be evaluated by using @xmath69 however , such a `` brute - force '' way usually induces large fluctuations because in such a procedure @xmath70 contains many overlapping terms among different walkers , where each walker was propagated independently and without any knowledge of others .",
    "it is hard to reduce the statistical error by increasing the number of walkers @xmath71 , since the error scales as @xmath72 . for observables",
    "@xmath68 that commute with the hamiltonian @xmath73 , an easy to implement and time - saving mixed estimator , @xmath74 usually gives high accuracy results .",
    "one can simply prove the accuracy of mixed estimator as follows , @xmath75 where @xmath76 when @xmath77 is large . because all the walkers originated from the initial state @xmath53 , mixed estimators have very small fluctuations .",
    "for the observables @xmath68 that do not commute with @xmath73 , it is sometimes possible to improve the mixed estimator by a linear extrapolation  @xcite , @xmath78 another widely used estimator involves the back - propagation ( bp )  @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is typically in the range of 20 to 40 .",
    "bp provides accurate estimates of ground - state properties in the hubbard model  @xcite , and also shows a high degree of accuracy for the simplified model in our simulations . for the full model",
    ", however , our calculations suggest that bp can only work for a limited parameter regime , say @xmath81 ; beyond this parameter regime bp always produces unacceptably large statistical errors . to explore the whole phase diagram here",
    ", we used the extrapolation method in eq .",
    "( [ ex ] ) to estimate observables that do not commute with @xmath73 for the full model while bp was used for the simplified model .",
    "we tested the results of the bp and extrapolation methods on the simplified model , and both methods predicted the same physics , i.e. the calculated energies of bp and extrapolation schemes are consistent as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . for this reason",
    ", we believe the extrapolation results capture the correct physics in the full model .    ) using @xmath49 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and the cpqmc method . shown is the energy per site obtained both by back propagation ( bp ) and by extrapolation ( extr ) schemes .",
    "the agreement is clearly excellent .",
    "( b ) the relative energies ( with @xmath84 as unit of reference ) of the simplified model obtained from the cpqmc method .",
    "results are shown for various trial states and reported with respect to the energy of the block state with the spin configuration @xmath85 , at @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and using an @xmath49 system .",
    "fm and afm are ferromagnetic and staggered antiferromagnetic states , respectively .",
    "b , b2 , and b1 represent the block states with the spin configurations @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , respectively . ]    based on the above discussion , together with the analysis of our simulation data , we conclude that the quality of the cpqmc calculation may depend on the trial wave function @xmath53 to a certain extent : the trial state @xmath53 always plays an important role , both in the constrained - path approximation and in the observable estimate . in order to get more accurate results and faster convergence speed ,",
    "our cpqmc simulations were divided into three steps :    1 .",
    "use the hartree - fock ( hf ) technique to construct a set of trial states with different magnetic orders ; 2 .   use each of these hf states to carry out a set of independent cpqmc simulations ; 3 .   obtain the final ground state from the completed cpqmc calculations by selecting the state with the lowest energy  @xcite .    following this strategy ,",
    "each data point shown below ( corresponding to a specific set of parameters @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and @xmath4 ) requires dozens of cpqmc simulations .",
    "the underlying reason for such massive efforts is that , in our three - orbital cpqmc calculations , different trial states often converge to different solutions each lying very close to one another in energy .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ]  ( b ) exemplifies a typical situation we observed : states with different magnetic orders are reached after starting from very different trial states , but sometimes their energies are so close that the system could be characterized to display the incorrect magnetic order .",
    "this may be different from the cpqmc calculations in the single - orbital models where the simulations seem to be insensitive to the trial wave function  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we found that the system was hard to converge to the ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase in the cpqmc calculation if it was initially starting from the @xmath89 sector . to properly study the fm candidate ,",
    "apart from the simulations in @xmath89 , we also forced the system to start from the highest-@xmath90 at a given filling .",
    "for instance , for two - thirds total filling ( on average four electrons per site ) on an @xmath91-site system , we set the number of electrons with up- and down - spin to be @xmath92 and @xmath91 , respectively , when searching for possible fm phases .    in a typical large - scale cpqmc simulation",
    ", we set the average number of random walkers to be 4800 and the time step is fixed at @xmath93 .",
    "for each walker , 2000 monte carlo steps were sampled before measurements were performed , and 20 blocks of 480 monte carlo steps each were used to ensure statistical independence during the measurements .",
    "closed - shell fillings were employed in the simulations . to judge the accuracy of the cpqmc method , we compared the cpqmc energies against those employing the lanczos method on a small @xmath94 system and also dmrg method on an @xmath49 system : the maximum energy difference is within @xmath95 up to @xmath96 .",
    "( color online ) dqmc results for the average value of the fermion sign for the simplified model .",
    "results are shown for average fillings @xmath97 ( red @xmath98 ) and 4.0 ( green @xmath99 ) , and at an inverse temperature of @xmath100 . ]    finally , note that because of the large computational time required for each set of parameters , mpi parallelism  @xcite was integrated into the cpqmc algorithm . in the monte carlo procedure @xmath63 , each random walker @xmath59",
    "is independently propagated by @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to implement such a procedure in parallel by distributing the random walkers over multiple processors .",
    "the average observables for each processor were collected and averaged when necessary .",
    "this method was found to scale almost linearly .",
    "for instance , 4800 random walkers can be distributed evenly among 24 processors , and the computational time for one of these cpqmc simulations is approximately 2 hours .",
    "this can then be compared to the nearly 2 days of computational time when using only a single intel xeon e5 - 2680v3 core of the same type .",
    "dqmc is a numerically exact auxiliary - field method , capable of handling the hubbard interactions non - perturbatively .",
    "the method  @xcite , and its extension to multiorbital systems with inter - orbital density - density interactions relevant for this publication , can be found in refs . and .",
    "we refer the reader to these papers and references therein for further details .",
    "the bottleneck of dqmc is the fermion sign problem  @xcite , which limits the range of accessible temperatures in many models .",
    "generally speaking , severe fermion sign problems would occur in the dqmc simulations of the multiorbital models with inter - orbital hubbard and hund s interactions and , worse , the severity of the problem increases when the off diagonal terms of the interaction are included  @xcite .",
    "a recent study  @xcite , however , has found that the sign problem in the single - band hubbard model depends strongly on the geometry of the system .",
    "similarly , it turns out that the simplified model [ see eq .",
    "( [ hint2 ] ) ] has a manageable sign problem on the one dimensional lattice considered here .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sign ] , where we plot the average sign value as a function of @xmath1 while holding @xmath101 fixed . here , results are shown for an @xmath102 chain and at an inverse temperature of @xmath100 , which is lower than temperatures that can be usually reached in the analogous two - dimensional model .",
    "one can see that the average value of the sign is quite high for most values of @xmath1 , indicating that low temperature properties can be accessed .",
