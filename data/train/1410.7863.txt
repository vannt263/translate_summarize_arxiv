    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are generally believed to consist of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) surrounded by dense material ( i.e. , molecular gas and dust ) in a disk or a torus configuration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "m51 hosts a seyfert 2 nucleus @xcite with a pair of radio jets @xcite .",
    "it is located at a distance of 7.1 mpc @xcite , which is about one half that of ngc 1068 ( 14.4 mpc ; * ? ? ?",

    "the molecular gas distribution and kinematics within @xmath0 ( @xmath1 pc ) from the agn are complex , showing no clear evidence for a disk or torus , but instead two separated features located at the eastern and western sides of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the western clump shows a velocity gradient along the radio jets , and its value matches well with that of the ionized gas along the jets @xcite , strongly indicating that the western clump is entrained by the jets and outflowing from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "these previous @xmath0 resolution studies , however , have only been done with co lines , which might trace different gas components , including diffuse molecular gas , and may confuse our view of the gas distribution and kinematics close to the nucleus . on the other hand ,",

    "we then convolved all the images to the largest beam size among our data of @xmath18 with the position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath19 .",
    "we note here that this @xmath15 range matching does not significantly change the images from the @xmath15 unlimited ones .",
    "we did not match the @xmath15 range for the co(2  1 ) data , since there is a small overlap in the @xmath15 range with other data ( i.e. , co j = 2  1 data has the shortest @xmath15 length twice longer than that of j = 1  0 data , since those data are taken simultaneously with pdbi ) .",
    "as we will show , the co(2  1 ) line traces the same features , and is shown for reference , although it is not included in the line ratio calculations .",
    "in fig .  [ fig - mom0 ] , we show the central @xmath20 ( @xmath21 pc ) region integrated intensity maps of the co(1  0 ) , co(2  1 ) , co(3  2 ) , and hcn(1  0 ) lines .",
    "all the data except co(2  1 ) are @xmath15 and beam matched images as mentioned above .",
    "the spatial resolution in co(2  1 ) is more than a factor of two higher than other images @xcite , and is shown here for reference .",
    "all the images appear to have similar overall molecular gas distributions and kinematics : there are two clumps located at the western and eastern sides of the nucleus ( hereafter clumps s1 and s2 , respectively ; see fig .",
    "[ fig - mom0]a ) , whereby the western clumps s1 are elongated along the north - south direction .",
    "the intensity - weighted velocity maps for all the lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - mom1 ] . in all the maps ,",
    "the eastern clump s2 shows increasingly higher blueshifted velocities toward the nucleus , and the western clump s1 shows clear velocity gradient in the north - south direction , as was previously reported by @xcite .",
    "the similarity in the kinematics for all the lines suggests that the overall molecular gas distribution and kinematics at the central @xmath20 does not depend on the molecular species ( both co and hcn ) or properties ( both diffuse and dense gas , and from lower - j to higher - j lines ) . as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , the s1 clump is the jet - entrained molecular gas , so that the similarity of the distribution and kinematics between the co and hcn data strongly indicates that _ the both diffuse and dense molecular gas is entrained by the jets and outflowing from the agn . _    with a detailed inspection of the channel maps , however , a distinct difference between the co and hcn distributions can be seen in a channel map at the systemic velocity ( @xmath22 km s@xmath12 * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig - ch480kms ] displays three channel maps centered at the velocity of 460 , 480 , and 500 km s@xmath12 , each with a width of @xmath14 km s@xmath12 . in the channel maps at the velocity of 460 and 500 km s@xmath12 ( i.e. , adjacent to the channel at the systemic velocity ) ,",
    "all the lines show the emission peaks at either or both eastern and western sides of the nucleus ( some emissions elongate toward the nucleus , but do not peak there ) . on the other hand ,",
    "in the channel maps at the velocity of 480 km s@xmath12 , which includes the systemic velocity of @xmath22 km s@xmath12 , _ the hcn(1  0 ) line clearly exhibits a @xmath23 peak at the nucleus , where co lines show no peak if any detectable emission at the nucleus_. to further confirm this systemic velocity hcn emission peak , we plot the spectra toward the nucleus of m51 for all four lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - spec ] . as can be seen , all the co lines exhibit at best emission at the @xmath24 level , but the hcn(1  0 ) line shows a @xmath23 peak only at the systemic velocity channel of 480 km s@xmath12 .",
    "this therefore indicates that _ the central hcn(1  0 ) emission is highly related to the molecular gas around the systemic velocity_.    after converting the integrated intensity maps of the co(1  0 ) and hcn(1  0 ) lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - mom0 ] into brightness temperature maps , we made the hcn(1  0)/co(1  0 ) brightness temperature ratio map in fig .",
    "[ fig - ratiomap ] overlaid on the vla 6 cm continuum map @xcite .",
    "all the molecular gas clumps show the hcn / co ratios of more than 0.1 , and the clumps closer in projection either to the agn or to the jet tend to have higher ratios .",
    "indeed , the highest ratio of more than 2.0 is located at the agn ( western ) side of the clump s2 .",
    "more interestingly , _ all the eastern side of the clump s1 has higher ratio of @xmath25 than the western side of @xmath26 , and this side is where the radio jets are running through _ , which can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - ratiomap ] .    the average ratios of the clumps s1 , s2 , and s3 are calculated as 0.6 , 1.5 , and 0.3 , respectively . on the other hand , since the co(1  0 ) emission totally lacks at the nucleus ( see fig .  [",
    "fig - mom0]a ) , the hcn / co ratio at the nucleus can not be calculated in the ratio map .",
    "but since the hcn(1  0 ) emission does exist at the nucleus with the integrated intensity of 0.422 jy beam@xmath12 km s@xmath12 , the lower limit of the hcn / co brightness temperature ratio at the nucleus can be calculated as @xmath27 using the @xmath13 upper limit of co of 0.744 jy beam@xmath12 km s@xmath12 .",
    "this is also true in the channel map at the velocity of 480 km s@xmath12 ; in fig .",

    "[ fig - iring](b ) .",

    "our high spatial resolution molecular gas images toward the seyfert 2 nucleus of m51 clearly exhibit higher hcn(1  0)/co(1  0 ) ratios in the molecular gas clumps located close to the agn than those in other galaxies ; the jet - entrained molecular gas clump ( clump s1 ; projected distance of @xmath31 pc from the nucleus ) has an averaged hcn / co ratio of 0.6 , and the nearest clump from the agn ( clump s2 ; projected distance @xmath32 pc ) a ratio of 1.5 .",

    "based on these values , the averaged hcn / co ratio of the clump s1 is similar to those of other seyfert galaxies , and that of the clump s3 is at the high end of normal or starburst galaxies .",

    "@xcite observed a highly collimated outflow in the dark cloud l1157 with the @xmath36co(1  0 ) , @xmath37co(1  0 ) , and hcn(1  0 ) lines . in their @xmath36co spectrum ,",
    "two ( narrow and broad ) components can be seen , which are tracing quiescent and outflowing gas , respectively . in the @xmath37co spectrum",

    "we integrate all the hyperfine components of the hcn line , since our m51 data can not distinguish these lines . from these data , we calculated the hcn/@xmath36co and hcn/@xmath37co ratios for the outflowing ( shocked ) gas as 0.9 and @xmath38 ( using @xmath13 upper limit for the @xmath37co data ) , respectively .",
    "interferometric hcn and @xmath36co line observations of the orion - kl high velocity outflow @xcite also show high hcn/@xmath36co ratios ranging between @xmath39 .",
    "the ratios in the orion - kl outflow is lower than that in the l1157 outflow , possibly due to more complex nature ( and therefore larger contamination ) in the massive star forming regions than in the low mass star forming regions .",
    "the ratio and the condition of the clump s1 , especially the side close to the radio jets , is very similar to that of the outflowing ( shocked ) molecular gas in l1157 .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that the high hcn / co ratio along the radio jets in m51 is caused by the strong interaction ( i.e. , shock ) between the jets and the outflowing molecular gas .",
    "furthermore , it is worth mentioning that the averaged hcn / co ratio of 0.6 is very similar to the dense molecular gas outflow observed toward mrk 231 of @xmath35 @xcite . since their spatial resolution of @xmath40 kpc is lower than ours , it is possible that the actual hcn / co ratio in mrk 231 is higher .",
    "the clump s2 shows extremely high hcn / co ratio of 1.5 on average , and more than 2 at the nucleus as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - iring ] . as mentioned above , such high ratios",
    "have not been observed in extragalactic molecular gas , but observed in molecular gas around asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "we observed the high mass - loss carbon agb stars , irc@xmath41 , with @xmath36co(1  0 ) , @xmath37co(1  0 ) , and hcn(1  0 ) for the intensity calibrations of our past observations ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the resultant @xmath36co/@xmath37co , hcn/@xmath36co , and hcn/@xmath37co integrated intensity ratios are @xmath42 , 1.3 , and 15 , respectively . note again that we integrate all the hcn hyperfine lines for this calculation .",
    "the high hcn/@xmath36co and hcn/@xmath37co ratios are due to the infrared ( ir ) pumping @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the extremely high hcn / co ratio can be due to the ir pumping . in the following subsections , we discuss what is the possible excitation mechanism for the clump s2 .",
    "we start by assuming that both molecules are excited solely by collisions with h@xmath43 molecules , which is typically the case in galactic gmcs .",
    "the opacity ratio under the local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) can be expressed as @xmath44}{\\rm [ co ] }         \\nonumber \\\\   &    & \\times \\frac{1-\\exp(-h\\nu_{\\rm hcn(1 - 0)}/kt ) }                     { 1-\\exp(-h\\nu_{\\rm co(1 - 0)}/kt)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the filling factor , @xmath46 is the dipole moment , @xmath47 is the rotational constant , @xmath48 is the planck constant , @xmath49 is the rotational transition frequency , and @xmath50 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the hcn and co molecular abundances relative to h@xmath43 are expressed as [ hcn ] and [ co ] , respectively . adopting @xmath51 , which is already an extreme case compared to the galactic gmcs where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ghz , @xmath56 ghz , @xmath57 ghz , @xmath58 ghz , [ hcn ] @xmath59 @xcite , and [ co ] @xmath60 , the opacity ratio can be calculated as @xmath61 under a large range of molecular gas temperature condition ( @xmath62 k ) .",
    "the brightness temperature ratio can therefore be expressed as @xmath63 and this ratio ranges between 0.18 ( optically thin limit ) and 1 ( optically thick limit ) , which can not realize hcn(1  0)/co(1  0 ) @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath65 is @xmath4 times larger than @xmath66 , then it is possible to obtain the observed ratio , but it is physically unlikely ; the critical density of the hcn molecule is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of the co molecule , so that wherever the hcn molecules can emit , the co molecules can also emit , and @xmath65 can not be larger than @xmath66 . a simple way to reproduce the observed hcn / co ratio would be if the [ hcn]/[co ] abundance ratio is increased by a factor of @xmath4 . in either case , the co emission should be optically thin .",
    "this is also true even for the non - lte radiation transfer modeling using the large - velocity - gradient ( lvg ) approximation ; without changing the hcn abundance , the hcn / co ratio can be at most around unity under very limited temperature or density range ( see sect .",
    "[ sect - dis - irpump ] below and fig .",
    "[ fig - irp]c ) .",
    "in addition to the collisional excitation , here we also consider the possibility of ir radiative pumping @xcite , since this mechanism can enhance the hcn intensity as mentioned for the case of irc@xmath41 in sect .",
    "[ sect - dis - s2 ] .",
    "this mechanism is to pump the population of a rotational level to higher levels via vibrational transitions ; in a strong ir radiation field , some molecules that have vibrational transitions at ir wavelength will be pumped to higher _ vibrational _ levels and radiate back to lower levels , but to higher _ rotational _ levels than before .",
    "this process increases the population at higher rotational levels and therefore makes the rotational transition emission stronger than general molecular clouds ( no strong ir field ) , which only have collisional pumping .",
    "this is particularly relevant when a luminous source is present ( e.g. , agn ) in the background , such that optical / uv radiation is absorbed by dust and reradiated in ir .",
    "the vibrational transition of hcn molecule is at @xmath67 m , where the radiation from warm dust irradiated by agns is strong , and therefore this is one of the possible mechanisms to explain the high hcn / co ratio toward agns .",

    "recent interferometric observations toward those galaxies have indeed displayed vibrationally excited hcn lines toward their ir luminous nuclei @xcite .    to check",
    "whether ir pumping of hcn can occur near the nucleus , we need to estimate the radiative excitation in this region .",

    "0)/co(1  0 ) ratio of @xmath2 can be obtained at dense condition ( @xmath100  @xmath6 ) . on the other hand , when including infrared pumping , hcn(1  0)/co(1  0 ) @xmath2 can also be obtained even at low density condition , namely it is possible at large density range .    * note that with the h@xmath43 column density per velocity we used , the co brightness temperatures , especially j = 1  0 , are much lower than the assumed molecular gas temperature of 100 k , since co is already thermalized and the population is at higher - j transitions , which makes the lower - j lines optically thin and therefore low brightness temperatures .",
    "this is consistent with the non - detection of the co lines toward the nucleus under the current noise level of @xmath101 k at @xmath13 upper limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - ch480kms ] ) and the detection of the hcn(1  0 ) line . *    in summary , infrared pumping",
    "does not need to be invoked to realize high hcn(1 ",
    "0)/co(1  0 ) ratio of @xmath2 , but with infrared pumping , it is easier to realize .",
    "since this is not conclusive only with the lvg calculations , we discuss the possibility of infrared pumping with other observational results in the next subsection .      based on the radiative transfer calculations above , it is necessary to have high hcn abundance to realize high hcn(1  0)/co(1",
    " 0 ) ratio .",
    "there are several ways in which the hcn abundance may be enhanced .",
    "one possibility is due to high x - ray radiation from agns .",
    "since x - ray radiation penetrates much deeper and denser regions than uv radiation , the chemical reactions exhibits different pathways compared with photo - dissociated region ( pdr ) .",
    "the molecular gas region that is irradiated by x - ray is called x - ray dominated region ( xdr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and some radiative transfer calculations of xdr succeeded to enhance the hcn abundance @xcite , but some do not @xcite .",
    "second possibility is energetic particles ( i.e. , cosmic rays ) either from agns or radio jets .",
    "this possibility , however , reduces the hcn and hnc abundances , and increases the hco@xmath9 abundance @xcite , which do not match with our results .",
    "another possibility is the high temperature gas phase chemistry as recently suggested by @xcite .",
    "this radiative transfer calculation includes the time - dependent interstellar chemical gas - phase reaction network , so that this calculation gives resultant molecular gas abundances under strong heating by x - ray irradiation .",
    "the calculation results show high hcn abundance , which matches with our observations .",
    "furthermore , the hnc abundance increase is an order of magnitude less than that for the hcn abundance , and the hco@xmath9 abundance shows decrement under this model , which again matches with our results of non - detection for the hco@xmath9(1  0 ) and hnc(1  0 ) lines . indeed ,",
    "the hco@xmath9 vibrational absorption line at @xmath102 m has not been detected toward the luminous infrared galaxies from which the hcn vibrational absorption line at @xmath67 m has been detected @xcite .",
    "since the hco@xmath9 vibrational transition is located at a similar wavelength and has a similar einstein coefficient as that of the hcn vibrational transition , non - detection of the hco@xmath9 absorption line suggests that the hcn abundance has enhanced compared to that of the hco@xmath9 , consistent with this model .",
    "in addition , high hcn / hnc abundance ratios have been observed toward active star forming cores @xcite , and low ratios in starless cores @xcite in our galaxy , which is again consistent with this model .",
    "our results therefore strongly support the model presented in @xcite .    on the other hand , the radiative transfer calculation results in sect .",
    "[ sect - dis - irpump ] can not realize hcn(1  0)/co(3",
    " 2 ) above unity even under the hcn abundance enhanced conditions ; in the co(3  2 ) map ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ch480kms ] ) , contours at the level of @xmath103 , namely @xmath104  k , are at the nucleus , but no intensity peak has been observed as in the hcn map , if we consider the beam size .",
    "this suggests that hcn(1  0 ) is stronger than co(3  2 ) at the nucleus , which is inconsistent with the calculation results in fig .",
    "[ fig - irp ] .",
    "one possible mechanism to make the hcn(1  0 ) emission strong is weak hcn masing .",
    "the infrared pumping can invert the population at the hcn(1  0 ) transition and possible to produce the maser emission at this transition @xcite .",
    "the hcn(1  0 ) masers have indeed been observed toward various carbon stars @xcite . under this excitation condition , and if the hcn molecule is distributed as an edge - on torus or disk that is similar to the water maser disk in ngc 4258 @xcite , it is possible to create hcn maser emission at the systemic velocity .",
    "this matches well with the strong hcn(1  0 ) nuclear emission only at the systemic velocity channel ( figs .",
    "[ fig - ch480kms ] and [ fig - spec ] ) .",
    "similar explanation has been discussed for the strong spike in the hnc(3  2 ) emission for the western nucleus of arp 220 @xcite , although our observation has not been detected any hnc emission , probably due to the high temperature gas phase chemistry in our case , as mentioned above .",
    "our results therefore suggest that there is a compact dense molecular gas in front of the type 2 agn in m51 that can not be resolved in our spatial resolution of @xmath0 ( @xmath1  pc )",
    ". this component can be the obscuring material for the type 2 nucleus of m51 ; assume this component has a size of @xmath105 pc ( i.e. , much smaller than the spatial resolution of our observations ) along the line of sight and a density of @xmath106 @xmath6 ( i.e. , consistent with the radiative transfer calculation results in sect .",
    "[ sect - dis - irpump ] ) , then the column density along the line of sight will be calculated as @xmath107 @xmath90 .",
    "this value is consistent with the column density of @xmath108 @xmath90 for the absorption material in front of the nuclear x - ray source ( i.e. , agn ) of m51 @xcite .",
    "it is highly required to observe with hcn lines with @xmath109 resolution toward m51 to directly image the obscuring material in front of the agn , which may give us knowledge about the still - unknown obscuring and feeding mechanisms of agns .",
    "our newly obtained @xmath0 ( @xmath1 pc ) resolution hcn(1  0 ) image toward the seyfert 2 nucleus of m51 ( ngc 5194 ) revealed the following results :    * the overall hcn(1  0 ) distribution and kinematics are similar to those of the co lines .",
    "since it is known that the kinematics derived from the co lines indicates the jet - entrained nature , this similarity indicates that the dense gas is also entrained by the jets and outflowing from the agn .",
    "* hcn(1  0)/co(1  0 ) brightness temperature ratio is stronly enhanced along the jets with the value around unity , and the value is similar to that of the shocked gas in the outflows from young stellar objects in our galaxy , suggesting that the hcn enhancement along the jets are highly related to shock . * a strong hcn(1  0 )",
    "emission has been detected toward the nucleus only at the systemic velocity channel .",
    "no co emission has been detected at this region and at this velocity , and therefore the ratio turned out to be more than 2 . to realize this high ratio ,",
    "it is suggested from our radiative transfer model that weak hcn maser triggered by the infrared pumping with hcn abundance enhancement is the possible mechanism .",
    "the most plausible configuration for emitting the hcn maser is a rotating edge - on dense molecular gas disk or torus around the agn , similar to the water maser disks in other seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "if this disk or torus has the size of @xmath105 pc and the density of @xmath106 @xmath90 , then it is possible to explain the nuclear obscuration for this type 2 agn in m51 . *",
    "cause of the high hcn abundance can be due to high temperature gas phase chemistry .",
    "non - detection of the hco@xmath9(1  0 ) and hnc(1  0 ) lines in our observations also support this model .",

    "we also thank dr .",
    "t.  umemoto for the permission to use the molecular line spectra of l1157 , and dr .",
