    "one of the major problems faced by both , new and existing online social and collaboration networks  such as facebook or stackoverflow  revolves around efficiently identifying and motivating the appropriate users to contribute new content . in an optimal scenario",
    ", this newly contributed content provides enough incentive for other users to contribute , triggering further actions and contributions .",
    "once such a self - reinforced state of increasing activity is reached , we can say that a system becomes self - sustaining , meaning that sufficiently high levels of activity are reached , which will keep the system active without further external impulses .",
    "for example , when looking at well - established collaborative websites , such as stackoverflow or wikipedia , we already know that at some point in time , these systems have become self - sustaining ( in terms of activity ) , evident in their steady growing number of supporters and overall activity .    however , these self - sustaining states are neither easy to reach nor guaranteed to last .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the growth of wikipedia is slowing down , indicating a loss in momentum and perhaps even first evidence of a collapse .",
    "moreover , we typically lack the tools to properly analyze these trends in activity dynamics and thus , can not even perform such simple tasks as detecting self - sustaining system states . therefore , we argue that new tools and techniques are needed to model , monitor and simulate activity dynamics for collaboration networks .    the high - level contributions of this work are two - fold .",
    "first , we introduce a model that is capable of simulating activity dynamics for online collaboration networks .",
    "second , we describe in detail how to fit the model to empirical datasets , simulate trends in activity dynamics and interpret our findings .",
    "the proposed model is based on the formalism of continuous deterministic dynamical systems  meaning that activity is modeled by a system of coupled non - linear differential equations .",
    "each user of the system is represented by a single quantity ( the current activity ) , and the social ties between users define the coupling of variables . in general , when using dynamical systems on networks , we define the ( micro-)behavior of each user to observe and gather new insights into the ( macro-)behavior of the system . for a more detailed introduction to dynamical systems",
    "see section  [ sec : related work ] and @xcite . for simplicity , we do not take individual differences between users into account ",
    "the dynamics and its parameters are the same for each user in the population .",
    "this allows us to configure the model with a single parameter , which is a ratio of the following two parameters , representing two basic activity mechanisms ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : act_dyn_prin ] ) in online collaboration networks :    1 .",
    "_ activity decay rate_@xmath1 , which postulates how fast users lose interest to contribute , 2 .",
    "_ peer influence growth rate_@xmath2 , postulating to what extent users are influenced by the actions taken by their peers .",
    "a first analysis of the model shows that activity dynamics in collaboration networks have an obvious and natural fixed point  the point of complete inactivity  where all contributions of the users have seized .",
    "however , by slightly manipulating the parameters in our model we show that it is possible to destabilize the fixed point , resulting in a potential increase of activity .",
    "we then outline the process of calculating the _ activity decay rate_and _ peer influence growth rate_for existing collaboration networks , simulate their corresponding activity dynamics and expand our understanding of critical mass  via the notion of _ system mass _ and _ activity momentum_in collaboration networks by interpreting our findings .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : modeling activity dynamics ] we introduce and examine our model analytically .",
    "we then continue with the model illustration by simulating activity dynamics for a synthetic dataset and discuss different evolution scenarios of our parameters and their implications . in section  [ sec : illustrative examples ] we outline the process of applying our model on empirical datasets . in section [ sec : momentum ] we introduce the notion of _ system mass _ and _ activity momentum _ , review related work in section  [ sec : related work ] and summarize our findings and discuss limitations and implications for future work in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we model activity dynamics in an online collaboration network as a dynamical system on a network . hereby , the nodes of a network represent users of the system and links represent the fact that the users have collaborated in the past .",
    "we represent the network with an @xmath3 adjacency matrix @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of nodes ( users ) in the network .",
    "we get @xmath6 if nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 are connected by a link and @xmath9 otherwise .",
    "since collaboration links are undirected , the matrix @xmath4 is symmetric , thus @xmath10 , for all @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the total number of links in the network with @xmath11 , and thus we have @xmath12 .",
    "we model activity as a continuous real - valued variable @xmath13 evolving on node @xmath7 of the network in continuous time @xmath14 .",
    "the general time evolution equation can be written as follows ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath15    where @xmath16 specifies the intrinsic activity evolution of node @xmath7 and @xmath17 describes the influence of neighbor @xmath8 on node @xmath7 . to simplify , we assume that the intrinsic activity dynamics as well as the influence of node neighbors are the same for each node @xmath7 and for each neighbor pair @xmath18 .",
    "this means that we have a single intrinsic activity function @xmath16 for all nodes @xmath7 , as well as a single peer influence function @xmath17 for all node pairs @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we make the following assumptions :    * intrinsic activity decay . * without external incentives or without positive influence from their social connections , each user has a tendency to slowly reduce activity . for example",
    ", people slowly lose interest to participate in collaborative networks or exhaust their resources .",
    "an observation that specifically reflects this inherent exhaust of activity over time has been made by @xcite for different online communities .",
    "we model this situation by using a linear function for @xmath16 : @xmath19    we call parameter @xmath1 the _ activity decay rate_the rate at which users reduce their activity per unit time , given a complete absence of other ( positive ) incentives .",
    "the specific form of @xmath16 results in an exponential decay ( @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the initial activity of node @xmath7 at time @xmath22 ) of activity without any external influence .",
    "thus , without other positive impulses the activity of every user will decay over time ( see figure  [ fig : fx ] )",
    ".    * positive peer influence .",
    "* people tend to copy their friends @xcite , meaning that if neighbors of a node @xmath7 are active they will positively influence node @xmath7 to become active as well .",
    "the magnitude of the influence , or the `` speed '' at which the influence is transferred from an active node to its neighbors will depend on two quantities ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : functions ] ) :    1 .",
    "_ critical activity threshold_@xmath23 , which represents a soft threshold of activity that marks the point when users have an activity potential , that notably exercises influence on their peers .",
    "note that influence is exercised at all levels of @xmath23 .",
    "however , once @xmath23 is reached , the influence is determined as `` notable '' ( e.g. , a level of activity that is above the average activity per user ) for the corresponding peers .",
    "hence , this critical level of activity is a system - dependent quantity .",
    "one can imagine that in a system with high user activity ( e.g. , a large number of changes per user ) the critical activity is higher than in a system with lower levels of activity .",
    "for example , in the latter case the users will sooner notice a neighbor who became active recently .",
    "we model the _ critical activity threshold_as a continuous threshold . meaning that active users will always influence their neighbors , but will exercise more influence after they have passed the critical level of activity .",
    "maximum peer activity flow_@xmath24 represents the maximum activity flow per unit time from users to each of their neighbors .",
    "this maximum flow is reached as user activity approaches infinity . however",
    ", substantial amounts of the maximum flow are already reached whenever the user activity passes the level of the critical activity @xmath23 .",
    "thus , to model peer influence , we resort to a monotonically increasing function , where more active neighbors are always more influential than less active ones . additionally , the function @xmath25 saturates for sufficiently large values of activity , inducing a natural limit on how much users can be influenced by their neighbors .",
    "we model this by setting @xmath26 and choosing an algebraic sigmoid function with : @xmath27    peer influence can also be analyzed in terms of the growth rate of @xmath28 , in the form of the derivative @xmath29 of the function @xmath28 . after simplifying and rearranging",
    ", the growth rate can be calculated as : @xmath30    in the limit of large activity @xmath31 the derivative of @xmath28 tends towards zero , thus peer influence saturates at @xmath24 . on the other hand , the maximum change in influence is observed when @xmath32neighbors who suddenly become active will be noted most , in terms of activity , by their peers .      with @xmath16 and @xmath25 defined , the activity dynamics equation becomes : @xmath33    the different parameters of the equation have dimensions .",
    "for example , @xmath13 and @xmath23 have activity as unit , @xmath14 has seconds as unit , @xmath1 is a rate and has inverse seconds as unit , and @xmath24 has activity per second as unit .",
    "further , the equation has three free parameters , which span a huge parameter space that is difficult to explore in detail .",
    "therefore , our first step is to simplify the equation and express it in a dimensionless form , which typically also has a smaller number of parameters as only their relative ratios , rather than their absolute values , are of importance . another advantageous side - effect of a dimensionless formulation is that it eliminates the absolute values of the properties under investigation , in our case user activity , which can be difficult to interpret .",
    "there are many ways to eliminate dimensions from such equations @xcite .",
    "a useful heuristic is to try to first eliminate the dimensions from the most non - linear term in the equation , which in our case is @xmath25 .",
    "thus , we begin by defining a relative activity @xmath34 as the ratio between the activity @xmath31 and the critical activity @xmath23 : @xmath35    the variable @xmath34 is dimensionless now , and it is easy to interpret .",
    "for example , the fact that @xmath36 means that users exercises a strong influence on their neighbors , since the level of activity is five times the critical activity @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , the influence in this case is @xmath37 . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath38 ( e.g. , @xmath39 ) , this then means that the influence of users on their neighbors is much smaller as @xmath40 .    by rearranging , substituting @xmath34 for @xmath31 and simplifying",
    "( @xmath23 cancels in the second term ) our activity dynamics equation reduces to :    @xmath41    to eliminate the dimensions from the second term we divide both sides with @xmath24 : @xmath42    the term @xmath43 is the growth rate of the function @xmath28 evaluated at zero : @xmath44    this quantity gives the rate at which the influence on the peers grows if the user activity experiences a small displacement from the point of zero activity .",
    "let us now define this quantity as _ peer influence growth rate_and denote it with @xmath45 since this will simplify the algebra and will make the model interpretation more intuitive .",
    "thus , the last equation can then be written as : @xmath46    finally , we also want to scale time @xmath14 and express the equation in terms of dimensionless time @xmath47 . this last reformulation will further simplify the equation and allows us to interpret and compare activity dynamics over time across various systems .",
    "the latter is possible due to the usage of dimensionless time @xmath47 to scale and compare the time evolution of different systems relative to each other .",
    "let us make the following substitution : @xmath48    by substituting @xmath47 for @xmath14 in the term on the left hand side in equation [ eq : dd ] we arrive at the dimensionless dynamics equation : @xmath49    now , there is only one parameter in our dynamics equation , namely the ratio @xmath50 .",
    "this is a dimensionless ratio of two rates :    the _ activity decay rate_@xmath1 , which is the rate at which a user loses activity , and    the _ peer influence growth rate_@xmath2 , which is the rate at which a user gains activity due to the influence of a _ single _ neighbor .",
    "the ratio between those two rates is the ratio of how much faster users lose activity due to the decay of intrinsic activity ( or interest ) than they can gain due to positive peer influence of a single neighbor .",
    "for example , a ratio of @xmath51 would mean that the users intrinsically lose activity @xmath52 times faster than they potentially can get back from one of their neighbors .",
    "if we would set @xmath53 , it would mean that users would lose activity as fast as they can regain it from one of their peers .",
    "for a short description of all parameters of the activity dynamics model see table  [ tab : model params ] .    .*model and model parameters . *",
    "the activity dynamics equation is in a dimensionless form and scales over relative time @xmath47 .",
    "all properties , as well as the single parameter of the model , are briefly described under @xmath54 and @xmath55 . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < \" , ]     [ tab : momentum ]    * activity momentum .",
    "* after calculating the _ system mass _ @xmath56 , we are now interested ( again analogously to classical mechanics ) in calculating the _ activity momentum _",
    "@xmath0 for our collaboration networks ( see equation  [ eq : act_momentum ] ) .",
    "@xmath57    for activity we take ( i ) the average activity ( posts and replies ) per week and ( ii ) the activity in the last month of our observation periods ( cf . table  [ tab : momentum ] ) and calculate ( i ) the average and ( ii ) the current momentum .",
    "the higher the _ activity momentum _ of a collaboration network , the more force is needed to `` stop '' ( make it inactive ) the system .",
    "hence , the higher the momentum , the more robust a given network . in particular , if a ( sufficiently ) small number of users would suddenly stop contributing to a collaboration network that exhibits a very large _ activity momentum _",
    "@xmath0 , activity in the overall network would be minimally influenced . on the other hand , if the same number of users would stop contributing to a collaboration network with a ( significantly ) smaller _ activity momentum _",
    "@xmath0 , chances are that their actions ( or lack thereof ) will have a notable influence on the overall trends in activity dynamics of the system .",
    "in particular , there are three factors that influence the _ activity momentum _ of collaboration networks :    1 .   _ the standard deviation of @xmath50 .",
    "_ if the ratio is very stable and does not frequently oscillate , the standard deviation and hence the normalized standard deviation will be very small .",
    "this also means that activity , as well as increases and decreases thereof , is equally distributed across @xmath47 and is not ( frequently ) exercised in bursts . 2 .   _ the largest eigenvalue @xmath58 . _",
    "larger and denser collaboration networks exhibit a larger highest eigenvalue @xmath58 .",
    "as @xmath59 is the normalized variance of the ratios over @xmath58 , the largest eigenvalue will directly influence @xmath59 .",
    "the notion of normalizing @xmath59 over @xmath58 follows the intuition that that large collaboration networks are less likely to exhibit sudden changes in activity than smaller ones .",
    "the activity . _ the larger the average activity ( posts and replies ) per month , the higher the _ activity momentum _ of a collaboration network , and hence the higher the force that is needed to render the collaboration network inactive .",
    "analogously , networks with a small _ activity momentum _ require less force to be influenced ( i.e. , to either speed up / increase or slow down / decrease activity ) .",
    "hence , we can use the calculated _ activity momentum _ @xmath0 as an indicator of the activity level as well as the tendency of a system to stay at that activity level in the future .",
    "for example , mathse exhibits the most robust collaboration network of our datasets regarding changes in activity , with an _ activity momentum _ of order @xmath60 ( average per week and last month ) .",
    "ese and 15mw both exhibit similar average _",
    "activity momenti _ of orders @xmath61 . however , when looking at the _ activity momenti _ of the last months , ese is roughly four times as hard to stop as 15mw .",
    "in contrast , hse and bse exhibits very similar activity levels for last month , however the corresponding _ activity momentum _ of hse is twice the one of bse , indicating that half the force is needed to render bse inactive than it would be needed to render hse inactive .",
    "the other datasets follow analogously .",
    "on the other hand , bp exhibits a high value for _ system mass _ and a very low corresponding _ activity momentum _ , indicating that it will be very difficult to to accelerate or jump - start the system with regards to activity .",
    "the work presented in this paper was inspired by and builds upon work presented in the areas of _ critical mass theory _ and _ dynamical systems on networks_.      in 1985 and 1988 , @xcite have discussed and analyzed the concept of critical mass theory by introducing so called production functions to characterize decisions made by groups or small collectives .",
    "fundamentally , these production functions represent the link between individual benefits and benefits for the group .",
    "they argue that one very important aspect of critical mass is the natural limitation of collective goods for groups such as housing , food , fuel or oil .",
    "hence , the capacity of users ( and thus critical mass ) for such a group or system is naturally limited by the corresponding resource . however , collective ( digital ) goods are not ( or only artificially ) limited for online communities ; theoretically allowing for an infinite increase in users and interest . without users motivated to contribute , interest will decrease and critical mass will lose momentum and ultimately decelerate until all interest vanishes . in their work",
    "they identified multiple different types of production functions , with the most important ones being : _ accelerating _ , _ decelerating _ and _ linear _ functions .",
    "the idea behind accelerating production functions is that each contribution is worth more than its preceding one . in a decelerating production function",
    "the opposite would be the case , resulting in each succeeding contribution to be worth less than the preceding one , while contributions to linearly growing functions are always worth the same . until today it is still mostly unclear what these production functions look like for online communities ( e.g. , stackoverflow ) and online production systems ( e.g. , semantic mediawikis ) .",
    "depending on the investigated or desired point of view , different characteristics of these communities and online production systems can be used as basis for calculating production functions .",
    "the analysis of @xcite also highlights that different production functions can lead to very different outcomes in similar situations .",
    "for example , given an accelerating production function , users who contribute to a system are likely to find their potential contribution `` profitable '' , as each subsequent contribution increases the value of their own contribution .",
    "naturally , this increases the incentive to make larger contributions to begin with .",
    "given a deceleration production function , users would not immediately see the benefit of large contributions , given that each subsequent contribution is increasing the overall value less , while more effort , in the form of larger contributions , is needed to turn a decelerating production function into an accelerating one .",
    "one approximation for critical mass by @xcite involved the investigation of the number of changes  as activity  and number of users  as growth of a community  for calculating production functions for wikiprojects .",
    "the authors argue that activity in online production systems , after certain amounts of time , is the best indicator of a self - sustaining system . in this work ,",
    "we have extended the analysis presented by solomon and wash and specifically define the point of when an online system has reached critical mass and has become self - sustaining in terms of its activity dynamics .",
    "@xcite recently conducted a similar analysis to characterize critical mass for semantic mediawikis .",
    "@xcite investigated factors that allow for a prediction of survival rates for irc channels and identified the production function of these chat channels regarding the number of unique users versus the number of messages posted at certain times , as the best predictor .",
    "@xcite have analyzed concepts of activation thresholds , which resemble features that , when achieved , can help to reach and sustain self - sustainability .",
    "they created an online platform that allow groups to pitch ideas , which only will be activated if enough people commit to it .    with regards to activity ,",
    "@xcite have shown that contributions to wikipedia are slowing down , which is likely a direct consequence of the increase in required coordination activities , as well as comprehensive contribution guidelines which discourage posts by users .",
    "kittur and kraut @xcite have demonstrated that when reducing the overhead for editors  effectively minimizing the efforts necessary to contribute to wikipedia  can help to increase the number of contributions and article quality .",
    "similarly , @xcite investigated the value and development of contributions to the question answering portal stackoverflow .",
    "in contrast , @xcite have investigated the evolution of two different types of users in stackoverflow , namely _ sparrows _",
    "( very active users ) and _ owls _ ( experts ) in the discussed topics , and could identify various differences between the two user - groups .",
    "we use the notion of critical mass to define the barrier , that has to be overcome , for collaboration networks to become self - sustaining in terms of activity .",
    "dynamical systems in a non - network context are a well - studied scientific and engineering field .",
    "generally , a dynamical system is any system that changes in time , whose behavior is determined by some specific rules or ( differential ) equations over a set of quantifiable variables .",
    "we distinguish between continuous and discrete as well as deterministic and stochastic systems . @xcite and @xcite",
    "provide excellent introductions and analyses of dynamical systems .",
    "different social and economic processes , which take place both offline and online , have been modeled with the use of dynamical systems . in the context of the web ,",
    "the primary focus of dynamical systems was set on analyzing and understanding the diffusion of information in online social networks @xcite , including the analysis of online memes and viral marketing .    on the other hand ,",
    "the bass model @xcite describes how novel products are accepted and adopted in a network and has seen a wide variety of applications in different fields of research and also for practical use .",
    "the model consists of two parameters , the propensity for innovation and the propensity for imitation .",
    "a product will be successfully accepted and adopted by the community , depending in the ratio between these two parameters .",
    "@xcite investigated factors that determine how social traits propagate within a specific popularity .",
    "@xcite conducted a viral email experiment , allowing them to track the diffusion of information in a social network .",
    "they showed that due to heterogeneity in human activity , the most common and simple growth equation from epidemic models is not suitable to model information diffusion in social networks .",
    "recently , in the context of activity dynamics , @xcite conducted an analysis of the daily number of active users that visit specific websites , fitting a model that allows to predict if a website has reached self - sustainability , defined by the shape of the curve of the daily number of active users over time .",
    "he uses two constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath62 represents the constant rate of active members influencing inactive members to become active .",
    "@xmath63 describes the rate of an active member spontaneously becoming inactive .",
    "whenever @xmath64 a website is unsustainable and without intervention the daily number of active users will converge to zero . if @xmath65 and the number of daily active users is initially higher than the asymptotic one , a website is categorized as self - sustaining .",
    "the model presented in this paper to simulate activity dynamics heavily relies on the concept of dynamical systems on networks .",
    "we strongly believe that by modeling and understanding activity dynamics , we will gain a better understanding of the processes involved in and around the concept of peer influence in collaboration networks .",
    "other areas of application for dynamical systems on networks are the modeling and simulation of diseases in the form of _ epidemic models _ , and opinions or traits of a person , also known as _",
    "opinion dynamics_.      modeling the outbreak of diseases can be seen as a special case of dynamical systems . at first",
    ", epidemic models dealt with the spreading of diseases in social ( real life ) networks @xcite , ignoring the underlying network aspect , simulating contractions and outbreaks via random encounters of the whole population under investigation . for an exhaustive survey of epidemic models refer to @xcite .",
    "henceforth , these models have been extended to include the structure and other aspects of the underlying networks @xcite , limiting the spread and outbreaks according to different factors .",
    "further , epidemic models were also utilized to simulate the spread for a plethora of properties in different kinds of networks , such as viruses spreading in computer networks @xcite and information propagation ( e.g. , memes ) @xcite among others .    in general , epidemic models",
    "are based on the intuition that a disease propagates through a social network with a given infection rate , defining the probability that a neighbor of an already infected node contracts the disease .",
    "different models have been developed and analyzed to simulate epidemic outbreaks in a population or network @xcite , which can only transfer on contact .",
    "typically , such an outbreak is modeled using a small number of possible states for each node and a fixed probability of contraction ( e.g. , @xmath63 , @xmath66 ) , which defines the probability or `` threshold '' that has to be reached for a node to change to a different state .",
    "for example , the si model consists of only two states ",
    "_ susceptible _ and _ infected _  and one probability parameter @xmath63 , that determines when the transition from susceptible to infected is initiated .",
    "note that transitions in the si model can only occur from susceptible to infected while already infected nodes remain infected indefinitely .",
    "as the infection rate is relative to the population under investigation , epidemic simulations with a small number of originally infected hosts usually start - off by slowly contracting the disease until exponential growth is reached .",
    "once the majority of the population carries the disease , the infection process slows down again until the whole population is infected .",
    "a more sophisticated extension to the si model is the sir model @xcite , which additionally introduces the _ recovered _ ( or _ removed _ ) state as well as an additional parameter @xmath66 to model the transition from infected to recovered .",
    "again , transitions only occur from susceptible to infected to recovered .",
    "as the name suggests , this newly introduced state allows nodes to become immune to the disease and will not be infected in the future , nor be able to infect other nodes .",
    "other models for simulating epidemic outbreaks are the sis and sirs models , where the population can recover but does not become immune ( sis ) or stays immune but still has a chance to become susceptible for infection again ( sirs ) @xcite .",
    "since their introduction , epidemic models have seen a wide array of application .",
    "for example , to analyze how computer viruses spread @xcite or the study of epidemics in complex ( scale - free , power - law ) networks @xcite .    among others @xcite as well as",
    "@xcite demonstrated the importance of the networks spectra ( eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the network adjacency matrix ) for epidemic and dynamical network models @xcite .",
    "we show a similar dependency of activity dynamics on eigenvalues in this paper in section  [ sec : modeling activity dynamics ] .",
    "another important field of application of dynamical systems on networks are opinion dynamics .",
    "they are used to model collective behavior and influence , usually in the form of a consensus - reaching task , at every point in time .",
    "the main idea behind the concept of social influence is that interacting agents strive to become more alike @xcite .",
    "for example , agents in the ising model for ferromagnets @xcite are influenced by the state / opinions of the majority of their peers .",
    "this influence naturally drives the system towards an ordered state where all agents are either positive or negative ( ferromagnets ) .",
    "hence , the model can be interpreted as a very simple model for simulating ( binary ) opinion dynamics .",
    "however , the transition probabilities of the ising model are influenced by temperature , representing the modeling of external or influential factors .",
    "in particular , if the temperature is above a certain threshold , consensus - finding , in terms of magnetization , becomes an unstable process that never converges .",
    "the potts model @xcite further extends the ising model by increasing the number of potential states an agent can assume from two ( positive or negative ) to an arbitrary number greater than two .",
    "other factors that might influence the process of reaching consensus is the size of the system under investigation @xcite . in particular , this means that differently sized ( or connected ) systems potentially need different strategies to reach consensus .",
    "opinions are usually represented as a set of words or numbers for each agent individually .",
    "@xcite introduced such a model , based on sociodynamics , in 1971 .",
    "@xcite analyzed the potential applications of the ising model for simulating opinion dynamics starting in 1982 .",
    "the most wide - spread and adapted models to simulate ( among others ) opinion dynamics are the voter model @xcite , the axelrod model @xcite as well as the naming game @xcite .    _ the voter model _ constitutes that each agent is equipped with a binary variable . at each step in time , the binary variable of one ( randomly chosen ) agent is synchronized with one of its neighbors variable . introducing the concept of social influence for opinion dynamics .",
    "the voter model has since been adapted and extended by many researchers to fit an array of different purposes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    _ the axelrod model _",
    "@xcite combines the notion of social influence ",
    "individuals becoming more similar upon frequent interactions  and the tendency that similar individuals will have a higher tendency ( and frequency ) to interact with each other .",
    "each agent is endowed with a set of characterizing variables .",
    "the more variables are shared among two agents , the more similar they are .",
    "given this description , one would assume that the described notions are self - reinforcing dynamics and hence , will inevitably produce stable networks with only identical agents .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that the resulting number of different states is dependent on the number of characterizing variables .",
    "large numbers are likely to result in very few similar individuals ( high agent diversity ) .",
    "analogously to the voter model , the axelrod model has been extensively adapted , analyzed and expanded by researchers to broaden our understanding of the spread of ( cultural ) traits across agents ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    _",
    "the naming game _",
    "originates from idea to analyze and explore the evolution of language @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced the most basic version of the naming game in 2006 , where a group of agents that communicate via a complete network , try to reach consensus when naming an entity .",
    "each agent holds a list of synonyms or words associated with the entity , also referred to as vocabulary , under investigation .",
    "every iteration ( or step in time ) , two agents are chosen .",
    "one agent is assigned the role of the speaker , who randomly choses a word of a given / pre - defined vocabulary . if the other agent  the listener  knows ( i.e. , also has the word in the vocabulary ) the chosen word , both agents discard all other words in their vocabulary and `` agree '' on the common word . however ,",
    "if the listeners do not know the word of the speaker , the word is appended to their vocabulary and no words are discarded . in the next step another pair of nodes is chosen and process is repeated until either consensus is found or a predetermined number of steps ( time ) have passed .",
    "the naming game has spurred a complete line of dynamical models with a variety of different parameters , that each address different problems and tasks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for an excellent and comprehensive introduction to opinion dynamics ( among others ) we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "we have developed a model to simulate and characterize the intricate dynamics of activity in collaboration networks , consisting of an _ activity decay rate_and _ peer influence growth rate_. first , we applied it on zachary s karate club ( see figure  [ fig : karate ] ) dataset to illustrate its core mechanics .",
    "subsequently , we continued with a linear stability analysis ( cf .",
    "section  [ subsec : linear stability analysis ] ) and depicted the behavior that can occur when the master stability equation is invalidated ( see figure  [ fig : karate ] ) . using our proposed model to simulate activity dynamics , we have shown that the overall activity in collaboration networks appears to be a composite of the _ activity decay rate_and the _ peer influence growth rate _",
    ", as described in section  [ sec : modeling activity dynamics ] . in section  [ sec : illustrative examples ] , we have fitted our model on synthetic and empirical datasets to simulate activity dynamics trends .",
    "the presented results are destined to be interpreted only and solely as an indicator for trends in activity dynamics , rather than absolute values that can be used for accurately predicting the activity for a given system .",
    "this is a direct result of the different approximations and simplifications ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : illustrative examples ] ) that we have made when estimating the parameters for our activity dynamics simulation .",
    "note that one advantage of our model over other existing approaches , such as autoregression , is the interpretability of the ratio @xmath50 .",
    "for example , a ratio of @xmath67 means that users intrinsically lose activity @xmath67 times faster than they can get back from one of their peers , while the coefficients of the autoregression lack such interpretable characteristics .",
    "further , using the concept of dynamical systems we can represent the underlying mechanisms in a closed form , allowing for detailed analytical analyses ( i.e. , the linear stability analysis ) , which is much harder ( if not impossible ) to conduct for other models , such as agent - based models , autoregression or more complex models based on dynamical systems .    for future work we plan on extending the ability of our model to not only reflect on changes in activity dynamics but also",
    "properly cope with structural changes in the underlying collaboration networks .",
    "one additional limitation of the presented approach is the fact that nodes with a very small degree , which are not connected to the largest connected component , inevitably will lose activity until they reach the point of total inactivity .",
    "including the structural evolution of a collaboration network in our analyses will allow us to mitigate this effect , as users will only be added to the collaboration network and considered in our calculations , once they have actually become active .",
    "one potential approach involves the investigation of snapshots of the collaboration networks at every @xmath47 , providing additional insights into the evolution of the parameters of our model and the investigated systems .",
    "additionally , we assume that peer influence is a symmetric property .",
    "this means that posts and replies exercise the same amount of influence on peers as we do not differentiate between different types of activity and influence will always traverse along both directions of the edges in our collaboration networks .",
    "further , tasks that do not trigger entries in the change - logs ( i.e. , reading articles , posts or replies ) are not considered in our experiments due to a lack of available data .",
    "the fact that the _ activity dynamics model_only requires a single parameter to be configured represents not only an advantage , but also a limitation .",
    "given that there is only one parameter that determines the evolution of activity in a system , we are not be able to model periodic fluctuations with only one ratio .",
    "instead , we have to calculate ratios for multiple points in time . for future work we plan on extending the _ activity dynamics model_by adding parameters , for example , to model different external influences . with this extended model",
    ", we will be able to simulate such periodic patterns with a single configuration .",
    "on the other hand , we are only able to model additional ( social ) mechanisms with the use of additional parameters .",
    "for example , one reason for the decreasing levels of activity in wikipedia might also be related to a very high barrier for newly registered users to add content due to comprehensive guidelines for contributions and a very concentrated and active community of power users . over time , these power users leave wikipedia for various reasons while new contributors are lacking to fill in the gaps .    furthermore , all of our estimated parameters are calculated for the collaboration networks as a whole .",
    "future work will also include extending the activity dynamics model to calculate the ratio @xmath50on a user level , rather than on a network level .",
    "this modification not only potentially increases the accuracy of our model but would also allow us to gather additional information for each user of the corresponding networks .",
    "further , with an increased accuracy in our simulations it will be possible to conduct activity prediction experiments and emulate network attacks as well as optimize ( arbitrary ) cost - strategies for increasing activity in these systems .    in this context",
    "it is also worth mentioning that decreasing levels of activity for collaboration networks can also signal that the community has completed their work and no further actions are required as the intended goal has been achieved .",
    "further analyses are required to determine if completeness and quality of content affect activity in collaboration networks .",
    "one could even argue that , once we are able to calculate @xmath50for each user , we could potentially observe the evolution of users and categorize different types of users in collaboration networks ( e.g. , early adopters or experienced users versus new and inexperienced users ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath50describing how fast users lose activity ( _ activity decay rate_@xmath1 ) over how fast they regains activity over their neighbors ( _ peer influence growth rate_@xmath2)fluctuates below the corresponding highest eigenvalue @xmath58 for all investigated empirical datasets .",
    "negative peaks in this ratio represent periods of time ( @xmath47 ; in our case weeks ) where activity grew faster than could be compensated by the _ peer influence growth rate_. it naturally follows that a decrease of @xmath1resulting in less activity - loss per contribution for each user  is necessary to accomplish such drastic increases of activity .",
    "if the network itself is of a smaller scale and/or these negative peaks occur on a frequent basis , the activity dynamics of the corresponding networks are depending on the contributions ( and thus influence ) of single ( individual ) users . to compare the stability of the activity dynamics across multiple networks we calculated the _ system mass _ and _ activity momentum _ @xmath0indicating the required force to accelerate or render the corresponding collaboration networks inactive .    when comparing @xmath0 and the results of our empirical illustration ( cf .",
    "figures  [ fig : empirical_illustration ] and [ fig : empirical_ratios ] ) between the different datasets , we can see that the _ activity momentum _ is very small for datasets that either ( i ) exhibit only a very small number of changes and are close to inactivity or ( ii ) exhibit a small @xmath58 ( see figure  [ fig : empirical_illustration ] and [ fig : empirical_ratios ] ) .",
    "this suggests that we can use _ activity momentum _ as an indicator for the robustness of a collaboration network with regards to its activity dynamics .",
    "further , we can characterize the potential of a collaboration network to become self - sustaining by comparing the calculated ratios of @xmath50with the corresponding @xmath58 and _ activity momentum_. if the ratio is below @xmath58 , our master stability equation is invalidated , pushing the system towards a new fixed point where the forces of the _ activity decay rate_and the _ peer influence growth rate_reach an equilibrium so that the network converges towards a state of immanent and lasting activity ( see figure  [ fig : karate ] ) . if such a state is reached and combined with a high _ activity momentum _",
    ", the corresponding collaboration network has reached critical mass of activity and has become self - sustaining ; no external impulses are required to keep the network active .",
    "of course , in real world scenarios , activity will not last forever without providing additional incentives as interest ( and thus activity ) in a system potentially decays over time . as a consequence",
    ", this would first result in an increase of @xmath2 and inevitably , with a sufficiently large @xmath2 , the collaboration network would return to its stable fixed point , once our master stability equation holds again , and activity would once more converge towards zero . once we extend our model to allow for user - based calculations , we will be able to not only calculate _ activity momentum _ for collaboration networks , but also for single and individual users .",
