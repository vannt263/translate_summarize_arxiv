    "since the first discovery of the @xmath13violating neutral kaon decay in 1964 , there has been made a big effort to describe the @xmath13 symmetry breaking within the standard model .",
    "the favoured theoretical framework was provided in 1973 by kobayashi and maskawa , who pointed out that @xmath13 violation would follow automatically if there were at least six quark flavours . at present the main experimental effort",
    "is focused on the neutral @xmath14 and @xmath15 meson system studies .",
    "however , there are still several interesting open issuses in the kaon physics , which can contribute to our better understanding of the @xmath13 violation mechanism  @xcite . for example",
    ", @xmath3 decays to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , requiring @xmath13 violation , are still poorly known .",
    "the @xmath16 final state can be produced in neutral kaon decays with isospin @xmath18 or 3 .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 states have @xmath21 , and @xmath3 can decay into them without violation of the @xmath13 symmetry . however , they are expected to be strongly suppressed by centrifugal barrier effects  @xcite . for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 states",
    "there is no centrifugal barrier and @xmath24 , so @xmath3 decay requires violation of this symmetry .",
    "anyhow the two kinds of final states can be separated by the analysis of the @xmath25 dalitz plot .",
    "this allows for determination of the @xmath3 to @xmath4 decay amplitude ratio @xmath26 , where @xmath27 indicates the @xmath3 @xmath13 impurity and @xmath28 is the contribution of the direct @xmath13violating term . in the case of @xmath29 final state ,",
    "only isospin @xmath22 or @xmath23 is allowed , for which @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 decay is a purely @xmath13 violating process , for which one defines the analogous ratio : @xmath30 .",
    "+ the present knowledge about @xmath31 and @xmath11 is poor mainly due to very low decay rates for the @xmath32 decays .",
    "the current value of the @xmath33 branching ratio amounts to @xmath34  @xcite , and the @xmath0 has been never observed .",
    "the best upper limit on this decay branching ratio amounts to @xmath35  @xcite , while the prediction based on standard model is equal to about @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we briefly describe the search of the @xmath0 decay based on the 1.7  fb@xmath37 of integrated luminosity gathered with the kloe detector operating at the @xmath2factory da@xmath1ne of the frascati laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the kloe experiment operated from 2000 to 2006 at da@xmath1ne , the @xmath38 collider optimized to work with a center of mass energy around the @xmath2 meson mass peak : @xmath39 = 1019.45 mev  @xcite .",
    "equal energy positron and electron beams collided at an angle of @xmath40  mrad producing @xmath2 mesons nearly at rest , which then decayed mainly to @xmath41 ( 49% ) and @xmath42 ( 34% ) final states .",
    "the decay products were registered using the kloe detection setup presented schematically in fig .",
    "the detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber  @xcite surrounded by a lead scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite , both immersed in an axial 0.52  t magnetic field produced by a superconducting solenoid .",
    "the beam pipe at the interaction region is a sphere with 10 cm of radius made of a beryllium  aluminum alloy of 0.5 mm thickness .",
    "the drift chamber , 4  m in diameter and 3.3  m long , has 12582 all stereo drift cells with tungsten sense wires . to minimize the @xmath4 regeneration , multiple coulomb scattering and photon absorption",
    "the chamber is constructed out of carbon fiber composite with low  z and low density , and uses the gas mixture of helium  ( 90% ) and isobutane ( 10% ) .",
    "it provides three  dimensional tracking with resolution in the bending plane about 200 @xmath43 m , resolution on the z  coordinate measurement of about 2 mm and of 1 mm on the decay vertex position .",
    "momentum of a particle is determined from the curvature of its trajectory in the magnetic field with a fractional accuracy @xmath44 for polar angles larger than 45@xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the kloe electromagnetic calorimeter covers 98% of the solid angle and is composed by a barrel and two endcaps , for a total of 88 modules .",
    "each module is built out of 1 mm scintillating fibers grouped in cells of 4.4x4.4 @xmath46 and embedded in 0.5 mm lead foils , and it is read out from both sides by set of photomultipliers .",
    "the particle energy deposits are obtained from the photomultipliers signal amplitude , while the arrival times and particles impact points are determined from the spatial coordinates of the fired calorimeter cell and the difference between times measured at both ends of the calorimeter module .",
    "the accuracies of energy and time determination are parametrized as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the trigger @xcite uses both calorimeter and chamber information . in the search for the @xmath0 we have used , however , only the calorimeter information requiring two energy deposits with @xmath49 mev for the barrel and @xmath50 mev for the endcaps .",
    "at kloe kaons arising from the @xmath2 decay move at low speed with their relative angle close to 180@xmath45",
    ". therefore , observation of a @xmath4 ( @xmath3 ) decay ensures the presence of a @xmath3 ( @xmath4  ) meson travelling in the opposite direction . about 50% of @xmath4",
    "s reach the calorimeter before decaying , which provides a very clean @xmath3 tag by the @xmath4 interaction in the calorimeter ( @xmath4crash ) .",
    "it is identified by a cluster with polar angle @xmath51 , not associated to any track , with energy @xmath52  mev and with a time corresponding to a @xmath4 velocity @xmath53 0.2 in the @xmath2 rest frame .",
    "the average value of the @xmath38 center of mass energy @xmath39 is obtained with a precision of 20 kev for each 200 nb@xmath37 running period using large angle bhabha scattering events  @xcite . the value of @xmath39 and the @xmath4crash cluster position allows us to obtain , for each event , the direction of the @xmath3 with an angular resolution of 1@xmath45 and a momentum resolution of about 2 mev .",
    "the search for the @xmath54 decay is then carried out by the selection of events with six photons which momenta are reconstructed using time and energy measured by the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "photons from the @xmath3 decay are reconstructed as neutral particles that travel with a velocity @xmath55 from the interaction point to the kloe calorimeter ( prompt photons ) . in order to retain a large control sample for the background",
    "while preserving high efficiency for the signal , we keep all photons satisfying @xmath56 7  mev and @xmath57 0.915 .",
    "each cluster is also required to satisfy the condition @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the photon flight time and @xmath60 the path length .",

    "are estimated using the monte carlo simulation tool of the experiment  @xcite .",
    "all the processes contributing to the background were simulated with statistics twice larger than the data sample .",
    "moreover , for the acceptance and the analysis efficiency evaluation a dedicated @xmath62 signal simulation was performed .",
