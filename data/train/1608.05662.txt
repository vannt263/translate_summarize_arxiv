    "in the 1950 s , w. heisenberg has offered the procedure of nonperturbative ( np ) quantization for a nonlinear spinor field @xcite . his purpose was to obtain all physical properties of electron from the first principles , i.e. from a fundamental equation , which he suggested to be the equation for a nonlinear spinor field . following this approach",
    ", he was able to obtain , to some accuracy , the main properties of electron .",
    "heisenberg s main idea was to write the operator nonlinear dirac equation .",
    "then , on multiplying by field operators and performing subsequent quantum averaging , one can obtain an infinite set of equations for all green functions . in order to make practical use of the infinite set of equations",
    ", he proposed to cut off this system of equations to obtain a finite set of equations .    in principle , this idea can be used for any strongly interacting fields . here",
    "we employ this approach for quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "our main goals are : ( a ) starting from the yang - mills operator equation , we write an infinite set of equations for all green functions ; ( b ) using some assumptions , we truncate this set of equations up to two equations describing gauge fields from the subgroup @xmath4 and gluon condensate for gauge fields belonging to the coset @xmath5 ; ( c ) we apply these two equation to obtain a flux tube solution describing the field distribution between quark and antiquark .    similar approach for the perturbative calculations of field correlators can be found in refs . @xcite-@xcite where the authors consider the formalism of gauge - invariant nonlocal correlators in non - abelian gauge theories and derive nonlinear equations for field correlators in the large @xmath6 gluodynamics .",
    "following heisenberg , we write the su(n ) yang - mills equations as operator equations @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the field strength operator ; @xmath9 is the gauge potential operator ; @xmath10 are the su(n ) color indices ; @xmath11 is the coupling constant ; @xmath12 are the structure constants for the su(n ) gauge group .",
    "how we can solve this equation ?",
    "following heisenberg @xcite , we have to write an infinite set of equations for all green functions @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a quantum state of the given physical system . for brevity , we will write @xmath16 instead of @xmath15 .",
    "the first equation is the equation for the 1-st order green function @xmath17 .",
    "but it contains green functions of the 2-nd order @xmath18 and 3-rd order @xmath19 ( for brevity , we omit all indices ) .",
    "the second equation is the equation for the 2-nd order green function @xmath20 .",
    "but it contains green functions of the 3-rd order @xmath21 and 4-th order @xmath22 .",
    "we see that such situation holds true for all other equations - .",
    "thus , to close this set of equations , we have to write an infinite system of equations .",
    "the solution of the full set of equations - gives us full information on a quantum state @xmath15 and field operators @xmath9 . in this sense",
    ", we can say that the solution of the full set of equations - is the solution of the operator field equations .",
    "in practice , we can not solve the infinite set of equations - . we need to cut it off to obtain a _",
    "finite _ set of equations .",
    "then the solution of the truncated set of equations - will approximately describe the solution of the full system . in order to do so",
    ", we have to use some physical intuition .",
    "for example , we can assume that @xmath23-th green function is a polylinear combination of @xmath24 green functions and use it either to cut off the set of equations - or to write an effective lagrangian which will be an averaged @xmath25 lagrangian .",
    "probably there exist other variants to cut off the infinite set of equations - .    in this section",
    "we use the following strategy : we assume that in some physical situations all @xmath25 degrees of freedom can be decomposed into two groups . in the first group , the gauge fields @xmath26 , where @xmath27 will be treated as classical fields , and @xmath28 is the quantum fluctuation around the classical field @xmath29 . in the second group , the gauge fields @xmath30 are pure quantum ones in the sense that @xmath31 .",

    "the dispersion of these fluctuations gives rise to the appearance of masses of the corresponding gauge fields .",

    ". the most interesting case here can be the case when classical non - abelian gauge fields are confined by a condensate of quantum gauge fields .",

    "one of the problems in qcd is to show that a flux tube filled with a longitudinal electric field does appear between quark and antiquark .",
    "the conventional opinion in this case is that the appearance of the flux tube is the manifestation of the dual meissner effect ",
    "the pushing out of color electric field from the gluon condensate .",
    "we have shown that in our two - equation approximation such a solution does really exist .",
    "that means that our approach can actually describe the dual meissner effect .",
