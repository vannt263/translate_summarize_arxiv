    "in thermodynamic perturbation theory of association involving short range interactions between molecules , the properties of the reference fluid plays a central role . in the typical situation",
    "when the reference is a hard - sphere fluid , perturbation theories usually use information about two body , and at times three body , correlations in the reference fluid to describe the physical ( associating ) system .",
    "for example , wertheim s theory @xcite and its extensions based on the statistical associating fluid theory ( saft ) @xcite use pair correlation information at contact to estimate extent of association between pairs of molecules . in saft , for the hard - sphere reference either the carnahan - starling @xcite equation for a single component fluid or the boublik - mansoori - carnahan - starling - leland @xcite equation for a mixture are used to describe the pair - correlation information at contact .",
    "the structure of wertheim s theory or saft is such that one can obtain accurate extent of association and thermodynamics even for systems with strong inter - particle interactions provided the representation of the reference is adequate .",
    "however , as the complexity of the interaction increases in the physical system , such as may result from multiple bonding and size asymmetries , information about two or three body correlations in the reference no longer suffices .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we studied the multi - body correlation functions of a symmetric hard sphere reference fluid in terms of the probabilities of observing @xmath0 molecules in the bonding region .",
    "these occupancy probabilities were obtained from enhanced sampling monte carlo simulations for the hard sphere fluid .",
    "we developed a procedure to use this information within the marshall - chapman formalism @xcite to describe multiple association of solvent molecules to a solute molecule .",
    "this _ complete reference _ approach proved successful in predicting the bonding state and thermodynamics of a colloidal solute in a patchy solvent for a wide range of system conditions @xcite .    here",
    "we study mixtures where the solute diameter is as small as half to as large as twice the diameter of the solvent .",
    "the solvent particles are spheres with directional interaction sites and the solute particles are spheres with isotropic interactions , and the solute is capable of bonding with multiple solvent particles .",
    "the structure and thermodynamics of mixture of hard spheres with different diameters has been studied in detail before @xcite , but a compact form for the correlations beyond the contact value is still unavailable .",
    "further , for systems with large size asymmetries even the pair - correlation information obtained using the boublik - mansoori - carnahan - starling - leland equation is inadequate @xcite .",
    "our approach of including multi - body correlations rests on using the occupancy statistics @xcite of the hard - sphere solvent around the hard - sphere solute .",
    "we find that representing multi - body correlation functions in terms of occupancy statistics in physically reasonable observation volumes accurately captures the multi - bonding effects in asymmetric mixtures .",
    "these occupancy statistics are obtained from particle simulations .",
    "importantly , we also present a physically transparent , statistical mechanical model to describe the occupancy probabilities in symmetric and asymmetric hard sphere fluids for different packing fractions .",
    "this model corrects multi - body effects obtained for isolated clusters by incorporating the role of the cluster - bulk interface and the bulk medium effects .",
    "we also investigate the energy - entropy decomposition of the chemical potential of the solute in a model system with only solute - solvent interactions to better appreciate the role of the reference fluid . throughout",
    ", theoretical results are validated versus molecular simulations    the rest of the paper is organized in the following way . in section  [ sc : bentheory ]",
    "we discuss the association potential of the system and describe how packing effects are important for the given potential .",
    "the marshall - chapman @xcite theory is briefly introduced to show the multi - density representation of the free energy , and based on our previous work @xcite , an improved representation of multi - body correlations(_complete reference _ ) is presented . in section  [ sc :",
    "hstheory ] , we examine hard sphere packing around a reference particle and develop models based on statistical mechanics @xcite and hard sphere simulation data for different densities .",
    "we apply our complete reference approach for different asymmetric mixtures of solute and solvent and present results in section  [ sc : res_asso ] . in section  [ sc : res_hs ]",
    "we present results for the hard sphere reference system ( symmetric and asymmetric mixtures ) based on the correlation developed in section  [ sc : hstheory ] .",
    "we also provide simulation results for isolated cluster probabilities in asymmetric hard sphere mixtures in the appendix ( section  [ sc : appen ] ) .",
    "the focus of our study is asymmetric mixtures containing molecules with short range attractive interactions .",
    "the short range association potential is the same as that in previous work @xcite : the solute molecule can associate with multiple solvent molecules isotropically and the patchy solvent has directional interactions .",
