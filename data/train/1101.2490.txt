    "the latter effect can be understood in terms of the destructive interference of the coherent lo phonon as observed in gaas @xcite and other materials.@xcite the value of @xmath0 @xmath23 64 fs is significantly close to the characteristic time of ( 3/4)@xmath34 (= 57.8 fs ) , at which the lopc+ oscillation reaches its maximum ( when assuming the lopc+ mode is a sine - like oscillation ) . to investigate the oscillatory phase of the lopc+ mode",
    ", we fit the time - domain data of the single pump [ labeled 1 ; bottom in fig .",
    "2 ] with damped harmonic oscillations ( not shown ) , and as the results , the sine - like phase was confirmed for the lopc+ and lopc- modes . on the contrary ,",
    "the cosine - like phase was observed for the lo mode , being consistent with the previous result.@xcite according to ref .",
    "[ 23 ] , if @xmath0 does not match a maximum of the oscillation of the lopc modes , the oscillation is suppressed and the ballistic motion can not be obtained . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath0 matching a maximum of the oscillation would give long - surviving motion , suggesting @xmath0 = ( 3/4)@xmath34 should be a necessary condition for ballistic motion of the lopc+ mode . thus , the enhancement of the relaxation time at @xmath0 @xmath23 64 fs satisfies approximately both conditions ; ( i ) minimum lo phonon amplitude ( @xmath0 @xmath23 @xmath17/2 ) , and ( ii ) ballistic motion of the lopc+ mode by coherent excitation with @xmath0 @xmath23 ( 3/4)@xmath34 .",
    "a plausible reason for the enhancement of the relaxation time is reduction of the frhlich - type carrier - lo phonon scattering due to minimizing the lo phonon amplitude , which would occur at the value of @xmath0 @xmath23 57.5 fs ( = @xmath17/2 ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . at room temperature ( 295 k ) , however , there is a substantial thermal population of lo phonons , which interact with the plasmon - like lopc mode and would contribute to its relaxation .",
    "this contribution might be much stronger than the contribution of the coherent lo phonon generated and manipulated optically . in order to check these possibilities , we consider the ratio of the total number of the coherent lo phonons @xmath35 to the total number of the lo phonons as given by,@xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of thermal ( incoherent ) lo phonons expressed by @xmath38^{-1}$ ] . in the case of the gaas - like lo",
    "phonon the ratio @xmath39 was experimentally obtained to be 0.091 at 1 @xmath5j/@xmath21.@xcite consequently we would expect @xmath39 @xmath23 1 ( maximum coherence ) in our case ( 60 @xmath5j/@xmath21 )",
    ". then we found from eq .",
    "( 1 ) that the ratio of the coherent lo phonon is @xmath40(t = 295 k ) @xmath23 0.78 .",
    "it follows that the ratio of the thermal lo phonon is 1- @xmath40(t = 295 k ) @xmath23 0.22 .",
    "although there is the constant thermal population of lo phonons as estimated above , the contribution of the coherent lo phonon is enough to affect the relaxation of the plasmon - like lopc mode under our experimental condition .",
    "based on the above investigations , we argue overall understanding of the enhancement of the relaxation time of the lopc+ mode in more details . in the case of the thermal lo phonon ,",
    "high enough temperatures enable all lo phonons to participate in the frhlich - type carrier - lo phonon scattering process , which involves the absorption and emission of lo phonons ; the interaction occurs very often at room temperature , and then reduces the mobility.@xcite to link this scenario with our case , we are controlling the amplitude of the coherent lo phonon [ @xmath40(t = 295 k ) @xmath23 78 % in the maximum ] by the optical means , instead of changing the lattice temperature , leading to the reduction of the probability of scattering events if the amplitude of the coherent lo phonon becomes minimum , where @xmath40(t = 295 k ) @xmath23 0 .",
    "additionally , the synchronization of free - streaming current by the second pump - pulse would lead to the condition of another ballistic motion of plasmons , leading to the subsequent formation of the ballistic motion of the plasmon - like lopc+ mode , whose oscillation persists up to @xmath25 @xmath28 300 fs , as uncovered in the inset of fig .",
    "2 .    note that other scattering processes than the frhlich - type carrier - phonon scattering can not contribute to the `` @xmath0 dependence '' at room temperature because the arrival time of the second pump - pulse changes only the amplitude of the lo phonon , and not change carrier density , defect density , and amplitude of acoustic phonons within the time scale of a few hundred femtoseconds .",
    "to summarize , we have obtained the enhancement of the relaxation time of the plasmon - like lopc+ mode through the coherent control of the amplitude of both the lo phonon and plasmon - like lopc modes in n - gaas by use of the femtosecond pump - pulse pair .",
    "this effect would be attributed to the two possible origins , that is the minimum frhlich - type carrier - lo phonon scattering and ballistic motion of the plasmon - like lopc+ mode , induced by coherent excitation with the ultimate condition of @xmath0 @xmath23 @xmath17/2 @xmath23 ( 3/4)@xmath34 ."
