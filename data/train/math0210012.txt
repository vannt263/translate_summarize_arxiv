    "everyday experience tells us that thin elastic sheets _ crumple _ , when confined into a small volume , _ e.g. _ a sheet of paper `` confined '' by ones hands .",
    "crumpling also plays an important role in the mechanical behavior of packaging material and in the dissipation of the energy of collisions by the `` crumple zones '' of automobiles .",
    "crumpling is therefore a problem of much intrinsic interest , but understanding this behavior is complicated by the complex morphology of a typical crumpled sheet .    despite the complicated appearance of a crumpled sheet ,",
    "the crumpling phenomenon is in itself very robust .",
    "it is easily observed in thin sheets made from a variety of materials , suggesting that it can be studied using simplified or idealized models that capture the essential features of thin elastic sheets .",
    "this approach leads one to consider a crumpled sheet as a minimum energy configuration for a simple elastic energy functional for thin sheets , _ viz . _",
    "the fpl  von karman ( fvk ) energy . using this approach of elastic energy minimization , the crumpling response is now understood as a result of the elastic energy of the sheet concentrating on a small subset of the entire sheet @xcite .",
    "the energy in a crumpled sheet is concentrated on a network of thin line - like creases ( ridges ) that meet in point - like vertices .",
    "recent work has resulted in quantitative understanding of both the vertices @xcite and the ridges @xcite . scaling laws governing the behavior of crumpled sheets",
    "have been obtained in the physics literature @xcite .",
    "minimum energy configurations for the fvk energy have also been studied in the context of the _ blistering problem _ , _ viz .",
    "_ the buckling of membranes as a result of isotropic compression along the boundary .",
    "the blistering problem is relevant to the delamination of thin films that are chemically deposited at high temperatures , as well as the mechanical behavior of micro - fabricated thin - film diaphragms @xcite .",
    "there is a considerable body of mathematical work focused on the blistering problem @xcite .",
    "upper and lower bounds have been obtained for approximations to the elastic energy @xcite , for the fvk energy @xcite and for full three dimensional nonlinear elasticity @xcite .",
    "the fvk energy and full three dimensional nonlinear elasticity give the same scaling for the upper and the lower bounds .",
    "this yields a rigorous scaling law for the energy of a blister .",
    "as we discuss below , the scaling laws for the blistering problem are different from those for the crumpling problem , even for the _ same energy functional_. this indicates that the energy minimizing configurations for the fvk energy show an interesting dependence on the boundary conditions .",
    "the minimization of the fvk elastic energy is an example of a non - convex variational problem that is regularized by a singular perturbation @xcite .",
    "it is well known that this can lead to a variety of multiple - scale behaviors including energy concentration and/or small scale oscillations in the minimizers @xcite .",
    "multiple scale behaviors , both _",
    "microstructure _ and _ singularities _ , are ubiquitous in condensed matter systems .",
    "the crumpling phenomenon appears to be a particularly simple and tractable instance of multiple scale behavior . for this reason",
    ", there has been much recent interest in physics literature about the nature of the crumpling phenomenon @xcite .",
    "asymptotic analysis @xcite and scaling arguments @xcite show that the ridge energy scales as @xmath3 where @xmath1 is the thickness of the sheet , and @xmath4 is the length of the ridge .",
    "ben - amar @xcite and mahadevan @xcite show that the energy of a @xmath5-cone scales as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius of the core associated with the vertex .",
    "it is clear that the ridge energy is asymptotically larger than the vertex energy as @xmath8 .",
    "however , which of these two energies is important for a given sheet depends on the relation between the nondimensional thickness @xmath9 of the sheet , and the `` crossover thickness '' @xmath10 which is determined by setting @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 in turn depends on the values of the multiplicative constants for these scaling laws .",
    "these multiplicative constants can not be determined by scaling arguments .",
    "mahadevan @xcite estimate the constant for the vertex energy numerically using an ansatz for the shape of a sheet near the vertex , and they find that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the complement of the tip angle of the cone @xcite . based on lobkovsky s work @xcite , boudaoud",
    "@xcite estimate the value of the constant in the ridge energy as @xmath15 .",
    "this implies , for the experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite  and  @xcite , the vertex energy dominates the ridge energy",
    ".    it would be useful to prove these scaling laws , and determine the multiplicative constants rigorously , that is , in an ansatz - free manner . in this paper",
    ", we propose a model problem that yields structures analogous to a single ridge in a crumpled sheet .",
    "we prove a rigorous lower bound ( with a numerical value for the multiplicative constant ) for the elastic energy in our model problem .",
    "this is a step toward rigorously proving the scaling law of lobkovsky for the ridge energy @xcite .",
    "we also discuss how the techniques in this paper can be extended to prove similar results for a `` real '' crumpled sheet , as opposed to our model problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows  in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] , we describe the problem of interest , set up the relevant energy functional and determine the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we also rescale the various quantities to a form that is suitable for further analysis , and recast the problem in terms of the rescaled quantities . in sec .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we are interested in a _ minimal ridge _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the single crease that is formed when a long rectangular elastic strip is bent through an angle by clamping the lateral boundaries to a bent frame .",
    "this situation is depicted in figure  [ fig : ridge ] .    from the symmetry of the problem ,",
    "it is clear that we only need to consider one half of the strip .",
    "this is represented schematically in figure  [ fig : coords ] .",
    "we will use ( the material ) coordinates @xmath16 on the reference half strip @xmath17 , @xmath18 . also , we associate a @xmath19 coordinate systems in space , so that as @xmath20 , the half - strip is asymptotically in the @xmath21 plane , as depicted in figure  [ fig : coords ] .",
    "the grid in the figure is generated by the lines @xmath22 and @xmath23 that are straight in the reference ( material ) coordinates .",
    "@xmath24 represents the out of plane deformation , and the in - plane coordinate are chosen so that the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 axes are asymptotically parallel to the @xmath27 and @xmath28 axes respectively as @xmath29 . since the sheet is bent through an angle @xmath30 , as @xmath31 , the sheet will lie in the plane @xmath32 .",
    "the symmetry of the two halves implies that the the line @xmath33 maps into the plane @xmath34 , which bisects the angle between the planes @xmath21 ( the asymptote as @xmath20 ) and @xmath32 ( the asymptote as @xmath35 ) .",
    "the symmetry between the two halves also implies that the tangent to the lines @xmath22 at @xmath33 should be perpendicular to the plane @xmath36 .",
    "consequently @xmath37 and @xmath38 at @xmath33 .",
    "a mathematically justified way to obtain the elastic energy of the deformed sheet is to treat the sheet as a three dimensional ( albeit thin ) object and use a full nonlinear three dimensional elastic energy functional for the energy density .",
    "this approach however does not take advantage of the `` thinness '' of the sheet .",
    "in particular , we would like to treat the thin sheet as a two dimensional object .",
    "this will greatly reduce the complexity of the problem .",
    "the derivation of reduced dimensional descriptions of thin sheets has a long history .",
    "there is a classical theory for thin elastic sheets built on the work of euler , cauchy , kirchoff , fpl and von karman @xcite .",
    "many modern authors have considered the problem of deriving a reduced dimensional theory @xcite from three dimensional elasticity in a mathematically rigorous fashion through @xmath39  convergence @xcite .",
    "convergence is the appropriate notion for convergence in variational problems . in the context of thin sheets , roughly speaking , finding the @xmath39  limit amounts to identifying an appropriate two dimensional energy functional whose minimizers give the limiting behavior of the minimizers of the full three dimensional energy in the limit the thickness @xmath40 .",
    "this problem hasnt been solved in its entirety .",
    "there are two situations for which reduced dimensional theories have been derived rigorously as @xmath39  limits of full three dimensional elasticity .",
    "membrane theories @xcite are applicable in situations where the stretching is essentially uniform through the thickness of the sheet and bending theories @xcite are applicable in situations where the the sheet is essentially unstretched , and all the elastic energy is due to strains that are first order in the thickness of the sheet",
    ".    neither of these theories are applicable for the minimal ridge . for the minimal ridge ,",
    "both the stretching ( membrane ) energy and the bending energy are important .",
    "in fact , a ridge is a result of the competition between these two energies .",
    "so we turn to the classical fpl ",
    "von karman _",
    "ansatz _ for an appropriate definition of the elastic energy @xcite .",
    "although the fvk energy is not rigorously derived from three dimensional elasticity , it can be thought of as the sum of the membrane and the bending energies that have been derived rigorously in different limiting situations .",
    "we will further assume that , for the minimal ridge , the deflections @xmath41 and @xmath42 are small compared to the natural length scale @xmath4 .",
    "the strains are of the order of the square of the maximum deflection divided by @xmath4 and they are small . after some rescaling , the energy of the deformed sheet is given by the linearized fvk energy @xmath43 dx dy \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sigma^2 \\int ( w_{xx}^2 + 2 w_{xy}^2 + w_{yy}^2 ) \\ , dx dy .",

    "the integrand for the first integral is given by the squares of the linearized strains , @xmath44 the blistering of thin films is also described by the elastic energy in ( [ eq : unscaled ] ) .",
    "a similar energy also describes multiple scale buckling in _ free _ elastic sheets ( _ i.e. _ sheets that are not forced through the boundary conditions ) that are not intrinsically flat @xcite .",
    "the difference between the blistering problem and a minimal ridge is in the boundary conditions , which we describe below .",

    "the upper bound is usually obtained by constructing a test solution that yields the bound .",
    "one is often guided by scaling arguments in the construction of the appropriate test solution .",

    "a harder problem is to show that the scaling laws also hold for a real crumpled sheet , where the forcing is not through clamping the boundaries to a frame , but rather through the confinement in a small volume . in this case , there are interesting global geometric and topological considerations , some of which are explored in refs .",
