    "these theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with experiment @xcite .    since a few years ago lattice qcd has started to impact chpt and the study of pion scattering .",
    "increase in computer power and algorithmic advances nowadays allow unquenched simulations with light pion masses so that contact with chpt can be made .",
    "monitoring the quark mass dependence of the pion mass and the pion decay constant various lattice groups have obtained estimates for the low energy constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 that enter the one - loop chpt results of these two observables @xcite .",
    "these two constants play an important role for pion scattering , in particular @xmath7 , since it dominates the uncertainties in the isospin zero and isospin two scattering lengths @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the scattering lengths can also be computed directly on the lattice , and two unquenched calculations for the @xmath5 scattering length @xmath9 have been performed so far .",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration simulated two dynamical wilson quarks at three lattice spacings between 0.1 and 0.2 fm @xcite .",
    "the pion masses , however , were rather heavy , spanning the range 0.5 to 1.1 gev .",
    "thus , contact to chpt is not expected .",
    "the nplqcd collaboration @xcite performed a mixed action simulation with domain - wall valence quarks and staggered sea quarks .",
    "the four pion masses were in the range 290 to 490 mev and the lattice spacing @xmath10 fm .",
    "since data at one lattice spacing only was generated and due to the use of different actions in the sea and valence sector mixed action chpt @xcite was used to extrapolate simultaneously to the continuum and chiral limit . the obtained result for @xmath9 agrees very well with the experimentally measured one .    in this paper",
    "we study pion scattering in wilson chpt ( wchpt ) @xcite , the low - energy effective theory for lattice qcd with wilson quarks .",
    "we compute the scattering amplitude to one loop including the leading corrections due to the non - zero lattice spacing . from the scattering amplitude",
    "we derive expressions for the scattering lengths in all three isospin channels which can be used to analyze lattice data before the continuum limit has been taken .",
    "we work in two different quark mass regimes : ( i ) @xmath11 and ( ii ) @xmath12 . these are most likely applicable to todays and future simulations with light wilson quarks .",

    "however , the value in the chiral limit is of order @xmath15 and not of order @xmath16 , as one might naively think based on the ( broken ) symmetries of the wilson fermion action .",

    "experience shared by many lattice groups is that the lattice data does not show the characteristic curvature due to the continuum chiral logarithms .",

    "the numerical calculation of phase shifts and scattering lengths is usually done by employing the so - called lscher formula @xcite in order to circumvent the maiani - testa no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "this formula relates the two - pion energy eigenvalues in finite volume to the infinite volume scattering length of the two - pion scattering process .",
    "in addition to the power law finite volume dependence of the the two - pion energy eigenvalues , which one exploits to extract the infinite volume scattering lengths , there are exponentially suppressed finite volume corrections .",
    "these have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and it is straightforward to include these in our results . however , these corrections are expected to be very small on typical lattice sizes , much smaller than the corrections due to the non - zero lattice spacing . for example",
    ", for a pion mass of approximately 300 mev and a finite volume with @xmath129 fm the finite volume correction to the @xmath5 scattering length is about 1 to 2% @xcite .. ] on the other hand , taking @xmath130 at @xmath131 fm found by the etm collaboration at a charged pion mass of about 300 mev @xcite , we obtain the rough estimate of about 35% for the o(@xmath15 ) corrections in this channel .",
    "although the numerical value for @xmath132 has a large error bar and can easily be a factor of 2 or 4 smaller , these numbers indicate that the finite volume corrections are most likely much smaller than the lattice spacing corrections .",
