    "its scientific payload included 4 narrow field instruments ( hereafter nfis ; for a detailed description of the scientific payload see boella et al .",
    "1997 ) covering nearly three orders of magnitude for energy from 0.1 up to 300 kev . during",
    "its lifetime bepposax observed about 20 fields of isolated pulsars detecting the source in more than half of them .    in this review , the most relevant spectral and timing results for the three more intense crab - like pulsars , crab , psr b1509 - 58 and psr b0540 - 69 , and three millisecond pulsars ,",
    "psr j0218 + 42 , psr b1937 + 21 and psr b1821 - 24 are reported .",
    "the crab pulsar ( psr b0531 + 21 ) is the only rotation powered pulsar observed at almost every energy band of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "its pulse profile is characterized by a double peak structure with a phase separation of 0.4 , approximately aligned in absolute phase over all wavelengths .",
    "the relative intensity , height and width of the two peaks varies with energy : in particular , the first peak ( p1 ) , dominant al low energies , becomes smaller than the second one ( p2 ) in the soft @xmath0 rays .",
    "the enhancement of the bridge between these peaks - hereafter named inter - peak ( ip ) region - as function of energy is also well evident .",
    "the crab pulsar was first detected in the x - ray band by frits et al .",
    "( 1969 ) and by bradt et al .",
    "the heao-2 satellite produced the first high resolution ( @xmath1 4 \" ) image of the crab nebula / pulsar in x - ray along with the phase profile ( harden and seward 1984 ) .",
    "pravdo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported detailed pulse - phase resolved spectral analysis of the pulsed emission obtained with the pca ( 5  -  60 kev ) and hexte ( 16  -  250 kev ) instruments on board rossixte .",
    "they found systematic spectral changes in the photon power law index as a function of pulse phase .",
    "recently , kuiper et al .",
    "( 2001 ) by using the high energy @xmath0-ray data from the cgro satellite together with data obtained at soft / hard x - ray energies from other observatory obtained an exhaustive high - energy picture of the crab pulsar from 0.1 kev up to 10 gev .",
    "bepposax observed the crab nebula and pulsar several times because this source was used for periodical calibration of the nfis .",
    "all these observations provide a high statistics data set ( @xmath1 200 ks ) that allowed to perform a very accurate timing and spectral analysis over an energy range wider than two orders of magnitude from about 0.1 up to 300 kev ( see massaro et al . 2000 for details ) . timing analysis for this source",
    "was performed producing phase histograms for each nfi and each pointing .",
    "the values of p and @xmath2 were derived from the jodrell bank crab pulsar monthly ephemeris ( http://www.jb.man.ac.uk ) . the good signal to noise ratio of the nfis , together with the high statistics allowed to describe the pulse profiles over the entire band in very high detail as shown in the top panels of fig .",
    "the morphology change of the profile as function of the energy is striking , with the second peak increasing from the soft range of the lecs ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) up to the harder range of the pds ( 15 - 300 kev ) .",
    "phase resolved spectral analysis was performed with a minimum phase resolution of 0.00667 unless the count number was not high , as in the interpeak region and in some energy ranges , where wider phase intervals were taken to reduce the statistical uncertainty in estimating the spectral parameters . modeling the spectra with a simple power law , photon indices were computed for each nfi .",
    "a column density @xmath3=3.2@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 derived from the spectrum of the off - pulse interval ( massaro et al .",
    "2000 ) was fixed for all following fit procedures .",
    "the bottom panels in figure 1 show the phase evolution of the spectral index in the four nfis .",
    "the photon index changes along with the phase with a similar phase dependence in each panel : the softer emission is in p1 and p2 region while the hardest is in the middle of ip ; the spectral index difference @xmath7 is of the order of 0.3 - 0.5 . moreover , comparing the panels from left to right , we can note that the photon index , relative to the same phase interval , significantly increases with the energy . in particular , photon index of p1 changes from 1.6 in the lecs range to 2.1 at higher energies , that of p2 from 1.8 to 2.0 and ip from 1.2 to 1.8 .",
    "the phase evolution of the spectral index is very similar to that found by pravdo et al ( 1997 ) , but the spectral softening towards higher energies is not so clear as in our results because of the worse s / n ratio of the rxte data at energies greater than 100 kev .    to explain the phase evolution of the spectral index and the change of the pulse shape with the energy a two component model was proposed by massaro et al .",
    "they considered that the observed pulsed emission is due to the superposition of two components having different phase and energy distributions .",
    "the first component was assumed to have the same pulse profile as observed at optical frequencies with p1 much more prominent than p2 and a very low intensity in the ip region , the second one with a harder spectrum and a phase profile estimated from the bepposax data , by means of a fitting procedure of several pulse profiles at different energies , in order to reproduce the observed pulse profile when it was summed to the first component .",
    "this second component was found to be much higher than the first one in the ip region , while the two components have a comparable intensity in the p2 region .    as a consequence of the photon index behaviour with energy , shown in figure 1",
    ", we found that a single power law was not able to give a satisfactory representation of the spectral distribution , for a fixed phase interval region , over the entire bepposax range ( 0.1 - 300 kev ) .",
    "better fits were obtained using a second order law in the double log representation :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is taken equal to 1 kev , and therefore @xmath10 corresponds to the photon index at this energy , while @xmath11 measures the curvature of the spectral distribution . applying this model to three wider phase intervals , the first peak ( p1 ) region ( 0.99 - 0.01667 ) , the interpeak ( ip ) region ( 0.01667 - 0.28 ) and the second peak ( p2 ) ( 0.3833 - 0.4167 ) we obtained a value for the bending parameter @xmath11 of @xmath1 0.15 over the three phase intervals , and for the @xmath10 parameter the values 1.63@xmath120.08 ( p1 ) , 1.31@xmath120.03 ( ip ) and 1.55@xmath120.09 ( p2 ) .",

    "( 2000 ) .",
    "pulsed emission has been detected in the range 1.6 - 10 kev for the 3 millisecond pulsars .",
    "all detected light curves have double peak profiles with high pulsed fraction and with a phase separation of about 0.5 .",
    "psr j0218 + 4232 shows spectral variation with phase : the relative intensity of the two peaks varies with energy with a behaviour that strongly recalls the crab pulsar .",
    "similar behaviour seems also present in the other two milliseconds ( psr b1937 + 21 and psr b1821 - 24 ) , although it needs to be confirmed with future more significant data set .",
    "the pulsed emission of these milliseconds is modeled by a flat power law indicating a likely non - thermal emission .",
    "the x - ray profile morphology and the hard non - thermal spectra suggest a similar magnetospheric origin of the high - energy emission of these millisecond pulsars and the crab .",
    "the comparison with crab is additionally enforced by the similar values of the magnetic field at the light cylinder as already pointed out by kuiper et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and kawai and saito ( 1999 ) : the magnetic field strength @xmath50 of psr j0218 + 4232 , psr b1821 - 243 and psr b1937 + 21 is in the range of 3 and 10 @xmath4 10@xmath51 gauss , and that of the crab is 9 @xmath4 10@xmath51 gauss . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic field strength at the neutron star surface @xmath52 of the millisecond pulsars is more than 4 order of magnitude weaker than the crab one .",
    "the similar value of @xmath50 seen in these millisecond pulsars and in the crab suggest that the magnetic field strength near the light cylinder is a key parameter to explain their high energy emission , indicating as likely model for the high energy emission the outer gap model .",
    "however , the polar cap scenario can also account for high - energy emission from these milliseconds pulsars ( luo , shibata and melrose 2000 ; dyks and rudak 2002 ) .",
