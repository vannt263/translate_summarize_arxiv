    "bell inequalities @xcite play a fundamental role in the investigation of non - classical features of quantum mechanics ( qm ) , from the foundational problems raised by the impossibility of a local hidden variable description of quantum systems , to applications for quantum information processing like entanglement - based reduction of classical communication complexity @xcite , device - independent secure communication @xcite and randomness expansion @xcite .",
    "similar inequalities , called non - contextuality inequalities , arise in the discussion of quantum contextuality @xcite .",
    "in fact , the origin of all these inequalities is rooted in logic and probability @xcite and can be traced back @xcite to boole s notion of conditions of possible experience @xcite ; they are necessary conditions for the interpretation of a set of experimentally observed relative frequencies as probabilities in a single probability space .    from an algebraic point of view @xcite ,",
    "bell and non - contextuality inequalities can be seen as conditions for the extension of a function , defined on a subset of a boolean algebra , to a normalized measure on the entire boolean algebra , a problem already investigated by horn and tarski @xcite .",
    "a general method for the derivation of bell and non - contextuality inequalities is based on pitowsky s notion of correlation polytope @xcite .",
    "such a polytope appears in many fields and with different names ( see @xcite for a extensive survey of the topic ) .",
    "its geometrical structure is completely defined by a set together with a family of its subsets .    in the framework of qm , the above set",
    "is a set of observables and the subsets correspond to subsets of compatible or jointly measurable observables .",
    "the operational definition of such notions is still under discussion @xcite .",
    "they have been defined in different ways according to the experimental scenario and the physical assumptions involved ( e.g. , space - like separated measurements , sequential measurements ) .",
    "such distinctions are irrelevant for our discussion . on the contrary",
    ", the use of an abstract notion of compatibility allows us for a unified presentation of our mathematical results which are valid in all the above mentioned scenarios .    given a set of observables together with the subsets of compatible observables ,",
    "the corresponding correlation polytope is defined as the convex hull of a set of vectors , the vertices or extreme points of the polytope , representing possible truth assignments for observables and logical conjunctions between compatible pairs , triples , etc .",
    "every convex polytope has two representations : one as the convex hull of its vertices ( @xmath0-representation ) and the other as the intersection of a finite number of half - spaces ( @xmath1-representation ) , each given by a linear inequality .",
    "complete sets of tight ( i.e. , facet supporting ) bell inequalities associated with a given set of observables precisely amount to the @xmath1-representations of the corresponding correlation polytopes .",
    "the @xmath1-representation of a convex polytope can be computed starting from its @xmath0-representation by solving the hull problem . for high - dimensional polytopes ,",
    "this is a very difficult problem .",
    "in fact , this method has been used only to compute simple cases @xcite , by means of programs such as ` cdd ` @xcite , ` lrs ` @xcite and ` porta ` @xcite .",
    "more recently , an alternative approach has been proposed by avis , imai , ito and sasaki @xcite , which is based on the relation between correlation polytopes and a family of convex polytopes called cut polytopes , well studied objects in polyhedral combinatorics , and a variable elimination method derived from fourier - motzkin method of elimination of variables ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and called triangular elimination .",
    "their method provided more than two hundred millions new tight bell inequalities for cases in which the corresponding hull problem is computationally intractable . however , since such a method is based on cut polytopes , it can be applied only to the bipartite case .    here",
    "we present an alternative general method based on the application of fourier - motzkin variable elimination method to conditions derived in ref . @xcite as consistency conditions for putting together partial extensions of quantum probabilities in order to obtain a classical probability description .",
    "more precisely , such conditions are expressed in terms of a systems of linear inequalities where also correlations between incompatible observables appear as variables : a classical probability space representation exists for a given set of qm predictions if and only if the corresponding system of linear inequalities admits a solution ; bell , or non - contextuality , inequalities are obtained by eliminating the variables associated to correlations between incompatible observables .",
    "our approach can be seen as a generalization of fine s derivation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) polytope @xcite .",
    "the above method also provides a generalization of the result obtained by sliwa @xcite and collins and gisin @xcite , namely , the appearance of only a finite number of families of bell inequalities in measurement scenarios where one experimenter is allowed to choose between an arbitrary number of different measurements .    the variable elimination method can also be applied to a family of correlation polytopes called complete probability polytopes . in this case , the method may not provide a significant computational advantage with respect to other known algorithms .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that such results are interesting and we collected them in [ app : a ] .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] , the notion of correlation polytope is reviewed , together with the result on extensions of probabilities associated with tree graphs . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we discuss their application to the problem of the computation of @xmath1-representation for general correlation polytopes , and provide some examples . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we discuss some possible further developments and computational results .",
    "in this section , we recall the definition of correlation polytope and its probabilistic interpretation ; then we introduce the notion of compatibility graph for a set of observables and present the main result about the classical probability space representation for the corresponding qm predictions .",
    "we use the definition of correlation polytope given in @xcite , which is the natural generalization of pitowsky s notion @xcite to higher order correlations , but with a slightly different notation .    given a set of propositions @xmath2 and a family @xmath3 of subsets of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 , we define the sets @xmath6 , @xmath7 with @xmath8 , as the sets of logical conjunctions @xmath9 .",
    "the lines of the truth table associated to the above set of propositions and logical conjunctions between them , namely the @xmath10 vectors of @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , are called the vertices of the correlation polytope .",
    "their convex hull , i.e. , the set of points generated by their convex combinations , is called the correlation polytope associated to @xmath3 and denoted as @xmath14 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following notation which makes apparent the correspondence between coordinates and joint probabilities .",
    "the coordinates of a point @xmath15 will be denoted as @xmath16    in order to clarify our notation , it is convenient to present a simple example , the chsh scenario . consider the bipartite scenario in which one experimenter , say alice , can choose between two dichotomic measurements , associated with propositions @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and another experimenter , say bob , can choose between two dichotomic measurements , associated with propositions @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the set of propositions is , therefore , @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the measurements associated with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , can be performed jointly and , consequently , it makes sense to consider the following set of logical conjunctions @xmath26 .",
    "the associated polytope is described by @xmath27 vertices in @xmath28 , namely @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents a classical @xmath31-valued assignment to proposition @xmath22 and @xmath32 the classical assignment for the logical conjunction @xmath33 .    as a consequence of weyl - minkowski theorem",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , each convex polytope has a double description : one as the convex hull of its vertices @xmath34 , i.e. , the @xmath0-representation , and one as a ( finite ) intersection of half - spaces which generates it , each one given by a linear inequality , i.e. , the @xmath1-representation .",
    "the convex hull of vertices ( [ eq : vch ] ) gives a set of linear inequalities constraining the coordinates of a generic point in @xmath28 , which we denote by @xmath35 such inequalities , known as chsh inequalities , are presented in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ch])([eq : ch4 ] ) below and will be discussed in more detail .",
    "the interpretation of such a geometrical object is the following : given a vector belonging to the polytope , each component represents the joint probability for the corresponding subset of propositions , e.g. , @xmath36 represents the joint probability @xmath37 ; the whole polytope gives possible ranges for such joint probabilities if the underlying probabilistic structure is assumed to be classical , i.e. , given by a probability space or , equivalently ( since the number of propositions is finite ) by a normalized measure on a boolean algebra .",
    "it is interesting to define the complete probability polytope associated to @xmath38 propositions @xmath39 , it is the correlation polytope @xmath40 , i.e. , the correlation polytope for a set of compatible proposition , in particular , @xmath41 .",
    "the importance of such polytopes has been already recognized in @xcite , namely , the fact that each @xmath42 can be obtained as a projection of @xmath43 ( on the subspace @xmath44 )",
    ". a more detailed discussion , containing also an algebraic derivation of the @xmath1-representation for complete probability polytopes , can be found in [ app : a ] .",
    "we now recall a result on extension of probability measures which allows for another projection - based approach to the computation of @xmath1-representation of correlation polytope .",

    "we recall that a boolean algebra is freely generated by @xmath38 generators @xmath54 if such generators are as much unconstrained as possible , i.e. , they satisfy no conditions except those necessary conditions defining a boolean algebra ( e.g. , distributive law ) .",
    "since all boolean algebras freely generated by @xmath55 generators are isomorphic , for the sake of simplicity , we can think of the the algebra of subsets @xmath56 of the set @xmath57 , with set theoretic operations @xmath58 ; then the subsets @xmath59 , for @xmath60 , can be taken as free generators . in terms of propositions and truth assignments ,",
    "the free boolean algebra assumption amounts to the assumption that each possible @xmath31-valued assignment to propositions is admissible . for more details see @xcite .",

    "the above results provide a general method for the computation of @xmath1-representation for correlation polytopes which consists in solving the hull problem for a smaller polytope , then constructing an higher dimensional polytope from that solution , and applying variable elimination methods such as , e.g. , the fourier - motzkin method .",

    ", we obtain a new system of inequalities not containing @xmath66 . from a geometric point of view , since the system of linear inequalities can represent a polytope ( more generally , a cone ) , the above operation amounts to a projection on the coordinates associated with the variables @xmath75 .",
    "our method consists in exploiting the automatically existing classical representations for subsets of observables with compatibility relations described by tree graphs , see propositions [ prop : tree1 ] and [ prop : tree2 ] above . conditions for classical representability arise as consistency ( i.e. , coincidence on intersections ) conditions for putting together partial extensions associated with subgraphs , giving rise to a description of the initial compatibility graph as a tree graph on such extended nodes .",
    "such consistency conditions are expressed in terms of the existence of a solution for a set of linear inequalities .",
    "one of the main application of fourier - motzkin algorithm is precisely deciding whether a system of inequalities has a solution .",
    "moreover , we shall discuss how this result gives an account for the appearance of a finite number of families of bell inequalities in cases in which one experimenter can choose between arbitrary number of different measurements while such a number is fixed for the others , as recognized by sliwa @xcite and collins and gisin @xcite for the case in which alice perform two measurement and bob an arbitrary number .",
    "we recall that , although our method is general , different strategies are possible corresponding to different partitions of the initial graph into subgraphs .",
    "we shall discuss our method by means of some simple examples .",

    "in fact , the two classical descriptions would give rise to an extension of the probability assignment to the four observables satisfying the hypothesis of proposition [ prop : tree2 ] ( see figure [ fig1 ] ( a),(b),(c ) ) .",
    "the constraints on the subsystem @xmath76 imposed by the third observable , @xmath19 or @xmath20 , are described by the bell - wigner polytope , i.e. , the correlation polytope associated to three propositions and their pairwise logical conjunctions , which is given by the following inequalities , obtained in ref.@xcite , @xmath81 for @xmath82 or @xmath83 . for fixed @xmath84 @xmath85 or @xmath86 ,",
    "the above inequalities give ranges for the classical probabilities for a system of three proposition and their pairwise joint probabilities .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , by proposition [ prop : tree1 ] , each subset of three observables always admit a classical representation ( see also figure [ fig1 ] ( b ) ) ; therefore , for fixed @xmath84 , the above system of inequalities admits a solution , i.e. , a value can be assigned to the joint probability @xmath87 ( which is assumed to be experimentally unmeasurable , since it is associated with two noncommuting observables ) consistently with the constraints imposed by the classical model and the measurable joint probabilities @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this implies that , for fixed @xmath84 , the elimination of variable @xmath87 gives rise only to trivial inequalities , i.e. , inequalities always satisfied by quantum predictions .",
    "an analysis of the constraints imposed on such `` experimentally unmeasurable '' joint probabilities has been presented in @xcite .",
    "analogous situations always arise in the bipartite scenario and this additional property just gives more information about the triviality of certain inequalities .",
    "however our method can also be applied to the general multipartite case .",
    "classical representability for qm prediction in the chsh scenario amounts , therefore , to the existence of a common solution for the two systems of linear inequalities , namely , it amounts to the existence of a value for @xmath87 consistent with the constraints imposed by classical descriptions for the two subsystems of three observables .    as a consequence of general properties of fourier - motzkin method ( see @xcite ) , a system of inequalities admits a solution if and only if the projected system , i.e. , the system obtained by eliminating one or more variables , admits a solution .",
    "it follows that the above set of measurements admits a classical description if and only if measured correlations , i.e. , correlations between compatible observables , satisfy the system of inequalities obtained by eliminating @xmath87 .    in order to eliminate @xmath87 ,",
    "we just combine inequalities where @xmath87 appears with opposite sign and keep inequalities where it does not appear .",
    "as discussed before , by proposition [ prop : tree1 ] , combining inequalities with the same index @xmath84 gives rise only to trivial inequalities , in particular , they are also redundant . a posteriori , we know that the same happens also for inequalities ( [ eq : bw1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bw2 ] ) .",
    "the interesting inequalities are those obtained from the combination of ( [ eq : bw3])([eq : bw6 ] ) for different @xmath84 , namely @xmath90 for instance , @xmath91 is obtained as a sum of inequality ( [ eq : bw3 ] ) for @xmath92 , which contains the term @xmath93 , with inequality ( [ eq : bw5 ] ) for @xmath82 , which contains the term @xmath94 .",
    "inequalities ( [ eq : ch])([eq : ch4 ] ) , together with the inequalities ( [ eq : bw1 ] ) , ( [ eq : bw2 ] ) in which @xmath87 does not appear , give the @xmath1-representation of the chsh polytope ( compare with , e.g. , @xcite ) .      an analogous argument applies to the scenario in which alice can choose between two measurements and bob can choose among @xmath96 measurements , associated to propositions @xmath97 : the initial system of inequalities is still given by ( [ eq : bw1])([eq : bw6 ] ) , but with @xmath84 taking values in @xmath98 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ( d ) ) .    since only one variable ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) has to be eliminated , at most two inequalities with different index @xmath84 can be combined to give a valid inequality .",
    "therefore , the final set of inequalities is given by ( [ eq : ch])([eq : ch4 ] ) with the pair @xmath99 substituted by any pair @xmath73 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this is precisely the result obtained in refs .",

    "now consider the bipartite scenario in which alice can choose among three measurements , associated with propositions @xmath77 and @xmath19 , and bob can choose among three measurements , associated with propositions @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "analogously to the previous case , see figure [ fig2 ] , the existence of a classical description for the six observables is equivalent to the existence of classical descriptions for the three subsystems , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , coinciding on @xmath79 .",
    "a probability on @xmath79 is completely defined , see lemma [ lemma : misunic ] below , once the probabilities @xmath107 are given .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to calculate the correlation polytope associated with probabilities @xmath108 , then consider the system given by all the above inequalities for @xmath109 and eliminate the variables @xmath110 .

    ", width=415 ]      again , by adding observables only on bob s side , one just obtains more copies of the initial system of inequalities , but with different indices @xmath84 .",
    "the situation is analogous to that depicted in figure [ fig1 ] ( d ) , but with @xmath113 substituted by @xmath114    in particular , since four variables have to be eliminated , at most @xmath27 inequalities with different indices @xmath84 can be combined . as a result ,",
    "all families of valid inequalities for the general case @xmath112 already arise in the case in which alice performs 3 measurement and bob 16 .",
    "the above argument can be extended to the case of @xmath116 parties in which the first @xmath117 can choose among @xmath118 , with @xmath118 fixed , measurements , while the last one can choose among @xmath119 , with @xmath38 arbitrary , measurements : all families of inequalities can be obtained by studying the case in which the last experimenter performs @xmath120 measurements , where @xmath121 is the number of variables to be eliminated .",
    "we have presented an alternative method for the computation of half - space representation for correlation polytopes based on algebraic conditions and variable elimination .",
    "a reasonable question is : does it provide any advantage with respect to existing methods ? in order to show the advantages of the tree graph method , we have computed the @xmath1-representation for some simple polytopes , with ( i ) our tree graph method using existing software implementing the fourier - motzkin algorithm ; specifically , we used ` porta ` @xcite and ` fm ` library @xcite , and ( ii ) using standard software for solving the hull problem ; specifically , we used ` cdd ` .    for simple cases like the @xmath122 ( i.e. , the chsh ) and @xmath123 scenarios ,",
    "the computation is equally fast with both methods .",
    "however , remarkably , our tree graph method is noticeably faster to compute asymmetric scenarios :    for the @xmath124 scenario , the tree graph method implemented with ` porta ` completed the calculation in @xmath125 11 minutes , while ` cdd ` needed @xmath125 20 minutes .",
    "the 11 minutes include the time ( seconds ) required to calculate the initial polytope ( see sec .",
    "[ subs33 ] ) .    for the @xmath126 scenario ,",
    "the tree graph method implemented with ` porta ` completed the calculation in @xmath125 72 minutes , while ` cdd ` was still running after a week and we had to stop it .",
    "all computations were performed on the same machine with an intel xeon cpu running at @xmath127 ghz .    however , beyond the practical advantage the tree graph method has to compute some scenarios , the main purpose of this paper is to point out that , for some polytopes , the @xmath1-representation can be easily expressed by means of simple algebraic arguments , and then these polytopes can be related to those associated to polytopes arising in physically interesting scenarios by means of variable elimination methods . for example , the boolean algebraic approach in ref .",
    "@xcite provided , already in 1948 , complete sets of bell inequalities . to our knowledge , this approach has never been investigated in relation to bell inequalities , and we hope that our work will stimulate further developments in this direction .",
