    "radio pulsars are believed to be the most common manifestations of neutron stars , but it has not been possible so far to relate the voluminous data on radio pulses and their varied structure to the properties of neutron stars except through the arrival times of pulses . here",
    "we make such a connection between pulse core component widths derived from very good quality radio data and the mass - radius ( m - r ) relation of neutron stars .",
    "this becomes possible only due to the inclusion of general relativistic effects of the stellar mass on pulsar beam shapes , which makes the stellar mass and radius relevant parameters in determining the pulse widths .",
    "we show that core component widths provide tight constraints on equations of state ( eos ) of neutron stars .",
    "we compare our results with other similar attempts based , e.g. , on the x - ray data . from our constraints",
    "it emerges that no neutron star eos seem to be adequate , leading to the conclusion that pulsars are strange stars , i.e. , ones composed of quarks of flavors u , d , and s ( alcock et al .",
    "1986 ) ; and we examine it in light of similar recent suggestions .",
    "a classification of radio pulse components into ` core ' and ` conal ' emissions has emerged which is based on various characteristics such as morphology , polarization , spectral index etc . of the pulses ( rankin , 1983 ) . radio pulsars often show a three peaked pulse profile , the central component of which is identified as the core emission , as opposed to the outrider conal pair ( rankin , 1990 ) . by analysing the core components of many pulsars , especially the ` interpulsars ' which emit two pulses half a period apart in one pulse period , rankin ( 1990 ) found a remarkable relation between the pulse width w and the pulsar period p ( in seconds ) for pulsars",
    "whose magnetic dipole and rotation axes are orthogonal , viz .",
    "@xmath2 here @xmath3 is the angle between magnetic and rotation axes .",
    "this relation ( henceforth the rankin relation ) provides a fit to data within @xmath4 % and the observations themselves have errors on the average of @xmath5 % . thus eq .",
    "1 is a rare example of an extraordinarily good fit .",
    "in addition , the rankin relation has also been used ( rankin 1990 ) to predict @xmath3 values for some other pulsars which are not interpulsars .",
    "these predicted values agree very well with determinations of @xmath3 based on data about other components in the same pulsars ( rankin 1993 ) .",
    "thus its remarkable fit to the core component data is supported in addition by data on other pulsars .",
    "the rankin relation in our view is one of the most reliable observational relations derived from the radio pulsar data .",
    "the import of the currently accepted ` polar cap model ' of pulsar radio emission is that the radiation originates from the magnetic polar regions .",
    "the polar cap is defined on the stellar surface by the feet of the dipolar magnetic field lines which penetrate the ` light cylinder ' , i.e. a cylinder of radius @xmath6 with rotation axis as its axis .",
    "@xmath7 is the speed of light .",
    "pulsar emission occurs in this ` open field line ' flux tube at an altitude @xmath8 measured radially from the center of the star .",
    "we refer to the surface of emission as the _ emission cap _ which coincides with the polar cap when @xmath9 the stellar radius .    as shown in fig .",
    "1 the line of sight cuts the polar cap along the line ls .",
    "this will lead to a pulse of width @xmath10 . if ls passes through the centre , then @xmath11 , the longitudinal diameter of the polar cap . for interpulsars",
    "ls passes very close to the centre and hence @xmath12 . for a value of @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 can not be recovered from @xmath10 alone .",
    "one also needs to know the displacement of ls from the centre , usually called the impact angle @xmath15 .",
    "if polarization data is available in addition to @xmath10 , then both @xmath15 and @xmath14 can be retrieved from observations .",
    "the core component width data used by rankin ( 1990 ) pertains only to inter - pulsars .",
    "therefore , in essence the width w in eq .",
    "[ e1 ] is the longitudinal diameter @xmath16 of the emission cap and is thus independent of @xmath3 ( kapoor and shukre , 1998 , henceforth ks ) . from the dipole geometry ( goldreich and julian , 1969 , henceforth gj )",
    "one finds @xmath17    on the assumption that the full emission cap participates in the core emission , agreement between eqs .",
    "[ e1 ] and [ e2 ] immediately allows the conclusion that @xmath18 .",
    "this remarkable agreement has provided compelling evidence favouring the origin of the core emission from the stellar surface as well as the dipolar configuration of the stellar magnetic field ( rankin , 1993 ) .",
    "note that a value of the stellar radius @xmath19 really has not entered the considerations so far .",
    "however , @xmath20 is considered to be the cannonical value of @xmath19 , and it is on this basis that @xmath8 is identified with @xmath19 .",
    "in the analysis of radio pulse structure , if the role of the radius @xmath19 has been insignificant , then it is even more so for the stellar mass @xmath21 .",
    "inclusion of effects due to the spacetime curvature caused by pulsar s mass changes this as follows .",
    "the stellar gravitational field affects the dipole field geometry and also causes bending of the rays of the emitted pulsar radiation .",
    "the former tries to shrink the emission cap while the latter has the opposite effect of widening it . a detailed study of these effects has been done and described in ks . in summary , we give below an analytic but approximate version of how eq .",
    "[ e2 ] is modified , i.e. , @xmath22 where the factors @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively due to squeezing of the dipole magnetic field and bending of light by the stellar gravitation and are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 is the schwarzshild radius .",
    "[ e2 ] is recovered in the limit @xmath28 .    in eq .",
    "[ e3 ] the effects due to special relativistic aberration are not included .",
    "since stellar gravitational effects are significant for @xmath29 ( ks ) we consider only such emission altitudes here .",
    "even for the @xmath30 pulsar psr 1929 + 214 , therefore , aberration does not play a role in considerations here . in what follows , however",
    ", the calculations include all the effects completely , as in ks . for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",
    "the net effect on the emission cap on the surface is a shrinking by @xmath33 % compared to the value in eq .",
    "although small , this difference allows us to relate @xmath21 and @xmath19 , and as we shall see provides tight constraints on the pulsar eos .",
    "2 shows the variation of @xmath34 with @xmath8 for various values of @xmath21 as labelled .",
    "the points where the rankin line intersects the curve for a particular mass @xmath21 gives for that @xmath21 the altitude(s ) where the core emission must originate .",
    "generally there are two intersection points , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 . in the limiting case",
    "@xmath38 the two points coalesce . for higher values of @xmath21",
    "there is no intersection .",
    "the mass @xmath39 is @xmath40 , which we take as @xmath41 .",
    "thus we can conclude that core emission does not occur if @xmath42 .",
    "probably , this is an indication that _ all _ radio pulsars have masses @xmath43 because the incidence of core emission among radio pulsars is @xmath44 % ( rankin , 1990 ) .",
    "thus @xmath45 this constraint , though of interest , is not useful since observationally all masses seem to be well below it .",
    "the second constraint involves @xmath19 .",
    "the lowest altitude at which any emission can occur is @xmath19 .",
    "therefore for values of @xmath21 below @xmath39 , @xmath46 since @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on @xmath21 we get a constraint on the pulsar mass - radius relation from the inequalities [ e6 ] .    for all masses , values of @xmath35",
    "are almost same as @xmath27 and if taken seriously would imply that pulsars are black holes .",
    "we therefore consider only @xmath36 .",
    "values of @xmath36 range from 10.2 to 10.6 @xmath47 for masses between 0.6 to 2.5 @xmath48 .",
    "for masses between 1 @xmath48 and 2.2 @xmath48 , values of @xmath36 remarkably enough are not very sensitive to @xmath21 and are all close to 10.5 @xmath47 as seen in fig .",
    "again , pulsar masses are observationally seen to be well covered by the range 1.0 - 2.2 @xmath48 and so we can take @xmath49 as the upper limit for all @xmath21 .",
    "lower values of @xmath36 occur for lower values of m and their inclusion will only tighten the constraint further since for all eos a decrease in mass implies an increase in radius .",
    "the rankin relation thus leads us to the second constraint @xmath50 which is applicable to radio pulsars which show core emission , and , as remarked earlier , to most probably all pulsars .",
    ".eos for which m - r plots are available . for meaning of @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath52 see text .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,<,<,>,>,^ , < , < , > \" , ]      + @xmath53names and values are from salgado et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "we have considered only the non - rotating neutron star models because most pulsars are slow rotators . but inclusion of rotation ( or magnetic field ) will not change the situation because , in that case , for a given mass one expects larger radii on general physical grounds .",
    "it should be noted that similar attempts using the pulsar timing data ( glitches ) and x - ray source data ( quasi - periodic oscillations ) do not provide such stringent constraints and are also not so selective of the eos ( psaltis and chakrabarty , 1999 , van kerkwijk et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "also , our constraints are not dependent on uncertainties in theoretical models , i.e. , of accretion disks , and rely on very simple and fundamental assumptions .",
    "our constraints make crucial use of the rankin relation and the assumption that the core emission emanates from the full polar cap .",
    "_ it will be of great interest to re - evaluate both of these independently_. the database presently available is presumably more voluminous than in 1990 because the number of known pulsars has more than doubled since then and it can be used to further fortify the rankin relation . on the other hand",
    "it would be worthwhile also to check the assumption of the participation of the full cap by some independent means .",
    "non - dipolar magnetic field components have been invoked in the past in various contexts ( arons , 2000 , gil and mitra 2000 ) .",
    "our analysis crucially hinges on the rankin relation , which in turn makes crucial use of the dipole nature of the field .",
    "the existence of non - dipolar components has been studied by arons ( 1993 ) and he has concluded against their presence .",
    "we take the view that the remarkable agreement of the rankin relation actually provides evidence for the dipolar nature of the field and strongly indicates the absence of non - dipolar components and also of propagation effects affecting the core emission .",
    "in so far as our constraints hold , can we then conclude that bpal12 is _ the _ neutron star eos ? actually bpal12 is used as an extreme case for illustrative purpose and can hardly be called a realistic netron star eos ( bombaci 2000 ) . in fact",
    "our present knowledge of the neutron star eos is very far from final .",
    "present theoretical uncertainties in these eos relate to the very high density regime ( @xmath54 ) and are small in terms of pressure . for our constraint , however , these small changes in pressure are significant and can lead to very different radii @xmath19 ( see figs . 2 and 3 in benhar et al .",
    "the best we can do is to glean from the trend which is visible in the eos that include the microphysics in the best possible way , i.e. , those based on relativistic quantum field theory ( salgado et al . , 1994 ,",
    "prakash et al . ,",
    "1997 ) , rather than those in which nucleon interactions are described using potentials ( as in the bpal series ) .",
    "these are the eos in table [ tabl2 ] and none among these theoretically most advanced eos are favored by our constraints .",
    "( this is also true of similar eos described in prakash et al .",
    "1997 ) . extrapolating on this trend",
    "it would seem that no neutron star eos can satisfy the inequality [ e7 ] .",
    "this in turn implies that pulsars are not neutron stars the maximum mass turns out to be @xmath41 , in close agreement with the inequality [ e5 ] . ] and leaves us with the only alternative conceivable at present , that pulsars are strange quark stars .",
    "we discuss this next .",
    "some stars considered so far to be neutron stars have been proposed to be actually strange stars on two counts .",
    "the proposals for her x-1 ( dey et al .",
    "1998 ) , 4u 1820 - 30 ( bombaci , 1997 ) , sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( li et al . , 1999a ) , 4u 1728 - 34 ( li et al . ,",
    "1999b ) are based on the compactness of stars being more than a neutron star can accomodate . from an entirely different viewpoint psr 0943 + 10",
    "has been proposed to be a bare strange star ( xu et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "this last proposal implies that all pulsars showing the phenomenon of drifting subpulses may be bare strange stars .",
    "pulsars being strange stars fits well with our constraints .",
    "whether pulsars are bare strange stars , strange stars with normal crusts or the newly proposed third family of ultra - compact stars ( glendenning and kettner , 2000 ) is difficult to decide at present . for the",
    "relatively better - studied strange stars , the new eos for strange stars give radii @xmath55 as opposed to @xmath56 given by earlier eos based on the mit bag model ( dey et al .",
    "xu et al.(1999 ) propose that pulsars showing the phenomenon of drifting sub - pulses are bare strange stars .",
    "our constraints apply to pulsars showing core emission . however , the core emission and drifting of subpulses which is a property of the conal emission ( rankin , 1993 ; see also xu et al . , 1999 )",
    "are not mutually exclusive .",
    "therefore the proposal that pulsars are bare strange stars can be extended to all pulsars .",
    "many issues , such as differences between bare strange stars and those with normal crusts etc .",
    "remain to be answered , although some answers have been proposed .",
    "we do not repeat here this discussion ( xu et al .",
    ", 1999 , madsen , 1999 ) except to state that our core width constraints are one more independent indication that pulsars are strange stars .",
    "the source sax j1808.4 - 3658 has been proposed to be a strange star on the basis of its compactness . in the analysis of psaltis and chakrabarty ( 1999 )",
    "it was demonstrated that the presence of multipole components relaxes the amount of compactness required , such that the star could be a neutron star . in our analysis also , existence of multipoles ( however _ ad hoc _ ) would dilute our conclusion of pulsars being strange stars .",
    "it thus seems that existence of multipoles or the strange star nature of hitherto considered neutron stars are two mutually exclusive choices . at present",
    "it is very difficult to choose between them .",
    "more work on strange stars may in future elucidate this , but introduction of multipoles brings in so many parameters that how their existence could be proved from observations is unclear .",
    "the multipoles would also rob the rankin relation of its beauty and turn its remarkable observational agreement into a mystery .",
    "in summary , the empirical formula of rankin ( 1990 ) describing the opening angle of the pulsar beam emitting the core emission when compared to theoretically calculated value leads to a constraint that pulsar masses should be @xmath0 and radii @xmath57 .",
    "this comes about due to the inclusion of general relativistic effects of the mass of the star on the pulsar beam size . for",
    "observationally reasonable pulsar masses a comparison with mass - radius relations of neutron star eos shows that most of the eos are ruled out , implying that pulsars are strange stars and not neutron stars , unless our understanding of the neutron star eos is revised .",
