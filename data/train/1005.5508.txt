    "strong evidences from the current cosmological observations such as supernovae type ia(sneia)@xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite and large scale structure(lss)@xcite converge upon the fact that the universe is spatially flat and there exists exotic component , dubbed dark energy , which drives the speed - up expansion of the universe .",
    "many scenarios have been proposed to explain the acceleration in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the preferred and simplest candidate for dark energy is the einstein s cosmological constant which can fit the observations well .",
    "however , it suffers from the so - called fine - tuning problem and coincidence problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the observations are not yet able to confirm that dark energy is indeed a constant .",
    "actually , many dynamical models of dark energy have been studied extensively during the past over ten years , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for a detailed review ) , tachyon @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , etc ( see ref.@xcite for a comprehensive review on dark energy models ) .    gr is a well tested theory in solar system , but it is poorly tested on cosmic scales .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to ask whether the cosmic acceleration is caused by a modified theory of gravity . as is pointed out , the dark energy problem may be essentially an issue of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "although a complete theory of quantum gravity has not been established , some valuable ideas are thought to be the features of the theory of quantum gravity , for example , extra dimensions .",
    "many fundamental theories would induce scalar fields in the usual 4-dimensional space - time , and these scalar fields are in general non - minimal coupled .",
    "it is truly remarkable to find that a candidate scalar field of the desired nature is provided by some fundamental theory . on the other hand , in recent years",
    ", the interest in scalar - tensor theories of gravity as viable alternatives to gr is renewed .",
    "in particular , some authors have resorted to scalar - tensor theory in order to explain the present accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite . as the simplest example and prototype of scalar - tensor theory of gravity , brans - dicke theory ( bd ) formulates the gravitational phenomena through the interplay between the metric tensor and a scalar field @xmath1 that controls the intensity of the gravitational constant @xmath2 , while the coupling between @xmath1 and matter is absent .",
    "although there is no direct support from fundamental theories , it is hard to deny that it appears to provide a small window through which one can look into phenomenological aspects of fundamental theories .",
    "recently , the possibility that fermion fields as gravitational sources could be responsible for accelerated periods during the expansion of the universe is considered in the framework of gr@xcite as well as in bd theory of gravity@xcite . in the context of cosmology , due to the isotropy and homogeneity of the geometry of the universe",
    ", the fermion field configurations should be constant in space .",
    "it is shown that the fermion field could behave as dark energy for late - time universe . in this work ,",
    "we would like to investigate the dynamics of bd cosmology in which there exists fermions with coupling to bd scalar field as well as a self - interaction potential , and the main focus is looking for the conditions under which there is a solution that is stable and represents a late - time accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we briefly introduce the tetrad formalism of fermions with variable mass in brans - dicke theory of gravity .",
    "then , the cosmological dynamics of the model is investigated in detail in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our results and give some discussions .",
    "we start from the dirac lagrangian density in minkowski space - time @xmath3-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi - v,\\ ] ] where the index @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the dirac - pauli matrices , @xmath6 is the fermion mass , @xmath7 denotes the adjoint spinor field and @xmath8 , an exclusive function of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , is the potential representing a fermion self - interaction .",
    "when gravity is taken into account , the generally covariant dirac lagrangian becomes @xmath11-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi - v,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is generalized dirac - pauli matrices , @xmath13 denotes covariant derivatives , which is defined by @xmath14   \\gamma^{\\sigma}\\gamma^{\\lambda},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the christoffel symbol and the tetrad , respectively .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath17 satisfies the relation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the minkowski metric tensor .    in the canonical frame",
    ", the lagrangian for the brans - dicke theory can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scalar curvature and @xmath1 is the brans - dicke scalar field .",
    "@xmath22 in the non - minimal coupling term acts as an effective gravitational constant @xmath23 in such a way that @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that , just as the brans - dicke scalar field @xmath1 adjusts the strength of gravity @xmath2 , the fermion mass @xmath6 is replaced by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "then the lagrangian for the spinor field with variable mass can be written as @xmath11-\\beta\\phi\\bar{\\psi}\\psi - v,\\ ] ] so we will take the following total action @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the lagrangian of matter fields .",
    "varying action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the spinor field , we obtain the dirac equations for the spinor field and its adjoint field @xmath29 @xmath30 similarly , the einstein equations for brans - dicke gravitational dynamics can also be derived from action ( [ action ] ) ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a covariant dlambertian for a scalar field and @xmath33 @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\      & -&g_{\\mu\\nu}l_d.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy momentum tensor for the matter fields is defined as usual , @xmath35 . in cosmology , it is often be expressed as the form of perfect fluid @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are energy density and pressure of the matter , respectively .",
    "the four velocity vector @xmath39 normalized as @xmath40 .",
    "finally , we vary action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath1 , obtaining the equation of motion for the brans - dicke scalar field @xmath41",
    "for a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic universe , the space - time interval is written as usual as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the cosmic scale factor .",
    "therefore , the components of tetrad becomes @xmath44 and the dirac matrices turn out to be @xmath45 from which the covariant derivatives is obtained @xmath46 where and thereafter overdot denotes derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath47 .",
    "then , the dirac equations ( [ dirac1 ] ) and ( [ dirac2 ] ) read @xmath48 @xmath49 and the equations of motion for the metric and the brans - dicke scalar field become @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is hubble parameter and @xmath54 @xmath55 note that , among the equations ( [ feqn1])-([feqn3 ] ) , only two of them are independent and the rest one can be derived from bianchi identity . from eqs.([feqn1])-([feqn3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath56 @xmath57    and @xmath58.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we shall consider a pressureless dust matter field , that is , @xmath59 .",
    "then , from conservation equation for the energy density of the matter constituent , @xmath60 , we can obtain that @xmath61 . in order to analyze the cosmological dynamics",
    ", we should select a specific potential @xmath8 . according to the pauli - fierz theorem",
    ", @xmath8 can be an exclusive function of the scalar invariant @xmath62@xcite . in this work",
    ", we choose @xmath63 as in ref.@xcite , where @xmath64 is a constant and @xmath65 is a real number .",
    "the bilinear @xmath66 is scalar , hereafter we call it @xmath67 . from dirac equations ( [ dirac1a ] ) and ( [ dirac2a ] ) ,",
    "it is not difficult to find that @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is present value of @xmath67 .",
    "let us define some new dimensionless variables @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 as functions of @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , friedmann equation ( [ frw ] ) becomes a constraint equation @xmath75    after a lengthy but straightforward calculations , from eqs.([frw])-([eom : phi ] ) , it is shown that the deceleration parameter @xmath76 can be indicated as @xmath77 where the evolution of @xmath78 satisfies @xmath79,\\ ] ] where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath80 .",
    "on the other hand , according to the definitions of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , as well as the evolutions of @xmath67 and @xmath37 , it is easy to find that @xmath83 @xmath84    the equations ( [ prime : y])-([prime : omegam ] ) constitute an autonomous system and we shall use phase space method to investigate the properties of its solutions qualitatively .",
    "the critical points of the system can be obtained by setting @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in table",
    "[ table ] , all the critical points of the system are listed .",
    "the coordinate of the point d is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath65 , while the points b@xmath88 and c is independent of @xmath65 . as for the coordinates of the other two points a and e , they rely on both of the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath65 . noting that merging occurs for the points d and e for @xmath89 .",
    "all the critical points except c are associated with the dust matter vanishing universe . from eqs.([prime : omegabeta ] ) and ( [ prime : omegam ] ) , it is obvious that plane @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) and plane @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) are two invariant sub - manifold of the @xmath94-dimensional phase space .",
    "this means that there is no orbit in the phase space for which @xmath82 or @xmath81 can be exactly zero .",
    "that is to say , if the initial value of @xmath95 or coupling constant @xmath26 in the definition of @xmath81 is set to be zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fermion field is initially massless , it will remain massless .",
    "the values of @xmath96 and deceleration parameter at the different critical points @xmath97 and @xmath98 are also listed in table [ table ] .    what is more interesting is the stable solution which represents that the universe will undergoes a late - time accelerated expansion phase . to investigate the stability of these critical points ,",
    "we can write the variables near these points @xmath99 in the form @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 with @xmath103 , the perturbations of the variables around the critical points to the first order . this leads to the following equation @xmath104 where the @xmath94-column vector @xmath105 represents the perturbations of the variables and @xmath106 is a constant @xmath107 matrix .",
    "for stability we require all @xmath94 eigenvalues of @xmath106 to be negative .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the eigenvalues of the linear perturbation matrix @xmath106 for the critical points and the stability properties are summarized in table [ table2 ] , while the conditions for a stable and late - time acceleration solution are listed in table [ table3 ] .",
    "it is found that all the critical points but b@xmath108 can be stable for some values of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath65 .",
    "however , the stable solutions presented by d and e can not describe a universe that undergoes a late - time acceleration .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting that only point a allows bd parameter @xmath109 for a stable and late - time accelerated solution .",
    "as is well known , in the limit case @xmath110 , the standard einstein s gr is recovered from the bd theory , except for some special cases , for example , in which the trace of the matter energy - momentum tensor vanishes @xcite . and the solar - system experiments constraint severely that the value of @xmath0 obeys @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "with this understanding , the late - time acceleration of expansion of the universe will be entirely dependent upon the self - interaction of the fermion field as is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] , where the bd parameter is chosen to be @xmath112 , and initial values of @xmath78 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 is set at present ( @xmath113 ) to be @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "we recall that in the standard frw universe containing only single barotropic fluid in the framework of gr , the deceleration parameter @xmath117 and the equation of state of barotropic fluid @xmath118 have a relation @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , from figure [ fig1 ] , we can find that the equation of state of effective dark energy is able to cross the phantom divide @xmath120 for some values of @xmath65 and the big rip may also occur in the future . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the evolution trajectories of relative energy densities @xmath82 , @xmath81 and @xmath96 .",
    "it is not surprising that the energy density of the fermion field will eventually overcome the energy density of the matter field and this occurs roughly at the time the universe going into an accelerated expansion phase , while the energy density contributed by the variable mass of fermion field keeps similar pace with that of the matter field .    on the other hand , if we allow the bd parameter @xmath0 to be less than zero on the cosmological scales , there will exist another two class of stable late - time accelerated expansion solutions which are represented by critical points b@xmath121 and c and illustrated in figure [ fig : bqx ] and figure [ fig : cqx ] , respectively .",
    "these solutions do not determined by the self - interaction of the fermion field , because in these two class of solutions @xmath96 converges towards zero and the parameter @xmath122 .",
    "the solutions illustrated in figure [ fig : bqx ] denote a phantom field dominated universe which will suffer from the fate of big rip .",
    "however , the solutions illustrated in figure [ fig : cqx ] will avoid this violent doom , although the equation of state of effective dark energy under certain conditions may become less than @xmath123 within some period of time .",
    "more interestingly , it is shown in figure [ fig : com ] that , in this class of solutions , the relative energy density of dust matter will not vanish but converge to a reasonable finite value .",

    "brans - dicke theory is a natural alternative and a simple extension of general relativity . in this work ,",
    "we have studied the cosmological dynamics of brans - dicke theory in which there are fermions with a coupling to bd scalar field as well as a self - interaction potential . because of the isotropy and homogeneity of the geometry of the universe , the fermion field is independent of space and becomes an exclusive function of time .",
    "the conditions that there exist solutions which are stable and describe a late - time accelerated expansion of the universe are found .",
    "the variable mass of fermions can not vanish exactly during the evolution of the universe once it obtains initially .",
    "it is shown that the late - time acceleration depends completely on the self - interaction of the fermion field if our investigation is restricted to the theory with positive bd parameter @xmath0 .",
    "provided a negative @xmath0 is allowed , there will be another two class of stable solutions describing late - time accelerated expansion of the universe which are independent of the self - interaction of fermion field .",
    "the strongest constraint to date on the brans - dicke theory of gravity has been put on the solar system scale@xcite , however , it should be pointed out that such constraint does not necessarily apply on scales much larger than those of the measurements , and on epochs much different from the present .",
    "the solar system experiments only probe scales in gravitational equilibrium , where the background expansion of the universe is negligible , therefore , they would not reveal spatial or time variation of the gravitational constant on larger scales . through a certain mechanism ,",
    "the bd parameter @xmath0 becomes variable from small scales to large scales .",
    "it is even not excluded that on the largest scales the gravitational constant becomes effectively negative .",
    "some indications for a negative @xmath0 ( or effectively negative gravitational constant ) have been obtained @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate such a model presented here in the context of a detailed viable gravitational theory with variable effective @xmath0 , for example , the abnormally weighting energy theory @xcite .",
