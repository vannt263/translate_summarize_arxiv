    "there are few predictions made by the standard model ( sm ) that have not yet been observed , most of the times due to experimental difficulties .",
    "one of these non - observed predictions is the so called coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering @xcite . in this process",
    "a neutrino scatters coherently not only the nucleons but the nucleus itself .",
    "the coherent scattering requires momentum transfer , @xmath0 , small compared with the inverse nucleus size , @xmath1 , @xmath2 the nuclear radius .",
    "this condition is well satisfied for almost every typical atom , in the case of neutrino energies coming from reactors , artificial sources , the sun or supernovas .",
    "neglecting radiative corrections the cross section is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of the nucleus , @xmath5 is the recoil nucleus energy , @xmath6 is the incident neutrino energy and the axial and vector couplings are @xmath7 f_{nucl}^v(q^2)\\,,\\\\ g_a&= &   \\left[g_a^p \\left(z_+-z_-\\right)+g_a^n\\left(n_+-n_-\\right)\\right ] f_{nucl}^a(q^2)\\ , .",

    "the vector and axial nuclear form factors , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are usually assumed to be equal and of order of unity in the limit of small energies , @xmath14 .",
    "the sm neutral current vector couplings of neutrinos with protons , @xmath15 , and with neutrons , @xmath16 , are @xmath17 here @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the radiative corrections given by the pdg  @xcite .",
    "the axial contribution can be neglected as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ diff : cross : sect ] ) since the ratio of axial to vector contribution is expected to be of the order @xmath24 , @xmath25 the atomic number .",

    "one can see that the maximum nuclei s recoil energy depends on nucleus mass @xmath4 through the relation @xmath35 .",
    "this is the biggest experimental challenge to defeat in order to detect this process .",
    "for example , reactor neutrino with @xmath36mev produces a maximum nucleus recoil for germanium of @xmath37kev .",
    "nevertheless , experiments that look for direct dark matter searches have improved the detectors at very low threshold .",
    "different proposals have been suggested to detect the coherent @xmath38 scattering that differs each other depending on the neutrino source and the detector properties .",
