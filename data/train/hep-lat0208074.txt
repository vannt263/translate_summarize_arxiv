    "the colour confinement in qcd can be formulated as an absence of coloured asymptotic states in the brst formalism , and the presence of long - range @xmath3 correlation between colour sources . in the gribov - zwanziger s theory of landau gauge qcd@xcite",
    ", the long - range correlation is attributed to the ghost propagator , i.e. the inverse of the faddeev - popov(fp ) matrix .",
    "the ghost propagator is more singular and the gluon propagator is less singular than the tree level in the infrared region .    in kugo - ojima s theory@xcite",
    ", a sufficient condition for an absence of coloured asymptotic states is that the parameter @xmath4 defined by the two - point function of the fp ghost fields , @xmath5 , and @xmath6@xcite , satisfies @xmath7 .",

    "@xmath14 depends on the options of the definition of gauge field , @xmath15-linear or @xmath16 type ;    @xmath15-linear : @xmath17    @xmath16 : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "one can show that in the core region@xcite , the horizon function @xmath10 is negative and in the infinite volume limit @xmath21 which is called horizon condition .",
    "zwanziger showed in his lattice formulation that the ghost self - energy cancels precisely the zero - th order @xmath22 term and the ghost propagator behaves as @xmath3 in the infrared asymptotic region provided no additional non - perturbative effect is involved @xcite .",
    "recent results of dyson - schwinger approach suggest the nonperturbative aspects are in effect .",

    "thus kugo - ojima condition leads to the same singular behavior as zwanziger s , and derives the universal renormalizaiton factors as @xmath26    putting kugo - ojima parameter as @xmath27 one finds that the horizon condition is written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "thus one sees that both the above arguments appear to be consistent with each other provided the lattice covariant derivative meets with the continuum one in the naive sense , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "kugo discussed in his lecture@xcite that the colour confinement can be realized via either ( 1 ) @xmath32 and @xmath33finite or ( 2 ) @xmath34 but / and @xmath35    zwanziger@xcite argues that the second possibility is realized in the su(2 ) colour case .",
    "our numerical results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we obtained that @xmath36 is consistent to @xmath37 in @xmath38 quenched simulation , @xmath39 , on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in the case of @xmath40 on @xmath1 ,",
    "the value of @xmath41 becomes closer to 1 , but @xmath42 becomes larger as compared to those of @xmath43 , and thus @xmath44 becomes smaller .",
    "we need to perform larger lattice simulation to approach the continuum limit .",
    "we measured gluon propagator of @xmath43 on lattice @xmath45 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and observed clear tendency of the infrared suppression in the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "[ gh32l ]    [ alp32 ]    the ghost propagator is infrared divergent and its singularity can be parametrised as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 . in the @xmath1 lattice ,",
    "the overall scale difference in the @xmath16 and @xmath49linear versions disappear in gluon propagator , but it still remains in ghost propagator .",
    "the gluon propagator and the ghost propagator are evaluated also from dyson - schwinger approach@xcite .",
    "they found qualitatively similar solutions for dressing functions of the gluon and the ghost , @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54@xcite .",
    "the gluon propagator vanishes at @xmath55 momentum if @xmath56 .",
    "our lattice simulation of the ghost dressing function @xmath57 shows that the value @xmath58 remains unchanged at @xmath59 of the dyson - schwinger one through @xmath45 to @xmath1 simulations .",
    "the negative @xmath60 appears in @xmath0 lattice and @xmath61 in @xmath1 lattice .",
    "we observe the tendency that @xmath62 increases as the lattice size increases , but our data still stays about @xmath59 of the prediction of the dyson - schwinger approach .",
    "in contrast to the first data of the ghost propagator@xcite , suppression at the lowest momentum is not seen in our data of the ghost propagator . for calculation of the ghost propagator , we adopted the multigrid poisson solver whose accuracy was kept within @xmath63 , and we set 1% as an ending condition of perturbative calculation of the inverse fp operator .",
    "the landau gauge accuracy of @xmath64 is @xmath65 in maximum norm .    using the ghost and gluon dressing function",
    ", the running coupling can be evaluated from @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the lattice spacing . in the case of @xmath68 , which has the smallest @xmath42 , the suppression of the gluon dressing function due to the loss of correlation of the gluon field and the enhancement of the ghost dressing function cancel .",
    "we find @xmath69 near the lowest momentum point and @xmath2 .",
    "the infrared suppression of the running coupling measured from the three point function of gluon@xcite and from the ghost - antighost gluon@xcite in @xmath70 scheme would be attributed to the loss of correlation of gluon fields .",
    "in the @xmath68 lattice simulation @xmath42 is about 0.15 and we need extrapolation to @xmath71 .",
    "there remain finite size effects in ghost propagator in @xmath1 lattice , and also in the kugo - ojima parameter which manifest themselves in their dependence on the definition of the gauge field .",
    "the continuum limit should not depend on the definition of the gauge field and so a systematic method for extrapolating the continuum limit of c in the two definitions is necessary .",
