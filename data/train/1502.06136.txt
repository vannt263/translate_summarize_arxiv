    "spatial mixing , or the decay of correlations between spins in a spin system , is a fundamental question of interest in statistical physics . it is intimately related to temporal mixing for the corresponding glauber dynamics markov chain , which means fast convergence to its equilibrium distribution .",
    "there are two flavors of spatial mixing : strong and weak ( see section  [ sec : wsm - ssm - prelims ] for definitions . ) for our purposes , weak spatial mixing is equivalent to gibbs uniqueness , another fundamental concept from statistical physics .",
    "the hard core model defines a distribution over the independent sets of a graph @xmath12 in terms of a fugacity @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath12 is finite and @xmath14 , this is the uniform distribution .",
    "more generally , an independent set @xmath15 has a probability proportional to @xmath16 , so that when @xmath17 , the distribution is biased towards larger independent sets , and when @xmath18 , it is biased towards smaller ones . by convention , when @xmath19 , the conditional distribution on finite subgraphs is uniform over all independent sets of maximum size .    in computer science , the problem of sampling from this distribution when @xmath14 is well - known to be poly - time equivalent to the problem of approximately counting the independent sets of a graph , which is known to be a hard problem in general .",
    "we refer the reader to recent work by sly and sun  @xcite for further hardness results .    a seminal paper of d. weitz  @xcite found that the infinite regular @xmath2-ary tree has the same threshold for weak and strong spatial mixing , namely @xmath20 .",
    "more importantly , this is a worst case : every other graph of maximum degree @xmath21 also exhibits wsm and ssm for all @xmath0 up to the aforementioned threshold . at the time , this established the strongest positive results for spatial mixing for a wide variety of graphs , including , for instance , the square grid .",
    "brightwell , hgrstrm and winkler  @xcite showed that there are graphs , even trees , for which the property of wsm is non - monotone as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "that is , increasing @xmath0 can actually _ decrease _ the extent to which correlations travel over long distances , and so wsm holds at sufficiently small and sufficiently large @xmath0 , but not in between .",
    "they even give a more complicated construction ( not a tree ) for which the hard - core model exhibits wsm iff @xmath22 \\cup [ \\lambda_2 , \\lambda_3]$ ] where @xmath23 .",

    "@xcite showed that for some graphs , such as the planar square lattice , ssm occurs at higher @xmath0 than for the @xmath24-regular tree .",
    "recently , vera , vigoda and yang  @xcite have shown that the tree of self - avoiding walks on the square lattice contains a subtree which has wsm but not ssm , at a still higher value of @xmath0 , but still below the conjectured critical value for the square lattice .",
    "( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemmas 4 , 7 ) . )",
    "this suggests that it may not be such an uncommon phenomenon for wsm to occur without ssm . in section  [ sec : alternating ] we exhibit an example of an infinite tree which has wsm for all @xmath25 but does not have ssm for any @xmath26 .",
    "we consider random poisson trees , in which every vertex has an independent , identically poisson distributed number of children .",
    "this is a natural model because of its connection to sparse erds - rnyi random graphs , @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for large @xmath30 , the local structure of balls of volume @xmath31 is well approximated by a poisson tree .",
    "it is natural , given an infinite graph , to consider the following threshold conjecture : there is a threshold @xmath32 such that wsm holds if and only if @xmath33 . the analogous conjecture with ssm in place of wsm is also interesting . for instance",
    ", both conjectures are known to be true with @xmath34 when @xmath12 is the infinite regular @xmath35-ary tree .",

    "understanding weak spatial mixing for regular @xmath2-ary trees is relatively straightforward .",
    "note that , in general , the conditional probability @xmath38 that node @xmath39 is unoccupied , given that the parent of @xmath39 is unoccupied , obeys the recurrence    m0.5 in m5 in   & @xmath40    where @xmath41 ranges over the children of @xmath39 . since for the @xmath2-regular tree all the @xmath42 are equal , the problem boils down to understanding the stability of the fixed point of the iterated function @xmath43 .",
    "for random poisson trees , the situation is more complicated .",
    "since the various subtrees of a node are no longer identical , but merely identically _ distributed _ , we now need to , in effect , consider a recurrence relation on _ distributions _ rather than on real values .",
    "intuitively , we may expect a @xmath8 tree to behave something like a regular @xmath2-ary tree .",
    "we show that this is the case for large @xmath2 , proving that wsm holds for @xmath44 if @xmath45 but not if @xmath46 . on the other hand , for small @xmath2 ,",
    "there are several ways in which this is not the case . in particular ,    1 .",
    "there are some settings of the poisson parameter and fugacity for which there is weak mixing ( almost surely ) but not strong mixing ( with positive probability ) .",
    "in particular , this happens when the expected degree is @xmath47 and the fugacity is sufficiently large .",
