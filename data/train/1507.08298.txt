    "comparison of the factor @xmath30 in serfling s bound to the factor @xmath31 in suggests the following question : can serfling s bound be improved to @xmath32 in general , or at least in the special case of the hypergeometric distribution ?    to date , the improvement conjectured in has not been obtained .",
    "for the special case of the hypergeometric , hush and scovel derived the following bound by extending an argument given by vapnik .",

    "see @xcite for additional discussion .",
    "( * bardenet and maillard * @xcite ) suppose @xmath33 .",
    "then for all @xmath15 and @xmath36 we have @xmath37    we will justify the special consideration given to the hypergeometric distribution relative to the goal of obtaining by adapting a result of kemperman @xcite to derive a convex order between samples without replacement from populations consisting of elements in @xmath38 $ ] and the hypergeometric distribution .",
    "we will then demonstrate how one may use this convex order to obtain exponential bounds for the more general problem of sampling without replacement from a bounded , finite population .",
    "in doing so , we return to the setting of serfling . in this setting",
    "we will consider the variance of the population as well . anticipating this",
    ", we conclude the introduction with a specialization of a bound of bardenet and maillard which incorporates information about the population variance into the bound .",

    "binomial distributions arise when sampling with replacement from a population consisting only of @xmath23 s and @xmath21 s . as we saw in the introduction , hypergeometric distributions",
    "arise when sampling without replacement from such populations .",
    "intuitively , sampling without replacement is more informative than sampling with replacement : when items are not replaced , eventually , when @xmath44 , the entire population is sampled .",
    "this being the case , it is natural to guess that upper bounds which apply to binomial tail probabilities will also apply to the hypergeometric tail probabilities .",
    "hoeffding @xcite proved that this guess is true for exponential bounds derived via the cramr - chernoff method .",
    "this is because a convex order exists between samples with and without replacement ( hoeffding proves this order in his theorem 4 ) .",
    "convex orders between a variety of sampling plans were subsequently explored by kemperman @xcite and karlin @xcite .",
    "note that by ehm ( theorem 2 @xcite ; see also holmes , theorem 3.2 @xcite ) , the total variation distance between the hypergeometric distribution @xmath45 and the binomial distribution @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 so we expect that the binomial bounds will be essentially optimal when @xmath48 .    here",
    "we are interested in sampling scenarios in which @xmath49 . given the similarity in scenarios that produce binomial and hypergeometric probabilities , one might expect that the binomial exponential bounds provide a clue to the form that hypergeometric exponential bounds will take : hypergeometric bounds look like binomial bounds , with a finite sampling correction factor included .",
    "indeed , this is the case when we compare the bound of serfling to hoeffding s uniform bound ( theorem 2.1 @xcite ) , since the only difference between the two is the quantity @xmath50 .",

    "for @xmath101 .",

    "note that if @xmath105 with @xmath106 fixed , yields a slight improvement of , the bound of len and perron , since it contains a quartic term in the exponential .",

    "however , for such @xmath112 the increase in magnitude is compensated for by the @xmath109 term appearing in the exponent .",
