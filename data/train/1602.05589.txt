    "the radiation from the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is primarily emitted in the x - ray band , making x - ray spectroscopy a prime tool for studying this region .",
    "moreover , the variability of the radiation can provide additional diagnostics .",
    "flux and spectral variations in agn are usually nothing out of the ordinary .",
    "the drivers and nature of this variability are known to depend on the timescale of the variability .",
    "for example , changes in the accretion rate govern the longest timescales , and lead the continuum to become softer when brighter in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "absorption changes can drive strong variability , with timescales and spectral signatures that depend on the type of absorber .",
    "in general , all timescales depend on the black hole mass ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , where the timescales are longer with increasing black hole mass .    in this light",
    ", the x - ray spectral variability of fairall  9 stands out .",
    "this luminous seyfert 1 galaxy ( @xmath0 ) , which has been well - studied throughout the years , is renowned for its lack of a warm absorber @xcite and its simple x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is well described by a powerlaw continuum with cold and ionized reflection @xcite , possibly with an additional soft x - ray continuum component @xcite . in particular , from a multi - epoch spectral analysis including _ xmm _ data from 2009 and _ suzaku _ data from 2007 and 2010 , @xcite conclude that the spectral modeling of the soft excess is ambiguous .",
    "both a multi - zone ionized reflection model and a model with an additional comptonization component with a single zone ionized reflector describe the data .",
    "the accretion disk parameters are dependent on the model chosen . for example",
    "the black hole spin is determined to be @xmath1 for a reflection - only soft excess and @xmath2 for a comptonization soft excess .",
    "the high black hole mass of @xmath3 @xcite suggests low amplitude short - term variability , and indeed the source does not display strong intra - observation variability on hour to day timescales @xcite .",
    "the discovery of surprisingly rapid x - ray flux dips in 10years of _ rxte _ monitoring however has put this picture of low amplitude variations on short timescales into question @xcite . during a dip the 2 - 10kev flux decreases by a factor of two or more .",
    "these flux dips happen on a timescale of a few days , so slightly longer than the length of a typical long x - ray observation . while it was not possible to determine the reason for the flux dips from the _ rxte _ monitoring , several possibilities",
    "have been suggested : inner disk or coronal instabilities , absorption from compton - thick clumps in the torus , or even a failed jet cycle .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the broad - band spectral shape and the nature of the soft x - ray excess in fairall  9 .",
    "to do so we have obtained new high quality _ xmm _ ccd observations combined with _",
    "nustar _ hard x - ray coverage targeted at answering these questions . in this paper",
    "we present a spectral analysis of these data .",
    "a future paper will discuss the variability and timing properties .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way ; in  [ reduction ] we discuss the data reduction followed by a description of the results from the spectral analysis in  [ results ] . before finally discussing the results (  [ discuss ] )",
    ", we briefly show in  [ previous ] how our new insights are consistent with the spectra already presented in @xcite .",
    "to learn more about the x - ray flux dips , we designed an observing campaign to provide a detailed spectral and temporal study of the source .",
    "it consists of three parts , starting with a _ swift _ @xcite monitoring campaign to observe fairall  9 in the optical , uv , and x - ray bands for several months in 2013 and 2014 with an average cadence of 2-days to search for dips .",
    "the earliest part of this monitoring which ranged from april to june 2013 was presented in @xcite . in that study we focused on the connection of the x - ray variability to the uv variability and found correlated optical / uv variability on all time scales sampled .",
    "we reduced the newly added data in a similar fashion to that from the pilot study .",
    "the resulting x - ray light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ light_f9 ] .",
    "the dips are immediately apparent in a visual analysis of the x - ray light curve ( fig .",
    "[ light_f9 ] ) . based on this monitoring ,",
    "we triggered two _ xmm _ observations , one in a dip and one out of a dip constituting the second part of our campaign .",
    "these observations are indicated as vertical red bars in the light curve .",
    "the third part of our campaign ( indicated by the third red bar in the light curve ) corresponds to a joint _ xmm_-_nustar _ observation meant to reveal the exact broad - band spectral shape of fairall  9 .",
    "this observation was also taken at high flux , although not as high as the non - dip observation .",
    "the flux variability is also apparent from the unfolded _ xmm _",
    "spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra_unfolded ] . with three observations taken at different flux states , we have a dataset that is well - suited to study possible flux - related spectral changes .",
    "erg / s/@xmath4 indicating the flux state of the three newest _ xmm _ observations ( xmmc , xmmd , xmme ) as red bars .",
    "it is apparent that xmmc was taken at very low flux , while xmmd and xmme were at high flux . ]",
    "fairall  9 is a well - studied agn ; an overview of the existing data from _ xmm _ , _ suzaku _ and _ nustar _ is given in table  [ nu_obs ] . throughout the paper , reference names are used for all the pointings .",
    "this work focuses on the newest three _ xmm _ observations ( xmmc , xmmd , xmme ) and the _ nustar _ observation ( taken in the form of two immediately subsequent pointings ) simultaneous with xmme , i.e. parts two and three of our observing campaign described in the previous section .",
    "part one will be presented together with an analysis of the temporal properties in a furthcoming paper .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the results presented thus far are based on observations taken over a period of less than one year ( table  [ nu_obs ] ) , while the observations considered in previous works spanned a period from 2000 to 2010 . changes to the geometry of the source are plausible over a several year period .",
    "these changes might cause the flux ratios to the continuum to vary .",
    "further , we also note the different sensitivities of the different satellites leads to a different average power law fitted to even the same band , which would affect the data / model residual plots as well .",
    "therefore , instead of trying to make a comparable plot for the old data we simply try to fit the suza , suzb , and xmmb observations jointly in a similar fashion to the xmmc , xmmd , and xmme / nu observations to test whether the data have similar properties . for ease of fitting , we combine the two front - illuminated _ suzaku _ xis detectors .",
    "we include the power law soft excess in our model , as it was already seen as a possibility for the soft excess when the same observations were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "however it was already noted then that the soft x - ray energies of _ suzaku_-xis might not be very reliable because of contamination on the detector . to avoid this affecting our general conclusion about the spectra , we exclude all _ suzaku _ data below 1kev for the spectral modeling . the high energy cut - off is kept fixed at 1000kev , as it can not be determined from _ suzaku_-pin .",
    "we find that a model similar to that described in section [ soft ] describes the old data reasonably well ( @xmath5 for 5386 dof ) , see fig .",
    "[ residuals_previous ] .",
    "in particular such a fit returns very similar best fit parameters ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) to the fit to the newer data .",
    "the spin and inclination measurements are in agreement with those found in section  [ soft ] .",
    "this implies that the source behavior remained mostly unchanged over the last 7 years",
    ".     found to fit the new _ xmm _ and _ nustar _ data .",
    "the residuals below 1kev are consistent with the calibration uncertainity of _ xmm _ epic - pn . ]",
    "in this paper we have studied three _ xmm _ observations of fairall  9 taken in 2013/2014 and one _ nustar _ observation in the same time period .",
    "our main findings are :    * we are able to confirm the absence of excess ionized or neutral absorption in the soft x - ray band .",
    "we detect emission lines in the soft band , as well as a single absorption line at 21.7 that can not be associated with fairall  9 . *",
    "we discover fractional residuals to a simple power law in the _ xmm _ band , which remain constant even as the source flux changes significantly .",
    "this implies a constant fractional contribution from the different model components . *",
    "we clearly detect blurred ionized reflection in the spectrum and are able to constrain the accretion disk parameters . * a soft excess additional to that due to blurred ionized reflection , described by an additional power law component is present .",
    "in section [ rgs_data ] we noted that there is a noticeable absorption line at 21.7 , which agrees most closely with the ovii resonance line at 21.6 .",
    "the hot phase of the interstellar medium is known to produce prominent ovii absorption lines ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . however , assuming the line is produced by ovii absorption , it would have a velocity shift of @xmath8kms@xmath9 , which is beyond any velocity range in the galaxy , including high velocity clouds ( @xmath10kms@xmath9 ) , or uncertainties due to errors in the rgs absolute wavelength scale ( typically 0.004 or @xmath11kms@xmath9 ) .",
    "the most likely and appealing origin of this feature is therefore the intergalactic medium lying in the line of sight towards fairall9 .    assuming that the absorption feature detected at @xmath12 at 21.7 is produced by ovii",
    ", this would correspond to @xmath13@xmath14 at @xmath15 . in general ,",
    "the best indicator for igm absorption is the redshifted hi ly@xmath16 absorption line ( 1215.67 at rest ) , which is commonly found in fuv spectra of agn , including fairall9 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the redshift of our putative ovii feature is consistent with the hi absorption line redshifted to 1221 clearly seen in the hi ly@xmath16 profile of fairall9 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.10 ) .",
    "the 21.7 line is therefore most likely of intergalactic origin .      from the rgs spectra ,",
    "we confirm the absence of any significant absorption other than galactic , as noted previously by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , we see a set of low energy emission lines including those consistent with o vii , o viii , and n vii . plotting the flux of these lines against the ionization state ( figure  [ fig : xi_vs_flux ] ) indicates that the ionization state of most of the gas is around @xmath17 .",
    "such low ionization emission lines are consistent with a warm absorber out of our line of sight . within the context of the unified agn model ,",
    "this agrees well with our finding that the inclination of the inner accretion disk , as measured from the multi - epoch spectra , is very low and the accretion disk is almost face - on .",
    "previous measurements of the inclination angle have found it to be more intermediate @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy could could be due to that earlier analyses have used an angle averaged reflection model , which the analysis presented here uses the new angle - resolved ` relxill ` model @xcite .",
    "for very low inclinations and intermediate ionization states such as found here , the differences between an angle - averaged and angle - resolved model are especially pronounced ( see figure  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as we showed in section[previous",
    "] , a reanalysis of the old data with the new ` relxill ` model now also finds a low inclination .",
    "a second complication of the inclination measurement already discussed in @xcite , is that for intermediate inclinations ( @xmath1845deg ) the cut - off of the blue wing of the iron line , which provides the best constraint on the inclination of the accretion disk , coincides with the fe k@xmath19 line , possibly leading to a false association of this energy as the end of the blue wing of the line .",
    "the exact modeling of the highly ionized emission lines ( fe xxv , fexxvi ) adds additional complexity to this region of the spectrum .",
    "future high - resolution observations with , for example , the microcalorimeter on board _ astro - h _ , have the potential to answer this question once and for all .          in our initial exploration of the x - ray spectrum ( section [ res_ccd ] ) we discovered that the data / model residuals of an absorbed power law , with the absorption fixed at the galactic value , are very similar for all three _ xmm _ pointings ( fig .  [ resid_powerlaw ] ) .",
    "a similar observation has been made by @xcite in mrk335 where the soft excess component at 0.6kev was found to scale with the flux , yielding a constant flux ratio",
    ". however , the persistence of the fractional flux contributions is much more apparent in fairall  9 .",
    "this is most likely driven by the high black hole mass of fairall  9 and its aborption - free spectrum , simplifying a detection significantly .",
    "the observed behavior has several implications for our understanding the x - ray spectra and spectral variability .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the relative contribution of each individual model component at a given energy remains constant .",
    "the number and nature of the components also remains the same .",
    "this implies that , the geometry of the x - ray emitting region can not have changed within the time spanned by the observations .",
    "indirectly , the accretion rate must remain approximately constant as drastic changes in the accretion rate would cause changes in the geometry .    to gain further insight into the geometry , we model the simultaneous observations xmme and nu above 2kev ( to avoid the complications of the soft excess ) with a lamp - post geometry and @xmath20 were kept fixed at their multi - epoch best fit values . ] , where the corona is approximated by a point source above the disk at heigh @xmath21 .",
    "we find that the corona would be at a height of @xmath22 above the accretion disk .",
    "the time difference ( @xmath1810days ) between the two observations xmmc and xmmd combined with the fact that we do not see a significant lag of the cold reflection flux behind the continuum flux , allows us to place an upper limit on the distance to the cold reflector of 690@xmath23 .",
    "this indicates that the origin of the cold reflection is the outer part of the accretion disk and not a more distant structure such as the torus .",
    "a radius of @xmath24 lies well within the dust sublimation radius of fairall  9 ( @xmath25 ) and our finding therefore agrees well the claim of @xcite that the dust sublimation radius represents an upper limit to iron emitting region .",
    "having set out in this paper to find the driver of the relatively rapid variability seen in the x - ray monitorings of fairall  9 , the question now is : what is causing the variability we observe in the x - ray spectra of this agn ? from our results , it is clear that the variability of the individual components is driven by the variability of the continuum ( power law ) .",
    "both the cold and the ionized reflection components respond to these changes in the continuum , as does the soft excess .",
    "the question of the nature of the variability is therefore transferred to the question of what causes the continuum variability .",
    "current models connect the continuum variability to changes of the accretion flow @xcite , for example through inward propagating fluctuations of the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "but to fully understand how these accretion flow changes are connected to changes in the coronal emission will require a better understanding of the detailed physics governing the corona .      our detailed spectral analysis of the multi - epoch data revealed an additional continuum - like component in the spectra above the blurred reflection . in section",
    "[ soft ] we found that a simple , steep power law describes this component well .",
    "this component varies together with the bulk of the continuum emission . its strength with respect to the primary continuum does not change , similar to what is seen for the reflection components .",
    "the spectral shape and variability behavior ( it must vary on relatively fast time scales , which are shorter than the time difference between the observations ) suggest that comptonization could give rise to the observed power law .",
    "one possibility is that the primary corona is non - uniform in its temperature or optical depth and this gives rise to two seemingly distinct but coordinated varying components . one plausible explanation for this would be in - homogeneous heating of the corona as , for example , caused by different magnetic field strengths at different radii .",
    "another possibility is that this comptonization occurs in an area that is spatially separate from the primary comptonization , e.g. on the surface of the innermost part of the accretion disk .",
    "the need for an additional comptonization component to model the broad - band _ xmm _ and _ nustar _ spectra has also been found in ark120 @xcite , and ngc5548 @xcite .",
    "both analyses assume the two comptonization components are coupled , with the first corona upscattering the accretion disk photons and the second corona comptonizing the already comptonized photons leaving the first corona .",
    "such a scenario was outlined in @xcite .",
    "two spatially separate but connected comptonization components , however would be problematic for the case of fairall  9 . to match the observed constancy of the flux ratios , for example , a doubling in the flux output of the first corona would need to lead to a doubling of the flux output of the second corona as well .",
    "a doubling in the seed photon flux however does usually not lead to a doubling of the coronal emission ; in fact it would lead to a significant cooling of the second corona .",
    "the only way to ensure the flux ratios remain constant , would be a fine - tuned heating of the second / primary corona .",
    "therefore for fairall  9 a non - uniform corona is more likely .",
    "it is important to note here that a separate comptonization component in the soft x - ray would naturally also extend into the uv / optical bands .",
    "this provides another means of verifying the presence of an additional component , as a single temperature comptonization component extending from the optical to the soft x - rays would predict a significant correlation of the bands at zero lag .",
    "this is called into question by the discovery of notable lags between the x - ray emission and the uv / optical bands @xcite .",
    "notably these lags are seen between all x - ray energies and the uv / optical emission , not just the soft x - rays , with no strong correlation seen at zero lag .",
    "usually these lags are associated with the thermal reprocessing of x - ray coronal emission on the optical / uv emitting regions of the accretion disk .",
    "possibly , multi - zone comptonization , for example on the outer layers of the accretion disk ( with multiple temperatures ) could mimic a similar effect .    for fairall  9",
    "previous work also suggests the presence of thermal reprocessing in uv / optical @xcite . we will discuss the timing and uv - x - ray insights from the new data in a forthcoming paper",
