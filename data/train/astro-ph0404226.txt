    "the color gradients of early type galaxies have been known for quite a long time ( de vaucouleurs 1961 ; boroson , thompson & shectman 1983 ) .",
    "such gradients are believed to be due to the variation of the properties of the underlying stellar population , such as age and metallicity .",
    "theoretically , radial variations in metallicity are expected in some formation scenarios for early - type galaxies .",
    "for example , early simulations of the monolithic collapse of a gas cloud tended to predict metallicity gradients that are too steep to match observations ( e.g. larson 1974 ; carlberg 1984 ) .",
    "later simulations based on mergers of gas - rich galaxies predict that interactions between merging galaxies can effectively dampen their metallicity gradients ( e.g. white 1980 ; kobayashi 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , radial age gradients are also theoretically conceivable",
    ". therefore , detailed color gradient data are essential to discriminate different formation models of early - type galaxies .",
    "spectroscopic indices are the most commonly used indicators of metallicity in early - type galaxies .",
    "earlier measurements indicate the existence of systematic metallicity gradients at the level @xmath6 to @xmath7 ( baum , thomsen , & morgan 1986 ; carollo , danziger , and buson 1993 ; davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 ; henry & worthey 1999 ; mehlert et al . 2000 and 2003 ) . however , it is not easy to obtain a large sample using this technique , because of the difficulties associated with observing long - slit ( two - dimensional ) spectra .",
    "in addition , the rapid decrease of surface brightness with radius limits the radial range over which accurate spectroscopic measurements can be obtained .",
    "such measurements are usually possible only out to a radius of about one or two effective radius , making it difficult to study gradients in the outer part of early - type galaxies .    on the other hand , broad band surface photometry with ccd is relatively easy to expand the measurements to several effective radius .",
    "furthermore , radial profiles obtained from surface photometry are an average measurement within an isophotic annulus , and so are a better representation of the average properties at a given radius . with modern telescopes , accurate multi - waveband photometry can be obtained with little difficulty for a large number of galaxies , making it possible to study the gradients of the stellar population in a statistical way . because of these reasons , photometric measurements are also widely used for studying the metallicity and age gradients in early - type galaxies , although the interpretation of such measurements has to contend with the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy ( e.g. worthey 1994 ) .",
    "early analyses of nearby galaxies in optical bands all indicated that early - type galaxies have systematic color gradients ( boroson , thompson , & shectman 1983 ; davis et .",
    "al . 1985 ; cohen 1986 ; franx , illingworth , & heckman 1989 ; peletier et al . 1990 ; michard 1999 ; scodeggio 2001 ; idiart , michard , & de freitas pacheco 2002 ) .",
    "this is supported by the more recent analysis of the surface photometry of e / s0 galaxies in the nearby rich cluster abell 2199 by tamura & ohta ( 2003 ) .",
    "because of the age - metallicity degeneracy , the observed color gradients are usually interpreted either as the metallicity gradients or the age gradients , assuming the gradients of the other quantity is known . assuming the age of the stellar population to be the same over an entire galaxy , both peletier , valentijn , & jameson ( 1990 ) and idiart , michard , & de freitas pacheco ( 2003 ) obtained a metallicity gradient of @xmath8 ( in terms of @xmath9 ) . under the same assumption ,",
    "tamura & ohta ( 2003 ) found an average metallicity gradient of @xmath10 from a sample of 40 galaxies in abell 2199 and 11 galaxies in abell 2634 . using stellar population synthesis models , saglia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) examined the origin of the observed color gradients by comparing the 20 brightest early - type galaxies in cl0949 + 44 , a cluster at a redshift of @xmath11 taken from hst wf2 frames , with local galaxies .",
    "they concluded that their results are better explained in terms of passive evolution of metallicity gradients than pure age gradients .",
    "hinkley & i m ( 2001 ) investigated the optical and near - infrared color gradients in the hst wfpc2 and nicmos images for six field early - type galaxies with redshifts from 0.4 to 1.0 . by comparing with stellar synthesis models",
    ", they found that 5 out of the 6 galaxies show negligible age gradients and are dominated by a metallicity gradient .",
    "similarly , mehlert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found nearly zero age gradients in 35 early - type galaxies in the coma cluster .",
    "however , silva & elston ( 1994 ) investigated both the optical and near - infrared color gradients in eight early - type galaxies and found that all of them show both metallicity and age gradients . therefore , whether the color gradients can be ascribed to pure metallicity gradients is still controversial .    as pointed out by de jong ( 1996 ; see also cardiel et al .",
    "2003 ; macarthur et al .",
    "2004 ) , the age - metallicity degeneracy may be partially broken by adding infrared photometry to the optical colors . including infrared data",
    "also has another advantage , since contamination by dust is expected to be less important in infrared than in optical .",
    "thus , accurate near infrared photometry are extremely useful in studying stellar population gradients in galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we use the broad band photometry obtained by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) in the optical , together with the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) photometric data in the near - infrared , to study the color gradients for nearby early - type galaxies .",
    "the relative high image quality in both the sdss and 2mass surveys makes it possible to trace the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to the outer part of individual galaxies .",
    "in addition , since the combined sdss and 2mass data give a uniform coverage of the seds over a large wavelength range , we may hope to use such data to derive stringent constraints on the variations of the stellar populations in early - type galaxies . as we will show , although 2mass images are shallower and have lower resolution than the sdss images , the s / n is sufficient for probing the color gradients to more than 2 effective radii .",
    "in this paper , we present results based on 36 early - type galaxies .",
    "although this sample is not larger than those used in early analyses , this is the first time where seds from both optical and near infrared are used to study the stellar population gradients .",
    "as we will see , the results we obtain are in good agreement with those obtained from line indices measurements , which demonstrates the strength of combining optical and near infrared photometry in constraining the stellar population gradients in early - type galaxies . in the future ,",
    "much larger samples can be obtained , making this approach a very promising one for such study .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe our galaxy sample and related data reduction in section  [ sec data ] . in sections  [ sec color - gra ] and  [ sec gradient of a - m ]",
    "we examine the color gradients of these galaxies , and use stellar population synthesis models to obtain constraints on their age and metallicity gradients .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ sec discussion ] and give a summary of our results in section  [ sec summary ] . except where stated otherwise",

    "2002 ) of the sdss , which covers about 462 deg@xmath13 of the sky .",
    "nearby galaxies that are brighter than 13.5 magnitude in the @xmath14-band were selected , which guarantees that all the sample galaxies are bright and large enough to be measured in their outer regions in all sdss and 2mass bands . since one of the main goals of this work was to use broad - band photometry to disentangle the age - metallicity effects in observed color gradients ,",
    "accurate photometric measurements are required .",
    "total 36 early - type galaxies of e and s0 type were selected out .",
    "most of the morphological types were obtained from the literature ( rc3 of de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ; nasa / ipac extragalactic database ; nakamura et al .",
    "the remaining galaxies were classified with morphological types by inspecting their sdss images and radial profiles . since",
    "no other selection criteria were used except the above mentioned magnitude limit , the sample is roughly a magnitude - limited unbiased sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "all the galaxies have absolute @xmath15 magnitudes between -19 and -23 with the narrow @xmath16 color range of 0.9 to 1.1 .",

    "the astrometric solutions for all the five bands were obtained from the astrometric pipeline ( astrom ) with typical errors much smaller than @xmath43 ( stoughton et al .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of 2mass is better than @xmath44 ( cutri et al .",
    "thus the images in any 2 bands of the sdss and 2mass could be matched very well .",
    "although the images from the sdss archive were processed with photometric corrections , some spurious features were still present in many image frames , especially in the @xmath18 and @xmath20 bands .",
    "the spatial variation of these features was about 1 to 2 adu .",
    "for galaxies which happen to be located in such features , the variation was found to affect both background subtraction and the measurement of color profiles in the outer parts of the image , where the surface brightness is low .",
    "fortunately , most of these features were only one dimensional , and the variation was only along horizontal lines .",
    "thus it was not difficult to measure and then pick them out from images . to do this ,",
    "firstly a region was selected that includes several hundred lines , covers all columns but does not contain any bright objects .",
    "the median of these lines was then measured and used to represent the features .",
    "finally , the high order spline3 function was used to fit the median line , and features were removed from each line of the image .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows an example of such spurious features in a @xmath18-band image .",
    "the upper two panels show plots of the average of 500 lines in two different parts of the ccd frame .",
    "the left panel shows lines 1 to 500 , while the right panel shows lines 971 to 1470 .",
    "as one can see , the features in both panels are quite similar , indicating that these features are quite systematic through the whole ccd frame .",
    "the lower two panels show the same plots as in the upper panels , except that the spurious features are now subtracted .",
    "one can see that the patterns are removed quite successfully by our method . in most cases , the subtraction method reduced the spatial variation to a level @xmath45 adu .",
    "the subtraction method failed to suppress the variation to such a low level only for a few very large galaxies and for images with heavily saturated stars , where it is difficult to find a sufficiently large blank - line region to estimate the median value .",
    "the fwhms of the sdss psfs ( @xmath46 ) are much smaller than those of the 2mass ( @xmath47 )",
    ". therefore the sdss images were downgraded by convolving with a proper gaussian kernel to match the 2mass psfs , in order that seds for the inner regions of the galaxies could be obtained with a similar seeing in different bands .",
    "note that the sdss psf may change slightly from band to band , and the kernel used is in accordance with the specific filter and field in consideration .",
    "to obtain the true surface brightness profiles , an accurate sky background subtraction is essential .",
    "for a given galaxy , all other objects in the frame were masked using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "since most of the sample galaxies have sizes of only a few arcmins , a region of sky sufficient to fit the sky background reasonably well could easily be found .    the isophote package in iraf",
    "was used to fit each of the sky - subtracted images with a series of elliptical annuli from the center to the outskirts , with the length of the semi - major axis increasing by 10% in each step .",
    "the width of annuli was chosen to increase with radius to suppress noise in the outer regions , where the signal - to - noise is low .",
    "the coordinates of the photometric peak in each band were obtained by the daophot package and were fixed in the fit .",
    "the difference in the peak coordinates between the eight bands is less than @xmath48 .",
    "we also fixed the sky level in the fit , but kept other parameters , such as ellipticity and position angle , as free parameters .",
    "in addition , all foreground and background objects were masked out in order to reduce their contamination .",
    "since our goal was to obtain the radial profile of the sed , it was essential that each elliptical isophotic annulus have the same physical size in all of the eight bands . to achieve this the @xmath14-band image was used to define isophotic annuli , and",
    "these were applied to all the eight bands .    in the sdss ,",
    "photometric quantities are usually quoted in the ` petrosian ' system(petrosian 1976 ) .",
    "sdss defines the petrosian ratio @xmath49 at a radius @xmath14 from the center of an object to be the ratio of the local surface brightness averaged over an annulus at @xmath14 to the mean surface brightness within @xmath14 ( blanton et al .",
    "2001 ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) : @xmath50 }   { \\int_0^r dr ' 2\\pi r ' i(r ' ) / [ \\pi r^2]},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile .",
    "the petrosian radius @xmath52 is defined as the radius at which @xmath53 equals 0.2 . the petrosian flux in any band is then defined to be the flux within two petrosian radii : @xmath54 the petrosian half light radius @xmath55 is defined as the radius within which 50% of the petrosian flux is contained .    in our analysis",
    ", we cut off the brightness profiles at a radius of @xmath56 . at this radius ,",
    "the surface brightness is about 8% of the @xmath17 , @xmath14 , @xmath19-skys , and is about 2% of the @xmath18 , @xmath20-skys , and about 0.1 - 0.3% of the @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath32-skys .",
    "the typical values of @xmath55 of our sample galaxies are about @xmath57 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows an example of the surface brightness profiles obtained , in this case for ngc  0430 , and figure  [ fig3 ] shows the corresponding seds derived from the fluxes in the eight bands at different radii . to have an overall view of the color gradient for the sample galaxies we are considering , we show in figure  [ fig4 ] the relative shape of the sed at different radii ( in units of @xmath55 ) in terms of the median values for the for 35 sample galaxies .",
    "the offset of the seds at @xmath58 and at @xmath59 is about 0.4 mag from the red end to the blue end .",
    "this implies a color gradient in the sample galaxies , in the sense that the stellar light becomes redder toward the central regions .",
    "such gradients will be quantified further in section  [ sec gradient of a - m ] .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath60 for the @xmath61band shows abnormal behavior at all radii . in the inner region",
    ", the @xmath19-band surface brightness appears fainter than expected , while in the outer region it is brighter .",
    "as we will see in section  [ subsubsec psf ] and in the appendix , this is caused by the so called ` red - halo ' effect in the @xmath61band .",
    "the sdss magnitudes are quite close to the ab - magnitude system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "the zero - point of magnitude for each frame can be obtained directly from the edr catalogue , and the corrections to the ab system are -0.042 , 0.036 , 0.015 , 0.013 , and -0.002 for the @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath14 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 bands respectively ( blanton et al .",
    "the 2mass zero - point in the vega magnitude system can be found in the atlas image header .",

    "all magnitudes are in the ab system unless otherwise stated .",

    ".    one crucial step in our analysis is to take into account the photometric error in the different wavebands .",
    "the observational error in the surface brightness profile consists of the following several components .",
    "the first is random error , including the readout noise , the shot noise of the sky background and the shot noise of the galaxy in consideration . at small radii , where the brightness of the galaxy is much higher than the sky background , the noise from the galaxy dominates . on the other hand , at large radii where the brightness of the galaxy is much fainter than the sky background",
    ", the noise from the galaxy can be neglected in comparison to the readout noise and the noise of sky background .",
    "here we are concerned mainly with the errors in the outer region , because these errors determine to which radius the observed surface brightness profile can be trusted . in the first row of table  [ tab error ]",
    ", we list the random error in one pixel ( expressed in terms of the percentage of sky level ) , which includes both the readout noise and the noise due to the sky background . because the radial profile is the average of the flux of all the pixels in the corresponding isophote annulus , the final error introduced by random noise depends on the number of pixels in the annulus . for most of our galaxies ,",
    "the annulus at @xmath56 contains more than 2,500 pixels in a sdss image , and more than 400 pixels in a 2mass image .",
    "the final random errors at @xmath56 are also presented in table  [ tab error ] .",
    "it should be noted that the 2mass images were produced by averaging 6 frames ; the camera pixels were divided into 4 final coadd pixels and the pixel values were smoothed by the weinberg filter ( jarrett et al .",
    "all these have been taken into consideration in our error estimates .",
    "another important source of error in the outer part of a galaxy is from background subtraction .",
    "this error was estimated in a way similar to that described in wu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) where the deep optical images of the edge - on galaxy ngc  4565 was analyzed .",
    "firstly , all the objects including the target source were masked in the background - subtracted image .",
    "secondly , a series of boxes with a size of @xmath62 were used to cover the entire image , where the box size is chosen to be comparable to the typical value of @xmath56 of the sample galaxies , so that they can be used to estimate the large - scale error induced by improper background subtraction and flat - field correction .",
    "finally , the average of the un - masked region in each box is obtained , and the standard deviation of these averages among all the boxes was used as the error of background subtraction .",
    "this error is larger than the random noise in the optical bands but lower than the random noise in the near - infrared bands .",
    "note that the background subtraction will not work well if severe airglow variation exists in the near - infrared images ( jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "absolute calibration errors are also very important in our analysis , because we want to construct the seds using the fluxes in different bands . fortunately , such errors are quite small , about 0.02 mag in all the sdss and 2mass bands ( abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ; cohen , wheaton & megeath 2003 ) .    in conclusion , the total error budget combining all of the errors discussed above is smaller than 0.03 mag in the @xmath17- , @xmath14- , @xmath19-bands , 0.07 mag in the @xmath20-band , 0.18 mag in @xmath18 and about 0.3 mag in @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 . it should be pointed out here that only the outmost few points in our color profiles have large errors ; the total profile of a galaxy is not affected significantly by these uncertainties .",
    "in addition to the normal photometric corrections discussed above , there was another instrumental effect that affected the surface photometry analysis .",
    "since the sdss photometry survey uses a thinned ccd for the @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath19 bands , there is an effect referred in the literature as the ` red halo ' of the psf wings ( e.g. michard 2002 ) .",
    "this effect causes the extended wing of the red - band psf to be much brighter than that in the blue - band . in the sdss photometric system ,",
    "the red halo in the @xmath19-band is more apparent than that in the other bands ( see appendix ) .",
    "since most of the sample galaxies have sizes of about several arcmins and the red halo effect appears prominent at about 10 to 50 arcsecs , it is a serious problem in measurements of surface photometry , and will also affect the measured sed and color gradients . as pointed out by michard ( 2002 ) , the red halo effect depends on both observational time and the field . to avoid such an effect",
    ", we will discard the @xmath19-band data in the following discussion .",

    "2004 ) 3 of these 6 early - type galaxies exhibit dust features and the dust distribution have a size of about 1 to 3 kpc .",
    "however , dust distribution in early type galaxies is still poorly understood ; only simple models are available to investigate possible effect of the dust extinction on color gradients . here",
    "we follow wise & silva ( 1996 ) and consider three simple models for the dust distribution .",
    "the most likely case is that of a concentrated dust distribution , which is suggested by current observations .",
    "if dust distribution has a spatial density distribution of @xmath147 or is even more concentrated , then dust absorption is only significant in the very central region of the galaxy ( @xmath148 ; see fig . 8 in wise & silva 1996 ) . in this case",
    ", dust extinction will not have any effect on our results , since we have excluded the central region of a galaxy ( within @xmath63 , @xmath149 1.4 kpc on average ) in our analysis .",
    "the second case is a flat density distribution of dust @xmath150 . in this case ,",
    "dust absorption is almost the same over the whole body of a galaxy , and it will not produce any radial gradients in colors ( or in the seds ) .",
    "a third case is a distribution between these two extreme cases . according to wise & silva s analysis ,",
    "if the dust is distributed as @xmath151 , it will cause a linear color gradient with @xmath152 , which can be confused with true metallicity and/or age gradients . to be conservative , we consider here the effect of dust extinction assuming such a distribution .",
    "following charlot & fall ( 2000 ) , we assume a power - law form for the dust absorption curve : @xmath153 . the absorption by dust can then be parameterized with a single parameter @xmath154 , which is the effective optical depth at a wavelength of @xmath155 .",
    "another assumption is that @xmath156 decreases linearly with @xmath152 , and approaches _ zero _ in the outer region ( in practice , we set @xmath157 ) .",
    "this absorption model can also be derived from wise & silva s ( 1996 ) calculations ( see the dotted line in their fig.8 ) .",
    "thus only one additional free parameter , @xmath158 , is needed to describe the absorption of such a diffuse distribution of dust as a function of radius @xmath159 .",
    "ccccc @xmath158 & @xmath125 & @xmath137 & @xmath124 & @xmath138 + 0.0 & -0.25@xmath850.03 & 0.19@xmath850.03 & 0.02@xmath850.04 & 0.25@xmath850.03 + 0.1 & -0.19@xmath850.04 & 0.22@xmath850.03 & 0.02@xmath850.04 & 0.23@xmath850.03 + 0.2 & -0.13@xmath850.04 & 0.22@xmath850.03 & 0.00@xmath850.04 & 0.23@xmath850.03 + 0.4 & -0.02@xmath850.04 & 0.21@xmath850.03 & 0.00@xmath850.03 & 0.18@xmath850.03 +    the ssp fitting procedure was then carried out by convolving the absorption curves at different radii with the given values of @xmath158 , and the effects on age and metallicity gradients recorded .",
    "we have done several tests with different values of @xmath158 , and the results are summarized in table  [ tab dust ] . compared with the dust - free case @xmath160 ,",
    "it is clear that the existence of a diffuse dust distribution can indeed cause a radial color gradient and thereby reduce the degree of metallicity gradients .",
    "however , it does not change the average value of the age gradients . if the total amount of diffusing dust is large enough so that @xmath161 , the different levels of absorption at different radii can explain all the observed color gradients in our sample . > from wise & silva s calculation , about @xmath162 of diffuse dust is needed to produce the required @xmath161 .",
    "the dust model we have used is likely too simple to describe the dust distribution in galaxies realistically .",
    "more precise description of the dust distribution in early - type galaxies may be possible with the future observations , such that from the spitzer space telescope . in summary",
    ", the presence of diffuse dust distribution can mimic the color gradients we have observed , and the metallicity gradients we obtained ( @xmath163 ) is only robust if the amount of dust in the diffuse distribution is negligible .",
    "simulations of the formation of elliptical galaxies through monolithic collapse ( e.g. carlberg 1984 ) have shown that the metallicity gradients predicted by this model are quite steep , with @xmath125 at least as steep as -0.5 .",
    "this is clearly in conflict with our average result of @xmath163 .",
    "on the other hand , recent simulations of kobayashi ( 2004 ) showed that metallicity gradients can be significantly flattened by strong mergers .",
    "they showed that galaxies formed through major mergers have @xmath164 and none of them have a gradient steeper then @xmath165 , while galaxies formed through minor mergers or monolithic collapse are quite similar , with metallicity gradients of approximately @xmath7 .",
    "our average metallicity gradient is between @xmath166 and @xmath167 , but individual gradients span a wide range from -0.6 to above zero . since kobayashi used a similar radius range as ours to measure gradients , we can compare our observational results directly with her simulations . to proceed ,",
    "we adopt a metallicity gradient of @xmath168 to separate galaxies into two subsamples . according to kobayashi s results , the subsample with metallicity gradients shallower than @xmath168",
    "would be galaxies dominated by a major merger , while those with steeper metallicity gradients are the ones whose formation would be dominated by minor mergers or monolithic collapse . in figure  [ fig13 ]",
    "we plot the absolute magnitude ( @xmath169 ) distribution for these two subsamples of galaxies .",
    "although the average @xmath169 is similar for the two subsamples ( about @xmath170 ) , the two distributions are different .",
    "most of the galaxies in the subsample with @xmath171 ( i.e. the one with steeper gradient ) are fainter .",
    "since nearly half of our galaxies are s0 galaxies which have luminosities lower than elliptical galaxies , it is possible that the subsample with lower gradients is in fact dominated by s0 galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the sample is too small to allow us to probe the detailed dependence on morphological type .",
    "the subsample with lower gradients also includes the three brightest galaxies in the whole sample ( ugc05515 , ugc00797 and ngc  5865 ) .",
    "it is interesting that ugc00797 is a cd galaxy and the other two also look like cd galaxies from their environment and radial profiles .",
    "if merger plays an important role in determining the metallicity gradient , as discussed above , this result would mean that cd - like galaxies and faint ellipticals form through many minor mergers and/or monolithic collapse .",
    "our current sample is still too small to make a strong statement , but this question can be addressed with large samples to be constructed from the sdss and the 2mass .",
    "another interesting result is that we obtain a quite large scatter in @xmath125 , @xmath45 .",
    "this can not be explained by the uncertainties in measurement or fitting alone , which are approximately an order of magnitude lower .",
    "thus , such scatter must be intrinsic . in this study",
    "we have not separated galaxies according to morphology ( e.g. lenticulars versus ellipticals , normal ellipticals versus cds ) and environment , and the large scatter may be partly due to morphology and environment dependence .",
    "our result is also consistent with the simulation of kobayashi ( 2004 ) , who obtained similar scatter among all the galaxies in her simulation .",
    "the average value of the age gradient we found , @xmath172 , suggests that stars over a wide range of radius in early - type galaxies ( 0.4 to 5.0 @xmath55 as probed in this paper ) , have approximately the same age .",
    "this is consistent with the monolithic collapse formation scenario , where the bulk of stars in a galaxy formed in a single burst , or with similar star formation history over the whole galaxy .",
    "however , the lack of a significant age gradient does not contradict with the hierarchical formation scenario , if early - type galaxies formed their stars early in their progenitors .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the optical and near - infrared surface photometry of a sample of 36 nearby early - type galaxies based on broad - band images obtained from sdss and 2mass .",
    "the optical and near - infrared color gradients of each galaxy have been derived and modelled in terms of metallicity and age gradients in their underlying stellar populations .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "almost all galaxies show shallow color gradients in the five sdss bands and the three 2mass bands .",
    "the measured average color gradients in @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath173 are @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath102 respectively , in agreement with previous results .",
    "2 .   for the first time , seds from optical to near - infrared wavelengths have been used to analyze the stellar population distribution of early - type galaxies .",
    "both tests and results have proved the strength of combining sdss and 2mass data in the study of stellar populations .",
    "fitting both the age and metallicity simultaneously with stellar population synthesis models , and using @xmath176 and @xmath177 to represent the metallicity and age gradients , a median value of @xmath2 was found for the metallicity gradient , with a dispersion of @xmath3 .",
    "corresponding values for the age gradient are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with other observational results and with the expectations of current theories of galaxy formation .",
    "4 .   a diffuse distribution of dust [ @xmath151 ] could produce a linear color gradient with @xmath152 , but it will not change the result that the average age gradient is @xmath179 . if any diffusely distributed dust exists , it would decrease metallicity gradients , which would further support the hypothesis that major mergers play an important role in the formation of the early - type galaxies .",
    "given the amount of new data now available from the 2mass and the current sdss ( dr2 ) , and data soon to be available from the sdss and the spitzer space telescope in the near future , it will be possible to compile a sample of several hundred large early - type galaxies to carry out the same analysis as presented in this paper .",
    "our results presented here suggest that with such a sample , it will be possible to study the age - metallicity gradients of early - type galaxies in unprecedented detail .",

    "michard ( 2002 ) studied the psfs of thinned ccds in different bands , concluding that atmospheric seeing dominates the central range of the psf , and that the effects of seeing disappear at around @xmath180 .",
    "however , in the outer regions , the wing of the psf is controlled by both instrumental and atmospheric scattering .",
    "the extended wing of the red - band psf is much brighter than that of the blue band in thinned ccds .",
    "this is referred to as the ` red halo ' effect ( michard 2002 ; idiart , michard , & de freitas pacheco 2002 ) .",
    "the sdss project employs 30 tektronix / site 2048@xmath212048 ccds in a 5 by 6 array for the five bands , with 6 unthinned frontside ccds for the @xmath20-band , and 24 thinned backside ccds for the other four bands . to explore the outer psf wings in these five bands , isolated unsaturated and saturated stars in different edr fields",
    "were selected .",
    "all of these fields were sky subtracted and the median intensity was measured in concentric circles around each star to avoid the effect of asymmetric features of saturated stars , and of foreground and background objects .",
    "the profiles of all stars for each band were re - scaled to the same size and combined .",
    "the mean psf profiles in the five bands were then obtained .",
    "figure  [ fig14 ] shows the radial profiles of the mean psfs in the five bands .",
    "the red halo problem is clearly apparent .",
    "the @xmath19-band profile is quite different from the other four bands at radii starting from about @xmath181 , consistent with the results of michard ( 2002 ) .",
    "thus the red halo effect is expected to affect the surface brightness profiles of galaxies at radii larger than @xmath182 .",
    "the psf profiles in the @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath20 bands agree very well with each other .",
    "although the @xmath20-band is much redder than the @xmath19-band , there is no red halo problem because unthinned ccds are used .",
    "this confirms that the red halo effect only appears in thinned ccds .",
    "the @xmath18-band psf is slightly higher than those of the @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath20 bands , but much lower than that of the @xmath19-band . in this paper",
    "we neglect this small difference between the @xmath18-band and the @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath20 bands .",
