    ", the merging of low - mass galaxies to form more massive ones naively seems to imply a continuous evolution of their mass structure ( e.g.  bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) , both in their outer regions and dense inner regions ( e.g.  smaller galaxies accrete and sink to the center through dynamical friction ) . on the one hand",
    ", the inner regions of massive ellipticals can contract into an increasingly denser structure , if significant mass in dissipational gas is accreted ( e.g.  blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ; ryden & gunn 1987 ; navarro & benz 1991 ; dubinski 1994 ; jesseit , naab & burkert 2002 ; gnedin et al.2004 ; kazantzidis et al .",
    "if this process occurs at @xmath0@xmath261 ( e.g.  kauffmann , charlot & white 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) and results in star - formation activity , one can test this scenario directly by using high - quality data of early - type galaxies , obtained with space and 810 m class ground - based telescopes ( e.g.  menanteau et al .  2001a&b ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ; mcintosh et al .  2005 ; tran et al .",
    "on the other hand , the mass inside the inner @xmath1810kpc of the most massive ellipticals ( i.e.@xmath27l@xmath28 ) seems to remain nearly constant from @xmath29 to the present day  as suggested by collisionless dark - matter simulations  and additionally accreted dark matter replaces already - present collisionless matter ( e.g.  wechsler et al .  2002 ; zhao et al.2003 ; gao et al .",
    "2004 ) . if most gas is turned into ( collisionless ) stellar mass before mergers ( e.g. van dokkum et al .",
    "1999 ) , one expects it to behave similarly to dark matter during assembly in to the more massive galaxies seen at @xmath30 .",
    "based on the notion that the velocity function of massive early - type galaxies at @xmath0=0 ( sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) is remarkably close to that of the inner regions ( inside @xmath1810  kpc ) of the most massive simulated galaxies at @xmath0@xmath316  even though these galaxies continue to accrete collisionless matter below that redshift ",
    "loeb & peebles  ( 2003 ) suggest that the inner regions might behave as _ dynamical attractors _ , whose phase - space density is nearly invariant under the accretion of collisionless matter ( see also e.g.  gao et al .  2004 ; kazantzidis , zentner & kravtsov 2005 ) . in this scenario",
    ", one might expect less structural evolution of the inner regions of massive early - type galaxies at @xmath32 , compared to models where most gas had not yet turned into stars _ before _ the mass assembly of their inner regions took place .",
    "hence , one way to study the formation scenario of massive ellipticals , is to quantify the evolution of the mass distribution in their inner regions from redshifts @xmath0=1 to  0 .    from the observational point of view",
    ", a significant effort has been devoted in the past two decades to the study of the mass structure of early - type galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath0@xmath260.1 ) through stellar dynamical tracers and x - ray studies ( e.g.  fabbiano 1989 ; mould et al .",

    "( 2001 ) conclude that massive ellipticals have , on average , flat circular velocity curves with a scatter of @xmath1810% in their inner two effective radii .",
    "this in itself should impose stringent constraints on any numerical simulations of elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  meza et al .",
    "2003 ; kawata & gibson 2003 ) .",
    "strong gravitational lensing provides a complementary approach ( kochanek 1991 ) to study early - type galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "lensing analysis has been used to demonstrate the presence of dark matter around early - type galaxies and , in some systems , to provide evidence for `` isothermal '' ( i.e. @xmath33 ) mass density profiles equivalent to the flat rotation curves observed for spiral galaxies ( e.g. , kochanek 1995 ; rusin & ma 2001 ; ma 2003 ; rusin et al .",

    "however , the mass - profile ( e.g.  wucknitz 2002 ) and mass - sheet degeneracies ( falco et al .  1985 ) often prevent a truly accurate determination of the logarithmic density slope _ at _ the einstein radius .    to answer the question `` _ what is the mass structure inside the inner regions of early - type galaxies and",
    "how does it evolve with time ? _ '' , we therefore combine constraints from strong gravitational lensing and stellar kinematics .",
    "the former provides an accurate mass measurement inside the einstein radius ( kochanek 1991 ) , whereas the latter provides a measurement of the mass gradient .",
    "the average logarithmic density slope inside the einstein radius can then be determined  independent of the mass - sheet degeneracy that is associated with the galaxy mass distribution  with the same fractional accuracy as is obtained on the luminosity - weighted stellar velocity dispersion ( e.g.  see treu & koopmans 2002 and koopmans 2004 ) .",
    "the density slopes of _ individual _ early - type galaxy can be correlated with redshift , to determine any structural evolution in the population .    in an ongoing study of massive early - type lens galaxies between @xmath34 and 1 , as part of the _ lenses structure & dynamics _ ( lsd ) survey ( koopmans & treu 2002 , 2003 ; treu & koopmans 2002 , 2003 , 2004 ; hereafter tk04 )  plus two additional systems that were studied to measure the hubble constant ( treu & koopmans 2002 ; koopmans et al 2003 )  this technique has successfully been applied , to place the first constraints on the inner density slopes and dark - matter halos of early - type galaxies to @xmath35 ( tk04 ) , finding a logarithmic density slope close to isothermal , although the results were limited by the small sample size .    in the first paper of this series ( bolton et al .",
    "2006 ; hereafter paper i ) , we reported on the discovery of nineteen new early - type lens galaxies from the _ sloan lens acs _ ( slacs ) survey at @xmath36 , each with _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) f435w and f814w images and a stellar velocity dispersion measured from their sdss spectra ( e.g.  bolton et al .",
    "some systems have integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) of their lensed sources , obtained with magellan and/or gemini ( see also bolton et al .  2005 ) .",
    "as far as their photometric properties are concerned , they are representative of luminous red galaxies ( lrg ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2004 ) with similar redshifts and similar stellar velocity dispersions ( see paper i ) .",
    "they also lie on the fundamental plane ( fp ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) of early - type galaxies , have old stellar populations , and have very homogeneous mass density profiles ( treu et al .",
    "2006 ; hereafter paper ii ) .    in this paper , we focus on the analysis of a sub - sample of fifteen isolated early - type lens galaxies from slacs , combining the constraints from _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) images with the stellar velocity dispersion obtained from the sdss database .",
    "the goals are to quantify their inner mass structure and to assess whether any evolution of their inner regions has occurred at  @xmath37 . in  2 , we present non - parametric lens models for each system .",
    "the simplicity of the models supports their lensed nature and provides the necessary input for subsequent analysis . in  3 , we use the enclosed mass from lensing in a joint stellar - dynamical analysis , to determine the inner density slopes of each early - type galaxy . in combination with results from the lsd survey , we analyze the redshift behavior of the density slope in  4 to quantify its evolution . in  5 , we summarize our results and draw conclusions . throughout this paper , we assume h@xmath38=70kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the selection procedure of lens candidates for the hst snaphot program ( see bolton et al .",
    "2004 and paper i ) and the sub - sample of the fifteen early - type lens galaxies that we use throughout this paper , in addition to their lens models .",
    "the models are used to quantify the alignment between stellar and total mass (  2.4 ) and provide the mass enclosed by the lensed images as an external constraint on the stellar - dynamical models (  3 ) .      the selection procedure that led to the current sample of confirmed e / s0 lens galaxies , used in this paper , is as follows : first , a principle - component analysis ( pca ) is done of all spectra in the lrg and main galaxy samples from the sdss .",
    "the smooth pca spectra are subtracted from the observed spectra and the residuals are studied for absorption and higher - redshift emission lines .",
    "the absorption lines secure the redshift of the foreground galaxy and allow the luminosity - weighted stellar velocity dispersions to be measured for the brighter galaxies .",
    "second , the residual spectra that show three or more atomic transition lines in emission , including [ oii ] , at a single redshift beyond that of the main galaxy are selected for follow - up .",
    "third , given the redshifts and stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath41 ) of the foreground galaxies , and the redshifts of the lensed source candidates , we can estimate their lensing probability by ranking the systems according to their einstein radii @xmath42 , assuming a sis mass model with @xmath43 ( e.g.  schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) from large to small ( the sdss fiber radius ) have a probability of unity to be multiply imaged lens systems , because one of the two lensed images forms between 01@xmath44 and the second image forms between 12@xmath44 . hence , observing an image inside 2@xmath44 implies that a counter image must exist . ] .",
    "this procedure resulted in a ranked list of 49 candidates , of which 20 are from the lrg sample in bolton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and the remaining 29 are from the main galaxy sample .",
    "we further note that galaxies in the lrg sample were selected based on early - type spectra , photometry and morphology ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) , whereas the main sample is more hetrogeneous with the general requirement , set by us , that ew@xmath45  ( but see paper i ) . even though the selection is not completely uniform , the resulting sample of e / s0 lens systems is indistinguishable in its photometric and scaling - relation properties from non - lens samples ( see paper ii )",
    "nonetheless , we remain cautious of potential selection effects .    of the 28 systems observed as of 2005 march 31  the cutoff date for this first series of papers  we confirmed 19 as unambiguous lens systems . of the remaining 9 systems , six show some hint of a counter - image near the galaxy center , but in all these cases these are too faint to be confirmed as true lens systems with the present data ( paper i ) , while three lack any visible lensed images or are magnfied , but singly imaged , galaxies inside the sdss fiber aperture .    the galaxy - subtracted hst ",
    "acs f435w and f814w images of each of the observed slacs lens candidates are presented in paper i. in general , the f814w images have better signal - to - noise compared to the f435w images and thus serve as the primary constraint on the lens models .",
    "the f435w images are only used to further validate the lensed nature of the multiple images ( e.g.  based on similar colors and structure ) .    in this paper , four additional lens systems are removed to construct a clean sample of `` isolated '' early - type galaxies4 einstein radii from each other ( kochanek & apostolakis  1988 ) . hence , `` isolated '' implies non - interacting and lensing that is dominated by a single massive galaxy inside the sdss fibre and several einstein radii .",
    "this constraint is rather weak , affecting only @xmath1810% of the systems . ] : one system is a bulge - dominated spiral galaxy ( sdssj1251@xmath46021 ) , two systems have _ two _ dominant lens galaxies inside the lensed images ( sdssj1618 + 439 and sdssj1718 + 644 ) and one system has a nearby perturbing companion that also contributes significantly to the light inside the sdss spectral fiber ( sdssj1205 + 492 ) .",
    "the latter makes its stellar dispersion measurement unreliable .",
    "all fifteen remaining systems ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) are genuine massive early - type lens galaxies , with a redshift range of @xmath47 and an average stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath48kms@xmath2 ( rms of 44kms@xmath2 ) inside the sdss spectroscopic aperture .",
    "all conclusions in this paper are based on this sample of 15 galaxies , except for those presented in  4 and  5 .",
    "the purposes of the lens models are three - fold : ( i ) confirm that the systems are genuine gravitational lenses and that they can be explained through a simple strong lens model , ( ii ) accurately determine the mass enclosed by the lensed images , and ( iii ) quantify the alignment between the stellar and total mass distribution .    to determine the mass enclosed by the lensed images , we follow the procedure described previously in e.g.  koopmans & treu ( 2003 ) and treu & koopmans ( 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "first , we determine the `` best - fit '' elliptical lens mass model and for that , derive the mass ( m@xmath49 ) enclosed by the outer ( tangential ) critical curve .",
    "second , we determine the associated circularly - symmetric mass model  having the same radial density profile  that encloses the same mass inside its critical curve at radius r@xmath50 , which we call the einstein radius .",
    "we use the parametric _ singular isothermal ellipsoid _ mass model ( sie ; kormann et al .",
    "1994 ) to describe the projected mass distribution ( i.e.  convergence ) of the lens galaxies ( appropriately translated and rotated ) : @xmath51 with @xmath52 being the axial ratio of constant elliptical surface density contours .",
    "note that the mass enclosed by the elliptical critical curves , using the above normalization , is independent of @xmath53 ( kormann et al .",
    "the definition of the enclosed mass ( m@xmath50 ) and the einstein radius ( r@xmath49 ) then correspond to those for a classical singular isothermal sphere ( sis with @xmath54=1 ; e.g.  binney & tremaine 1987 ) and can be associated with a velocity dispersion through @xmath55 ( see schneider et al .",
    "this velocity dispersion should _ not _ be confused with that of the stellar component embedded in an overall isothermal ( i.e.  @xmath56 ) mass distribution ( e.g.kochanek 1994 ) .",
    "the two quantities can differ , depending on the precise distribution of the stars , their orbital structure inside the overall potential , and the aperture within which the dispersion is measured ( koopmans 2004 ) .",
    "the complexity of many of the extended lensed images ( paper i ) prohibits a simple parameterized description of the source ( e.g.point images ) . their brightness distributions are therefore reconstructed on a grid of typically @xmath57 square pixels , with a pixel - size that depends on scale of the lensed images and their magnification ( typically between @xmath58 ) .",
    "we use the regularized non - parametric source reconstruction code described in tk04 and koopmans ( 2005 )  based on the non - parametric source reconstruction method by warren & dye ( 2003 )  with the parametric sie mass model for the lens potential .",
    "we emphasize that the choice of isothermal lens models influences the mass determination within the critical line at a level of a few percent at the most ( e.g. kochanek 1991 ) .",
    "this systematic uncertainty is at present negligible in our analyses of the logarithmic density slope ( see   3.4 for a proper discussion ) , and to first order our lensing and stellar - dynamical analyses can be regarded as independent .",
    "we center the mass model on the brightness peak of the lens galaxy and vary the three remaining model parameters ( i.e.  lens strength @xmath59 , ellipticity @xmath53 and position angle @xmath60 ) . at each optimization step",
    ", we determine the source structure that minimizes the value of the penalty function @xmath61 , which includes a @xmath62 and a regularization term .",
    "the mass - model parameters and @xmath63 are varied until @xmath64 minimizes to @xmath65 ( see warren & dye 2003 or koopmans 2005 for details ) .    because the main objective in this paper is to obtain the mass of the galaxy enclosed by its einstein radius  for subsequent dynamical analyzes (  3 )  neither the precise choice of the source pixel scale nor the regularization level ( i.e.  the value of @xmath63 ) is found to have a significant impact on the resulting values of r@xmath66 and m@xmath50 .",
    "we therefore postpone a precise analysis of the structure of the sources to a future publication .",
    "the sie models are sufficiently accurate to ( i ) confirm the lensed nature of each system , ( ii ) measure the mass enclosed by the lensed images to a few percent accuracy ( see above discussion ) , and ( iii ) determine the orientation of the mass distribution with respect to its stellar distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : siemodels ] shows the observed structure of the lensed images in the f814w band ",
    "after lens galaxy subtraction ( paper i )  and the currently best lensed - image reconstruction for each of the fifteen selected lens systems .",
    "none of the models require significant external shear above a few percent to improve the models .",
    "therefore we can assume it to be zero for simplicity ( see  2.4.1 for more discussion ) .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] summarizes the best - fit parameters from the sie mass modeling .",
    "we find the ratios @xmath67 ( rms of 0.19 ) between the einstein radius and the sdss fiber radius of 15 , and @xmath68 ( rms of 0.17 ) between the einstein radius and the effective radius ( see paper ii ) , with @xmath69kpc ( rms of 1.6kpc ) .",
    "hence , when discussing the `` inner regions '' of early - type galaxies , we assume this to be approximately the inner 4  kpc .      using the sie mass models",
    ", we can assess how well light ( i.e. stellar mass ) traces the total mass density .",
    "in hindsight , this correlation is not surprising , because most of the mass inside r@xmath50 is in fact stellar ( see  3.5 ) .",
    "however , a significant misalignment or difference in ellipticity between the stellar and dark - matter mass components  even _ outside _ the einstein radius  would affect the lens models and show up as differences or increased scatter in the position - angle difference and ellipticity ratio between stellar and total mass .",
    "note also that we implicitly assume an isothermal density profile  which will be further supported in  3.2  which in principle could affect the determination of the mass ellipticity and position angle .",
    "one test of the lens mass models is the position - angle alignment @xmath70 between the stellar component and the sie lens model .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : align ] .",
    "the average difference is @xmath71  degrees , with an rms spread of 10  degrees .",
    "no significant correlation is found between @xmath72 and other lens properties .",
    "one notices an increase in the rms of @xmath73 with increasing @xmath53 , because it becomes increasingly more difficult to determine both @xmath74 and @xmath60 for @xmath75 : the rms for @xmath76 is 3 degrees , whereas it increases to 13 degrees for @xmath77 .",
    "however , no significant deviations of @xmath78 from zero are found in either bin .    assuming that ( keeton , kochanek & seljak  1997 ) @xmath79 ) } {    ( \\epsilon/3\\gamma_{\\rm ext})\\cos(2 [ \\theta_{\\rm    sie}-\\theta_{\\gamma}])}\\right)^2 \\right\\rangle^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the external shear , @xmath81 the shear angle , and @xmath82 ( see  [ sect : ellipticity ] ) and that no correlation between galaxy and external shear orientations exists",
    ", we then find that the rms of 10 degrees in @xmath83 implies that that the average shear has an upper limit @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the alignment between the mass and light position angle confirms that external shear is very small and can be neglected , and that the galaxies are effectively isolated in terms of their gravitational lens properties in the inner @xmath184kpc .",
    "( note that this does not imply that galaxies _ are _ isolated , only that the effect of the field on their lensing properties is small . )",
    "a second test is to see how well the elliptical isophotal and isodensity contours trace each other .",
    "fig.[fig : align ] also shows the ratio between the ellipticity of the stellar light ( paper ii ; @xmath85 ) and that of the lens mass model ( @xmath53 ) , as a function of velocity dispersion ( i.e.  approximately mass ) . above @xmath86 of @xmath18225 kms@xmath2 , the ratio @xmath87 with an rms of 0.11 ,",
    "hence light traces mass also in ellipticity .",
    "below @xmath18225 kms@xmath2 , the correlation shows a sudden upturn to @xmath881.6 , which we attribute to the fact that those three galaxies ( i.e.  j0959 + 042 , j1330 - 018 and j1420 + 603 ) show inclined disky structure and can be classified as lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies ( see paper i ) .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the sie mass model ( further supported in  3 ) quantifies the mass ellipticity to @xmath1810% accuracy .",
    "we can therefore take the average of @xmath53 as a good measure of the projected isodensity ellipticity of early - type galaxies : @xmath12=0.78 with an rms of 0.12 .",
    "we note that this ellipticity is that of the stellar plus dark - matter mass distribution , not that of the dark - matter halo only . using @xmath89^{1/2 } \\rangle,\\ ] ] assuming that mass is stratified on oblate constant density ellipsoids and lens - galaxies are randomly oriented ( i.e.  @xmath90 ) , this implies an axis ratio in density of @xmath91 with an error of about 0.2 .    as an additional check",
    ", we assess whether the ellipticity distributions of the slacs e / s0 lens - galaxy sample and early - type galaxies could possibly be different , which would suggest a possible selection bias .",
    "for the 15 slacs e / s0 lens galaxies , we find @xmath92 with an rms of 0.13 , in excellent agreement with nearby e / s0 galaxies ( e.g.  lambas et al .  1992 ; odewahn et al .  1997 ) which peak between 0.70.8 .",
    "we conclude also that the ellipticities of slacs lens galaxies are similar to those of nearby early - type galaxies .",
    "we conclude : ( i ) the small position - angle difference between the stellar and total mass implies that dark matter is aligned with the stellar component on scales @xmath93  kpc and probably also beyond .",
    "even though stellar mass dominates in this region ( see  3.5 ) , a misalignment of stellar and dark matter , even beyond the einstein radius , can cause an apparent `` external '' shear ( keeton , kochanek & seljak 1997 ) , which is not observed in our sample .",
    "( ii ) significant external shear due to nearby galaxies or a misalignment of the outer dark - matter halo with the inner stellar - dominated region is not required in any of the lens model .",
    "significant external shear would in general cause a spread in @xmath83 if not accounted for in the models .",
    "( iii ) the isophotal and isodensity contours of massive elliptical galaxies ( @xmath94225 kms@xmath2 ) seem to follow each other well in their inner regions , whereas the lower velocity dispersion lenticular galaxies have a much rounder mass than light distribution .      in papers",
    "i & ii , we discussed a bias in favor of more concentrated light - distributions for lens galaxies compared to their parent population with equivalent @xmath41 . because the s / n limit imposed on the velocity - dispersion measurements of lens - galaxy candidates was also imposed on the parent sample , and their distribution in s / n can not be distinguished according to a k - s test , we concluded in paper ii that a bias in s / n due to the finite fiber size is not the underlying cause .    here",
    "we propose another bias that might cause part of this effect .",
    "the bias arises because the parent population is chosen to have the same value of @xmath41 as that of the lens galaxy , but not necessarily the same mass , i.e.  lens cross - section .",
    "suppose we have two galaxies with identical isothermal density profiles and identical velocity dispersions , @xmath41 , inside the fiber aperture , but different masses ( with m@xmath95@xmath96m@xmath97 ) .",
    "because the first galaxy is less massive , the stellar component must be more extended to maintain a similar velocity dispersion inside the aperture .",
    "we find that for the range r@xmath98 ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) the decrease in mass , and therefore lens cross - section , is about 5% for a fixed @xmath41 .",
    "whether this bias can partly explain the observed bias , or whether other mechanisms are also important , is not clear and we leave a full analysis to a future paper .",
    "in this section , we combine the projected 2d mass - measurement ( m@xmath66 ; see  2 ) with the stellar velocity dispersion measurement from sdss spectroscopy ( @xmath41 ) and the surface brightness distribution from the hst images ( see papers i & ii ) , to determine the 3d logarithmic density slope inside the einstein radius of each galaxy .",
    "we model each early - type galaxy as a spherical system , previously discussed in koopmans & treu ( 2003 ) and treu & koopmans ( 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "the modeling is done according to a number of steps and assumptions :    * the stellar plus dark - matter mass distribution of each of the lens galaxies is modeled as @xmath99 where @xmath100 can be uniquely determined from the projected mass m@xmath101@xmath102m@xmath50 and @xmath103 can be set arbitrarily . in ",
    "3.5 we discuss in more detail why we make this assumption for the familiy of total - density profiles .",
    "the only remaining free parameter in the density distribution is therefore the logarithmic density slope @xmath104 [ note that @xmath105 . as discussed in tk04 , the results are very insensitive to a cutoff at large radii ( i.e. beyond several effective radii ) in the dynamical analysis . *",
    "the stellar component is treated as a massless tracer ( i.e. @xmath106 ) in the gravitational potential of the total density profile .",
    "we assume a stellar density @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the total stellar mass ( assumed to be zero in the limit ) , @xmath109 is a break - radius and @xmath110 in the inner logarithmic stellar - density slope .",
    "for the hernquist ( 1990 ) profile @xmath111 and @xmath112 , such that half of the projected light is inside @xmath113 .",
    "the projected hernquist profile closely resembles an @xmath114 profile with which we determined the effective radii of each lens galaxy ( see paper ii ) . in case of the jaffe ( 1983 ) profile , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the two profiles delineate a range of possible models , bracketing the observed range of galaxy profiles , useful to test for potential systematics .",
    "* given the total density ( i.e.  gravitational potential ) and the luminosity density , we solve the spherical jeans equations ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) , to determine the line - of - sight stellar velocity dispersion as function of radius .",
    "the calculations are done assuming different ( constant ) values for the velocity anisotropy of the stellar orbits ( see e.g.  gerhard et al .",
    "2001 ) with @xmath117 .",
    "tangential anisotropy has @xmath118 , whereas radial anisotropy has @xmath119 . * both seeing and aperture effects are accounted for in the dynamical models .",

    "this is a very small _ intrinsic _ spread of only 6% around the average value , considering that many effects have not yet been accounted for .",
    "we comment that the small intrinsic scatter in @xmath104 of around 6% suggests that these low - redshift ( @xmath36 ) massive early - type galaxies could be ideal for measuring h@xmath38 from time - delays , with an expected rms scatter of around 12% between systems if they are assumed to be perfectly isothermal ( tk04 ) . at higher redshifts  where both external shear and convergence from the group and/or large - scale - structure environment of the lens galaxies become more important ",
    "the same assumption can lead to a larger ( i.e.  around 30% ) systematic scatter in h@xmath38 ( see tk04 for a full discussion ) .",
    "we note also that we measure the average density slope _ inside _",
    "r@xmath50 , whereas the time - delay depends on the local density slope _ inside the annulus _ between the lensed images ( kochanek 2002 ) , which could have a different value and most likely a larger scatter ( because it is not averaged ) .",
    "the assumption of an isothermal lens mass model ( see  2.1 ) systematically affects the mass determination of the lens galaxy inside its einstein radius at most at the few - percent level ( see kochanek 1991 and  3.4 ) . in addition",

    "n case of sdss j1402 + 634 ( bolton et al.2005 ) , for example , we found a random error of @xmath183% .",
    "we expect the other slacs systems to have much smaller errors because of their typically much higher s / n - ratio images . ] .",
    "the alignment of mass and light (  2.4 ) also suggests that the remaining degeneracies in the mass model are too small to lead to a biased mass estimate [ on average ] .",
    "in the rest of this section we show that residual errors on the lensing - based mass determination within the critical line are negligible with respect to the measurement errors on the stellar velocity dispersion . in the spherically symmetric case with power - law dependencies for the luminosity density and total density , one can show ( koopmans 2004 ) that the fractional error @xmath134 is related to those on the mass ( @xmath133 ) and the measured stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath41 ) by @xmath135\\right)\\cdot \\delta_{\\gamma ' } \\nonumber\\\\    & \\equiv & \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\delta_{{\\rm m}_{\\rm einst } } + \\alpha_g     \\cdot \\delta_{\\gamma'}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which one finds ( assuming independent errors ) @xmath136 here @xmath137 is typically of order a few and the function @xmath138 depends on the logarithmic slopes of the total and luminosity density profiles and @xmath139 ( see koopmans 2004 for its full expression in terms of gamma - functions ) .",
    "the pre - factor of four and the typical fractional errors on @xmath140 from sdss spectroscopy ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) , implies that @xmath141 can be neglected given the current kinematic data quality .",
    "the fractional error on the logarithmic density slope is therefore , to first order , equal to the fractional error on the measured stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "even though the hernquist and jaffe luminosity density functions follow a broken power - law (  3.1 ) , this relation holds in our joint lensing and dynamical analysis with a fractional spread in density slopes @xmath104 very close to that in stellar velocity dispersions ( c.f .",
    "paper ii and tk04 ) .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainties in the current analysis are probably the unknown stellar velocity anisotropy , the assumption of spherical symmetry in the dynamical models , deviations of the inner luminosity density profile from the assumed hernquist luminosity density profile and the possible contribution to the mass inside the einstein radius by the surrounding field galaxies .    to assess some of these uncertainties , we redo our analysis for a change of anisotropy parameters @xmath142 $ ] ( with a hernquist profile ) .",
    "the resulting change in the average value of @xmath104 is relatively small @xmath143 $ ] .",
    "similarly , if we assume a jaffe ( 1983 ) luminosity density profile , we find @xmath144 ( assuming @xmath124 ) .    because of their comparable scales , the small value of @xmath130 could partly be due to some remaining systematic effects .",
    "we note that the ensemble could also be more radially anisotropic ( e.g.  gerhard et al .",
    "2001 ) and/or have a luminosity density cusp steeper than hernquist , but the above analysis shows these systematic shifts in @xmath104 to be @xmath145 for reasonable assumptions .",
    "we note also that the small intrinsic spread in @xmath104 , in principle , allows us to set an upper limit on the average anisotropy of their velocity ellipsoid , using the tensor virial theorem ( binney  1978 ; sandy  faber and chris  kochanek , private communications ) .",
    "this could potentially lead to a correlation between the stellar mass ellipticity and its velocity dispersion and therefore with the inferred density slope . to test this , we plot @xmath104 against @xmath14 in fig.[fig : plotcorr ] : no significant correction is found and the effect must therefore be small . we defer a more thorough analysis to a future publication , that will make additional use of more detailed kinematic data obtained from ifs observations of several of the slacs lens galaxies and two - integral dynamical models .    if the field around the lens galaxies contributes significantly to the enclosed mass ( i.e.  to the convergence inside the einstein radius ) , it biases @xmath104 to lower values , if not accounted for ( see e.g.tk04 for a discussion ) .",
    "there are several reasons why we believe this contribution to be relative small for the slacs lens systems .",
    "first , we found that each systems can be modeled as a sie without requiring significant external shear .",
    "in general the strength of the shear equals roughly the convergence of the field ( if dominated by only a few systems ) .",
    "second , because slacs lens systems are at relatively low redshifts compared to lens systems known to date ( typically at @xmath146 ) , the angular distance between the lens galaxies and their nearest neighbors ( in units of the einstein radius ) is larger than at higher redshift .",
    "consequently , the influence of the field on the lens system is lower by a least a factor of a few compared to high-@xmath0 systems ( e.g.  paper ii ) .",
    "in addition , because the external convergence @xmath147 lowers the mass fractionally by @xmath148 , we find from equation  [ eq : relerr ] that @xmath149 .",
    "hence , even a high external shear or convergence of 0.1  easily detectable by the lens models  would affect @xmath104 at most at the @xmath185% level ( for typical @xmath150 ) . on average ,",
    "however , the expected external convergence is only a few percent ( e.g.  fassnacht & lubin 2002 ; keeton & zabludoff 2004 ; dalal & watson 2004 ) , reducing its influence to less than a few percent .",
    "another systematic uncertainty could stem from the determination of @xmath41 from the sdss spectrum .",
    "if sdss velocity dispersions were systematically biased , this would skew @xmath104 in one or the other direction , although there is no reason to assume this bias exists . moreover , bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimate systematic uncertainties on the measured velocity dispersions of @xmath963% .",
    "the ongoing ifs observations , discussed above , will allows us to rigorously test this .      finally , the most serious assumption is the shape of the density - profile itself (  3.1 ) , i.e. a power - law .",
    "this assumption can be tested , however . if either the density profiles of lens galaxies are different from a power - law , but have the same shape for each galaxy ( scaled to a common scale ) , or , if they are different from a power - law _ and _ different between lens galaxies , in both cases one expects the inferred ( average ) logarithmic density slope inside r@xmath50 to change with the ratio ( r@xmath50/r@xmath151 ) . for example , if the profile is a broken power - law with a change in slope inside r@xmath50 , one expects @xmath104 to change depending on where the change in slope occurs with respect to the effective radius .",
    "one would find some `` average '' slope weighed by luminosity and kinematic profile , and expect this to change as function of ( r@xmath50/r@xmath152 ) , because r@xmath50 depends mostly on the relative distances of the lens and the source and is not a physical scale of the lens galaxy itself .",
    "the absence of any clear systematic correlation between @xmath104 and this ratio ( see fig.5 ) , however , shows that this is not the case .",
    "the small deviations of @xmath104 from 2.0 further support this (  3.2 ) .",
    "we conclude that the assumption of a single power - law shape for the total density profile is valid at the level warranted by the current data .      the spatially resolved kinematic profile and the high - quality data of _ hst _ allowed tk04 to do separate analyses of the luminous and dark matter in individual early - type lens galaxies . the larger sdss fiber aperture , the absence of spatially resolved information , and the higher stellar mass fraction inside r@xmath50 prevent us from performing a similarly precise analysis .",
    "this will require higher spatial resolution kinematic data ( e.g.  with integral - field spectroscopy ) and is left for future work .",
    "despite this limitation , we can still infer an average dark - matter mass fraction inside the einstein radii of the ensemble of systems , keeping some caveats in mind ( see discussion below ) . to do this , we first solve the spherical jeans equation for two - component mass models , assuming a hernquist luminosity density profile scaled by a stellar mass - to - light ratio , plus a dark - matter density component with density profile @xmath153 , and assuming that @xmath154 ( see koopmans & treu 2003 and treu & koopmans 2002 , 2004 for more details ) .",
    "the sum of both mass components must be m@xmath50 inside the einstein radius .",
    "this leads to a likelihood grid as function of stellar @xmath155 and dark - matter density slope @xmath156 ( see e.g.  tk04 ) .",
    "second , a gaussian prior is set on the value of @xmath155 , assuming an average local restframe b - band stellar mass - to - light ratio of 7.3  @xmath157 with a 1@xmath24 of 2.1  @xmath158 ( e.g.  gerhard et al .",
    "2001 ; see also tk04 ) and correcting this for the average passive evolution of @xmath159 found from the sample in paper ii , which brightens galaxies with increasing redshift .",
    "the luminosity corrections are small ( @xmath160 ) , however , for slacs galaxies at redshifts below 0.33 .",
    "finally , we marginalize the resulting probability distribution ( including the mass - to - light ratio prior ) over @xmath156 to obtain the likelihood function of the dark - matter mass fraction inside r@xmath50 : @xmath161 . the stellar mass fraction @xmath162 is given by the maximum - likelihood value of @xmath155 divided by the maximum allowed value of @xmath155 ] .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the straight average of @xmath164 is found to be @xmath165 ( rms of 0.22 ) inside @xmath69kpc ( rms of 1.6kpc ) with a large range between about 0% to 60% .",
    "we note that none of the stellar mass - to - light ratios significantly exceeds the maximum set by the inequality m@xmath166 , which can be regarded as an additional ( although weak ) check on the validity of our assumptions . finally , we investigate whether the dark - matter fraction ( @xmath161 ) inside the einstein radius correlates with other lens properties . in fig.2 , we plot @xmath167 against @xmath86 and do indeed find a correlation ( correlation coefficient @xmath168 ) .",
    "this correlation is predominantly due to the low inferred dark - matter mass fraction in the low - mass ( i.e.  low dispersion ) galaxies , whereas the higher mass systems seem to have @xmath169 .",
    "this correlation can either be true , i.e.  low - mass galaxies have less dark matter in their inner regions ( napolitano et al .",
    "2005 ) , or be a result of the break - down of one of our assumptions .    we think that the latter is the most likely explanation , because the three lowest - mass systems with @xmath170 ( all s0 galaxies ) have values of @xmath171 , suggesting that dark matter contributes significantly to their inner regions similar to spiral galaxies .",
    "in fact , the assumption of a constant stellar @xmath172 ratio , independent of @xmath86 , is probably not entrirely correct . within the `` down - sizing '' scenario which leads to a tilt in the fundamental plane ( see e.g.  paper ii ) , a lower stellar @xmath173 ratio is expected for s0 galaxies .",
    "this leads to a lower inferred dark - matter mass fraction inside the einstein radius .",
    "in addition , we find no strong trend of dark - matter mass fraction with the ratio of einstein radius over effective radius ( fig.2 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the inferred values of @xmath167 only give a general indication . the other results in this paper , however , do not depend on the stellar @xmath172 assumption .",
    "as mentioned above , we are obtaining higher spatial resolution kinematic data to improve upon this without assuming a stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "in combination with results from the lenses structure & dynamics ( lsd ) survey ( koopmans & treu 2002 , 2003 ; treu & koopmans 2002 , 2004 ) and from two more lens systems for which stellar velocity dispersions are measured and analyzed in a homogenous way ( treu & koopmans 2002b ; koopmans et al .",

    "even though we indeed find isothermal mass density profiles , this is remarkable given the problems with violent relaxation models ( e.g.  arad & lynden - bell 2005 ; arad & johansson 2005 ) . if we were to consider formation via mergers of collisionless stellar systems ( i.e. `` dry mergers '' ) , as suggested by some authors ( e.g.  kochfar & burkert 2003 ; nipoti et al .",

    "2002 ; zhao et al .",
    "2003 ; gao et al .  2004 ; kazantzidis et al .",
    "the isothermal mass density profile of massive elliptical galaxies would therefore seem to imply that their `` dry '' progenitors must have had isothermal profiles as well , _",
    "ad infinitum_. clearly this sequence must break down somewhere , if one wants to reconcile our finding with the outcome of cosmological numerical simulations that indicate inner density cusps with logarithmic density slopes around 1.01.5 for collisionless mergers",

    "[ [ hierarchical - dry - merging - of - collisionally - collapsed - gas - rich - progenitors ] ] hierarchical dry merging of collisionally collapsed gas - rich progenitors ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    to bring all the different pieces of evidence for and against gas - poor or gas - rich formation scenarios together and in agreement with the observations from the slacs and lsd samples , we consider the following scenario :    \\(1 ) at a redshift of approximately 1.5 or 2 , most of the stellar populations in the inner regions of the massive slacs / lsd early - type galaxies appear to have been in place already ( or was accreted below that redshift through dry mergers ) , as indicated by their red colors and slow evolution at @xmath30 ( paper ii and kt04 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the dominant old stellar population implies that gas accretion and subsequent star - formation can only have played a minor role at lower redshifts ( e.g.  trager et al .",
    "2000 ; treu et al.2002 ) .",
    "the effect on the inner density slope from adiabatic contraction , resulting from infall of gas - rich satellites , should therefore be relatively small as well .",
    "if the latter were important and continued below @xmath205 , it could severely affect the evolution of the logarithmic density slope , which seems to change at most marginally  (  4 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) once gas was no longer being accreted , the invariance of the inner density profile ( e.g.  dehnen 2005 ;  6.1.1 ) implies that at redshifts above 1.5 or 2 , the inner regions of these galaxies were already in dynamical equilibrium ( e.g.  wechsler et al",
    ".  2002 ; zhao et al .  2003 ; gao et al .  2004 ; kazantzidis et al .  2005 )",
    ". major or minor collisionless mergers might , however , still occur and replace already present collisionless matter ( gao et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) combining this with the result presented in this paper that the inner cores are very close to isothermal with little intrinsic scatter (  3.2 ; also found by gerhard et al .",
    "2001 at @xmath206 ) implies that these cores must have been isothermal already at the time significant gas - accretion ceased to occur at redshifts of 1.5 or 2 or higher .",
    "\\(5 ) the results from numerical simulations ( e.g.  navarro et al.1996 ; moore et al .",
    "1998 ) , however , suggest that collisionless mergers in a @xmath25cdm cosmology lead to a much more shallow density profile , never to anything that even remotely resembles an isothermal profile . we are now faced with a conundrum when trying to explain an isothermal density profile in a dissipationless scenario , whether the merging matter is dark or stellar .",
    "this string of arguments suggests that the isothermal nature of the inner regions of massive early - type galaxies must , somehow , be the result of the effects of gas - accretion ( e.g.  through mergers ) and subsequent ( adiabatic ) contraction and star formation . during these collisional stages in the galaxy - formation process , the sum of the stellar and dark matter distribution converged to an isothermal density profile through an as yet unknown process .",
    "some of the collisionless matter in the inner regions could be expelled by newly in - falling dark or stellar matter , redistributing it such that the phase - space density remains nearly invariant ( e.g.  gao et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "this process either occurred rapidly , and only once , for the early - type galaxy in the `` monolithic '' collapse scenario ( e.g.eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) or in the merging of gas - rich disk galaxies , _ or _",
    "it occurred for each of its progenitors , which then hierarchically and collisionlessly merged .",
    "once the gas supply was depleted , subsequent dry mergers would retain the isothermality of the density profile .",
    "the suggested scenario is therefore one where monolithic collapse or gas - rich disk - galaxy merging occurred for the _ progenitors _ of present - day early - type galaxies ( only once in the particular case of the traditional monolithic collapse ! ) leading to an isothermal density profile .",
    "the resulting gas - poor galaxies subsequently merged collisionlessly , leaving the density profiles of the merger products unchanged .",
    "understanding whether this can work , requires detailed numerical calculations , including baryons and feedback in a realistic way .",
    "these are only recently becoming available ( e.g.  meza et al.2003 ; kobayashi 2005 ) and still include approximations for many physical processes .",
    "as for observational tests , this hypothetical scenario predicts that the inner regions of massive early - type galaxies already became isothermal ( in density ) at the formation redshift of the old stellar population .",
    "this will be testable if early - type lens galaxies ( or their progenitors ) are discovered at redshifts of @xmath207 in future large - scale surveys e.g.  with the ska or the lsst ( e.g.  koopmans , browne & jackson 2004 ) and their density profiles can be quantified either through lensing or lensing and dynamics combined .        1 .",
    "_ what is the physical process that leads to an average isothermal stellar plus dark - matter density profile in the inner regions of massive early - type galaxies at @xmath208 ? _",
    "the scenario discussed in  6.2 argues that it most likely is a collisional process .",
    "_ why does this process lead to such a remarkably small scatter in the logarithmic ( stellar plus dark - matter ) density slope in their inner regions ? _",
    "if collisional processes play a dominant role in this , as suggested above , it requires strong feedback and an attractor - like behaviour .",
    "also , subsequent dry mergers can not increase the scatter significantly ( e.g.  dehnen 2005 ) , suggesting that they have very similar isothermal density profiles .",
    "_ why does the mass structure in the inner regions of massive elliptical galaxies evolve so little below a redshift of one ? _",
    "this suggests that these galaxies are already dynamically in place at @xmath209 and that the evolution of their mass structure , through subsequent merging , plays only a minor role in their inner regions and must predominantly be dry .",
