    "@xcite ) , it is still a factor of 7 higher than expected .",
    "moreover , this is the required number only for the disk sources and would involve almost 1.5 m@xmath2 in massive stars with a salpeter imf and , by this , would require a moderately high sfr of about 15 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 in the disk .",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding supernova typeii ( ) rate ( 0.1 yr@xmath3 ) should contribute to the x - ray emission via hot gas .",
    "the single component models bs and rs show similar results .",
    "consequently , we only achieve an adequate fit of rs with very low metallicity , e.g. the portion of emission lines to the spectrum is very small .",
    "in contrast , it is expected that emission lines of highly ionized elements , like fe and mg , should play an important role in the x - ray spectrum of  in starburst regions because of the nucleosynthesis of massive  progenitor stars ( woosley & weaver @xcite ) . in both models",

    "so only the combined information from the pspc and hri data allows a more detailed interpretation of the x - ray results .",
    "several points speak against the single po component model , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ specfit ] .",
    "a more likely scenario is a composition of several different emission sources , like an active nucleus , hmxbs , and supernova remnants ( snrs ) . in the following",
    "we will therefore discuss a composite emission model and the comparison with the uv and optical observations of the galactic core .      as can be discerned from the hri image ( fig .",
    "[ hrisrcareas ] and table  [ tabhrisources ] ) , most of the x - ray emission of ngc  4303 ( 83% ) comes from the central region of the galaxy .",
    "three different pictures are imaginable for the nucleus : a central active nucleus , a central or circumnuclear region with enhanced star formation , or a combination of both phenomena .",
    "any of these cases requires a sufficient gas density at the galactic center .",
    "this can be achieved by a barred potential which triggers radial gas flow from the outer regions toward the nucleus . on the other hand , from numerical simulations including",
    "gas dynamics bar formation has proved to be only a transient phenomenon ( combes @xcite ) . in this picture , the galactic bar will be destroyed by the gas inflow after only a few cycles .",
    "a new bar - phase can follow this gas infall due to a subsequent gravitational instability from the accreted central mass .",
    "the problem with this picture is the contradiction of a necessary gas inflow to form and feed any nuclear activity ( starburst and/or agn ) and the fact that this gas inflow destroys the bar .",
    "it seems that a sufficiently massive black hole can provide for its fuelling ( fukuda et al .",
    "@xcite ) . another efficient way for gas to flow further into the center is a second smaller bar embedded into the first one due to a second inner lindblad resonance ( friedli & martinet @xcite ) . in some cases ,",
    "a gaseous circumnuclear ring is formed at the end of the second bar .",
    "the concentrated x - ray emission from the galactic core in ngc  4303 may originate from an agn and/or a nuclear or circumnuclear starburst .",
    "a starburst can contribute in two different ways to the x - ray flux .",
    "first , the produced star population contains hmxbs , emitting an x - ray radiation in spectral shape similar to an agn .",
    "hmxbs can not be distinguished from agn in the rosat data .",
    "additionally , high - mass stars ( above @xmath4810 m@xmath2 ) evolve to  at an age of @xmath410@xmath29 yr , depending on their initial mass .",
    "the  from one star cluster form a cumulative expanding superbubble filled with hot gas which can be described by a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum and additional emission lines and recombination edges of highly ionized heavy elements produced in high - mass stars and released by their  explosions , e.g. o , ne , mg , si , and fe . theoretical models for the spectral emission of such a hot diffuse gas are meka ( mewe et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the model by raymond & smith ( @xcite ) , which we used in our spectral fit .",
    "if we apply a two - component model to describe the x - ray spectrum of ngc  4303 , the comparison of the flux ratio from the nucleus ( 83% in the hri ) and the disk sources ( 17% in the hri ) suggests that the central source can be described by the power - law component ( 87% in the spectral fit ) .",
    "the thermal rs emission exclusively originates from the disk sources , indicating ongoing star formation . to consider the possible extension of @xmath425  of the central source , as represented by the lowest contours",
    ", it is imaginable that a small fraction of the x - ray flux is emitted by a circumnuclear starburst at a distance of @xmath41 kpc around the core .",
    "this would add a thermal component to the non - thermal x - ray nucleus .",
    "on the other hand , a fraction of the x - ray flux from the disk sources may come from hmxbs within these star forming regions .",
    "fuelling an agn on scales of a few parsec at the center of the galaxy leads to the problem of reducing the angular momentum of the central gas by several orders of magnitude , as dynamical simulations show ( barnes & hernquist @xcite ) . concentration of gas in a ring - like feature around the nucleus with a radius of @xmath41 kpc is dynamically much easier to achieve .",
    "the hri image agrees with the picture of an extended x - ray source with a diameter of the order of @xmath42 kpc at the galactic center of ngc  4303 , explained by a circumnuclear starburst region with an additional possible compact nuclear source.the decovered massive rotating circumnuclear disk in ngc  4303 can provide by its spiral - like structure of massive star forming regions an effective mechanism to channel gas from the circumnuclear regions further down to the nucleus to feed the agn .",
    "but one has to consider that the spiral structure in the uv has a diamater of only 225 pc , while the extension of the central x - ray source is about 2 kpc in diameter .",
    "the spiral feature detected in the uv can not be resolved with the hri .    from the analysis of uv and optical magnitudes and colors of the central 250 pc colina & wada ( @xcite ) estimated ages of 525 myr for the star - forming regions .",
    "consequently a contribution to the central x - ray flux from snrs and cumulatively expanding hot gas has to be expected .",
    "the question remains whether we observe a pure nucleus of massive star - forming clusters or a composition of these star clusters and a low luminous agn . if ngc  4303 contains a non - thermal active nucleus , the x - ray luminosity of 4 erg s@xmath3 points to only a low luminous agn ( liner ) .",
    "koratkar et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 for low luminous agns of @xmath0/@xmath30 14 .",
    "prez - olea & colina ( @xcite ) investigated the correlation between optical and x - ray luminosities of several agns with circumnuclear star - forming rings , pure agns , and pure starburst galaxies .",
    "the pure starbursts in their galaxy sample show @xmath0/@xmath1 values of 0.030.3 , 100 times smaller than for pure agns .",
    "if we take the h@xmath31 luminosity of ngc  4303 derived by keel ( @xcite ) and assume that 10% originate from the nucleus , we get log @xmath1(nucleus ) = 39.2 ( adopted for a distance of 16.1 mpc ) .",
    "therefore the x - ray - to - h@xmath31 ratio amounts to log(@xmath0/@xmath1 ) = 1.4 , which agrees with the value found by koratkar et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "even the lower @xmath0 value from a single rs model ( @xmath42.5 erg s@xmath3 for the nucleus ) results in log(@xmath0/@xmath1 ) = 1.2 .",
    "typical pure starburst galaxies show h@xmath31 luminosities of the order of their x - ray luminosities or higher .      at first glance",
    "the optical disk of ngc  4303 seems to have the quite symmetrical morphology of a late - type spiral .",
    "a closer look reveals that the eastern spiral arm of the galaxy has a much more prominent form with a boomerang - like shape and a lot more bright emission regions than the western counterpart .",
    "the northern disk shows a complex structure with many separate features .",
    "this asymmetry is more discernible in the h@xmath31 image .",
    "the   regions are mainly located in the northern part of the disk at the junction of the bar with the eastern spiral arm and along that arm .",
    "a close encounter of one or both of the nearby galaxies ngc  4303a and ngc  4292 may have caused these features .",
    "the interaction within the virgo cluster is another possible source .",
    "infall into the intracluster medium could cause ram pressure effects .",
    "nevertheless , ngc  4303 is located at the outer edge of the cluster , which may produce only a moderate disturbance .",
    "this agrees with the  distribution over the whole optical disk .",

    "c and f within the galactic disk of ngc  4303 are located at the ends of the bar .",
    "gas dynamical simulations of barred galaxies have shown this accumulation due to mass flows along the bar to the center and to the ends of the bar , respectively ( noguchi @xcite ; englmaier & gerhard @xcite ) .",
    "the increased densities lead to enhanced star formation .    from the low inclination of ngc  4303",
    "no direct information can be obtained whether the disk is warped or not .",
    "but it is striking that source d lies exactly at the bend of the eastern boomerang - shaped arm .",
    "this may indicate that this x - ray source is caused by the tidal force leading to a local gas concentration .",
    "another indirect hint for a past interaction comes from the spectra of the qso 1219 + 047 ( source no .  7 in fig .",

    "a more detailed determiation of the sfr , for example using an analytic suberbubble model by suchkov et a. ( @xcite ) , would need information about the extensions and expansion time of the superbubbles , in order to determine the mechanical energy release by the sne and , by this , the sn rate .",
    "this can be compared with the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "besides the mentioned restrictions the difference between the sfr estimated from the x - ray flux and the sfr derived by the h@xmath31 flux by kennicutt ( @xcite ) ( 14 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 ) may be due to several reasons .",
    "kennicutt used a miller - scalo imf which increases the sfr by a factor of about 1.5 .",

    "@xcite ) leads to a 3.8 times higher luminosity than taking the distance of 16.1 mpc which we used .",
    "additionally , the fact that not all  regions may emit an adequate x - ray flux or are not strong enough to be detected lowers the estimated sfr from the x - ray luminosity which implies the existence of high - mass stars having been evolved to .",
    "possible x - ray emission from diffuse hot gas within the disk may lie below the detection limit of 1.1 cts s@xmath3 arcsec@xmath34 ( 5@xmath35 above background level ) .",

    "<S> the late - type galaxy ngc  4303 ( m61 ) is one of the most intensively studied barred galaxies in the virgo cluster . </S>",
    "<S> its prominent enhanced star formation throughout large areas of the disk can be nicely studied due to its low inclination of about 27 .    </S>",
    "<S> we present observations of ngc  4303 with the rosat pspc and hri in the soft x - ray ( 0.12.4 kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of the x - ray emission is located at the nuclear region . </S>",
    "<S> it contributes more than 80% to the total observed soft x - ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the central x - ray source and the @xmath0/@xmath1 ratio point to a low luminous agn ( liner ) with a circumnuclear star - forming region . </S>",
    "<S> several separate disk sources can be distinguished with the hri , coinciding spatially with some of the most luminous  regions outside the nucleus of ngc  4303 . </S>",
    "<S> the total star formation rate amounts to 12 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray structure follows the distribution of star formation with enhancement at the bar - typical patterns .    </S>",
    "<S> the best spectral fit consists of a power - law component ( agn and hmxbs ) and a thermal plasma component of hot gas from supernova remnants and superbubbles . </S>",
    "<S> the total 0.12.4 kev luminosity of ngc  4303 amounts to 5 erg s@xmath3 , consistent with comparable galaxies , like e.g. ngc  4569 . </S>"
