    "the interplay between superconductivity and magnetic order is a long - standing issue which interest has been enhanced by the discovery of the so - called magnetic superconductors , materials where the coupling between both collective states is weak , as it is also the case of the high temperature cuprate superconductors ( htsc).@xcite the weak diamagnetism induced by thermal fluctuations above the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath3 ) is a useful tool to probe some aspects of such interplay , because it does not hide the contribution associated with the magnetic order , as it may be the case below @xmath4.@xcite as an example , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the introduction of magnetic impurities in low-@xmath3 metallic superconductors ( ltsc ) leads to an increase of the precursor diamagnetism well beyond the uncertainties associated with the normal - state contribution or with possible @xmath3 inhomogeneities .",
    "this increase , which was found to be proportional to the impurities concentration , was interpreted in terms of an indirect effect associated to a change in the magnetic coupling between impurities due to the presence of fluctuating cooper pairs.@xcite for ltsc this mechanism was earlier proposed for temperatures below @xmath3.@xcite    here we probe the effect of magnetic impurities on the fluctuation diamagnetism above @xmath3 in htsc , an issue that to our knowledge still remains unaddressed . for that , we have studied the prototypical yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) with cu partially replaced by ni or zn , or with y partially replaced by magnetic rare - earths like gd or pr .",
    "nonmagnetic zn@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) substitutes cu@xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) in the cuo@xmath0 layers,@xcite producing a local magnetic moment on the four nearest - neighbors cu sites arising from the local suppression of short - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations.@xcite this magnetic moment is evidenced by the presence of a curie - like term in the bulk magnetic susceptibility.@xcite on the other hand , as determined by x - ray absortion experiments,@xcite magnetic ni substitutes cu nearly uniformly in both the cuo@xmath0 layers and the cuo chains .",
    "both zn and ni impurities in the cuo@xmath8 layers act as strong pairbreakers and are very effective in reducing @xmath4.@xcite in contrast , the out - of - plane substitution of y by a magnetic rare - earth leaves @xmath4 almost unaffected@xcite except in the case of pr , which in an amount of @xmath9% completely suppresses the superconductivity.@xcite our measurements then cover in - plane and out - of - plane magnetic substitutions with very different influences on the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "our experimental results show that , in contrast with the ltsc , in ybco the precursor diamagnetism is not appreciably affected by the presence of magnetic impurities .",
    "although it is beyond the central aim of our work , we will also show that by just taking into account the @xmath3 dependence on the impurities concentration , the observed magnetization roundings above @xmath3 may be explained by conventional mean - field gaussian - ginzburg - landau ( ggl ) approaches.@xcite",

    "finally , they were held at @xmath15c in flowing oxygen several days to attain an oxygen doping level close to the optimal one ( @xmath16 ) .",
