    "the problem of finding a minimum vertex cover in a graph is one of the 21 np - hard problems identified by karp in 1972 , and has since been intensively studied in the literature .",

    "( poc ) of a graph @xmath4 as the ratio @xmath17 .",
    "hence we just showed that the price of connectivity of any graph lies in the interval @xmath18 .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the path on @xmath20 vertices and by @xmath21 the cycle on @xmath20 vertices .",
    "note that the upper bound in ( [ eqn general poc ] ) is asymptotically sharp in the class of paths and in the class of cycles , in the sense that @xmath22    our contribution is split into two parts . in the first part",
    ", we consider the computational complexity of the problem of deciding whether the poc of a graph given as input is bounded by some constant @xmath0 .",
    "we show the completeness of this problem with respect to a well - defined complexity class in the polynomial hierarchy . in the second part ,",
    "we investigate graph classes in which the poc _ of every induced subgraph _ is bounded by a constant @xmath0 with @xmath23 . those classes will be defined by forbidden induced subgraphs .",
    "the forbidden subgraph characterizations directly yields polynomial - time algorithms for recognizing graphs in those classes .",
    "we use the following standard notation .",

    "the price of connectivity ( as defined here ) has been introduced by cardinal and levy  @xcite , who showed that it was bounded by @xmath28 in graphs with average degree @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the number of vertices .",
    "other ratios were previously studied . in a companion paper to the present paper , camby and schaudt  @xcite consider the price of connectivity for dominating set . recently , schaudt  @xcite studied the ratio between the connected domination number and the total domination number .",

    "thus , theorem  [ thm : t2c ] is a negative result : loosely speaking , it tells us that deciding whether the poc is bounded by some constant is as hard as computing both @xmath10 and @xmath11 explicitely . and this remains true even if the constant is not part of the input .",
