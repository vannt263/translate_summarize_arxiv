    "we can point out the main difference between the atomic and qdm systems : while usually we find @xmath32 for atoms , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for qdm .",
    "this difference will introduce a strong modification on the nonlinear behaviour of atoms and qdm as we discuss below .",
    "of course , one could find an atomic system in @xmath0-configuration where @xmath35 and then its optical response would be similar to that of the qdm we are analysing here .    we can easily obtain the steady state solution for the master equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) . considering different regimes of control ( tunnelling process ) and probe fields we immediately see expressive differences of the optical response for atomic and qdm systems , here quantified by _",

    "[ fig:1 ] we have considered @xmath38 for the atoms and @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the qdm , so that in both cases the total decay rate of the excited state @xmath41 is @xmath42 . throughout this work we have neglected the other decoherence and dissipation rates , i.e. , @xmath43 , since they are much smaller than the decay rates of the excited state and also because they destroy dark state of the system , thus making difficult the comparison between the optical responses of the atomic and qdm systems . we note that , when @xmath44 , i.e. , in the regime of parameters known as eit regime ( or even in the autler - townes regime ) , the optical response of the system is independent on the decay rate of the excited state @xmath9 to the ground state @xmath8 , as we can see in fig . [ fig:1 ] ( a ) .",
    "however , for @xmath45 , i.e. , in the regime known as cpt ( coherent population trapping ) we can see a strong difference between the atomic and qdm optical responses , as shown in fig . [ fig:1 ] ( c ) .",
    "the width of the transparency window is the same for both systems .",
    "however , the qdm presents higher absorption in the region around the transparency window .",
    "the origin of such difference is on the decay rate @xmath46 , which is non - null for the atomic system but null for qdm . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) and ( d ) we plot the populations of the states @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath49 ) for atomic and qdm systems ( the population of the excited state @xmath41 is close to zero in all cases ) , for eit and cpt regimes , respectively .",
    "again , there is an expressive difference between the behaviour of the populations of the atom and of the qdm in the cpt regime . in particular , for qdm the populations @xmath48 and @xmath49 are modified only for resonant probe field , i.e. , for @xmath50 .",

    "on the other hand , by solving the master equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) we are able to obtain the polarization density in terms of the density matrix elements @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) @xcite . by imposing @xmath63",
    "we can get the steady state solution of the master equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) , which allows us to obtain the @xmath60-order optical susceptibility @xcite which can be written as ( without a scaling factor ) : @xmath64    @xmath65    here , @xmath66 .",
    "the expressions above are valid for any values of @xmath13 and @xmath57 so that these results are valid in both eit and cpt regimes . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) we see that @xmath67 depends only on the total decay rate of the excited state @xmath9 ( @xmath68 ) , being not important the value of the decay rate @xmath46 alone .",

[ fig:2 ] where we plot @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) versus @xmath71 . through these results",
    "we see that @xmath46 enhances the nonlinear processes , mainly in the limit of @xmath78 .",

    "thus , the high nonlinear effects present in eit or cpt experiments are strongly related to the decay channel @xmath46 , which is associated to the transition coupled by the control field . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> we show that the origin of such difference relies on the different decay rates of the excited state of the two systems , implying in a strong difference on their higher order nonlinear susceptibilities . finally , we investigate the optical response of atom / qdm strongly coupled to a cavity mode </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , the qdm - cavity system has the advantage of allowing a better narrowing of the width of the dark state resonance in the cpt regime when compared with atom - cavity system .    </S>",

    "<S> optical nonlinear effects , such as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , result in the suppression of a weak probe field absorption in a narrow spectral window accompanied by an enhancement of its nonlinear susceptibility and an abrupt change of the refraction index @xcite . the electromagnetically induced transparency phenomenon is associated with another process named coherent population trapping ( cpt)@xcite , which is characterized by a dark state written as a coherent superposition of the ground states of the system . in this </S>",
    "<S> context , quantum interference and coherent effects have been widely investigated and demonstrated in various three - level systems in @xmath0-configuration , which can be modelled in atomic @xcite and semiconductor systems , for example coupled quantum dots ( qdm - quantum dot molecule ) @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> placing the atom or the qdm inside an optical cavity , their couplings with the probe field is replaced by coupling with a cavity mode ( strenght @xmath1 ) , which is driven by the probe laser . for practical proposes the interaction of single emitters ( atom or quantum dot ) with optical cavity modes has a fundamental role , enabling a significant enhancement of the light - matter coupling and the increase of the efficiency of photon collection . in the atom - cavity system </S>",
    "<S> the eit effect can be observed through the transmission spectrum of an incident laser field ( probe laser ) , which will be entirely transmitted at resonance if the control field is present @xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> it is important remind that the linewidth of the transmitted field depends on the ratio between the squares of the control field rabi frequency @xmath2 , and atom - cavity coupling @xmath1 @xcite , which is valid when there is no decay or dephasing on the atomic ground states and when the system is in the eit regime .    in this work </S>",

    "<S> , the control laser beam is replaced by the electron tunneling between the quantum dots ( with tunneling rate @xmath3 ) , which can be controlled by an external electric field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is known as tunneling induced transparency ( tit ) due to the critical role of tunneling in the appearance of transparency in qdm s @xcite and allows for applications similar to those we find in atomic systems , e.g. , slow down of light pulses @xcite or cavity linewidth narrowing @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results show a notable difference in the optical response of these systems when the rabi frequency of the probe laser is comparable or larger than the rabi frequency of the control field ( tunneling rate ) , i.e. , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> besides , we note a very appreciable difference in the transmission spectrum of the cavity when we have atom or qdm coupled to it and when we are in the limit @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively . in those limits and </S>",
    "<S> when all the fields are on resonance , while the transmission of the atom - cavity system reaches an empty cavity situation , the qdm - cavity presents an extremely narrow transmission peak . </S>",
    "<S> thus , here we show that qdm works out more efficiently to induce cavity - linewidth narrowing @xcite than atoms . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that these features occurs due to nonlinear effects , which become more pronounced in the weak control field limit ( cpt regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the crucial parameter which allows for the enhancement of the nonlinear effects in eit / cpt processes is the asymmetric decay rate of the excited state . </S>"
