    ", we showed that the wave functions do not have such a phase factor when they respectively stay in the left island @xmath4 and in the right island @xmath5 , namely , when there is no exchange between the wave functions living individual islands .",
    "actually , all the self - adjoint extensions of our minimal schrdinger operator @xmath2 can be parameterized by @xmath6 following the von neumann s theory . here",
    ", @xmath7 is the unitary group of the degree @xmath8 . in @xcite",

    ", we complete the result in @xcite .",
    "as asserted in theorem [ theo : main2 ] below , we will characterize the boundary conditions of all the self - adjoint extensions of the minimal schrdinger operator @xmath2 by just two types of boundary conditions proposed in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we will actually construct the boundary condition from every matrix of @xmath7 .",
    "we will then give a tunnel - junction formula concerning the phase factor for the non - relativistic electron as the schrdinger particle .",
    "we will propose a mathematical idea to make a qubit from a schrdinger particle through the tunnel - junction formula by controlling the phase factor , even though the spin of the schrdinger particle can not be used . in the case",
    "where the electron spin should be considered , we studied similar problem for a single relativistic electron as the dirac particle @xcite .",
    "first up , we prepare some mathematical tools and recall some results to state our main theorem , theorem [ theo : main2 ] .    we respectively define function spaces @xmath10 and @xmath11 for our configuration space @xmath12 by @xmath13 and @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the set of all the square lebesgue - integrable functions on @xmath12 , and @xmath16 denotes the boundary @xmath17 of @xmath12 .",

    ".    therefore , we have constructed the boundary matrix @xmath83 with the vector @xmath79 in the class ( class @xmath80 ) from every non - diagonal @xmath134 .",
