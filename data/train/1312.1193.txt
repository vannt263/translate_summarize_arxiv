    "we argue in appendix  [ app : poly - inhom ] that for inhomogeneities of essentially constant ( @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 ) or approximately linear ( @xmath239 ) behavior over a large part of the kinematical region of interest , the coefficients of the highest power in the subtraction polynomials ( @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath243 ) need to be adjusted in order to provide a reasonable high - energy behavior . with respect to @xmath148 ( taken as fixed and not particularly large here ) . assuming the large-@xmath45 behavior of the different form factors and partial waves is independent thereof , we indeed need to require the leading powers in @xmath45 to cancel between the dispersion integrals over the inhomogeneities and the subtraction polynomial . ]",
    "these coefficients are given by the derivative of the corresponding omns function at @xmath220 , multiplied with the constant / the derivative of the inhomogeneity in question . obviously , the hat functions are not exactly constant / linear : to the contrary , they include square - root singularities at @xmath220 due to the left - hand cut .",
    "there is , therefore , necessarily an uncertainty due to the choice of a `` matching point '' @xmath244 at which to evaluate these `` constants , '' @xmath245 we choose @xmath246 , due to the expected strong enhancement of the distribution at the @xmath5 resonance peak . here ,",
    "all other subtraction constants do not receive `` hat '' contributions .",
    "the second contribution to the subtraction constants , dominantly to those of _",
    "low _ polynomial order in @xmath45 , stems from matching to the nonpole part of the chiral amplitude eq .  , which yields ( for fixed @xmath46 ) a polynomial contribution in @xmath45 . in this exploratory study we use the leading - order expressions only .",
    "we expect the chiral expansion to converge best at the sub - threshold point @xmath220 , as opposed to , e.g. , the @xmath4 threshold  @xcite .    as we match the dispersive representation eq .   to the leading chiral tree - level amplitude , which does not contain any rescattering or loop corrections , we identify the subtraction constants @xmath248 , @xmath249 by setting the scattering phases to zero , i.e. , @xmath250 , and the dispersive integrals over the inhomogeneities vanish . at @xmath220",

    ", we have varied this coupling within its assumed uncertainty , @xmath258 .",
    "remember that @xmath259 and @xmath260 consist of @xmath83 pole terms only at leading order : this pole dominance should have very favorable consequences for the reliability of the form factor prediction , as the pole contributions are essentially fixed by the coupling constant @xmath110 ( as well as @xmath124 ) beyond the chiral expansion ; the latter affects only the precision of the polynomial contribution .",
    "next - to - leading - order corrections to the residues of the pole terms seem to have surprisingly little effect .",
    "the @xmath4 phase shifts are known to sufficient accuracy in the region @xmath261 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to ensure the assumed asymptotic behavior @xmath262 for @xmath263",
    ", we continue the phases beyond @xmath264 according to the prescription  @xcite @xmath265 there is a further subtlety concerning the @xmath62-wave phase shift : as we have discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic ] , the elastic approximation breaks down at the @xmath13 threshold @xmath88 with the occurrence of the @xmath89 resonance . both the phase of the partial wave @xmath266 and , e.g. , the phase of the nonstrange scalar form factor of the pion @xmath267 differ significantly from @xmath268 in this region : they quickly drop and then roughly follow the energy dependence of @xmath268 again , with @xmath269  @xcite .",
    "therefore a single - channel approximation to the pion scalar form factor only works for @xmath270 if a phase of the form of either @xmath271 or @xmath267 are used as input to the omns function instead of @xmath268 .",
    "we use such a form factor phase taken from ref .",
    "obviously , we can not provide a reliable description of pion  pion rescattering effects where the inherent two - channel nature of the problem becomes important , hence our dispersive description is confined to below @xmath88 .    with the phase shift input thus continued formally up to infinity , the omns integrals can be fully performed .",
    "we have checked that different continuation prescriptions from the one given in eq .   above @xmath264",
    "have very little impact on the physics at low energies , i.e. , below 1gev .",
    "the phase input allows us to evaluate the derivatives of the omns functions required in eq .   via the sum rules @xmath272 leading to @xmath273 , @xmath274",
    "this corresponds to squared radii of the pion scalar and vector form factors @xmath275 , @xmath276 , both only around 5% below the central values of more sophisticated evaluations  @xcite .    in order to ensure numerically stable results ,",
    "we perform the dispersion integrals over the inhomogeneities eq .   up to @xmath277gev .",
    "this upper limit of the integration does not have any real physical significance : it merely represents an attempt to sum up the high - energy remainder of the integral to reasonable approximation , and does not mean we pretend to understand @xmath4 interactions at such scales .",

    "@xcite in the context of heavy - meson chiral perturbation theory . concerning the different @xmath14  waves , we find that the kinematical prefactor @xmath282 strongly suppresses the partial wave @xmath180 or the form factor @xmath59 for the values of @xmath46 considered here . of the other two ,",
    "@xmath179 yields a contribution to the differential rate roughly twice as large as @xmath217 .",
    "we wish to emphasize that matching to chiral perturbation theory at leading order can only be considered an estimate , and mainly serves for illustration purposes here .",
    "higher - order corrections are expected to be significant .",
    "ultimately , the subtraction constants that influence the shape ought to be determined by fits to experimental data ; they can be thought of as parametrizing a `` background polynomial , '' beyond the dominant pole terms , albeit with completely correct rescattering corrections , obeying watson s theorem",
    ". the necessary theoretical normalization of the form factors is essentially provided at @xmath283 , via eq .  ; its stability under higher - order corrections still merits further investigation in order to provide a theoretical uncertainty for @xmath0 extracted from @xmath11 decays .    to summarize",
    ", we have provided a description of the form factors for the decay @xmath10 using dispersion theory , which should lead to an improved method to measure @xmath0 .",
    "pion final - state interactions have been included nonperturbatively in the elastic approximation , while left - hand - cut structures in the @xmath82 interaction are approximated by @xmath83 pole terms .",

    "improved experimental data to allow for such an analysis to be performed in practice is therefore highly desirable .",
    "as an outlook concerning theoretical improvement , we have hinted at the possibility to extend the present analysis to lower values of the dilepton invariant mass @xmath46 , beyond the range of applicability of heavy - meson chiral perturbation theory , but still making use of dispersion relation for the dependence on the dipion invariant mass @xmath45 . one promising constraint could be obtained from soft - pion theorems  @xcite , which relate linear combinations of @xmath11 form factors at @xmath286 , but arbitrary @xmath46 , to @xmath287 ( @xmath288 ) form factors at same @xmath46 .",
    "given reliable phenomenological information on the form factors for @xmath288 , this may provide precisely ( part of ) the matching information needed to extend the dispersive method of this paper to lower values of @xmath46 .",
