    "equilibrium phase transitions are determined as non - analyticities of the free energy and can strictly appear only in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite . at finite temperatures ,",
    "phase transitions are driven by thermal noise and states of systems are minima of the free energy , namely systems tend to show large entropy for higher temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum phase transitions are driven by quantum fluctuations and appear at absolute zero temperature @xcite . while the entropy contribution to the free energy in equilibrium systems prohibits the equilibrium phase transition in one - dimensional systems with short range interactions @xcite , a nonequilibrium phase transition in one dimension is possible .",
    "nonequilibrium phase transitions are usually considered as qualitative changes of the steady state . in",
    "classical case nonequilibrium phase transitions are well studied and appear e.g. in driven diffusive models  @xcite .",
    "the yang - lee description of equilibrium phase transition in terms of zeros of the partition function  @xcite , has been applied to classical nonequilibrium setting  @xcite .    on the other hand , nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions ( nqpt )",
    "are much less known . in that respect some interesting numerical results  @xcite show a nqpt in one - dimensional boundary driven nonequilibrium spin systems .",
    "moreover , approaches to deal with the nonequilibrium quantum systems usually involve different approximations , and their validity near a nqpt has not been carefully discussed .",
    "thus , it is important to analyze the differences between several approaches to nonequilibrium quantum systems in a simple pedagogic model undergoing a nqpt .",
    "nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) of quantum systems are mainly studied using two approaches .    * in one approach , we decompose the total , composite system into a finite system and reservoir parts and derive , by tracing out the latter , an effective master equation for the density operator of the former , i.e. we obtain an effective master equation for the reduced density operator of the finite system .",
    "it is possible to derive an exact master equation for the reduced density operator of the system , which however , is usually as difficult as to solve the original problem .",
    "therefore , various approximation schemes have been developed to suitably describe different regimes . in the simplest case ,",
    "we obtain a markovian completely - positive master equation , namely the lindblad master equation  @xcite , and the ness is obtained as a projection of the initial density operator onto the null - space of the generator of the dynamics , the liouvillian @xmath6 .",
    "markovian master equations have mostly been used in quantum optics  @xcite , quantum information , and quantum computation as a simple model of noisy channels .",
    "however , recently they have also been applied in condensed matter context to study high temperature transport properties of simple one - dimensional systems   @xcite and to discuss special nonequilibrium states of matter  @xcite . in this paper , we shall employ two models , which have been developed to study transport of open quantum systems , namely the modified redfield master equation approach  @xcite and the mesoreservoir approach  @xcite . *",
    "the other is the @xmath0 algebra approach , which was first introduced with the purpose to rigorously formulate equilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "it has been applied to infinitely extended systems  @xcite .",
    "starting from ruelle s work  @xcite on scattering - theoretical characterizations of ness , the @xmath0 algebra method has been extensively developed ( see for instance , references of  @xcite ) and applied also in the context of phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the reduced density operator method , the @xmath0 algebra deals with infinite systems which evolve unitarily .",
    "it was shown that if a system is connected to two separated subsystems initially in thermal states , finite part of the total system approaches to a unique ness under some mathematical conditions  @xcite . in that case",
    "the constructed ness does not depend on the initial decomposition , i.e. the size of the central ( finite ) system , and initial density operator of the central system .",
    "although the @xmath0 algebra provides mathematically rigorous results , the applications are quite limited .",
    "accordingly , it is beneficial to use the @xmath0 algebra approach to test other approaches for their validity .    in this paper",
    "we use the @xmath0 algebra approach , the lindblad formalism with mesoreservoirs , and the modified redfield master equation to study the xy spin @xmath7 chain  a paradigmatic model exhibiting quantum phase transitions ( qpt )  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the transverse - field xy spin 1/2 chain is @xmath8 where @xmath3 denotes the anisotropy , @xmath4 denotes the magnetic field , and @xmath9 are the pauli spin operators at @xmath10-th site . to begin with ,",
    "let us summarize phase transitions of the xy spin @xmath7 chain discussed previously . at @xmath5 ,",
    "there is a second order qpt characterized by the order parameter @xmath11 ( @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 ) , which separates the ferromagnetic ordered phase ( @xmath16 ) and the paramagnetic disordered phase ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "equilibrium average of @xmath18 for @xmath19 is always zero , and it can not be used as an order parameter .",
    "magnetization in the @xmath20 direction is always finite , but susceptibility is divergent at absolute zero temperature and @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , at @xmath21 and @xmath22 there is a quantum phase transition between the ordered phase in the @xmath23 direction ( @xmath13 ) and the @xmath24 direction ( @xmath15 ) . in case of the open xy spin 1/2 chain coupled to local lindblad reservoirs @xcite and redfield reservoirs @xcite , indications of a nqpt",
    "were reported .",
    "numerically , it was observed that @xmath25 is a critical magnetic field which separates phases showing different scaling of the quantum mutual information ( qmi ) , spectral gap , and far - from - diagonal spin - spin correlations @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this transition was recently described by an information - geometric approach using a fidelity distance measure @xcite .",
    "we shall complement the so far obtained phase diagram of the xy chain by using the @xmath0 algebra method .",
    "we shall focus on the nqpt and reveal new quantum phase transitions , which do not exist in equilibrium .",
    "we shall show the existence of a nqpt at @xmath5 for arbitrary temperatures of reservoirs , which is associated to a discontinuity of the third derivative of the off - diagonal elements of the correlation matrix .",
    "we also demonstrate a discontinuity of the first derivative of the correlation matrix elements at @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , we show that qpt at @xmath5 persists in the nonequilibrium case if temperature of at least one reservoir is set to be zero .",
    "a phase diagram showing equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions of the xy spin 1/2 chain is presented in .",
    "we shall compare nqpts obtained using the @xmath0 algebra method with those obtained by simulations of the reduced density operator approaches , namely the mesoreservoir method @xcite and the modified redfield master equation @xcite .",
    "we shall also discuss the thermalization properties of the mesoreservoir approach .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we apply the @xmath0 algebra approach and show analytically the four different nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions of the xy model . in section 3",
    "we discuss the master equation approaches .",
    "first , in subsection 3.1 , we present the results of the lindblad mesoreservoir approach and discuss its equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties .",
    "second , in subsection 3.2 , we study the modified redfield model .",
    "we discuss the results and conclude in section 4 .",
    "in this section we study the nqpts of the xy spin 1/2 chain using the results of the @xmath0 algebra approach . we shall show the coexistence of two nqpts at @xmath5 and @xmath29 ( the critical xy line ) and a nqpt at the critical magnetic field @xmath30 .",
    "we also discuss the phase transition at the critical point @xmath21 and @xmath5 .",
    "these results are contrasted with two reduced density operator approaches , which will be discussed in .",
    "the xy spin 1/2 model has been extensively studied with the aid of the @xmath0 algebra , however the nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions have not been discussed so far .",
    "we briefly explain the terminology of the @xmath0 algebra method in the [ app2 ] . in @xcite",
    "the ness of the model was rigorously constructed using the scattering theory proposed by ruelle @xcite .",
    "long range correlation @xcite and non - negativity of entropy production  @xcite have been discussed for this ness .",
    "those works are highly mathematically oriented . in contrast , we provide a simpler and direct calculation , and focus on the nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "we start with an infinite chain , which is separated into the left semi - infinite part ( @xmath31 ) , the central finite part ( @xmath32 ) , and the right semi - infinite part ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the infinite chain is initially in the product states @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an arbitrary state and @xmath36 is the density operator of the canonical ensembles with temperature @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "one can prove that a unique ness of the chain exists and that the diagonal modes with positive ( negative ) velocities are distributed according to the canonical ensemble of the left ( right ) reservoir , and satisfy the wick s theorem , which is explicitly expressed as eqs .   and .",
    "let us first diagonalize the xy spin 1/2 model . with the aid of the araki - jordan - wigner transformation ( see the [ app2 ] ) ,",
    "the hamiltonian is mapped to a chain with fermions @xmath39 where @xmath40 satisfies canonical anti - commutation relations : @xmath41 next we apply the fourier transformation @xmath42 and rewrite the hamiltonian in the momentum basis as @xmath43 the hamiltonian can easily be diagonalized @xmath44 where eigenmode annihilation operators @xmath45 and the energy @xmath46 are defined by @xmath47 the ness of this model uniquely exists and is fully characterized by @xcite @xmath48 and the wick s theorem  @xcite , where @xmath49 represents a ness average , @xmath50 are fermi distributions with temperatures @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a step function , and @xmath53 is a velocity @xmath54 . to be more precise ,",
    "modes with positive and negative velocity follow different kms conditions ( see eq .",
    "( 27 ) of @xcite for the xy chain .",
    "see also eq .",
    "( 54 ) in @xcite for xx chain , where a more explicit expression in terms of the femi distribution is provided in eq .",
    "( 65 ) . ) .",
    "let us briefly discuss the intuitive idea behind equations and , which is implemented rigorously with the @xmath0 algebra approach .",
    "for that sake note that in the diagonal form the hamiltonian can be interpreted as a sum of hamiltonians @xmath55 and @xmath56 of two noninteracting systems where @xmath57 and @xmath58 . consider a free system such as one described by @xmath59 .",
    "at @xmath60 it is split into three parts : a left semi - infinite chain , a central finite chain , and a right semi - infinite chain .",
    "the left ( right ) semi - infinite chain is in a thermal state with temperature @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) . at @xmath63",
    "the three pieces are connected and the particles ( or quantum waves described by the diagonal modes ) that where confined to the left can now propagate to the right without any scattering and the same holds for the particles at the right . in that way , every right going mode in the system ( @xmath64 ) comes from the left and is populated accordingly with @xmath65 and every left going mode in the systems ( @xmath66 ) comes from the right and is populated by @xmath67 .",
    "this is the content of the equation .",
    "the equation is the same but for the system described by @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69 and the energies and velocities replaced according to @xmath70    using , and changing variables back to the @xmath40 , we compute the two point correlation functions in the ness @xmath71 from above equations , it is clear that the real parts of nonequilibrium correlations @xmath72 and @xmath73 are simply the averages of equilibrium correlations at the temperatures of left and right reservoirs . on the other hand , the imaginary parts of @xmath72 are zero , whereas the imaginary parts of @xmath74 are non - zero only in nonequilibrium and hence possess purely nonequilibrium features of the steady state , e.g. the information about the heat current .",
    "let us first discuss the magnetization , that is known to have a second order quantum phase transition ( for instance see proof of theorem  2.3 . in @xcite ) @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the susceptibility in ness .",
    "we shall now show that this transition persists also in the nonequilibrium setting where one of the reservoirs is initiated at finite non - zero temperature .    from equation",
    ", one can see that the magnetization  @xmath77 does not depend on the spatial variable  @xmath10 , and both the magnetization and susceptibility are simply the average of those in equilibrium .",
    "due to @xmath78 , the susceptibility diverges if and only if at least one of the reservoirs has absolute zero temperature .",
    "the divergence with respect to temperature  @xmath51 and the difference of magnetic field from one @xmath79 is logarithmic .",
    "therefore , at @xmath5 we have a quantum phase transition and a nqpt associated with the divergence of the susceptibility .",
    "the mechanism of the nqpt associated to the logarithmic divergence of the magnetic susceptibility is the same as in the equilibrium case since the ness average of the magnetization is a sum of terms coming from left and right reservoirs in equilibrium .",
    "since all real parts of the correlation matrix have this property , a genuine nqpt should be discussed through @xmath80 , which vanishes for equilibrium state ( the kernel is proportional to the difference of fermi distributions calculated with the initial temperatures of the left and right semi - infinite parts . ) .",
    "the first derivative of @xmath81 reads @xmath82 the presence of the step function @xmath83 in produces a discontinuity at @xmath28 .",
    "physically it can be explained by a change of the direction ( sign of velocity ) of the diagonal modes @xmath45 as a function of the magnetic field @xmath4 . in the equilibrium case ,",
    "diagonal modes @xmath45 follow the same fermi distribution independent of the direction ( velocity ) of the modes . on the other hand , in ness , diagonal modes",
    "@xmath45 with positive and negative velocities follow different fermi distributions . therefore ,",
    "changing the direction of the modes alter their nature only in nonequilibrium and this is the origin of the nqpt at @xmath84 , which is consequently a genuine nonequilibrium phenomenon .",
    "interestingly , there is also a discontinuity in the third derivative at @xmath5 .",
    "the third derivative for @xmath85 reads @xmath86 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : third_derivative ] ) , one can evaluate the jump of the third derivative at @xmath5 : @xmath87 since this transition is not related to the change of the direction of the modes , its origin is different from the transition discussed for @xmath28 .",
    "the behavior of derivatives and is depicted in .",
    "it is interesting that the non - continuities of the derivatives are present also in case of nonzero temperatures of the initial states of the reservoirs @xmath88 , while the transition of a real part such as magnetization is possible iff at least one of the reservoirs is set to absolute zero temperature .",
    "thus , behavior of the imaginary part is quite different from the real part , which is also the reason we believe @xmath89 determine genuine nonequilibrium properties .",
    "we recall that imaginary parts are related to currents of conserved quantities , e.g. the energy current and the spin current ( the latter is well - defined only in the isotropic case ) . at @xmath21 and @xmath90",
    "we find a square root divergence of magnetic susceptibility with the temperature @xmath37 and the difference of magnetic field from one @xmath79 , namely @xmath91 . in this case",
    "@xmath92 , the finite temperature nonequilibrium transitions associated to discontinuities in the derivatives of the imaginary parts of the correlation functions disappear .",
    "equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase diagram of the xy spin 1/2 model is depicted in .",
    "finally , we discuss scaling of the quantum mutual information ( qmi ) in the ness of the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "the scaling of qmi has been recently discussed in the context of area laws . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that gaussian thermal states obey the area law for qmi .",
    "on the other hand , the steady states may violate the area law despite being gaussian .",
    "in fact qmi was used to characterize the nqpt at @xmath28 in the xy model with redfield reservoirs @xcite ( see ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that below the critical field ( @xmath93 ) qmi obeys the area law , whereas above the critical field the qmi scales linearly with the system size .",
    "we calculate the scaling of the qmi in the ness by numerically diagonalizing the two - point majorana correlation matrix of the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "the von neumann entropy of the block of size @xmath94 can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath95 of the @xmath96 two - point majorana correlation matrix ( defined in ) as @xcite @xmath97 the quantum mutual information of the block of size @xmath98 is then given by @xmath99 .",
    "in we show that the qmi scales logarithmically with the block size @xmath94 .",
    "interestingly this scaling does not depend on the system parameters and therefore does not capture the nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "a related analytical calculation of the area law violation in the @xmath0 algebra ness was recently reported in the free fermion case @xcite , which is equivalent to the isotropic limit of the xy spin 1/2 chain .",
    "in this section we compare obtained exact @xmath0 algebra results with two models of open quantum systems , namely the lindblad mesoreservoir and the modified redfield master equation . in both cases",
    "dynamics of the system is determined by a liouville equation @xmath100 + { { \\hat{\\mathcal{d}}}}\\rho,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 $ ] denotes the commutator .",
    "although exact forms of the hamiltonian @xmath102 and the dissipator @xmath103 depend on details of the model , in the studied cases the hamiltonian is quadratic @xmath104 and the lindblad ( coupling ) operators are linear in terms of majorana fermions : @xmath105 therefore , as has been shown in @xcite , ness is a gaussian state and is fully characterized by the @xmath106 majorana correlation matrix @xmath107 of which time evolution is determined by @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 denote real and imaginary parts of the reservoir matrix @xmath111 , which represents influence of the environment and depends on the details of the dissipator for the mesoreservoir case is given in [ app1 ] and for the modified redfield case along with the derivation in @xcite . ] .",
    "time derivative of the correlation matrix is zero in ness , hence the steady state correlation matrix @xmath112 is obtained as a solution of a lyapunov equation @xmath113 the existence of ness guarantees that the equation ( [ eq : lyap ] ) has a solution , which can be computed efficiently in @xmath114 steps .",
    "recently , a model to describe ness of the systems including finite reservoirs degrees of freedom was introduced @xcite .",
    "the idea is not to trace out all degrees of freedom of the reservoirs but rather keep some representative parts ( mesoreservoirs ) , which are physically interpreted as the contacts of the system with the reservoirs .",
    "the time evolution of the total system ( mesoreservoirs and the system of interest ) is modeled with the lindblad master equation such that the mesoreservoirs are thermalized if the couplings between the system and mesoreservoirs are zero . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in the limit of weak coupling and large mesoreservoir size the system is thermalized if two mesoreservoirs with same thermodynamic variables are attached , while the particle current follows the landauer formula if two reservoirs with different thermodynamic variables are attached .",
    "therefore , one can argue that the mesoreservoir approach gives a meaningful description of a thermal reservoir . in the previous work , particle conserved hamiltonian attached to a linear",
    "dispersion mesoreservoirs are discussed .",
    "although the linear dispersion mesoreservoir gives the same liouvillian spectrum ( see [ app1 ] ) , their thermalization properties can be different .    to mimic the @xmath0 algebra setup discussed in the previous section , we treat parts of a chain as mesoreservoirs .",
    "the total hamiltonian consists of one dimensional xy spin 1/2 chain with a system size @xmath115 : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is given in ( [ eq : xy ] ) .",
    "we interpret parts of the system  @xmath118 $ ] and @xmath119 $ ] as mesoreservoirs , and the remaining part  @xmath120 $ ] as a central system .",
    "mesoreservoir parts ( @xmath121 ) are thermalized using the lindblad dissipator @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are diagonal modes of @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath127 and @xmath128 can be interpreted as couplings between mesoreservoirs and the traced - out degrees of freedom ( super - reservoir ) . in the subsection  [ sec : meso1 ]",
    "we first study the equilibrium properties of the model .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the divergence of magnetic susceptibility @xmath129 at @xmath5 .",
    "then , in the subsection  [ sec : meso2 ] , we turn to the nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions obtained by the @xmath0 algebra .",
    " in this subsection we first study magnetization and the corresponding susceptibility in the equilibrium state by the lindblad mesoreservoir approach .",
    "we observe a highly fluctuating magnetization profile for @xmath130 , and a flat magnetization profile except at the boundaries between system and mesoreservoirs for @xmath85 .",
    "typical magnetization profiles for different @xmath131 are shown in ( red dashed lines indicate the @xmath0 algebra results ) .",
    "the fluctuations present for magnetic field  @xmath132 are suppressed by decreasing dissipator strength @xmath131 . moreover ,",
    "the spin profiles approach the @xmath0 results ( red ) by decreasing @xmath131 ( see ) .    because of the fluctuations with respect to a space variable @xmath10 , we define magnetization and susceptibility using a space average of @xmath133 .",
    "one can see in _ left _ that the magnetization is roughly reproduced . however , there are small fluctuations for @xmath130 .",
    "this fluctuations are clearly observed in the susceptibility shown in _",
    "right_. in particular , one can see a big jump in susceptibility at the critical point  @xmath84 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath85 , the lindblad approach agrees very well with the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "in ( a ) we show the numerically calculated correlations @xmath134 in the mesoreservoir approach and compare them with the exact analytic @xmath0 results .",
    "near - diagonal correlations at low temperatures ( @xmath135 ) calculated with the mesoreservoir approach agree with the @xmath0 results . on the other hand , long - range correlations saturate as a function of @xmath136 ( for finite @xmath131 and @xmath137 ) to a plateau in the mesoreservoir approach , while they decay exponentially fast in the @xmath0 algebra method . as expected , the agreement between the @xmath0 and mesoreservoir correlations is improved for smaller coupling to the super - reservoir @xmath131 and larger mesoreservoir size @xmath137 ( see ( b ) ) . if the temperature is high enough @xmath138 the mesoreservoirs fail to thermalize the central system , as can be seen from  ( c),(d ) , where we show the @xmath131 dependence of @xmath139 for low and high temperatures at different values of the magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "the mesoreservoir results match with the @xmath0 algebra for low temperatures , but are notably different for high temperatures .",
    "fortunately in the regime where we want to observe the qpt , the @xmath0 algebra and the lindblad mesoreservoir approach agree well .",
    "nevertheless , the thermalization at @xmath5 is very subtle since the susceptibility diverges logarithmically . to discuss the divergence at @xmath5 one",
    "should take a limit @xmath140 and @xmath141 , as can be seen from figure  [ kdependence ] , where we show the mesoreservoir size  @xmath137 dependence of the susceptibilities with several coupling strengths @xmath131 at @xmath142 .",
    "we see that the divergence of susceptibility for @xmath143 is reconstructed with the lindblad mesoreservoir approach in the limit of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the divergence is logarithmic with respect to @xmath137 and @xmath37 .",
    "imaginary parts of correlation matrix are vanishing linearly with respect to @xmath131 , while specific observables such as heat current vanish for arbitrary @xmath131 .",
    " in this subsection , we shall discuss the ness of mesoreservoir approach .",
    "we numerically observe that the real part of the correlation matrix is an average of equilibrium correlation matrices . following the discussion of the previous subsection",
    ", the divergence of susceptibility is concluded in the mesoreservoir approach . because of this property , we focus on the imaginary part of the correlation matrix , which represents a genuine nonequilibrium property .",
    "let us first discuss the two extreme cases ( @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) .",
    "for very small @xmath131 the total system ( system @xmath146 reservoirs ) is decoupled from super reservoirs , and the system is expected to follow an average of fermi distributions @xmath147 .",
    "thus , @xmath148 and @xmath149 approach to zero for @xmath144 . on the other hand ,",
    "taking large @xmath131 enforces the mesoreservoirs to follow exactly the fermi distributions , as a result , @xmath148 and @xmath149 are very small for @xmath145 ( having non - zero off - diagonal element is related to the deviations of reservoirs particle occupations from the fermi distributions  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , one should carefully choose coupling  @xmath131 to deal with the imaginary parts of nonequilibrium case , and in fact , @xmath131 should be in the order of @xmath150 to describe coherent transport in ness , where @xmath151 is the width of the mesoreservoirs energy band . in ( a ) and ( b )",
    "show comparisons between the ness correlations of the @xmath0 algebra and the mesoreservoir at different magnetic fields  ( a ) and different dissipation strengths  @xmath131 .",
    "we observe that the correlations of the @xmath0 algebra and the mesoreservoir in ness quickly differ with the distance from the diagonal elements . despite the excellent agreement for nearly diagonal elements",
    ", we were unable to obtain the jumps in derivatives of the correlation function .",
    "moreover , we have to choose the right ratio between the coupling strength @xmath131 and the mesoreservoir size @xmath137 as can be seen from ( c ) and ( d ) , where we show the off - diagonal correlations for different coupling strengths and a fixed mesoreservoir size @xmath152 .",
    "since the ratio between @xmath131 and @xmath137 is important for the nonequilibrium correlations , one sees the strong @xmath137 dependence on the correlations , contrasting the fact that real parts of the correlations do not drastically depend on the mesoreservoir size @xmath137 .",
    "for instance , real parts shown in are quite robust by changing @xmath137 ( thus , we show only @xmath153 ) , on the other hand , clearly shows that imaginary parts strongly depend on @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , as discussed in @xcite , the @xmath131 dependence of @xmath148 shows a plateau for @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath137 .    in conclusion ,",
    "similar to the boundary driven lindblad model we observe also in the mesoreservoir approach signatures of the nqpt at @xmath84 , namely a change in the sensitivity of local observables to the system parameters .",
    "below the critical field @xmath28 we see large fluctuations , whereas above the critical field there are no fluctuations as we vary the model parameters ( see and ) .",
    "however , this fluctuations are suppressed as @xmath131 goes to zero . on the other hand , we were unable to observe the scaling of the qmi and the far - from - diagonal correlations due to limitation of the resources , since we should take the limit of large mesoreservoir size and small coupling to the super - reservoir .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior of the off - diagonal correlations shown in suggests that the mesoreservoir approach in the limit @xmath156 and @xmath157 resembles the behavior of the @xmath0 algebra , i.e. power law decay of the ness correlations and the logarithmic divergence of the qmi in all regimes .",
    "we also recover the @xmath0 algebra divergence of the magnetic susceptibility at zero temperature and @xmath5 in equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations .",
    "other genuine nonequilibrium transitions observed with the @xmath0 algebra could not be recovered in the mesoreservoir approach .",
    "the modified redfield master equation was studied in @xcite as a model of thermal reservoirs .",
    "the main difference to the lindblad reservoirs is the non - local property of the redfield dissipator which , when extending the integrals in the correlation function from minus infinity to infinity , ensures that the gibbs state is the steady state if all reservoirs have the same temperature . after using this additional assumption",
    ", the redfield dissipator takes the form @xmath158 + h.c .",
    ", \\label{eq : redfd}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 is the reservoir correlation function , @xmath160 are the coupling operators , and the tilde @xmath161 denotes the interaction picture .",
    "the reservoir correlation function @xmath162 satisfies the kms condition @xmath163 we follow @xcite and couple the xy spin 1/2 chain to two boundary thermal reservoirs with the coupling operators @xmath164 the left and right reservoirs are uncorrelated @xmath165 and have ohmic reservoir spectral functions @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath168 .",
    "this choice of correlation functions and coupling operators represents standard reservoirs of harmonic oscillators at two ends with possibly different temperatures .",

    "we studied nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions in the xy spin 1/2 chain analytically using the @xmath0 algebra method .",
    "first , we showed that the qpt at @xmath5 is present also in nonequilibrium if one temperature of the reservoirs remains at absolute zero .",
    "in other words , qpt persists even with strong thermal noise coming from one of the reservoirs if the other reservoir is at absolute zero temperature . at the critical point @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath5 the logarithmic divergence of susceptibility becomes algebraic .",
    "second , we discovered two new transitions which do not exist in equilibrium state . to be concrete , we found discontinuities of the first derivative ( at @xmath28 , @xmath180 ) and the third derivative ( at @xmath5 , @xmath180 ) of the imaginary part of the correlation matrix . the former transition appear because a part of normal modes changes its sign of velocity when the magnetic field is smaller than @xmath181 , and thus those modes change the information of the reservoirs they carry . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical interpretation of the later transition is still unclear .",
    "moreover , at the critical point @xmath21 and @xmath5 the jumps in the derivatives disappear .",
    "we use these transitions to test the utility of two time generators commonly used in theories of the reduced density operator , namely lindblad and redfield master equations .",
    "*   _ comparison with the lindblad mesoreservoir approach _  we show that the lindblad mesoreservoir quantitatively reproduces the qpt in equilibrium .",
    "however , we observed that off - diagonal elements which have small expectation values disagree even in equilibrium case . for nonequilibrium state",
    ", we numerically observe that the real part of correlation is an average of equilibrium values , which agrees with the @xmath0 algebra , and does not agree with the modified redfield equation .",
    "+ for the correlation matrix , we found that the lindblad mesoreservoir and the @xmath0 algebra agree only for correlations near diagonal elements , and are more accurate for small magnetic fields and low temperatures . despite the good agreement for nearly - diagonal elements ,",
    "we were not able to recover nonequilibrium phase transitions except the divergence of the susceptibility at @xmath5 , which seems to be induced by the same mechanism as in equilibrium case .",
    "this may be the effect of finite mesoreservoir size @xmath137 and coupling strength to environment @xmath131 . * _ comparison with the modified redfield master equation _ ",
    "the modified redfield equation by construction exactly describes equilibrium states , which is described by the @xmath0 algebra in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "nevertheless , it does not reproduce any nonequilibrium phase transitions observed by the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "moreover , we find that the imaginary part of the correlation matrix strongly depend on the dissipation strength  @xmath131 .    for the reduced density operator methods ( redfield and lindblad ) , the hypersensitivities to the model parameters below @xmath181",
    "are reported . in the mesoreservoir case",
    "the fluctuations are suppressed if small dissipator strength  @xmath131 and large mesoreservoir size @xmath137 are taken .",
    "thus , a drastic change of system s properties at @xmath84 is a common feature of the @xmath0 algebra and the reduced density operator methods , but they are quite different . in the previous works ,",
    "the transition obtained by reduced density operator was characterized by the appearance of the correlation resonances @xcite and different scaling of the qmi in the long and short range correlation regimes . on the contrary",
    ", it was shown with the @xmath0 algebra that the scaling of the correlation elements with the distance from the diagonal remains unchanged as we cross the critical magnetic field @xmath181 , i.e. , exponential decay of correlations in the equilibrium and power law decay of correlations in the nonequilibrium case .",
    "we also numerically showed that the qmi scales logarithmically with the system size @xmath94 in all regimes .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the transition obtained by the reduced density operator  @xcite is a consequence of the approach itself .    since none of the discussed reduced density operator approaches can describe all transitions obtained by the exact calculations ( @xmath0 algebra ) , the question `` can any reduced density operator methods thermalize the xy spin 1/2 chain in the complete range of parameters , and at the same time reproduce the nonequilibrium phase transitions obtained by the @xmath0 algebra ? ''",
    "remains open .",
    "further another interesting question arises , namely `` what kind of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions we obtain by using different approaches ? '' . in other words , to what extend the nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions and the nonequilibrium properties of systems in general depend on the reservoirs ( models of open system evolution ) .",
