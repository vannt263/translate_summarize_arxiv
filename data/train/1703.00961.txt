    "magnetic @xmath0 vortices have been of great interest both theoretically and experimentally since they were first predicted by abrikosov  @xcite in ginzburg - landau theory  @xcite back in the fifties . since then",
    "they have been studied extensively not only in the context of non - relativistic condensed matter systems  @xcite but also in particle physics  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that a mathematical isomorphism between ginzburg - landau theory and the abelian higgs model was formally established  @xcite in the seventies .",
    "more recently , there has been increasing interest in the properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the presence of large magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "this interest stems from the presence of large magnetic fields in a variety of physical systems including magnetars  @xcite and in quark gluon plasma  @xcite at rhic .",
    "additionally , there has also been increasing interest in systems of mesons in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "it was shown that @xmath1-mesons may condense in the qcd vacuum at extremely large magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the resulting condensed system consists of charged @xmath2 mesons and a neutral @xmath3 meson and in the presence of magnetic field they can form a ground state consisting of a magnetic vortex lattice , in which not only the charged @xmath1-mesons condense but also the neutral meson superfluid condenses . on the other hand , there are systems such as low - energy qcd described by chiral perturbation theory , which at finite isospin and in the presence of external magnetic fields behaves like a type - ii superconductor .",
    "chiral perturbation theory has three mesons , namely the charged pions @xmath4 and the neutral pion , @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the magnetic vortices that form at moderate external fields only the charged pions ( @xmath4 ) condense in the vortex state and the neutral pions are absent in the vortices  @xcite .",
    "this is also true in the context of the linear sigma model  @xcite .",
    "the physics encoded within chiral perturbation theory is constrained by the symmetries and symmetry breaking properties of qcd . in this paper",
    ", we consider a less restrictive model : an extension of the abelian higgs model consisting of charged scalars coupled to a charge - less scalar via a quartic coupling and investigate vortex solutions within this model .",
    "in particular we are interested in studying the possibility of neutral scalar condensation .",
    "of course there is the trivial scenario , where the real scalar field has a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and as condenses in a vortex .",
    "but a slightly more non - trivial scenario is when the real scalar field has a zero vacuum expectation value , yet condenses in the vortex phase .",
    "the advantage of using such a model is that there are parameters such as the scalar masses and strength of the interaction between the scalars that can be controlled less restrictively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we construct the  extended abelian higgs model \" and find the homogeneous ground state of the theory . in section 3",
    ", we consider the behavior of the vortex asymptotically far away from the vortex center . in section 4",
    ", we show the full numerical vortex solutions for a wide range of parameters and interactions between the charged and the neutral scalars .",
    "finally , we construct a  phase diagram \" showing the region in parameter space , where neutral pion condenses while having a zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "we begin by constructing the lagrangian for an extended version of the standard abelian higgs model that not only contains a set of charged scalars ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) but also a real scalar field ( @xmath8 ) that couples to the complex scalar field via an interaction term of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the strength of the coupling between the real and complex scalar fields .",
    "note that the two fields can not couple via electromagnetic interactions since the real scalar is electromagnetically neutral .",
    "therefore , the fields must couple via strong interactions - it is worth pointing out that in chiral perturbation , the two charged pions ( @xmath4 ) and the neutral pion ( @xmath5 ) interact with each other through both momentum - dependent and momentum - independent interactions  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the extended abelian higgs model is then : @xmath11 where @xmath12 in the lagrangian , @xmath13 is the electromagnetic tensor with @xmath14 representing the spatial components of the vector potential .",
    "@xmath6 is a complex scalar field and @xmath8 is a real scalar field , which is electromagnetically neutral .",
    "@xmath15 is the charge associated with the complex scalar fields .",
    "finally , note that the lagrangian is invariant under local u(1 ) gauge transformations , i.e. @xmath16 and under @xmath17 and @xmath18 .      in this section ,",
    "we find the ground state of the model in the absence of a photon field , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "the ground state must be homogeneous , therefore we begin by minimizing the potential . in order to do so",
    ", we introduce the notation : @xmath20 and minimize the potential with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we get @xmath23 the extremum of the potential then occurs when @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the magnitude squared of the fields @xmath6 and @xmath8 ( respectively ) at the extremum of the potential @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "the extremum is a locally stable minimum if the following conditions are satisfied ( according to the second derivative test ) : @xmath28 and @xmath29 which automatically implies that @xmath30 since @xmath31 is positive definite .",
    "since by definition , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the local minimum stability condition requires that the discriminant , @xmath34 , it follows that the model possesses the following vacuum expectation values in their ground states .",
    "the vevs of @xmath6 and @xmath8 are denoted by @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively : +   + 1 .",
    "normal vacuum : + @xmath37 + 2 .",
    "charged superfluid : + @xmath38 + 3 .",
    "neutral superfluid : + @xmath39 + 4 . charged and",
    "neutral superfluids + @xmath40 + note that the vacuum expectation values in the normal and charged superfluid state are consistent with the abelian higgs model  @xcite as expected .",
    "also , local stability requires @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( and consequently @xmath43 ) .",
    "in this section , we consider single vortex solutions within the extended abelian higgs model .",
    "we assume time - independence , i.e. @xmath44 and that the zeroth component of the vector potential , @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , we will only concern ourselves with magnetic fields in this paper and ignore electric fields .",
    "it is important to note that when considering the thermodynamics one has to be careful not to ignore the energy density associated with the electromagnetic charge densities that condense in the charged superfluid state .",
    "it can be ignored as long as the electromagnetic energy density associated with the charged superfluids is small compared to the strength of the remaining interactions , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a full discussion in the context of chiral perturbation theory . in this paper",
    ", we will only consider single vortex solutions and leave the thermodynamic discussion to future work .",
    "vortices are known to be the ground state in the presence of  moderate \" external magnetic fields in ginzburg landau theory  @xcite ( and therefore the abelian higgs model  @xcite ) .",
    "vortex solutions are cylindrically symmetric and obey the following ansatz : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the polar angle and @xmath48 is an integer .",
    "note that only the radial and longitudinal components of the vector potential are zero and the polar component only depends on the radial distance from the center of the vortex .",
    "the polar dependence of the the charged scalar field is what gives rise to the vortex quantization condition .",
    "the electromagnetic current is as follows : @xmath49 ( note that it is proportional to the electromagnetic charge of the complex scalar as expected . )",
    "using the vortex ansatz , it is straightforward to show that the radial and longitudinal components of the current are both zero .",
    "@xmath50 @xmath51 the polar component of the electromagnetic current is non - zero but must vanish at infinity ( i.e. @xmath52 ) giving the magnetic flux quantization condition , which is identical to the abelian higgs model since the new scalar field is charge - less and hence does not contribute to the electromagnetic current  @xcite .",
    "@xmath53 where the line integral in the first term is performed at infinity .",
    "asymptotically , the polar component of the vector potential has the following form : @xmath54 which is consistent with the flux quantization condition of eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) .      in order to analyze the vortex asymptotics ,",
    "we begin with the equations of motion @xmath55 which can be simplified in cylindrical coordinates using the vortex ansatz : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 while the equations above can not be solved exactly , it is possible to deduce the behavior close to the center of the vortex ( @xmath59 ) : @xmath60 and also asymptotically far away from the vortex : @xmath61 furthermore , it is possible to find how the photon and scalar fields approach their asymptotically values .",
    "we begin with @xmath62 written in the following form : @xmath63 assuming @xmath64 , the equation of motion for @xmath62 can be solved to get : @xmath65 where the @xmath66 s are arbitrary constants and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are modified bessel functions of the second and first kinds .",
    "we can set @xmath69 noting that the bessel function of the second kind , @xmath68 , has the wrong asymptotic behavior ] ] .",
    "therefore , the polar component of the vector potential , @xmath62 , has the following asymptotic form : @xmath70 with @xmath71 with @xmath72 being an undetermined constant .",
    "next , we proceed to find the asymptotic forms of both the scalar fields , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in order to do so ,",
    "we first define : @xmath75 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the vevs in the ground state and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the fluctuations around the vevs",
    ". then equations of motion for @xmath78 and @xmath79 are as follows : @xmath80 where the @xmath81s are defined as : @xmath82 we can then rewrite the homogeneous coupled differential equation of eq .",
    "( [ coupled ] ) in the following form : @xmath83 the above matrix equation can be solved exactly ; in order to do so note that the matrix with @xmath81s in eq .",
    "( [ homogeneous ] ) has the following eigenvalues and eigenvectors @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the normalized eigenvectors with eigenvalues @xmath86 .",
    "then we define the matrix @xmath87 and the matrix @xmath88 such that @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath92 the coupled equations of eq .",
    "( [ homogeneous ] ) then decouple in the new basis : @xmath93 the solutions of the equations then are @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are different bessel functions of the second and first kinds respectively .",
    "as before , we set @xmath97 since @xmath96 has the wrong asymptotic properties , @xmath98 has the same behavior as @xmath99 at leading order . but @xmath100 is different from @xmath101 by a a complex conjugation , i.e. @xmath102 at leading order . ] .",
    "finally then we have solutions to the homogeneous coupled equation : @xmath103 the particular solutions of this equation have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , we simply quote the result here : @xmath104 with corrections of @xmath105 . plugging the ansatz into the coupled differential equation of eq .",
    "( [ coupled ] ) , we get for @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 : @xmath109 therefore , the full solution to the coupled equations of eq .",
    "( [ coupled ] ) is : @xmath110 where @xmath111 are the elements of the matrix @xmath112 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are undetermined constants .",
    "however , note that the solution quoted in eq .",
    "( [ fullsolution ] ) is not valid if the vev of @xmath8 is zero .",
    "the case with @xmath115 is discussed towards the end of the next section .",
    "in this section , we present the single vortex solutions ( with unit flux of @xmath116 ) generated numerically . before we proceed with a discussion of these solutions",
    ", we note that the mass of the scalars and the photon in the extended abelian higgs model are @xmath117 it is interesting to note that the mass scales that affect the asymptotic behavior of the charged and neutral scalar condensates are @xmath86 and @xmath118 . the mass scale that affects the asymptotic behavior of the vector potential is @xmath119 , not @xmath120 .    in our numerical vortex solutions ,",
