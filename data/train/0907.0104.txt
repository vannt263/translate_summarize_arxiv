    "up to the mid-70s , the study of the hlder regularity of the sample paths of stochastic processes was focused on two main issues : the determination of their uniform modulus of continuity , and the existence of an almost - everywhere pointwise modulus of continuity . however , the first indications that their pointwise regularity could vary from point to point in a subtle way , appeared in the works of orey - taylor @xcite and perkins @xcite , who showed that the fast and slow points of brownian motion are located on random fractal sets .",
    "furthermore , they determined the hausdorff dimensions of these sets . brownian motion , however , only displays very slight changes in its modulus of continuity ( which is modified only by logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with other types of processes , such as lvy processes for instance , whose modulus of continuity changes completely from point to point .",
    "let us recall the relevant definitions related with pointwise hlder regularity , in this context .",

    "the singularity spectrum of @xmath11 describes the geometric repartition of its hlder singularities , and encapsulates a geometric information which is usually more meaningful than the hlder exponent .",
    "following the way opened by frisch and parisi , the spectrum of singularities of large classes of stochastic processes ( or random measures , in which case an appropriate notion of hlder pointwise regularity for measures is used ) have been determined .",
    "most examples of stochastic processes @xmath11 which have been studied display the following remarkable features .    * though the iso - hlder sets are random , the spectrum of singularities is deterministic : for some deterministic function @xmath21 , a.s .",

    "though it is easy to construct artificial _ ad hoc _ processes that do not satisfy these properties , it is remarkable that many `` natural '' processes of very different kind follow this rule : lvy processes @xcite , lvy processes in multifractal time @xcite , fractional brownian motions , random self - similar measures and random gibbs measures @xcite , mandelbrot cascades @xcite , poisson cascades @xcite , among many other examples .",
    "see however @xcite where durand constructed a counterexample whose wavelet coefficients are defined using markov trees .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the regularity properties of some markov processes .",
    "our purpose at this stage is not to obtain results in the most general form , but rather to consider some specific examples , and check that such processes indeed display a random spectrum , which is not homogeneous .",
    "note that , until now , the only markov processes which have been analyzed from the multifractal standpoint are the lvy processes .",
    "we now introduce a new notion , the _ local spectrum _ , which is tailored to the study of functions with non - homogeneous spectra .",

    "the local spectrum of @xmath11 at @xmath9 is the function @xmath25    by monotonicity ( if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 ) , the limit exists and it is independent of the particular basis chosen .",
    "clearly , a function has a homogeneous spectrum if and only if for all @xmath14 , @xmath28 is independent of @xmath29 .",
    "the local spectrum allows one to recover the spectrum of all possible restrictions of @xmath11 on an open interval .",

    "this would of course imply that @xmath48 .",
    "let us now recall the multifractal nature of lvy processes without brownian component . in that case ,",
    "the spectrum of singularities only depends on one parameter , the _ lower index _ of blumenthal and getoor , which quantifies the `` density '' of small jumps , and is defined , for any non - negative measure @xmath49 on @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 , by @xmath52 note that the integrability condition implies that @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "the following result of @xcite yields the spectrum of singularities of such lvy processes .",

    "it is not stated explicitly in @xcite that the spectrum of a lvy process is homogeneous , but it is a direct consequence of the proof .",
    "indeed , the spectrum is computed on a arbitrary interval , and the stationarity of the increments implies that it does not depend on the particular location of this interval .",
    "although a lvy process is random , its spectrum is almost surely deterministic . as explained above",
    ", this is the situation usually met when performing the multifractal analysis of random processes or random measures possessing either stationarity or scaling invariance properties .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how these results are modified when the stationarity assumption is dropped",
    ". we will give examples of markov processes whose singularity spectra are non - homogeneous and random .",
    "a quite general class of one - dimensional markov processes consists of stochastic differential equations ( s.d.e . ) with jumps , see ethier - kurtz @xcite , ikeda - watanabe @xcite",
    ". since the brownian motion is mono - fractal , the brownian part of such a process will not be very relevant .",
    "thus in order to avoid technical difficulties , we consider a jumping s.d.e . without brownian and drift part , starting e.g. from @xmath58 , and with jump measure @xmath59 ( meaning that when located at @xmath60 , the process jumps to @xmath61 at rate @xmath59 ) .",
    "again to make the study as simple as possible , we will assume that the process has finite variations , and even that it is increasing ( that is , @xmath62 for all @xmath63 ) .",
    "classically , a necessary condition for the process to be well - defined is that @xmath64 .    if @xmath65 is chosen so that the index @xmath66 is constant with respect to @xmath60 , then we expect that @xmath67 will be deterministic and independent of @xmath8 .",
    "we thus impose that the index of the jump measure depends on the value @xmath60 of the process .",
    "the most natural example of such a situation consists in choosing @xmath68}(u)du,\\ ] ] for some function @xmath69 .",

    "this local comparison will be strengthened in section  [ tangent ] , where we prove the existence of tangent processes for @xmath83 ( which are lvy stable subordinators ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ mr1 ] requires a so - called _",

    "nonetheless , observe that the spectrum we obtain , when viewed as a map from @xmath92 to @xmath92 , is very irregular , and certainly multifractal itself .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the spectra usually obtained , which are most of the time concave or ( piecewise ) real - analytic .",
    "random processes with random singularity exponents of the most general form have already been constructed in @xcite , but there is no direct relationship with having a random singularity spectrum .",

    "in particular , this is certainly the case if we keep the same measures @xmath129 and if we drop the monotonicity assumption on the lipschitz - continuous function @xmath130 .",
