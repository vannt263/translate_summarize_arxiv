    "<S> we suggest that the higgs boson is a light composite state that does not emerge from tev scale strong dynamics for any generic reason , such as when it is pseudo - goldstone boson </S>",
    "<S> . instead , a state that is higgs - like and fairly decoupled from heavier states may simply be a reflection of very particular strong dynamics , with properties quite distinct from more familiar large-@xmath0 type gauge dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we elaborate on this picture in the context of a strongly interacting fourth family and an effective 4-higgs - doublet model . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of a decoupling limit and the corrections to it are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of the 126 gev mass higgs would appear to resolve the question of the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking , especially given the simplicity of the standard model description ( sm ) and the lack of any evidence of additional physics . </S>",
    "<S> but nagging issues of naturalness and the long list of parameters of the standard model suggest that we have not yet reached the end of the story . </S>",
    "<S> if the higgs description emerges as only an effective low energy description then it is with the ultraviolet completion that the story can continue .    </S>",
    "<S> but ultraviolet completions that maintain the local higgs description on scales at least an order of magnitude above the tev scale are now facing their own issues of naturalness as well as a general lack of simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> of course the reason to push the ultraviolet completions to higher scales is to avoid effects of the new physics that perhaps should already have been seen . </S>",
    "<S> but we view the exact nature of the new effects to be a model dependent question , so that the generic estimates of the effects may be substantially modified by the structure of a particular theory or by difficult to calculate effects of strong interactions . with this in mind </S>",
    "<S> we feel that it remains worthwhile to consider the possibility that the higgs description breaks down at no more than a few times the tev scale , since it is in this case that issues of naturalness are most simply resolved . </S>",
    "<S> it may appear that nature has conspired a little to keep this nearby physics hidden from us , but we wo nt know by how much unless we study these theories further .    from the viewpoint of simplicity and economy , </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of an ultraviolet completion at a tev is that the fundamental matter degrees of freedom can be standard chiral fermions . rather than exotically charged fermions , </S>",
    "<S> a sequential extension of the known fermions , a fourth family , can be considered . </S>",
    "<S> new fermions of a fourth family have masses that are bounded from above , @xmath1 tev , due to the fact that their masses would contribute to @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses . the direct search for the heavy quarks of a fourth family </S>",
    "<S> have not yet saturated this bound , but the current lower limits on their masses do put the nature of new interactions involving the fourth family firmly in the strongly interacting regime .    in the case of a strongly interacting fourth family </S>",
    "<S> it is the condensates of the heavy quarks , the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 , that are likely the primary origin of electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we shall find that it is also important to include the effects of the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 , and so we include all four fermions in the set of heavy fermions we consider . </S>",
    "<S> they all contribute to the loop induced @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 couplings of the light states of interest while the fourth neutrino @xmath10 does not and so we choose to neglect it . </S>",
    "<S> a neutrino condensate does contribute to electroweak symmetry breaking but the error we make by neglecting it should be small . </S>",
    "<S> in addition if this neutrino mass is of the majorana type then the mixing of the associated scalar mode with the other scalar modes should be suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> there are various contributions of both signs that the heavy fermions make to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 parameters , but a fourth family can not as yet be ruled out solely by these precision measurements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of the higgs - like 126 gev state presents some serious hurdles for any theory of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> there are basically three questions . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) how can the strongly interacting theory at a tev have a light scalar in its mass spectrum ? ( 2 ) why should this light scalar resemble a fluctuation around the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of an electroweak scalar doublet , as indicated by its observed couplings to @xmath2 and @xmath3 ? ( 3 ) how can it be that the couplings of the scalar to the heavy fermions are such that the induced loop couplings to @xmath8 and @xmath9 also resemble that of the higgs boson ?    </S>",
    "<S> we first comment on the second question . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the condensates that can develop for the four scalar electroweak doublets @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations around these condensates include the neutral and charged goldstone bosons . </S>",
    "<S> they may also include other rather light states , at least lighter than twice the heavy quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> the local fermion condensates are one manifestation of the symmetry breaking , but a better representation of the order parameters is provided by the momentum dependent dynamically generated fermion mass functions </S>",
    "<S> . then differing fluctuations around these mass functions will also be characterized by their differing momentum dependence , that is by their form factors in momentum space .    </S>",
    "<S> the main question is the nature of the form factor of the lightest neutral scalar fluctuation ( one for each flavor ) . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that this form factor may have a momentum dependence that is similar to that of the mass function . </S>",
    "<S> that is the lowest lying scalar fluctuation of the mass function is close to being a fluctuating multiplicative factor times the mass function . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the attachment of a low momentum scalar to a fermion loop hardly changes the value of the loop , or in other words the amplitude for an additional scalar is close to being @xmath17 times the original amplitude . and @xmath18 , but again the ( small ) difference is due to terms that implement an effective infrared cutoff in the respective loop integrals . </S>",
    "<S> ] this is a property of a linear sigma model description , in which the action is a function of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 symmetry must also be manifest and so the approximate low energy description must be in terms of electroweak scalar doublets fluctuating about their vevs . coupling in 2-flavor qcd from the @xmath21 and @xmath22 partial - wave projection of the elastic @xmath23 scattering amplitude at the @xmath24 pole @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the @xmath25 coupling so obtained agrees very well with the linear sigma model prediction . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling is the analog of the higgs coupling to @xmath26 and @xmath27 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we thus pursue an effective scalar field description in which we have four electroweak doublets , @xmath28 with @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this effective theory need only be well behaved for field values and field momenta less than a compositeness scale , at most a few times a tev . </S>",
    "<S> the four doublets have hypercharge @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 ) have the quantum numbers of the fermion bilinears @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a rough proportionality between the vevs @xmath36 and the underlying dynamical fermion masses @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen in the one loop contribution to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses which can be written approximately in the form @xmath38 @xmath39 or 3 is the color factor and @xmath40 characterizes the scale of significant falloff of the mass function . the large @xmath4 and @xmath5 masses should be similar and they are basically determined so that the correct @xmath41 emerges . </S>",
    "<S> masses around 800 gev would mean that they have roughly the same ratio to @xmath41 as the constituent quark masses have to @xmath42 in qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> we see then that @xmath41 is well below the compositeness scale @xmath43 , as is needed for self - consistency of the effective scalar description . </S>",
    "<S> this also means that yukawa couplings are large , the yukawa coupling of the @xmath44 field to the @xmath45th heavy fermion is @xmath46 . from ( [ e1 ] ) this gives a yukawa coupling @xmath47 for the heavy quarks ; this is pushing into the unitarity bound but this is just a reflection of an underlying strongly interacting ( and unitary ) theory . </S>",
    "<S> also if the yukawa coupling was probed on scales of the order of the compositeness scale or larger , a damping form factor would become apparent .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 mass is likely closer to the @xmath6 mass than to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 masses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we shall be assuming a clear separation between the large vevs @xmath48 and @xmath49 and the smaller vevs @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> to be definite we shall set will simplify our discussion but it is not crucial for our results . ] @xmath52 with @xmath53 so that @xmath54 . in the following this </S>",
    "<S> will lead to an expansion in powers of @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> we label the four neutral scalar mass eigenstates @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ordered from small to large mass . </S>",
    "<S> of most interest is the lightest state @xmath60 with @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> with standard kinetic terms for the @xmath44 the coupling of @xmath56 to @xmath26 and @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of this is unity , the value for the sm higgs boson , which occurs for @xmath63 . in our case </S>",
    "<S> this is @xmath64=\\frac{\\sin\\chi}{\\sqrt{2}}[1/t_\\chi,1,1,1/t_\\chi]$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 has the yukawa couplings @xmath65 to the heavy fermions , and these also take values expected of a higgs boson when @xmath63 . in our framework there is no reason that it is precisely the @xmath63 combination that is a mass eigenstate , but data tells us that the 126 gev state is not too far from it .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now turn to the third question posed above . </S>",
    "<S> a fourth family yields additional loop contributions to higgs couplings to @xmath8 and @xmath9 and these couplings are typically driven very far from sm couplings . at least this is true for the combination @xmath63 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath66 loop amplitude relative to the sm value in the heavy quark loop approximation is @xmath67 , which for @xmath63 is 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the fermion loop contribution to the @xmath68 amplitude relative to the standard top loop contribution is @xmath69 , which for @xmath63 would again be 3 . but instead consider @xmath64=\\frac{\\sin\\chi}{\\sqrt{2}}[-1/t_\\chi,1,1,1/t_\\chi]$ ] . in this case </S>",
    "<S> both of the previous amplitude factors take the value of unity . </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath5 and @xmath7 contributions to these amplitudes were uniformly increased or decreased , perhaps due to some new strong interaction effect we have neglected , then a further shift in @xmath70 could again bring both amplitudes back to unity . ] the @xmath56 coupling to @xmath26 and @xmath27 is then necessarily smaller , but it is only slightly smaller by a factor of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> thus only a change of sign of the small top component of the @xmath56 field , @xmath72 , brings its couplings dramatically closer to the standard values . in the following we </S>",
    "<S> shall be concerned with how this change of sign can arise through a study of the mass matrix for the scalars .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath73 quark and lighter fermions must also have yukawa couplings that are induced by some underlying flavor physics . </S>",
    "<S> these yukawa couplings can in principle involve all of the four scalar doublets @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> for example the @xmath74 down - type quark mass matrix is @xmath75 where the @xmath76 are four yukawa coupling matrices . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile the @xmath56 coupling matrix to the down - type quarks is @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> for the special case @xmath63 these two matrices are proportional and @xmath56 does not have flavor changing couplings . </S>",
    "<S> but when @xmath72 then there can be flavor changing couplings that are suppressed by @xmath78 . the @xmath79 coupling could also receive a @xmath78 correction . </S>",
    "<S> the actual size of these effects is of course dependent on the form and relative sizes of the @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is similar for the charged leptons involving the yukawa matrices @xmath80 , and if for example @xmath81 was small compared to @xmath82 then the correction to the @xmath83 coupling may be smaller than @xmath78 . for </S>",
    "<S> up - type quarks the difference is that the @xmath6 mass comes solely from @xmath84 and the @xmath85 coupling @xmath86 is negative . </S>",
    "<S> this sign has physical effects since it is relative to the still positive top mass .    </S>",
    "<S> there remains the first question posed above : why is there any light scalar at all ? we expect the @xmath87 sector to display an approximate @xmath88 symmetry and so it will be useful to use a notation that makes this explicit . </S>",
    "<S> we define the fields @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( these @xmath91 matrices are not constrained to be unitary ) that both transform like @xmath92 , under @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> mass terms expressed in terms of these fields take the familiar forms ( with @xmath93 ) . @xmath94 </S>",
    "<S> the mass mixing term plays an essential role in 2-higgs - doublet models and it is clearly consistent with the @xmath88 symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now construct the @xmath88 symmetric quartic terms from the @xmath95 and @xmath96 fields . </S>",
    "<S> we have the one trace @xmath97 and the two trace terms @xmath98 more insertions of @xmath96 do not produce new terms .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider one particular degree of freedom @xmath99 where @xmath100 it is easy to see that the contribution to the quartic term @xmath101 is @xmath102 therefore @xmath103 when @xmath104 for @xmath105 , and the mass of this scalar vanishes in this limit for fixed @xmath41 , since @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> thus a light scalar emerges if a certain approximate relation exists between those diagrams where the four scalar fields couple to one or two @xmath107 loops respectively ( corresponding to the one and two trace terms ) . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , as familiar from the 2-higgs - doublet model , if the @xmath108 mass mixing term in ( [ e2 ] ) is large it gives a large mass to the other physical states . </S>",
    "<S> we shall refer to the combination of these two phenomena as the decoupling limit for a light scalar emerging from condensing @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now start to see the type of dynamics that is required to have a light scalar . from large @xmath0 arguments </S>",
    "<S> the two trace terms are @xmath109 suppressed relative to the one trace terms . in fact in nambu - jona - lasinio models the two trace terms are typically ignored by invoking this large @xmath0 argument . the @xmath110 terms are also usually not considered and @xmath111 is estimated to be large @xcite , so this precludes a light scalar . </S>",
    "<S> similarly there is no light scalar in qcd or qcd - like technicolor theories . </S>",
    "<S> the strong interactions must be far away from a large @xmath0 limit to allow for a significant cancellation between the one and two trace terms , and thus we are led to consider a strong @xmath112 gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> ( normal color is an effective flavor with respect to this strong interaction and a two @xmath107 loop diagram has a flavor factor of three relative to a one @xmath107 loop diagram . ) </S>",
    "<S> purely structurally a @xmath112 may be the only choice for a new gauge interaction that acts on a fourth family , and possibly also the third @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we take it to be broken near the tev scale so as to allow the heavy fermions to mix with lighter fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the possible fixed point behavior of a strong @xmath112 at large @xmath113 @xcite may also be of interest in this context .    </S>",
    "<S> the other ingredient of a decoupling limit is the required @xmath114 term . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that @xmath115 is a bosonized version of the operator @xmath116 , and so this operator must be present in the underlying theory </S>",
    "<S> . similarly a replacement of a @xmath95 with a @xmath96 in a quartic term corresponds to an insertion of this operator . </S>",
    "<S> this operator can not be generated perturbatively , and so it represents another distinct feature of the nonperturbative dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this operator may contribute to the breakdown of the @xmath112 , depending on @xmath112 charge assignments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> four - fermion operators of this chirality changing structure have been argued to play a useful role in the generation of other quark and lepton masses @xcite , and in particular the top mass @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the couplings between the @xmath117 , @xmath33 fields and the @xmath118 , @xmath34 fields , where these couplings can be treated as @xmath88 symmetry breaking effects . this will lead to corrections to the decoupling limit that are of order @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we can define additional @xmath91 fields , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and thus obtain additional mass mixing terms in the scalar potential , @xmath121 each of these mass terms again has a corresponding four - fermion interaction in the underlying theory . </S>",
    "<S> we can also consider the quartic terms that are linear in the @xmath118 , @xmath34 fields . </S>",

    "<S> the origin of this term lies with a four - fermion interaction of a certain chiral structure that can not be generated perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> these features of the strong interactions can allow one to be `` accidentally '' close to a decoupling limit for a light scalar . </S>",
    "<S> we also commented on how it can be that a linear sigma model provides a good description of such a scalar .    </S>",
    "<S> the small mass of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 relative to the large mass of @xmath4 and @xmath5 implies a similar ratio of the vevs , and this small ratio determines the size of corrections to the decoupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> it also implies that the light scalar has small @xmath253 and @xmath254 components . </S>",
    "<S> when the relative sign of the @xmath253 component is negative this changes the sign of the scalar coupling to the top quark . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how this can emerge via a 4-higgs - doublet potential and how it is needed to bring @xmath8 and @xmath9 couplings into line with the observed values . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally the sign of the higgs coupling to the top is accessible through the study of higgs boson plus single top production @xcite . </S>"
