    "optical designs of near - infrared ( 1.0 - 2.4 ) instruments are strongly constrained by a limited selection of near - infrared optical materials .",
    "low - index materials such as caf@xmath4 , baf@xmath4 , lif , nacl , and infrared grade fused quartz are commonly used for windows and simple achromatic doublets . however , these low - index materials have a restricted range of dispersive power that prevents good chromatic correction in complex , high - performance optical designs .",
    "in addition , nacl , lif , and baf@xmath4 are hygroscopic and prone to damage .",
    "zinc selenide ( znse ) is another material suitable for near - infrared lenses , but its high index and large dispersive power limits its usefulness .",
    "in addition , the high index of znse makes it difficult to design broadband anti - reflection coatings .",
    "the internal transmission of most optical glasses with _ intermediate _ indices and dispersive powers is typically poor at near - infrared wavelengths , but the internal transmission of the glass is a fortunate exception .",
    "figure [ fig : intrans ] shows that a 10-mm thick piece of has an internal transmission of 98.7% at 2.0  and 95.3% at 2.4 .",
    "the dispersive power of is @xmath5 at 1.0  and @xmath6 at 2.0 . to compare this with other infrared materials ,",
    "we refer the reader to table 1 of @xcite , which sorts twenty four infrared materials by dispersive power .",
    "the intermediate dispersive power of is quite similar to the schott glass tifn5 and somewhat similar to the older schott glass irg7 .",
    "however , tifn5 and irg7 are no longer available as stock glasses .",
    "the intermediate dispersive power of is extremely valuable for high - performance , near - infrared optical designs .",
    "for example , is a critical part of the optical designs of flamingos-2 , a near - infrared multi - slit spectrograph and imager for gemini south @xcite , and mmirs , an instrument based on flamingos-2 for the f/5 mmt and magellan telescopes @xcite .",
    "near - infrared astronomical instruments like flamingos-2 and mmirs operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures ( 77 k ) in order to reduce thermal background .",
    "the flamingos-2 and mmirs optical designs are sensitive to index uncertainties of a few parts in 10@xmath7 .",
    "thus we need to know the refractive index , @xmath8 , of at cryogenic temperatures near @xmath177 k and at near - infrared wavelengths to be sure that the optics of flamingos-2 and mmirs will perform properly .",
    "two large s - ftm16 blanks were purchased from ohara corporation for the flamingos-2 spectrograph optics .",
    "we had a small prism made from one of the blanks , and we sent the prism to ohara to obtain melt indices .",
    "on 29 august 2003 , ohara obtained index measurements relative to air at room temperature ( 25 @xmath9c ) and at sea level ( 760 torr ) .",
    "measurement accuracy was stated to be @xmath10 .",
    "table [ tab : ohara ] presents the 12 optical / near - infrared lines we obtained .",
    "we were unable , however , to obtain cryogenic index measurements commercially .           here",
    ", we report our measurements of @xmath11 , the change in refractive index for between room temperature and @xmath177 k. we will determine cryogenic index by converting its melt indices in air to absolute indices in vacuum , and then adding our value of absolute @xmath11 .",
    "physically , the temperature dependence of the refractive index depends on a material s density and its electrical properties @xcite .",
    "materials expand and contract with temperature , thus density is temperature dependent .",
    "this is quantified by a material s coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) , which is wavelength independent .",
    "electrically , a material can be neutral while its constituent atoms and ions have dipole moments that cause a macroscopic polarizability . the refractive index and dielectric constant depend on this macroscopic polarizability .",
    "the macroscopic polarizability is wavelength dependent . because the ordering of microscopic dipole moments in a material depends on temperature , the macroscopic polarizability is also temperature dependent . generally speaking , microscopic dipole moments will experience the most re - ordering near the melting point , and the least re - ordering near 0 k. this suggests we may not see a strong contribution from the macroscopic polarizability in our temperature regime .",
    "interestingly , the refractive index changes due to density and polarizability are usually opposite in sign .",
    "refractive index changes due to density tend to produce a negative @xmath12 , and those due to polarizability tend to produce a positive @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the balance of the two effects determines the final magnitude and sign of @xmath12 .",
    "the ohara catalog contains thermo - optical measurements for , but for the limited temperature range -30 @xmath9c to + 70 @xmath9c and for the limited wavelength range 0.435835  to 1.01398 .",
    "table [ tab : oharadndt ] summarizes the thermo - optical coefficients for presented in the ohara catalog , converted to an absolute @xmath12 .",
    "absolute @xmath12 refers to a material with a vacuum / glass interface as opposed to a relative @xmath12 which refers to an air / glass interface . throughout this paper",
    "we discuss absolute @xmath12 , or @xmath13 .",
    "it is apparent from table [ tab : oharadndt ] that @xmath13 of varies with wavelength and           temperature .",
    "we note that the dependence of @xmath13 with wavelength and temperature decreases as the temperature drops and the wavelength increases , trends that are favorable for our application .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : cryorefrac ] by describing the experimental apparatus we used to measure cryogenic refractive indices .",
    "we discuss the experimental data and errors in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "we then present our measurements of refractive index , thermo - optical coefficients , and cryogenic cte in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we used the cryogenic refractometer at the university of arizona optical sciences center to measure the change of the refractive index between room and cryogenic temperatures .",
    "the cryogenic refractometer is an instrument built by j.  palmer and collaborators @xcite that uses the modified minimum deviation method of @xcite to measure indices of refraction ( see figure [ fig : cryorefrac ] ) .",
    "the advantage of the modified minimum deviation method is that it allows a prism to be mounted in a fixed cryogenic dewar .",
    "the disadvantage of the modified minimum deviation method is that it provides a less precise refractive index measurement compared to the more traditional minimum deviation and littrow methods ( because the collimated beam of light makes only a single pass through our prism ) .",
    "optical glass manufacturers , using traditional methods , can provide index measurements with precisions as good as @xmath14 at room temperature . by comparison ,",
    "our measurements have precisions of @xmath15 at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "the layout of the cryogenic refractometer is shown in figure [ fig : cryorefrac ] .",
    "the refractometer measures the deviation angle , @xmath16 , of a collimated beam of light of wavelength @xmath17 that passes through a prism at temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the prism s refractive index @xmath19 is found from @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the apex angle of the prism and @xmath16 is the angle between the undeviated and deviated beams of light .",
    "the test prism was mounted in a copper fixture inside the dewar .",
    "temperatures between 60 k and 77 k were obtained by pumping on the ln@xmath4 reservoir ; temperatures between 77 k and 100 k were obtained with a heater adjacent to the prism .",
    "temperatures were measured with two silicon diodes .",
    "one diode was located between the prism and the heater and the other was located on the copper fixture below the prism .",
    "the refractometer uses a ln@xmath4-cooled hgcdte detector for 1.1 - 2.6  measurements and a room - temperature si detector for 0.5 - 1.2  measurements .",
    "we measured the angle @xmath16 by rotating the detector on a precision rotary turntable ( socit genevoise pi-4 ) to locate the undeviated and deviated beams .",
    "the collimated beam was large enough to pass both through the prism ( deviated ) and around the prism ( undeviated ) .",
    "we used a chopper and lock - in amplifier to improve the signal - to - noise of the beams .",
    "we used a tungsten ribbon - filament lamp as the light source for all of our measurements .",
    "a 300 line mm@xmath3 grating inside a jarrell ash model 27 monochromator selected the desired wavelength .",
    "we used the 300 line mm@xmath3 grating in first , second , and third orders to cover our full wavelength range .",
    "a 250  exit slit provided a spectral bandwidth ranging from 3 to 1 nm fwhm , depending on the grating order .",
    "we measured the refractive index as follows .",
    "first , we allowed the prism temperature to stabilize .",
    "we then auto - collimated the prism to the collimated beam of light .",
    "we selected the desired wavelength with the jarrell ash monochrometer , using an order blocking filter as necessary .",
    "finally , we rotated the arm holding the detector and located the undeviated and deviated beams .",
    "we repeated the last two steps until all wavelengths at a given temperature were measured .",
    "the spatial profile of the collimated beam at the detector was the convolution of two narrow rectangle slits and so appeared approximately gaussian in shape . to locate the peak of the profile",
    ", we obtained 5 to 10 observations around the centers of the undeviated and deviated beams .",
    "each observation required manually rotating the turntable and reading the turntable s position with a vernier scale .",
    "we solved for the final deviation angle @xmath16 by fitting gaussians to the undeviated and deviated profiles , and then calculating the angular difference between the centers of the beams .",
    "we measured the refractive index of at 17 wavelengths between 0.546  and 2.600  and at 5 temperatures ( 62 k , 78 k @xmath22 , 87 k , 97 k , and 296 k ) .",
    "a second set of measurements at 296 k was obtained in air with the dewar windows removed .",
    "table [ tab : data ] summarizes the measured wavelengths : column 1 lists those wavelengths measured with the si detector and column 2 lists those wavelengths measured with the hgcdte detector .",
    "we had planned to obtain additional measurements at temperatures between 100 k and room temperature , but the refractometer was unable to operate at these temperatures .",
    "we measured the undeviated and deviated beams two to four times at each wavelength and temperature , yielding a raw data set of 3,246 individual observations and a reduced data set of 120 refractive indices .",
    "the measurements were obtained over five days in november 2003 .",
    "our measurements contain both statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the systematic errors are much larger than the statistical errors , but the systematic errors are mostly removable .",
    "for example , we measure the wedge of the dewar windows by comparing room temperature measurements with and without the dewar windows in place .",
    "similarly , we measure the focus offset between the si and hgcdte detectors by observing @xmath23 and @xmath24  with both detectors .",
    "however , when we compare the ohara melt indices with our room temperature measurements ( see figure [ fig : oc3 ] ) , we find a residual systematic offset at the @xmath25 level that varies with wavelength .",
    "this systematic offset is likely due to mechanical error in the turntable .",
    "the socit instruments physique pi-4 is specified to have @xmath26 accuracy , but the turntable we used was relatively old and the experimenter ( w.  brown ) noticed that the rotary handle had variable resistance in different areas .",
    "this suggests that the rotary mechanism has lost its original accuracy .",
    "we can fit and remove the systematic table error , but in doing so we would introduce additional uncertainty in the final index measurement .",
    "we can avoid systematic errors altogether by focusing on the @xmath11 measurement of s - ftm16 . the window wedge ,",
    "detector offset , and rotary table error are independent of temperature , and so in principle cancel out when calculating @xmath27 .",
    "the error in individual @xmath27 values is thus dominated by the statistical error in the index measurements .",
    "most of the sources of statistical error in the index measurements are angular uncertainties in the experimental apparatus that transform to uncertainties in the index @xmath8 via eqn .",
    "[ eqn : n ] .",
    "table [ tab : error ] summarizes these errors .",
    "we estimate the error in the deviation angle measurement from the residuals of the gaussian profile fits .",
    "the residuals of the gaussian profile fits are typically @xmath28 for the si detector and @xmath29 for the hgcdte detector . summing the undeviated and deviated beam uncertainties in quadrature",
    ", the uncertainty in the deviation angle contributes errors of @xmath30 and @xmath31 to @xmath8 for the si and hgcdte detectors , respectively .",
    "we measured the apex angle @xmath21 of the prism on a wild 79 spectrometer .",
    "the average of ten measurements was @xmath32 .",
    "this is statistically identical to ohara corporation s measurement of the apex angle , @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 uncertainty in the apex angle contributes an error of @xmath35 to @xmath8 , and has a small wavelength dependence .",
    "the deviation angle measurement assumes that the prism is aligned with the undeviated collimated beam of light .",
    "the autocollimation of the prism is set by aligning the retro - reflected beam from the prism face onto the exit slit of the jarrell ash monochrometer .",
    "the retro - reflected beam can be set with an uncertainty of @xmath36 .",
    "we maintain the autocollimation by shining a he - ne laser onto the prism face and making sure the reflected spot on the wall ( @xmath18 m away ) does not move . if the prism shifts ( i.e.  due to changes in temperature ) we tip / tilt the dewar to compensate .",
    "the laser spot center can be maintained to @xmath37 .",
    "summing these uncertainties in quadrature , the autocollimation of the prism contributes an error of @xmath38 to @xmath8 .",
    "we calibrated the wavelength readings on the jarrell ash spectrometer with higher orders of a he - ne alignment laser .",
    "a linear fit with wavelength leaves excessive residuals , and so our final calibration uses a cubic fit .",
    "the residuals of the fit are @xmath39 nm . in addition , the dial on the spectrometer was read with a precision of @xmath40 nm . summing these uncertainties in quadrature ,",
    "the total error in the wavelengths is @xmath41 nm . propagating this through the schott equation shows that the wavelength uncertainty contributes an error of @xmath42 to @xmath8 .",
    "we average the temperature readings of the diodes above and below the prism to obtain the prism temperature .",
    "because the observed temperature gradient across the prism is always less than @xmath43c at equilibrium , we conservatively estimate the uncertainty in the prism temperature to be @xmath44c .",
    "propagating this through a @xmath12 relation shows that the temperature uncertainty contributes an error of @xmath45 to @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath46 accuracy of the ohara melt information is superior to our measurements , and so we report ohara s melt values for room temperature           index relative to air ( table [ tab : ohara ] ) .",
    "we fit the ohara melt values with the six coefficient schott formula , @xmath47 where @xmath17 is in .",
    "the best - fit schott coefficients are presented in table [ tab : zemax ] .",
    "the residuals of the best - fit schott function are @xmath48 in @xmath8 .",
    "it is important to obtain melt information because refractive index will vary from melt to melt .    because this paper is primarily concerned with absolute indices , table [ tab : zemax ] also presents the best - fit schott coefficients for in vacuum .",
    "we correct the ohara indices from air to vacuum by multiplying the indices by the refractive index of air @xmath49 . the refractive index of air at 25 @xmath9c , 760 torr , and in the wavelength range 1 to 2.6  is @xmath50 @xcite , with a well - determined wavelength dependence at the @xmath51 level .",
    "the air - to - vacuum transformation adds negligible error to the values of @xmath8 .",
    "we determine absolute cryogenic refractive index by calculating the difference between our cryogenic and room temperature vacuum measurements .",
    "calculating the difference in index minimizes the effects of systematic errors and any uncertainty in the calibration of our data .",
    "our series of absolute index measurements thus reduces to a series of absolute @xmath11 values between @xmath177 k and room temperature .",
    "we look for wavelength - dependent terms in the @xmath52 values , but , because of the relatively coarse @xmath15 precision of our indices , we do not find wavelength- or temperature - dependent terms statistically significant .",
    "our vacuum indices provide a direct measurement of absolute @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig : dndt ] plots the values of absolute @xmath52 between our four cryogenic temperatures and room temperature .",
    "measurements are plotted against wavelength .",
    "we have two data sets at room temperature that we use as comparison .",
    "the room temperature measurements in air have been corrected to vacuum .",
    "the grand average of all the values , shown by the dotted line in figure [ fig : dndt ] , is @xmath53 k@xmath3 .",
    "we see apparent wavelength - dependent structure in the @xmath52 measurements , but we determine that this wavelength - dependent structure is not significant with respect to a constant fit .",
    "figure [ fig : meanwl ] plots all of our @xmath11 measurements together .",
    "physically , we expect @xmath11 to have wavelength dependence , but we expect the wavelength dependence to be small at our temperatures and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "when we test high order wavelength fits to the @xmath11 data set , we find that the reduced @xmath54 and the rms residuals do not significantly improve with respect to a constant @xmath11 .",
    "for example , the linear fit in figure [ fig : meanwl ] reduces the rms residuals by a mere 6% .",
    "furthermore , the linear fit deviates from a constant @xmath11 by @xmath55 k@xmath3 ( a factor of three smaller than our uncertainty ) within the wavelength range 1  to 2.6 .",
    "we plot values of @xmath11 averaged over temperature ( lower panel , figure [ fig : meanwl ] ) to further explore the possibility of wavelength - depen-                      dent structure .",
    "the error bars show the rms of the @xmath11 values at that wavelength .",
    "only one of the 15 points differs by 2 @xmath56 from a constant @xmath11 ; eleven points agree to better than 1 @xmath56 with a constant @xmath11 .",
    "thus the data appears well described by a constant @xmath11 . because the error on the mean is negligible ,",
    "we conclude that the @xmath57 k@xmath3 uncertainty is dominated by residual systematic errors in the measurements .",
    "we now investigate temperature dependence in the @xmath58 measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : meant ] plots the @xmath11 values averaged over wavelength .",
    "error bars show the rms for the @xmath52 values at that temperature .",
    "our cryogenic measurements span 62 k to 97 k , and we see no obvious trend in this range of temperatures .",
    "thus @xmath11 is well described by a constant value in the temperature range 62 k to 97 k.    we compare with ohara catalog @xmath12 values as a check of our measurements .",
    "note that we measure a single , integrated @xmath58 value between room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperatures while ohara , on the other hand , measures @xmath12 in small temperature and wavelength ranges . a comparison can be made only if we integrate the @xmath12 values over temperature and compare the changes in index , @xmath59 .",
    "figure [ fig : dndt6a ] shows the change in absolute index at 1.0140 , normalized to 0 at 298 k , for ohara s integrated @xmath12 values and our @xmath11 measurements ( from figure [ fig : meant ] ) .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ fig : dndt6a ] shows our @xmath60 k@xmath3 between 298 k and 77 k. our @xmath11 nicely matchs the ohara @xmath11 values near room temperature .",
    "the cryogenic index of in vacuum is found by adding the @xmath61 for the desired @xmath62 .",
    "going from room           temperature 298 k to liquid nitrogen temperature 77 k , the absolute @xmath63 ( see figure [ fig : dndt6a ] ) .",
    "finally , we investigate the effect of the 10% uncertainty in @xmath11 on a high - performance optical design .",
    "the mmt magellan infrared spectrograph ( mmirs ) optical design , for example , uses two elements in the camera @xcite . changing in mmirs by @xmath64 results in a small 0.3% change in rms spot size and a @xmath65  re - focus .",
    "thus our 10% determination of @xmath11 is more than adequate to maintain the high performance of the mmirs optical design .",
    "we obtain cryogenic cte measurements so that properly athermalized lens mounts can be designed for . on 13 april 2004 harrop industries , inc , performed a thermal dilatometric analysis on a sample of cut from the same block as our prism .",
    "the sample was first cooled to 100 k ( colder temperatures were not possible with the apparatus ) , and then the sample s length was measured with a dilatometer as it slowly warmed up .",
    "the result is a direct measurement of integrated linear thermal expansion between 100 k and 298 k.    figure [ fig : dlt ] shows integrated linear thermal expansion with respect to 298 k. there is a clear second - order term in the data , and the solid line shows the best - fit quadratic @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the length at temperature @xmath18 ( in k ) , and @xmath68 is the length at 298 k. the dashed line in figure [ fig : dlt ] shows the extrapolation of this fit to 70 k. the integrated linear           thermal expansion of between 298 k and 77 k is -0.00167 @xmath69 .",
    "figure [ fig : cte ] shows cte with temperature .",
    "the cte is simply the slope of the integrated linear thermal expansion line at a given temperature .",
    "the cte values in figure [ fig : cte ] are calculated by binning 16 dilatometer measurements together in approximately 9 k intervals ; the error bars show the rms of the measurements in a given bin .",
    "the solid line drawn through the cte values in figure [ fig : cte ] is given by @xmath70 where cte has units of k@xmath3 and @xmath18 has units of k. the dashed line in figure [ fig : cte ] shows the extrapolation of this fit to 70 k. we find that cte is a smoothly varying , positive quantity between 100 k and 298 k , consistent with our @xmath11 .",
    "ohara reports a cte of @xmath71 k@xmath3 between 240 k and 340 k , which is in good agreement with our cte measurements .",
    "the glass is an important addition to the list of optical materials for near - infrared instruments .",
    "the glass has @xmath72 internal transmission out to 2.4 , and is currently the only intermediate dispersion material available to near - infrared optical designs .",
    "high - performance optical designs require accurate knowledge of material properties , especially at the cryogenic temperatures at which near - infrared instruments operate .",
    "thus we have undertaken cryogenic refractive index measurements for .",
    "our measurements were made with the cryogenic refractometer at the university of arizona .",
    "the experimental apparatus uses the modified minimum deviation method to measure refractive index .",
    "individual measurements have @xmath15 precision in @xmath8 .",
    "we use ohara s high accuracy melt information to define relative refractive index at room temperature .",
    "we convert the relative indices to absolute indices .",
    "we then use our vacuum measurements to calculate the change in refractive index between room temperature and 77 k , independent of systematic errors .",
    "we find @xmath73 k@xmath3 , valid in the wavelength range 0.6 to 2.6  and between room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperatures .",
    "this corresponds to an absolute @xmath74 between 298 k and 77 k. we find no statistical evidence for wavelength- or temperature - dependent terms to the uncertainty of our measurements .",
    "the 10% accuracy of our @xmath75 determination is more than adequate to maintain the high - performance of the mmirs optical design . the integrated linear thermal expansion of between 298 k and 77 k is -0.00167 @xmath69 .",
