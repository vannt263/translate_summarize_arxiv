    "seyfert galaxies harbor active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with typical redshifts @xmath0 0.1 and moderate luminosities that vary over a range of time scales from days to years and over a factor of @xmath110 in amplitude .",
    "agn have supermassive black holes consuming nearby gas and/or stars ; the accretion disk surrounding the black hole is presumably the source for their high apparent luminosity and continuum variability .",
    "seyfert galaxies are classified as types 1 and 2 .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies have narrow ( @xmath1500 km s@xmath2 full width half maximum [ fwhm ] ) forbidden and permitted emission lines and broad ( @xmath3 1000 km fwhm ) permitted lines , while seyfert 2 have only narrow permitted and forbidden emission lines .",
    "( khachikian & weedman 1974 ) .",
    "ultraviolet spectra of seyfert galaxies are notable for their strong continuum variability , which is not as pronounced in the visual regime ( e.g. , ngc 4151 , kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ began monitoring agn in 1978 and collected a large number of uv spectra through 1995 , while the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on board the _ hst _ collected spectra from 1990 through 1997 .",
    "although the origin of the uv continuum is still elusive , it is currently believed that it is radiated from the accretion disk .",
    "comparisons of variability in the uv with other regions of the spectrum places important constraints on the physics involved ( e.g.,nandra & papadakis 2001 ) .",
    "thus , it is important to have a comprehensive and uniform database of uv light curves for comparison with continuum observations at other wavelengths .    from the massive collection of _ iue _ and fos spectra , we have compiled continuum light curves and created a database that is internet accessible .",
    "our list of targets includes any object that has been designated a seyfert galaxy by the observing astronomer for any observation with either _ iue _ or _",
    "hst_. also , we have limited the selection list via redshift , including only objects with a redshift z @xmath4 0.2 .",
    "our database is the first effort to make agn uv light curves readily available via the world wide web .",
    "the only previous effort was an atlas of _ iue _ spectra of seyfert galaxies observed prior to 1991 january 1 ( courvoisier & paltani 1992 ) .",
    "the database we have created is inclusive of all _ iue _ and fos spectra through their final years , and has the capability to receive further observations provided by sources such as the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) , space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , and the _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut)_. this information should be helpful for a number of studies , including those that require 1 ) the history of the uv continuum variations for an individual seyfert galaxy , 2 ) a comparison of uv fluxes with measurements in other regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum for any given epoch , and 3 ) detailed statistical analyses ( e.g. , cross - correlation , structure functions ) of the uv continuum properties of agn .",
    "_ iue _ was launched on 1978 january 26 and operated successfully until 30 september 1996 , when it was decommissioned . _ iue _ had the capability to perform spectroscopy at two different resolutions .",
    "the high resolution mode operated at a spectral resolution of 0.1   to 0.3   ( fwhm ) , while the low resolution mode performed at 6   to 7   ( fwhm ) .",
    "_ iue _ had two apertures available for spectroscopy : large ( 10 x 20 arcsec ) and small ( 3 arcsec in diameter ) . due to the faintness of seyfert galaxies ,",
    "the high - resolution mode is unsuitable for continuum studies .",
    "observations through the small aperture are unsuitable for absolute photometry due to the large ( @xmath1 50% ) and variable light loss .",
    "thus we used only large - aperture , low - dispersion spectra for the light curves .",
    "_ iue _ utilized a total of four cameras : the long wavelength prime and redundant cameras ( lwp and lwr ) and the short wavelength prime and redundant cameras ( swp and swr ) , which operated at 1850    to 3200   and 1150   to 2000   respectively .",
    "the swr camera was only used for a handful of observations early on , and no useful data on seyfert galaxies were obtained .",
    "both the lwp and lwr cameras were used to make observations over the lifetime of _",
    "iue_. during _ iue _",
    "s early life the lwr camera dominated the observing ; during the later years the lwp camera become the dominant camera due to a flare that developed in the lwr .",
    "the fos was one of the initial spectrographs installed on the _ hst _ , which was launched in 1990 .",
    "it remained on board hubble until 1997 .",
    "there are two versions of the fos data , pre - costar and post - costar , corresponding to data obtained before and after the optics were repaired on _ hst _ in 1994 january .",
    "the optics correction caused a slight change in the aperture sizes , but there were no major effects on the quality of the data .",
    "we chose to use data from all apertures , since aperture corrections for the fos are highly reliable .",
    "the fos had two spectral resolutions available , high ( @xmath5/@xmath6@xmath5 @xmath11300 ) and low ( @xmath5/@xmath6@xmath5 @xmath1 250 ) .",
    "for our sample we chose to use the high - resolution grating due to the short exposure times and resulting poor signal - to - noise in the low resolution spectra .",
    "although the fos gratings covered both the uv and visible regimes , we chose to use only the uv data , from gratings g130h , g190h and g270h with wavelength ranges spanning 1000  1700  1700  2200   and 2200  3000   respectively .",
    "for our purposes , every available spectrum was obtained using the mast interface .",
    "the first objective was to create a single averaged spectrum per agn from a short list of viable candidates , to identify suitable continuum regions .",
    "we chose ngc 5548 , ngc 4151 , fairall 9 and mrk 509 , primarily due to their numerous _",
    "iue _ observations ( 367 , 984 , 233 , and 97 observations , respectively ) . to view the common emission lines ,",
    "the average spectra were de - redshifted and plotted together , as shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "we determined from the figures where continuum flux measurements were possible with little chance of an emission or absorption line altering the flux measurements .",
    "the best locations for the swp camera measurements fell at 1355 , 1720 , and 1810 with bin sizes of 30 , 30 , and 50  , whereas the lwp / lwr camera bins fell at 2200 , 2400 and 2740   with bin sizes of 50 , 60 and 30  , all in the rest frame of the galaxy .",
    "note that fluxes in the 2200   bin are rather noisy compared to the other bins , due to the low sensitivities of the cameras in this region .",
    "our next step was to remove flawed spectra from the sample .",
    "several reasons arose to eliminate an _",
    "spectrum from the light curve list .",
    "one such reason was overexposure .",
    "the _ iue _",
    "cameras had a limited dynamic range , such that the raw counts ( in data numbers [ dn ] ) could not exceed the value of 255 .",
    "although in most cases only the emission lines were overexposed , we decided to be cautious and not use overexposed images for our continuum measurements .",
    "another problem that appeared was heavy background noise during periods of _ iue _ s orbit .",
    "iue _ orbited the earth it would daily fall into the van allen belts .",
    "these events would send background counts up to high levels , thereby making the continuum fluxes very noisy .",
    "low to moderate background values turned out to be between 50 and 100 dn , above 100 dn was considered a high value , and above 200 dn as unusable . to set a standard limit ,",
    "we have omitted any spectra with background @xmath3 100 dn . during _ iue _",
    "s later years , sunlight leaked into the telescope and added an extended source of light at wavelengths longer than 2500  .",
    "all spectra observed after 1990 that exhibited an unusually large increase in continuum slope in the lwr and lwp images due to this effect were excluded from our light curves .",
    "other less prominent events affected the _ iue _ spectra , but were either rare or did not affect the continuum flux .",
    "we provide in our web site a list of spectra for each object that were removed from our measurements along with a key of explanations as to what events occurred to exclude the spectra .    once we established a quality standard , we shifted our predetermined wavelength bins by 1+z to measure the fluxes in the object s frame .",
    "for example , in ngc 4151 ( z @xmath7 0.0033 ) the swp bin positions shifted to 1359 , 1725 , and 1816  .",
    "when redshifting a bin near the edge of a spectrum , the 1810 bin in the swp and the 2740 bin in the lwp camera would occasionally fall off the spectrum and yield a null result .",
    "this occurance is the reason for a redshift limit of z @xmath4 0.2 in our selection list .",
    "as discussed previously , the fos had three fixed grating ranges available .",
    "this meant that unlike the _ iue _ dataset , there was typically one bin in the g130h ( the 1355   bin ) , three bins in the g190h ( the 1720 , 1810 and 2200   bins ) and two bins in the g270h ( the 2400 and 2740   bins ) spectra .",
    "when examining light curves comprised of data from each source , it should be noted that the quality of spectra for measurements in the 1355 and the 1720 bins on the fos could be vastly different , yet with _ iue _ observations these two bins were obtained at the same time and with the same camera and thus less likely to contain deviations from one another .",
    "once the measurements were made , we plotted the average flux in each bin versus the julian date of the midpoint of each exposure , calculated from the start time of the observation and the exposure length , which were taken from the file header provided by mast . in order to extend the time span in which objects were monitored , we combined the light curves from fos and",
    "_ iue_. an example of these results is displayed for ngc 4151 in figure 3 , along with a `` zoomed in '' section in figure 4 . in these light curves , it is obvious that over long time frames ( years ) the flux can change by a factor of 10 , as previously mentioned . in figure 4",
    "it can be seen that small flux changes occurred over the course of three days time in the intense monitoring campaign during this time period .",
    "this is one of the few occasions in which the observations did not undersample the continuum variations ( crenshaw et al . 1996 ) .",
    "continuum fluxes at the level of @xmath12 @xmath8 10@xmath9 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath10 @xmath2 or smaller are unreliable , due to camera artifacts and uncertain background levels in the _ iue _ cameras ( crenshaw et al .",
    "note that extended continuum sources , such as starbursts or scattering regions often found in seyfert 2 galaxies , could show apparent flux variability due to the different aperture sizes used by _",
    "iue _ and the fos .",
    "in order to determine the uncertainties in the _ iue _ fluxes , we began by establishing the average of the continuum in each bin , illustrated by the horizontal line in figure 5 , and then measured the standard deviation ( @xmath11 ) of the points within the designated bins .",
    "this method for _ iue _ error determination is known to overestimate the uncertainties ( clavel et al .",
    "1991 ) . because the _ iue _ cameras were not photon counters and the spectra",
    "were highly oversampled , there are approximately 4 spectral points per wavelength resolution element .    for our measurements we concluded that a method of adjusting the error bars similar to the method of clavel et al .",
    "( 1991 ) is optimal . on time",
    "scales less than 1  2 days , previous studies have shown that the uv continuum variations in seyfert galaxies are small ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "thus any apparent continuum variablity exhibited on very short time scales in the _ iue _ data is likely dominated by photon and/or instrument noise . to test this notion",
    ", we did combinatorics of all points in each light curve , for several objects that contained at least tens of observations , to find the fractional change in flux ( @xmath6f ) and time ( @xmath6 t ) between any two points ( it should be noted that this is similar to a structure function method ) .",
    "figure 6 shows a plot of @xmath6f against ( @xmath6 t ) for each pair of points in figure 3 .",
    "as expected , as the time interval grows , the maximum change in flux grows .",
    "the leveling off of points on time intervals less than @xmath11 day confirms that there is no significant excess variability above the noise level ( with the exception of a few points ) on short time scales .",
    "we took measurements of the light curve points contained within a rectangle between log(@xmath6t / days ) of -1.5 and -0.5 and between log(@xmath6f ) of 0.0 and 0.15 in figure 6 to characterize the noise .",
    "we define the reproducibility r as the average of the fractional variations in the time bin .",
    "r represents an upper limit to the flux uncertainty ( on average ) , since we can not rule out the possibility of small variations on these short time scales . the mean measured error ( emean )",
    "is given by the average of all of the uncertainties ( @xmath11s ) in this time interval .",
    "the overestimation of the error is given by the ratio of the mean measured error emean and the reproducibility ( r ) .",
    "thus , if we divide our individual @xmath11 s by this ratio , we obtain an estimate of the noise in each measurement , but scaled appropriately .",
    "we repeated the above procedure for a number of well - observed seyfert galaxies . in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 we present the necessary data to determine the overestimation of the error for each camera .",
    "maxjd and maxfl are the logarithmic limits we imposed on the region of the plot of @xmath6f vs. @xmath6jd to determine the reproducibility .",
    "ratio is the average error ( emean ) divided by the reproducibility ( r ) , or , in other words , the factor by which the original errors have been overestimated .",
    "the reciprocal of the ratio averaged over all objects gives the final scaling factor for theoriginal errors .",
    "the average ratios are 1.69 @xmath12 0.34 , 2.40 @xmath12 0.77 , and 1.75 @xmath12 0.31 for the swp , lwr , and lwp cameras respectively . for the fos data , in the few instances where we have multiple observations of an object over short time scales , we see no evidence that the error bars require additional scaling .",
    "we have created a web site to make our uv light curves of seyfert galaxies available to the community .",
    "users can access our web site at www.chara.gsu.edu/pega/iue .",
    "we chose to create a mysql database to store the data and build our web site with perl cgi scripts .",
    "the opening page is a tabular list of the objects for which we have data , sorted by right ascension ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "users can use their web browser s `` find '' function to locate an object by name .",
    "the main page presents not only the list of objects and positions , but their respective redshifts and a link to the light curve for each bin that was measured ( the central position of the bin is given in the observed frame ) . for each link",
    ", we provide an on - the - fly light curve generator ( figure 8) .",
    "the user is able to adjust the time frame or the flux range within the window to allow for a zoom . for each light curve",
    ", users can left click on any point to access the observing information for that point .",
    "we also provide a link to the information for all observations in the band pass , as well as the light curve in tabular form ( julian date , fluxes , and scaled uncertainties ) for downloading , as shown in figure 9 .",
