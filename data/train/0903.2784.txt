    "double quantum dots ( dqds ) are pairs of quantum dots ( qds ) placed at a small distance from each other and coupled either by long - range dipole forces @xcite or by carrier tunneling through the inter - dot barrier @xcite ( in the latter case , the system is referred to as a quantum dot molecule ) .",
    "such systems attract much attention both in the theoretical and experimental research .",
    "this still growing interest is driven to a large extent by the technological promise these structures show for nanoelectronics and quantum information processing applications .",
    "a system built of two qds can be viewed as a first step towards scalable semiconductor - based quantum devices .",
    "coupling between the dots is essential here , as it allows one to induce conditional dynamics in the system and thus to realize the basic elements of quantum computing @xcite .",
    "another interesting application of coupled qds is generation of entangled photons @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that much experimental work has been devoted to proving the existence of coupling in dqd systems @xcite .    in this paper , we study the four - wave mixing ( fwm ) optical response of an inhomogeneous ensemble of self - assembled double quantum dots . the systems under consideration are qd pairs formed spontaneously by strain - induced nucleation , as is typical , e.g. , in the inas / gaas system @xcite ( although , in fact , the exact arrangement of the qds is not essential in our discussion ) .",
    "the fwm spectroscopy is an optical technique commonly used for extracting information on lifetimes and homogeneous dephasing from inhomogeneous ensembles @xcite .",
    "it has been also applied to dqd ensembles @xcite , showing features that are clearly distinct from those observed in ensembles of individual qds , like two - component decay and modified initial dephasing . as the physical properties of dqds are much more complex than those of individual qds it is not always possible to identify the mechanism responsible for these differences .",
    "in particular , it is not clear to which extent they may result from simple optical interference or quantum - optical mechanisms of collective radiative decay ( sub- and superradiance ) , as opposed , e.g. , to dqd - specific phonon - related dephasing channels , like dissipative exciton transfer @xcite .",
    "superradiance has been thoroughly studied for strongly excited atomic samples @xcite , where it is manifested as an outburst of radiation due to constructive interference of quantum - mechanical amplitudes for radiative transition in a massively correlated state of atoms interacting with a common radiation reservoir .",
    "somewhat less spectacular form of this effect was also observed in qd ensembles @xcite where the radiative recombination was shown to increase for a sufficiently large number of dots .",
    "however , the essential features of the collective emission can be observed already in a two - emitter system : states with a delocalized excitation decay slower or faster , depending on the relative phase between the two components in the superposition ( the first or the second emitter excited ) @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present work is to identify the purely optical effects that may appear in the nonlinear optical response of an ensemble of dqds .",
    "it has been pointed out that the dynamics of double dots coupled to a radiative reservoir is very reach , both in the open space @xcite and in a cavity @xcite . here",
    ", we will show that the exponential decay of optical coherence , characteristic of a single qd , is replaced by a non - exponential , two - rate decay which may be related to sub- and superradiant components in the system evolution .",
    "as in the previously studied case of a single pair of nearly identical qds @xcite , the decay is strongly affected by the coupling between the dots .",
    "we show that the collective features in the radiative decay persist even for relatively large values of the energy mismatch between the dots ( many orders of magnitude larger that the emission line width ) as long as the coupling is of comparable magnitude .",
    "another feature that emerges from our model is a damped oscillatory behavior of the fwm signal at short delays ( sub - picosecond and picosecond time scales ) , which results from the optical interference of the signals emitted by various dqds in the ensemble , dephased due to inhomogeneity of dqd parameters .",
    "as we will show , these beats may be dominated by a relatively long - living contribution from the minority subensemble of resonant dqds ( formed by dots with identical transition energies ) . in this way",
    ", the nonlinear response contains information on the coupling between the dots , irrespective of the energy mismatch between them .",

    "we assume that the polarization of the laser beam is chosen such that only one of the fundamental excitonic transitions in each dot is allowed .",
    "each dqd can be then modelled as a four - level system with the basis states @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , corresponding to the ground state ( empty dots ) , an exciton in the second and first qd , and excitons in both qds , respectively .",
