    "recently , the lhcb collaboration has reported on the observation of two hidden - charm pentaquark states in @xmath5 decays , the @xmath6 with a mass of @xmath7 mev and a width of @xmath8 mev and the @xmath0 with a mass of @xmath9 mev and a width of @xmath10 mev  @xcite .",
    "the preferred @xmath11 assignments are of opposite parity .",
    "the best fit yields spin - parity @xmath11 values of @xmath12 , but other possibilities , either @xmath13 or @xmath14 , are also acceptable . the decay branching ratios @xmath15 and @xmath16 have been measured as well  @xcite . in the past decade , many mesonic exotic states have been observed experimentally and many of them clearly contain more than the minimum quark content dictated by the naive quark model , such as the charged @xmath17  @xcite and @xmath18  @xcite states .",
    "the @xmath19 states are the first exotic states observed in the heavy - flavor baryonic sector .",
    "the observation of the @xmath19 states has aroused a lot of interest in the theoretical community .",
    "they have been studied in various frameworks , such as the molecular picture  @xcite , the diquark picture  @xcite , the qcd sum rules  @xcite , and the soliton model  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", questions have been raised regarding whether the observed enhancement could be due to kinematical effects or singularities  @xcite . in a recent publication",
    ", it was suggested that the existence of exotic @xmath20 states can imitate broad bumps in the @xmath21 invariant mass distributions and thus affects the interpretation of the @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "further discussions on the nature of the two @xmath19 states can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one should note that even before the lhcb announcement , the existence of hidden - charm pentaquark states have been explored both in the molecular picture  @xcite and in the quark models  @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery potential of such states has been explored in @xmath22  @xcite and @xmath23  @xcite induced reactions .    it is clear that at this moment , both the experimental and theoretical studies are not yet conclusive .",
    "experimentally , the ambiguities in the spin - parity assignments should be clarified .",
    "theoretically , different interpretations are often not consistent with each other , not only in terms of the dominant fock components of these states but also in terms of the predicted or obtained spin - parities .",
    "the only way to clarify the situation , given the rather large statistics already achieved by lhcb , is to study complementary reactions or decay modes where the @xmath19 states or their counterparts ( predicted by various models ) can be observed .    in refs .",

    "the decays of @xmath27-baryons into a pentaquark state and a pseudoscalar meson have also been examined in the diquark model  @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of either the photoproductions or the decay modes of @xmath27-baryons into all available final states will definitely help us better understand the nature of the pentaquark states .",

    "@xcite , there is good reason to believe that its strange counterparts exist as well",
    ". the hidden - charm pentaquark states with strangeness can decay into @xmath4 .",

    "we observe a prominent structure around 4650 mev on top of the background when the @xmath4 interaction is taken into account .",
    "a variation of @xmath138 shifts the peak position accordingly , but a clear signal can still be observed .",
    "furthermore , as long as the width is smaller than 100 mev , experimental observation should not be too difficult .",
    "we stress however that the strength of the signal will depend strongly on the coupling of the hidden charm state to the @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath122",
    ". a much smaller value of the coupling will diminish the signal as naively expected .",
    "therefore , indeed an experimental study of the decay mode we propose can help to verify or disprove the unitary approach for this particular case .    in fig .",

    "the involved ckm matrix element is the product of @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , as a crude estimate , we would like to guess that the decay rate of the @xmath135 is of the same order of magnitude as that of @xmath142 , neglecting the difference in phase space and final state interactions .",
    "this is somehow consistent with the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is found that @xmath143 , where @xmath144 denotes a pentaquark state having the same light quark composition as that of the proton or @xmath130 , while the first number is for spin 3/2 and that in the parenthesis for spin 5/2 .",
    "therefore , both studies show that the decay mode proposed in the present work should and can be studied at lhcb .",
    "we have proposed to study the @xmath145 decay to measure a hidden - charm pentaquark state with strangeness , predicted to exist in the unitary approach .",
    "this model has predicted the existence of two non - strange hidden - charm pentaquark states in the energy region where the @xmath0 has been seen .",
    "the decay mechanism we employed has been previously adopted to successfully describe the lhcb @xmath5 invariant mass distributions .",
    "our study showed that the strange hidden - charm pentaquark state can be clearly seen on top of the background .",
    "given the fact that both the unitary model and the reaction mechanism have been tested in describing the lhcb @xmath146 decay , we strongly encourage our experimental colleagues to study the @xmath1 decay proposed here , which can be very helpful to test the existence of the pentaquark states and their nature .",
