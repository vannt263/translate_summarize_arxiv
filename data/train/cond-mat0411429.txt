    "one possible explanation for the discrepancy with experimental data is that the linewidth of exciton transitions to @xmath20 is larger than for @xmath18 because of orbital relaxation from @xmath20 to @xmath18 .",
    "we also point out that , for @xmath190 , the restriction of our analysis to only four valence band multiplets ( @xmath61 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath62 ) can no longer be justified rigorously . a calculation taking into account all multiplets in fig .",

    "by contrast , a simple model with broken spherical symmetry reproduces the experimental data at least qualitatively .    for both the trfr signal and the absorption spectrum , the model with broken spherical symmetry yields better agreement with experimental data than the calculations for a spherical qdqw ( fig .",
