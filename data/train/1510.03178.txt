    "virtual charged particle fluctuations in the quantum vacuum give rise to nonlinear , effective couplings between electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "vacuum birefringence in strong electromagnetic fields constitutes one of the most prominent optical signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearity arising within the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "it is so far searched for in experiments using macroscopic magnetic fields @xcite .    an alternative proposal to verify vacuum birefringence with the aid of high - intensity lasers in an all - optical experimental setup has been put forward by @xcite , envisioning the combination of an optical high - intensity laser as pump and a linearly polarized x - ray pulse as probe .",
    "resorting to the locally constant field approximation on the level of the effective lagrangian , recently we have reanalyzed this vacuum birefringence scenario @xcite , rephrasing the phenomenon in terms of a vacuum emission process @xcite .    here",
    ", we adopt the same approach to the case of vacuum birefringence in a stationary , perpendicularly directed , purely magnetic background field extending over a finite spatial extent , and show that we can recover the conventional constant field result .",
    "while this rederivation serves as a simple illustration of our method , we also point out deviations arising beyond infinitely extended constant background fields : apart from vacuum birefringence , probe photons originating at zero field , that are directed towards a magnetic field inhomogeneity can experience the phenomenon of quantum reflection @xcite .",
    "of course , magnetic fields with a finite extent only constitute corresponding magnetic field inhomogeneities .",
    "for other experimental signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearities , we refer to the pertinent reviews about this topical research field @xcite and references therein .",
    "for constant electromagnetic fields , the effective lagrangian encoding quantum corrections to the maxwell lagrangian of classical electrodynamics is a function of the gauge and lorentz invariants of the electromagnetic field @xmath0 and @xmath1 only ; @xmath2 is the dual field strength tensor , with @xmath3 .",
    "our metric convention is @xmath4 , and we use the heaviside - lorentz system with @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , furry s theorem ( charge conjugation symmetry of qed ) demands the effective lagrangian to be even in the number of couplings to the electromagnetic field .",
    "the electron mass @xmath6 is the only other physical energy scale available in qed in constant electromagnetic fields and in the absence of real electrons and photons .",
    "hence , for dimensional reasons , the quantum corrections to the maxwell lagrangian vanishing in the limit @xmath7 are of the following structure , @xmath8 at one - loop level , this lagrangian amounts to the renowned heisenberg - euler effective lagrangian @xcite , whose low - field expansion reads @xmath9+{\\cal o}\\bigl((\\tfrac{e\\epsilon}{m^2})^8\\bigr ) , \\label{eq : l_he}\\ ] ] where we have counted @xmath10 and @xmath11 as @xmath12 .    in inhomogeneous backgrounds additional gauge and lorentz invariant building blocks become available .",
    "for slowly varying fields the deviations from the constant field limit can be accounted for with derivative terms @xmath13 .",
    "if the typical frequency / momentum scale of variation of the inhomogeneous background field is @xmath14 , which can be related to a typical time / length scale of variation @xmath15 via @xmath16 , derivatives effectively translate into multiplications with @xmath14 to be rendered dimensionless by the electron mass @xmath6 . adopting the constant field result   for slowly varying inhomogeneous fields by means of the locally constant field approximation , the deviations from the exact result are of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "employing the locally constant field approximation on the level of the constant - field lagrangian   allows for trustworthy results as long as @xmath18 , i.e. , the typical time / length scales governing the variation of the field inhomogeneity have to be significantly larger than the compton time @xmath19/compton wavelength @xmath20 of the electron ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "hence , this approximation is certainly well justified for the typical field configurations accessible in the laboratory .",
    "here we aim at analyzing vacuum birefringence in terms of a vacuum emission process .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , the single photon emission amplitude from the vacuum subjected to slowly varying electromagnetic fields is given by @xmath23 with the single photon state denoted by @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 denotes the polarization of the emitted photon of four wave - vector @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; the unit wave - vector is @xmath28 .",

    "important constituents of eq .",
    "are the contractions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "because of the antisymmetry of the field strength tensors in the indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 , it suffices to specify just six independent components , which we collect in the following table @xmath39 for further reference .",
    "the above results are very generic and allow for the determination of single photon emission signals from any field profile compatible with the locally constant field approximation .",
    "aiming at the study of vacuum birefringence in terms of a vacuum emission process from a given macroscopic field configuration , the field configuration inducing the outgoing photon signal is the superposition of both the propagating incident probe photon field and the external electromagnetic field `` polarizing '' the quantum vacuum .    here , we exemplarily focus on a linearly polarized plane - wave probe traversing a perpendicularly directed magnetic field .",
    "we assume the direction of the magnetic field to be globally fixed , and to point into @xmath40 direction , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "the probe photons propagate along @xmath42 .",

    "we specialize our calculation to the same effect , as we thereby limit ourselves to a single coupling to the incident probe photon field .",
    "generically , the above expression also accounts for contributions which are of higher - order in the coupling to the probe photon field , corresponding to photon merging effects , resulting in higher - harmonics .",

    "the photons induced in backward direction constitute a quantum reflection signal @xcite , which is a direct consequence of the fact that an external electromagnetic field can be interpreted as constituting an attractive potential in the probe photons equation of motion : probe photons originating from the zero - field region which are directed towards a magnetic field region of finite extent can experience above - barrier reflection @xcite .",
    "considering the same effect in an infinitely extended homogeneous background field , i.e. , without imposing zero - field asymptotics for the incident probe as well as outgoing probe and signal photons , the probe does not sense any variation of the potential and no reflection signal is observed .",
    "note , that we obtained the same functional form for @xmath88 already in @xcite .",
    "however , the approach employed there is not capable of unveiling the asymmetry in the coefficients of the forward and backward signals , and thus results in the same numeric prefactors for both directions : in @xcite we adapted the locally constant field approximation on the level of the photon polarization tensor . due to translational invariance",
    ", the polarization tensor in homogeneous fields does only depend on a single four momentum @xmath89 .",

    "fig : feld ] , which can be straightforwardly fourier transformed to momentum space , @xmath96 .",
    "obviously , this magnetic field profile fulfills @xmath97 , which is completely independent of the additional length scale @xmath98 .",
    "hence , we obtain the same expressions for @xmath99 as if we had naively adapted the homogeneous field result to a finite length interval , i.e. , assumed a constant field amplitude @xmath100 extending over a length @xmath101 .",
    "the second length scale @xmath98 governs the distance over which the field amplitude increases from @xmath102 to @xmath100 , and analogously drops from @xmath100 to @xmath102 .",
    "this becomes most transparent on the level of @xmath103 , by noting that @xmath104 . in order not to leave the range of applicability of the locally constant field approximation",
    ", we have to ensure that @xmath105 . upon insertion of this magnetic field amplitude profile into eqs .  - and choosing @xmath106 , which maximizes the birefringence signal @xmath107 , we obtain @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the induced photon numbers in forward and backward direction , respectively . the result for @xmath110",
    "agrees with the one obtained by the conventional calculation , assuming the probe photons to traverse a constant magnetic field @xmath100 of length @xmath101 : here , the number of probe photons scattered in the perpendicular polarization mode is obtained from the phase shift @xmath111 , with @xmath112 @xcite , as @xmath113 .",
    "note that the numbers of photons induced in backward direction constituting the quantum reflection signal are generically suppressed by an overall factor of @xmath114 in comparison to the numbers of photons induced in forward direction .",
    "in this article we have exemplarily studied vacuum magnetic birefringence as a vacuum emission process . however",
    ", our approach is not limited to the magnetic field case but also applicable to other and more sophisticated field configurations , the only restriction being the limitation to slowly varying electromagnetic fields .",
    "favorably , many field configurations available in the laboratory fall into this class .",
    "insights beyond the locally constant field approximation could , e.g. , be obtained from an _ ab initio _ worldline numeric evaluation of the photon polarization tensor in a given field inhomogeneity @xcite .",
