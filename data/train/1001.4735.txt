    "a graphene bilayer nanoribbons with zigzag edge termination is shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "focussing on the low - energy bands which participate in electronic transport , such ribbons can be modelled by a tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath17 , where each carbon atom hosts one spin - degenerate electronic orbital with annihilation operator @xmath18 .",
    "recent experiments specifically addressed the values of the parameters @xmath19 in bilayer graphene .",
    "@xcite nearest - neighbor hopping in the same graphene layer is described by a hopping element @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "the layers are bernal stacked , with hopping element @xmath22 between dimerised atoms that lie on top of each other .",
    "the symmetry between both layers can be broken by top- or back - gates with a gate voltage @xmath0 , which induce a perpendicular electric field and give rise to an on - site potential @xmath23 on the two layers , which is obtained from @xmath0 by including the screening in the layers .",
    "@xcite we assume that @xmath1 is uniform across the system , even near the boundaries , which in reality will be enforced to a good approximation by the proximity of the metallic gate close to the system . at the boundary ,",
    "we impose standard hard - wall boundary conditions , which amount to setting the wavefunction to zero on lattice sites that lie outside the ribbon .",
    "it is also conventional to include the direct coupling @xmath24 between the non - dimerised atoms in both layers .",
    "@xcite ignoring for the moment other hopping terms , a typical dispersion relation of the edge states in a gated ribbon is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( middle panel ) . of the four bands of edge states , two are massive , with a gap @xmath25 ( the same as for the bulk states ) , while the other two display a linear dispersion , corresponding to two counter - propagating states which are well localized at opposite edges ( see inset ) .",
    "the same scenario is replicated at the other k point in the graphene brillouin zone , but with the edges interchanged .",
    "therefore , each edge supports two counter propagating state , one from each k point .",
    "notably , to this level of approximation , the propagation velocities on both edges are the same .",
    "the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows how the dispersion changes when the two most prominent additional hopping elements are taken into account : the interlayer hopping @xmath26 between adjacent dimerized and non - dimerized carbon atoms , and the intralayer hopping @xmath27 between next - nearest neighbors .",
    "both terms break the particle - hole symmetry , which then discriminates the different edges : the terminating atoms live on different layers and therefore posses a different on - site potential . in the dispersion relation , this takes the effect of an additional background velocity , which increases the velocity at one edge ( the fast edge ) while reducing the velocity at the other edge ( the slow edge ) .",
    "the dependence of these velocities on the gate potential is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    ". the additional hoppings also affect the transverse localization of the edge states .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel in terms of the inverse participation ( ipr ) @xmath28 , which is larger the better localized a state is ( here , the sum is over the transverse direction of the nanoribbon ) .    at this point",
    "it is important to mention that there are two types of zigzag edge termination in graphene bilayer,@xcite the so called @xmath29 and @xmath30 terminations .",
    "when the on site potential @xmath1 is zero some qualitative differences in the bandstructure can be found in both cases .",
    "however when @xmath0 leads to a nonvanishing @xmath1 in both cases two of the edge bands become gapped ( with a gap of the order of @xmath1 ) and the two other bands cross each other around the fermi points as discussed before for the two types of edge terminations . also in both cases the asymmetry between the velocities at different edges can be found , being the differences most prominent at the high energy bands .",
    "thus we will not consider any distinction between the two terminations as long as we are only concerned in the physics at small energies around the fermi points .    at small energies , the hybridization of the edge states leads to an avoided crossing , where the small residual gap @xmath31 vanishes exponentially with increasing width of the ribbon . a sizable hybridization gap @xmath31 exists only for small values of @xmath6 ( narrow ribbons ) .",
    "for typical applied gate voltages and widths , each edge of the nanoribbon therefore behaves like a metallic one - dimensional system with two counter - propagating states , where each state is associated to one of the k points . in this scenario of low dimensionality",
    ", one should expect that interactions play an important role . generally , however , interactions are felt most strongly when particles propagate slowly and are well confined .",
    "thus , the concrete manifestations should depend on the distinct properties of the fast and slow edge states described above .",
    "this is what we will explore in the remainder of this paper .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "within the tight - binding description , interactions can be incorporated via a hubbard term @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the occupation operator on lattice site @xmath39 with electrons of spin @xmath40 .",
    "assuming @xmath41 , each edge can be treated separately via a hamiltonian of non - chiral bosons : @xmath42 where @xmath43 labels the charge ( @xmath44 ) and spin ( @xmath45 ) sectors , while @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the velocity and the luttinger parameters , respectively .",
    "interaction events that do not lead to backscattering renormalize these parameters in different ways , which yields the usual separation between the spin and charge degrees of freedom @xcite : @xmath48 @xmath49 where the upper sign applies to @xmath44 , while the lower sign applies to @xmath45 .",
    "most of the interesting physics arises from backward scattering , which leads to a nonlinear sine - gordon term in the spin sector , @xmath50    at half filling , which we need to consider to assess the size of any interaction - induced gap , this is accompanied by umklapp processes , which contribute an analogous term to the charge sector : @xmath51    all these terms are controlled by the forward and backward coupling constants @xmath52 , which are obtained by writing the hubbard interaction term @xmath53 in the basis @xmath54 of the diagonalized one - particle hamiltonian around each k point ( @xmath9 ) :    @xmath55    the left - right symmetry of the system results in the additional constraint @xmath56 , which involves the ipr of the transverse wavefunction . as seen above , as soon as @xmath32 and @xmath33 are taken into account the ipr strongly depends on the layer - symmetry breaking potential @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the effective strength of interactions can be controlled by the applied gate voltage .",
    "since the terms ( [ sinegordonspin ] ) and ( [ sinegordoncharge ] ) make the hamiltonian not exactly solvable , we assess their consequences using standard renormalization group ( rg ) arguments .",
