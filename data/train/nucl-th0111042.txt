    "there has been much work over the past decade applying the techniques of effective field theory ( eft ) and the renormalization group ( rg ) to low energy nuclear systems such as the nucleon - nucleon force , finite nuclei , and nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "conventional nuclear force models such as the paris , bonn , and argonne potentials incorporate the same asymptotic tail generated by one pion exchange , as the long wavelength structure of the interaction is unambiguously resolved from fits to low energy phase shifts and deuteron properties . the short wavelength part of the interaction is then generated by assuming a specific dynamical model based on heavy meson exchanges , combined with phenomenological treatments at very small distances .",
    "such approaches are necessarily model dependent , as the low energy two - nucleon properties are insufficient to resolve the short distance structure .",
    "such model dependence often appears in many - body calculations , e.g. the coester band in nuclear matter , when highly virtual nucleons probe the short distance structure of the interaction .",
    "the eft approach eliminates the unsatisfactory model dependence of conventional force models and provides an effective description that is consistent with the low energy symmetries of the underlying strong interactions ( qcd ) .",
    "this is accomplished by keeping only nucleons and pions as explicit degrees of freedom , as dictated by the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "all other heavy mesons and nucleon resonances are considered to be integrated out of the theory , their effects contained inside the renormalized pion exchange and scale dependent coupling constants that multiply model independent delta functions and their derivatives  @xcite .",
    "no underlying dynamics are assumed for the heavy mesons and nucleon resonances , as they simply can not be resolved from low energy data .",
    "since rg decimations generate all possible interactions consistent with the symmetries of the underlying theory , it is sufficient to consider all interactions mandated by chiral symmetry and then tune the couplings to the low energy data . power counting arguments are then used to truncate the number of couplings that need to be fit to experiment , thus endowing the eft with predictive power and the ability to estimate errors resulting from the truncation .",
    "moreover , the breakdown of the eft at a given scale signals the presence of new relevant degrees of freedom that must be considered explicitly to properly describe phenomena at that scale .    similar concepts of integrating out the high energy modes have long been used to derive effective interactions in nuclei within a truncated model space , e.g. the sd - shell for the two valence nucleons in @xmath2o .",
    "starting from the vacuum two - body force in the full many - body hilbert space , one can construct an effective theory for the low - lying excitations provided the effective interaction encodes the effects of the integrated high energy modes .",
    "although the traditional model space methods apparently share similarities to the modern rg - eft approaches , these have not been exploited until recently  @xcite and not sufficiently in any realistic nuclear many - body calculation . in the traditional approaches ,",
    "there has been little success in predicting how the effective interaction changes with the model space size . in rg language , no beta functions have been derived that would allow one to calculate an effective interaction in one convenient choice of model space , and then evolve the effective theory to any other scale by following the flow of the beta function .",
    "moreover , one could push the analogy with eft further by projecting the effective interaction onto a few leading operators , with the ability to reliably estimate the errors on calculated nuclear spectra resulting from this truncation .",
    "therefore , it is of greatest interest to address the issue of calculating beta functions within the framework of model space effective interaction methods and to exploit these powerful similarities with the rg - eft approach .",
    "two well known methods for deriving _ energy independent _ model space interactions are the kuo - lee - ratcliff ( klr ) folded diagram theory  @xcite and the related similarity transformation method of lee and suzuki ( ls )  @xcite .",
    "the authors have applied these methods to the nucleon - nucleon problem in vacuum where the model space was taken to be plane wave states with relative momenta @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting unique low momentum potential @xmath0 preserves the deuteron binding energy and the low energy half - on - shell @xmath1 matrix , but with all intermediate state summations cut off at @xmath4  @xcite . in this paper , we restrict our analysis to the two - body problem in free space .",
    "we show that the model space interaction @xmath0 scales with @xmath4 in the same way one would expect from a exact rg treatment of the scattering problem . in this way",
    ", we show that the methods originally used to derive model space interactions in nuclei can be interpreted in modern language as renormalization group decimations , at least for two - body correlations in the nucleus .",
    "this work is a step towards reformulating traditional nuclear many - body methods in a manner consistent with the more systematic and controlled rg - eft approaches . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is a genuinely new result as previous rg studies have dealt with energy dependent effective potentials  @xcite .",
    "it is also the first rg flow study of realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions . from a practical perspective",
    ", it is simpler to use energy independent effective interactions in many - body calculations , as one does not have to recalculate the interaction vertex depending on the energy variable of the propagator it is linked to in a particular diagram .",
    "let us begin with a rg treatment of the scattering problem .",
    "working in a given partial wave we denote the bare ( bonn , paris , argonne , etc . ) two - body potential as @xmath5 , although the following developments are general and apply to any nonrelativistic scattering problem . employing principle value propagators we have the half - on - shell ( hos ) @xmath1 matrix equation  @xcite @xmath6 in a rg treatment of two - body scattering ,",
    "we impose a cutoff @xmath4 on all the loop integrals in the @xmath1 matrix equation and replace the bare @xmath5 with an effective potential @xmath0 .",
    "the effective potential is independent of the scattering energy and is allowed to depend on @xmath4 so that @xmath7 for @xmath8 is preserved .",
    "clearly this is sufficient to ensure that low energy observables , which are fully on - shell quantities are independent of @xmath4 .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath9 by construction , the low momentum hos @xmath1 matrices calculated from eq .",
    "( [ fulltmat ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ lowtmat ] ) are identical .",
    "consequently , the low momentum components of the low energy scattering states are preserved .",
    "we denote the standing wave scattering states of the effective theory by @xmath10 , which can be written in the standard fashion as @xmath11 we therefore take @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ lowtmat ] ) to obtain a flow equation for @xmath0 @xmath13 by writing @xmath14 and using the completeness of the scattering states in the model space  .",
    "therefore , one must use the bi - orthogonal complement @xmath15 in the completeness relation . in the cutoff range of interest ,",

    "writing the interacting green s function in terms of the @xmath1 matrix in the low momentum sector we obtain the exact rg equation @xmath18 the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ gflow],[tflow ] ) is similar to the work of birse _ et al . _",

    "the rg equation of birse _ et al .",
    "_ is exact to second order in @xmath19 .",
    "it reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the scattering energy .",
    "our rg treatment is based on hos @xmath1 matrix preservation , as this is the minimally off - shell quantity needed to preserve the low energy phase shifts as well as the low momentum components of the wave functions , while allowing one to consider an energy independent effective interaction . our exact rg equation for energy independent effective interactions , eq .",
    "( [ tflow ] ) , agrees with the result of birse _ et al . _",
    "@xcite at the one - loop level .",
    "as we shall see below , the starting point of energy independent effective interaction methods is the above off - shell effective potential , and the energy dependence is subsequently traded for momentum dependence .",
    "this procedure is similar to using the equations of motion in many - body physics to trade the energy dependence in favor of a more complicated quasiparticle dispersion relation .",
    "in the previous section , we obtained the rg equation for @xmath22 , eq .",
    "( [ gflow ] ) , from @xmath1 matrix equivalence alone .",
    "we now derive the same equation using the kuo - lee - ratcliff ( klr ) folded diagram technique , originally designed for constructing energy independent model space interactions in shell model applications  @xcite .",
    "first , we define an energy dependent vertex function called the @xmath23 box , that is irreducible with respect to cutting intermediate low momentum propagators .",
    "the @xmath23 box resums the effects of the high momentum modes we wish to integrate out of the theory , @xmath24 it is the same energy dependent effective potential studied by weinberg in the context of chiral lagrangians  @xcite and by birse _",
    "et al . _ for the purpose of an rg treatment of two - body scattering  @xcite . in terms of the @xmath23 box",
    "the hos @xmath1 matrix reads @xmath25 the original literature develops klr folded diagrams using time - ordered perturbation theory for systems with degenerate unperturbed model space spectra . in this framework",
    ", the folded diagrams can be viewed as correction terms one must add , if one factorizes the nested time - integrals one finds in time - ordered perturbation theory for dyson equations . for the present work ,",
    "it is much easier to understand the meaning of folded diagrams in the time - independent framework .",
    "iterating eq .",
    "( [ tqeq ] ) , it is clear that all @xmath23 box vertices are fully off - shell with the exception of the final @xmath23 box in each term .",
    "the folded diagrams are correction terms one must add , if all @xmath23 boxes are evaluated right - side on - shell in the dyson equation . in order to see how this works , the second order @xmath23 box contribution in eq .",
    "( [ tqeq ] ) can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the `` one - fold correction '' and @xmath28 is shorthand for the model space principle value measure . with the expression for @xmath27 , we write the klr folded diagram series for @xmath0 to one - fold , or equivalently to second order in the @xmath23 box as @xmath29 analogously , the two - fold correction to the klr @xmath0 is obtained by considering the @xmath30 contribution of eq .",

    ", \\widehat{q}(p , k;k^{2}).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] proceeding in a similar manner for the higher order terms in the dyson equation , one can write the klr expression for @xmath0 as @xmath32 having motivated the klr folded diagram series , we now derive a flow equation that tells us how the klr @xmath0 changes as one changes the scale @xmath4 .",
    "the first step is to notice that the @xmath23 box , and hence the klr series , obeys the semi - group composition law .",
    "we can therefore perform the decimation to @xmath4 in one step using the bare @xmath5 as input , or equivalently we can integrate out recursively in small steps ; each subsequent step in the decimation uses the @xmath0 of the previous step as input . let us therefore start with the klr @xmath0 at a cutoff @xmath4 , and ask how @xmath0 changes as we integrate out the states lying in the momentum shell @xmath33 . referring to the definition of the @xmath23 box , eq .",
    "( [ qvbare ] ) , it is clear that each intermediate loop integration is @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we have for @xmath35 @xmath36 where the superscript denotes at which step the low momentum potential and the @xmath23 box are evaluated .",
    "although we have given explicit formulas only up to two folds , this will be sufficient to derive the flow equation .",
    "the generalization to all orders in @xmath0 can be found in the appendix , where energy independent effective interactions are related to the spectral representation of the hos @xmath1 matrix .",

    "it does not come as a surprise , as it has been shown diagrammatically that the klr effective theory preserves the low momentum hos @xmath1 matrix of the input bare potential  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have here derived the same flow equation in a manner that makes no reference to @xmath1 matrix preservation .",
    "it may be regarded as an algebraic proof that the folded diagram series preserves the hos @xmath1 matrix .",
    "this firmly establishes that the klr folded diagram theory is equivalent to a rg decimation , at least for the two - nucleon sector .",
    "it is easy to see how the folded diagram series is constructed .",
    "the n - folded diagram is the correction terms one must add , if one evaluates all soft - mode irreducible vertex functions right - side on - shell in the term of @xmath40 of any dyson equation . as we have seen above , the expression for the two - fold contribution is already rather cumbersome .",

    "<S> we show that @xmath0 scales with the cutoff precisely as one expects from renormalization group arguments . </S>",
    "<S> this result is a step towards reformulating traditional model space many - body calculations in the language of effective field theories and the renormalization group . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical scaling properties of @xmath0 are observed to be in excellent agreement with our exact renormalization group equation .    _ </S>",
