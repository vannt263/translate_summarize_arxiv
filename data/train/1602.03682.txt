    "it is a well established fact that matter exists in different states . for strongly interacting matter",
    "at least three states are expected : nuclear matter , hadron gas ( hg ) and a system of deconfined quarks and gluons ( often called the quark - gluon plasma - qgp ) .    one of the most important goals of high - energy heavy - ion collisions is to establish the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter by finding the possible phase boundaries and critical points . in particular , we want to produce the quark - gluon plasma and analyze its properties and the transition between qgp and hg .",
    "this contribution presents experimental results on event - by - event fluctuations of multiplicity , particle type and transverse momentum of charged and identified hadrons produced in inelastic p+p interactions at 20 , 31 , 40 , 80 and 158 gev / c , and centrality selected @xmath1be+@xmath2be collisions at 20@xmath0 , 30@xmath0 , 40@xmath0 , 75@xmath0 and 150@xmath0 gev / c .",
    "the measurements were performed by the multi - purpose na61/shine  @xcite experiment at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) .",
    "they are part of the strong interaction program devoted to study of properties of the onset of deconfinement ( od ) and search for the critical point ( cp ) of strongly interacting matter . within this program",
    "a two dimensional scan in collision energy and size of colliding nuclei is in progress .",
    "the expected signal of a critical point is a non - monotonic dependence of various fluctuation / correlation measures in such a scan .",
    "evidence for the onset of deconfinement at lower sps energies suggests the possibility of detecting the cp in heavy ion collisions . a specific property of the cp - the increase in the correlation length - makes fluctuations its basic signal .",
    "in order to observe the cp , created matter should freeze - out near its location .",
    "so , if at all , the cp signals are expected at energies higher than those of the onset of deconfinement .",
    "indications of enlarged event - by - event fluctuations in multiplicity and transverse momentum as well as an intermittency signal were found by na49 in si+si collisions at 158@xmath0 gev  @xcite .",
    "when comparing fluctuations in systems of different size ( volume ) one should use quantities which are insensitive to volume and volume fluctuations ( unavoidable in a+a collisions ) .",
    "two families of such quantities were used .",
    "first , the intensive quantity scaled variance , @xmath3 = \\frac{\\langle a^{2}\\rangle-\\langle a\\rangle^{2}}{\\langle a \\rangle}$ ] where @xmath0 stands for an event quantity . in the grand canonical ensemble",
    "it is independent of volume but it depends on volume fluctuations .",

    "thus they can be sensitive to various physics effects in different ways . with the proper normalization they are dimensionless and have a common scale",
    "they are 0 for absence of e - b - e fluctuations ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and one for the independent particle production model . here",
    "a and b stand for multiplicities of different particle types or multiplicity and sum of transverse momenta . for comparison with the na49 experiment also the @xmath11 quantity was used . for fluctuations of @xmath12",
    "it reads @xmath13 } \\big [ \\sqrt{\\sigma[p_{t},n]}-1 \\big]$ ] . for particle type fluctuations of two particle types @xmath14 and @xmath15 it is defined as @xmath16}-1]$ ] .",
    "enhanced fluctuations of multiplicity and transverse momentum were suggested as a possible signature of the cp of strongly interacting matter  @xcite .",
