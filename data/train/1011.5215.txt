    "after stone @xcite and zhegalkin @xcite , boole s main contribution to science @xcite can be understood as the realization that the mathematics of logical phenomena is controlled  to a large extend  by the field @xmath0 with two elements ; in contrast the mathematics of classical physical phenomena is controlled  to a large extend  by the field @xmath1 of real numbers .",
    "the switch from @xmath2 to @xmath1 corresponds with a deep ontological jump from logical to physical phenomena .",
    "the switch from @xmath1 to @xmath3 corresponds to the jump from classical to quantum physics . +",
    "what makes the logic / physics jump possible is the fact that @xmath2 may be regarded as an object of two different categories . on the one hand , it is a field @xmath4 with sum and product defined by making @xmath5 the neutral element and @xmath6 the product unit . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a set of truth values with @xmath5 and @xmath6 representing falsity and truth , respectively .",
    "indeed , @xmath7 is a boolean algebra : a complemented distributive lattice with minimum @xmath5 and maximum @xmath6 .",
    "the operations @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond with the logical connectives @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the two viewpoints are related by the identities : @xmath13 these identities , together with the inverse relation @xmath14 , allow us to switch back and forth from the algebraic to the logical viewpoint .",
    "+ by and large , the logical and algebraic viewpoints have remained separated . in this work , in order to explore quantum - like phenomena in characteristic @xmath15 , we place ourselves at the jump .",
    "our algebraic viewpoint is , in a sense , complementary to the quantum logic approach initiated by birkhoff and von neumann @xcite .",
    "for example , while the meet in quantum logic is a commutative connective , our quantum analogue for the meet turns out to be non - commutative .",
    "the appearance of non - commutative operations is a common tread in quantum physics @xcite . + we take as our guide the well - known fact that the quantization of canonical phase space may be identified with the algebra of differential operators on configuration space . in analogy with the real / complex case , we introduce @xmath16 the algebra of boolean differential operators on @xmath17 we provide a couple of presentations by generators and relations of @xmath16 , giving rise to the boole - weyl algebras @xmath18 and the shifted boole - weyl algebras @xmath19 .",
    "we call these algebras the quantum boolean algebras .",
    "we study the structural coefficients of @xmath18 and @xmath19 in various bases .",
    "+ having introduced the quantum boolean algebras , we proceed to study them from the logical and set theoretical viewpoints . for us ,",
    "the main difference between classical and quantum logic is that classical observations , propositions , can be measured without , in principle , modifying the state of the system ; quantum observations , in contrast , are quantum operators : the measuring process changes the state of the system .",
    "indeed , regardless of the actual state of the system , after measurement the system will be in an eigenstate of the observable .",
    "quantum observables are operators acting on the states of the system , and thus quite different to classical observables which are descriptions of the state of the system . + this work is organized as follows . in section [ s1 ]",
    "we review some elementary facts on regular functions on affine spaces over @xmath2 . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we introduce @xmath16 the algebra of boolean differential operators on @xmath20 . in section [ bwa ]",
    "we introduce the boole - weyl algebra @xmath18 which is a presentation by generators and relations of @xmath16 .",
    "we describe the structural coefficients of @xmath18 in several bases . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we introduce the shifted boole - weyl algebra @xmath19 which is another presentation by generators and relations of @xmath16 .",
    "we describe the structural coefficients of @xmath19 in several bases . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we discuss the logical aspects of our constructions .",
    "we propose a quantum operational calculus for which boolean differential operators play the same role that truth functions play in the classical propositional calculus . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we adopt a set theoretical viewpoint ; we show that just as the classical propositional calculus is intimately related with @xmath21 , the algebra of sets of subsets of @xmath22 , the quantum operational calculus is intimately related with @xmath23 the algebra of sets of subsets of two disjoint copies of @xmath22 . in section [ s7 ] we make some closing remarks and mention a few topics for future research .",
