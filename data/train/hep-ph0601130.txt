    "since phase transitions take place in a finite time , causality guarantees that correlation lengths remain finite .",
    "if the symmetry breaking permits non - trivial homotopy groups the frustration of the order parameter fields is resolved by the creation of topological defects to mediate between the different ground states . since defects are , in principle , observable , they provide an excellent experimental tool for determining how transitions occur .",
    "zurek@xcite and kibble@xcite originally suggested that causality alone is sufficient to bound the initial density of defects arising in a continuous transition , whether in condensed matter or quantum field theory .",
    "the analysis is very general , and depends on the fact that there is a maximum speed ( e.g. the speed of light or the speed of sound ) at which the system can become ordered .",
    "the zk causal arguments can be quantified in many variants , and we will not rehearse them here .",
    "it is sufficient to consider a system with critical temperature @xmath2 , cooled through that temperature at a rate @xmath3 thereby defining the quench time @xmath4 .",
    "the prediction is that , if @xmath5 is the defect separation at the time of defect formation , then @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the relaxation time for short wavelength modes and @xmath8 , also determined from the microscopic details of the system , characterises the size of cold defects .",
    "the coefficient @xmath9 is an undetermined efficiency factor , taken to be @xmath10 , but anticipated to be greater than unity .    we term @xmath11 the zurek - kibble ( zk ) characteristic index .",
    "its mean - field values are typically @xmath12 for relativistic systems and @xmath13 for strongly damped non - relativistic systems .",
    "experiments on a range of condensed matter systems ( superfluid @xmath0 @xcite , high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite , josephson tunnel junctions ( jtjs ) @xcite ) give results that are commensurate with ( [ xibar ] ) .",
    "this may seem paradoxical in that subsequent analytic approximations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite have shown that , for simple systems , the scaling behaviour of ( [ xibar ] ) is understood , not so much in terms of causal bounds , but in terms of the instabilities of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) theory , whose dissipative behaviour controls which regime we are in . however , where scaling is appropriate it is found that causality arguments identify the correct engineering dimensions for the scaling behaviour of defect densities @xcite and ( [ xibar ] ) survives @xcite .    for symmetry breaking of local gauge theories the result ( [ xibar ] ) is not complete because of the freezing in of long wavelength modes of the gauge fields @xcite .",
    "however , for the high-@xmath1 experiments of @xcite and the jtjs of @xcite ) the effect of this additional mechanism is small and we shall ignore it , given that it does not occur for the simple model that we shall solve numerically later .    for each of the condensed matter systems listed above the relevant topological defects are vortex lines ( strings ) .",
    "again , in the context of the early universe , strings ( cosmic strings ) are the almost inevitable consequence of symmetry breaking in the most obvious extensions of the standard model for electroweak unification @xcite .",
    "observation has suggested the possible existence of cosmic strings @xcite but , as yet , the evidence is not compelling .",
    "most simply , for both condensed matter and the early universe , the most studied and best understood strings arise from the breaking of a global or local @xmath14 symmetry , in which the order parameter can be represented by a single complex scalar field . in such cases the structure of the vortex is quite simple , with a trivial core , in the centre of which the order parameter vanishes , restoring the @xmath14 symmetry there .",
    "that is , a string is a simple tube of false vacuum or ground - state , trapping flux if the symmetry is local .",
    "although this is appropriate for the phases of the condensed matter systems for which experiments have been performed , it is a simplification since both superfluid @xmath0 and high-@xmath1 superconductors have order parameters @xmath15 with several components . the unstable ground state ( false vacuum ) corresponds to @xmath16 .",
    "we can separate the components of @xmath15 into two types @xmath17 so that , in bulk , the @xmath18 fields condense ( i.e. are non - zero ) , whereas the @xmath19 fields do not . for any defect this characterises the situation in its exterior and , for a normal defect , _ both _ @xmath18 and @xmath19 are zero in the core .",
    "however , in some parts of parameter space it may require less energy to produce defects with abnormal cores , in which @xmath20 , but the @xmath21 .",
    "the existence of defects inside which the @xmath19 fields condense is not a question of topology , merely one of energetics .",
    "this is the case for superfluid @xmath22 with its nine complex order parameters , for which there is experimental evidence for superfluid @xmath22 vortices with ferromagnetic @xmath23 cores@xcite .",
    "also , this phenomenon has been predicted to occur in the idealised so(5 ) model @xcite of high - temperature superconductivity , where , for appropriate doping , the cores of the conventional abrikosov vortices are antiferromagnetic .",
    "there has been recent experimental evidence to support this theoretical picture@xcite .",
    "this is not just a phenomenon of condensed matter physics .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that such strings also occur in the so - called colour superconducting phase of qcd , that is believed to be realized when the baryon density is a few times larger than nuclear density @xcite , and hence in neutron stars .",
    "in fact , that such a phenomenon can occur in relativistic systems was first discussed by witten @xcite on looking at generalisations of cosmic strings .",
    "his model is the simplest of all that is compatible with early universe cosmology : consider a two component system described by two complex scalar fields @xmath24 with an approximate @xmath25 symmetry .",
    "if the @xmath25 symmetry between fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 is explicitly broken down to @xmath28 , the @xmath26 condensation might be energetically more favorable than @xmath27 condensation , and the ground state will be given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "as intimated above , this system permits @xmath26 vortices characterized by the phase of @xmath26 field varying by an integer multiple of @xmath31 as one traverses a contour around the vortex core .",
    "witten showed that , if the approximate @xmath25 symmetry is broken only weakly , the @xmath27 field may condense inside the core of the @xmath26 string , breaking the corresponding @xmath14 symmetry in the core .",
    "one consequence of this core - condensation is that @xcite it provides a way to stabilize a string loop against shrinking , as would normally be the case because of the string tension .",
    "the condensed matter counterpart to witten s model of approximate @xmath25 symmetry breaking is in two - component becs @xcite , for which both core condensation and this stabilisation may already have been seen .",
    "most of the work cited above has addressed the static properties of defects with core condensation . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of the creation of such defects .",
    "insofar as the scaling behaviour of ( [ xibar ] ) is truly a consequence of causality we would expect it to be equally true for defects with and without core condensation .",
    "however , it may not be so simple in that one consequence of core condensation is that the interactions between vortices can be drastically altered by the presence of non - trivial cores @xcite . in the following sections we shall consider the simplest model permitting core condensation , to check whether the formation accords with the simple kibble - zurek scaling laws in @xmath32 of ( [ xibar ] ) .",
    "our model is a simplified version of more realistic dissipative systems , such as the ginzburg - landau description @xcite of high-@xmath1 superconductors . however , with the early universe in mind we extend it to a relativistic underdamped model when appropriate .",
    "specifically , let us consider the symmetry breaking @xmath34 in one dimension , where @xmath35 denotes explicit symmetry breaking by the introduction of terms in the action and @xmath36 denotes spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "we consider a free energy of the form @xmath37 + v(\\phi,{\\eta } ) \\bigg ] , \\label{f(1,1 ) } \\label{eq : seven}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 for which we have chosen to implement the phase transition explicitly through the landau form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "the fact that there is no true transition in one dimension is irrelevant for the rapid changes in temperature that we shall consider @xcite .    when @xmath41 @xmath42 possesses @xmath43 symmetry , and we can take @xmath26 and @xmath27 to be the real and imaginary parts of a complex field @xmath44 .",
    "there is a minor complication in that , if we fix the phase of @xmath44 to be zero , say , at infinity , making space @xmath45 , the winding number of the phase is a conserved charge .",
    "however , the configurations with non - zero charge are skyrmions , and not the defects of relevance to the zk scenario , of which none exist in the absence of topological charge when there are no fixed boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath43 is broken explicitly to @xmath46 when @xmath47 , which will be the case of interest for defect formation . in 1d ,",
    "the defects are kinks .",
    "for example , to convert @xmath42 of ( [ f(1,1 ) ] ) into an @xmath48 model for high-@xmath1 along the lines of @xcite we elevate @xmath26 into the two - component complex field that couples to the electromagnetic field , and elevate @xmath27 to the three - component nel vector of antiferromagnetism .",
    "a similar transmutation would recreate a model like witten s . in this regard",
    ", we note that the potentials presented in the literature are not quite identical in the way the different sectors couple .",
    "they only become so on imposing non - linear constraints ( e.g. @xmath49 ) , as in @xcite . at an effective level",
    "this can make little difference to the statics of defects ( e.g. @xcite ) , but for the dynamics we revert to the more fundamental linear sigma model of ( [ f(1,1 ) ] ) , modelled on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "phase - transitions leading to kinks and walls with core condensation and displaying repulsive interactions were considered in the context of a @xmath50 theory in @xcite . in that case",
    "the authors were concerned mostly with the long - time behaviour of the system after the transition .",
    "in particular , significant changes to the scaling beaviour of domain wall networks were observed as well as the formation of defect lattices as the final product of the evolution .",
    "here we will concentrate on the period straight after the transition , namely on the process of defect formation , rather than on the long - time dynamics .",
    "the properties of the translation invariant configurations that minimize the free - energy above depend on the value of @xmath51 . defining @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "we have that , for @xmath54 , @xmath55>f\\left[0,\\eta_{0}\\right ] , \\qquad \\beta > 1\\label{eq : eight}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] corresponding to an ground state with @xmath56 .    for @xmath57",

    "( [ eq : eight ] ) holds again , as @xmath51 is now negative and @xmath27 is therefore constrained to be zero .",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath57 regime and consider kink - like solutions that minimize the action in eq .",
    "( [ eq : seven ] ) for the set of boundary conditions @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for any value of @xmath51 in this region",
    "the free - energy is always stationary for the straightforward kink solution obtained by setting @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the kink size .",
    "the free - energy of this configuration is @xmath51 independent and given by @xmath65    it is possible that for certain values of @xmath51 other stable configurations exist with a lower free - energy @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , for this particular system , we were able to find such solutions analytically .",
    "any static solution obeys the time - independent equations of motion derived from the free - energy eq .",
    "( [ eq : seven ] ) : @xmath66 we start by assuming that @xmath67 has the usual kink - profile @xmath68 where @xmath69 , the size of the core can now depend on @xmath51 .",
    "the trivial kink profile with @xmath70 and @xmath71 is obviously a solution for all values of @xmath51 . in order to find other possible solutions , we assume @xmath72 and replace the general kink profile ( with arbitrary core size @xmath69 ) into the equation for @xmath26 , eq .",

    "the difference lies in the fact that the bec condensate obeys non - dissipative gross - pitaevskii equations , rather than the ( relativistic ) dissipative tdgl equation appropriate to condensed matter and the early universe .",

    "the problem we want to address here is to determine what happens when a kink and an anti - kink are put in the vicinity of each other . for the trivial profiles corresponding to @xmath101",
    ", it is well known that a kink and anti - kink attract each other with a force that decreases exponentially with the separation of the cores . in a setting where kinks and anti - kinks form as a consequence of a phase - transition ,",
    "this allows for pair annihilation processes . in our case , because of the presence of the extra field , kinks can have two distinct charges and it is reasonable to expect these to play a role in their interaction . if we imagine a kink / anti - kink pair with the same charge in the limit @xmath102 , the result is a configuration close to a `` springy '' @xmath14 winding . the @xmath14 spring will tend naturally to `` stretch '' itself , corresponding , in terms of the kink / anti - kink pair , to a repulsive interaction .",
    "the opposite reasoning suggests that kinks and anti - kinks with symmetric charges should attract each other .    in order to check this scenario and obtain effective interaction potentials we followed the gradient flow approximation @xcite",

    "[ attraction ] and [ repulsion ] we show @xmath111 for several values of @xmath51 , for pairs with opposite and identical charges respectively .",
    "as expected , the force between opposite charged kinks and anti - kinks is always attractive . as @xmath51 increases and the kinks become less localized , the steepness of the potential decreases indicating a weakening of the interaction force .",
    "a kink / anti - kink pair with identical charges displays , on the contrary , a repulsive interaction for distances above a certain threshold . for smaller distances",
    "the interaction seems to be always attractive , though results below the core size , @xmath112 , should not be trusted as the `` moduli '' becomes ill - defined .",
    "as @xmath51 increases , the height of the potential maximum becomes larger and its location moves towards smaller values of @xmath110 .",
    "though for values of @xmath51 just above the @xmath113 threshold the size of the potential barrier is likely to have negligible effects , as @xmath84 the kinetic energy needed to surpass the barrier will become increasingly high . as a consequence of the repulsive nature of their interaction , same - charge kinks may be prevented from colliding and we can expect a regime where pair annihilation will be suppressed .",
    "as we will see , this will lead to qualitative changes in defect production in a typical phase transition .",
    "we now proceed to numerically evaluate the formation of these various types of defects by using a langevin equation to simulate a series of quenched transitions . our main goal will be to check whether the types of scaling predicted by the kibble - zurek scenario in ( [ xibar ] ) are compatible with the presence of non - trivial defects as described in the previous section .",

    "a simpler version of this model with one single field has been used successfully in several studies of defect formation in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite ; we refer the reader to these for more a detailed discussion of the model and its numerical implementation .",

    "one should note that the method used to determine the final defect density is known to lead to a slight over - estimate in @xmath128 when compared to other , computationally more demanding , approaches ( for a discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the deviation from the theoretical prediction @xmath141 for the over - damped regime . with this caveat in mind , and remembering that the transition between the under and over - damped regimes is continuous",
    ", we will proceed as in @xcite and use the value @xmath142 to distinguish between the two types of behaviour . in the following , all values of @xmath128",
    "should be taken in reference to those obtained in the low-@xmath51 parameter region . as is clear in fig .",

    "the initial period of slow decrease in @xmath128 for values of @xmath51 up to @xmath146 can be related to the fact that the effective physical consequences of the dissipation should be measured in terms of the relevant masses of the problem .",
    "the relaxation time scale that determines the type of behaviour ( dissipative _ vs _ relativistic ) is given by the inverse of @xmath147 , where @xmath148 stands for the lowest mass in the theory .",
    "as @xmath51 increases and @xmath149 , the mass of one of the excitations of the vacuum approaches zero . when @xmath150 and the original lagrangian becomes explicitly @xmath14 symmetric , this degree of freedom corresponds to the massless goldstone boson .",
    "more specifically , the masses of the vacuum excitations for the potential in eq .  (",
    "[ potential ] ) are given by @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "clearly , @xmath153 takes increasingly small values as @xmath51 approaches @xmath105 .",
    "this leads to a rise in the largest effective dissipation scale @xmath154 , shifting the system towards the over - damped limit and decreasing the value of @xmath128 .",
    "in order to check this we simulated a one field relativistic system with a varying mass term .",
    "we observed as expected , that as the mass was reduced the value of @xmath128 decreased , with the system displaying dissipative effects .",
    "how is this trend towards lower values of the scaling exponent stopped ? to understand the overall behaviour of @xmath128 as displayed is fig .",
    "[ results ] one must keep in mind that as @xmath51 takes larger values , the interaction between kinks and anti - kinks changes considerably . as discussed in section",
    "[ interaction ] , for large separations , there is a repulsive interaction between kinks and anti - kinks with the same charge .",
    "note that the effect of the repulsive interaction should not be felt immediately after @xmath155 , as the height of the potential barrier is initially very small . nevertheless ,",
    "since the energy needed to overcome the repulsive barrier increases with @xmath51 , we expect kink / anti - kink annihilation to be inhibited for larger values of this parameter .",
    "this should lead to survival of a larger number of kink pairs , increasing the final number of defects .",
    "what would be the signature of this mechanism in the scaling of the final defect density with quench rate ? clearly the effect would be felt more strongly for fast quenches , where defect densities are higher and annihilation is likely to play a bigger role .",
    "an increase in kink survival rates for low values of @xmath32 should lead to a steeper distribution @xmath124 , that is , larger values of the exponent @xmath128 .",
    "the mechanism above provides an explanation to why the decrease in @xmath128 is halted for values of @xmath51 roughly halfway between @xmath156 and @xmath157 . in order to confirm this scenario we identified neighbouring pairs of kinks and anti - kinks in the simulation and determined their charges by looking at the sign of @xmath27 in their cores . using the knowledge of the spatial distribution of charges at the final time of each simulation",
    ", we counted the number of defect pairs with equal and opposite charge respectively .",
    "if same - charge pairs are being prevented from annihilating , then their numbers should be in excess of those of opposite charged pairs . in fig .",

    "the results match our expectations well , with the fraction of pairs with equal charge deviating little from @xmath156 up to values of @xmath158 . above that threshold",
    "there is a decrease in the percentage of pairs with attracting charges , signaling the survival of equal charge pairs due to the rise in the repulsive potential barrier .",
    "we also confirmed that this effect is more marked for fast quenches , as discussed above . for reference ,",
    "the plots include the data of the fraction of pairs with negative charge as well .",
    "as expected , as a consequence of the symmetry of the theory , this quantity remains equal to @xmath156 within error - bars throughout the whole range of @xmath51 .",
    "finally we will focus on the apparently anomalous behaviour of the system for values of @xmath51 very near @xmath105 , in which limit there is no topological charge .",
    "for the three points with highest @xmath51 , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath159 , there is a marked increase in the exponent @xmath128 , accompanied by a decrease in the fraction of same - charge pairs",
    ". a closer look at the data reveals that the change in relative amount of types of kink / anti - kink pairs is caused exclusively by the number of pairs with opposite charge going up by a considerable amount .",
    "we note that the results for these three values of @xmath51 should be taken with care since we are in a regime where the kink core size becomes increasingly large .",
    "in particular , for fast quenches with high final defect densities , the defect - defect separation becomes of the order of magnitude of the core size .",
    "taking the most extreme case @xmath160 , we find for the simulation parameters @xmath161 , which implies that each defect has a spatial extension of the order of @xmath162 .",
    "our simulation box should in principle not be able to accommodate more than @xmath163 of these kinks , and for fast quenches the number observed is indeed very close ( for example @xmath164 in the relativistic case , for the smallest @xmath32 ) . in other words ,",
    "the correlation length leading to domain formation at the transition is close to the core kink size .",
    "these cases should be understood as being effectively in the @xmath14 regime , with winding springs being formed with no spatially localized core .",
    "the dynamics of these objects should be described in terms of unwinding processes and this might lead to a slower annihilation rate than traditional kink / anti - kink collisions . in terms of the interaction potentials in fig .",
    "[ attraction ] this corresponds to the flattening of the attraction potential as @xmath84 .",
    "a study of the time - scales involved in the departure from equilibrium in such case ( using for example the techniques developed in @xcite ) could also shed some light on the dynamics of these systems .",
    "a detailed analysis of the unwinding process and its role in defect production in a phase - transition will be the focus of a future publication dedicated exclusively to the @xmath14 theory in @xmath165 dimensions @xcite .",
    "we studied kink formation in 1 + 1 dimensions , in a scalar theory where an added field can lead to condensation in the defect core .",
    "we obtained explicit expressions for the non - trivial defect profiles , and determined the region of parameter space for which these are stable .",
    "this introduces an extra degree of complexity in the theory as kinks acquire a charge defined in terms of the sign of the core condensate . as a consequence ,",
    "the process of defect production at a non - equilibrium phase transition suffers a qualitative change , with annihilation of kinks and anti - kinks being suppressed due to the repulsive nature of their interaction .",
    "the degree to which this takes place depends on the parameters of the potential . as a consequence we observed deviations from traditional kibble - zurek scaling , with the value of the scaling parameter showing a clear , measurable signature of this effect .",
    "these results open interesting possibilities for the case of higher dimensional theories .",
    "though there seems to be good evidence by now in favour of the stability of vortons in @xmath166 theories in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite , the question of formation still remains unresolved .",
    "vortons are very fragile objects making a numerical study of their production in a phase - transition impossible , the size of the domains required being severely constrained by computational limitations . the model described in this article",
    "can be generalized to 2 + 1 dimensions and an extra condensate field introduced .",
    "such @xmath167 theory would display domain walls formed by kinks of the @xmath168 field , with the @xmath14 field condensing in their cores and leading to vorton - like solutions .",
    "the lower space - time dimensionality of this model could be make numerical simulations of vorton formation possible - a line of research we will be following in a future publication .",
