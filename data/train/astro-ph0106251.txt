    "dark matter ( dm ) halos in the cold dark matter scenario are formed via dissipationless hierarchical merging and harbor the infall / cooling of the primordial gas that leads to the formation of the present  day galaxies .",
    "several studies have investigated the detailed structure of these halos by means of @xmath1-body simulations at a progressively higher spatial / mass resolution ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the outcome is well known : cdm halos have an  universal \" profile in their density which includes a steep central cusp . in detail , on galactic scales @xmath2 kpc : @xmath3 .",
    "simulations at the highest resolution indicate @xmath4 @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "let us represent generic halos , including the cdm ones , by means of : @xmath5 \\   [ 1+(r / r_s)^{\\alpha } ] ^{(\\delta-\\gamma)/\\alpha}}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the density inner slope , @xmath7 is the outer slope and @xmath8 settles the turnover point between the inner and outer regimes .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 indicates the presence of a  constant density \" ( inner ) region ( cdr ) . if @xmath10 , as in collisionless cdm , the density diverges for @xmath11 . in the case of @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the size of the cdr , whose value is @xmath14 .",
    "according to the above notation , the moore density profile corresponds to ( @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath6)= ( 0 , 1.5 , 3 , 1.5 ) and the burkert ",
    "salucci one to ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 ) @xcite .",
    "we test these mass models by means of the dark halos detected around galaxies of a sample of low luminosity late  type spirals . in these objects",
    "the dm distribution can be easily derived from the available high - quality _ optical _ rotation curves because the stellar and hi disks contribute very little to the gravitational potential so as the beam smearing effect , plaguing the hi rc s , is obviously absent .",
    "the sample includes 9 high  quality _ optical _ rc s that are smooth and symmetric and extend at least out to the optical edge @xmath15 .",
    "the characteristics of merit are the following : the spatial resolution is better than @xmath16 and the velocity _ rms _ is @xmath17 .",
    "the mass modeling is furthermore simplified in that in these spirals the gas contribution to @xmath18 ( for @xmath19 ) is modest @xcite and the stellar surface brightness is very well fit by a freeman disk .",
    "the mass model includes _",
    "i ) _ a stellar exponential thin disk with free parameter @xmath20 i.e. the fractional disk contribution to the total circular velocity at @xmath21 , and _",
    "ii ) _ a dark spherical halo , whose contribution to @xmath18 is obtained from ( 1 ) in that : @xmath22 . once we choose the scenario ( i.e. @xmath12 or @xmath23 ) , we are left with two free parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath13 , the characteristic density and radius .",
    "both get determined by adjusting the model to data as in @xcite .",
    "the cdm halo profiles fail : in no case they can reproduce ( with or without an exponential disk ) the observed rc s .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "1 : the discrepancy with data is very high at any radius . the cdm halos , even allowed to take any value for @xmath13 ( or for the concentration parameter ) , have definitely a too steep density profile in the innermost region and show a too flat profile in the outer regions .",
    "next , we fit the bs profile to the data : the results are shown in fig . 1 and table 1 .",
    "this model fits perfectly , indicating the values of parameters which are reported in table 1 .",
    "each of 9 halos has a central density @xmath14 of about @xmath24 g/@xmath25 that keeps constant out the edge of the stellar distribution .",
    "we definitely conclude , as in @xcite , that the dark halos embedding the stellar disks show a density distribution inconsistent with that predicted by cdm ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "real halos in the universe rather resemble , in the regions where the stars reside , some homogeneous spheres .",
    "crucially , the sample and the method employed here level off to zero the criticisms raised to previous claims for dm core radii in galaxies . furthermore , since the dm radial distribution out to @xmath15 is featureless , we can not link together the local and the global properties of the dark halos ; such a connection , which is a main consequence of the bottom  up merging scenario appears to be just missing in nature .",
    "the cdm scenario , then , must find a way to cut off any signature of the gravitational collisionless collapse .",
    "for instance , the  temperature \" of the cdm particles , which initially @xmath26 for @xmath27 , must be largely heated up and kept constant out to the disk edge ( see @xcite ) .",
    "solving this deep mystery will be the guideline of our ( and others ) future research ."
