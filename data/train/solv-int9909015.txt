    "the modern theory of integrable partial differential equations is closely related to the xix century differential geometry as presented in monographs of bianchi and darboux  @xcite . in that classical period",
    "many geometers studied `` interesting '' classes of surfaces . a remarkable property of these surfaces ( or more appropriate : coordinate systems on surfaces and submanifolds ) is that they allow for transformations , which exhibit the so called _",
    "permutability property_. such transformations called , depending on the context , the darboux , bianchi , bcklund , laplace , moutard , combescure , lvy , ribaucour or fundamental transformations of jonas , can be also described in terms of certain families of lines called line congruences  @xcite .    to give an example , the angle between the asymptotic directions on the pseudospherical surfaces in @xmath0 , when written as a function of the asymptotic coordinates satisfies the sine - gordon equation .",
    "from this point of view the study of pseudospherical surfaces is , roughly speaking , equivalent to studying of the sine - gordon equation and its solutions .",
    "the transformations of pseudospherical surfaces , introduced by bianchi and bcklund , lead to the celebrated bcklund transformations of the sine - gordon equation .    at the end of xix - th century",
    "it was also discovered that most of the `` interesting '' submanifolds are provided by reductions of conjugate nets ( see section  [ sec : conj - nets ] ) , and the transformations between such submanifolds are the corresponding reductions of the fundamental ( or jonas ) transformations of conjugate nets .",
    "it is worth of mentioning that from the point of view of integrable systems the conjugate nets and their iso - conjugate deformations and transformations are described by the so called multicomponent kadomtsev  petviashvilii hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "apparently , asymptotic nets seem not to be directly related to conjugate nets .",
    "however , there exists an approach to asymptotic nets and their transformations ( w  congruences ) describing them as conjugate nets within the line geometry of plcker ; see sections  [ sec : line - geometry ] and [ sec : ass - nets ] for more details .    in the soliton theory",
    "the discrete integrable systems are considered more fundamental then the corresponding differential systems @xcite .",
    "discrete equations include the continuous theory as the result of a limiting procedure , moreover different limits can give from one discrete equation variuous differential ones .",
    "furthermore , discrete equations reveal some symmetries lost in the continuous limit .    during last few years",
    "the connection between geometry and integrability has been observed also at a discrete level .",
    "it turns out that the discrete analogs of pseudospherical surfaces were studied long time ago by sauer ; see  @xcite and references therein . in connection with the hirota discrete analog of the sine - gordon equation",
    "@xcite these `` discrete pseudospherical surfaces '' were investigated by bobenko and pinkall  @xcite . in the book of sauer  @xcite",
    "one can find also other examples of discrete surfaces , or better @xmath1 lattices in @xmath2 ; in particular , he defined _ discrete asymptotic nets _ and _ discrete conjugate nets _",
    "( consult also sections  [ sec : conj - nets ] and  [ sec : da ] ) .",
    "these definitions , not only have clear geometric meaning , but also provide the proper , from the point of view of integrability , discretizations of asymptotic and conjugate nets on surfaces .",
    "the importance of discrete conjugate nets in integrability theory was recognized in  @xcite , where it was demonstrated that ( the discrete analog of ) the laplace sequence of such lattices provides geometric interpretation of hirota s discretization of the two dimensional toda system  @xcite  one of the most important equations of the soliton theory and its applications . soon after that doliwa and santini defined and studied  @xcite the discrete analogs of multidimensional conjugate nets ( multidimensional quadrilateral lattices ) .",
    "they also found that the corresponding equations were already known in the literature , being obtained by bogdanov and konopelchenko  @xcite from the @xmath3 approach .",
    "the darboux - type transformations of the quadrilateral lattices have been found by maas , doliwa and santini  @xcite .",
    "the same authors also investigated in detail the geometry of these transformations  @xcite ; in order to do that the theory of discrete congruences has been constructed as well .    in recent literature",
    "one can find various examples of integrable discrete geometries ( see , for example ,  @xcite and articles in  @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that all the known , up to now , integrable lattices are special cases of asymptotic or quadrilateral lattices . for example , discrete pseudospherical surfaces investigated by bobenko and pinkall  @xcite and discrete affine spheres considered by bobenko and schief  @xcite are asymptotic lattices subjected to additional constraints .    given a physical system described by integrable partial differential equations , then one of first steps towards quantizing the model is to find its discrete version preserving the integrability properties ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it turns out that often ( see , for example , discussion in @xcite ) information coming from the quantum model arises naturally as a result of the solution of the classical discrete integrable equations .",
    "some recent attempts to quantize the theory of gravity use approach of fluctuating geometries ( see recent reviews @xcite ) based on the concept of discrete manifolds .",
    "however most of the research in this direction is done by computer simulations , therefore examples of lattice geometries described by integrable equations may be of some help in developing this program .",
    "such integrable lattice geometries could be then studied using powerful tools of the soliton theory , such like the ( quantum ) inverse spectral transform , algebro - geometric methods of integration , etc .",
    "the connection of asymptotic nets with stationary axially symmetric solutions of the einstein equations @xcite is well known in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "recently there was discovered by schief @xcite an intriguing link between self - dual einstein spaces @xcite and discrete affine spheres , which form an integrable subcase of discrete asymptotic nets .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to study integrability of general asymptotic lattices .",
    "the main results of this paper are contained theorems  [ th : d - a ] and [ th : d - w ] , which incorporate the theory of asymptotic lattices and their transformations into the theory of quadrilateral lattices .",
    "these results are direct analogs of the above - mentioned approach to asymptotic nets in terms of conjugate nets in plcker quadric .",
    "the direct proof of integrability of asymptotic lattices , which does not use the theory of quadrilateral lattices , is contained in permutability theorems [ th : perm - m ] and [ th : perm - w ] .    more detailed description of results is given below .",
