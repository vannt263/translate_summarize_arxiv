    "in protein synthesis , the genetic information is deciphered into proteins by molecular machines called ribosomes that attach themselves at the start end of mrna , move along the chain in a unidirectional manner and finally detach at the stop end  @xcite .",
    "each translation step requires the binding of a freely diffusing transfer - rna ( trna ) molecule , carrying the amino acid specific to each codon  @xcite .",
    "the important factor affecting the ribosome translation rate is relative concentrations of trna , which may vary from codon to codon .",
    "the codons with lower concentrations of trna reduce the protein synthesis rate and thus plays the role of an inhomogeneity in a homogeneous system  @xcite . apart from this",
    ", inhomogeneities also occur naturally in many other transport systems such as vehicular traffic  @xcite , blood flow  @xcite and flow of data in a von neumann architecture  @xcite . in traffic flow ,",
    "the ongoing construction on roads , a slow moving vehicle or an accident can lead to slow down the flow rate on highways and can lead to congestion .",
    "further , the separation of the cpu and the memory in computers creates von neumann bottleneck , which limits the performance of the computer via limited bandwidth between the cpu and the memory .",
    "totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep )  @xcite is well known to be a paradigmatic model for studying stochastic transport in many - particle systems .",
    "both single - channel and multi - channel taseps have been well explored theoretically as well as using monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "further , one has to take into account the fact that the proteins as molecular motors can also attach from the bulk reservoir or detach from it ( langmuir kinetics ( lk ) )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to tasep , where total number of particles remain conserved , the additional attachment - detachment dynamics ( lk dynamics ) violate the particle conservation and leads to many interesting phenomena  @xcite . in literature , the consequences of coupling of the two different dynamics : tasep and lk have been well analyzed in single - channel  @xcite as well as two - channel homogeneous systems  @xcite .",
    "the idea of slowing down of particles at certain defect positions can be incorporated in the form of a set of inhomogeneous lattice sites ( bottleneck ) , either as a single unit or randomly distributed over the whole lattice in tasep .",
    "this type of disorder is known as site - wise disorder .",
    "another type of disorder studied in literature is particle - wise , where a slow moving particle itself acts as an inhomogeneity in the system .",
    "the present work focuses on site - wise disorder which is suitable to model the inhomogeneities present in transport of molecular motors .",
    "although a lot of work has been done on homogeneous taseps , the effect of disorder on the steady - state dynamics of such systems is not well understood .",
    "several studies have been performed on single - channel inhomogeneous taseps with  @xcite as well as without lk  @xcite .",
    "while investigating the role of a bottleneck in a closed tasep  @xcite , it was found that even the presence of a single bottleneck site can produce shock profile and a plateau in the fundamental current - density relation .",
    "later , kolomeisky  @xcite examined even richer case of single - channel open system and explored the consequences of the inhomogeneity with both faster and slower transition rates .",
    "he divided the system into two homogeneous taseps coupled at the single bottleneck site ( defect mean - field theory ( dmft ) ) and proved analytically that a fast site has no effect on the phase diagram ; whereas a slow site leads to shifting of the phase boundaries only .",
    "he also tested the theoretical results with monte carlo simulations and found a good agreement in low density ( ld ) and high density ( hd ) phases ; while a little deviation in maximal current ( mc ) phase",

    "the more complex case of inhomogeneous tasep in the presence of langmuir kinetics was studied by qiu et al .",

    "parallel to the inhomogeneous single - channel systems , particles in multi - channel transport systems  @xcite may also confront a bottleneck , present in either one or in more than one channels .",
    "the importance of studying the multi - channel system lies in the fact that it can act as a framework for extending the analysis to networks . due to the complexity in dynamics generating from the interactions between different channels , it is difficult to examine the effects of inhomogeneity in a multi - channel open system . up to our knowledge",

    "@xcite , this approach fails to produce the steady - state phase diagrams of the two - channel system .",
    "moreover , it is not feasible to analyze the role played by various parameters such as lane - changing rate , attachment - detachment rate and strength of bottleneck on the steady - state dynamics .",
    "one can infer from here that though dmft is capable to provide analytic solutions for single - channel inhomogeneous taseps with  @xcite as well as without lk  @xcite , it lacks some important ingredients to generate a complete picture of the dynamics of the corresponding two - channel system as discussed in section  [ sec:3 ] .",

    "although inhomogeneity is present in only one lane , yet they divided both the lanes into two sub - lanes separated at the position of bottleneck site and introduced effective exit and entrance rates at bottleneck site , respectively in each lane . using mean - field approximation with some simplified assumptions , they computed the nonlinear system of equations in terms of effective rates and solved it numerically .",
    "the steady - state density profiles obtained using dmft are found to be in good agreement with monte carlo simulations .",
    "but the incompetency of this approach lies in the fact that the nonlinear system may not have a unique feasible solution always for all choices of parameters , due to which the complete information about the steady - state dynamics is missing .",
    "moreover , the phase diagrams can not be obtained and it is not feasible to quantify the role played by different parameters such as lane changing rate , attachment - detachment rates and bottleneck rate etc . since this approach uses the concept of dividing each lane ( inhomogeneous as well as homogeneous ) into subsystems , its generalization either to multi - channel system or to include multiple defect sites would be a cumbersome job to handle .",

    "the effect of lane - changing rate on the dynamics is also examined and found that an increase in coupling strength weakens the bottleneck effect for any value of @xmath153 .",
    "this effect is supported by the reduction in height of upward and downward spikes with respect to increase in lane - changing rate .",
    "another important observation is that unequal attachment - detachment rates are also responsible for weakening of bottleneck effect .    here , we focused on a localized bottleneck , fixed at the middle of the lattice far away from the boundaries .",
    "the approach developed in this paper might be easily extended to analyze more general inhomogeneous systems such as those with more number of bottlenecks and also to study the influence of the location of the bottleneck in the multi - channel taseps . from the biological significance",
    ", one can say that the present study might help in optimizing the protein translation rate in multi - channel inhomogeneous systems .",
