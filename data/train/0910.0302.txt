    "the investigation of quantum coherence and quantum entanglement in quantum dot systems has been attracting much attention in the past decade because of its scalability for quantum computer . due to the rapid development of nanotechnology ,",
    "implementing quantum information processing using nanostructures is very prospective . among a diversity of nanostructures ,",
    "a prototypical one is made by fabrications on the interface of a heterostructure semiconductor as a gate - defined region containing a set of coupled electronic states .",
    "electrodes are implanted around this region to control the bias across it , and also several gates are implemented to adjust the electronic states within the central area as well as their couplings to the surrounding electrodes .",
    "because the electronic structures of these systems can be well controlled , they have been intensively and extensively studied for many purposes including understanding fundamental physical issues and building useful quantum devices .",
    "however , it is also because of its openness to the controlling electrodes , the external gates and various degrees of freedom in the host material , the central electronic region is intimately entangled with the surrounding environment .",
    "quantum entanglement among the basic units for quantum information processing , i.e. quantum bits or simply qubits , is the unique resource for exponentially speedup over classical algorithms .",
    "however , quantum entanglement between the qubit system and its environment is indeed a debt to quantum information processing .",
    "the entanglement between the system and its environment induces severe loss of quantum coherence of qubits and destroys eventually the useful entanglement among qubits .",
    "it has been realized that decoherence is the most difficult obstacle for any successful quantum information processing .",
    "therefore , the investigation of decoherence dynamics due to the entanglement of the qubit systems with the surrounding environment and the development of decoherence control protocols become the central issue in the study of quantum information processing . in this article",
    ", we will present a general theory for the description of the real time dynamics of a central electronic system coupled to multi - electrodes .",
    "the theory is build on the exact master equation for general nanostructures we derived recently using the feynman - vernon influence functional approach @xcite .",
    "this exact master equation is capable to depict the detailed decoherence dynamics of electronic states in the nanostructure with arbitrary spectral density at an arbitrary initial temperature of the reservoirs and an arbitrary bias applied to the reservoirs .",
    "historically , since it was first proposed by feynman and vernon in 1963 @xcite for quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) modelled as a central harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to a set of harmonic oscillators simulating the thermal bath , the influence functional approach has been widely used to study dissipation dynamics in quantum tunneling problems @xcite and decoherence problems in quantum measurement theory @xcite . in the early applications ,",
    "the master equation was derived for some particular class of ohmic ( white - noise ) environment @xcite .",
    "the exact master equation for the qbm with a general spectral density ( color - noise environments ) at arbitrary temperature was obtained by hu and co - workers in 1992 @xcite .",
    "applications of the qbm exact master equation cover various topics , such as quantum decoherence , quantum - to - classical transition , quantum measurement theory , and quantum gravity and quantum cosmology , etc .",
    "very recently , such an exact master equation is further extended to the systems of two entangled harmonic oscillators @xcite and two entangled optical fields @xcite for the study of non - markovian entanglement dynamics . nevertheless , using the influence functional approach to obtain the exact master equation has been largely focused on the bosonic environments in the past half century .",
    "the extension of the influence functional approach to fermion environments is just started @xcite , where the feynman path integral in terms of fermion coherent states @xcite must be used .",
    "in fact , the investigation of the environmental effects on the subsequent dynamics of the principal system one concerned is one of the essential issues in many currently interesting research topics related to quantum decoherence and dissipation phenomena .",
    "the quantum decoherence and dissipation phenomena are also associated with quantum non - equilibrium dynamics , a subject that has been investigated over a half century yet is still not completely understood .",
    "quantum decoherence in quantum computations and quantum information processes is one of the biggest challenges for practical applications of quantum mechanics . using the feynman - vernon influence functional approach to understand decoherence phenomena is fundamental in the sense that it allows to completely integrate out the environmental degrees of freedom . as a result",
    ", the back - action of the environment to the system can be fully taken into account .",
    "the resulting non - perturbation ( with respect to the coupling between the system and its environment ) master equation is indeed desirable for quantum information processing since the fast manipulations to qubit states requires a strong coupling among the constitutes .",
    "it enables us to precisely explore the real - time dynamics of the electron charge coherence in various different nanostructures under different manipulating conditions .    on the other hand , quantum measurement ( readout of qubit states )",
    "also often induces severe decoherence .",
    "therefore , precision readout of qubit states is another big challenge in quantum information processing .",
    "again due to the rapid progress in nanotechnology , electron state readout in nanostructures has been investigated experimentally with qubit systems coupling to a mesoscopic measurement device , such as single electron transistor ( set ) or quantum point contact ( qpc ) .",
    "not only its practical application to quantum information processing , but also the theoretical interests in the measurement - induced quantum decoherence have attracted much attention .",
    "in particular , in the investigation of quantum dot quantum computing with charge qubits , the qpc has been served as an ultrasensitive electrometer .",
    "the theoretical understanding of charge qubit measurement through the qpc was previously treated based on the markov approximation @xcite in which the time scale of the qubit dynamics is assumed much longer than that of the tunneling - electron correlation in the qpc .",
    "the treatments based on the markov approximation , in fact , only describe the qubit dynamics in the time - asymptotic quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "however , for the quantum measurement in terms of set or qpc , the qubit decoherence occurs in the time scale of the same order of the tunneling - electron correlation time in the measurement equipments , where the non - markovian dynamics of the qubit is significant . in the second part of this article",
    "we shall discuss a fully non - equilibrium theory we have developed recently @xcite for understanding the qubit decoherence induced by the qpc measurement , based on the keldysh non - equilibrium green function technique @xcite .",
    "the keldysh non - equilibrium green function approach is well developed for a perturbation treatment to the non - equilibrium dynamics in many - body systems @xcite",
    ". this approach has been used to study various transport phenomena in nanostructures @xcite . to make the non - equilibrium effect of the electrical reservoir more transparent , a real - time diagrammatic technique was constructed to diagrammatically calculate correlation functions of the electrical reservoir order by order in the perturbation expansion @xcite . in the investigation of the non - markovian dynamics in the double dot charge qubit induced by the qpc measurement",
    ", we developed an alternative real - time diagrammatic technique @xcite .",
    "the master equation for the charge qubit dynamics is derived and expressed in terms of irreducible diagrams up to all orders .",
    "the effect of the fluctuant measurement reservoir due to the interaction with the qubit system can be fully taken into account .",
    "the measurement - induced non - markovian decoherence in the qubit dynamics can be explicitly studied in this formulism .",
    "the prototypical nanostructure under consideration can be generally described by the following electronic hamiltonian @xmath0 where the first two terms are the general hamiltonian @xmath1 of electrons in the central region of the nanostructure . for simplicity",
    ", we shall ignore the electron - electron interaction in this article , i.e. , let @xmath2 .",
    "the third term is the hamiltonian @xmath3 describing the noninteracting electron reservoirs ( the source and drain electrodes , etc . ) labeled by the index @xmath4 .",
    "the last term is the electron tunneling hamiltonian @xmath5 between the reservoirs and the central system . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the electron creation ( annihilation ) operators of the central system and the surrounding reservoirs , respectively .",

    "@xmath13 is the corresponding renormalized hamiltonian .",
    "other two non - unitary terms in the master equation describe the reservoir - induced dissipative and noise processes with time - dependent dissipation and fluctuation coefficients , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "all these time - dependent coefficients in the master equation are derived non - perturbatively and are exact .",
    "the time - dependent fluctuations of the energy levels , @xmath16 , and the transition couplings between states , @xmath17 for @xmath18 , are the renormalization effects that contain the energy level shifts and the coupling changes between them , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the dissipation and fluctuation effects that depict the full non - markovian decoherence dynamics .",

    "these are the so - called dissipation - fluctuation kernels and represent dissipation and fluctuation effects on the central system due to its coupling to electron reservoirs .",
    "the relation between these two kernels are then seen from the dissipation - fluctuation theorem . the real time non - equilibrium electron dynamics of the central systems is fully described by the master equation .",
    "in the quantum computing scheme in terms of double quantum dots where the electron charge degree of freedom is exploited , the effects in deviating the coherency of charge dynamics are usually summarized in the fluctuations of the inter - dot coupling and energy splitting between the two local charge states .",
    "the amplitudes of these fluctuations may be estimated from measurements of the noise spectrum of electron currents and the minimum line width of elastic current peak @xcite .",
    "parallel theoretical works have been developed with different approaches in the literature for the purposes of both simulating the experimental results and understanding the physical mechanisms living in the double - dot . with the master equation shown above , a complete investigation can be carried out for the decoherence dynamics of the double dot charge qubit under coherence controls .",
    "the decoherence of the electron charges can be addressed with the back - reaction effects of the reservoirs to the double dot ( including not only the fluctuations of the inter - dot coupling and energy splitting between the two local charge states but also the non - unitary dynamical effect induced by dissipations and noises ) being fully taken into account .",
    "for the double dot charge qubit ( a schematic plot see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) ,        the corresponding hamiltonian of the central system becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the on - site energies of the left and the right dot respectively , @xmath34 is the tunnel coupling between the two sites .",
    "the double quantum dot is coupled to two electron leads on the left and the right side .",
    "specifically , the left dot is only coupled to the left lead while the right dot is only coupled to the right lead . to closely monitor the time evolution of the electronic states in this system , it is more convenient to specify the master equation in the particle number basis of the no electron state @xmath35 , the state of one electron in the left dot @xmath36 , one electron in the right dot @xmath37 , and the double occupied state of two electrons in two dots @xmath38",
    ". then the master equation is reduced to a set of coupled rate equations in this basis .",
    "furthermore , the double dot charge qubit works in the single - electron regime , where the strong coulomb blockade ( coulomb repulsion between the two sites ) plays an important role .",
    "in other words , the doubly occupied state @xmath38 must be excluded physically .",
    "this can be easily taken into account by excluding the double occupancy from the rate equations properly .",
    "the consequent rate equations excluding the double occupancy read @xcite    [ i - re ] @xmath39\\rho_{12 } + \\tilde{\\xi}_+\\rho_{11 } + \\tilde{\\xi}_-\\rho_{22 } -\\gamma^\\beta_{12}\\rho_{00},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the time - dependent coefficient matrices in the master equation ( [ mst ] ) with @xmath43 .",
    "we can reproduce other rate equations from ( [ i - re ] ) in the corresponding born - markov limit used in the literature @xcite .    to study the decoherence dynamics of the charge qubit , the spectral density must be specified .",
    "here we use a lorentzian spectral density . for the double dot charge qubit system , since the left ( right ) dot only couples to the left ( right ) electrode",
    ", the spectral density can be written explicitly as @xmath44 with @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the lorentzian spectral widths @xmath47 are indeed the bandwidths of the densities of states for the source and drain , respectively .",
    "they depict the characteristic times of the corresponding reservoirs .",
    "the larger the widths @xmath47 are , the shorter the correlation time of the reservoirs give and the lesser the memory effect shows . in the wide band limit ( wbl ) that is widely used in the literature ,",
    "the spectral density becomes energy independent . as a matter of fact",
    ", all the memory effect is wiped out .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath48 are the tunneling rates of electron tunneled into the double dot from the source and the drain , respectively .",
    "the tunneling rates @xmath48 describe the strength of the tunneling process between the dot and the reservoirs covering the leakage effect , and are experimentally adjustable through gate voltages . varying the coupling strength to the environment and the correlation time scale of the reservoirs , we are able to analyze realistically the decoherence dynamics of the double dot charge qubit .    for manipulating the charge qubit coherence ,",
    "the device is set at the resonant condition @xmath49 .",
    "the fermi surfaces of the two electrodes are aligned @xmath50 above the resonant level @xmath51 so that electrons are kept in the dot with minor probability of leakage . to simplify the problem , we consider only the symmetric double dot system where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the electron temperature is kept at @xmath54 throughout the rest of the calculations .",
    "the time - dependence of the transport coefficients in the master equation is essential for the non - martkovian dynamics during the coherence controls of charge qubit states .",
    "here we first examine the time dependent behavior of these transport coefficients .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows an example of the time dependencies of those coefficients at a few different strengths of coupling ( tunneling rate ) between the qubit and electron reservoirs , where the coupling strength can be controlled by tuning the gate voltages in experiments .",
    "the time is in unit of @xmath55 .",
    "as one can see the stronger the coupling between the qubit and the environment is , the larger fluctuation the coefficients shows that reveals the non - markov feature .    .",
    "the inter - dot tunnel coupling @xmath56 is set to be @xmath57ev with the fixed chemical potentials at @xmath58ev and the lorentzian spectral width @xmath59ev .",

    "the width @xmath62 characterizes the correlation time of the electron reservoirs , a large width @xmath62 corresponds to a short characteristic time of the reservoir .",
    "therefore , a smaller @xmath64 will make the non - markovian process more obvious in electron dynamics .",
    "this feature is shown by the time - dependence of the transport coefficients , as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "when @xmath64 becomes large enough , the time - dependence of the transport coefficients will disappear and the markovian limit may be reached .",
    "equivalently speaking , a larger width @xmath62 corresponds to a shorter correlation time of the electron reservoir , the coefficients at larger width reach their steady limit sooner .",
    "correspondingly , the dynamics of the charge qubit is also examined at different coupling strengths by plotting the time evolution of the reduced density matrix elements .",
    "[ fig:3](a)-(d ) show the time evolution of the electron population occupying the first dot given by @xmath65 , the probability of empty dots , i.e. the leakage effect by @xmath66 , and the real and imaginary parts of the off - diagonal matrix element @xmath67 .    ,",

    "the relaxation and decoherence of the qubit states are then determined by the decays of the matrix elements @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "in other words , the decay rate of @xmath72 is the relaxation time @xmath73 ( because @xmath74 ) while the decay rates of @xmath75 or im@xmath67 give the decoherence time @xmath76 , as we have discussed in @xcite .",

    "[ fig:3](b ) shows the small leakage effect .",
    "we find that the decay of the charge coherent oscillation is well described by a simple exponential decay for the off - diagonal reduced density matrix elements .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements ( populations ) are better described by a sub - exponential law when charge leakage is not negligible , otherwise simple exponential decay is better for all the cases .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath73 and the decoherence time @xmath76 can be extracted from the exact numerical solution @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , with the result @xmath79 being of the order of a few nanoseconds or less for a broad parameter range we used @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a stronger tunneling coupling @xmath63 to the electron reservoirs ( compare to the lorentzian spectral width @xmath62 ) leads to a faster decay of the coherent charge qubit oscillation and also causes severer shifts in the charge oscillation frequency .",
    "the non - markovian decoherence dynamics of charge qubit is dominated by two major effects , the memory effect and the leakage effect in the double - dot gated by electrode reservoirs .",
    "the former becomes a dominate effect when the time scale ( the inverse of the width @xmath62 ) of the reservoirs is comparable to the time scale ( @xmath80 ) of the double - dot .",
    "the latter becomes important when the electron tunneling strength between the reservoirs and dots is tuned to be large .",
    "strengthening the couplings between the reservoirs and dots disturbs the charge coherence in the double - dot significantly .",
    "however , reasonably raising up the chemical potentials @xmath81 can suppress charge leakage and maintain charge coherence .",
    "the left uncontrollable decoherence factor is the spectral width which characters how many electron states in the reservoirs effectively involving in the tunneling processes between the dots and the reservoirs .",
    "it is quite interest to see that in any case , the markov limit ( based on the rate equations derived by brandes and vorrath under born - markov approximation but without including the phonon coupling @xcite ) deviates largely from the exact solutions , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig:8 ] that even though a large bias voltage ( @xmath139 ) is applied , the qubit decoherence can still be suppressed if the qpc is fabricated to reach a narrower profile of the spectral density .",
    "the qubit states can then be read out by a significant current signal without much decoherence . in conclusion",
    ", more useful non - markovian dynamics can be manifested when the explicit effect of a realistic spectral density with a finite correlation time scale is taken into account , where the qubit decoherence can be suppressed during the qpc measurement .",
    "in this article we have made an extensive discussion on the non - markovian decoherence dynamics of a double dot charge qubit induced from the coherence controls and the qpc measurement , using the master equation we obtained from the feynman - vernon influence function approach and the keldysh non - equilibrium green function technique . for quantum information processing , decoherence dynamics of individual qubit",
    "is no doubt a key concern in these electronic systems . on the other hand , decoherence dynamics of entanglement between two qubits",
    "@xcite is another important issue for quantum information processing .",
    "some progress on decoherence entanglement dynamics in cavity optical systems has been reported based on exact master equations @xcite .",
    "further applications to the decoherence dynamics of electron charge and spin entanglement in terms of the quantum dots @xcite are expected .",
    "the full non - equilibrium electron dynamics and the real time monitoring of spin polarization processes in quantum dots are future topics .",
