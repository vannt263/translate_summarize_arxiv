    "over the past decade there has been substantial progress in the construction of nuclear forces from chiral effective field theory ( eft ) , both , on the formal level and on practical aspects  @xcite .",
    "recently several different regularization schemes have been implemented and are being explored in many - body calculations .",
    "an example are coordinate - space regulators leading to fully local two - nucleon ( nn ) and three - nucleon ( 3n ) interactions up to n@xmath2lo that can be used in quantum monte carlo calculations  @xcite . using a mixed local and nonlocal regularization scheme epelbaum _",
    "et al_. have presented a new family of improved chiral nn interactions ranging from leading - order ( lo ) to next - to - next - to - next - to - next - to leading order ( n@xmath3lo ) with five different cutoff values @xcite .",
    "this family of interactions allows for a systematic study of order - by - order convergence and cutoff dependence of nuclear structure observables , a critical aspect that was often ignored in previous nuclear structure applications .",
    "the lenpic collaboration  @xcite is exploring these interactions in few- and many - body calculations @xcite and is developing the consistent chiral 3n interactions . in a complementary development , new fitting strategies for chiral nn+3n interactions at n@xmath2lo",
    "are exploited to quantify the statistical uncertainties related to the parameter fits  @xcite . moreover",
    ", novel fit procedures are utilized that improve the description of bound - state properties for nuclei beyond the few - body domain  @xcite compared to the previous generation of chiral interactions  @xcite .",
    "there are also efforts to include the @xmath4 resonance as an explicit degree of freedom to accelerate the convergence of the chiral order expansion  @xcite .",
    "these developments on chiral interactions enable numerous applications in nuclear structure physics . to probe the predictive power of chiral interactions without introducing uncontrolled approximations , _ ab initio _",
    "many - body approaches are the methods of choice .",
    "in addition to the traditional _ ab initio _ many - body methods such as the no - core shell model ( ncsm )  @xcite and the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method  @xcite there are also recent developments like the coupled - cluster ( cc ) methods  @xcite , the self - consistent green s function methods  @xcite , and the in - medium similarity renormalization group ( im - srg )  @xcite that extend the range of _ ab initio _ nuclear structure calculations to medium - mass and heavy nuclei regime up to the tin isotopes .",
    "the importance truncated no - core shell model ( it - ncsm )  @xcite bridges the gap between the traditional and novel many - body methods , it can include the 3n interaction explicitly and can probe ground - state and excitation energies as well as spectroscopic observables in p- and lower sd - shell nuclei .",
    "these observables constitute a comprehensive testbed for the theoretical predictions of chiral eft .",
    "typically , these _ ab initio _",
    "approaches attempt to estimate uncertainties resulting from truncations and incomplete convergence with respect to the many - body space .",
    "however , in many applications of nuclear structure theory , such as the p - shell spectroscopy , the uncertainties entering through the chiral inputs have not been explored , so far .",
    "the combination of reliable many - body approaches and new chiral interactions will allow for a systematic propagation of theory uncertainties to the nuclear structure observables . as a preparatory step",
    ", we study sensitivity and correlations of different spectroscopic observables for a set of chiral nn+3n interactions . we explore the excitation spectra of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath1 and quantify the sensitivity of excitation energies on the choice of the underlying chiral interactions .",
    "the variation of the underlying interactions also provides an opportunity to detect and map - out correlations among pairs of nuclear structure observables , particularly electromagnetic moments and transition strengths .",

    "in this work we investigate interactions from three different chiral schemes that are obtained at n@xmath2lo or n@xmath7lo using different regularization and fit procedures . the first nn interaction we introduce",
    "is developed by entem and machleidt ( em )  @xcite at n@xmath7lo .",
    "the nonlocal regulator function uses a fixed cutoff of @xmath8 .",
    "this potential provides an accurate description of nn phase shifts with a comparable precision as more phenomenological high - precision potentials like argonne v18  @xcite and cd - bonn  @xcite .",
    "the em potential is widely used in nuclear structure physics and has been a standard choice in the _ ab initio _ field .    the @xmath9 interaction by ekstrm _ et al_.  @xcite is a recently developed chiral interaction at n@xmath2lo .",
    "the fits of the low - energy constants ( lecs ) have been performed with the practical optimization using no derivatives ( for squares ) ( pounders ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this potential also uses a cutoff of @xmath10 and an additional spectral function regularization ( sfr ) with a cutoff of @xmath11 .",
    "the nn interaction by epelbaum , glckle , meiner ( egm )  @xcite at n@xmath2lo uses the same non - local regularization with an additional sfr cutoff .",
    "this potential is constructed for a sequence of five cutoff combinations @xmath12 @xmath13 and provides a slightly less precise reproduction of the nn data than the other two nn interactions .",
    "the pion - nucleon lecs @xmath14 are fitted independently of the regularization to the pion - nucleon scattering data  @xcite and differ from the values used for the em and @xmath9 interactions . with the sequence of cutoff parameters it offers the unique opportunity to study the effect of the regularization on nuclear structure observables and , thus , to draw conclusions about the theoretical uncertainties originating from the chiral inputs .    for chiral interactions with non - local regulators",
    "the cutoff variation provides a legitimate diagnostic tool to estimate the uncertainties at an individual chiral order .",
    "nevertheless , a variation of the chiral order is crucial to study the convergence of the interactions and future works will combine a chiral order and cutoff variation for a more elaborate uncertainty analysis .",
    "note , for chiral interactions with local regulators , physical observables show generally a small sensitivity to variations in the cutoff  @xcite .",
    "thus , novel studies with a semi - local regularization must include information of the chiral order convergence to extract the uncertainties of the currently available nn forces  @xcite .",
    "the above nn forces are augmented by 3n forces at n@xmath2lo .",
    "the em and @xmath9 nn forces are combined with the local 3n force using a cutoff of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the lecs @xmath15 of the two - pion exchange term are adopted from the nn interaction .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is fitted to the triton @xmath17-decay half - life  @xcite and @xmath18 is fixed by the @xmath19 and @xmath20 binding energy , for the em and @xmath9 nn interaction , respectively .",
    "this yields @xmath21 for the em interaction and @xmath22 for the @xmath9 interaction . although , the @xmath9 interactions is originally a nn force for brevity we use this expression also to refer to the corresponding nn+3n interaction introduced in this work .",
    "the egm nn forces at n@xmath2lo are typically combined with a consistent non - local 3n force at n@xmath2lo . while this nn+3n force is used in several applications to neutron matter  @xcite ,",
    "nuclear structure physics beyond the lightest nuclei is fairly unknown .",
    "the lecs of the 3n force are fitted to the triton ground - state energy and the neutron - deuteron doublet scattering length  @xcite .",
    "the partial - wave decomposed 3n matrix elements at n@xmath2lo can be derived explicitly  @xcite or via a numerical partial - wave decomposition  @xcite .",
    "the latter approach is also applicable to compute the complicated 3n contributions at n@xmath7lo for future investigations .",
    "although non - local chiral nn interactions are rather soft due to the momentum cutoff in the regularization , it is still difficult to converge ncsm - type calculations beyond the lightest nuclei",
    ". also the inclusion of the relevant 3n contributions can be problematic for _ ab initio _ methods when a bare chiral interaction is used .",
    "the similarity renormalization group ( srg )  @xcite is a unitary transformation that softens the nuclear interaction and can be applied consistently in the two- and three - body space .",
    "therefore , this approach is used in a variety of nuclear structure applications to soften the chiral nn+3n interactions  @xcite .",

    "it is important to note that the srg evolution induces irreducible many - body contributions beyond the particle rank of the initial interaction . with the canonical generator",
    "it has been found  @xcite , that it is indispensable to include the induced three - body contributions .",
    "therefore , for all results presented in this paper we use an initial nn and nn+3n interaction and include all contributions up to the three - body level , which correspond to the nn+3n - induced and nn+3n - full nomenclature of previous works  @xcite .",
    "we aim at many - body calculations performed in the harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) representation .",
    "thus the nn and 3n interactions that are obtained in a partial - wave momentum representation need to be transformed to the ho space .",
    "there are techniques to perform the evolution equation of the srg in the three - body momentum representation  @xcite , however , for applications in localized systems , such as nuclei , the discrete ho jacobi basis is the most efficient scheme for the srg evolution .",
    "therefore , we immediately transform the 3n momentum matrix elements to the ho jacobi representation , performing the srg transformation subsequently .    the ho machinery , comprehensively described in  @xcite , is utilized to perform the moshinsky transformation to the particle - basis representation .",
    "eventually , the matrix elements are stored in the so - called @xmath30-coupled scheme  @xcite , which is the starting point for a number of _ ab initio _ many - body methods  @xcite .",
    "in a first step we study the excitation spectra of various p - shell nuclei using the different chiral hamiltonians introduced in sec .",
    "[ subsec : eft ]",
    ". the focus will be on the sensitivity of the different excited states on the chiral inputs , giving rise to systematic theory uncertainties that result from the various choices made during the construction of the chiral interactions .",
    "this includes , for instance , the different regularization schemes , chiral orders as well as the fit procedures used for the lecs .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty are the statistical uncertainties of the lecs resulting from the fits .",
    "the latter uncertainties have been exploited recently for few - body scattering and ground - state observables  @xcite , but remain to be investigated for p - shell spectroscopy .",
    "we employ the it - ncsm with the srg evolved hamiltonians based on the chiral nn or nn+3n interactions discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : srg ] . for all hamiltonians",
    "the it - ncsm calculation includes explicit 3n terms of the srg - evolved hamiltonians .",
    "we perform a full ncsm calculations up to @xmath31 for @xmath5 and @xmath32 for @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "we efficiently proceed to larger @xmath33 with an importance truncation including a threshold extrapolation towards the full ncsm space .",
    "the details of the it - ncsm and the threshold extrapolation are discussed in  @xcite . on",
    "should note that the threshold extrapolation itself induces a theoretical uncertainty at the level of the final observables , which is quantified systematically through the extrapolation protocol  @xcite .",
    "for excitation energies this uncertainty is of the order of @xmath34 for the largest spaces .",
    "the it extrapolation is very robust for the discussed excitation spectra in this work .",
    "the only exception is the first excited @xmath35 state in @xmath1 for a single egm interaction , where the degeneracy with the first @xmath36 state causes inaccurate it extrapolations , resulting in an unreliable assessment of the angular momentum of this state .",
    "+    we start with the simple nucleus @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : itncsm_li6_spec ] shows the excitation energies of the first four positive parity states obtained with the different chiral nn and nn+3n interactions . to indicate the uncertainty due to the convergence with respect to the model space we compare the results at @xmath37 ( dashed bars ) and @xmath38 ( solid bars ) .",
    "the calculations are carried out at @xmath39 and the srg evolution up to @xmath40 is performed at the three - body level . as illustrated for the @xmath1 spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite once the srg evolution is performed consistently at the three - body level , excitation energies show a negligible flow - parameter dependence .",
    "this remains true even for heavier systems , where the absolute energies show a sizable flow - parameter dependence  @xcite .",
    "since the srg induced beyond-3n contributions predominantly cause an overall shift of all energies , their impact cancels out for the excitation energies .",
    "in addition to the spectra for the individual interactions including the initial nn and nn+3n part , respectively , fig .  [",
    "fig : itncsm_li6_spec ] also shows a combined spectrum for all the egm interactions , where the bands indicate the spread of the excitation energies obtained with the different cutoffs .",
    "we observe that the excitation energies obtained with the em and the @xmath9 hamiltonians typically fall into the bands extracted for the egm interactions .",
    "+    a first inspection of the spectra reveals that the sensitivity of the different excited states to the hamiltonian is quite different . whereas the excitation energy of the first @xmath41 state is largely unaffected by the different choices of chiral interactions or the inclusion of the chiral 3n force , the excitation energies of the @xmath42 and the @xmath43 states show a sizable variation .",
    "the inclusion of the chiral 3n interaction causes a shift of the energies in the same direction for all hamiltonians , leading to a higher @xmath0 and a lower @xmath42 excitation energy for the full nn+3n interactions . in the case of the egm interactions , the band constructed from the cutoff dependence of the @xmath42 excitation energy nicely overlaps with the experimental energy . for the @xmath0 excitation energy",
    "there is a clear discrepancy and the chiral 3n interaction shifts the state further away from the experimental energy in all cases .",
    "however , the first @xmath0 state in the experimental spectrum is a broad resonance and there is a narrow second @xmath0 state about @xmath44 mev above .",
    "thus the inclusion of continuum degrees of freedom , e.g. , through the ncsm with continuum  @xcite , will be important to understand and disentangle these @xmath0 states .",
    "the slow convergence of the calculated @xmath0 state might serve as a first indication for these continuum effects . for the @xmath41 excitation energy ,",
    "the egm band is closer to experiment although it does not overlap either  experimentally this state is a narrow resonance",
    ".     +    figure  [ fig : itncsm_c12_spec ] shows a similar analysis of the excitation spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "the excitation energies of the lowest positive - parity states obtained in it - ncsm calculations are shown for all interactions . obviously , the structure of excitation spectrum of @xmath1 is richer than for @xmath5 .",
    "previous investigations have shown that some of the excitation energies , e.g. , for the first @xmath43 and @xmath45 states , are very sensitive to the 3n interaction .",
    "furthermore , in comparison to experiment there are clear discrepancies of the @xmath43 excitation energy obtained for the em interaction when including the 3n interaction  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of these states for different chiral interactions is , therefore , highly interesting .",
    "note , the excited @xmath35 states are expected to have a distinct cluster structure that can not be described accurately in tractable ho model spaces  @xcite . therefore , it is not clear whether the @xmath41 state obtained in the it - ncsm corresponds the first excited @xmath41 state ( hoyle state ) or the second one ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . for these reasons",
    ", we will not include this @xmath41 state into the following discussion on the sensitivity to the hamiltonian .    comparing",
    "the spectra for the different interactions confirms the sensitivity of the @xmath43 and @xmath45 excitation energies to the underlying interaction , also the higher - lying @xmath0 state shows a large sensitivity .",
    "for all these states the sensitivity , as summarized by the bands for the egm interactions , reduces significantly with the inclusion of the chiral 3n interaction .",
    "this might be interpreted as indication that the theoretical uncertainties are reduced when going from an incomplete chiral nn interaction to a complete and consistent chiral nn+3n hamiltonian at n@xmath2lo .",
    "for all interactions , the chiral 3n component shifts the @xmath43 states to lower excitation energies . as a result , all interactions underestimate the @xmath43 excitation energy by more than 2 mev  even considering the uncertainty band , there is a clear discrepancy with experiment .",
    "since all hamiltonians employed here use local or non - local 3n interactions at n@xmath2lo , it will be very interesting the see whether next - generation chiral 3n interactions at n@xmath7lo can resolve this discrepancy .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath43 and @xmath45 states , the energy of the first excited @xmath0 state shows very little sensitivity to the starting interaction and to the chiral 3n contribution .",
    "the bands extracted from the egm interactions are small and the bands with and without the chiral 3n interaction overlap .",
    "interestingly , all interactions tend to underestimate the @xmath0 excitation energy slightly .",
    "it is also interesting to study the absolute @xmath1 ground - state energies resulting from the different nn+3n interactions .",
    "the energies calculated with the egm interactions span a range of @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "this range contains the experimental energy of @xmath48 .",
    "also the ground - state energy obtained with n@xmath2lo@xmath49 interaction is within the egm range , while the em interactions predicts an energy of @xmath50 and thus the largest binding energy .",
    "however , it is important to note , that the energies are extrapolated from ncsm model spaces up to @xmath37 causing an estimated extrapolation uncertainty of about @xmath51 .",
    "what is more important is the impact of omitted srg - induced 4n contributions that are sizable for the srg flow - parameter @xmath40 used here . from an analysis of the flow - parameter dependence we find that the 4n contributions are repulsive and ,",
    "thus , will reduce the above binding energies .",
    "for instance , changing @xmath25 for the em interaction to @xmath52 , i.e. , towards the bare interaction reduces the binding energy by about @xmath53 .",
    "based on the flow - parameter dependence we can not reliably estimate the binding energy expected for the bare interaction . nevertheless , we can conclude that the absolute binding energies for the bare interactions will exhibit a spread of several mev and tend to underestimate the experimental binding energies .",
    "this sensitivity of the absolute binding energies to the details of the interactions is consistent with the finding in  @xcite for the @xmath54 ground - state energy .    as the final case , we discuss the excitation spectrum of @xmath6 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : itncsm_b10_spec ] .",
    "the typical excitation energies for this odd - odd nucleus are much smaller than in @xmath1 , therefore , shifts of the excitation energies of individual states by 1 mev can change the spectrum drastically . furthermore , full convergence of the excitation energies is more difficult to reach than for the @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "particularly the results with chiral 3n interactions show a residual @xmath33 dependence , i.e. , the excitation energies for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : itncsm_b10_spec ] by the solid and dashed levels , respectively , are slightly different .",
    "this residual @xmath33 dependence is much smaller than the variations due to different hamiltonians and , therefore , do not affect the present discussion .",
    "already the first _ ab initio _ calculations of @xmath6 with 3n interactions have shown that the ordering of the first @xmath42 and @xmath43 states depends on the 3n interaction  @xcite .",
    "many of the realistic nn interactions incorrectly predict the @xmath43 as ground state and only the 3n interaction restores the correct level ordering .",
    "this is also observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : itncsm_b10_spec ] for the chiral interactions  with one exception",
    "all chiral nn interactions predict the @xmath43 below or degenerate with the @xmath42 state . in all these cases , the chiral 3n interaction shifts the @xmath43 upwards relative to the @xmath42 , thus , restoring the correct level ordering .",
    "an exception is the egm interaction with cutoffs @xmath57 , which already gives the correct level ordering with the nn interaction , the chiral 3n interaction only leads to a slight reduction of all excitation energies .",
    "the egm uncertainty band for the @xmath43 excitation energy is reduced by including the chiral 3n interaction and robustly indicates the @xmath42 as the ground state . within the cutoff - uncertainty bands all excitation energies obtained with the chiral nn+3n are compatible with experiment .",
    "our uncertainty analysis for the p - shell spectra provides a crucial verification of the predictive power of the chiral interactions . besides distinct sensitivities of excitation energies to the 3n force , also systematic deviations from experiment beyond the theoretical uncertainty",
    "can be identified .",
    "these investigations identify the first @xmath43 state in @xmath1 as an ideal benchmark for the next generation of chiral nn+3n interactions .",
    "electromagnetic observables provide another window into structure of nuclei with different sensitivities and addressing complementary information .",
    "therefore , we extend the discussion of sensitivities of nuclear observables to electromagnetic moments and transition strengths , focusing on electric quadrupole ( e2 ) and magnetic dipole ( m1 ) observables .    coming from the discussion of excitation energies ,",
    "several comments are in order : first , the convergence rate of electromagnetic observables , particularly of e2 observables , is significantly slower than the convergence of excitation energies .",
    "owing to the sensitivity of the e2 operator on the long - range behavior of the wave function , large ncsm basis spaces are required to obtain the correct asymptotic behavior of the wave functions and to converge e2 observables .",
    "eventually , one might still rely on extrapolations , e.g. , within the novel schemes constructed in an effective field theory framework  @xcite , to extract a robust result .",
    "second , the e2 or m1 operators should be transformed consistently with the hamiltonian when using srg transformations to improve the convergence behavior .",
    "the effect of this consistent srg transformation of electromagnetic operators was only studied in a few selected cases .",
    "these studies indicated that the consistent srg transformation changes electromagnetic observables only by a few percent  @xcite , which is why ncsm applications have not included these effect so far .",
    "finally , chiral eft also predicts the electromagnetic two - body current contributions consistently with the interactions . also these contributions should be included for a complete treatment of electromagnetic observables",
    ". pioneering calculation in a hybrid framework using chiral eft currents with an argonne interaction have indicated a significant influence of current contribution to electromagnetic moments and transition strengths  @xcite .",
    "addressing all these effects in a comprehensive fashion will be the aim of our future studies of electromagnetic properties starting from consistent chiral eft inputs . in a preparatory step towards the complete calculations , we study the impact of the hamiltonian on e2 and m1 observables . as a novel aspect in the _ ab initio _ context",

    "the picture regarding correlations is also different from the e2 observables , the calculations do not collapse on a universal correlation line .",

    "[ fig : li6_m1 ] , provides an interesting perspective .",
    "the ground - state magnetic dipole moment of @xmath5 is known with an excellent accuracy from atomic physics measurements  @xcite .",
    "the calculations with chiral nn+3n interactions deviate from experiment by about 2%though this is a small deviation by our standards , it is very systematic .",
    "the experimental uncertainty on the @xmath108 are larger and most of the calculations fall within the error bar of the experiment .",
    "however , the systematic @xmath33 dependence of the calculation suggests that the converged @xmath108 will be outside the experimental error bar for all hamiltonians .",
    "this is clearly a case where precision studies , both in experiment and in _ ab initio _ theory will be very valuable . as mentioned in the beginning of this section ,",
    "our studies of electromagnetic observables are not fully complete yet .",
    "we have not included the consistent srg evolution of the electromagnetic operators and we have not included consistent electromagnetic two - body currents from chiral eft . both corrections enter as additive two - body pieces in the electromagnetic operators and they will affect both observables in the pairs of e2 and m1 observables discussed here . in case of the e2 observables , we expect the correlation line to be largely unaffected by these corrections .",
    "however , they will play a role for the specific values of the observables , particularly at the precision level of the m1 observables discussed above .",
    "this aspect will be a focus of our future studies .",
    "we have presented _ ab initio _ it - ncsm calculations for the spectroscopy of p - shell nuclei using a large set of different chiral nn+3n interactions . in this way we addressed the sensitivity of excitation spectra and electromagnetic observables to the input interactions , which constitutes a significant and previously unexplored contribution to the theory uncertainties of state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the variation of the input interactions also provides yet unexplored insights into the details of nuclear structure .",
    "we discussed the sensitivities of individual excitation energies and compared the resulting theory uncertainties to experiment .",
    "this provides an important diagnostic for the chiral interactions , particularly in case of a systematic disagreement with experiment beyond the uncertainties obtained from the different interactions .",
    "an example is the excitation energy of the first @xmath43 state in @xmath1 , where the sensitivity to the different chiral nn+3n interactions is much smaller than the deviation from experiment",
    ". this will be an important test case for next - generation chiral interactions .    for electromagnetic observables",
    "the variation of the underlying interaction and of the model - space truncation allowed us to identify robust correlations between pairs of e2 observables merging from _ ab initio _ calculations , which can be interpreted in terms of a rigid rotor model .",
    "these correlations offer a new tool to extract accurate predictions for _ ab initio _ calculations . by combining the theoretically predicted correlations of two observables with a single experimental datum for one observable we can extract a value for the second observable that is far more accurate and robust than any direct _ ab initio _ result .",
    "an example is the quadrupole moment of the first excited @xmath0 state in @xmath1 , that we predict to be @xmath84 based on the experimental value of the associated @xmath65 .",
    "this work is a preparatory step towards a full quantification of theory uncertainties based on consistent inputs from chiral eft .",
    "for example , using the new family of chiral interactions from lo to n@xmath3lo developed within the lenpic collaboration  @xcite , we will be able to study the order - by - order systematics of nuclear observables and thus propagate the eft uncertainties consistently to the level of nuclear structure observables . including two - body currents and consistent srg - evolution for the electromagnetic observables will be another important milestone towards precision _ ab initio _ calculations that exploit the full potential of chiral eft .",
