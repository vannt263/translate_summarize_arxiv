    "orion  kl ( kleinmann - low object ) is one of the nearest massive star - forming regions at a distance of 420  pc @xcite and hence , has been the most extensively studied source in the context of star - formation study @xcite .",
    "there are powerful outflows and jets possibly associated with young stellar objects ( ysos ) in this region at a wide range of spatial scales from @xmath2100  au to @xmath310000  au .",
    "they are traced by various molecular lines such as vibrationally excited sio masers at 43  ghz @xcite , 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser @xcite , millimeter / submillimeter thermal sio @xcite and co lines @xcite , and near - infrared h@xmath0 line @xcite .",
    "these observational studies have revealed physical properties of the outflows , jets , and surrounding shocked materials interacting with ambient clouds .    among a number of tracers ,",
    "the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser is known to be a unique tracer to investigate a three - dimensional velocity structure .",
    "thanks to its extremely high brightness , it can be detected by high - resolution interferometers and very long baseline interferometers ( vlbi ) providing a capability of proper motion measurements . as a result",
    ", the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser in orion  kl is found to be tracing a low - velocity outflow along a northeast - southwest axis @xcite centered at a strong radio continuum source labeled i @xcite .",
    "hereafter we call this source  i.    one of these h@xmath0o maser features in orion  kl has exhibited an enormous outburst , which is sometimes called supermaser .",
    "the h@xmath0o maser burst in orion  kl was reported in 1979 - 1985 for the first time @xcite followed by 1998 - 1999 @xcite .",
    "based on vlbi observations , the supermaser was revealed to have east - west or northwest - southeast elongations in 1979 - 1985 and 1998 - 1999 , respectively .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) was stable at @xmath4 8  km  s@xmath5 , suggesting a common origin .",
    "although the maser burst could be related to star - formation activities in orion  kl , either a circumstellar disk @xcite or a jet / outflow driven by a yso @xcite , its origin and mechanism are still under debate .",
    "the third burst of the h@xmath0o maser in orion  kl has started since february 2011 @xcite .",
    "the burst appears to be possibly periodic with an interval of about 13  years ( 1985 , 1998 , and 2011 ) .",
    "it could support the hypothesis of a common origin @xcite .",
    "we have carried out astrometric monitoring observations with vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) since 2011 march @xcite and studied basic properties of the supermaser .",
    "main conclusions by @xcite are ( 1 ) the burst occurs at two spatially nearby but distinct components ( separation of @xmath410  mas ) at the lsr velocities of 6.95 and 7.58  km  s@xmath5 ( hereafter we call them `` 6.9  km  s@xmath5 '' and `` 7.5  km  s@xmath5 '' features , respectively , using representative velocities ) as reported in previous bursts @xcite , ( 2 ) these features are elongated along a northwest - southeast direction perpendicular to the low - velocity outflow and their proper motions are parallel to the outflow axis , and ( 3 ) the absolute position of the supermaser is coincident with a shocked molecular gas called the orion compact ridge .",
    "all of these characteristics suggest that the supermaser could be excited in an interacting region between the low - velocity outflow and the ambient gas in the compact ridge @xcite .    nevertheless , the maximum flux density for the current burst phase is reported to be 44000  jy on may 2011 @xcite .",
    "it is much lower than those in previous bursts in which the flux densities of the supermaser reached 10@xmath6  jy @xcite .",
    "although the maser bursts could have possible periodicity of 13  years , 1985 , 1998 , and 2011 , it is still unclear whether all of three events are caused by a common origin . in order to understand their origin and to reveal their relationship between star - formation activities in orion  kl in relation to outflows , jets , and interaction with ambient clouds ,",
    "it is important to continue further monitoring observations of the supermaser at a current valuable opportunity .    in this paper , we report results of our continued monitoring observations of the supermaser with vera to investigate time variations of their properties .",
    "in addition , we present follow - up observations with atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) to identify possible powering source(s ) , as well as to study pumping mechanisms based on multi - transition h@xmath0o lines .",
    "although we find that the current burst activity is lower by a factor of 10 than those in previous bursts in terms of the maser flux density as discussed later , we call the current bursting maser feature `` supermaser '' throughout the present paper .",
    "observations of the @xmath7-@xmath8 transition of h@xmath0o at 22.235080  ghz @xcite in orion  kl were carried out with vera .",
    "details of the observations have been described in separate papers @xcite , and we briefly summarize key parameters in this section .",
    "vlbi monitoring observations have been conducted regularly since 2011 march with a typical interval of 1 - 4  weeks .",
    "the maximum baseline length of vera is 2270  km and the resultant fringe - spacing is 1.2  mas .",
    "we employed the dual beam observation mode , in which orion  kl and an icrf source j054138.0 - 054149 @xcite were observed simultaneously , to measure the absolute position of the target h@xmath0o maser in orion  kl with respect to the positional reference source .",
    "the astrometric accuracy is estimated to be 0.4  mas according to post - fit residuals of proper motion measurements .",
    "these two sources were observed for 8  hours being tracked from horizon to horizon at the lowest elevation angle of @xmath415  degrees .",
    "a typical on - source time was 6  hours for each epoch . in this paper , we report the astrometric and imaging results of the first 18 epochs of observations from 2011/068 to 2012/269 ( hereafter we indicate an epoch of observation as year / day of the year ) . a spectral resolution was set to be 15.625  khz , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 0.21  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "calibration and synthesis imaging were performed using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package in the same manner employed previously @xcite .",
    "we also used other data of vera observations at 22  ghz including orion  kl as a fringe - finder to investigate a time variation in spectral profiles .",
    "a total number of spectral line monitoring data is 53 epochs from 2008/329 to 2014/025 . on - source",
    "integration times of each spectral line monitoring data for orion  kl was 5 - 10  minutes .",
    "in addition , we used alma data taken in one of the early science projects in cycle  0 ( ads / jao.alma#2011.0.00199.s ) to compare images of submillimeter continuum emissions and molecular lines .",
    "observations were carried out at the alma band  7 ( in the range of 320 - 340  ghz ) on 2012 july 16 , august 25 , and october 21 .",
    "they were almost coincident with the most active burst phase as discussed in the next section . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the @xmath9-@xmath10 h@xmath0o line at 321.225656  ghz @xcite and methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath1 ) lines close to the h@xmath0o line .",
    "the maximum baseline length in our alma observations was 400  m , corresponding to a spatial resolution of @xmath40.5 , depending on the uv weighting in the imaging .",
    "synthesis imaging and self - calibration were done with the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package .",
    "further details of observations are reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig - sp ] shows spectra of the supermaser observed in 18 epochs of the regular astrometry observations from 2011 to 2012 , and figure [ fig - time ] shows time variations of the flux density , velocity width , and peak velocity for all the observed epochs including both 18 epochs of the regular astrometry and 53 epochs of the spectral line monitoring observations . first , these parameters are determined by fitting a single gaussian to the observed profile .",
    "however , there are two distinct velocity components at @xmath46.9  km  s@xmath5 and @xmath47.5  km  s@xmath5 as reported in @xcite .",
    "these components can be clearly seen in spectral profiles such as the double - peaked structure on 2011/121 and 2011/137 and red - shifted shoulder on 2011/208 ( figure [ fig - sp ] ) .",
    "this results in a significant deviation from the observed line profile in the fitting .",
    "thus , we next fit two gaussians to the observed profiles for these epochs . although these line parameters show slightly larger error bars as shown in figure [ fig - time ] , we can see time variations of flux density , velocity width , and peak velocity for the @xmath47.5  km  s@xmath5 component continuously changing even during this phase .",
    "in contrast , the velocity component that appeared later at @xmath46.9  km  s@xmath5 shows a different time variation .    according to characteristics of the time variation in figure [ fig - time ]",
    ", we can divide the monitoring period of the current h@xmath0o maser burst into four phases ; a moderately active phase in 2009 followed by a relatively quiescent phase in 2010 , a start of the burst with rapid variation in 2011 , the maximum phase in 2012 , and a quiescent / possible initial phase of the next burst in 2013 .    in 2009 , there is a moderately active phase slowly increasing and decreasing in the flux density both in total power and cross power spectra .",
    "timescales of both rising and falling phases , which are defined as periods from minimum to maximum and maximum to minimum flux densities , respectively , are almost equal , 10  months and 11  months , respectively ( figure [ fig - flux](a ) ) . during this phase , the peak velocity is also slightly changing from 7.4 to 7.3  km  s@xmath5 while the velocity width , @xmath40.8  km  s@xmath5 , is almost stable with time .",
    "after this moderately active phase in 2009 , the maser activity becomes a quiescent phase , whereas the total and correlated flux densities are as high as 2400  jy and 500  jy , respectively , at the minimum phase on 2010/227 . toward this minimum phase ,",
    "the velocity width of the total - power spectrum gradually increases although that of the cross - power spectrum shows a decreasing trend . at the minimum phase on 2010/227 , the velocity width and peak velocity change drastically .",
    "furthermore , these parameters show significant differences between total - power and cross - power spectra but with larger uncertainties than other epochs .",
    "this could be caused by other velocity components as their contributions become more and more significant relative to that of the 7.5  km  s@xmath5 component . before and after this minimum phase , there were breaks of monitoring observations each for 100  days due to the maintenance of the vera antennas , and hence , we could not trace time variations in this quiescent phase .",
    "the h@xmath0o maser burst has started in the end of 2010 or the beginning of 2011 @xcite .",
    "the flux density of the total - power spectrum at @xmath47.5  km  s@xmath5 has started to increase since 2010/350 while that of the cross power spectrum is temporarily halted on 2010/360 followed by the brightening from 2011/023 . although there is a lack of maser images , this might reflect a variation in the spatial structure of the emitting region . at the beginning of the current burst phase in 2011",
    ", there are two maximum phases on 2011/60 - 2011/121 and 2011/296 - 2011/311 with the total flux density of about 50000  jy ( figure [ fig - time ] ) .",
    "the timescales of rising and falling phases are 7  months and 3  months , respectively , for the maximum phase of 2011/60 - 2011/121 ( figure [ fig - flux](b ) ) , although the flux density in this phase shows a variability rather than a monotonic increase or decrease .",
    "the timescales for the subsequent maximum phase of 2011/296 - 2011/311 ( figure [ fig - flux](c ) ) are 2  months for both rising and falling phases .",
    "apart from the different timescales , the behaviors in rising and falling phases seem to be symmetric as seen in the active phase in 2009 ( figure [ fig - flux ] ) . as discussed above , the burst appears to occur in two different velocity components at 6.9  km  s@xmath5 and 7.5  km  s@xmath5 @xcite as seen in figures [ fig - time](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the burst activity is temporarily stopped at the end of 2011 , but more active burst has started in early 2012 .",
    "the maximum total flux density of 135000  jy is recorded on 2012/154 at the peak velocity of 7.4  km  s@xmath5 . in this most active phase , the flux density monotonically increases with the timescale of 5  months .",
    "the velocity width is about 0.60 - 0.75  km  s@xmath5 , which is the narrowest value observed in our monitoring as shown in figure [ fig - time](b ) .",
    "on 2012/123 , the derived velocity widths show the minimum values of 0.50@xmath110.02  km  s@xmath5 and 0.46@xmath110.02  km  s@xmath5 for the total - power and cross - power spectra , respectively . only in this epoch ,",
    "the velocity widths are significantly narrower than those observed just before and after this epoch ( 2012/107 and 2012/145 ) . due to the lack of maser images on 2012/123 , we do not discuss what is the true reason for these narrower velocity widths only at this epoch .",
    "the flux density of the maser decreases with the timescale of 4  months after this maximum phase .",
    "it should be noted that the time variations in rising and falling phases again seem to be symmetric as seen in figure [ fig - flux](d ) . at the end of the burst phase in 2012/265 and 2012/269 ,",
    "the peak velocities of cross - power spectra show significant differences from those of the total - power spectra .",
    "they are thought to be the results of significant contributions from other velocity components and/or effects of structure changes in maser features .",
    "this effect is seen particularly in less active phases such as in 2010 .",
    "finally , the burst activity seems to end around 2012/269 while it again appears to be brightening from 2013/138 .",
    "it is most likely an ignition of a newly occurred burst event .",
    "we will continue monitoring observations with vera of the time variation of the supermaser in orion  kl .",
    "still , the activity of the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser burst in 2011 - 2012 is relatively lower by a factor of 10 in comparison with the previous bursts in which the peak flux densities reached 10@xmath6  jy .",
    "we note that the fluxes reported in figures [ fig - time ] and [ fig - flux ] are those integrated over the whole region including both the supermaser and other features .",
    "we investigate possible contribution from other maser features at almost the same velocity with the supermaser feature in the 18 epochs of our vlbi imaging .",
    "although it is difficult to make full channel maps with a wide field of view of an order of 10 , we search for positions of the maser features detected by @xcite . as a result , we detect one maser feature around the position offset of ( @xmath43.175 , @xmath4 - 1.850 ) in right ascension and declination , respectively , with respect to the supermaser feature .",
    "@xcite detected two maser features near this position at the velocities of 6.3  km  s@xmath5 and 7.6  km  s@xmath5 with the flux densities of 21.0  jy and 897.7  jy , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig - se ] shows the flux density of this maser feature ( we call this feature `` se feature '' ) and the flux density ratio relative to the supermaser feature .",
    "the flux density of the se feature increases with time and the maximum phase is observed on 2012/244 .",
    "it is about 2 months after the maximum phase of the supermaser . even around the maximum phase of the se feature ,",
    "a possible contribution to the total flux density is as large as  8% as shown in figure [ fig - se ] ( b ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the contamination from other maser features including the se features are not significant in figures [ fig - time ] and [ fig - flux ] .      the time variation of the linewidth of the supermaser implies an anti - correlation with the flux density as shown in figure [ fig - dv ] .",
    "according to model calculations , the line profile of the maser first tends to be narrower as its intensity increases as long as the maser is unsaturated @xcite .",
    "then the maser line starts to rebroaden when it becomes saturated @xcite . under the condition of an unsaturated maser",
    ", the logarithm of the flux density of the maser line , @xmath12 , is predicted to be proportional to the inverse square of the linewidth , @xmath13 . in figure [ fig - dv ] , we also show best - fit results ; @xmath14    our results may suggest that the supermaser in the current burst phase is still unsaturated .",
    "it is consistent with the observed narrow linewidths , 0.40 - 0.48  km  s@xmath5 , of the supermaser in 1998 - 1999 possibly attributed to the line narrowing for an unsaturated maser @xcite .",
    "in contrast , no clear relationship between the flux density and linewidth is found in the burst in 1979 - 1985 @xcite , suggesting a saturated maser emission .",
    "the difference in the degree of saturation could be attributed to the lower flux density , @xmath410@xmath15  jy in the current burst phase than those in the previous bursts , @xmath310@xmath6  jy @xcite .",
    "we note that the line narrowing is predicted to occur even for a saturated maser if a stimulated emission rate is not large compared with the cross - relaxation rate @xcite .",
    "this means that the above relation holds when the maser flux density is not enough large regardless of saturated or unsaturated cases .",
    "thus , we can not firmly estimate the degree of saturation of the supermaser by judging from the linewidth - flux density relation only .",
    "figure [ fig - map ] represents channel maps of the phase - referenced images of the supermaser in 2011/137 .",
    "three spatially distinct components are found in the initial phase of the burst from 2011/068 to 2011/137 as reported previously @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the 22  ghz h@xmath0o line ( 6@xmath16 - 5@xmath17 ) has a hyperfine structure with 3 main components and that the @xmath18=7 - 6 and 5 - 4 components appear with the separation of + 0.45  km  s@xmath5 and -0.58  km  s@xmath5 with respect to the central component , @xmath18=6 - 5 @xcite .",
    "the velocity separation of -0.58  km  s@xmath5 is consistent with that observed for two bursting features .",
    "however , our results suggest that the two velocity components observed at 6.9  km  s@xmath5 and 7.5  km  s@xmath5 in the supermaser are not emitted from the same masing gas clump . thus , these two velocity components are unlikely due to the hyperfine structure but they corresponds to distinct masing gas clumps with different positions and velocities .",
    "we conduct two - dimensional gaussian fittings on the phase - referenced images to measure the absolute position of each maser spot .",
    "hereafter , we define a `` spot '' as a maser emission identified in a single velocity channel and a `` feature '' as a group of spots that are spatially coincident in two or more consecutive velocity channels . by using these results , we derive the absolute proper motions of the detected spots as summarized in table [ tab - proper ] and figure [ fig - position ] .",
    "we find that the northern feature , feature 1 ( or spots 1 , 3 , and 5 ) , is detectable only until 2011/296 ( table [ tab - proper ] ) .",
    "the lifetime of the northern feature 1 is about 8  months . given the typical monitoring interval and detection criterion , in which a spot is regarded as real when it is detected for more than three contiguous epochs , we might miss a short - term variation of a maser spot on phase - referenced images within a lifetime of less than @xmath42  months .    according to the absolute proper motion measurements",
    ", the supermaser features are apparently moving toward south and southwest directions as shown in the gray arrows in figure [ fig - map ] .",
    "the derived proper motions are consistent but are more reliable than those previously obtained @xcite because we have continued the proper motion measurements in a longer observing period . when we subtract a modulation of an annual parallax of 2.39  mas @xcite and the absolute proper motion of a possible powering source of the low - velocity outflow , source  i ( @xmath19 , @xmath20)=(6.3  mas  yr@xmath5 , -4.2  mas  yr@xmath5 ) , measured by astrometric observations with the very large array ( vla ) @xcite , the derived proper motion vectors with respect to source  i point toward west and southwest directions as drawn in the black arrows in figure [ fig - map ] . the magnitude of the proper motions range from 2.7 to 11.4  mas  yr@xmath5 or from 5 to 23  km  s@xmath5 ( table [ tab - proper ] ) .",
    "similar to the previous reports @xcite the supermaser features are elongated along the northwest - southeast direction perpendicular to the low - velocity outflow @xcite . observed proper motions with respect to source  i are almost perpendicular to the major axis of each feature .",
    "the size of the maser spot at the peak channel on the maximum epoch , 2012/164 , is 2.265@xmath110.014  mas@xmath210.950@xmath110.006  mas",
    "( 0.95  au@xmath210.40  au ) obtained from a gaussian fitting on the self - calibrated image .",
    "the peak flux density is ( 1.029@xmath110.010)@xmath22  jy , corresponding to the brightness temperature of 1.2@xmath23  k. the isotropic luminosity is estimated to be 2.4@xmath2110@xmath24 by assuming a linewidth of 0.6  km  s@xmath5 .      to study physical and chemical properties of the supermaser , we utilize alma cycle  0 data to make images of submillimeter continuum emissions and molecular lines at band  7 .",
    "first , we have searched for any 321.225656  ghz h@xmath0o line signal toward the compact ridge where the supermaser resides for the 321.20 - 321.25  ghz range , as shown in figure [ fig - alma ] .",
    "several spectral lines are seen , but they are identified as the hcooch@xmath1 lines . if the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line is excited by the maser action like that at 22  ghz , it should be much more compact than those of other molecular lines . with this in mind , we then investigate spectra of the h@xmath0o lines by using the visibility data with the baseline length longer than 100  k@xmath25 , corresponding to the angular size of the emission region of @xmath22 . as a result",
    ", we can resolve out all of the lines in the compact ridge while a significant fraction of the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line .",
    "in contrast , the broad 321  ghz h@xmath0o line is clearly seen in source  i with a double peaked profile @xcite .",
    "the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line remains in source  i even with the baselines longer than 200  k@xmath25 suggesting a compact structure @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that no clear evidence of the 321  ghz h@xmath0o maser is detected at the position of the supermaser in spite of the extraordinary strong emission of the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser .",
    "we note that in the observed spectral range a vibrationally excited ( @xmath26=1 , 5@xmath27 - 6@xmath28 ) h@xmath0o line at 336.227931  ghz is not detected in the compact ridge .",
    "non - detection of the 321  ghz and 336  ghz h@xmath0o lines implies that the physical conditions around the compact ridge are certainly different from those in source  i @xcite .",
    "we next compare the distribution of the molecular gas in the compact ridge which hosts the supermaser . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the hcooch@xmath1 line at 321.22338  ghz ( @xmath29=0 , 28@xmath30 - 27@xmath31 a ) , which is close to the frequency of the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line ( figure [ fig - alma ] ) , as a tracer of the dense molecular gas in the compact ridge @xcite . the 321.223  ghz hcooch@xmath1 line",
    "is not blended with other hcooch@xmath1 transitions unlike those at 321.229 ghz ( @xmath29=1 ) lines , and hence , it is more suitable to analyze the velocity structure of the molecular gas .",
    "figure [ fig - moment](a ) shows the moment  0 ( integrated intensity ) map of the 321.223  ghz hcooch@xmath1 line superposed on the alma band  7 continuum emission .",
    "the supermaser is located at 8  southwest of source  i and is coincident with the compact ridge .",
    "the position of the supermaser is close to the hcooch@xmath1 peak but is rather located at the edge of the hcooch@xmath1 condensation . as can be seen in the moment  1 ( peak velocity ) map in figure [ fig - moment ] ( b ) ,",
    "the velocity of the supermaser @xmath46.9 - 7.5  km  s@xmath5 is slightly blue - shifted compared with that of the hcooch@xmath1 line .",
    "furthermore , the moment  2 ( velocity width ) map in figure [ fig - moment ] ( c ) implies that the linewidth of the hcooch@xmath1 line tends to be broader around the supermaser .",
    "we stress that the velocity structure seems to change abruptly around the supermaser .",
    "these apparent velocity structures are caused by two different velocity components of the molecular gas traced by the hcooch@xmath1 line . in figure [ fig - pv ] , we can see detailed velocity structures in the compact ridge by the position - velocity diagram along the x and y axes as indicated in figure [ fig - moment ] ( a ) .",
    "it is clear that there exist two different velocity components at 7.5  km  s@xmath5 and 9.0  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "these two components were identified in the previous observations @xcite , but we can resolve both the velocity and spatial structures by higher spectral and spatial resolutions with alma .",
    "the supermaser is thought to be associated with one of them at 7.5  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , the velocity of the weak emission from the hcooch@xmath1 line in figure [ fig - pv ] ranges from @xmath46 to 12  km  s@xmath5 , although the linewidths of the hcooch@xmath1 lines are only about 1  km  s@xmath5 as shown in figure [ fig - alma ] .",
    "the velocity range of the weak hcooch@xmath1 emission is significantly broader at x=0  and y=0 , corresponding to the position of the supermaser ( see figure [ fig - pv ] ) .",
    "this is probably an evidence of a shock front at the position close to the supermaser . indeed ,",
    "possible effects of shocks in the compact ridge have been suggested by the enhancement of organic molecules such as hcooh @xcite , hcooch@xmath1 @xcite , and ch@xmath1och@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig - cont ] shows a close - up view of distributions of the alma band  7 continuum emission superposed on the integrated intensity map of the 321.223  ghz hcooch@xmath1 line ( figure [ fig - moment](a ) ) .",
    "positions of the 22  ghz h@xmath0o masers @xcite including that of the supermaser are also indicated .",
    "we detect the compact continuum emission both at alma bands  6 and 7 @xcite .",
    "the accurate position of the supermaser is significantly shifted from the continuum peak by 0.3  southeast .",
    "we also indicate positions of other possible counterparts observed previously .",
    "their relationship will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this paper , we report results of continued monitoring observations of the supermaser with vera for more than 5  years .",
    "we also acquire follow - up observational data with alma of submillimeter continuum emissions and h@xmath0o lines at 321  ghz to reveal characteristics of the supermaser and their environments . in this section",
    ", we will address following issues related to the supermaser : what is the powering source of the supermaser and what makes the 6.9 and 7.5  km  s@xmath5 features in the compact ridge only such a special burst event ? why there is no bursting h@xmath0o maser feature at 321  ghz despite the extraordinary high flux density in the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser ? how the drastic burst of the h@xmath0o maser can be explained ?",
    "is there a periodicity of the burst event ?      according to the absolute position of the supermaser derived from our vera observations , we propose that the supermaser would be excited in the shocked molecular gas interacting between the low - velocity outflow driven by source  i and ambient dense gas in the compact ridge @xcite .",
    "proper motions and elongations of the supermaser features ( figure [ fig - map ] ) and the broader hcooch@xmath1 line at the position of the supermaser ( figure [ fig - pv ] ) support this scenario .",
    "it has also been suggested by the fact that the h@xmath0o maser tends to be distributed in the interface of the shocked molecular gas in the compact ridge traced by hcooh @xcite and hcooch@xmath1 @xcite lines .",
    "furthermore , @xcite point out a possible relation between the compact ridge and an explosive outflow traced by the co lines @xcite .",
    "indeed , the supermaser is found to be located at the edge of the low - velocity bipolar molecular outflow traced by the thermal sio lines @xcite as well as the explosive outflow @xcite .",
    "the latter one is thought to be the result of a recent close encounter of source  i and bn object @xcite , although a relationship between these two outflows is still unclear .",
    "note that an infrared source irc  5 is located at 1  southeast of the supermaser .",
    "the position of irc  5 corresponds to a nearby 3  mm continuum peak , c29 @xcite , and an hcooch@xmath1 peak , mf14 @xcite and hence , it is more closely related to these sources . since irc  5 is thought to be a shocked molecular gas heated externally @xcite , it would not be directly related to the excitation of the supermaser .",
    "alternatively , both of them are thought to be heated by the common outflow .    as discussed previously @xcite , however , it has been still unknown why only the 6.9  km  s@xmath5 and 7.5  km  s@xmath5 features show such an extraordinary burst phenomenon .",
    "one of the possible explanations is a special physical or geometrical condition of the maser excitation in this region .",
    "an anomalous amplification of the h@xmath0o maser burst might need a long path length .",
    "such a condition could be achieved only in the systemic velocity component . because it can supply plenty of ambient molecular gas within a narrow velocity range",
    ", maser emission would be efficiently amplified only close to the systemic velocity @xcite .",
    "millimeter and submillimeter continuum emissions are detected by @xcite , smm1 in @xcite and cb1 in @xcite with spatial resolution of @xmath40.8 - 3 .",
    "the mass of the submillimeter core in the compact ridge is estimated to be 4@xmath32 @xcite , and hence , they could provide the dense gas required to form new stars .",
    "a similar conclusion is obtained from the alma science verification continuum data that have been analyzed by @xcite .    to account for a necessary condition for the supermaser",
    ", it is also suggested that the maser burst could occur as a result of an interaction with outflows and a pre - existing yso in the compact ridge @xcite . as discussed in detail by @xcite",
    ", there are possible candidate sources physically associated with the supermaser ; a radio continuum source labeled r detected with vla @xcite , 3  mm continuum emission sources detected with the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) @xcite , molecular peaks traced by hcooch@xmath1 lines with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) @xcite , and optical source parenago  1822 , which is also identified from millimeter , near infrared , optical and x - ray ( see simbad ) , in the compact ridge ( figure [ fig - cont ] ) .",
    "@xcite detect a compact 1.3  mm continuum source named hc  438 in the compact ridge with a flux density of 67.8@xmath1114.2  mjy by using carma .",
    "we also detect a compact continuum source at alma band  7 ( see contours in the middle of figure [ fig - cont ] ) which is also detected at band  6 @xcite .",
    "these observations achieve much higher spatial resolution of @xmath40.5  than those reported above @xcite .",
    "the flux density at alma bands  6 and 7 are 57@xmath115  mjy and 129@xmath1114  mjy , respectively @xcite .",
    "the alma band  6 result is consistent with that of the carma 230  ghz observation @xcite .",
    "the supermaser is located within the submillimeter core detected by alma but is shifted by 0.3  from the peak position . taking into account positional uncertainties , they are identical to hc  438 @xcite , the 3  mm continuum source c32 @xcite and hcooch@xmath1 peak mf1 @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar mass of hc  438 is derived to be 0.085  @xmath32 with the assumed dust temperature of 20  k @xcite . if we assume a higher temperature of 100  k derived from the hcooch@xmath1 data @xcite , the smaller mass of 0.01@xmath32 is obtained .",
    "these mass estimates would be a lower limit of the dust continuum source possibly associated with the supermaser because most of the flux is filtered out by alma and carma with extended configurations .",
    "we speculate that an embedded yso associated with jet / outflow / disk @xcite would play an important role to realize special conditions required for the supermaser .",
    "we notice that the h@xmath0o maser features near the supermaser detected with vla @xcite are distributed around the submillimeter continuum peak as seen in figure [ fig - cont ] .",
    "it may imply an expanding shell ejected by an embedded yso , which are sometimes seen in massive ysos @xcite . as discussed in section [ sec - vera ] , we tried to search for other maser features in orion  kl region previously detected with vla @xcite .",
    "we made channel maps of the h@xmath0o maser features with vera within an 1@xmath211  field of view around the supermaser in the compact ridge .",
    "however , we found no maser emission because of the limited dynamic range seriously affected by the extremely strong supermaser .",
    "further observations of continuum emission and h@xmath0o masers with higher dynamic range will unveil the exact location of the embedded yso in the compact ridge .",
    "it is proposed that the pumping mechanism of the h@xmath0o maser is dominated by collisional excitation @xcite .",
    "the burst of the h@xmath0o maser in orion  kl is proposed as the result of collisional pumping in the magnetohydrodynamic shock wave caused by the outflow @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "alternative mechanisms are also considered to account for the extraordinary h@xmath0o maser burst , such as overlapping of two maser gas clumps @xcite and accidental beaming of radiation toward the earth rather than a change in excitation @xcite . to constrain the physical properties of the supermaser ,",
    "we have carried out observations of the submillimeter h@xmath0o lines which could be masing @xcite by using alma . among a number of h@xmath0o lines ,",
    "we employ the 10@xmath33 - 9@xmath34 transition at 321  ghz which is proposed to be a good indicator of some key parameters including temperature , density , and h@xmath0o abundance in the masing gas clump @xcite .    however , there is no significant emission of the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line at the position around the supermaser .",
    "the upper limit of the flux density of the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line is @xmath40.1  jy .",
    "if we assume physical properties of the masing gas are common for both the 22  ghz and 321  ghz lines , then a photon luminosity ratio , @xmath35(22  ghz)/@xmath35(321  ghz ) , is identical to the observed flux density ratio , @xmath18(22  ghz)/@xmath18(321  ghz ) .",
    "then , an upper limit of @xmath35(22  ghz)/@xmath35(321  ghz)@xmath310@xmath6 is obtained from the flux density of the 22  ghz maser of @xmath310@xmath15  jy . when the beaming angle of the 22  ghz maser is also the same as that of 321  ghz , an emissivity ratio @xmath36(22  ghz)/@xmath37(321  ghz ) @xcite is also equal to the photon luminosity ratio and flux density ratio , @xmath38 .    as demonstrated in the model calculations @xcite , the lower limit of @xmath38",
    "can be achieved when the temperature is @xmath4200 - 400  k or the parameter @xmath39 is @xmath40.4 - 1.8 depending on the temperature within the calculated range below 2000  k ( see their figure 3 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41(h@xmath0o )  @xmath42/@xmath43 , in which @xmath44(h@xmath0o ) , @xmath45 , and @xmath43 are a fractional abundance of h@xmath0o relative to hydrogen nuclei in units of 10@xmath46 , a number density of hydrogen nuclei in units of 10@xmath47  @xmath48 , and a velocity gradient in units of 10@xmath49  cm  s@xmath5  cm@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we note that the model employed here is calculated under the assumption of a saturated maser @xcite and hence , the estimated parameters may be different from an unsaturated case as adopted for the supermaser .",
    "furthermore , the model calculation only considers collisional pumping of h@xmath0o molecules ignoring infrared pumping .",
    "in addition , the collision rates used in these works are now superseded by newer calculations @xcite . despite these uncertainties ,",
    "we use the model of @xcite to roughly interpret the supermaser burst at 22  ghz and the non - detection of the 321  ghz line . as a result , we find the supermaser burst at 22  ghz and the non - detection at 321  ghz could still be explained by the theoretical model @xcite without extraordinary physical conditions .",
    "thus , under the condition of the unsaturated 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser , the lower temperature and larger value of @xmath40 would also be expected according to a qualitative consideration .",
    "to explain the non - detection of the 321  ghz maser line ( high value of @xmath51 ) , either high h@xmath0o abundance , high h@xmath0 density , small velocity gradient , or low temperature of 200 - 400  k would be required .",
    "the h@xmath0o abundance in the compact ridge is estimated from the herschel data to be 2.6@xmath2110@xmath52 with the source size of 6  @xcite .",
    "if a local abundance enhancement occurs around the supermaser , the higher h@xmath0o abundance up to 6.5@xmath2110@xmath46 as observed in the hot core region @xcite may be possible .",
    "the average h@xmath0 number density of the dust continuum source in the compact ridge is estimated to be ( 0.5 - 5)@xmath2110@xmath47  @xmath48 assuming a diameter ( fwhm ) of 0.43  or 90  au @xcite and a total mass of 0.01 - 0.1  @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "if we assume a velocity width of 0.6  km  s@xmath5 and a path length of 1  au as obtained from a gaussian fitting for a bursting maser spot , the velocity gradient @xmath43 is calculated to be 0.4 .",
    "although the above results contain large uncertainties by a factor of 10 or more , these parameters seem reasonable to explain estimated range of @xmath39 of 0.4 - 1.8 unless the h@xmath0o abundance is the lowest estimate of @xmath44(h@xmath0o)=0.026 @xcite .",
    "it is also conceivable that the supermaser is the result of strong beaming effects @xcite .",
    "if only the 22  ghz maser emission has a smaller beaming angle compared with that of the 321  ghz line , the emissivity ratio @xmath53 is proportional to the flux density ratio , @xmath18(22  ghz)/@xmath18(321  ghz ) , and the ratio of beaming angles , @xmath54(22  ghz)/@xmath54(321  ghz ) , which reduces the upper limit of @xmath53 estimated from the observed flux density ratio .",
    "the smaller beaming angle of the 22  ghz maser line than that of 321  ghz by a factor of @xmath4100 would enable a large @xmath54(22  ghz)/@xmath54(321  ghz ) value of @xmath410000 .",
    "this may result in the lower @xmath53 value by a factor of 10000 which can be achieved under wider range of physical conditions as seen in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "in spite of the presence or absence of a beaming effect , the condition for the h@xmath0o maser burst only at the 22  ghz transition , @xmath38 , does not require extreme physical properties but rather those typical in hot molecular cores @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the symmetric time variation in the flux density ( figure [ fig - flux ] ) could be explained by a change in the beaming angle of the maser rather than changes in the physical properties such as h@xmath0o abundance , h@xmath0 density , and/or temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "a change in a velocity gradient caused by a length of the maser cloud and/or velocity structure might happen such as those in the overlapping maser model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is still uncertain how such an accidental overlapping and/or a beaming effect could occur in two spatially distinct clouds for several times during our monitoring period of @xmath45 years .      comparing the basic properties such as the peak lsr velocity , the spatial structure of each feature , and the location coincident with the compact ridge , all of the burst events in 1979 - 1985 , 1998 - 1999 , and 2011 - 2012 could have a common origin .",
    "it is also suggested that the h@xmath0o maser burst may have periodicity of 13  years @xcite .",
    "however , the current burst shows less activities in terms of the maximum flux density .",
    "furthermore , no such burst event is reported in 1973 @xcite , in which the burst event is expected if 13  year - periodicity is valid ( i.e. 1972 - 1973 , 1979 - 1985 , 1998 - 1999 , and 2011 - 2012 ) . in 1973",
    "july , the observed flux density of the h@xmath0o maser at 7.4  km  s@xmath5 was only about 100  jy and was weaker than the 11.0  km  s@xmath5 component @xcite .",
    "this component was probably identical to the second brightest component in the current burst phase ( figure [ fig - sp ] ) .",
    "the position of the 7.4  km  s@xmath5 component was measured to be r.a.=05h35m14.22s and decl.=-05@xmath552237.0 ( j2000 ) and was consistent with that of the current bursting feature located in the compact ridge . in 1975 - 1976 ,",
    "the h@xmath0o maser feature at 7.6  km  s@xmath5 was detected at the position of r.a.=05h35m14.07s and decl.=-05@xmath55d2238.0 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the position of this feature was again in good agreement with that of the current h@xmath0o maser burst , whereas it was rather weak ( much less than 1000  jy ) compared with another strong feature at 10.8  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "although the h@xmath0o maser feature at @xmath47.5  km  s@xmath5 could be excited by a common origin in the compact ridge , it is not very likely that the maser burst occurs regularly at a period of 13  years .",
    "more archive data of past observations will be helpful to investigate a long - term variability of the h@xmath0o maser activities since early 1970s .",
    "the flux increase started in 2013 is now on - going and hence , further monitoring will also provide some hints to understand a possible relation with previous bursts .",
    "along with the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser lines , it could be useful to continue monitoring observations of the 321  ghz h@xmath0o lines in orion  kl with alma in order to see whether the compact ridge and source  i , which is a powering source of the outflow interacting with the compact ridge , behave in the same way .",
    "figures [ fig - sp]-[fig - flux ] imply that the current burst in 2011 and 2012 sometimes shows variations in the flux density and velocity structure with the timescales of 2 - 7  months .",
    "it is comparable to those of typical h@xmath0o masers in orion  kl @xcite .",
    "although the spectral component of the supermaser seems to survive for more than 5 - 10  years @xcite , a spatial structure of each bursting feature is found to be changing within a timescale of a few months to @xmath22  years at the longest lifetime ( table [ tab - proper ] ) .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the bulk of the bursting maser gas is identical for longer than @xmath42  years .",
    "we have carried out astrometric monitoring observations of the bursting 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser feature , called supermaser , in orion  kl using vera since 2011 march . combined with spectral line data obtained as a fringe - finder ,",
    "we reveal a time variation of the supermaser for more than 5  years .",
    "in addition , we utilize alma cycle  0 data at band  7 ( 320 - 330  ghz ) for both spectral lines and continuum emissions to investigate physical and chemical properties of the supermaser . the main findings are summarized as follows :    1 .   within the monitoring period in 2011 and 2012",
    ", we detect three active phases with rising and falling timescales ranging from 2 to 7  months .",
    "we also find a smaller burst in 2009 with a slightly longer rising and falling timescales of @xmath410  months .",
    "the flux variations of the supermaser seem to be symmetric in time for all of the active phases . 2 .",
    "the maximum phase of the current burst is observed on 2012/154 with the total flux density of 135000  jy , which is one order of magnitude lower than those in previous bursts .",
    "although the burst events may occur with a possible periodicity of 13  years , ( i.e. 1979 - 1985 , 1998 - 1999 , and 2011 - 2012 ) , a lower flux density by a factor of 10 in the current burst , as well as no significant burst event in 1973 @xcite would make the claimed periodicity of 13  years still unconvincing .",
    "the outburst of the maser emission can be seen in two velocity components at @xmath46.9  km  s@xmath5 and @xmath47.5  km  s@xmath5 as reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the 6.9  km  s@xmath5 feature is alive only in 2011 with the lifetime of @xmath48  months .",
    "note that we detect two spatially distinct features at 6.9  km  s@xmath5 and 7.5  km  s@xmath5 , and hence , these two velocity components are unlikely due to the hyperfine structure of the h@xmath0o molecule .",
    "4 .   the flux density and linewidth show an anti - correlation as expected for an unsaturated maser emission @xcite , in which the logarithm of the flux density of the maser line , @xmath12 , is proportional to the inverse square of the linewidth , @xmath13 .",
    "however , we can not rule out a possibility of a saturated maser case because such a line narrowing is also predicted to occur even for a saturated maser if a stimulated emission rate is not large compared with that of the cross - relaxation @xcite .",
    "as reported in previous papers @xcite the bursting maser features are elongated along the northwest - southeast direction perpendicular to the low - velocity outflow driven by source  i. absolute proper motions of the bursting maser features are measured based on a longer monitoring period than that in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "their proper motions with respect to a powering source of the low - velocity outflow , source  i , are almost perpendicular to the elongation of the maser features , suggesting that they are related to the low - velocity outflow .",
    "the size of the maser spot at the peak channel on the maximum epoch , 2012/164 , is 2.265  mas@xmath210.950  mas , and the total flux density is 1.029@xmath2110@xmath15  jy .",
    "these values correspond to the brightness temperature and the isotropic luminosity of 1.2@xmath23  k and 2.4@xmath2110@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the supermaser is located at the compact ridge region in orion  kl .",
    "continuum peaks detected by alma bands  6 and 7 are located 0.3  northwest of the supermaser . as suggested by @xcite",
    ", there are a radio continuum source labeled r @xcite , 3  mm continuum source c32 @xcite , hcooch@xmath1 core mf1 @xcite , and optical source parenago  1822 , which are probably identical or closely related to the compact continuum sources detected by alma and the supermaser .",
    "the position of the supermaser is coincident with the dense gas traced by the hcooch@xmath1 line .",
    "the velocity of the supermaser agrees well with one of the two velocity components of the hcooch@xmath1 line detected by alma and pdbi @xcite .",
    "a slightly broader velocity range of the weak hcooch@xmath1 emission would imply a shock front at the position of the supermaser .",
    "the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line is not detected around the 22  ghz supermaser features , although the strong maser emission is found to be associated with source  i @xcite .",
    "given the high emissivity ratio , the maser burst at 22  ghz could occur under conditions of the temperature of @xmath2200 - 400  k and/or the parameter @xmath56 , suggesting a high abundance of h@xmath0o , a high number density of h@xmath0 , and/or a small velocity gradient .",
    "meanwhile , these physical properties are not extraordinary values but are very similar to typical hot molecular cloud cores .",
    "thus , the supermaser burst at 22  ghz with non - detection of the 321  ghz maser emission could be explained by the theoretical model qualitatively @xcite .",
    "further detailed calculations would be required to interpret the observed flux ratios of the masers @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the supermaser may be caused by an accidental beaming only for the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser @xcite .",
    "the symmetric time variation in the flux density is consistent with a result of the beaming rather than changes in physical properties of the masing gas .",
    "however , it still remains a matter of debate how accidental overlapping and/or beaming occur repetitively for more than @xmath430  years since the discovery of the supermaser .",

    "<S> the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser in orion  kl has shown extraordinary burst events in 1979 - 1985 and 1998 - 1999 , sometimes called supermaser . </S>",
    "<S> we have conducted monitoring observations of the supermaser in orion  kl using vera , vlbi exploration of radio astrometry , in the current third burst since 2011 march . </S>",
    "<S> three flux maxima are detected in 2011 and 2012 with rising and falling timescales of 2 - 7  months . </S>",
    "<S> time variations of the supermaser seem symmetric for all of the active phases . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum total flux density of 135000  jy is observed in 2012 june while it is still one order of magnitude lower than those in previous bursts . </S>",
    "<S> the supermaser consists of two spatially different components at different velocities . </S>",
    "<S> they are elongated along a northwest - southeast direction perpendicular to the low - velocity outflow driven by source  i. proper motions of the supermaser features with respect to source  i are measured toward west and southwest directions , almost parallel to the low - velocity outflow . </S>",
    "<S> the flux density and linewidth show an anti - correlation as expected for an unsaturated maser emission . </S>",
    "<S> the supermaser is located close to the methylformate ( hcooch@xmath1 ) line and continuum emission peaks in the orion compact ridge detected by alma , atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array . </S>",
    "<S> the broader velocity range of the weak hcooch@xmath1 emission at the supermaser position would be an evidence of a shock front . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line is not detected at the position of the supermaser . </S>",
    "<S> it can be explained qualitatively by one of the theoretical h@xmath0o excitation models without extraordinary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> our results support a scenario that the supermaser is excited in the dense gas interacting with the low - velocity outflow in the compact ridge . </S>",
    "<S> the extremely high flux density and its symmetric time variation for rising and falling phases could be explained by a beaming effect during the amplification process rather than changes in physical conditions . </S>"
