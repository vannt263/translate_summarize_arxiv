    "theoretical as well as experimental studies have indicated that many complex systems under the influence of stochastic perturbations can undergo sudden `` regime shifts '' in which they abruptly shift to a contrasting state .",
    "such shifts may occur in systems with alternative stable states @xcite .",
    "well studied examples of regime shifts include sudden collapse of ecosystems @xcite , the onset of collapse in mutualistic communities @xcite , abrupt climatic shifts @xcite , the crash of markets in global finance @xcite , systemic failures such as the epileptic seizures @xcite and even the eruptive events in spreading fires @xcite . despite rich advances in the theory of complex systems , understanding the mechanism which trigger the onset of regime shifts in nature remains a challenge .",
    "there are mainly two types of regime shifts that can occur in systems with alternative stable states .",
    "one is _ critical transition _ which is associated with the _ bifurcation points _ ( so called tipping points ) @xcite and another is _ noise induced transition _ ( also known as stochastic switching ) @xcite .",
    "much effort has been devoted in recent years in developing _ early warning signals _ of impending regime shifts between alternative stable states @xcite .",
    "such early warning signals can have tremendous impact on managing natural systems by forewarning the systems under the threat of state shift , so that appropriate management strategies can be initiated to prevent a catastrophe .",
    "recent progress in this direction suggests that a set of generic statistical indicators ( e.g. , increase in variance , autocorrelation ) may forewarn an impending transition in a wide range of complex systems @xcite .",
    "a recent review on `` dynamical disease '' argued that an early detection of regime shifts even in the field of medical sciences , such as in cardiac arrhythmia s could be of some help to prevent sudden death @xcite .",
    "however , these signals are mostly developed for the phenomenon of critical slowing down that arises in the vicinity of tipping points @xcite .",
    "for purely noise induced transitions , such as we also examine in this paper , there is an active debate about whether early warning signals can really be useful @xcite .    in genetic regulatory systems",
    ", it is known that random cell - to - cell variations within a genetically identical population can lead to regime shifts between alternative stable states of gene expression ( i.e. , sudden transition in protein concentration ) @xcite .",
    "when the underlying genetic system contains regulatory positive feedback loops , individual cells can exist in different steady states @xcite .",
    "some cells may , for example , live in the `` off '' expression state of a particular gene , whereas others are in the `` on '' expression state @xcite .",
    "these stochastic fluctuations in gene expression , commonly referred to as noise , have been proposed to cause transitions between these states @xcite .",
    "a well known example of bistable gene expression with coupled stochastic transition is the induction of the _ lac _ operon in _ e. coli _ which results in the synthesis of protein _ @xmath0-galactosidase _ required for breaking up sugar molecules and releasing energy to the cell @xcite . experimental study on _ @xmath0-galactosidase _ shows that sudden transition from unregulated ( low level ) to regulated ( high level ) _",
    "@xmath0-galactosidase _ state of lac operon occurs at a critical point of an inducer concentration @xcite .",
    "a potential application of early warning signals in gene expression is to identify increased risk of sudden transitions in protein concentration and prevent complex disease onset @xcite .",
    "recently the concept of regime shifts with associated early warning signals has been used in systems medicine @xcite .",
    "the expectation is to foresee a sudden catastrophic shift in health condition which may result in a extreme transition to a disease state .",
    "now a days it is believed that a detailed understanding of regime shifts in disease onset will provide broad applications in the field of medicine @xcite .",
    "already detected sudden transitions in medical science include epileptic seizures @xcite , depression @xcite , pulmonary disease @xcite , diabetes mellitus @xcite , etc . for the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus , _",
    "@xmath0-cells _ in the pancreas do not produce protein hormone _ insulin _ , which sometimes is a consequence of `` switched off '' state of hla - encoding genes in the cell ( `` switched on '' state of genes in @xmath0-cell corresponds to activation of insulin production ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that genes carry the instructions that cells use for protein production .",
    "hence , bistability via `` switching on '' or `` off '' states in `` gene expression '' is also an important topic to study for regime shifts in systems medicine @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study a stochastic version of bistable gene regulatory positive feedback loop model @xcite to explore the robustness of early warning indicators of regime shifts , for both cases , the critical transition and noise induced transition .",
    "we investigate the effect of additive and multiplicative noise intensities , and cross correlation intensity between two noises on the model by calculating the probability density and potential function.we find that increasing the intensity of additive noise induces regime shifts from low to high protein concentration state and vice versa for an increase in multiplicative noise intensity . whereas an increase in the cross correlation intensity from a negative to a positive value between the two noises induce regime shifts from high to low protein concentration state .",
    "we also compute mean first passage time ( mfpt ) for escape over the potential barrier .",
    "we discuss how one can regulate the production levels of protein . to this end",
    ", we apply the early warning signals of regime shifts @xcite on the simulated time series data of the stochastic model to examine how successfully one can forewarn regime shifts . our work presents a novel framework for using early warning signals to identify regime shifts , and also their key limitations , in a gene regulatory system .",
    "finally , in the discussion section , we conclude the paper with a discussion of the main results together with the applicability and importance of our study .",
    "it is well known that autoactivating positive feedback loop is one of the simplest circuit motifs able to exhibit bistable states in gene regulatory process @xcite . in the circuit ,",
    "a single gene encodes a transcriptional factor activator ( tf - a ) , and the tf - a activates its own transcription when bind to a responsive element ( tf - re ) in the dna sequence ( see fig .",
    "[ sch ] for a schematic representation ) .",
    "the transcription factor activator tf - a is referred to as regulatory protein , is used to control genetic regulation and acts as a pathway mediating a cellular response to a stimulus .",
    "the tf - a constructs a homodimer which then binds to tf - re or dna regulatory site .",
    "gene incorporates a tf - re and when homodimers bind to the tf - re , transcription of tf - a is increased .",
    "homodimer binding to responsive element is independent phosphorylation of dimers .",
    "however , transcription can be activated only by phosphorylated tf - a dimers .",
    "some dimers phosphorylation will depend on activity of kinases and phosphatases which is controlled by external signals .",
    "hence , this genetic circuit incorporates signal - activated transcription as well as positive feedback on tf - a synthesis .",

    "some other limitations include size of the window which varies across the literature and how much data are required for analyzing ews is still not clear .",
    "moreover , variance is a robust indicator as compared to autocorrelation in the case of csd and this is due to the fact that autocorrelation is affected by the length of time series ( see appendix s2 for more details ) and more sensitive to false alarms . in the case of stochastic switching",
    ", anticipating regime shifts is more difficult due to sudden transitions .",
    "the significance of these findings are discussed in the discussion section below .",
    "in this paper , we investigated a stochastic genetic regulatory circuit using analytical techniques and numerical simulation to anticipate regime shifts in protein concentration . in this respect , we derived an approximate fokker - planck equation from the langevin equation .",
    "we studied the effects of intensity of both the additive and multiplicative external noise and their correlation on the gene regulatory system .",
    "the present study suggests that the presence of additive noise in the system induces regime shifts from a low protein concentration to a high protein concentration state , whereas multiplicative noise induces regime shifts from a high to a low protein concentration state .",
    "moreover , we also show that how a correlation between the additive and multiplicative noise is important in determining regime shifts and hence can regulate the production of protein levels .",
    "furthermore , an increase in the cross correlation intensity from a negative to a positive value between the two noises induce regime shifts from high to low protein concentration state . here",
    "we have also computed the robustness of steady states using the mfpt @xcite .",
    "our mfpt result uncovers the fact that an increase in mfpt of right potential well with the maximum production rate promotes regime shifts from left potential well to the right potential well and vice versa for an increase in the cross correlation intensity .",
    "in addition , we used a recently developed tool ( http://www.early-warning-signals.org/ ) of early warning signals to anticipate regime shifts in the considered gene regulatory system using simulated time series data for both the csd and ss .",
    "extensive literature on regime shifts is available for ecosystems , financial markets , climatic shifts , etc .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there is very less work available on anticipating regime shifts in many areas of developmental biology , specifically in genetic regulation @xcite .",
    "here for the first time , for a genetic regulatory system , we used the time series analysis based ews approach to predict upcoming regime shifts .",
    "as anticipated by some previous authors @xcite , we also find that the ews of raising variance and autocorrelation are in general sensitive to false alarms and not always successful to reliably predict impending state shifts in our model .",
    "we found that the ews are moderately more successful when we analyzed time series data in advance to a state shift in the case of csd , whereas in the case of ss , it is specific to particular noise only .",
    "we observed some key limitations and statistical issues of ews , such as false pick in data , size of the window and length of time series data . for our model , we also verified that rising variance appears as a robust indicator of csd as compared to lag-@xmath84 autocorrelation .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that autocorrelation is sensitive to the length of time series .",
    "for accurate estimation of autocorrelation , we need long and equidistant time series data which are not always available for real systems . however , variance is insensitive to this effect and as a result , measuring autocorrelation as ews may increase the possibility of false alarms . while testing ews to our simulated time series data , we also observed that selection of window size is another major problem for getting a positive signal of regime shifts .",
    "in the case of ss , anticipation of regime shifts is extremely difficult because a bifurcation point is neither approached nor crossed and there is suddenly a phase transition .",
    "anticipating regime shifts in gene regulatory system ( aka in protein concentration level ) can be useful to prevent disease onset and progression which may intercept unacceptable sudden transitions from a healthy state to a disease state @xcite .",
    "examples of such regime shifts are asthma attacks , epileptic seizures and sudden deterioration of complex diseases @xcite . a well documented example of regime shift is type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) which is a form of diabetes mellitus @xcite .",
    "t1d is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by insufficient production of insulin by @xmath0 cells in the pancreas .",
    "the genetic association of t1d is that the production of insulin through @xmath0 cells depends on hla - encoding genes @xcite .",
    "if t1d associated genes are in `` on '' expression state , then @xmath0 cells produce insulin and releases insulin into the blood stream , but if they are in `` off '' expression state @xmath0 cells fail to produce insulin which leads to t1d . prediction of regime shifts in gene expression using ews from normal ( `` on '' ) to diabetic ( `` off '' ) state could prevent the switch to diabetic state and help to maintain the level of insulin .    in summary , our work reveals that stochasticity can have diverse complex effects on genetic regulatory systems .",
    "early warning signals to anticipate forthcoming regime shifts in gene expression requires special attention to the underlying various statistical issues and limitations .",
    "in addition , to select a suitable window size and data length raise further difficulties .",
    "the main challenge of detecting early warning signals includes risk of false alarms and failed detections .",
    "one needs a deeper understanding of early warning signals of regime shifts , and how a balance between early warning signals and false alarms is achieved , will lead to important new insights in genetic regulation .",
    "moreover , our results establish the important fact that finding a more robust indicator of regime shifts in complex natural systems is still in its infancy and demands extensive research .",
    "we hope that this study may also increase the interest among researchers to find a more robust indicator for detecting upcoming sudden transition in much broader class of systems in developmental biology .",
