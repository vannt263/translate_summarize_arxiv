    "it has now become fairly well established that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion in recent times ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "observational evidence for this mainly comes from supernovae ia @xcite and cosmic microwave background anisotropies @xcite .",
    "large scale structure formation @xcite , baryon oscillations @xcite and weak lensing @xcite also suggest such an accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "one of the most challenging problems of modern cosmology is to identify the cause of this late time acceleration .",
    "many theoretical approaches have been employed to explain the phenomenon of late time cosmic acceleration . a positive cosmological",
    "constant can lead to accelerated expansion of the universe but it is plagued by the fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant may either be interpreted geometrically as modifying the left hand side of einstein s equation or as a kinematic term on the right hand side with the equation of state parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the second approach can further be generalized by considering a source term with an equation of state parameter @xmath3 .",
    "such kinds of source terms have collectively come to be known as dark energy .",
    "various scalar field models of dark energy have been considered in literature @xcite . as an alternative to dark energy as a source for the accelerated expansion , modification of the gravity part of the action",
    "has also been attempted @xcite . in these models , in addition to the scalar curvature @xmath4 in the gravity lagrangian there is an additional term @xmath5 .",
    "the gravity action hence becomes , @xmath6,\\ ] ] however , in such models matter and gravity are still minimally coupled . despite the significant literature on such @xmath5 models @xcite , another interesting possibility which has not received due attention until recent times is a non -minimum coupling between the scalar curvature and the matter lagrangian density @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we study the evolution of hubble parameter in minimal and non - minimal coupling between scalar curvature and the matter lagrangian density .",
    "we use a form for @xmath5 model which assumes the following exponential form proposed by linder @xcite : @xmath7 \\label{lind_r}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 being the model parameter and @xmath9 is the present day curvature scale . we also attempt to place observational constraints on the parameters of this model in both minimal and non - minimal coupling of scalar curvature with matter lagrangian density . we find that there is an upper bound on model parameter @xmath8 in the minimal coupling case . for non - minimal coupling between matter and gravity , there is a range of values which the parameter @xmath8 is allowed to take .",
    "these bounds depend on the present day value of @xmath10 that we use .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ fr ] we introduce the most general action for modified gravity .",
    "the equations of motions corresponding to this action are solved numerically for both minimal and non - minimal coupling of scalar curvature with matter .",
    "we investigate the observational constraints on the model parameter in section [ obscon ] . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we summarize the results .",
    "we start with the general action for modified gravity where the curvature is in general coupled with the matter lagrangian :    @xmath12{\\cal{l}}_{m}\\right ] , \\label{action}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the arbitrary functions of ricci scalar @xmath4 and @xmath15 is the lagrangian density for matter which we will assume to be non - relativistic . we assume the natural unit with the speed of light taken to be unity in our calculations .",
    "the standard einstein - hilbert action is recovered with @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the standard @xmath5 gravity class of models are recovered with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath5 is an arbitrary function of @xmath4 . in the latter case",
    "the pure gravity action has a non - minimal coupling while the matter is still minimally coupled to gravity . in what follows , we shall consider the cosmological evolutions and their observational constraints for modified gravity models in both cases , namely , one in which the curvature is coupled minimally as well as the one in which the curvature is non - minimally coupled with the matter lagrangian density .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     where subscript `` @xmath21 '' denotes differentiation with respect to variable @xmath21 .",
    "the initial conditions are also taken in a way similar to the one described in the minimally coupled case in the previous section .",
    "the evolution of the hubble parameter is shown in figure 3 .",
    "unlike the minimally coupled case , we do not have pathological behaviour for any values of the parameter @xmath22 . to compare the",
    "minimally coupled and non - minimally couple cases , we show the behaviour of the hubble parameter for the two case for same values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in figure 4 .",
    "it shows that hubble parameter in the non - minimally coupled case evolves slower than its counterpart in the minimally coupled case .",
    "we also show the behaviour of the deceleration parameter for nonminimally coupled case in figure 5 . here",
    "also the universe is in an accelerating phase at present and smoothly joins the decelerating regime in the past . here unlike the minimally coupled case ,",
    "higher the value of the parameter @xmath22 , the universe enters the acceleration regime earlier .",
    "in this section we investigate the observational constraints on our model parameters .",
    "we use the supernova type ia data from the latest union2 dataset consisting of 557 data point @xcite .",
    "the data consists of the distance modulus defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the luminosity distance defined as , @xmath27 the other data we consider is the baryon acoustic oscillations scale produced in the decoupling surface by the interplay between the pressure of the baryon - photon fluid and gravity . for this",
    "we calculate the distance ratio @xmath28 where @xmath29 is given by    @xmath30^{1/3}.\\ ] ]    the sdss observation gives @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we use this measurements together with the measurements of distance modulus by type ia supernova observations , to constrain our model .",
    "we use these two observational data to put constraints on our model parameter . in figure 6 , we show the @xmath32 and @xmath33 contours in the @xmath34 plane with different choices of the density paremeter @xmath35 . for minimally coupled case , there is always an upper bound for the parameter @xmath22 as well as for the present day decceleration parameter @xmath24 .",
    "for example , with @xmath36 the @xmath33 upper bound for @xmath22 is around 1.8 .",
    "this upper bound shifts towards higher values as one increases @xmath35 . on the other hand , for non -",
    "minimally coupled case , things are different . here",
    "there is an allowed range of @xmath22 for every values of @xmath24 .",
    "for example , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the @xmath33 allowed range for @xmath22 is between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . but as one increases @xmath35 , this range shifts towards smaller value of @xmath22 .",
    "also for the minimally coupled case , our constraint on parameter @xmath22 differs than that obtained by ali et.al @xcite they solved the evolution equation in a different way than ours .",
    "they have assumed the universe is close to @xmath41cdm at higher redshifts , and put the initial conditions in the early time whereas we put the initial condition at present and solve it backwards .",
    "also one of the initial conditions @xmath24 is actually one of the fitting parameters .",
    "also they have used the slightly older supernova data given by constitution set , which has 397 data points in comparison to our 557 data points given by the union2 set .",
    "their analysis shows no constraint on @xmath22 . at any level .",
    "it differs significantly from what we obtain .",
    "we have reinvestigated the @xmath5 gravity model where the curvature is minimally as well as in the case where gravity is non - minimally coupled with matter .",
    "we have assumed the linder s exponential form for @xmath5 for our analysis .",
    "we have fixed the initial condition at present .",
    "we do not need any additional assumptions . by definition ,",
    "@xmath42 at @xmath0 , where @xmath43 is the present day hubble parameter .",
    "the other initial condition fixes @xmath24 , the present day deceleration parameter , and we take @xmath24 as one of our fitting parameters . hence our method of solving the evolution equation does not involve any additional assumption . first we check that for minimally coupled case , for @xmath44 , one can evolve the universe till any higher redshifts without any pathological behaviour . for lower values of @xmath22",
    ", there is some singular features in @xmath45 at different redshifts depending upon the parameter choices . for nonminimally coupled case ,",
    "this changes and @xmath45 is regular till any higher redshifts for any choice of parameter values ( we have taken @xmath35 between 0.25 and 0.35 , @xmath24 between -0.9 to -0.55 and @xmath22 between 1 to 50 ) . for minimally coupled case , the constraint @xmath44 to get regular solutions for @xmath45 also satisfies the constraint coming from the local gravity tests @xcite .",
    "also the evolution of the universe is as expected , showing accelerating universe at late time , and decelerating universe in the past .",
    "we next use the the observational data coming from type ia supernova observations as well as the bao peak measurements by sdss . for supernova",
    ", we use the latest union2 compilation consisting 557 data points . for minimally coupled case ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath22 is completely different from what obtained by ali et al .",
    "@xcite earlier .",
    "we have obtained a upper bound on @xmath22 .",
    "this upper bound on @xmath22 shifts towards the higher values as one increases @xmath35 . for nonminimally coupled case",
    ", there is a range of allowed values for @xmath22 , and this allowed range for @xmath22 shifts towards for smaller values as one increases @xmath35 .",
