    "as noted in the text , for the simulations we coarse grain dna as a bead - and - spring polymer , where beads of diameter @xmath38  nm are connected by finitely extensible non - linear elastic ( fene ) springs , and interact via a purely repulsive potential [ the weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) potential  see below ] which captures steric effects .",
    "a kratky - porod potential introduces a bending stiffness such that the polymer has a persistence length @xmath39  nm . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we model searcher proteins as a pair of rigidly connected spheres , of diameter @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively [ fig .  1 in main text ] ; the larger sphere has only a steric interaction with the dna , whereas the smaller sphere interacts via a truncated lj potential such that it is sticky and acts as a dna binding site .",
    "the shifted lj potential between spheres @xmath42 and @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the separation of the beads , @xmath46 is a cut - off distance , and @xmath47,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the mean of the diameters of the spheres . here",
    "@xmath49 is an energy scale , but due to the shifting this is not the energy value at the minimum of the potential ; for clarity throughout the paper we state interaction energies at the minimum , and call this @xmath2 . a choice of @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lj ] ) gives the wca potential for steric interaction only , and a larger value of @xmath46 gives an attractive interaction ( we use a cut off which corresponds to an interaction volume which extends 1  nm from the surface of the sphere  similar to the debye length at physiological salt concentrations ) .",
    "crowders are modelled as single spheres of diameter @xmath51 ( a typical size for _ e. coli _ proteins  @xcite ) , and interact only sterically with the dna .",
    "blockers are modelled as two rigidly connected spheres , this time of diameters @xmath40 and @xmath52 .",
    "the larger of the spheres is sticky for the dna , with a strong interaction of @xmath53 .",
    "this choice means that the blockers diffuse slowly along the dna contour , and only occasionally escape from it  the blocker diffusion constant is @xmath54 and they unbind from the dna with a rate @xmath55 , compared to e.g. a searcher with @xmath23 which has @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( here @xmath58 are simulation time units which we define below ) . by allowing the dna beads to partially move inside the larger sphere the protein",
    "effectively then sits _ around _ the dna , blocking the path of the searchers from all sides . by using a two - sphere model",
    "we also prevent the blockers from interacting with multiple dna strands at the same time , for example forming dna bridges .    denoting the position of the @xmath42th sphere by @xmath59 , its dynamics obey the following langevin equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 refers to the full potential including the fene , kratky - porod and lj terms , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote respectively the mass and friction experienced by the @xmath42th particle .",
    "@xmath64 is the temperature , @xmath65 the boltzmann constant , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is an uncorrelated gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath68 .",
    "we fix the velocity relaxation time @xmath69 , and then choose @xmath63 and @xmath62 such that an isolated particle diffuses like a sphere in a fluid of viscosity @xmath70 according to the usual stokes - einstein relation @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the diameter of the particle ( i.e. for a dna bead @xmath73 ) . to map time scales to physical units",
    "we define the simulation time unit @xmath74 , and note that if @xmath75 , then one simulation time unit corresponds to @xmath76 .",
    "systems are equilibrated for at least @xmath77 time steps before the attractive interactions are switched on , so the initial dna configuration is equilibrated and protein positions are random .",
    "we also note that simulation times were in general an order of magnitude larger than e.g. the time needed for a crowder to diffuse across the system , so that any residual influence of the initial condition is lost .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions , which would vastly increase the computational cost , are omitted .",
    "all simulations were performed using the lammps code  @xcite . throughout the paper",
    "we use simulation time units , and plots show results averaged over 500 independent simulations , each considering a dna molecule of length @xmath78 in a volume @xmath79 ( leading to a 1% volume fraction of dna  similar to that in an _",
    "e. coli _ cell ) .",
    "we use a cubic simulation box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a dna molecule of this length has a gyration radius of the order @xmath80 , meaning that the dna is compacted ( although not quite as much as in a real cell  we have @xmath81 , compared to @xmath82 for _ e. coli _ ) .",
    "previous work  @xcite has shown that , althought there is little effect on overall search time , a compact globule dna conformation can lead to a decrease in the probability of 3d excursions which start and end at positions with large separation along the dna ; the dna molecules here are not long enough for this effect to become important .",
    "the choice of periodic boundaries ensures that even though the width of the system is only about twice the persistence length , no unrealistic sharp bends are induced in the dna due to confining walls .",
    "each simulation is run until the searcher protein binds to the target dna bead ( the central bead in the dna molecule ) for the first time , and the search time and number of rounds is recorded .",
    "the 1d and 3d search times are averaged over each search round , and we compute @xmath3 as the number of distinct dna beads visited during one round of 1d diffusion along dna ( these may be adjacent beads along the dna contour , or beads which are visited via intersegmental transfer ) .",
    "in a bacterial cell there may be @xmath83 copies of a given transcription factor ( e.g. there are typically 5 _ lac _ repressor tetramers in an _",
    "e. coli _ cell  @xcite ) .",
    "if the search for the target were a simple poisson process , one would expect that the mean search time should scale inversely with the number of searchers , i.e. the search time for @xmath16 searchers should be @xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig : searchers](a ) shows the search time as a function of @xmath16 for a number of different protein - dna affinities , and we see that the @xmath84 scaling holds for @xmath16 up to around 10 and @xmath85 . this result may appear to contradict recent theoretical work by sokolov et al .",
    "@xcite , which predicted an @xmath86 scaling for pure 1d diffusion ( which we might expect to be similar to the large @xmath2 regime ) . however , that study applied only in the thermodynamic limit ; lattice based simulations of pure 1d diffusion for finite @xmath5 show an exponent between @xmath87 and @xmath88 for a finite lattice with @xmath89 ( not shown ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : searchers](b ) we show separately the mean duration of the 1d and 3d search episodes , @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively .",
    "there is a significant dependence of @xmath91 on the number of searcher proteins due to steric effects ; for small @xmath2 , @xmath92 , but for large @xmath2 , @xmath93 .",
    "the latter result is due to the large number of searchers bound to the dna in this case : much of the dna is occluded by proteins , so it takes longer for a given searcher to encounter a segment of dna which is free .",
    "increasing the number of searchers has little effect on the 1d search time , except at large @xmath2 . when both @xmath16 and @xmath2 are large it is possible for the searchers to form multiple contacts with different dna segments and become trapped .",
    "some transcription factors ( although a minority ) have more than one binding site ( e.g. the _ lac _ repressor ) , and it is only to these that our data for large @xmath2 apply . for an isolated searcher protein",
    "such multiple contacts are very short lived because the lowering of free energy due to the simultaneous interaction with two dna strands does not outweigh the entropic cost of bringing the two strands close together ; such multiple contacts could be thought to model intersegmental transfers . for large @xmath2 ,",
    "if multiple searchers bridge the same dna segments , the structure is stabilised and the searchers become trapped , leading to the observed increase in @xmath21 .",
    "although here we have considered more copies of the same searcher protein than would typically occur in a single cell , the results for @xmath20 and @xmath21 would also apply in the case of many different species of searcher protein .",
    "searchers finds a target , as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "results for several different values of @xmath2 ( units of @xmath94 ) are shown , and times are scaled by the search time for a single searcher .",
    "the solid line shows @xmath95 .",
    "( b ) the mean 3d and 1d search times as a function of @xmath2 , for different values of @xmath16 , again scaled by the time for a single searcher .",
    "[ fig : searchers ] ]    finally we note that there may be some additional advantages to having multiple searchers which we have not considered .",
    "we have modelled a uniform dna molecule , whereas in reality some `` non - target '' dna sequences might have a very high affinity for protein binding and could act as traps @xcite for proteins ( although whether the proteins experience a varying potential as they slide remains controversial @xcite ) .",
    "if there are multiple copies of a protein , then any falling into such a trap , will block others from entering it .",
    "in fig .  [ crowtau](a ) we show the data from fig .",
    "3(d ) , but here the search time is rescaled by the search time observed in the absence of crowders . as detailed in the main text , despite a large change in the number of crowders ,",
    "there is a relatively small change in search time  at a 25% volume fraction the change in search time is around 20% , despite for example a @xmath96 decrease in @xmath20 and a @xmath97 increase in @xmath21 .",
    "this is due to the partial cancelling of effects , where @xmath20 decreases , and @xmath21 increases .",
    "also the fact that @xmath29 either increases or decreases depending on the value of @xmath2 can be easily seen in this plot .    .",
    "( b )  search time as a function of protein - dna interaction energy @xmath2 , for no crowders , and 25% volume fraction of crowders .",
    "[ crowtau ] ]    figure  [ crowtau](b ) shows how the search time varies with @xmath2 for the cases of no crowders , and 25% volume fraction .",
    "as detailed in the text , the overall effect of the crowders is to reduce the dependence of @xmath2 at the minimum  there is very little vaiation in @xmath29 for @xmath2 between @xmath98@xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ blocktau ] shows how the search time varies with @xmath2 for the case of no blockers , and of a blocker dna coverage fraction of @xmath99 .",
    "the presence of the blockers results in an overall increase in search time , and this increase is slightly larger for smaller @xmath2 . the search is dominated by 3d excursions at small @xmath2 ,",
    "so the latter observation is consistent with the fact that blockers lead to an increase in @xmath20 [ fig .",
    "4(b ) in the main text ] .    , for no blockers , and for a blocker dna coverage density of @xmath99 . [ blocktau ] ]",
    "as noted in the text , one of the key assumptions of many models of facilitated diffusion ( for example in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , is that the section of the dna explored by a protein during each 1d diffusion episode is uncorrelated with that during previous episodes .",
    "this leads to the relationship @xmath4 for the average number of rounds of 1d plus 3d diffusion required to find the target .",
    "we find in our simulations that this relationship is reasonable when only a searcher protein is present , but breaks down when either crowders or blockers are present .",
    "this is demonstrated by a plot of @xmath100 , which according to the equation above should have a constant value of unity .",
    "as detailed in the main text , @xmath3 is measured from the simulations as the mean number of distinct dna beads visited during a search round . a recent theory developed by cherstvy et al .",
    "@xcite accounts for correlations in successive 1d searches , but does not take into account steric interactions with crowding proteins .",
    "figure  [ nsfig](a ) shows that there is an increase in @xmath100 with crowder density .",
    "this shows that , increasingly with @xmath18 , more than @xmath101 search rounds are required to find the target .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that crowders increase the likelihood that the same region of the dna is searched during consecutive 1d episodes ( since depletion - like effects favor rebinding of a protein soon after it escapes from the dna ) .    in fig",
    "[ nsfig](b ) , it is shown that for the case of blockers there is a more modest increase in @xmath100 ( except for small values of @xmath2 , where @xmath6 is anyway much larger than in the other cases ) .",
    "the cause here is likely as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , that as the proportion of the dna which is covered by blockers increases , so too does the probability that the target is also covered .     for different numbers of ( a ) crowders and ( b ) dna bound blockers . deviation from @xmath102 indicates a breakdown of key assumptions in classic theories of facilitated diffusion [ eq .",

    "<S> much theoretical and computational effort  @xcite has been spent addressing different facets of this important problem .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the process is still not fully understood , despite recent advances in single molecule imaging techniques that have given new insight into facilitated diffusion mechanisms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the bacterial cytoplasm within which the search is performed is very different from the test tube of _ in vitro _ experiments : it is a very crowded environment , with about a million proteins per cell  @xcite , many of which bind to the dna and perform functions such as transcription , gene regulation , replication and repair , and chromosome structuring  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , only limited theoretical  @xcite or simulation work explicitly addresses this issue . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , colloidal physics arguments suggest that crowding should give rise to depletion  @xcite and other entropic interactions between the constituents of the system : these are important for the thermodynamics of many intracellular processes  @xcite , but their impact on facilitated diffusion has not yet been explored .    our goal in this letter is to investigate the effects of macromolecular crowding , both in the cytosol and along the dna , on the target search process . </S>",

    "<S> these allow us to explicitly include the ( often disregarded ) conformational dynamics of dna ; provide us with a detailed treatment of the 3d component of the search ; and avoid the need to make the _ a priori _ assumptions on the relative timescales of the kinetics in the search process which are necessary in most analytical approaches  @xcite .     ]    for the simulations we coarse grain dna as a bead - and - spring polymer . </S>",
    "<S> the level of coarse graining we use ( the size of a polymeric bead equals the hydration thickness of dna , @xmath1 ) allows many repeat simulations of large systems to be performed , at the cost of losing atomistic details in the resolution of the genome and protein structures . </S>",

    "<S> the depletion attraction thus enhances the robustness of the search time . according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : theory ] ) the cell must precisely tune the protein - dna interaction to optimise the search  difficult , since @xmath2 will vary from protein to protein , depend on dna sequence , and be dependent on conditions such as salt concentration . </S>",
    "<S> thus our finding that @xmath29 is relatively insensitive to @xmath2 near its minimum suggests that the facilitated diffusion search mechanism is better adapted to the subcellular conditions in which it operates than to a hypothetical , uncrowded environment . </S>",

    "<S> our results are qualitatively in agreement with this , showing an increase in @xmath29 with average blocker coverage density @xmath36 which is almost independent of @xmath2 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : blockers](a ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , however , this increase is not dramatic ; this is perhaps another well - adapted feature of facilitated diffusion within a cell where a large number of dna - binding proteins must be present at any time  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the duration of each 3d excursion ( @xmath20 ) increases with @xmath36 since it takes longer for the searcher to encounter dna which is free from blockers ; fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : blockers](b ) top shows a good fit to an exponential function , which is expected since the probability of finding an uncovered region of a given length decreases exponentially with coverage density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we also observe a small decrease in @xmath21 as @xmath36 increases [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : blockers](b ) , bottom ] . </S>",
    "<S> presumably , collisions between the searcher and the blockers can lead to the less strongly bound searcher being `` knocked off '' of the dna . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in our model , searchers can only bypass blockers by transiently detaching from the dna . while this is a good assumption for large blocking proteins or protein clusters ( such as polymerases , replication or transcription factories ) , a searcher may in practice hop over smaller proteins without leaving the genome , as discussed in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> lead to depletion interactions which effectively increase the searcher - dna affinity , and reduce the 3d search time , at the same time increasing the chance of repeat - pass searches through the same dna region . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a decrease in search time for small @xmath2 but an increase for large @xmath2 meaning that at physiological volume fractions of crowders the curve shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) becomes flatter , with @xmath29 increasing only at large @xmath2 . that @xmath29 is independent of @xmath2 near its minimum may be advantageous for efficient searching , since in reality the non - specific searcher - dna interaction must vary both among searchers and along the dna sequence . </S>",
    "<S> robustness to changes in @xmath2 has previously been shown to result from intersegmental transfers  @xcite , in that case at high dna - protein affinity ; this process relies on dna strands passing close to each other in space and so depends on the compaction of the dna . due to their geometry , </S>",
    "<S> intersegmental transfers occur relatively infrequently with our searchers ; concurrent investigation of both of these effects would be an interesting future study .    for dna - binding _ blocker _ proteins we have confirmed previous analytical work which predicted an exponential increase in the 3d search time due to impaired access to the dna  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations also suggest that the blocker - induced increase in the total search time is modest , which is again advantageous in the biological context where a large number of dna - binding proteins must be present simultaneously for the proper functioning of both bacterial and eukaryotic chromosomes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have shown that if multiple searcher proteins are present then the search time scales inversely with copy number , except at very high copy numbers ( see  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our work suggests that a proper account of the crowded cellular environment is crucial for a full understanding of protein - dna target search . </S>",
    "<S> this is becoming an increasingly important issue as direct experimental probes of the process _ in vivo _ become a reality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that , at least in terms of the robustness of the total search time @xmath29 , the facilitated diffusion mechanism is well - adapted to the crowded subcellular conditions in which it takes place . </S>",
