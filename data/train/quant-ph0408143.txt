    "the imaginary time path integral formalism @xcite has been an important tool for studying static or dynamical properties of quantum statistical mechanical systems .",
    "the static properties have successfully been calculated by means of the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) or path integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) technique @xcite . however , these numerical methods have difficulties in computing the dynamical properties such as the real time quantum correlation functions , because the analytic continuation from the imaginary time to the real time is a non - trivial procedure in the numerical calculations @xcite .    as new quantum dynamics methods to calculate the real time quantum correlation functions at finite temperature , the centroid molecular dynamics ( cmd ) method @xcite and the effective potential analytic continuation ( epac ) method @xcite have recently been proposed .",
    "both the methods use effective potentials , which can be numerically calculated by means of the pimc or pimd technique . in computing the real time quantum correlation functions",
    ", the cmd method uses the _ effective classical potential _",
    "@xcite , while the epac method uses the _",
    "standard effective potential _ which appears in the effective action formalism @xcite .",
    "the effective potentials have been extensively used as powerful tools in the calculations of the static properties @xcite , so that they are expected to be effective also for the calculations of the dynamical properties . in practice",
    ", the cmd method has been tested in low - dimensional systems @xcite and applied to various many - body molecular systems to yield many promising results @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has already been shown that the epac method works well in a one - dimensional symmetric double well system @xcite .",
    "this success suggests that the epac should be very useful for the calculation of quantum dynamics of the systems in which quantum coherence is significant .",
    "most of actual potentials appearing in chemical systems and condensed matter systems have asymmetric shapes .",
    "for example , asymmetric double well potentials have been widely used to describe the proton transfer reactions @xcite or the first - order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the other asymmetric potentials such as the morse potential have also been very important and have been repeatedly used in chemical physics as a realistic model of the intramolecular vibration .    in the present paper , the epac method",
    "is therefore applied to the evaluation of real time quantum correlation functions for one - dimensional asymmetric systems .",
    "we investigate whether the epac method can successfully reproduce the exact correlation functions for the morse potential .",
    "we also show that the epac calculation for a certain type of asymmetric potentials can be reduced to that for the corresponding symmetric potentials .",
    "this property is called the _ decoupling property _ , which is quite useful for the discussion of the asymmetrization effect in the quantum statistical systems , for instance , the enhancement or suppression of the transition rate in chemical reaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the decoupling property can aid us in reducing the computational cost required on the pimd / pimc calculation . in this paper",
    ", we analytically prove that this property holds , followed by the numerical examination of it .    in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize the definition of a couple of types of effective potentials and review our epac method . moreover , we explicitly present the standard effective potential and the epac position autocorrelation function for a harmonic oscillator as the simplest example . the epac analyses of one - dimensional systems with asymmetric potentials are shown in sec . iii . after showing the decoupling property of linear terms appearing in the classical potentials , we present the epac results for the asymmetric harmonic / anharmonic oscillators .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we first introduce the effective classical potential defined by feynman @xcite . consider a quantum system where a quantum particle of mass @xmath0 moves in a one - dimensional potential @xmath1 at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum canonical partition function of this system is expressed in terms of the imaginary time path integral @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the euclidean action functional @xmath6=\\int^{\\beta\\hbar}_{0}d\\tau \\left[~\\!\\frac{1}{2}~\\!m ~\\!\\dot{q}^2 + v(q)~\\!\\right ] .",

    "( [ 3 ] ) and integrating out all the fourier modes , we obtain @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the effective classical potential @xcite , which is a function of the position centroid variable @xmath15 . among the integration of all the fourier modes ,",
    "the zero mode integral @xmath16 yields only the replacement @xmath17 , so that the effective classical potential @xmath14 does not contain the fluctuation effect of the zero mode @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the effective classical potential contains only the quantum fluctuation effects of @xmath19 modes .",
    "another type of effective potential @xcite is briefly summarized next . at first , consider the quantum canonical partition function represented in terms of an imaginary time path integral in the presence of a constant external source @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the generating function for the connected green functions with zero energy . from eqs .",

    "the `` conventional '' effective potential @xmath26 is defined as the legendre transform of the generating function @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath27 we refer to this effective potential as the standard effective potential .",
    "this is the leading order of the derivative expansion of the effective action , and contains the effects of both quantum fluctuation and thermal fluctuation in the quantum statistical system .",
    "static _ properties of the system can be reproduced from @xmath26 straightforwardly @xcite .",
    "for example , one can evaluate the expectation value of the position operator @xmath28 using the relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the position of the standard effective potential minimum .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is determined by the stationary condition @xmath31 . in the low temperature limit ,",
    "the two effective potentials are identical @xcite , while the ground state energy of the quantum system is given by the minimum value of @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath32    on the other hand , one can also calculate the _ dynamical _ properties such as real time quantum correlation functions from the standard effective potential @xmath26 . using the effective action formalism @xcite , at first imaginary time",
    "quantum correlation functions are directly obtained from the standard effective potential @xmath26 with the leading order derivative expansion .",
    "then by means of the analytic continuation @xcite real time quantum correlation functions can be readily obtained from the imaginary time quantities .",
    "this is the epac @xcite , an approximation method based on the effective action formalism . following the epac method , for example",
    ", the real time position autocorrelation function @xmath33 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the effective frequency , @xmath36      to illustrate the characteristics of the standard effective potential @xmath26 and the epac correlation function , here we explicitly present the results for a simple system : a quantum harmonic oscillator whose classical potential is given by @xmath37 in this system the effective classical potential can be written as @xcite @xmath38 then we can evaluate the generating function @xmath22 from eqs .",

    "note that @xmath35 of the harmonic oscillator is independent of the temperature . , width=302,height=302 ]    in fact , in the low temperature limit , the potential minimum @xmath43 is equal to that of the effective classical potential @xmath44 , and they give the ground state energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator , @xmath46 on the other hand , in the high temperature limit ( @xmath47 ) , these effective potentials exhibit quite different features .",
    "the standard effective potential minimum @xmath43 diverges to negative infinity , while the effective classical potential minimum @xmath44 converges to zero .",
    "this is because the standard effective potential @xmath26 includes the effects of both quantum fluctuation and thermal fluctuation , while the effective classical potential @xmath14 includes the effect of quantum fluctuation only . in fig .",
    "[ fig : harm ] we show the inverse temperature @xmath48 dependence of @xmath44 , @xmath43 , and @xmath35 with the parameters @xmath45 .",
    "finally we obtain the epac position autocorrelation function for the quantum harmonic oscillator @xmath49 this is equal to the exact correlation function .",
    "the epac method is thus exact for harmonic systems as well as the cmd @xcite .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite , the usefulness of the epac method has been shown for a @xmath50 symmetric double well potential system in comparison with the cmd result .",
    "we expect that the epac method may also be useful for general anharmonic quantum systems . in the present section ,",
    "we embark on a project to investigate how the epac method works in a @xmath51 asymmetric system with the classical potential @xcite , @xmath52 where natural units @xmath53 are employed .",
    "this potential is given by a polynomial approximation to a morse potential , @xmath54 regarding @xmath55 as the small deviation from the minimum @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this polynomial approximation is very good for @xmath57 .",
    "the morse potential ( [ 31 ] ) corresponds to , for example , the parameters denoting the intramolecular vibration of the hcl molecule @xcite . for this system",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath58 corresponds to the temperature @xmath59 .    on the other hand , by a variable shift @xmath60",
    ", we can transform the potential ( [ 30 ] ) to the form @xmath61 which is a potential asymmetrized by the linear term @xmath62 only .",
    "such additional linear terms exhibit interesting feature in the effective potential analyses ; they are irrelevant both to the path integral calculation ( [ 3 ] ) and to the legendre transformation ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "this property ensures that the standard effective potential for the asymmetric potential ( [ 33 ] ) can readily be given by that for the corresponding symmetric potential without the linear term .",
    "this is the decoupling property , which has been discussed for other types of effective potentials in the context of the nonperturbative renormalization group @xcite . in the following",
    "we give a proof of this property for the standard effective potential , and then apply it to the evaluation of the standard effective potentials for an asymmetric harmonic oscillator and the asymmetric anharmonic oscillator ( [ 33 ] ) .",
    "consider a quantum system described by a classical potential of the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is any classical potential and @xmath65 is a constant .",
    "the effective classical potential can be written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the effective classical potential for @xmath64 .",
    "this is because in the euclidean action @xmath68 the linear term consists of only the zero mode @xmath18 , @xmath69 and never generate or receive any quantum correction when we integrate out all the fourier modes to evaluate the effective classical potential .",

    "furthermore , supposing @xmath73 is the solution of the equation @xmath74 and @xmath75 is that of @xmath76 , we get a relation @xmath77 .",

    "equations ( [ 35 ] ) and ( [ 40 ] ) ensure that the functional form of the linear term remains unchanged through the path integration and the legendre transformation , and that it never generates any quantum or thermal correction to @xmath64 .",
    "that is , the linear term in the classical potential decouples from the effective potential calculations .    using eq .",
    "( [ 40 ] ) , we can directly obtain the standard effective potential @xmath26 from @xmath79 .",
    "this means that we have only to carry out the path integration and the legendre transformation for @xmath64 .",
    "this decoupling property is especially useful when @xmath64 is a @xmath80 symmetric potential , because we can simply discuss the asymmetrization effect as the additional linear term effect on @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath51 symmetry reduces the computational cost required on the pimd / pimc calculation for the @xmath51 symmetric @xmath64 .",
    "this is because the required cite number in @xmath15 space is reduced by half by the @xmath51 symmetry @xcite .      as a simple example of the system with the additional linear term ( [ 34 ] )",
    ", we consider an asymmetric harmonic oscillator @xmath81 from eqs .",

    "the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath35 are obtained from the relations @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    in the following",
    "we perform the numerical calculation with scheme ( a ) to test the epac method itself .",
    "the numerical calculation with scheme ( b ) is also performed to check the decoupling property ( [ 40 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : acas ] imply that the leading order derivative expansion employed in the epac method becomes worse at longer time and at higher temperature . to reproduce the damping behavior of the exact @xmath97 at high temperature , we need the higher order derivative expansion of the effective action . however , our calculation at lower temperature @xmath58 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : acas](c ) ] corresponds to , for example , the dynamics of the intramolecular vibration of the hcl molecule at temperature @xmath59 .",
    "therefore our epac method even in the present form ( [ 22 ] ) should work very well for such chemical systems in the realistic temperature region .",
    "finally we mention the applicability of the epac method to a nonpolynomial potential , in particular , an asymptotically sublinear potential such as @xmath98 .",
    "most of the actual potentials appearing in chemical systems and condensed matter systems have this type of potential shape , for example , the morse potential , the lenard - jones potential , and other intramolecular and intermolecular potentials .",
    "an important property of these potentials is that they represent the dissociation in the long distance limit .",
    "it is quite nontrivial to make the dissociation effect involved in the effective potential approach .",
    "in fact , some difficulties have already been pointed out @xcite . from the chemical interest , this is a challenging subject to be examined .",
    "in the present work we have focused on the epac analyses of one - dimensional asymmetric systems . at first , for the asymmetric harmonic oscillator ( [ 41 ] ) , we have analytically shown that the exact real time position autocorrelation function is derived by means of the epac method . as for the asymmetric anharmonic oscillator ( [ 30 ] ) , we could obtain the epac correlation function numerically . in this case ,",
    "at first we have computed the standard effective potential @xmath26 by means of the pimd technique and the numerical legendre transformation .",
    "then we have obtained the position of the effective potential minimum @xmath30 and the effective frequency @xmath35 which are needed to construct the epac position autocorrelation function @xmath99 .",
    "it has been shown that the static properties of this asymmetric system , @xmath100 and @xmath101@xmath102 , are well reproduced by @xmath30 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "as for a long time behavior , we have found that at lower temperature the epac correlation function @xmath99 agrees with the exact @xmath97 very well , whereas the epac result becomes worse as the temperature increases .",
    "this is because the epac method approximates the multimode contribution to the exact real time correlation function by the single - mode contribution with the effective frequency @xmath35 . in a chemical aspect ,",
    "however , it is quite remarkable that a good agreement of the epac correlation function with the exact one is achieved for the realistic potential in the realistic temperature region .    we have also shown that a linear term in a classical potential is irrelevant to the effective potential calculation . for a classical potential @xmath104 ,",
    "the standard effective potential is given by @xmath105 .",
    "we have proved this decoupling property analytically , and have also checked it numerically by calculating @xmath26 and @xmath79 independently .    in the present work",
    ", it has been shown that the epac method is practically applicable to simple systems with single degree of freedom .",
    "more important applications in chemical physics are , however , to the systems with many degrees of freedom . for such applications",
    ", there are a couple of obstacles to be overcome .",
    "the first one is the computation of the generating function @xmath22 . to obtain @xmath22 using eq .",

    "( [ 7a ] ) rather than eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) will be useful for more efficient evaluation of @xmath22 , because the cmd sampling can be used to calculate the statistical - mechanical average of @xmath106 appearing in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) @xcite .",
    "that is , we can use the numerical techniques developed in the cmd calculations for many - body systems @xcite .",

    "[ 8 ] ) ] .",
    "this transformation will also require heavier computations for larger systems .",
