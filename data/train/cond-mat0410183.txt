    "in this article , we consider the problem of attractive fermions in one dimension ( 1d ) , having in mind current experiments on ultra - cold two - component fermi gases of atoms @xcite . in these systems , the @xmath1-wave interaction between fermions in different internal states can be tuned using a feshbach resonance . by changing the interaction from weakly attractive to weakly repulsive via a resonance where the interaction diverges",
    ", one can explore the crossover from a bcs superfluid , when the attraction is weak and pairing only appears in momentum space , to a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of molecular dimers @xcite .",

    "we will refer to such a situation as quasi-1d . in this case , at zero temperature , a crossover takes place between a bcs - like state and a weakly interacting bose gas of dimers .",
    "this crossover can be described by an exactly solvable model ( the so - called modified gaudin - yang model ) @xcite , which is just a combination of the gaudin - yang model for attractive fermions @xcite and of the lieb - liniger model for repulsive dimers @xcite . despite the fact , that there is no genuine off - diagonal long range order in 1d even at zero temperature",

    "<S> we discuss the bcs - bec crossover for one - dimensional spin @xmath0 fermions at zero temperature using the boson - fermion resonance model in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the limit of a broad resonance , this model is equivalent to an exactly solvable single channel model , the so - called modified gaudin - yang model . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the one - dimensional crossover may be realized either via the combination of a feshbach resonance and a confinement induced resonance or using direct photo - association in a two - component fermi gas with effectively one - dimensional dynamics . in both cases , the system may be driven from a bcs - like state through a molecular tonks - girardeau gas close to resonance to a weakly interacting bose gas of dimers . </S>"
