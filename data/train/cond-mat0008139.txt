    "existence and characteristics of the spin glass phase are actively investigated for finite - dimensional random spin systems .",
    "closely related is the problem of the mixed ( glassy ) ferromagnetic phase .",
    "if the mean - field picture applies to finite - dimensional systems , the ferromagnetic phase would split up into two regions , one with a simple structure ( the replica - symmetric ( rs ) phase in the mean - field framework ) and the other with a complex phase space ( replica - symmetry broken ( rsb ) state ) . the boundary between these two phases would be the finite - dimensional counterpart of the at ( de almeida - thouless ) line found for the infinite - range sk ( sherrington - kirkpatrick ) model .",
    "investigations of these and related problems are almost exclusively carried out currently by numerical methods because of lack of reliable analytical methods .",
    "we show in the present contribution that simple symmetry arguments lead to a strong constraint on the possible location and shape of the at line in the phase diagram of the ising spin glass on an arbitrary lattice with arbitrary range of interactions . more precisely , it is possible to prove that there is nothing like rsb on the nishimori line in the phase diagram and that the at line , if it ever exists , should start as a vertical line from the multicritical point where paramagnetic , ferromagnetic and spin glass phases merge .",
    "our method is an application of the gauge theory which has been used to derive exact energy and many other exact / rigorous results .",
    "let us consider the @xmath0 ising model ( @xmath1 ) with the hamiltonian @xmath2 where the sum is over pairs of sites on an arbitrary lattice with arbitrary range of interactions .",
    "the exchange interactions are quenched random variables with the distribution function @xmath3 the hamiltonian ( [ nishimori : hamiltonian ] ) is invariant under gauge transformation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an arbitrarily fixed ising spin .",
    "the gauge invariance of the hamiltonian leads to a number of exact and/or rigorous results @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the internal energy @xmath6_{k_p } ,      \\label{nishimori : e - def}\\ ] ] where the inner triangular brackets denote a thermodynamic average and the outer square brackets represent the configurational average at a fixed value of @xmath7 .",
    "the suffixes denote the temperature and @xmath7 through @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the exact value of the internal energy can be calculated explicitly under the constraint @xmath10 to give @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of bonds on the lattice under consideration .",
    "the constraint @xmath13 defines a curve in the phase diagram shown dashed in figure [ nishimori : fig1 ] , which is often called the nishimori line .",
    "there are many other results including an upper bound on the specific heat @xmath14 a correlation identity @xmath15_k        = \\left [ \\langle s_i s_j \\rangle_k^2 \\right]_k ,        \\label{nishimori : corr - identity}\\ ] ] and a correlation inequality @xmath15_{k_p }        \\le       \\left [ \\left| \\langle s_i s_j \\rangle_{k_p } \\right|",
    "\\right]_{k_p}.             \\label{nishimori : corr - ineq}\\ ] ] the correlation identity ( [ nishimori : corr - identity ] ) means that the nishimori line @xmath16 avoids the spin glass phase because the left - hand side reduces to the square of the ferromagnetic long range order @xmath17 as the distance between @xmath18 and @xmath19 tends to infinity whereas the right - hand side approaches the square of the spin glass order parameter @xmath20 in the same limit .",
    "the spin glass phase is characterized by @xmath21 which is inconsistent with the relation @xmath22 .",
    "the correlation inequality ( [ nishimori : corr - ineq ] ) places a constraint on the possible shape of the boundary between the ferromagnetic and spin glass phases : this boundary can either be vertical or re - entrant in the phase diagram . the ferromagnetic phase is not allowed to lie below the spin glass phase @xcite .",
    "the gauge theory summarized above applies to derive an identity between the distribution functions of the ferromagnetic and spin glass order parameters on the nishimori line @xcite .",
    "the distribution function of magnetization is defined as @xmath23_{k_p}.    \\label{nishimori : pm}\\ ] ] to define the distribution function of the spin glass order parameter , it is convenient to introduce two replicas of the same system with spins @xmath24 and @xmath25 and the couplings @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively : @xmath28_{k_p } ,    \\label{nishimori : pq}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the distribution of the spin glass order parameter is defined in terms of two replicas with the same temperature , @xmath31 .",
    "note that the distributions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are all functions of @xmath7 as well .",
    "it is well established that the distribution of magnetization has a simple structure with two delta functions as depicted in the left part of figure [ nishimori : fig2 ] .",
    "the spin glass order parameter , on the other hand , has a more complex structure .",
    "for example , if there exists a full rsb , the distribution has a continuous part as depicted schematically in the right part of figure [ nishimori : fig2 ] . or",
    ", it may have delta peaks at a few additional locations in the case of finite - step rsb . in any case , the complexity of the system is closely related with the structure of the distribution function @xmath34 different from that of @xmath35 .",
    "our main result is the following relation : @xmath36 which holds for any combination of @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in particular ,",
    "if we set @xmath10 , equation ( [ nishimori : pmq - relation1 ] ) reduces to the relation between the usual distribution functions of magnetization and spin glass order parameter : @xmath39 this immediately proves that the distribution function of the spin glass order parameter on the right - hand side has a simple structure represented by the magnetization distribution on the left - hand side if @xmath13 .",
    "the simplicity of the exact energy ( [ nishimori : exact - e ] ) and a few other results @xcite suggest that the phase space of the system would not be complicated .",
    "the above result is regarded as definite evidence to support this anticipation .",
    "it also follows from differentiation of equation ( [ nishimori : pmq - relation1 ] ) that the derivatives of the distribution functions @xmath40 and @xmath33 with respect to @xmath41 and @xmath7 vanish when @xmath13 : @xmath42 for almost all @xmath43 when @xmath13 .",
    "these relations have been derived from the fact that the distribution of magnetization @xmath40 consists just of two delta functions and therefore its derivatives with respect to the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath7 vanish for almost all @xmath43 . equation ( [ nishimori : pq - derivative ] ) then follows from ( [ nishimori : pmq - relation1 ] ) .",
    "the relation ( [ nishimori : pq - derivative ] ) shows that the distribution function of the spin glass order parameter remains vanishing at almost all @xmath43 if the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath7 deviate infinitesimally from their values satisfying @xmath13 .",
    "thus the structure of @xmath33 does not develop a continous part under an infinitesimal deviation from the nishimori line .",
    "an interesting consequence is that the mixed phase with a continuous part in @xmath34 , if it starts to exist at the multicritical point , does not have a finite extension under a very small deviation from the multicritical point .",
    "stated otherwise , the phase boundaries ( the at line and the boundary between the mixed and spin glass phases ) should merge smoothly as they approach the multicritical point as depicted on the left part of fig .",
    "[ nishimori : fig3 ] .",
    "a natural generic situation would be that both of these boundaries are vertical around the multicritical point as in the case of the sk model .",
    "it should be noted that this argument does not apply when the rsb in the mixed phase is characterized by several delta functions , in which case the boundary with the structure like the one on the right part of fig .",
    "[ nishimori : fig3 ] does not violate ( [ nishimori : pq - derivative ] ) .",
    "the proof of the relation ( [ nishimori : pmq - relation1 ] ) is not very difficult @xcite .",
    "we start from writing out the configurational average of the distribution function of magnetization @xmath44 the weight of configurational average ( @xmath7 or @xmath45 for each bond ) is taken care of by the factor @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the gauge transformation ( [ nishimori : g - trsf ] ) changes the above equation into the form @xmath47 it is relatively straightforward to see that the right - hand side is equal to @xmath48 by summing it up over all possible @xmath25 , dividing the result by @xmath49 , and finally inserting an identity @xmath50 after the summation symbol over @xmath51 .",
    "we have proved that the at line , if any , should lie below the nishimori line in the phase diagram of the @xmath0 ising model on an arbitrary lattice .",
    "it has also been argued that the mixed phase with a continous part in the distribution function of the spin glass order parameter , if any again , does not have a finite extension around the multicritical point .",
