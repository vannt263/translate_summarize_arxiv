    "a few years ago wilczek and collaborators proposed a new method to derive the hawking flux from spherical black holes@xcite .",
    "they have proved , using a dimensional reduction procedure , that near the event horizon effective field theories become two - dimensional and exhibit gauge and gravitational anomalies .",
    "they showed , in the unruh vacuum , that the hawking flux emerges in order to cancel these anomalies .",
    "recent applications and a modification of this method can be found in refs .  . a more technically simplified version of the method for asymptotically flat spacetimes , using only the covariant form of the anomalies ,",
    "was suggested in ref .  .",
    "the purpose of this brief article , which is based in ref .  , is to apply this method of covariant anomalies in asymptotically non - flat spacetimes of non - spherical topology .",
    "consider the four - dimensional black hole solutions of einstein s equations with negative cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "these asymptotically locally anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes are known as topological black holes ( tbhs)@xcite and their metric is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the ads radius and @xmath3 is a constant proportional to the black hole mass .",
    "their topology is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a two - dimensional manifold of constant negative curvature .",
    "the angular part of , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , is the line element of the manifold @xmath5 , which is locally isomorphic to the hyperbolic manifold @xmath8 and of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a discrete subgroup of isometries of @xmath11 .",
    "the manifold @xmath5 is a compact two - dimensional surface of constant negative curvature and of genus @xmath12@xcite .",
    "below , i will concentrate only on the genus @xmath13 case and deal with the event horizon @xmath14 , which corresponds to the outer horizon for @xmath15 and to the unique horizon for @xmath16 .",
    "now consider a complex scalar field @xmath17 in the background of the tbh of genus two .",
    "its action is @xmath18 where the first term is the free part of the action and @xmath19 is the part which includes a mass term , potential terms and self - interaction terms .",
    "i perform a partial wave decomposition of @xmath20 in terms of the functions @xmath21 , which are defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the associated legendre functions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 takes discrete real values @xmath26 . these functions",
    "form a complete orthonormalized set of functions on the manifold @xmath5 of genus two@xcite . upon transforming to the `` tortoise ''",
    "coordinate @xmath27 defined by @xmath28 and taking the near - horizon limit @xmath29 , one finds that the effective radial potentials for partial wave modes of the field , the mass term and the interaction terms contain the suppression factor @xmath30 and vanish exponentially fast@xcite . keeping only dominant terms ,",
    "i find that physics near the event horizon can be effectively described by an infinite collection of two - dimensional free massless scalar fields , each propagating in a two - dimensional spacetime , which is given by the @xmath31 part of the tbh metric of @xcite .    in this reduced two - dimensional spacetime , following the ideas of wilczek et al.@xcite , i neglect the ingoing modes in the region near the event horizon , which behave as left - moving modes , since they can not classically affect physics outside the horizon .",
    "then , the effective two - dimensional theory exhibits a gravitational anomaly in this region , in the form of the non - conservation of the energy - momentum tensor@xcite .",
    "the time component of the covariant gravitational anomaly is@xcite @xmath32 @xmath33 is the covariant energy - momentum tensor and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath34 . solving this equation with the proposed in refs .",
    "boundary condition @xmath35 , i find the non - conserved energy - momentum tensor @xmath36 the hawking flux is measured at infinity , where there is no gravitational anomaly and in refs .",
    "it was given by the conserved energy - momentum tensor .",
    "one sees that the gravitational anomaly @xmath37 vanishes at asymptotic infinity .",
    "however , @xmath38 is non - zero there , due to the fact that the spacetime asymptotically is ads .",
    "these remarks and , which can be written as @xmath39 , imply that the conserved energy - momentum tensor , or the energy flux @xmath40 measured at infinity , is @xmath41 the energy flux @xmath40 has a form equivalent to blackbody radiation of temperature @xmath42@xcite , which is exactly the hawking temperature of the tbh of @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath40 can be identified with the hawking flux from this tbh .",
    "however , i should note that the actual hawking radiation observed at infinity is calculated through the grey - body factors , due to the curvature of the spacetime away from the horizon@xcite .",
    "another interesting non - spherical black hole solution is a tbh conformally coupled to a scalar field @xmath43 .",
    "this black hole solution is known as the mtz black hole@xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is newton s constant and @xmath46 is a constant proportional to the black hole mass .",
    "the mtz black hole has the same topology as the tbhs previously analyzed .",
    "therefore , i will concentrate again only on the case of @xmath5 being a genus two compact surface of constant negative curvature and deal with the event horizon @xmath47 , which is the unique horizon for @xmath48 and the outer horizon for @xmath49 .    considering a complex scalar field @xmath20 in the background of the mtz black hole of genus two , which does not interact with the scalar field @xmath43 , the dimensional reduction procedure proceeds as in",
    ". all the arguments of hold also in this case@xcite and the conserved energy - momentum tensor is @xmath50 this energy flux has a form equivalent to blackbody radiation of temperature @xmath51@xcite , which is the hawking temperature of the mtz black hole .",
    "the conformally coupled scalar field @xmath43 , which is time - independent , does not contribute to the hawking flux .",
    "this was proved explicitly in ref .   by showing that its action near the horizon vanishes , due to the presence of the suppression factor @xmath30 .",
    "conclusively , i derived the hawking temperature and flux , without backscattering effects , from non - spherical black holes in asymptotically non - flat spacetimes , via the method of covariant anomalies , and showed that an infinite set of two - dimensional scalar fields near the horizon acts as the thermal source of this flux .",
