    "the most massive galactic globular cluster , @xmath0centauri ( ngc5139 ) is of considerable interest both for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "being the most populous star cluster in our galaxy , one has a chance to catch stars in their most rapid phases of post - main - sequence evolution , such as post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) stars which evolve on timescales of @xmath5 years or less to become white dwarfs after significant mass return into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "its proximity , @xmath6 kpc ( e.g. , del principe et al .",
    "2006 ; van de ven et al .  2006 ; caputo et al .",
    "2002 ) , and relatively low foreground extinction , @xmath7 mag ( lub 2002 ) , further aid in detailed studies of its constituents . besides",
    ", @xmath0cen may hold vital clues to understanding the assembly of massive galaxies and the fate of the many satellites predicted to have formed in the @xmath8-cdm cosmological paradigm ( klypin et al .",
    "understanding its dynamical history and possible origin within a larger galactic body are key to understanding the nature of ultra - massive globular clusters such as g1 in the local group spiral galaxy m31 ( e.g. , gebhardt et al .",
    "2002 ) , the ultra - compact dwarf galaxies found in the fornax cluster ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the tidal dissolution of stellar systems that then populate the galactic halo with field stars .",
    "it has long been known that @xmath0centauri hosts stars spanning a range of metallicities , contrary to the paradigm that globular clusters are co - eval , chemically uniform systems .",
    "norris et al .  (",
    "1996 ) determined calcium abundances of bright red giant branch ( rgb ) stars and found that about 80 per cent belong to a metal - poor component now identified with a metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath9 , with the remaining 20 per cent constituting a metal - richer component , of [ fe / h ] @xmath10 .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and pancino et al.(2000 , 2002 ) , using optical colour - magnitude diagrams , discovered a third sub - population in the form of an anomalous feature in the rgb morphology , the rgb - a ; these red giants are , with [ fe / h ] @xmath11 , an order of magnitude more metallic than the main population of @xmath0cen .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) proposed an extended period of star formation , lasting @xmath12 gyr , to explain the different populations through a chemical enrichment scenario within a larger , now - disrupted system , a scenario proposed previously also by zinnecker et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and freeman ( 1993 ) .",
    "although stanford et al .  ( 2006a ) do indeed find that the metal - rich stars are the youngest by 2 - 4 gyr , sollima et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that the metal - rich and intermediate - metallicity populations must have formed within 2 gyr from the oldest metal - poor stars .",
    "the situation may be more complicated : villanova et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest that the metal - rich stars and a third of the metal - poor stars are the _ oldest _ , with the remaining two - thirds of metal - poor stars and the intermediate - metallicity stars being younger by 3 - 4 gyr .",
    "a double main sequence was discovered by anderson ( 1997 ; see also bedin et al .",
    "2004 ) , and interpreted by norris ( 2004 ) in terms of the three rgb sub - populations ; counter - intuitively , the _ less _ metal - poor population must correspond to the _ bluer _ main sequence ( confirmed spectroscopically by piotto et al .",
    "norris explained this by the intermediate - metallicity population being enhanced in helium .",
    "though reconciling the observations , the helium enhancement poses a challenge for chemical evolution models , as neither all of the cluster sub - giant stars nor all the intermediate - metallicity rrlyrae variables on the horizontal branch ( hb ) are helium - rich ( villanova et al .  2007 ; sollima et al .  2006 ) .",
    "the mixed stellar populations complicate studies of stellar evolution in @xmath0cen , but on the other hand it offers the possibility to compare the evolution of stars between these different populations .",
    "questions that remain to be answered include the mechanism of mass loss on the rgb , how ( and why ) it varies between different stars , and how this is reflected in the properties of the hb ( see catelan 2005 for a review ) , in particular the extreme hb ( dcruz et al .",
    "1996 ) . a type of hb star , rrlyrae - type pulsators are distance indicators .",
    "the rrlyrae - derived distance to @xmath0cen ( @xmath13 kpc : del principe et al .",
    "2006 ) differs from that derived from the internal kinematics ( @xmath14 kpc : van de ven et al .",
    "2006 ) , and it is therefore important to reach a full understanding of the rrlyrae phenomenon .",
    "different types of rrlyrae exist in @xmath0cen , pulsating in different modes , and stars are found with colours and magnitudes that overlap with those of rrlyrae but which are not strong pulsators ( sandage & katem 1968 ) .",
    "it is not clear to what extent this is due to different evolutionary stages , differences in rgb mass loss , or a result of the spread in elemental abundances .    during the subsequent agb and post - agb evolution additional mass",
    "is returned to the ism , possibly enriched in s - process elements and/or dust grains .",
    "it is not clear , though , how many globular cluster stars reach the agb , how many of those experience @xmath3 dredge - up , and whether globular cluster carbon stars must all have formed through external pollution .",
    "it is also not understood how agb mass loss and dust formation proceeds at a considerably sub - solar metallicity ( van loon 2006 ) .",
    "a different question altogether is how much post - agb stars contribute to the uv light from old stellar systems such as elliptical galaxies ; this depends on the zero - age post - agb luminosity function and the timescale of post - agb evolution .",
    "the present study was motivated by the van leeuwen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) survey , who determined the proper motion membership probabilities of nearly 10,000 stars within half a degree from the centre of the cluster down to a photographic magnitude of @xmath15 .",
    "we obtained medium - resolution follow - up spectroscopy in the b - band of more than 1500 probable members . whilst other follow - up studies concentrated on obtaining radial velocities to map the 3-dimensional kinematical structure of the cluster ( reijns et al .",
    "2006 ) our survey covers sufficient line diagnostics to be able to also automatically determine temperatures , gravities and metallicities through fitting of the synthetic spectra of model atmospheres .",
    "this allows us to break the degeneracies encountered in colour - magnitude diagrams , and to study the effect of metallicity on stellar evolution .",
    "abundances of carbon , nitrogen and s - process elements such as barium can be compared to assess the degree of enrichment from internal nucleosynthesis and external pollution .",
    "the survey also provides candidates for more detailed follow - up studies , including the use of blue - hb stars as torches shining through the intervening ism .",
    "preliminary results were presented in van loon ( 2002 ) , and the spectra are currently used to support our _ spitzer space telescope _ irac+mips atlas of the cluster ( boyer et al .  2007",
    "; mcdonald et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : + * 2 * spectroscopy with the aat/2df + observations + data reduction + * 3 * the target sample + * 4 * the database + the measurement of stellar parameters + data quality and reliability of the model fits + description of the electronic database + * 5 * results + cluster membership and internal kinematics + interstellar absorption by ionised gas + metallicity and the morphology of the hertzsprung- russell diagram + the first ascent red giant branch ( rgb ) + the nature of the anomalous rgb branch + nitrogen enrichment + chromospheric activity + the rrlyrae instability strip + extreme horizontal branch stars ( ehb ) + the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) + m - type stars + pulsation + dredge - up + carbon stars + post - agb and uv - bright stars + * 6 * discussion + late stages of evolution of metal - poor stars + horizontal branch stars and rrlyrae variables + asymptotic giant branch stars and dredge - up + mass loss and post - giant branch evolution + cluster formation and evolution + the nature of the multiple stellar populations + gas retention and accretion + * 7 * summary of conclusions",
    "the 2-degree field ( 2df ) multi - fibre spectrograph at the anglo australian telescope ( aat ) was used on the second half of the nights on 26 and 27 february and 1 and 2 march , 2000 , in combination with the 1200b grating to obtain spectra in the approximate range @xmath14940   at a resolving power of @xmath2 .",
    "a log of the observations is presented in table 1 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,>,>,>,>,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to investigate the extent to which the freedom in our method may produce less realistic solutions than methods in which some of the parameters are set _ a priori _ , we have run our model fitting procedure on the 13 rgb - a candidate stars with @xmath16 and @xmath17 but constraining the solution for t@xmath18 to that closest to the value predicted by the alonso et al.(1999 ) colour - t@xmath18 relation .",
    "the results are listed in table 4 ( with subscripts `` a '' ) and compared to the solutions obtained with the unrestrained procedure ( with subscripts `` 0 '' ) .",
    "the differences are generally small , only one step in temperature and/or metallicity .",
    "this is because the original procedure yields temperatures that are already in fair agreement with the colour - t@xmath18 relations .",
    "although in six cases the value for [ fe / h ] has increased by constraining the value for t@xmath18 , in three cases it has actually decreased .",
    "the formerly most metal - rich star in this selection , # 77010 has become one of the most metal - poor stars .",
    "this is the only star for which the value for the gravity changed : from @xmath19 to become 0 .",
    "we conclude that setting constraints on the available parameterspace informed by photometry has a systematic but not very dramatic effect on the metallicity determinations , and does not necessarily result in higher metallicities for stars in the rgb - a portion of the ( b , b ",
    "v ) colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "irrespectively , our selection of rgb - a stars is not uniformly strong in cn .",
    "in fact , some m - type stars are found on the rgb - a .",
    "these are cool , which would have made cn bands strong , but clearly oxygen - rich , which agrees with the observed weak cn bands .",
    "pancino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and origlia et al .",
    "( 2003 ) indeed find that rgb - a stars have solar [ @xmath20/fe ] , and suggest the delayed enrichment with iron by supernovae of type ia .",
    "these stars must then also be pre - enriched in s - process elements by a previous generation of agb stars .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by the increasing strength of the barium line with increasing metallicity ( fig .",
    "23 ) , which would be more consistent if the rgb - a stars were metal - rich .",
    "the cn - rich stars are generally metal - rich as well as nitrogen - enriched  compared to m - type stars and cn - weak stars in general .",
    "the elevated levels of nitrogen must be due to pre - enrichment in these stars .",
    "the helium - rich stars are probably related to this episode of formation from gas enriched by massive stars .",
    "different evidences suggesting a large helium enhancement of rgb - a stars have been put forward ( norris et al .",
    "1996 ; sollima et al .  2005 ;",
    "lee et al .  2005 ; villanova et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we conclude that care has to be exercised in studying the rgb - a , as extreme agb stars may mimic rgb - a optical colours and magnitudes . in combination with the difficulty in modelling accurately the stellar atmospheres and spectra of cool stars and measuring the stellar properties from low - resolution spectra",
    ", this explains our general finding that rgb - a stars may be metal - poor whilst all other evidence suggests that ( true ) rgb - a stars are metal - rich .",
    "our data independently confirm some of the internal kinematic properties of @xmath0cen as reported in the literature , in particular the rotation of its core ( merritt et al .",
    "1997 ; van leeuwen & le poole 2002 ; reijns et al.2006 ) .",
    "we do not find evidence for different kinematics of the various sub - populations , nor for a different spatial distribution .",
    "sollima et al.(2007 ) find that the blue ( intermediate metal - rich ) main sequence stars are more concentrated towards the cluster centre , confirming an earlier result obtained by norris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and for the metal - rich stars by pancino et al .",
    "norris et al .  (",
    "1997 ) and ferraro et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also suggested a difference in kinematics between the metal - poor and metal - rich populations , but van de ven et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and pancino et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , as well as our own data , show that there is no evidence for such difference thus removing the strongest evidence for a merger scenario to explain the multiple populations in @xmath0cen .",
    "the more likely scenario for producing the multiple populations in @xmath0cen thus remains the prolonged or episodic star formation as a result of gas retention or accretion in the immediate proto - cluster environment , possibly as part of a once larger system ( cf.bekki 2006 ) .",
    "we obtained a crude map of the diffuse ionized medium in the foreground of @xmath0cen , demonstrating the potential of using the many blue hb stars in metal - poor globular clusters for probing the ism .",
    "we also tentatively detect , in both the h and k components of the caii doublet , what appears to be a high - velocity cloud moving towards @xmath0cen at a ( projected ) velocity close to 200 km s@xmath21 with respect to the systemic motion of the cluster .",
    "this is faster than the expected free - fall velocity , which would be @xmath22 km s@xmath21 to reach the inner half - mass radius of @xmath23 pc if the total mass is @xmath24 m@xmath25 ( van de ven et al .",
    "the cluster is therefore likely to pass through it and leave it behind .",
    "slower encounters could lead to capture of interstellar clouds , and we speculate that accretion events could in the distant past have led to the formation of the chemically distinct sub - populations that we see today .",
    "we obtained medium - resolution optical spectra for @xmath26 proper motion members of the galactic globular cluster @xmath0centauri , making a particular effort to sample the entire upper part of the optical colour - magnitude diagram ( not just where most stars are ) .",
    "we measured the radial velocity , effective temperature , metallicity and gravity in an automated fashion by fitting synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres .",
    "we present a catalogue which contains these data as well as the measured line strengths of caii h+k , ba 4554  , and cn , ch and tio .    the radial velocities confirm membership for nearly all stars , and display the known rotation of the cluster core .",
    "the metallicity distribution peaks around [ fe / h]@xmath27 , with a secondary peak around [ fe / h]@xmath28 .    the rrlyrae stars pulsating in the @xmath29 overtone are found to be warmer on average than those pulsating in the fundamental mode . four stars pulsating with periods @xmath30 d have relatively low gravities , either because they have evolved towards the agb and/or their masses are reduced as a result of mass loss .",
    "we tentatively identify a sample of low - amplitude variables in the blue part of the rrlyrae instability strip on the basis of their relatively large variations in gravity between multiple measurements .",
    "for one rrlyrae star we find blue - shifted hydrogen balmer line emission .",
    "measurements of metallicities and temperatures purely on the basis of our spectroscopy do not always agree with the more commonly used methods in which the temperature is constrained with photometry ; e.g. , the anomalous rgb appears metal - poor in our data , contrary to what is generally accepted .",
    "this is likely the result of the inherent difficulty in modelling the atmospheres and spectra of cool stars , and the intrusion into the rgb - a optical colours and magnitudes regime by extreme agb stars .",
    "we identify several new cluster carbon stars , and find evidence for thermal pulses enriching m - type agb stars with barium",
    ". this super - enhancement is distinct from the pre - enrichment in s - process elements by a previous generation of more massive agb stars , which our measurements also confirm to have taken place .",
    "we also identify several post - agb stars and other uv - bright stars ; their and the agb star properties can be interpreted as mass loss on the rgb being slightly less efficient around [ fe / h]@xmath31 than around [ fe / h]@xmath32 .",
    "evidence for mass return into the ism is present in the form of hydrogen line emission from post - agb stars , and we postulate that some of the brightest carbon stars might eventually inject carbon - rich dust into the ism .    blue hb stars are used to probe the intervening ionized ism in the caii h+k lines , revealing possible interaction between the cluster and surrounding diffuse matter .",
    "higher - resolution spectra of more blue hb stars are required to confirm these results .",
    "we wish to thank terry bridges for performing the 2df observations in his capacity as erstwhile 2df fellow , and for his advice during the fibre configuration and data reduction stages .",

    "the observed spectrum , @xmath33 is presumed to be described approximately as a taylor series expanded to second order around each spectral point @xmath34 , @xmath35 and the model spectrum , @xmath36 , is written in identical fashion . rather than striving to obtain @xmath37 ,",
    "we search for the model which yields @xmath38 , in every point of the spectrum . thus , with @xmath39",
    "spectral points we minimise the statistic @xmath40 in practice , we choose to evaluate the series expansion at a positive deviation by one spectral point , i.e.  @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42-order term is simply the difference between the model and observed spectrum at @xmath43 , @xmath44 the @xmath29-order term corresponds to the slope around @xmath43 , @xmath45 whilst the @xmath46-order term is estimated from the difference in slope at either side of @xmath43 , i.e.  in points @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 combination of eqs .",
    "( a3 - 5 ) yields @xmath50 if the line core has a different slope from the model then it will increase the value of @xmath51 ; if it is simply shallower then it will not contribute to @xmath51 , but such discrepancies will , of course , contribute to @xmath51 in adjacent points .",
    "a conspiracy could arise if @xmath52 and @xmath53 cancel each other and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are identical but not zero .",
    "clearly the spectral shape around that point would be quite different in the model and observed spectra , but although this might occur in individual spectral points the overall spectrum would be sufficiently different that it is highly unlikely to minimise @xmath51 over the full spectrum .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed in which noise was added to a variety of spectra produced from the atlas9 models .",
    "the method recovered the input , never deviating by more than one step as long as the s / n ratio exceeded @xmath56 .",
    "the model spectra are highly idealised versions , though , and in reality stellar spectra deviate for many reasons .",
    "the traditional @xmath51 method on a pixel - by - pixel basis is susceptible to single , strong spectral features such as the cn bands or cah+k lines .",
    "these were sometimes noticed to drive the solution into an extreme corner of parameterspace whereas our modified @xmath51 method would find a more `` expected '' solution ( e.g. , [ fe / h]@xmath57 , or low gravity in case of a bright cluster red giant or high gravity in case of an extreme hb star , et cetera ) .",
    "our method thus seems more robust than the traditional @xmath51 minimisation , as it takes account of correlated behaviour due to spectral structure .    to illustrate the contrast of @xmath51 in parameterspace ,",
    "@xmath51 maps are shown in fig .",
    "a1 for three cases , always for the best - matched velocity . in each map , for each pair of values of the two parameters on the axes the minimum value of @xmath51 is plotted , i.e.  it is not a simple cross - section through the @xmath58 , \\log(g))$ ] parameterspace but a projection of where @xmath51 is minimal . this more accurately maps the space where solutions tend to migrate , but it means that the corresponding value of the third parameter varies across each map .",
    "cooler solutions tend to be accompanied by lower metallicity to offset the diminished line opacity .",
    "the method easily distinguishes between a metal - poor cluster red giant ( fig .",
    "a1 , left panels ) and a metal - rich foreground star ( fig .",
    "a1 , middle panels ) . the gravity for hb stars ( fig .",
    "a1 , right panels ) is less well constrained though this hardly affects the solution for @xmath59 and to a lesser extent [ fe / h ] ."
