    "over the last ten years , the analysis of change point problems in a _ functional data _ framework became a quite popular area of research .",
    "the incorporation of projections on functional principal components , i.e. eigenfunctions of the ( long run ) covariance operator , is meanwhile a well - established technique for change point procedures and there is a considerable amount of literature on this topic such as , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the book of @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite most literature uses the assumption of well - separated leading @xmath0 eigenvalues @xmath1 to ensure suitable estimation of principal components _ up to signs_. in the latter article it is shown in a rather broad generality that for the estimation of subspaces spanned by the @xmath0 leading principal components only the gap @xmath2 is relevant , if these subspaces are estimated _ as a whole _ and not in each direction separately .",
    "we use the work of @xcite to show _ how _ the assumption on distinct eigenvalues can be omitted in a common change point framework .",
    "the idea is to consider one projection of _ functional partial sums _ on a @xmath0-dimensional subspace rather than @xmath0 partial sums of one - dimensional projections .",
    "another contribution is the study of change corrected principal components . loosely speaking",
    ", the idea is to correct the leading empirical principal component with an estimate of the _ change direction _ such that , on one hand , the component is asymptotically oriented in the change direction under the alternative but , on the other hand , still estimates the true principal component under the null hypothesis .",
    "note that the change direction represents the most informative subspace in our change point setting .",
    "a remarkable feature of this alignment is that it allows us to test for more complex _",
    "multidirectional _ changes in exactly the same fashion and under the same set of assumptions .",
    "this approach can be related to the study of _ one - dimensional _ projections of @xcite under high - dimensionality and also to corrections of covariance estimates which are common practice in multivariate change point analysis ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , remark 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is a real and separable infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the inner product is denoted by @xmath4 and the corresponding norm by @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "there should be no confusion , if we simply write @xmath7 and @xmath8 without the subscript @xmath3 .",
    "the mean @xmath9 of a hilbert space random variable @xmath10 is defined generally as the element that fulfills @xmath11 for all @xmath12 given that @xmath13 .",
    "note that we show our results in an abstract setting having the space @xmath14 $ ] of square - integrable functions in mind .",

    "we begin with a description of the model and of the hypothesis tests in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec : pca ] we continue to explain the principal components approach and then state our theoretical results on the cusum test based on repeated eigenvalues in section [ sec : asymp ] .",
    "the change adjusted principal components are introduced and studied in section [ sec : aligned ] and afterwards extended to more complex multiple - direction alternatives in section [ sec : multipledirections ] .",

    "some weak dependence condition will be imposed further below .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is the normalized direction of the means and @xmath24 is a function that describes their magnitude .",

    "they focused more on other alternatives but also state or indicate some results in our situation .",
    "to test @xmath28 versus @xmath29 we will use a cusum procedure relying on dimension reduction where the basis of the reduced subspaces will be generated by _ generalized _ hilbert space principal components .",
    "those have been suggested in a functional two - sample context by @xcite and are motivated by the optimality properties of principal components and of their empirical counterparts .",
    "to state our results and our interpretation of the projection based cusum we need to introduce the generalized principal components first .",
    "the _ generalized _ principal components are eigenelements of the long run covariance operator @xmath30,\\ ] ] where the _ tensor operator _ @xmath31 is defined via @xmath32 for any @xmath33 and thus is linear in all components .",

    "let @xmath37 be for the moment a generic estimate of @xmath36 and assume that @xmath37 is a self - adjoint hilbert - schmidt operator , too . in this case we may represent both operators using the spectral decomposition @xmath38 with real eigenvalues @xmath39 and @xmath40 . without loss of generality we may assume @xmath41 and also that the @xmath42 s form an orthonormal basis of @xmath3 .",
    "we make exactly the same assumption on the eigenelements of @xmath37 but do not assume that all @xmath40 are non - negative .",
    "note that we use the term _ generalized _ to distinguish between eigenelements of @xmath36 and eigenelements of the covariance operator @xmath43 .",
    "the latter will be called _ standard _ principal components .",
    "we want to consider the following projection based cusum statistics @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the empirical counterpart of @xmath46 .",
    "the detectors are based on projected time series @xmath47^{\\prime},\\qquad \\hat{{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}}_i=[\\langle \\eta_i , \\hat{v}_1 \\rangle , \\ldots , \\langle \\eta_i , \\hat{v}_d \\rangle]^{\\prime}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we write @xmath48 to denote their centered partial sums .",
    "note that @xmath46 is not fully observable in practice , since the eigenelements of @xmath36 will rarely be known .",
    "the matrix @xmath49 is the long run covariance matrix of @xmath50 and @xmath51 is its generic estimate .",

    "will ensure that @xmath57 holds true under the null hypothesis , too .",
    "we do not require the latter under the alternative , but set @xmath58 if @xmath59 for some @xmath60 .",
    "it is well - known that a _ functional central limit theorem _ for the projected time series @xmath50 allows to establish weak convergence of @xmath46 under the null hypothesis by means of the continuous mapping theorem . under short range dependence ( such as , e.g. , strong mixing or @xmath61-@xmath62-approximability )",
    "the statistics @xmath46 , @xmath45 and other related detectors are studied in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite . under @xmath28",

    "is usually done by considering the estimation of the eigenstructure in each direction separately and not at once .",
    "this separated treatment is the origin of some technical issues and in particular has the drawback of the separation assumption on the eigenvalues .",

    "we see that that the alignment has only little effect under @xmath28 but a rather strong impact under @xmath29 .",
    "we also see that the first standard ( and the first generalized ) principal components are not capturing the large but quite oscillating change - even though the first direction _ explains _ about @xmath165 @xmath166 of the variability in the _ change - contaminated _ data .",
    "this is substantially improved for the aligned counterparts ( in the first row ) which move both , as expected , in the right direction .",
    "note that the generalized empirical principal components would also push the change more into the first component and achieve a comparable effect under a larger sample size or a larger bandwidth .",
    "next , we compare the performance of the test based on change - aligned components with the usual ones , i.e. with the approach considered in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . the critical values are based on the limiting distribution and may be obtained , e.g. , from table 2 of @xcite .",
    "the reported rejection rates in are based on 1000 repetitions .",
    "note that the aligned principal components ensure that the first projection contains _ asymptotically _ all information on _ any _ change @xmath121 ( and sufficient information on any changes @xmath167 ) .",
    "thus , we propose to consider only this direction for testing and choose @xmath168 which has the additional advantage that no selection criteria for @xmath0 is necessary .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , one - dimensional projections are also considered by @xcite .",

    "conclusion_-section that ( random ) projections related to principal components might be of some further interest .",
