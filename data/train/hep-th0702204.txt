    "in order to establish concrete cosmological models which explain inflation , dark energy , and capture the other realistic features that cosmological data require , we need to provide a detailed account of de sitter vacua .",
    "string theory which naturally accommodates gravity beside other known forces of nature produces a vast class of de sitter vacua via compactification down to four dimensions . in a generic compactification",
    "( at large volume and weak coupling ) , one is allowed to turn on various fluxes in the compact dimensions .",
    "the existence of fluxes strongly affects the physics of the four dimensions ( for a comprehensive review on the subject , see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in type iib string theory compactified on a calabi - yau orientifold ,",
    "the allowed fluxes are those associated with rr and ns three - form field strengths .",
    "the resulting low energy effective theory is @xmath0 four dimensional supergravity whose tree level action has the no scale structure @xcite .",
    "the fluxes stabilize the axion - dilaton field and complex structure moduli of the calabi - yau but not the khler moduli . according to kklt scenario , in order to complete the process and fix all moduli , one needs to incorporate the non - perturbative effects to the superpotential @xcite . in this manner",
    ", one can start with the axion - dilaton and complex structure moduli and stabilize them by fluxes at the first step and then introduce the non - perturbative effects to the superpotential and stabilize the khler moduli , as well as the other moduli .",
    "having all moduli stabilized , there are two possible ways to construct de sitter vacua . in the first approach",
    ", one starts with a meta - stable supersymmetric ( the minimization equations for supersymmetric vacua are easier to solve ) anti de sitter vacuum and at the end introduces a stack of anti d3-branes to lift the vacuum to a de sitter one @xcite .",
    "of course , this way requires some amount of fine - tuning in order not to destabilize the vacuum . taking this approach , it is crucial to know about the statistics of meta - stable supersymmetric vacua .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the statistics of these vacua is nicely governed by the khler and ricci forms of the moduli space and this has been supported in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , by considering explicit examples .    the second approach to construct a de sitter vacuum has been proposed and explored for an explicit example in @xcite . in this case",
    ", one starts with a meta - stable de sitter vacuum with stabilized axion - dilaton and complex structure moduli by turning on the fluxes . in the next step ,",
    "non - perturbative effects are included and the khler moduli get stabilized .",
    "the benefit of this method is that it does not need an uplifting process , because we have simply started by a de sitter minimum .",
    "of course , this strategy is not particular to type iib string theory compactification and has also been applied to heterotic m - theory vacua @xcite . in this case , the complex structure moduli are first stabilized at a high scale by @xmath1-flux and , in the next step , the khler moduli are stabilized by incorporating non - perturbative effects coming from different sources , namely the gaugino condensation , @xmath2 and @xmath3 instantons .    taking this approach",
    ", the crucial thing is then studying and analyzing the statistics of meta - stable de sitter vacua before the khler moduli are stabilized .",
    "various aspects of this subject have been investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results shows that the construction of meta - stable de sitter vacua ( even before involving the stabilization of khler moduli ) is hard .",
    "we briefly present the following observations from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the simplest example is first to consider only one complex structure modulus . in the following two limits ,",
    "the stability of the flux vacua has been studied .    *",
    "* large complex structure limit * : in the limit of large complex structure , the only existing yukawa coupling of special geometry is constant and furthermore its covariant derivative vanishes . therefore , the explicit computation which is needed to check the stability of the non - supersymmetric vacua ( in particular de sitter vacua ) is considerably simplified .",
    "the hessian of the potential is a @xmath4 matrix and thus we can easily diagonalize it in terms of its parameters .",
    "the result in @xcite shows that for de sitter vacua , at least , one of the eigenvalues of the hessian of the potential is always negative in all branches of solutions .",
    "this proves that the hessian of the potential is not positive definite and hence it is impossible to obtain any meta - stable de sitter vacuum in the limit of large complex structure . *",
    "* conifold limit * : one might naively think that the result which was obtained in the previous limit ( large complex structure ) is not a general property of de sitter vacua and if one considers other examples , then it might be possible to find meta - stable de sitter vacua . in @xcite , another example , which is more complicated but still calculable , has been investigated . in this example , a calabi - yau with only one complex structure is considered near a generic conifold degeneration . in the vicinity of the origin of the moduli space which is parameterized by the period of the vanishing cycle of the calabi - yau , we only deal with the singular terms and drop all analytic terms . unlike the previous example",
    ", the yukawa coupling of special geometry is not a constant term in this case and further it has a non - vanishing covariant derivative .",
    "if we then proceed and calculate the hessian of the potential at the locus of critical points and find all meta - stable non - supersymmetric vacua in this limit , as it has been done in @xcite , we will find that all those non - supersymmetric vacua are anti de sitter .",
    "therefore , once again , we find that there are no meta - stable de sitter vacua .",
    "it should be emphasized that the two mentioned limits are not two single examples and , in fact , each of them forms a family of examples . because , we did not specified the calabi - yau entirely and we only required that it should possess only one complex structure modulus .",
    "there are many known calabi - yau threefolds which satisfy this condition @xcite .",
    "so far , we may think that this somewhat strange property of de sitter vacua is due to the fact that we have only considered one complex structure modulus . perhaps , it will be possible to find meta - stable de sitter vacua if we allow calabi - yau threefolds which have more complex structure moduli .",
    "unfortunately , the full analysis of the situation is not possible because of various kinds of computational complications which arise by adding more complex structure moduli .",
    "therefore , in order to investigate this new situation , we have to restrict ourselves to a non - generic simple example . in @xcite ,",
    "this situation for an orientifold example has been investigated .    * * case of the orientifold @xmath5 *  : this orbifold has three complex structure moduli , one for each torus @xmath6 .",
    "the only independent non - vanishing component of special geometry yukawa coupling is the one whose all three indices are different and is constant .",
    "moreover , the covariant derivative of this yukawa coupling vanishes . therefore , this example is relatively simple and can be analyzed exactly .",
    "the result in @xcite shows that there are no meta - stable de sitter vacua ( and even no approximately minkowski vacua ) and the mass matrix always has a negative eigenvalue .",
    "of course , the situation can be modified by adding an uplifting d - term , as the authors propose in @xcite .",
    "but before involving any uplifting procedure , it is impossible to find meta - stable de sitter vacua .",
    "the above observations suggest that perhaps there is a deeper fact which prohibits the existence of meta - stable de sitter vacua ( at least for some regions of moduli space ) and we have missed it .",
    "if such a fact exists , it should probably be independent of the characteristics and details of the compact calabi - yau internal space .    of course",
    ", the difficulty of constructing meta - stable de sitter vacua is not particular to flux compactification models and it has also been analyzed in the context of supergravity . in @xcite , the existance of meta - stable non - supersymmetric vacua has been studied for @xmath0 supergravity models and it has been shown that the stability requirement leads to certain constrains on the curvature of the moduli spcae of these theories and the implications of these constraints have been explored for specific examples in @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , we exactly know why it is difficult to construct those vacua in @xmath7 supergravity models . in the absence of hypermultiplets in @xmath7 supergravity , it was first found in @xcite that the holomorphic - antiholomorphic part of the mass matrix is always tachyonic ( it has , at least , one negative eigenvalue ) for de sitter vacua .",
    "this implies that the mass matrix is not positive definite and therefore , any de sitter vacuum is perturbatively unstable .",
    "the proof of this theorem , which has clearly been explained in @xcite , only relies on the special geometry structure of the vector multiplet .",
    "consequently , if we consider four - dimensional @xmath7 supergravity as an embedding theory of type iib string theory compactified on a calabi - yau threefold ( without turning the fluxes on ) , then this theorem states that it is impossible to construct any meta - stable de sitter vacuum regardless of the details of the topology and geometry of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that , in fact , similar theorems exist for flux compactifications in certain limits and , at least , partially answer the earlier question of why constructing stable de sitter vacua is very difficult . in this manner , we exclude some regions of moduli space for which there is no hope to find meta - stable de sitter vacua .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the essential ingredients and backgrounds for f - theory flux compactification on a calabi - yau fourfold .",
    "we then take the denef - douglas model of landscape of string vacua , in which one neglects the khler moduli and restricts oneself to complex structures and the axion - dilaton .",
    "in fact , we ignore the no scale structure of supergravity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of the landscape of vacua of this model is important if we consider the supersymmetric vacua of this model as the starting point of kklt construction @xcite and de sitter vacua of this model for the starting point of the scenario which was proposed in @xcite . in either scenarios @xcite , @xcite , the no scale structure of supergravity is ultimately broken and the khler moduli get stabilized as well as complex structures . if the construction of de sitter vacua is possible , then the proposal in @xcite may even seem more attractive than the kklt construction , since it does not require adding any anti d3-branes at the end to uplift the anti de sitter vacuum to a de sitter one .    in section 3 ,",
    "we find the hessian of the flux potential .",
    "we organize different sectors of the hessian of the potential such that it becomes a hermitian matrix . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the stability of the critical points of the potential in the limit where supersymmetry is dominantly broken by the contribution of the axion - dilaton .",
    "the reason we have to restrict ourselves to a limit is that if we consider the simplest example of this type in which there exists only one complex structure modulus , we find that even this example is complicated enough that no result can be extracted in general , without considering any limit .",
    "therefore , we need to analyze the problem in different regions of moduli space separately . in this paper , we focus on this specific limit ( the dilaton dominated limit ) because of two reasons .",
    "first , to obtain a de sitter vacuum without d - term uplifting , we should allow supersymmetry breaking parameters ( @xmath8 ) to compete with the value of the superpotential .",
    "secondly , it has been proved in @xcite that all soft supersymmetry breaking terms are universal in the dilaton dominated limit and do not depend on any specific feature of the model .    in section 4.1 , for stable non - degenerate critical points ,",
    "we first require the positivity of the hessian of the potential at the critical points .",
    "since the hessian of the potential is a hermitian matrix , it is necessary for any principal submatrix of the hessian to be positive definite .",
    "therefore , as a necessary but not sufficient condition the holomorphic - antiholomorphic sector of the hessian must be positive definite by itself .",
    "however , we find one the eigenvalues of this sector of the hessian is proportional to the minus of a mixture of cosmological constant and supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "this implies that it would be impossible to find meta - stable de sitter vacua in the regions of the moduli space which correspond to dilaton dominated limit .",
    "moreover , the stability requirement gives us a bound for the scale of supersymmetry breaking for non - supersymmetric meta - stable anti de sitter vacua in this limit .",
    "using the similarity between the mathematical structure of flux vacua and non - supersymmetric black hole attractors , we argue , in section 4.2 , that degenerate critical points can not be stable for generic fluxes , although it might be possible to achieve some meta - stable de sitter vacua by fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "we will investigate the consequences of the obtained results on the statistics of meta - stable de sitter vacua in section 5 .",
    "we show that the limit we considered in section 4 defines certain regions of moduli space which should eventually be excluded when looking for meta - stable de sitter vacua . in section 6",
    ", we explain that this stability condition is true only for non - supersymmetric vacua and is not applicable for supersymmetric vacua .",
    "therefore , this point might be useful for the current attempts for finding appropriate criteria to distinguish between the landscape of string vacua and the swampland @xcite .",
    "section 7 is devoted to discussions and concluding thoughts .",
    "in this section , we briefly review f - theory flux compactification on an elliptically fibered calabi - yau fourfold @xmath9 in the orientifold limit in which @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a calabi - yau threefold . in the language of type iib string theory , this is equivalent to compactifying on the orientifold limit of @xmath11 with a constant axion - dilaton .",
    "the resulting low energy four - dimensional effective theory is @xmath0 supergravity whose information is encoded by a flux superpotential @xmath12 and a khler potential @xmath13 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that both flux superpotential @xmath12 and khler potential @xmath13 only depend on complex structure moduli of @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the complex structure moduli space of @xmath9 as @xmath14 which is a complex khler manifold . because of the product structure of @xmath9 ,",
    "@xmath14 is identified with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the moduli space of complex structures of @xmath11 and @xmath17 is the moduli space of elliptic curves which corresponds to the space of possible values for the axion - dilaton @xmath18 .",
    "another way of saying this is that we have ignored the khler moduli of @xmath11 .",
    "the reason we can do this is that if we incorporate the non - perturbative effects which are present in string theory @xcite , the no - scale structure of the tree level action of supergravity is then broken and khler moduli can essentially be stabilized .",
    "the potential term in effective lagrangian of @xmath0 supergravity theory , in the planckian units set equal to one , is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 refers to axion - dilaton @xmath18 and @xmath21 to complex structures of @xmath11 .",
    "the covariant derivative is constructed with respect to the khler connection of a line bundle @xmath22 ( whose first chern class is @xmath23=[\\omega]$ ] , where @xmath24 is a khler form defined on @xmath14 ) over @xmath14 and they are contracted via the weil - petersson metric derived from the khler potential .",
    "+ the khler potential of the four - dimensional theory is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a nowhere vanishing holomorphic four form defined on @xmath9 . in the orientifold limit , we can easily express @xmath26 in terms of an appropriate holomorphic three form @xmath27 of the calabi - yau threefold @xmath11 and the holomorphic one form @xmath28 of the torus @xmath6 as @xmath29 . doing so , the khler potential takes the form of the r.h.s . of ( [ kahler - pot ] ) . to be more explicit",
    ", we can choose a basis for the space of harmonic one forms on @xmath6 and rewrite @xmath28 in terms of that basis .",
    "suppose @xmath30 are canonical harmonic one forms on @xmath6 and form a basis for @xmath31 such that we can rewrite @xmath32 .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is that part of khler potential which comes from the torus @xmath36 , and finally @xmath37 is the levi - civita connection for the khler metric on the torus . the complex structure moduli space of @xmath11 , @xmath16 , is a khler manifold which enjoys special geometry @xcite . if we define a holomorphic symmetric three - tensor @xmath38 componentwise as @xmath39 , then the special geometry structure of @xmath16 tells us @xmath40 in the physics literature , @xmath41 is often known as the special geometry yukawa coupling .",
    "furthermore , special geometry gives a relation between the curvature of the tangent bundle of @xmath16 and the yukawa couplings as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the khler potential on @xmath16 and @xmath44 is the corresponding khler metric .",
    "the flux superpotential @xmath12 is defined as a section of the line bundle @xmath22 by @xcite , @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the quantized four form flux and can be written as @xmath47 , in which the harmonic three forms @xmath48 and @xmath49 are identified with rr and ns - ns type iib fluxes respectively .    given a complex structure for the fourfold @xmath9 , we have a natural hodge decomposition as @xmath50 since @xmath9 has a product structure , we can determine the dimension of each of the above subspaces in terms of the hodge numbers of the calabi - yau threefold @xmath11 and the torus @xmath6 . using the kunneth decomposition formula and @xmath51 are two complex manifolds , then the following isomorphism is held @xmath52 as an immediate consequence for dimensions of the cohomology spaces , we have the following relation between the hodge numbers of @xmath53 , @xmath51 , and @xmath54 @xmath55 ] , we easily find @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the dimension of the complex structure moduli space of @xmath11 .",
    "we can go further and find an explicit basis for each of these subspaces . due to griffiths transversality",
    "( more details can be found in the appendix ) , covariant derivatives of any @xmath60-form @xmath61 defined on @xmath9 ( @xmath62 ) belong to @xmath63 therefore , the covariant derivative of the holomorphic four form @xmath26 has two pieces @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "however , the @xmath66 part vanishes because @xmath67 and hence , @xmath68 is a purely @xmath69 form . using ( [ griffith ] ) , we can express @xmath70 . with the same technique , we can see that @xmath71 vanishes since @xmath72 .",
    "this then implies that @xmath73 is a purely @xmath74 form .",
    "we can use covariant derivatives of @xmath26 to form basis for cohomology spaces ( [ hodge - dec ] ) as following @xmath75 in this case , it is quite easy to see that the flux form @xmath76 has the following hodge decomposition @xmath77 furthermore , the flux form @xmath76 is subject to the tadpole cancelation condition @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the number of d3 and anti - d3 branes .",
    "of course , @xmath81 can not be made indefinitely large by adding any number of anti - d3 branes since the system will decay into a system of flux and d3 branes system .",
    "in order to check the stability of the critical points of the flux potential ( [ pot ] ) , we first need to find the hessian of the potential . in this section , we find all elements of the hessian .",
    "since we want to argue about the stability of the vacua at the position of the critical points after all , we calculate the second order covariant derivatives of the potential instead of the ordinary derivatives .",
    "it is clear that because of ( [ holo1form ] ) and ( [ holo3form ] ) , all second order covariant derivatives of the superpotential are not independent of each other and we have the following relations @xmath82 where we have defined @xmath83 .",
    "another useful formula is the commutation relation between holomorphic and antiholomorphic covariant derivatives .",
    "we can prove a generic formula for this case and use it whenever it is needed to commute covariant derivatives acting on a general object .",
    "assuming @xmath84 which has the holomorphic - antiholomorphic khler weights @xmath85 , the commutation relation of @xmath86 and @xmath87 acting on @xmath88 is then given by @xmath89p_{c_{1}\\cdots c_{m}\\bar{d}_{1}\\cdots\\bar{d}_{n}}&=&(h_{p}-\\bar{h}_{p})g_{a\\bar{b } } p_{c_{1}\\cdots c_{m}\\bar{d}_{1}\\cdots\\bar{d}_{n}}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m}{\\mathcal{r}}^{e_{i}}_{a\\bar{b}c_{i}}p_{c_{1}\\cdots e_{i}\\cdots c_{m}\\bar{d}_{1}\\cdots\\bar{d}_{m}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{\\mathcal{r}}^{\\bar{e}_{j}}_{\\bar{b}a\\bar{d}_{j } } p_{c_{1}\\cdots c_{m}\\bar{d}_{1}\\cdots\\bar{e}_{j}\\cdots\\bar{d}_{n}}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the curvature of the tangent bundle of the moduli space @xmath14 as the base manifold .",
    "we notice that if we exchange the position of @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the above relation , then the positions of @xmath91 and @xmath92 are also exchanged in the r.h.s . of ( [ ddbar ] ) , so that the skew - symmetry property of the commutator is preserved . putting all these relations together",
    ", we are now able to compute all derivatives of the potential .",
    "we first calculate the first order derivatives of the flux potential ( [ pot ] ) @xmath93 where we have used ( [ ddw1 ] ) in deriving ( [ dv1 ] ) , and ( [ ddw2 ] ) together with a special case of ( [ ddbar ] ) acting on @xmath12 with khler weight ( 1,0 ) for ( [ dv2 ] ) .",
    "now , we want to compute second order derivatives of the potential which form the elements of the hessian .",
    "since we are interested to evaluate the hessian of the potential at the position of a critical point and because @xmath94 holds for any critical point @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , we can instead calculate the second order covariant derivatives of the potential , which manifestly respect the covariant form of the equations .",
    "the hessian of the potential is a square @xmath97 dimensional hermitian matrix @xmath98 using ( [ dv1 ] ) , ( [ dv2 ] ) , and other techniques we introduced in this section , we can calculate all elements of the hessian of the potential .",
    "these relations have also been computed in @xcite in an orthonormal frame ( tangent space ) of the moduli space , which admits a diagonal flat metric .",
    "the holomorphic - holomorphic elements of the hessian are given by @xmath99 we do not need these elements of the hessian for the rest of the paper and they have been mentioned only for completeness purposes .",
    "however , we do need the holomorphic - antiholomorphic elements of the hessian for our purpose and they are given by @xmath100 we notice that the above expressions for the elements of the hessian , ( [ ddv1])-([ddv7 ] ) , are generic and they are valid everywhere ( not only at critical points ) .",
    "after finding the critical points of the flux potential , we should find out whether they are perturbatively stable .",
    "in other words , we should make sure that any vacuum is a local minimum in each direction of the moduli space .",
    "if the hessian of the potential is tachyonic and has at least one negative eigenvalue at a critical point , then the critical point is not a local minimum and therefore , it can not be regarded as a meta - stable vacuum .",
    "we consider degenerate and non - degenerate critical points of the potential separately in the following two subsections .    here , in section 4.1 , we assume that the contribution to supersymmetry breaking parameter is dominated by the axion - dilaton and the contribution of f - terms associated with complex structure moduli is small in comparison with it .",
    "more precisely , what we assume is that @xmath101 .",
    "later in section 5 , we discuss the consequences of this limit and will figure out that it corresponds to particular regions in moduli space .",
    "in fact , we will show that it is impossible to find any meta - stable de sitter vacuum in those regions of moduli space which correspond to this limit and therefore they should be excluded .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the context of four dimensional heterotic string theory , this condition is well motivated by reasons coming from phenomenology . in @xcite ,",
    "a string theory motivated parametrization of supersymmetry breaking parameters of the supersymmetric standard model is provided . in a simple example",
    ", it is assumed that there is only one f - term in addition to the one associated with the axion - dilaton .",
    "the goldstino angle is then defined as the ratio of @xmath102 .",
    "the limit @xmath103 corresponds to dilaton dominated supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the important feature of dilaton dominated limit is that all soft parameter terms are universal and independent of the details of the model .",
    "as @xmath104 decreases , the model dependence of the soft terms increases and the resulting soft terms may not be universal anymore .",
    "this construction is , of course , in the framework of heterotic string . for the case of type iib string theory",
    ", one can consult @xcite for details of the dilaton domination .      in this section",
    ", we work with non - degenerate critical points of the potential . in the next part",
    ", we will discuss the stability of degenerate critical points . according to ( [ dv1 ] ) and ( [ dv2 ] ) , for any critical point of the potential ( @xmath105 ) we have @xmath106 we notice that any quantity in this section is evaluated at the position of a non - degenerate critical point @xmath95 of the potential @xmath107 , for which we have ( @xmath96 and @xmath108 ) .",
    "we drop the letter @xmath109 to show that the value at the critical point but it should automatically be understood .",
    "if a non - degenerate critical point of the potential is a local minimum ( meta - stable ) , then the hessian of the potential must be a positive definite matrix at the position of the critical point ( the morse index of the critical point should be zero . ) .",
    "since @xmath110 is a hermitian matrix , it is positive definite if and only if every principal submatrix of @xmath110 is positive definite[multiblock footnote omitted ] . in particular , if we consider the holomorphic - antiholomorphic block of the hessian , which is a square @xmath111 dimensional leading principal submatrix of @xmath112 , then this block by itself must be positive definite .",
    "now , we want to investigate whether the holomorphic - antiholomorphic part of the hessian is positive definite at the position of the critical point @xmath109 .    in the limit where @xmath101 , the elements of the holomorphic - antiholomorphic part of the hessian of the potential , ( [ ddv4])-([ddv7 ] ) , are given by @xmath113 in above expressions",
    ", we have kept the first order terms in @xmath114 , but we have neglected second order terms @xmath115 .",
    "now , we claim that @xmath116 is an eigenvector of the the holomorphic - antiholomorphic part of the hessian of the potential at the critical point . by proving this statement , i. e. @xmath117",
    ", we will also determine the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath118 .",
    "first , we start with the zeroth component of the eigenvalue equation @xmath119 in first line of the above equation ( [ eigen1 ] ) , we have substituted the expressions ( [ ddv - limit1 ] ) and ( [ ddv - limit2 ] ) for holomorphic - antiholomorphic elements of the hessian .",
    "we have also used ( [ dv=02 ] ) in the second line and ( [ dv=01 ] ) in order to get the last line . in the second line",
    ", we also get a term @xmath120 which is negligible in this limit . for the @xmath121-th component of the eigenvalue equation",
    ", we have @xmath122 we have substituted ( [ ddv - limit3 ] ) and ( [ ddv - limit4 ] ) for the r.h.s . of the second equality .",
    "if we use ( [ dv=01 ] ) and ( [ dv=02 ] ) for the the last two terms of the second equality respectively , we will obtain r.h.s .",
    "of the third equality which results the last line , using ( [ dv=02 ] ) again .",
    "therefore , we find that @xmath116 is , indeed , one of the eigenvectors of the holomorphic - antiholomorphic part of the hessian at the position of the critical points of the potential with corresponding eigenvalue @xmath123 . if we rewrite the eigenvalue @xmath118 in terms of the critical value of potential @xmath124 , we have @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the cosmological constant ( the critical value of @xmath107 ) and @xmath127 is the mass of gravitino ( scale of supersymmetry breaking ) .",
    "first , it should be noticed that this equation does not give us any information about supersymmetric vacua , because the eigenvector @xmath116 will be the zero vector for supersymmetric vacua and thus ( [ eigen3 ] ) is trivially satisfied . however , this relation ( eq . ( [ eigen3 ] ) ) has important consequences for non - supersymmetric vacua .",
    "it implies that    * for any de sitter vacuum ( @xmath128 ) , the holomorphic - antiholomorphic part of the hessian of the potential has a negative definite eigenvalue and therefore , the complete hessian is not a positive definite matrix .",
    "this means that any de sitter vacuum is perturbatively unstable . *",
    "any non - supersymmetric minkowski vacuum ( @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) is also unstable .",
    "we notice that this statement is not valid when the superpotential vanishes at locus of the critical point . because in this case the vacuum is supersymmetric and for supersymmetric vacua , ( [ eigen3 ] ) is trivially satisfied .",
    "* for any non - supersymmetric meta - stable anti de sitter ( @xmath131 ) , there is relation between the value of the cosmological constant and the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "in fact , there is a lower bound for the value of the supersymmetry breaking scale in any meta - stable anti de sitter vacuum : @xmath132 .",

    "another interesting feature of this bound is that demanding small value of cosmological constant is correlated with having low scale of supersymmetry breaking .      in this section",
    ", we argue that degenerate critical points are not perturbatively stable for a generic set of fluxes . for degenerate critical points",
    ", the determinant of hessian of the potential ( [ hessian ] ) vanishes at the locus of the critical points and we have to take higher order perturbations into account .",

    "however , if all cubic terms also vanish along the degenerate directions of moduli space , we have a chance to find a local minimum ( or maximum ) by quartic terms of the expansion .",
    "the same phenomenon happens in the context of non - supersymmetric black hole attractors .",
    "the mathematical structure of these black holes , which appear as four - dimensional solutions of @xmath7 supergravity as the low energy effective theory of type iia string theory compactified on a calabi - yau threefold , is very similar to the mathematical structure governed on flux compactification @xcite .",
    "it turns out that supersymmetric black holes are perturbatively stable as a result of special geometry .",
    "however , this statement is no longer true for non - supersymmetric black holes and one needs to check the stability of the critical points explicitly .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite non - supersymmetric black hole solutions for generic electric and magnetic charges which correspond to charges of even branes wrapping on appropriate cycles are degenerate critical points of the black hole potential . therefore , to check the stability of these solutions , it is necessary to consider the higher order terms .",
    "it is shown @xcite that the cubic terms do not vanish for a generic set of electric and magnetic charges and thus the solutions are not stable in general .",
    "but if we consider a specific set of charges , for example if only d2-d6 brane charges exist ( or d0-d4 brane charges which is , in fact , dual to d2-d6 brane system by electric - magnetic duality ) , then all cubic terms in the expansion of the black hole potential vanish .",
    "hence for this specific configuration ( d2-d6 brane system ) , one should consider the quartic terms in the expansion .",
    "the result shows @xcite that all coefficients of quartic terms in the expansion along degenerate directions of the moduli space are positive and eventually non - supersymmetric solutions of d2-d6 brane system are stable .    by analogy between the mathematical structure of flux compactification and black hole attractors ,",
    "we conclude that for generic set of fluxes there is no reason to believe that the cubic terms should vanish in the expansion of the flux potential in terms of moduli fields around a degenerate critical point .",
    "this would imply that the degenerate critical point is an inflection point in some directions of moduli space and therefore it can not be stable .",
    "nevertheless , it might be possible to find stable degenerate critical points by choosing specific fluxes .",
    "in that situation , it is necessary for all coefficients of cubic terms to vanish along degenerate directions .",
    "furthermore , all quartic terms must be positive in the expansion , as in the example of non - supersymmetric black hole attractors .",
    "in this section , we analyze the consequences of the result we obtained in the previous section , namely ( [ eigen3 ] ) , on the statistics of non - supersymmetric and , in particular , de sitter vacua . but before doing that it would be instructive first to consider the analysis which has been done in @xcite for the statistics of non - supersymmetric vacua in the regime of a small supersymmetry breaking parameter . as we will see in below , the stability requirement leads to a mild constraint in this regime whereas in our case it leads to a stringent constraint .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the critical points of the flux potential correspond to the eigenvectors of a square @xmath134-dimensional hermitian matrix @xmath135 @xmath136 with the eigenvalue @xmath137 , in which @xmath138 is defined as the phase of the superpotential @xmath139 .",
    "then the hessian of the potential can be expanded in powers of @xmath116 as @xmath140 where the first term in above is the zeroth order term in @xmath116 and the second and third terms are the first and second order terms of the expansion respectively .",
    "now , we restrict ourselves to the region of moduli space @xmath14 in which @xmath116 is very small .",
    "this region of moduli space corresponds to almost supersymmetric solutions ( see figure 1 ) . without fine - tuning , these non - supersymmetric solutions are anti de sitter vacua , because @xmath12 is of order of one ( in planckian units ) for a generic flux , which implies @xmath141 . in other words , since in this limit , the value of the superpotential is dominant in the flux potential , it is not possible to obtain critical points with positive critical value of the potential and this has nothing to do with the stability requirement . as a result , there exists no de sitter vacuum for generic fluxes in this limit unless one uplifts the vacua by introducing d - terms , as it has been proposed in @xcite . here",
    ", let us continue the analysis of these anti - de sitter vacua without involving d - terms for uplifting .    for this regime ( almost supersymmetric vacua )",
    ", we can ignore the first and second order terms in @xmath116 in ( [ d2vdw ] ) .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalues of @xmath135 can be regarded as _ approximate _ eigenvalues of the hessian . in this case , in order to analyze the stability of the vacua in this limit , it is sufficient to analyze the eigenvalues of @xmath135 .",
    "because of special form of @xmath135 , ( [ m - matrix ] ) , the eigenvalues of @xmath135 appear as pairs of @xmath142 , where @xmath143 .",
    "we can reorder these eigenvalues such that @xmath144 . according to ( [ d2vdw ] )",
    ", the requirement to obtain a positive definite hessian is that the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath135 should be greater than @xmath137 , namely @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , we only need to be worried about one eigenvalue .",
    "if @xmath145 , then @xmath110 will not have any tachyonic mode and the vacuum is perturbatively stable . in case @xmath146 , the zeroth order term in ( [ d2vdw ] ) vanishes and the first order term will determine whether or not the vacua are stable .",
    "the analysis in @xcite shows that it requires some amount of fine - tuning .    after all , since the stability of the vacua depends on the value of only one of the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath135 , the probability to find a meta - stable non - supersymmetric vacuum is @xmath147 . notice that this estimate is much bigger than the naive probability one may think .",
    "since @xmath135 has @xmath134 eigenvalues , there is , at least for a uniform distribution of vacua , a fifty - fifty percent chance in order to get a positive eigenvalue in each direction of moduli space based on general grounds .",
    "therefore , the probability to find a typical non - supersymmetric stable vacuum is @xmath148 which is much less than @xmath147 , as we already mentioned . finally , the bottom line is that the stability requirement leads to a mild constraint on the number of non - supersymmetric vacua in the limit of very low supersymmetry breaking parameter .",

    "both sides of the equality vanish since the eigenvector vanishes .",

    "in the preceding sections , we have studied the statistics of meta - stable de sitter vacua in specific regions of moduli space and we have addressed important features of this analysis and some other related issues .",

    "but at the end one needs to uplift the anti de sitter vacuum to a de sitter one by introducing a stack of anti d3-branes , which requires some amount of fine tuning in order not to destabilize the vacuum @xcite .",

    "it turns out that if supersymmetry is dominantly broken by the dilaton , then all soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are universal and model independent @xcite . the main features of this limit are maintained in type iib string theory as well @xcite .    in this limit",
    "( dilaton dominated ) , we proved that for non - degenerate critical points the holomorphic - antiholomorphic part of the mass matrix has an eigenvalue proportional to minus the sum of the value of cosmological constant and the square of the gravitino mass .",
    "this implies that the hessian of the flux potential can not be positive definite and always has at least one negative eigenvalue for positive critical values . for the degenerate critical points , we argued by the analogy between the mathematical structure of flux vacua and non - supersymmetric black hole attractors , it is impossible to have perturbatively stable degenerate critical points unless one does a significant amount of fine - tuning .",
    "after all , the conclusion is that there is no meta - stable de sitter vacua in this limit .",
    "this means that the idea of treating axion - dilaton differently from complex structures does not lead to any meta - stable de sitter vacuum without uplifting .",

    "<S> we consider flux compactification of type iib string theory as the orientifold limit of an f - theory on a calabi - yau fourfold . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when supersymmetry is dominantly broken by the axion - dilaton and the contributions of the f - terms associated with complex structure moduli are small , the hessian of the flux potential always has tachyonic modes for de sitter vacua . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that there exist no meta - stable de sitter vacua in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that the stability requirement imposes a relation between the values of cosmological constant and the scale of supersymmetry breaking for non - supersymmetric anti de sitter vacua in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> the proof is general and does not rely on the details of the geometry of the compact calabi - yau internal space . </S>",
    "<S> we finally analyze the consequences of these constraints on the statistics of meta - stable de sitter vacua and address some other related issues .    </S>",
