    "in 1993 , r. fintushel and r. stern introduced the _ rational blow - down _ of smooth 4-manifolds , a surgical procedure consisting of removing the interior of a negative - definite simply connected smooth 4-manifold @xmath1 embedded in a closed smooth 4-manifold @xmath2 and replacing it with a rational homology ball .",
    "they also studied the effect of this process on both the donaldson and the seiberg - witten invariants ( @xcite ) .",
    "several years later , j. park extended their results to more general configurations @xmath3 , thus defining the _ generalized rational blow - down _ , and computed how the seiberg - witten invariants change under this operation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first technique was used by park in constructing an exotic smooth structure on @xmath4 ( @xcite ) , while the second was applied by park , stipsicz and szab in constructing exotic smooth structures on @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "more recently , in @xcite and @xcite , d. gay , a. stipsicz , z. szab and j. wahl extended further the above procedures , this time along certain negative - definite plumbing trees , while in @xcite , l. roberts studied the rational blow - down along the branched double cover @xmath7 of @xmath0 along alternating , slice knots k in @xmath0 and its effect on the ozsvth - szab 4-manifold invariant .",
    "+ in this paper , we turn to study the rational blow - down operation along 3-manifolds that arise as branched double covers of @xmath0 along non - alternating , slice knots .",
    "we narrow our attention down to knots with up to ten crossings and then the knots @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the only ones with the desired properties ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "first , we study the mirrors of some of these knots , specifically @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are also non - alternating and slice .",
    "the branched double covers of @xmath0 along these ( denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively ) bound negative - definite 4-manifolds as well as rational homology balls .",
    "the existence of such balls is guaranteed by the fact that the knots are slice , but we also find explicit descriptions of them using @xcite . using the results in @xcite and @xcite , we show that the 3-manifolds @xmath14 , @xmath15 , are l - spaces and we then move on to write rational blow - down formulas along them , applying the results of roberts in @xcite .",
    "we note that the 3-manifolds @xmath14 , @xmath16 , along which we perform the rational blow - down do not belong in any of the categories @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 described in @xcite . in the next to last section of the paper , we briefly discuss the cases of the branched double covers of @xmath0 along @xmath24 and @xmath9 and in the last section , we present how the relationship between heegaard - floer homology and khovanov homology can be used to draw some of the above conclusions over @xmath25 instead of @xmath26 . +",

    "let us start by introducing some terminology .",
    "consider a graph @xmath27 .",
    "the * _ degree _ * of a vertex @xmath28 of @xmath27 , denoted @xmath29 , is the number of edges which contain @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath27 is equipped with an integer valued function @xmath30 on its vertices , then it is called a * _ weighted graph _ * and if @xmath28 is a vertex of such a graph , then @xmath31 is called the * _ multiplicity _ * of @xmath28 .",
    "a vertex @xmath28 of a weighted graph @xmath27 is called * _ bad _ * if @xmath32    a weighted graph @xmath27 gives rise to a 4-manifold @xmath33 with boundary @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath33 is obtained as follows : on each vertex @xmath28 of @xmath27 consider a @xmath35-bundle over @xmath36 with euler class @xmath31 .",
    "whenever two vertices @xmath28 and @xmath37 are joined by an edge , `` plumb '' the corresponding disk bundles , i.e. pick a small disk ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) on each sphere so that the disk bundle over it is a product ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and then identify @xmath40 with @xmath41 using a map that preserves the product structures but interchanges the factors .    for @xmath33 as above , @xmath42 is the lattice spanned by the vertices of g and if @xmath43 $ ] is the homology class corresponding to the vertex @xmath28 , then the intersection form @xmath44 is given by : @xmath45,[v])=m(v)$ ] and @xmath45,[w])=1 $ ] @xmath46 if the vertices @xmath28 and @xmath37 are ( are not ) connected by an edge .",

    "then a `` mixed invariant '' @xmath69 can be defined by combining @xmath70 and @xmath71 in an appropriate way ( using the identification @xmath72 ) .",

    "the notion of an l - space is a generalization of that of a lens space .",
    "the precise definition is as follows ( @xcite ) :    a closed 3-manifold y is called an * _ l - space _ * if @xmath98 and @xmath99 is a free abelian group with rank equal to @xmath100 , the number of elements in @xmath101 .",

    ", it suffices to notice that @xmath91 is slice and the branched cover of @xmath123 along the slice disk is a rational homology ball .",
    "we mention here that whether a knot is slice or not can be read off from its smooth four genus , which has been computed for all knots up to ten crossings and is listed on the corresponding knot tables . for the specific case of the knot @xmath124 that we are studying here ,",
    "the interested reader is refered to page 86 of @xcite for a concrete description of the slice disc .",
    "in fact , @xmath48 is one of the manifolds listed in @xcite , it is the manifold @xmath125 in category ( 5 ) with p=3 and s=-1 .",
    "thus , we can explicitly describe a 2-handle addition to @xmath126 along a circle in @xmath127 that leads to a manifold with boundary @xmath128 and eventually , after attaching a 3- and a 4-handle , to a rational homology ball @xmath122 with boundary @xmath48 .",
    "we proceed to do so .",
    "first note that @xmath48 can be alternatively represented as in figure [ 6 ] .    ]    then , there is a 2-handle addition depicted in the first part of figure [ 14 ] at the end of the paper that has as end product the last manifold of this figure , which , according to the lemma in page 26 of @xcite , is homeomorphic to @xmath129",

    "first , we will make use of the calculations of the heegaard floer homology groups for 3-manifolds obtained by plumbings of spheres specified by certain graphs carried out in section 3 of @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that of the 48 characteristic vectors @xmath138 , after applying the algorithm described in section 3 of @xcite , only 9 initiate a path ending at a vector @xmath105 satisfying @xmath139 @xmath140 these are the following : @xmath141 + @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "this , together with the fact that @xmath144 , provides an * _ alternative proof of the fact that @xmath48 is an l - space_*.    next , we need to check which of the above 9 vectors representing @xmath51 structures on @xmath48 extend to the rational homology ball . figure [ 7 ] illustrates the first few steps of computing the enhanced intersection form after the 2-handle addition that we presented at the end of section 3.3 .",
    "we leave it as an exercise to the reader to carry out the next few steps and we only record here the outcome of this process :    @xmath145    with @xmath146 the @xmath51 structures that extend are represented by vectors that are orthogonal to the kernel of the enhanced intesection form , that is satisfy @xmath147 it is easy to see that only 3 of these vectors , specifically ( 0,0,0,0,3),(0,0,0,2,1 ) and ( 0,0,2,0,-1 ) , satisfy the equation @xmath148 and thus can be extended to the rational homology ball .",

    ". we will apply theorem 2 of @xcite , so we only need to check that @xmath48 satisfies the three conditions listed there .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath48 is a rational homology sphere , so it remains to check the last two conditions . for the second condition ,",
    "recall that there is a long exact sequence @xmath158 and that the 3-manifold invariant @xmath159 is defined as @xmath160 .",
    "but @xmath48 is an l - space , so the map @xmath161 is trivial , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "hence the second condition of the theorem holds as well . finally , the third condition requires @xmath164 to be a sleek negative - definite 4-manifold .",
    "this is true according to the results in @xcite , given that @xmath130 is a negative - definite graph with only one bad vertex .      at this point",
    ", we present a different approach to studying which of the @xmath51 structures extend to the rational homology ball .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it does not require a concrete description of the rational homology ball .",
    "fix a @xmath51 structure @xmath77 over @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath165 since the graph @xmath130 that we are presently studying has only one bad vertex . by proposition 3.2 of @xcite",
    "the maximum is always achieved among the characteristic vectors in @xmath166 which have coordinates in @xmath167 and initiate paths with final vectors satisfying the equations ( [ 16.1 ] ) and ( [ 16.2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , if a @xmath51 structure @xmath77 extends across a rational homology ball , then @xmath168 .",
    "this follows from the more general statement proven in proposition 9.9 of @xcite that if @xmath169 and @xmath170 are rational homology cobordant rational homology 3-spheres equipped with @xmath51 structures , then @xmath171 .",
    "we compute the square of the nine vectors above and only @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 have square equal to -5 .",
    "therefore these give the only candidates for @xmath51 structures that extend .",
    "moreover , we were already expecting precisely @xmath175 @xmath51 structures to extend , according to the arguments presented in lemma 2 of @xcite .",
    "we restate this here and then use it to justify our claim .",

    "the cases of the remaining three knots among the seven listed in the introduction ( i.e. @xmath274 , @xmath275 and @xmath9 ) are still to be studied , since the techniques used in this paper are inconclusive for these examples .",
    "in this last section , we discuss some conclusions regarding our constructions that can be drawn from the relationship between heegaard - floer homology and khovanov homology .      in @xcite , m. khovanov presented an algorithm that computes an invariant of knots and links .",
    "given a link @xmath105 , this invariant is a bigraded homology theory @xmath276 ( strictly speaking cohomology theory , since the boundary map increases the homological grading by 1 ) that categorifies the jones polynomial , in the sense that its graded euler characteristic is the unnormalized jones polynomial of the link : @xmath277 we confine our presentation here to mentioning that the starting point in defining @xmath276 is to use the state - sum expression for the unnormalized jones polynomial @xmath278 .",
    "in addition to the homology groups @xmath279 , _ reduced homology _ groups @xmath280 can be defined by tensoring the original chain complex with @xmath104 , where @xmath281 is the one - dimensional representation of the base ring @xmath21 , to obtain a reduced chain complex .",
    "the euler characteristic of @xmath282 is the jones polynomial : @xmath283        as it turns out ( @xcite ) , all but 12 of the 249 knots with at most 10 crossings are h - thin and for these knots the homology groups are supported on the diagonals @xmath287 , where @xmath288 denotes the signature of the knot .",
    "moreover , both the jones and the alexander polynomials are alternating and the groups @xmath280 lie on one diagonal .",
    "consequently , for these knots the dimensions of @xmath280 are given by the absolute values of the coefficients of @xmath289 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we make the following observations concerning the mirror image @xmath290 of a slice , h - thin knot @xmath291 . according to @xcite , for @xmath291 oriented knot and integers @xmath292 , there are equalities of isomorphism classes of abelian groups",
    "@xmath293 @xmath294 we saw in the previous section that for an h - thin knot @xmath291 the khovanov homology is supported in the diagonals @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",
    "if @xmath291 is also slice , then it has signature @xmath297 and so the khovanov homology of an h - thin and slice knot @xmath291 is supported in the diagonals @xmath298 and @xmath299 . from equation ( [ k mirror ] ) it follows that the non - torsion part of @xmath300 is also supported in the same diagonals . from equation ( [ k mirror 2 ] )",
    "it follows that the torsion part of @xmath301 in the @xmath299 diagonal gives a torsion part in the same diagonal for @xmath300 while the torsion part of @xmath301 in the @xmath298 diagonal gives a torsion part in the line @xmath302 for @xmath300 .    for our examples of knots , that is @xmath303 @xmath304 @xmath305 and @xmath306",
    ", we read off from the knot table ( @xcite ) that these knots are h - thin and that torsion appears only on the @xmath299 diagonal and thus we can conclude that the mirror knots @xmath307 @xmath308 @xmath243 and @xmath11 are also h - thin .",
    "we start by studying @xmath90 . we know that @xmath310 and @xmath311 ( see @xcite for a discussion on this ) and @xmath312 because @xmath313 and @xmath314 gives the euler characteristic of @xmath315 according to proposition 5.1 of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath316 ( where both ranks refer to homology with @xmath25 coefficients ) as there exists a spectral sequence with @xmath317 term @xmath318 with @xmath25 coefficients and @xmath319 term @xmath320 ( @xcite ) and @xmath321 .",
    "lastly , according to corollary 2 of @xcite the dimensions of the reduced homology groups for an h - thin knot are given by the absolute values of the coefficients of it s jones polynomial and @xmath322 giving that @xmath323 combining all the above relations in the order presented , we get that @xmath324 which translates to the fact that @xmath325 is an l - space over @xmath25 .",
