    "pseudogap formation in the electronic spectrum of underdoped copper oxides is especially striking anomaly of the normal state of high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "discussions on the nature of the pseudogap state continue within two main `` scenarios ''  that of superconducting fluctuations , leading to cooper pair formation above @xmath4 , or that of another order parameter fluctuations , in fact competing with superconductivity .",
    "we believe that the preferable `` scenario '' for pseudogap formation is most likely based on the model of strong scattering of the charge carriers by short  ranged antiferromagnetic ( afm , sdw ) spin fluctuations @xcite . in momentum representation",
    "this scattering transfers momenta of the order of @xmath5 ( @xmath6  lattice constant of two dimensional lattice ) .",
    "this leads to the formation of structures in the one - particle spectrum , which are precursors of the changes in the spectra due to long  range afm order ( period doubling ) .    within this",
    "fluctuation scenario a simplified model of the pseudogap state was studied @xcite under the assumption that the scattering by dynamic spin fluctuations can be reduced for high enough temperatures to a static gaussian random field ( quenched disorder ) of pseudogap fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are defined by a characteristic scattering vector from the vicinity of @xmath7 , with a width determined by the inverse correlation length of short  range order @xmath8 .",
    "actually , a similar model ( formalism ) can be applied also to the case of pseudogaps of superconducting nature @xcite .",
    "these models originated from earlier one  dimensional model of pseudogap behavior @xcite , the so called fluctuating gap model ( fgm ) , which is exactly solvable in the asymptotic limit of large correlation lengths of pseudogap fluctuations @xmath9 @xcite , and `` nearly exactly '' solvable case of finite @xmath10 , where we can take into account _ all _ feynman diagrams of perturbation series , though using an approximate _ ansatz _ for higher  order contributions @xcite .",
    "non  fermi liquid behavior of fgm model was discussed already in the case of @xmath0 @xcite , as well as in @xmath1 @xcite . however , some interesting aspects of this model are still under discussion @xcite",
    ". below we shall analyze different aspects of this anomalous behavior both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 versions , mainly for the case of afm ( sdw ) or cdw pseudgap fluctuations , and also , more brielfly for the case of superconducting fluctuations , demonstrating a kind of `` marginal '' fermi liquid behavior and qualitative picture of fermi surface `` destruction '' and formation of `` fermi arcs '' in @xmath1 , similar to that observed in arpes experiments on copper oxides .",
    "let us start with some qualitative discussion of possible manifestations of nfl behavior .",
    "green s function of interacting system of electrons is expressed via dyson equation ( in matsubara representation , @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 ) as as _ continuous _ variable . ] : @xmath13 in the following , we shall use rather _ unusual _ definition of renormalization ( `` residue '' ) @xmath2 - factor , introducing it via @xcite : @xmath14 or @xmath15 note that @xmath16 is in general complex and actually determines full renormalization of free ",
    "electron green s function @xmath17 due to interactions . at the same time",
    ", it is in some sense similar to standard residue renormalization factor used in fermi liquid theory .",
    "let us consider possible alternatives for @xmath16 behavior .      in normal fermi liquid we can perform the usual expansion ( close to fermi level and in obvious notations ) , assuming the absence of any singularities in @xmath18 : @xmath19 in the absence of static impurity scattering @xmath20 is real and just renormalizes the chemical potential .",
    "then we can rewrite ( [ dyson ] ) as : @xmath21 where we have introduced the usual renormalized residue at the pole : @xmath22 and spectrum of quasiparicles : @xmath23 the usual analytic continuation to real frequencies gives now the standard expressions of normal fermi liquid theory @xcite with real @xmath24 , conserving the quasiparticle pole of the green s function .",
    "in the special case of @xmath25 , i.e. at the fermi surface which is not renormalized by interactions ( according to landau hypothesis and luttinger theorem ) , we have : @xmath26 i.e. @xmath27 just coincides with the limit of @xmath28 as defined by ( [ z_factor ] ) , ( [ z_fac ] ) , and we have the usual pole , as @xmath29 . similarly , for @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 .    in general",
    "this behavior is conserved not only for the case of @xmath32 possessing regular expansion at small @xmath33 and @xmath34 , but also for @xmath35 with any @xmath36 .      in case of small concentration of random static impurities we have @xmath37 , with @xmath38 giving again the shift of the chemical potential , while @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is impurity scattering rate . for the green s function",
    "we have : @xmath41 so that renormalization factor defined by ( [ z_fac ] ) is given by : @xmath42 for @xmath25 we just have : @xmath43 while for @xmath44 : @xmath45 i.e. impurity scattering leads to @xmath2 - factor being zero at the fermi surface , just removing the usual fermi liquid _ pole _",
    "singularity and producing a finite _ discontinuity _ of the green s function at @xmath30 .",
    "this behavior is due to the loss of translational invariance of the fermi liquid theory ( momentum conservation ) because of impurities .",
    "in fact , green s function ( [ gimp ] ) is obtained after the _ averaging _ over impurity position , which formally restores translational invariance , leading to a kind of ( trivial ) non  fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior .",
    "note , that this behavior is observed for @xmath46 , while in the opposite limit we obviously have finite @xmath47 .",
    "consider now the case of @xmath48 - wave superconductor .",
    "normal gorkov green s function is given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is _ superconducting _ gap .",
    "the same form normal green s function takes also in excitonic or peierls insulator , where @xmath50 denotes appropriate _ insulating _ gap in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "then : @xmath51 i.e. we have nfl behavior with _ pole _ of the green s function at the fermi surface replaced by _ zero _ , due to fermi surface being `` closed '' by superconducting ( or insulating ) gap .",
    "again , fermi liquid type behavior with finite @xmath2 - factor is `` restored '' for @xmath52 .",
    "however , the complete description of superconducting ( excitonic , peierls ) phase is achieved only after the introduction also of anomalous gorkov function .",
    "excitation spectrum on both sides of the phase transition is determined by different green s functions with different topological properties @xcite .",
    "non  fermi liquid behavior of green s function due to interactions may appear also in case of singular behavior of @xmath53 for @xmath29 and @xmath54 , e.g. power  like divergence of @xmath55 with @xmath56 . obviously , in this case we have @xmath57 , and we again have _ zero _ of the green s function at the fermi surface .",
    "another possibility is singular behavior of derivatives of self - energy in ( [ sigexp ] ) , e.g. in case of @xmath58 with @xmath59 , leading to weaker than the usual pole singularity of green s function at the fermi surface .",
    "both types of behavior are realized within tomonaga  luttinger model in one ",
    "dimension @xcite , where asymptotic behavior of @xmath60 in the region of small @xmath61 can be expressed as : @xmath62 with @xmath63 . for @xmath64 : @xmath65 for @xmath66 : @xmath67 with the value of @xmath68 determined by the strength of interaction .",
    "special case is the so called `` marginal '' fermi liquid behavior _ assumed _ @xcite for interpretation of electronic properties of @xmath69 planes of copper oxides .",
    "this is given by : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is some dimensionless interaction constant , and @xmath72 is characteristic cut  off frequency .",
    "if we formally use ( [ tz ] ) at finite @xmath33 , we obtain : @xmath73 in this case `` residue at the pole '' of the green s function ( @xmath2-factor ) ) , strictly speaking , can not give correct definition of the `` residue '' , as standard expression ( [ tz ] ) is defined only at the fermi surface itself , where ( [ zmarg ] ) just does not exist .",
    "thus in what follows we prefer rather unusual definition given in ( [ z_factor ] ) . ]",
    "goes to _ zero _ at the fermi surface itself , and again quasiparticles are just not defined there at all ! however , everywhere outside a narrow ( logarithmic ) region close to the fermi surface we have more or less `` usual '' quasiparticle contribution  quasiparticles ( close to the fermi surface ) are just `` marginally '' defined . at present",
    "there are no generally accepted microscopic models of `` marginal '' fermi liquid behavior in two  dimensions .",
    "physical nature of fgm was extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is based on the picture of an electron propagating in the ( static ! ) _ gaussian _ random field of ( pseudogap ) fluctuations , leading to scattering with characteristic momentum transfer from close vicinity of some fixed scattering vector @xmath7 .",
    "these fluctuations are described by two basic parameters :  amplitude @xmath50 and correlation length ( of short  range order ) @xmath74 , determining effective width @xmath8 of scattering vector distribution .    in one  dimension ,",
    "the typical choice of scattering vector is @xmath75 ( fluctuation region of peierls transition ) @xcite , while in two  dimensions we usually mean the so called `` hot spots '' model with @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "these models assume `` dielectric '' ( cdw , sdw ) nature of pseudogap fluctuations , but essentially the same formalism can be used in case of superconducting fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the case of superconducting ( @xmath48 - wave ) pseudogap fluctuations in higher dimensions is described actually by the same one  dimensional version of fgm @xcite .",
    "attractive property of models under discussion is the possibility of an exact solution achieved by the complete summation of the whole feynman diagram series in the asymptotic limit of large correlation lengths @xmath77 @xcite . in case of finite correlation lengths",
    "we can also perform summation of _ all _ feynman diagrams for single  electron green s function , using an _ approximate _",
    "ansatz for higher order contributions both in one dimension @xcite and in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "similar methods of diagram summation can be also applied in calculations of two  particles green s functions ( vertex parts ) @xcite .",
    "our aim will be to demonstrate that nearly all aspects of nfl behavior discussed above can be nicely demonstrated within different variants of fgm .",
    "we shall limit ourselves here only to the case of incommensurate pseudogap ( cdw ) fluctuations @xcite .",
    "commensurate case @xcite can be analyzed in a similar way .",
    "note that the same expressions apply also for the case of superconducting ( @xmath48 - wave ) fluctuations in all dimensions .    in the limit of infinite correlation length of pseudogap fluctuations we have the following _ exact _ solution for a single  electron green s function @xcite : @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes integral exponential function and we used the asymptotic behavior @xmath80 for @xmath81 ( @xmath82  euler constant ) . then , using ( [ z_fac ] ) we immediately obtain : @xmath83 precisely the same result is obtained if we define for finite @xmath84 : @xmath85 similar to ( [ tz ] ) .",
    "note that due to @xmath86 ,  @xmath87 we obviously have @xmath88 , but the usual _ pole _ of the green s function at the fermi surface ( `` point '' ) of the `` normal '' system is transformed here to _",
    "zero _ due to pseudogap fluctuations .",
    "because of topological stability @xcite , the singularity of the green s function at the fermi surface is not destroyed : _ zero is also a singularity _ ( with the same topological charge ) as pole .",
