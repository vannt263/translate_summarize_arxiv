    "we develop a bundle technique to solve nonconvex variational problems arising in contact mechanics and in other applied fields .",
    "we are specifically interested in the delamination of composite structures with an adhesive bonding under destructive loading , a failure mode which is studied in the material sciences .",
    "when the properties of the interlayer adhesive between the bonded bodies are given in the form of a physical law relating the normal component of the stress vector to the relative displacement between the upper and lower boundaries at the crack tip , the challenge is to compute the displacement and stress fields in order to assess the reactive destructive forces along the contact boundary , as the latter are difficult to measure in situ .",
    "this leads to minimization of an energy functional , where a specific form of nonsmoothness arises in the boundary integral at the contact boundary .",
    "after discretization via piecewise linear finite elements using the trapezoidal quadrature rule , this leads to a finite - dimensional nonsmooth optimization problem of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is locally lipschitz and neither smooth nor convex . depending on the nature of the frictional forces , the criterion",
    "@xmath3 may be upper-@xmath0 or lower-@xmath0 , see e.g. figure [ dellaw ] .",
    "as these two classes of nonsmooth functions behave substantially differently when minimized , we are forced to expand on existing bundle strategies and develop an algorithm general enough to encompass both types of nonsmoothness .",
    "we prove its convergence to a critical point in the sense of subsequences , and show that it provides satisfactory numerical results in a simulation of the double cantilever beam test @xcite , one of the most popular destructive tests to qualify structural adhesive joints .",
    "the difficulty in nonconvex bundling is to provide a suitable cutting plane oracle which replaces the no longer available convex tangent plane .",
    "one of the oldest oracles , discussed already in mifflin @xcite , and used in the bundle codes of lemarchal and sagastizbal @xcite , or the bt - codes of zowe @xcite , uses the method of _ downshifted tangents_. while these authors use linesearch with armijo and wolfe type conditions , which allows only weak convergence certificates in the sense that _ some _ accumulation point of the sequence of serious iterates is critical , we favor proximity control in tandem with a suitable backtracking strategy .",
    "this leads to stronger convergence certificates , where _ every _ accumulation point of the sequence of serious iterates is critical .",
    "for instance , in @xcite a strong certificate for downshifted tangents with proximity control was proved within the class of lower-@xmath0 functions , but its validity for upper-@xmath0 criteria remained open .",
    "an oracle for upper-@xmath0 functions with a rigorous convergence theory can be based on the _ model approach _ of @xcite , but the latter is not compatible with the downshift oracle .",
    "to have two strings to one bow is unsatisfactory , as one could hardly expect practitioners to select their strategy according to such a distinction , which might not be easy to make in practice . in this work",
    "we will resolve this impasse and present a cutting plane oracle based on downshifted tangents , which leads to a bundle method with strong convergence certificate for both types of nonsmoothness . in its principal components",
    "our method agrees with existing strategies for downshifted tangents , like @xcite , and could therefore be considered as a justification of this technique for a wide class of applications .",
    "differences with existing methods occur in the management of the proximity control parameter , which in our approach has to respect certain rules to assure convergence to a critical point , without impeding good practical performance .",

    "mathematical analysis and numerical results for quasistatic delamination problems can be found in @xcite .",

    ", we expect lower- and upper-@xmath0 functions to behave completely differently . minimizing a lower-@xmath0 function ought to lead to real difficulties , as on descending we move _ into _ the zone of nonsmoothness , which for lower-@xmath0 goes downward .",
    "in contrast , upper-@xmath0 functions are generally expected to be well - behaved , as intuitively on descending we move _ away _ from the nonsmoothness , which here goes upward .",
    "the present application shows that this argument is too simplistic .",
    "minimization of upper-@xmath0 functions leads to real difficulties , which we explain subsequently . in delamination for composite materials we encounter objective functions of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 gathers the smooth part , while the integral term , due to the minimum , is responsible for the nonsmoothness .",
