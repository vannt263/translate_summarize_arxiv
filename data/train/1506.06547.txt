    "in recent years a great attention has been devoted to the study of thermal transport at the nanoscale and energy and heat exchanges in small quantum devices  @xcite .",

    "this emerging field goes under the name of caloritronics @xcite . here",
    ", surprising experimental results have been already obtained . among them",
    "have recently demonstrated the possibility to coherently manipulate the heat flux in a hybrid superconducting circuit @xcite . by realizing the thermal version of the electric josephson interferometer",
    ", they have paved the way towards the phase - coherent manipulation of heat in mesoscopic devices @xcite .",
    "moreover , implementations of mesoscopic heat engines and thermal diodes have been proposed and will be soon achieved @xcite .",
    "these can be realized using quantum dots @xcite , optomechanical systems @xcite , and multiterminal mesoscopic devices combining also normal metals , superconductors and ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "the rapid progresses made in the field of caloritronics allow to glimpse a future in which electric and thermal manipulation will proceed on equal footing .",
    "+ in this context a promising role is played by topologically protected states , such as the edge states of quantum hall systems ( qhs ) and topological insulators ( ti ) . as far as the recently discovered tis are concerned , the presence of protected helical edge states not only allows to generate peculiar spin - dependent thermal phenomena @xcite , but also to achieve high thermoelectric performances @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the interest of the scientific community for qhs has been refueled in the view of possible thermal applications@xcite .",
    "for example , sanchez _ et al .",
    "_ have demonstrated that a three terminal device in the quantum hall regime can work as a perfect thermal diode , with a rectification coefficient @xmath0 , exploiting the chirality of edge states @xcite .",
    "heat transport measurements were also proposed in order to extract important information on fractional statistics and neutral modes in exotic fractional quantum hall states@xcite . in these",
    "topologically states protection from backscattering guarantees phase - coherent ballistic transport of charge and heat over long ( @xmath1 @xmath2 m ) distances @xcite , and the possibility to control their charge transport properties in the presence of applied bias voltages via interferometric setups have been extensively studied .",
    "however , the effects of quantum interference on their thermal and thermoelectric properties remain quite unexplored , and our work , motivated indeed by the recent interest in phase - coherent heat manipulation , moves in this direction .    in this paper",
    "we show that the chiral edge states of qhs can be exploited to implement coherent caloritronics . in particular ,",
    "we consider two separated qhs coupled by a tunneling region , driven out of equilibrium by the presence of a thermal gradient that induces finite charge and heat flows .",
    "we demonstrate that a tunnel junction with @xmath3 quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) enables to control the charge and heat transfer between the two qhs .",
    "as far as the charge sector is concerned , we show that , by varying the geometrical parameters of the junction , particle - hole symmetry can be broken , allowing to selectively enhance electron tunneling with respect to hole tunneling or viceversa .",
    "therefore we predict the interesting result that quantum interference can be exploited to selectively switch the charge flow induced by the thermal gradient , that is , charge current can either flows from hot to cold or from cold to hot , depending on the interference properties .",
    "+ remarkably , we find that quantum interference phenomena control heat transport as well .",
    "contrary to the charge transport , with electrons and holes giving opposite contributions , heat transport does not depend on the charge of the carriers , so that electrons and holes equally contribute ; this property manifests in the correspondence between the zeros of the charge current and the maximum / minimum visibility of the heat current .",
    "furthermore , we study how these quantum interference phenomena , already present in the absence of interactions ( tunneling between integer qhs ) , are affected by the presence of interactions , by considering tunneling of electrons between fractional and integer qhs , where e - e interactions play an important role . as a general remark , a strong suppression of the signal appears , due to the anomalous temperature dependence of the effective tunneling density of states , a hallmark of non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "more interestingly , the presence of different filling factors breaks the left - right symmetry , inducing rectification effects . by taking advantage from the interference patterns induced in the presence of several qpcs",
    ", we show that strong rectification effects can be obtained .",
    "we thus demonstrate that the interplay between interactions and quantum interference is crucial in order to enhance the heat rectification .",

    "<S> interference represents one of the most striking manifestation of quantum physics in low - dimensional systems . despite evidences of quantum interference in charge transport </S>",
    "<S> have been known for a long time , only recently signatures of interference induced thermal properties have been reported , paving the way for the phase - coherent manipulation of heat in mesoscopic devices . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that anomalous thermoelectric properties and efficient heat rectification can be achieved by exploiting the phase - coherent edge states of quantum hall systems . by considering a tunneling geometry with multiple quantum point contacts , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the interference paths effectively break the electron - hole symmetry , allowing for a thermoelectric charge current flowing either from hot to cold or viceversa , depending on the details of the tunnel junction . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , an interference induced heat current is predicted , and we are able to explain these results in terms of an intuitive physical picture . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that heat rectification can be achieved by coupling two quantum hall systems with different filling factors , and that this effect can be enhanced by exploiting the interference properties of the tunnel junction . </S>"
