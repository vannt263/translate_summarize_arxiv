    "the dwarf nova wz sge is arguably the most extreme cataclysmic variable ( cv ) known .",
    "whereas other dwarf novae undergo 3 - 5 magnitude eruptions every few weeks or months , wz sge s outbursts have an amplitude of 7 - 8 magnitudes and recur on a time - scale of roughly 33 years .",
    "wz sge s 82 minute orbital period is also one of the shortest of any cv , its mass ratio is one of the lowest ( @xmath3 ; steeghs et al . 2001 ) and its time - averaged absolute magnitude one of the faintest ( @xmath4 ; patterson 1998 ) .",
    "all of these facts suggest that wz sge is a highly evolved cv whose secondary is probably a brown dwarf - like object ( patterson 1998 ) .",
    "many studies of wz  sge in quiescence have found oscillations near 28  s ( robinson , nather & patterson 1978 ; patterson 1980 ; skidmore et al . 1997 ; welsh et al .",
    "1997 ; patterson et al .",
    "1998 [ p98 ] ; skidmore et al .",
    "1999 [ s99 ] ) . however , the origin of these oscillations is still unclear : robinson et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and s99 favour a zz ceti - like , pulsating white dwarf ( wd ) model , but patterson ( 1980 ) and p98 prefer an oblique magnetic rotator model .",
    "a modified version of the latter model has recently been proposed by warner & woudt ( 2002 [ w02 ] ; also see section  [ discuss ] ) .    here , we report the discovery of 15-s oscillations in hst observations of wz  sge obtained roughly 1 month after the start of its 2001 outburst .",
    "this is the earliest detection of rapid oscillations following an outburst of the system ( patterson et al .",
    "wz  sge went into outburst on july 23 , 2001 ( ishioka et al .",
    "the ensuing multi - wavelength campaign included two _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) _",
    "director s discretionary time _ ( ddt ) programs .",
    "the hst observations analysed here were obtained with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) during the first ddt program .",
    "the goal of this program was to cover the immediate aftermath of the outburst in the fuv , with three observing epochs on aug 8 , aug 19 and aug 22 .",
    "each epoch consisted of 4 consecutive hst orbits .",
    "the bulk of the observing time in each epoch was used to obtain time - resolved , high - resolution , fuv spectroscopy of wz  sge with the e140 m echelle grating dispersing the light onto the fuv - mama detectors operating in time - tag mode .",
    "this set - up covers the region 1150      1700    at a spectral resolution of 45,800 . due to overheads ,",
    "fuv exposure times in the first and third orbit of each epoch are shorter than those in the second and fourth orbits .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the timing of the hst observations relative to the optical outburst light curve . following the nomenclature of patterson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we see that the first of our hst observations occurred during the plateau phase of the outburst , the second during the ensuing dip and the third near the peak of the first echo outburst .",
    "since our focus here is on the search for rapid oscillations , we constructed `` white light '' light curves at 1-s time resolution directly from the time - tag files .",
    "these files contain a list of the arrival times and detector positions of all recorded photon events .",
    "the backgrounds due to dark current and geocoronal emission are negligible in our data , so the resulting light curves are ideally suited for studying the short - timescale variability of wz  sge .",
    "the raw fuv light curves immediately revealed the presence of strong , rapid oscillations in epoch  3 , though not in epochs  1 and 2 .",
    "the epoch  3 light curves are shown in figure  2 . a roughly 5% oscillation with period near 15",
    "s is easily visible .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is clearly variable ( e.g. note the weakness of the oscillations around @xmath5  s and @xmath6  s ) .",
    "however , there is no obvious link between oscillation amplitude and orbital phase @xmath7 ( computed from the ephemeris of p98 ; inferior conjunction of the secondary corresponds to @xmath8 [ steeghs et al .",
    "2001 ] ) .",
    "figure  3 shows the discrete fourier transform of each hst orbit within epoch  3 .",
    "as expected , signals near 15  s are easily seen in all data subsets .",
    "no obvious signals are seen at frequencies corresponding to periods around 30  s. in particular , there is no convincing evidence for the 27.87-s signal that is the most stable clock in quiescence ( p98 ) , nor for any `` subharmonics '' of the dominant 15-s signals .",
    "figure  3 also reveals that the oscillation period is variable .",
    "most noticably , the dominant period in orbit  1 is @xmath9  s , but this has changed to @xmath10  s in orbit  2 .",
    "signals with periods of about 6.5  s are also present in orbits 1 and 3 . if these are harmonics of signals near the dominant 15-s periods , then at least in the case of the 6.43-s signal in orbit  1 , the harmonic has to dominate strongly over the fundamental .",
    "the 6.5-s oscillations appear to be strongest when the 15-s oscillations are weakest .",
    "thus in the raw light curves ( figure  2 ) , the 6.5-s oscillations are only discernible when the main signal is weak , e.g. near @xmath11  s and @xmath12  s.    in order to analyse the time evolution of the 15-s oscillations more carefully , we carried out sliding sinusoid fits to successive chunks of the epoch  3 light curve",
    ". the model was a constant period sinusoid superposed on a constant dc offset , @xmath13 . in practice ,",
    "@xmath14 was always fixed to the dominant frequency in each orbit ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "the fits were carried out to successive 45-s chunks of data , with no overlap .",
    "the phase of the first chunk in each orbit was arbitrarily set to 180@xmath15 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  4 .",
    "there appears to be no connection between the amplitude of the oscillations and the average flux ( the dc offset ) .",
    "the median oscillation amplitude is 530  c / s ; the median ratio of the amplitude to the dc offset is 5.0% .",
    "the obvious phase variability in figure  3 confirms that the oscillation period is variable .",
    "more specifically , given the form of our model , a linear phase shift implies that the true period differs from the trial period .",
    "any non - linearity in the phase plots is a sign that the oscillation period is changing .",
    "for example , a transition from one linear portion to another indicates a switch from one period to another .",
    "the phase plots in figure  4 clearly show such transitions , usually on time - scales shorter than we can resolve .",
    "we emphasise , however , that our fits assume a _ single _ , sinusoidal signal . if _",
    "several _ signals are present simultaneously , the results of such a fit will depend on the relative amplitudes of the signals and the closeness of their periods to that assumed in the fit .",
    "we begin our discussion by summarising the key properties of the 15-s oscillations we have discovered :    1 .",
    "they were found in data obtained 1  month after the start of wz  sge s 2001 outburst , just past the peak of the first echo outburst ; 2 .",
    "they are strong , with fractional amplitudes around 5% ; 3 .",
    "their periods are about a factor of two shorter than those of the 28-s oscillations seen in quiescence ; the latter are not seen in our data ; 4 .",
    "they exhibit phase jitter consistent with small , possibly discontinuous period changes .",
    "these properties are unusual .",
    "oscillations in wz  sge have previously only been seen in data obtained in quiescence .",
    "their periods are typically 28  s  29  s ( s99 ) , with the most stable signal lying at 28.87  s ( p98 ) .",
    "oscillations near 15  s have only been seen once before ( provencal & nather 1995 ) , but never as the dominant signal .",
    "finally , no oscillation with @xmath16  s has ever been reported in wz  sge ..    it is interesting that the dominant periods in our data are roughly half of those seen in quiescence .",
    "however , only the period determined for orbit  1 could be harmonically related with the 27.87  s signal ( @xmath17  s  @xmath18  s ) . among other periods",
    "reported in the literature ( see table  2 in s99 ) , the closest harmonic matches to the periods in our data are : 29.33  s ( orbit 2 : @xmath19  s  @xmath20  s ) ; 29.10  s ( orbit 3 : @xmath21  s  @xmath22",
    "s ) ; 29.69  s ( orbit 4 : @xmath23  s  @xmath24  s ) .",
    "however , @xmath25  10 apparently distinct periods around 28  s/29  s have been reported , so the statistical significance of these near matches is unclear .",
    "figure  3 certainly reveals no evidence of any @xmath26 29-s fundamental periods in our data .",
    "moreover , if the peaks in figure  3 near 6.5  s are also interpreted as harmonics , the corresponding fundamentals ( orbit 1 : @xmath27  s  @xmath28  s ; orbit 3 : @xmath29  s  @xmath30  s ) have no counterparts among previously reported periods .",
    "it seems unlikely that the oscillations in our data can be due to zz  ceti - like wd pulsations .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the mean fuv spectrum obtained during epoch  2 ( only 3 days before epoch  3 ) , suggests @xmath31  k ( kuulkers et al . 2001 ;",
    "long 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "this is well beyond the blue edge of the zz  ceti instability strip at @xmath32  k ( for @xmath33 ; bradley & winget 1994 ) .",
    "however , we can not rule out the pulsation model definitively , because the response of a pulsating wd to the heating and compression it experiences during a dwarf nova outburst is unknown .",
    "in order to examine the magnetic rotator model , we need some constraints on the accretion rate through the disk in outburst , relative to the quiescent value .",
    "patterson et al . ( 2002 ) find that the mass transfer rate _ from the secondary _ in quiescence is @xmath34  g / s .",
    "the quiescent rate must therefore satisfy @xmath35  g / s , and we will adopt @xmath36  g / s as a conservative upper limit .",
    "the quiescent x - ray luminosity of wz  sge is @xmath37  ergs / s ( eracleous , halpern & patterson 1991 ; mukai & shiokawa 1993 ) .",
    "since the x - rays probably arise in the boundary layer , they can represent at most half of the total quiescent accretion power , i.e. @xmath38 . using the nauenberg ( 1972 ) approximation to the hamada - salpeter ( 1961 ) wd mass - radius , this yields a lower limit @xmath39  g / s .",
    "by contrast , a preliminary disk model fit to the time - averaged fuv spectrum obtained in our epoch  3 suggests @xmath40  g / s ( k.s .",
    "long 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "thus the accretion rate in epoch  3 exceeded the quiescent rate by a factor in the range 150  15,000 .",
    "this immediately rules out a standard intermediate polar ( ip ) model for the oscillations .",
    "this is because for a wd satisfying @xmath41 ( steeghs et al .",
    "2001 ) , the 27.87-s oscillations correspond to keplerian periods at @xmath42 .",
    "this presumably marks the inner edge of the quiescent disk in the ip model .",
    "however , the magnetospheric radius of an accreting magnetic wd scales as @xmath43 ( dipole ) and @xmath44 ( quadrupole ) ( e.g. w02 ) . with @xmath45 , the magnetosphere",
    "should thus have been completely crushed onto the wd surface during epoch  3 .",
    "w02 have recently proposed an alternative magnetic rotator model .",
    "they envisage the magnetic field being anchored in an equatorial accretion belt surrounding the wd .",
    "this belt has a relatively low moment of inertia , so its angular velocity can respond quickly to changes in @xmath46 .",
    "their model predicts a much weaker dependence of @xmath47  on @xmath46 , because the belt s magnetic field scales as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the angular velocity and @xmath50 the mass of the belt ( w02 ) .",
    "according to w02 , the resulting dependence of oscillation period @xmath51 on @xmath46 can be as weak as @xmath52 during an outburst .",
    "thus the outburst / quiescence period ratio of about 0.5 corresponds to a ratio of accretion rates of roughly 1000 in their model .",
    "this is within the allowed range .",
    "w02 account differently for what they call `` period discontinuities '' , i.e. relatively small period changes on short time - scales .",
    "they propose that the accretion belt is rotating differentially , with @xmath49  decreasing away from the equator .",
    "the instantaneous oscillation period is then determined by which part of the belt is currently being `` fed '' .",
    "period discontinuities occur as magnetic reconnection events switch the feeding from one belt region to another .",
    "the upshot is that only longer - term period changes reflect changes in @xmath46 . in wz",
    "sge , the change in period between quiescence and outburst would then probably reflect a change in @xmath46 , but the smaller changes within epoch  3 would be caused by magnetic reconnection events on the differentially rotating accretion belt .",
    "the ability of the w02 model to account for both the long - term and short - term period changes is encouraging .",
    "however , the model owes its success at least partly to the sheer complexity of the mechanism(s ) it uses to explain different observational features .",
    "also , we have not even attempted to explain the 6.5-s signals in some of our data , nor the weakness / absence of the oscillations during epochs  1 and 2 .",
    "we therefore feel that the origin of the wz  sge s oscillations remains an open question .",
    "we finally note that the oscillations can be used to set a lower limit on the wd mass , under the assumption that their periods they can be identified with the periods of revolution of material rotating about the white dwarf .",
    "the shortest possible keplerian period around a wd of mass @xmath53 and radius @xmath54 is @xmath55 again using the nauenberg ( 1972 ) mass - radius relation for cold wds , we find a lower limit of @xmath1 for our shortest dominant period of 13.93  s and @xmath2 for the weaker 6.43-s signal seen in orbit 1 .",
    "both limits are consistent with the constraint @xmath56 imposed by the spectroscopic mass function ( steeghs et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
