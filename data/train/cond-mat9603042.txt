    "notwithstanding its long history the study of itinerant ferromagnetism is known as one of the most difficult theoretical problems . at the early stage",
    "the problem of ferromagnetism was studied within the mean field approximation to the coulomb interaction . however , in 1960 s kanamori,@xcite gutzwiller@xcite and hubbard@xcite independently studied the effect of electron correlations on metallic ferromagnetism , which is left out in the mean field approximation . according to them correlation effects are so important that itinerant ferromagnetism is possible only in restricted situations : a large density of states at the fermi energy is not sufficient to realize ferromagnetism .",
    "nagaoka@xcite and thouless@xcite pointed out a different aspect of ferromagnetism .",
    "studying the motion of a hole ( and a few holes ) in strongly correlated electrons , nagaoka and other researchers noticed that the possibility of ferromagnetism is a delicate issue depending on the lattice structure and the density of electrons.@xcite    quite recently several exact results have been found for ferromagnetism in hubbard and related models;@xcite however those results are restricted to a special density of electrons . in this connection",
    "we note in particular that tasaki has taken up the problem of ferromagnetism in a series of interesting papers@xcite , and has studied several new models , in which the relevant band is flat or almost flat . for such models he succeeded in proving rigorously that the ground state is ferromagnetic when the electron density takes a particular value , namely 1/2 ( quarter - filling ) , in which case the system is insulating .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to reexamine the same problem from a slightly different viewpoint .",
    "our approach can provide a new way to look at the problem of ferromagnetism and can thereby examine the stability of ferromagnetism , at least in some cases , without any restriction to the electron density .    restricting ourselves for a while to one - dimensional systems",
    ", we will consider a model which interpolates between systems with large density of states and nagaoka  like ferromagnetism , and we focus our attention on the following hamiltonian : @xmath0    + \\varepsilon_0\\sum_j n_{j+{1 \\over 2}\\sigma } \\nonumber \\\\ & &   + u \\sum_j n_{j\\uparrow}n_{j\\downarrow }   + u ' \\sum_j n_{j+{1 \\over 2}\\uparrow}n_{j+{1 \\over 2}\\downarrow } , \\label{eqn:(1)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is assumed to be positive , while @xmath2 and @xmath3 are more or less arbitrary and restrictions will be made when needed .",
    "index @xmath4 takes integer values , and sites with integer index we call ` c ' sites , while those with half  odd integer index ` d ' sites .",
    "we consider cases where the number of electrons @xmath5 is equal or less than the number of ` c ' sites ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the total number of sites ) .",
    "the ferromagnetic state has total spin @xmath9 .",
    "this two band model , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , has more degrees of freedom than the regular hubbard model and it should be able to exhibit more phases . some special cases has already been studied in literature . for @xmath10 and @xmath11 the dispersion of one of the bands becomes flat , and the ferromagnetism in the so called flat band models has been discussed in the works of mielke@xcite and tasaki.@xcite moreover , for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 the model is equivalent to what mller - hartmann studied in the low density limit.@xcite finally , for @xmath12 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 it was discussed by long and coworkers.@xcite    let us also point out that by applying a particle  hole transformation to this model we get a hamiltonian where the hopping amplitudes change sign , @xmath2 becomes @xmath17 , the coulomb interactions are unchanged , and the density transforms as @xmath18 .",
    "there are several reasons to believe that the ferromagnetic ground state should be stable in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:(1 ) ] ) for a relatively wide range of parameters .",
    "first , the basic building block is a triangle with two ` c ' sites and one ` d ' sites , and the triangles are connected to form a chain ( one dimensional model ) , or to form some kind of two ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model2d ] ) or three dimensional lattice . taking this triangle and putting two electrons on it , the triplet ground state is favored over the singlet for a relatively large region of the hopping @xmath19 , @xmath2 and interaction @xmath20 .",
    "especially , if @xmath21 , then the high spin state is realized for any finite value of @xmath20 .",
    "second , as we already mentioned , for @xmath22 the lower band is flat , and it has been proved that the model is ferromagnetic for any @xmath23 at quarter filling ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "a nearly flat band also means large density of states near the fermi level .",
    "third , anticipating the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : effham ] , we mention that for @xmath25 and large @xmath2 the usual second order process giving rise to effective antiferromagnetic coupling between spins on neighboring sites in the case of the regular hubbard model is suppressed . instead we have a third order process with an effective exchange @xmath26 , where the sign can be adjusted by the hopping @xmath1 and it is ferromagnetic for @xmath27 .",
    "this is also valid away from quarter filling .",
    "the mechanism described is clearly of kinetic origin and resembles nagaoka  effect .",
    "these arguments raise the following questions on the model in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:(1 ) ] ) :    \\1 ) does the high spin ground state survives if we put many triangles together ?",
    "in other words , how robust is the tasaki ferromagnetism against a perturbation which destroys the flatness of the band ? and to what extent is the strong coupling perturbational argument valid ?",
    "\\2 ) are there any cases in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:(1 ) ] ) , where _ metallic _ ferromagnetism is realized ?",
    "to motivate the reader s curiosity , let us start by showing in fig .",
    "[ fig : sche ] the phase diagram we got in the insulating , quarter - filled case .",
    "we see that ferromagnetism with a correct excitation spectrum turns out to be a robust feature of this model and is realized in a fairly large parameter region .",
    "it is not surprising if we recall that in some loose sense our model interpolates between the nagaoka like ferromagnetism of kinetic origin in the large - u limit and flat band ferromagnetism with large density of states at the fermi level , and that they both favor the fully polarized , ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "this is very encouraging since it shows that ferromagnetism can show up for cases that are more realistic than the flat band model or nagaoka effect .",
    "we emphasize that near flat band models are multi  band systems , with the important consequence that the interaction becomes momentum dependent ( and is not constant as in the one  band hubbard models ) and this effective long range interaction is essential to stabilize the ferromagnetic state for small values of @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore the role of the triangles is not restricted to generate effective ferromagnetic exchange , but also prevents ferrimagnetism @xcite ( not being a bipartite lattice ) and its importance has been already recognized by takahashi@xcite and shastry _ et al._@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for the itinerant case the situation is not so clear .",
    "although the phase diagram is similar to that of the insulating case , the boundary effects due to low dimensionality of the model are enhanced and make the analysis difficult .    finally , let us remark that although we studied the one  dimensional model in details , we believe that similar conclusions would hold for higher dimensional models as well .    to reach the above conclusions we analyzed the model in eq .",
