    "[ os2]c  f the winding number around a crossroll fixed point increases from @xmath195 = 1 to @xmath195 = 4 and the period @xmath196 of the oscillations increases from @xmath197 to @xmath198 in integer steps .",
    "this increase of the winding number in the sc continues beyond @xmath199 ; we have found also @xmath200 .",
    "however , the control parameter interval @xmath201 for an @xmath195-cycle becomes so narrow ",

    "the transition between the oscillations and the crossroll state is slightly hysteretic . upon reducing @xmath110",
    "the system remains in the crossroll state until below the sc interval and then a transition to an @xmath204 oscillation occurs .",
    "so in a small @xmath110-interval there is bistable coexistence of oscillations and stationary crossrolls .",
    "we reviewed our findings of rayleigh  bnard convection in binary mixtures with positive soret effect . in this case",
    "the lighter component of the mixture is driven into the direction of higher temperature .",
    "the enhanced density gradient leads to a convective instability at smaller temperature differences than in the pure fluid case .",
    "convection at positive @xmath29 shows a rich variety of stable structures at moderate @xmath205 .    using the galerkin technique , we investigated two- and three - dimensional laterally periodic patterns as rolls , squares , and stationary and oscillatory crossrolls and determined their stability behavior .",
    "all these patterns are realized as stable convection structures somewhere in parameter space .",
    "the numerical examination of convection in liquid binary mixtures is in general much more difficult compared to pure fluids since small values of the lewis number @xmath206 lead to a pronounced narrow boundary layer behavior of the concentration field .",
    "this is especially the case for rolls whereas squares are somewhat smoother .",
    "nevertheless we had to restrict the stability analysis of the three - dimensional structures to perturbations with the same wave number .",
    "squares and rolls coexist as convective solutions above onset .",
    "the square symmetry requires that the main velocity modes are equal : @xmath207 .",
    "for the two - dimensional rolls on the other hand one of these amplitudes , say @xmath208 is zero .",
    "squares are stable in the soret region if @xmath24 is sufficiently small .",
    "they transfer their stability to crossrolls at higher @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath24 is not too small , only stationary crossrolls exist . as squares",
    ", they can be described as linear superpositions of roll structures . for them",
    "however , @xmath209 or vice versa . with increasing @xmath110",
    "the smaller amplitude tends to zero until the crossroll branch ends on the now stable roll branch in the bifurcation diagram .    at very small @xmath24",
    "there exists also a branch of oscillatory crossrolls that emerges out of the square branch in a supercritical hopf bifurcation at smaller @xmath110 than the branch of the stationary type . in the oscillatory",
    "crossrolls @xmath189 and @xmath190 oscillate in opposite phase around a common mean value given by the unstable square state . at higher @xmath110",
    "the oscillatory crossrolls disappear in a subharmonic bifurcation cascade and the stationary ones gain stability .    at higher @xmath24 roll structures",
    "are stable directly above onset and crossrolls structures do not appear .",
    "the analysis of the rolls shows that in the explored parameter range only the basic mechanisms of instability occur that are already known from the pure fluid , namely the eckhaus , zigzag , crossroll , oscillatory , and skewed varicose mechanism .",
    "when the soret region is small , the stability balloon of the mixtures resembles the busse balloon for the pure fluid .",
    "however , at small @xmath24 when the soret region is large the situation is different .",
    "the fixed point solutions show a sharp transition between the two regimes .",
    "the convection amplitudes are very small in the soret regime .",
    "but near @xmath210 they increase strongly and become comparable to those of the pure fluid convection .",
    "the stability boundaries of roll convection show a similar transition here . in the rayleigh region",
    "the boundaries are close to the boundaries of the pure fluid . but upon reducing the rayleigh number the boundaries begin to deviate from their pure fluid counterparts . near onset",
    "they finally agree with the predictions of the amplitude equations for the mixtures .",
