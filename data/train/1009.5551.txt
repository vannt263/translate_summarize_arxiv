    "study of light scalar resonances is one of the central problems of non - perturbative qcd , it is important for understanding both the confinement physics and the chiral symmetry realization way in the low energy region",
    ". the commonly suggested nonet of light scalar mesons is @xmath8 ( or @xmath4 ) , @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) , @xmath5 and @xmath11 ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the 1987",
    "it was suggested in @xcite to investigate light scalar mesons in radiative @xmath12 decays .",
    "chiral one - loop mechanism of the transition @xmath13 ( kaon loop model ) was also proposed there .",
    "ten years later , in the 1998 , the decays @xmath14 and @xmath2 were experimentally discovered in budker inp @xcite . then in the 2002 kloe group",
    "published the high - statistical data on these decays @xcite ( 800 @xmath14 events and 2400 @xmath2 events ) .",
    "in @xcite the kloe data on the @xmath2 decay were described simultaneously with the data on the @xmath0 scattering and the @xmath3 reaction .",
    "the description was carried out taking into account the chiral shielding @xcite of @xmath4 and the @xmath15 mixing .",
    "the data did nt contradict the existence of the @xmath4 meson and yielded evidence in favor of the four - quark nature of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons .",
    "these experiments ratified kaon loop mechanism .",
    "this description revealed new goals .",
    "the point is that at the same time it was calculated in @xcite the @xmath0 scattering amplitude in the @xmath1 complex plane , basing on chiral expansion , dispersion relations and roy equations , see figs .",
    "[ fig1],[fig2 ] .",
    "in particular , the pole in @xmath16 was obtained in @xcite , where    @xmath17    and was assigned to the @xmath18 resonance .",
    "aiming the comparison of the results of @xcite and @xcite it is necessary to build the @xmath0 scattering amplitude with correct analytical properties in the complex @xmath1 plane .",
    "the point is that in @xcite s - matrix of the @xmath0 scattering is the product of the `` resonance '' and `` background '' parts :    @xmath19    and the @xmath20 had desired analytical properties , while analytical properties of the @xmath21 in the whole complex @xmath1 plane were not essential for the aims of @xcite , where mainly physical region was investigated , and adler zero existence together with poles absence on the real axis of the @xmath1 complex plane were demanded .    in this paper",
    "we present the @xmath0 scattering amplitude with desired analytical properties and the data description obtained with this amplitude .",
    "the comparison with @xcite results is presented also .     of the @xmath0 scattering @xcite and the experimental data @xcite ]     of the @xmath0 scattering ( @xmath1 in units of @xmath22 ) @xcite ]",
    "the s - wave amplitude @xmath23 of the @xmath0 scattering with i=0 @xcite is    @xmath24    here @xmath25 is the inelasticity , @xmath26 is the scattering phase , @xmath27 is the phase of the elastic background , and    @xmath28    the desired analytical properties of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude are : two cuts in the @xmath1-complex plane , adler zero , absence of poles on the physical sheet of the riemannian surface , resonance poles on the second sheet of the riemannian surface .",
    "this applies curtain restrictions on the @xmath27 .",
    "the inverse propagator of scalar @xmath29 @xcite    @xmath30    where    @xmath31\\int_{(m_a+m_b)^2}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\bar{m}\\gamma(r\\to ab,\\bar{m})\\ , d\\bar{m}^2}{[\\bar{m}^2-(m_a+m_b)^2](\\bar{m}^2-m^2-i\\varepsilon)}\\ ] ]    so , following @xcite , we have    @xmath32    and , since expression in brackets is positive , im@xmath33 may be equal to zero only when @xmath34im  @xmath35 .",
    "let s use the same mechanism and take @xmath36 in the form    @xmath37    where    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40 +",
    "since im@xmath41 we require that @xmath42 should be positive and have no singularities on the physical sheet .",
    "this is provided if we take    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    with the help of the above formulas we obtain the results , shown in figs [ fig3],[fig4],[fig5 ] .",
    "one can see that the experimental data and the corridor from @xcite are described well .     of the @xmath0 scattering .",
    "solid line is our description , dashed lines mark borders of the corridor @xcite , points are experimental data , width=110,height=66 ]     of the @xmath0 scattering ( @xmath1 in units of @xmath22 ) .",

    "the @xmath18 pole is not at ( [ polesigma ] ) but at @xmath53    this deviation is not a crime , because roy equations are approximate , they are one - channel ( @xmath0).[multiblock footnote omitted ]    also @xmath54 , while @xmath55 .",
    "we find out that the role of high channels is very important for pole positions . for r=@xmath56",
    "we take @xmath57    but a fit without @xmath58 coupling to @xmath59 , and @xmath60 and small @xmath18 coupling to these channels gives us    @xmath61 ( instead of @xmath62 ) ,    @xmath63 ( instead of @xmath64 ) .",
    "+ note that if we additionally neglect @xmath18 coupling to the @xmath65 in the obtained results , the pole is transferred to @xmath66 .",
    "we plan to use results of this work for study of other reactions , including decays of heavy quarkoniums and pion polarization .",
    "special words should be said about refinement of the obtained results .",
    "new precise measurement of the inelasticity @xmath67 near @xmath65 threshold would be crucial , it can improve our knowledge about light scalar mesons a lot .",
    "in fact , commonly used data on @xmath67 were obtained forty years ago , and they are not enough .",
    "as far as we know , some collaborations even have raw data ( for example , ves collaboration ) , and all they have to do is to process these data .    new precise data on the @xmath2 decay would also clarify the situation .",
    "the kloe collaboration has measured this reaction with excellent precision , and hopefully they will publish final results .",
    "1 .   the @xmath0 scattering amplitude with correct analytical properties has been built .",
    "2 .   this amplitude describes experimental data and the results based on roy equations on the real @xmath1 axis .",
    "3 .   a contradiction in position of @xmath18 pole may be an indication of the important role of high channels in the @xmath0 scattering amplitude and its analytical continuation even for @xmath68 much less than @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath58 pole is situated far from the position , predicted by breit - wigner approximation .",
    "new experiments are important for the study of light scalar mesons .",
    "we are grateful to h. leutwyler for useful intensive communications , in particular for tables with @xmath0 scattering amplitude on the real @xmath1 axis , obtained in @xcite .",
