    "in order to understand the superconductivity mechanism for high-@xmath0 superconductors ( htsc ) , many experiments have attempted to find out possibles correlations between the superconductivity temperatures @xmath0 and some physical parameter .",
    "some of this experiments deal with the interplay among @xmath0 , hole contents and pressure effects which have revealed interesting features like the maximum attained @xmath0@xcite and have attracted a lot of attention as it is summarized by some review articles@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "neither one of the several microscopic theoretical models have been able to deal successfully with all these observed basic properties and therefore the nature of the condensate pair has not yet been established . as a consequence ,",
    "some phenomenological approaches have been advanced in an effort to account for the large experimental data on htsc .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0 dependence on the number of carriers per @xmath2 follows the so - called universal inverse parabolic curve , i.e. , @xmath3 $ ] where @xmath4 is the optimum carrier density @xmath5 and @xmath6 is an adjustable parameter which depends on the type of compound .",
    "recently we have introduced an intermediate approach@xcite which is neither pure microscopic nor pure phenomenological : it starts with the microscopic extended hubbard hamiltonian ( t - u - v ) on a square lattice of side @xmath7    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the nearest neighbor hopping integral , u is the on - site repulsion and v a phenomenological attractive interaction .",
    "several authors have argued that this hamiltonian accounts for the physics of the charge carriers@xcite in htsc .",
    "the strength of the phenomenological potential coupling constants are determined _ a posteriori _ in comparison with the experimental results for @xmath1 .",
    "the hopping integral @xmath9 is obtained by comparing with band structure calculations@xcite . using the bcs method and the fourier transform of the potential we have derived zero and finite temperature gap equations which are integrated up to region where pair formation has a non - negligible probability . in this way we have been able to relate @xmath0 , hole content @xmath5 and the strength of the zero temperature gap @xmath10 as described in detail in ref.@xcite . as concerns the phase diagram , its optimal doping is very sensitive if we move v from its original nearest neighbor position for the @xmath11-channel but does not change its optimal position for @xmath12-wave .",
    "a study of these and others channels as well as their complex mixtures and interplay as function of the position of v will be published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "this method was successfully applied to the experimental measurements of the curves @xmath1 for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 compounds@xcite . on the other hand",
    "if we study the typical parameter which characterizes the strength of the attractive interaction for a square well in 2d with range @xmath15 and strength@xcite v , @xmath16 , we see that for the above two compounds and hg1201 and , it varies between 10 - 3000 and such high values indicate that the size of the bound states ( or cooper pairs ) is related to the position of the minimum and the range of the attractive potential .",
    "this is the main motivation to change the position of the attractive potential v from the usual nearest neighbor and it is very interesting to find out that the curves for @xmath1 yield a different @xmath11-wave optimal doping value depending on the size of v while it remains fixed for @xmath12-wave .",
    "another interesting point from the theoretical point of view is that it provides a natural interpretation for the order parameter expansion introduced by the spin - fluctuation theory@xcite . in this approach",
    "it has been proposed a @xmath12-wave gap of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is expanded in powers of @xmath19 .",
    "analising this expansion , one can easily verify that it contains terms like @xmath20 which are proportional to @xmath21 and what can be seen as a type of d - wave gap symmetry that arises from a potential like @xmath22 . by the same token",
    ", we can find terms proportional to @xmath23 which can be originated by a potential @xmath24 and so on . based on this result",
    ", we adopt below a notation @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "as one expects , the more distant is the position of v , that is the larger is @xmath27 , smaller is the value of the density necessary to start the superconductivity process of pair formation . in this way we have derived @xmath1 curves@xcite",
    "that agree well with the experimental data when v was placed at @xmath28 ( s - wave ) and @xmath29 ( d - wave ) neighbors for @xmath13 and @xmath14 compounds respectively which by the way is very close the ratios of their measured coherence length @xmath30@xcite .",
    "thus the method provides a very interesting and direct interpretation for the measured values of the coherence length for the htsc compounds besides the fact that it gives a hint for the superconducting fundamental interaction in htsc .",
    "we have also extended this approach to study the pressure effects@xcite on htsc .",
    "we have noticed that @xmath31 is very sensitive to changes in the zero temperature gap amplitude @xmath10 which is used as an adjustable parameter .",
    "consequently we have introduced the assumption that the pressure induces changes on the attractive potential end ultimately on @xmath10@xcite .",
    "this assumption together with the well documented fact that the applied pressure induces a charge transfer from the reservoir layers to the @xmath2 planes , has enabled us to derive an expansion for @xmath32 in power of the pressure .",
    "this expansion was applied to the hg1201 , 1212 and 1232 compounds and has reproduced the measured values of @xmath0 for a large set of hole content and applied pressures up to 45 gpa@xcite .",
    "we should stress that since the principal interaction mechanism which forms cooper pairs has yet to be identified , the connection between @xmath0 , hole content , pressure effects and a microscopic hamiltonian should provide some clues for this interaction and it is a efficient method to obtain information on the microscopic mechanism for htsc .",
    "thus our study provides a guide to the strength and range of this fundamental mechanism .    in this paper",
    "we shall clarify and illustrate the main physical ideas of the method mentioned above and to show that it is general and can be applied to other htsc than the hg - based compounds , as we apply it to the experimental phase diagram and pressure data on bi2212 .",
    "the @xmath33 family has been studied by several groups and in particular , we shall discuss firstly the measurements of the dependence of the critical temperature @xmath0 on the hole content @xmath5@xcite to set the pertinent parameters to be used afterwards on the study of the variation of @xmath0 under applied external pressures@xcite .",
    "the is strongly anisotropic , its resistivity on the ab plane is @xmath34 larger than its similar along the c - axis@xcite which justify the use of a 2d model and has one of the shortest coherence length@xcite among all cuprates superconductors and this property will be taken into account to set the parameter @xmath27 in our calculations .",
    "following the bcs method@xcite we use a many - body wave function which describes the formation of pairs of charge carriers    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the empty band state and @xmath37 .    in connection with the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and the variational approach@xcite , we obtain    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the fourier transform of the potential of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and following along the lines of ref.@xcite may be written in a `` separable '' form , @xmath40 . a similar approach which takes next - nearest neighbor hopping into account",
    "was developed by angilella et al@xcite with the same purpose to study pressure effects on compounds but they only deal with nearest neighbor attractions . with the use of the expressions for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we get an equation for the zero temperature gap ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44 ,    thus since the gap has the same functional form of the potential , namely , @xmath45 , where the plus sign is for the s - wave and the minus sign is for d - wave channel .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath46 yields the density @xmath5 that must be calculated self - consistently@xcite but as it concerns the superconducting phase boundary it suffices to approximate it by the @xmath47k value of the maximum energy ( concentration dependent ) in the tight - binding band .    in order to study pair formation",
    ", we calculate the probability of finding a hole pair , that is , the condensation amplitude @xmath48 .",
    "it is a general result@xcite that it has a maximum at @xmath49 and drops very rapidly for @xmath50 . according to these considerations and taking @xmath51 in eq.([gap ] ) ,",
    "we obtain for s - wave    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 and @xmath55 . @xmath56 and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the maximum @xmath47 occupied values ( like a fermi momentum ) that depend on the density of holes @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is used to set the position of the attractive potential v , thus * @xmath59 for third nearest neighbor and so on*. we use @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the integrations are performed up to @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which are determined at values where the condensation amplitude becomes very small , namely , @xmath64 .",
    "this is usually attained for @xmath65 .    for @xmath66",
    ", the excitations with their respective probability must be taken into account .",
    "the derivation of a self - consistently temperature - dependent gap equation is analogous to that which leads to eq .",
    "( [ gap0 ] ) . at this point",
    ", we again follow the bcs approach@xcite and assume that @xmath67 vanishes at the critical temperature @xmath0 , which yields the following equation for s - wave symmetry ,    @xmath68    where we again integrate up to @xmath62 and @xmath63    now , if we had integrated eqs .",
    "( [ gap0 ] and [ gapt ] ) over the whole brillouin zone and solve them self - consistently , we would get @xmath69 . instead of this procedure",
    ", we find , for a given density @xmath5 , the value of @xmath0 which is compatible , i.e. , make the equality @xmath70 for a given @xmath71 and @xmath27 .",
    "this is the basic procedure of our method .",
    "the same approach can be carried out for d - wave symmetry but in this case we take @xmath72 in eqs.([gap0 ] and [ gapt ] ) .",
    "thus , with only one given value for the parameter @xmath27 and another one for @xmath71 , we can find the value of @xmath0 for a given density of carriers @xmath5 and therefore obtain the curve @xmath1 .",
    "now we turn our attention to the study of the htsc under pressure .",
    "one of the effects of the pressure which is generally accepted and well documented in certain materials is an increase of the carrier concentration on the @xmath2 planes transferred from the reservoir layers@xcite .",
    "such pressure induced charge transfer ( pict ) has been confirmed by hall effect and thermoelectric power measurements on several compounds@xcite . therefore this effect combined with an assumption of an intrinsic variation of @xmath0 ( linear on the pressure ) independently of the charge transfer was largely explored to account for the quantitative relation between @xmath0 and the pressure p and it gave origin to many models@xcite . however , the various pressure data taken with the mercury family of compounds@xcite for underdoped and overdoped compounds of @xmath73 ( hg1201 ) has some features that could not be interpreted@xcite by these pure charge transfer models by a single set of parameters .",
    "on the other hand we could explain the hg - family data using a single set of parameter and this is an achievement of our method described below .",
    "the study of @xmath74 which is necessary to find the appropriated values of @xmath27 and @xmath71 ( at @xmath75 ) demonstrated the direct proportionality between @xmath71 and @xmath0 which varies with the hole content @xmath5 and it is maximum at the optimal doping . taking this result into account and the discussion of the above paragraph",
    ", we are led to propose that the effects of pressure are two - fold : ( i)- the well accepted pict and an additional assumption ; ( ii)- a change in the attractive potential v as proposed previously by angilella et al@xcite which also implies on a change in the zero temperature gap @xmath71 .",
    "the assumption `` ii '' came from the analysis of the curves @xmath1 which have revealed that @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath71 but with a large constant of proportionality around the optimal doping@xcite @xmath4 and smaller near the both underdoped and overdoped extremes of the @xmath1 curve .",
    "the quantitative changes on v due to the applied pressure were estimated in ref.@xcite for the using the measured values@xcite of the compressibility tensor under the linear approximation and the self - consistently equations .",
    "thus the pict ( i ) implies that @xmath76 and the assumption of a pressure dependent gap ( ii ) implies that @xmath77 and both equations lead to @xmath78 . therefore to estimate @xmath0 for a given compound with a nominal value of @xmath5 and under a given pressure p",
    ", we perform an expansion of @xmath32 in terms of p. with the assumption of the linear variation of @xmath5 and @xmath79 ( or @xmath71 ) on the pressure , we obtain only terms up to third order , that is ,    [ allequations ] @xmath80 with @xmath81    and @xmath82 is just the @xmath75 term and where the derivatives @xmath83 and @xmath84 are determined by comparing with the experimental data ; @xmath83 can be estimated by a set of values @xmath85 for a given density @xmath5 and @xmath84 can be determined by hall coefficients or thermoelectric power measurements . after determined these parameters",
    ", one can derive analytical expressions for each coefficient as function of @xmath5 ; using the universal parabolic fitting we can obtain a analytical expression for @xmath86 and studying the phase diagram for different values of @xmath10 , we can calculate @xmath87 which calculates the @xmath0 dependency on p ( assumption ii ) .",
    "this procedure gives an intrinsic term which has a clear interpretation since it comes from the changes in @xmath71 as well as a new third order term .",
    "it is remarkable that with a single set of parameters calculated for hg1201 , with just the change in @xmath79 , we were also able to apply the same expansion ( with same coefficients ) to hg1212 and hg1223 .",
    "in order to apply the entire approach described above , we start with the @xmath75 curve @xmath1 for which allows us to determine the initial parameters @xmath27 and @xmath71 .",
    "we have used the values @xmath88 and v@xmath89 given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the coherence length estimate for is @xmath90 which is about 10% less than the @xmath30 for ybacuo@xcite .",
    "since we have used @xmath91 for fitting the phase diagram for these compounds , we use here @xmath92 in order to obtain @xmath1 for .",
    "the results are displayed on fig.1 and one can see that it provides a very reasonable fitting for the experimental points of allgeier et al@xcite . in order to match the @xmath93 with v@xmath89 , we used @xmath94k which is the same for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "this value is very close @xmath95k used to the hg1210 compounds because both compounds have very closed values for @xmath96k and we used for both a @xmath11 gap function .",
    "we have also plotted a parametric curve which has been applied to fit the experimental points , @xmath3 $ ] with @xmath93k and @xmath97 .",
    "however the data of huang et al@xcite appears to have smaller @xmath79 , displaced toward higher hole densities and they are fitted with @xmath98 .",
    "the parabolic is a pure phenomenological fitting which is used here only because it provides a analytical expression that can be used in the pressure expansion to estimate @xmath99 .    now that _ @xmath27 and @xmath71 has been determined _ let us study the compound under applied pressure . from the analysis of the phase diagram@xcite shown in fig.1 and by varying the value of @xmath71 around the @xmath75 value of @xmath94k , we can infer that @xmath100 at @xmath101 which is near the optimal doping value of hole content used by angilella et al@xcite . from the hall coefficient measurements@xcite",
    ", we get @xmath102 and since their results seens to be shifted to larger values of hole contents , we estimate @xmath103 _ which is two order of magnitude higher than previously derived @xmath104 for the pressure effects on hg compounds@xcite . _ from the low pressure data we can get @xmath105 which allows us to derive the value @xmath106 which is necessary to determine all the high order coefficients . we noticed that this value is very close to @xmath107 derived for the hg - based htsc . now",
    ", with the values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 determined , we can calculate the high order terms of eq.[coeff ] and in particular , we obtain @xmath110 .",
    "the third order coefficient was also calculated but it does not give any appreciable contribution in the range of pressure below @xmath111 .",
    "thus with all the coefficients of eq.[coeff ] determined , we are all set to calculate the values of @xmath32 .",
    "the calculated results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data@xcite as it is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the large value of @xmath109 yields a very large negative second order coefficient @xmath112 what makes the curve change its derivative at @xmath113 gpa . for the hg compounds the change in sign of @xmath114 occurs at much larger @xmath115 gpa and",
    "from the above analysis we can see that this difference in behavior is due to the large difference on the value of the charge transfer @xmath109 for this two compounds .",
    "thus , we conclude this work pointing out that our novel calculations based on a bcs type mean field and on the extended hubbard hamiltonian with the position of v as a variable parameter , is appropriate to describe the interplay between the @xmath0 and hole content for htsc .",
    "the change in the position of the attractive interaction provides informations on the range of the cooper pair attractive mechanism .",
    "our method yields also a novel and systematic way to study the effects of the pressure and gives indication that the pressure induces a variation on the attractive potential which in turn , gives an intuitive interpretation on the origin of the intrinsic term .",
    "we should also emphasize that our procedure is _ based and has its starting point on a microscopic hamiltonian _ and it differs from some pure phenomenological ways to fit the data@xcite that uses a parabolic fitting to the experimental pressure data and are in the same category of the inverse parabolic fitting for the @xmath1 curves mentioned above that are useful to obtain information on the different sets of data but has not any microscopic implications which is our main concern here . by applying it to the superconductors and comparing the results with our previous calculations on hg - based htsc we have seen that the method not only deals successfully with the the experimental results but also displays clearly the physical properties that accounts for their different experimental behavior under pressure .",
