    "the investigations in this paper are focused on the analysis of the low - speed , or low - froude , wave models proposed by @xcite , in which blunt - bodied ships are studied in the context of potential flow and asymptotic expansions in powers of the froude number . as a particularly interesting case that draws our attention",
    ", we recall the work of @xcite , who showed that by attaching a bulbous - like obstruction to an otherwise rectangular ship s stern , one could produce a dramatic effect on the production of transverse waves . as they reported in their paper :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ at this [ froude number ] , a rectangular stern generates waves with steepness @xmath0 , whereas the stern with the downward - pointing bulb [  ] yields waves with steepness @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that the addition of the downward - pointing bulb has had a dramatic effect on the downstream wave steepness , reducing it by a factor of 7.2 , although it has still not eliminated the waves entirely . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    our goal is to give an analytical criterion that explains why this phenomenon occurs ; that is to say , what distinguishes the two ships , one with a bulb and one without a bulb , in the context of the ` slow - ship ' approximation ?",
    "the advantage of the slow - ship potential - flow approximation , is that allows us to directly relate the generation of waves to the shape of the ship s hull without the need for numerical simulations .",
    "in addition to addressing the @xcite issue , we are also interested in a more general question : in the low - speed limit , when a blunt ship is modeled as a two - dimensional semi - infinite body , can it ever be made waveless ?",
    "these waveless or wave - minimisation questions in the context of the @xcite approximation were studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for ship hulls of varying geometries , and we are interested in continuing their line of inquiry .    in the previous part of our work ( @xcite ) , we demonstrated that piecewise - linear hulls with a single , submerged corner can never be made waveless .",
    "for the case of piecewise - linear hulls with multiple corners , the answer to this question is not as clear .",
    "for example , are any of the eight hulls presented in figure [ fig : nhull_ships ] waveless ? if not , then which ones produce the smallest waves ? for the case of potential flow over a submerged obstruction ,",
    "waveless configurations are certainly possible ,",
    "as was demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite , but the same question for surface - piercing ships of general form remains open .",
    "certainly , there are notable difficulties in studying this problem .",
    "for example , waveless ships were proposed by @xcite and @xcite , but these were later refuted in the more comprehensive numerical study by @xcite , in which they showed that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the free surface would at first sight appear to be waveless , but on closer examination of the numerical data , there are very small waves present and they have a steepness of @xmath2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in reference to the bulbous hull in @xcite .",
    "our desire , then , is to study these issues in terms of the low - froude asymptotic expansions .    ]",
    "having progressed through the theory of @xcite , we know that at low froude numbers , the waves generated by a ship become exponentially small and are thus invisible to a regular asymptotic expansion .",
    "the ineffectiveness of traditional asymptotics in capturing the low - speed limit was first remarked by @xcite and later termed the _ low - speed paradox_. techniques in exponential asymptotics @xcite allow us to demonstrate the fact that these hidden waves are switched - on when the regular expansion is continued across critical curves ( _ stokes lines _ ) in the complex plane ; this process is known as the _ stokes phenomenon_. most important , however , is the valuable insight that these approximations give : an explicit formula that relates the shape of an arbitrary hull with its resultant waves .",
    "the question of wavelessness in the low - froude limit is then simplified to examining whether the sum of the stokes line contributions can ever be zero in regions far from the ship .",
    "the requisite background in exponential asymptotics can be found in @xcite .",
    "the techniques we apply are based on the use of a factorial over power ansatz to capture the divergence of the asymptotic expansions , then optimal truncation and stokes line smoothing to relate the late - order terms to the exponentially small waves [ see for example , papers by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ] .",
    "our paper also parallels the works of @xcite and @xcite on the application of exponential asymptotics to the study of gravity or capillary waves produced by flow over a submerged object .",
    "it is important for us to mention that the low - froude model of @xcite is indeed a very _ idealised _",
    "approximation for understanding the production of ship waves . real stern and",
    "bow flows are very complex , and viscosity , turbulence , and necklace vorticies can all play an important role in the production of waves .",
    "we refer the reader to , for example , some of the numerical simulations of @xcite and @xcite that demonstrate some of the complex dynamics that arise in ship flows once , for example , vorticity and viscosity are included . in  [ sec : discuss ] of this paper , we shall return to discuss the caveats of the low - speed approximation .    ultimately , we are interested in obtaining analytical intuition about the connection between the ship s hull and the waves produced .",
    "the more usual routes towards analytical solutions assumes an asymptotically small geometry , which leads to the ` thin - ship ' , ` flat - ship ' or ` streamline - ship ' approximations ; in such regimes , a waveless ship is impossible ( see for example , @xcite and krein in @xcite ) , but these theories say very little about the case of non - thin ships .",
    "other examples of ship wave models can be studied , including the kelvin - neumann formulation in which the free surface condition is linearised about a steady uniform stream annd the boundary condition on the ship s hull is satisfied exactly , but generally these problems do require a degree of numerical computation .",
    "a discussion of such problems can be found in the book by @xcite and the review and discussion by @xcite ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for more recent work on rigorous results applicable to non - slender geometries ) .",
    "we finally refer readers to the reviews by @xcite and @xcite for a summary of the role played by low - froude approximations , particularly in connection with problems in which we require asymptotic solutions that preserve the nonlinearity of the geometry .",
    "the paper will proceed as follows .",
    "first , the mathematical formulation of the ship - wave problem is briefly recapitulated in  [ sec : nhull_form ] .",
    "this is followed by the asymptotic analysis of the low - froude problem in  [",
    "sec : nhull_asymptotic ] , which culminates with the derivation of explicit expressions for the wake of an arbitrary multi - cornered ship . from these analytical results , we explain why certain classes of multi - cornered ships can never be made waveless in  [ sec : nhull_nonexistence ] , then in  [ sec : nhull_numerical ] , these theoretical results are vindicated by comparisons with numerical computations .",
    "consider steady , incompressible , irrotational , inviscid flow in the presence of gravity , past the semi - infinite body shown in figure [ fig : nhull_nhull ] , which consists of a flat bottom and a piecewise linear front face .",
    "there is a uniform stream of speed @xmath3 as @xmath4 , and we assume that the flow attaches to stern at a stagnation point , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the dimensional problem can be reposed in terms of a non - dimensional boundary - integral formulation in the potential @xmath7-plane .",
    "the unknowns are the fluid speed @xmath8 , and streamline angles , @xmath9 , measured from the positive @xmath10-axis .",
    "the body and free - surface are given by the streamline @xmath11 , and we assume the free - surface ( @xmath12 ) attaches to the hull ( @xmath13 ) at @xmath14 . the free - surface , with @xmath11 ,",
    "is then obtained by solving a boundary - integral equation , coupled with bernoulli s condition :    [ eq : nhulleqtogether ] @xmath15    where @xmath16 is related to the square of the froude draft number with upstream flow @xmath3 , and @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of corners and @xmath20 is the dimensional value of the potential at each of the corners . in this way , if @xmath21 for @xmath22 denotes the value of the potential at the corners in the non - dimensionalised problem , we have the property that @xmath23 .",
    "the derivation of ( [ eq : nhulleqtogether ] ) can be found in @xcite , and the only difference is the choice of scaling for the froude number .",
    "we shall refer to the @xmath19-cornered piecewise - linear hull as an @xmath19-hull .",
    "for @xmath24 the geometry of the hull can be described by @xmath25    for @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the stagnation point , and @xmath29 is the exterior angle at the @xmath30th corner ( see figure [ fig : nhull_nhull ] ) .",
    "when @xmath31 , we will sometimes also refer to the ship as a @xmath32$]-hull .",
    "the @xmath19 corners of exterior angles @xmath33 in the @xmath34 plane ( left ) are mapped to @xmath35 in the complex potential plane ( right ) .",
    "the stagnation point is @xmath36 .",

    "note also that the product representation of the complex quantity @xmath43 can be alternately derived by using a schwartz - christoffel mapping applied to the polygonal hull shape and a rigid , flat free surface .    as explained in @xcite , in order to study the stokes phenomenon , we must ` complexify ' the free - surface , and thus allow @xmath44 and @xmath45 to be complex functions of the complex potential , @xmath46 . analytically continuing",
    "( [ eq : nhull_bdint ] ) and ( [ eq : nhull_bern ] ) gives    @xmath47    where the @xmath48 signs correspond to analytic continuation in the upper and lower - half @xmath49 planes , respectively , and @xmath50 denotes the hilbert transform operator on the free - surface , @xmath51",
    "a single - cornered ship will always produce exponentially small waves in the low froude limit , @xmath52 ; these waves are explained by the presence of a stokes line which emerges from the singularity at the corner . for a multi - cornered ship , the analysis proceeds almost identically to @xcite , except now , each corner of the hull has the potential to produce stokes lines and its own separate wave contribution . in this section",
    ", we shall briefly re - apply the methodology of the previous work , and provide the corresponding formulae for the case of an @xmath19-hull .      here , we perform the asymptotic analysis which corresponds to analytically continuing the free - surface into the upper - half @xmath49-plane ; continuation into the lower - half plane produces a complex conjugate contribution , which we add to our results , later .",
    "we begin by substituting the usual asymptotic expansions @xmath53    into ( [ eq : nhull_bdint2 ] ) and ( [ eq : nhull_bern2 ] ) ( with the @xmath54 sign ) . in the limit @xmath52",
    ", the leading - order solution is the rigid - wall flow of ( [ eq : nhull_rigid ] ) , @xmath55    notice that the leading - order solution , @xmath56 in ( [ eq : nhull_rigid2 ] ) , possesses a singularity at each of the corners , @xmath57 .",
    "however , the solution at each subsequent order involves a derivative of the previous order , so we would thus expect that as @xmath58 , the power of the singularity grows , and the asymptotic expansions ( [ eq : nhull_asympt ] ) exhibit factorial over power divergence : @xmath59    where @xmath60 is complex constant , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are functions of the complex potential @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . for most of the analysis , however , we can simply choose one of the corners of interest and add the individual contributions at the end .",
    "the singularities , @xmath57 , are located off the free surface , where the hilbert transform in ( [ eq : nhull_bdint2 ] ) is evaluated and so , as justified in @xcite , @xmath65 is exponentially subdominant to the terms on the left - hand side for large @xmath66 . at @xmath67 , ( [ eq : nhull_bdint2 ] ) gives @xmath68    as @xmath69 , and substitution into ( [ eq : nhull_bern2 ] ) gives the relevant terms at @xmath67 : @xmath70 + \\biggl [ 2q_0 ^ 2q_0'q_{n-1 } + 2q_0 ^ 2q_1q_{n-2 } ' - i\\frac{q_{n-1 } q_1}{q_0}\\biggr ] + \\ldots = 0 .",

    "in fact , a stronger condition for the existence of a stokes line emerging on the relevant riemann sheet can be derived . since @xmath88 , we can write @xmath89    for analytic continuation into the upper - half plane , where @xmath90 is the angle of the hull as @xmath91 , measured from the positive @xmath10-axis ( shown in figure [ fig : nhull_nhull ] )",

    "now for a fixed value of @xmath138 this may indeed be possible ( and we give such an example in  [ sec : nhull_numerical ] ) , but what if we want the waves to vanish for _ all _ ( small ) values of @xmath138 ? then , since each @xmath75 is of the form @xmath139    as @xmath140 , we need the exponentials to be equal , the powers of @xmath138 to be equal , and the prefactors to be equal . in order for the exponentials to be equal",
    ", we require @xmath141    and since @xmath142    the only way ( [ 1 ] ) can hold is if @xmath143 , so that @xmath144 is real for @xmath145 . now , for the algebraic factors of @xmath138 to be equal , we require @xmath146 , which implies @xmath147 . thus the only possibility for a waveless 2-hull is for a ship with @xmath148 . to eliminate this final possibility we need to consider the prefactors .",
    "since @xmath149    and @xmath144 is real for @xmath145 , then @xmath150    the only remaining difference between the two prefactors is in @xmath151 .",
    "however , since @xmath152 the only way that we can have @xmath153 is if @xmath154 .",
    "thus the two prefactors must be different , one corner always dominates the other one , and the waves can never cancel .",
    "waveless ships with two corners are not possible .",
    "what can we say about more general ships ?",
    "let us take a general @xmath19-hull with the following assumptions : suppose that all the stokes lines intersect the free surface , that @xmath155 for each @xmath30 , and that @xmath156 . in figure 1 , hulls ( a ) to ( e )",
    "satisfy this requirement , whereas hulls ( f ) to ( h ) do not . under these assumptions",
    ", @xmath157 is monotonically increasing with @xmath30 , so that @xmath158 is monotonically decreasing .",
    "thus the argument of the exponential @xmath159    is convex in @xmath30 , increasing while @xmath160 and then decreasing while @xmath161 .",
    "thus if @xmath162 for all @xmath163 then we can see immediately that the waves generated at the corner @xmath30 such that @xmath164 exponentially dominate all the others . on the other hand , if @xmath165 then the waves from corners @xmath30 and @xmath166 have the same exponential factor ( as in the 2-hull case ) .",
    "if we further impose @xmath167 then they have the same algebraic factor , and there is possibility of wave cancellation if the prefactors are equal .    of course , even if we could get the prefactors to be equal , we still have to worry about the waves generated by all the other corners .",
    "in fact , even from these two corners there would be higher - order correction terms ( both in the form @xmath168 , @xmath169 , _ etc . _ and also in the form of a trans - series @xmath170 , @xmath171 _ etc .",
    ". thus it does not seem to be worth pursuing the analysis further .",
    "however , even if we can not get the waves to cancel exactly , we might expect a significant reduction in the amplitude of the waves in the case when leading - order cancellation occurs .",
    "this brings us to the natural question of whether the analysis we have presented may be used to design a hull to minimise the wave drag .",
    "before we address this question , let us first demonstrate that the hulls shown in figure 1 ( f ) through ( h ) must generate waves on the free surface .",
    "we consider them in reverse order .",
    "the 9-hull shown in figure 1(h ) has @xmath172 ( as shown in figure 3 ) , with @xmath158 alternating between zero and @xmath173 ; thus the argument above can be used to show that the contribution from @xmath174 exponentially dominates all the others . the hull shown in figure 1(g )",
    "has @xmath175 , with three positive angles @xmath176 and one negative angle .",
    "thus the algebraic factor in the contribution from @xmath177 is different to the others , and those waves must always exist on the free surface .    finally let us consider the 3-hull shown in figure 1(f ) , which is found in the work of @xcite , and for which the addition of a downward pointing bulb was shown to dramatically reduce the wave resistance compared to a rectangular ship . in this case ,",
    "@xmath178 , and @xmath179 is the only relevant corner , so there are always waves on the free surface . the principal effect of the bulb is to lower the usual singularity farther away from the free surface , thereby decreasing the amplitude of the waves .",
    "this last example not only highlights the difficulty in trying to minimise the wave drag , but also the advantage of our semi - analytic approach : we have gained considerable insight into the mechanism of wave production ; from this , we can immediately see why farrow & tuck obtained the results that they did .    in trying to design reduced - wave hulls , it is crucial to specify what exactly is the optimisation process .",
    "for example , if we simplify the hull of farrow & tuck to a 2-hull by reducing the width of the downward pointing bulb to zero , then we have one parameter , @xmath174 , over which we can optimise ( since @xmath180 ) .",
    "we find the smallest waves occur for @xmath181 , _",
    "i.e. _ when there is no bulb .",
    "however , in our current nondimensionalisation , as we vary @xmath174 , both the depth of the hull and that of the bulb vary .",
    "if instead we fix the depth of the hull , and allow the depth of the bulb to vary , we find that the waves get smaller as the bulb gets deeper .",
    "on the other hand , if we fix the depth of the bulb , and allow the depth of the hull to vary , we again find that the smallest waves correspond to the hull depth being equal to the bulb depth , _",
    "i.e. _ to there being no bulb .",
    "the numerical algorithms developed in @xcite can be used to verify the asymptotic predictions . here",
    ", we focus on the particular case of a @xmath97-hull , which we refer to as a @xmath182$]-hull ; this is a ship with divergent corner - angles @xmath183 and @xmath184 , and with leading - order flow given by ( [ eq : nhull_rigid ] ) , or @xmath185    with @xmath186 .",
    "as we discussed in @xcite , the numerical computation of the stern problem at small values of @xmath138 can be particularly difficult , and the culprit is the presence of the attachment singularity at @xmath187 , associated with a small boundary layer ; this singularity is responsible for most of the numerical error . for hulls where the in - fluid attachment angle between the free - surface and body is less than @xmath188 , a simple finite difference scheme based on the methods outlined in @xcite can be used , provided that we limit our search to waves larger than @xmath189 .",

    "the solutions were computed using algorithm a of @xcite .",
    "the parameters used were the following : @xmath195 , @xmath199 ; @xmath200 , @xmath201 ; and @xmath197 , @xmath202 . [",

    "the ship is a @xmath203$]-hull with @xmath186 and @xmath204 .",
    "the dotted line indicates the one - cornered approximation for a rectangular hull .",
    "[ fig : nhull_cc2525.1 ] ]    next , we would like to consider the effect of fixing the froude number , but varying the positions of the corners .",
    "the problem , however , is that the interesting effects of this procedure are only seen at values of @xmath138 much smaller than what we can achieve using the above numerical methods . in appendix",
    "[ sec : cc_simpnon ] , we present a slightly simplified version of the ship - wave problem ( [ eq : nhull_bdint2])([eq : nhull_bern2 ] ) that preserves the asymptotic structure of the waves , but also enables us to compute numerical solutions to much higher accuracy .    this simplified problem was used to create figure [ fig : nhull_cc2525.1 ] , which shows the effect of varying the positions of the corners on the wave amplitude for a @xmath203$]-hull with @xmath204 , @xmath186 , and values of @xmath205 .",
    "the figure contains a number of interesting effects : the first is that the numerically computed wave amplitude shows a significant dip ( an order of magnitude ) near @xmath206 , and that this effect is also captured fairly accurately in the asymptotic solution .",
    "the reason for the dip is that at this value of @xmath174 , the waves from the two corners exhibit partial destructive interference .",
    "however , from the of the previous section , we know that the waves generated by the corner at @xmath207 should exponentially dominate those from @xmath208 .",
    "how then are they cancelling each other ?",
    "the answer is that the prefactor @xmath209 is over ten times larger than @xmath210 ; at this particular value of @xmath138 , the difference in prefactors is enough to compensate for the difference in exponentials , since @xmath211    is not very large .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath174 at which cancellation occurs depends on @xmath138 ; for somewhat smaller of @xmath138 the stokes line from @xmath212 does indeed dominate and no cancellation is possible .",
    "this indicates that it should be possible to design hulls with reduced wave drag at a particular speed ( froude number ) .",
    "it is also reassuring to note that including the leading - order term from each of our exponentially - small waves captures the behaviour of the solution very well , even though formally , one of the terms is exponentially subdominant .    the second effect illustrated by figure [ fig : nhull_cc2525.1 ] is the divergence between our asymptotic expansion and the numerical solution for values of @xmath174 close to @xmath213 .",
    "the reason for the divergence is that the prefactors @xmath214 and @xmath215 are singular as the corners approach each other ; our analysis in  [ sec : nhull_asymptotic ] , in fact , implicitly assumes that the corners of the ship are spaced sufficiently far from one another .    to be more specific , in order to determine the constants @xmath60 and @xmath75 in ( [ eq : nhull_gammak ] ) and ( [ eq : nhull_lambdak ] ) in the previous analysis , the outer solution was required to match a nonlinear inner solution .",
    "the size of this inner region can be derived by observing where the breakdown in the outer expansion ( [ eq : nhull_asympt ] ) first occurs , _",
    "i.e. _ where @xmath216 . from ( [ eq : nhull_rigid2 ] ) and ( [ eq : nhull_q1 ] ) , the required re - scaling of @xmath63 near a singularity at @xmath217 can be seen to be @xmath218    thus , if two ( or more ) singularities are spaced within a distance of ( [ eq : nhull_innerscaling ] ) apart , then the previous asymptotic methodology breaks down as @xmath52 .",
    "if we combine the two corners into a single corner of angle @xmath219 , we find the wave amplitude is given by the dotted line in figure [ fig : nhull_cc2525.1 ] .",
    "this approximation clearly works well for @xmath174 close to 0.5 .",
    "a uniform approximation would need to smoothly match with the one - cornered approximation at one end , and the ( separated ) two - cornered analysis at the other , and thus bridges the dashed and dotted lines in figure [ fig : nhull_cc2525.1 ] .",
    "such an approximation requires us to consider the distinguished limit in which the corners of the ship are allowed to approach one another as @xmath52 .",
    "this is similar to the situation in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) where the asymptotic solutions for flow over a rectangular step in a channel was analysed in the case where both corners of the step lie in the same ` inner region ' . for the case of the multi - cornered ship ,",
    "the details of this analysis are very technical , and will be published in a future paper .",
    "_ in the end , what is the definitive answer to the conundrum of existence and non - existence of waveless ships ?",
    "_ unlike our results for the single - cornered ships of @xcite , there does not seem to be a simple answer to this question , applicable to the most general piecewise - linear hulls . despite this",
    ", however , we have offered several new insights into the study of ship - wave resistance : we have offered explicit formulae for the computation of waves given the shape of the ship s hull ; we have offered simple interpretations of the production of such waves in terms of stokes line crossings and the stokes phenomenon ; and perhaps most importantly , we offered a methodology which , given specific ships , provides an immediate and intuitive understanding of the effect of the body on the free - surface .    in the previous work",
    ", we highlighted the importance of distinguishing between local and global properties of the analysis .",
    "consider the factorial over power divergence of the asymptotic series in ( [ eq : nhull_ansatz ] ) , or the emergence - conditions of stokes lines in ( [ eq : nhull_stokescond ] ) , or the numerically - determined pre - factor , @xmath220 , in ( [ eq : nhull_omega_k])these are all _ local _ properties of the problem ; indeed their derivation only depends on the behaviour of the asymptotic solution near the relevant singularities .",
    "these local properties , we understand well .    in contrast ,",
    "global _ questions remain unanswered . for example , given a ship , represented by @xmath56 , what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for stokes lines to intersect the free surface ? or perhaps more difficult : what are the necessary restrictions on @xmath56 so that total phase cancellation occurs ?",
    "we have provided a few preliminary results on this global problem , but a more exhaustive analysis of these issues remains an open problem .",
    "naturally , our study of ship waves would be incomplete without a theory applicable for smooth hulls , with the eventual goal of addressing the well - known technique of using a bulb to reduce the wave resistance of a ship @xcite .",
    "however , the difficulty here is that analytic continuation is an ill - posed process and small perturbations in the shape of a hull can have large effects on the associated singularities  a unified theory for arbitrary ship geometries will likely prove difficult , if not downright impossible .",
    "perhaps , then , we should only consider specific classes of smooth ships .",
    "ship waves associated with continuous geometries have been considered in the numerical work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , where there , the hulls are specified by piecewise - entire functions .",
    "for example , @xcite consider the family of hulls given by @xmath221    which , given parameters @xmath222 and @xmath223 , provides a ship consisting of a horizontal bottom and a vertical line , joined by a rounded section ; @xmath224 yields rounded corners and @xmath225 yields bulbous sterns .",
    "the key is that if we restrict ourselves to classes of ships given by piecewise entire functions , then the complex singularities must be located at the points joining each piece . as a simpler example",
    ", we may consider the ship with @xmath226 & \\text{for $ w\\in(-a_1,-a_2)$ } \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\pi}{2 } & \\text{for $ w\\in(-a_2,0)$ } , \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    which is similar to the vertically - faced one - cornered ships studied previously , but with a rounded edge .",
    "analysis of the stokes lines shows that the relevant line emerges from @xmath227 ; this is shown in figure [ fig : remarks_smhull ] .",
    "the study of these piecewise - entire ships is the subject of ongoing investigation .    ) with @xmath193 and @xmath228 .",
    "the stokes line leaves tangentially along the boundary , but later intersects the free - surface .",
    "[ fig : remarks_smhull ] ]    a similar direction for research is towards the development of a low - froude asymptotic theory for flows past three - dimensional , full - bodied ships .",
    "this builds upon the works of , for example , @xcite and @xcite , who apply geometrical ray theory to the case of streamline ( thin ) ships . in theory , the interpretation we have presented in this paper of free - surface waves arising due to stokes line crossings is still valid in three dimensions , except now , singularities are associated with stokes _ surfaces _ rather than _",
    "lines_. in practice , however , the analysis is complicated due to the loss of complex variable techniques .",
    "we refer the reader to the work of @xcite , which provides a first step towards extensions of exponential asymptotics to partial differential equations .",
    "in addition to our study , which solely focuses on the low - froude model of @xcite , it is important for us to question the place of these simplified mathematical models in terms of the bigger picture : that which includes the effects of vorticity , viscosity , and time - dependence in ship - wave interactions .",
    "as we elucidated in the introduction , numerical work ( as particular examples , see @xcite and @xcite ) show that in practice , these neglected effects can have significant roles in the production of waves .",
    "extended discussions of the role of low - froude theories appear in @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "thus , while it is certainly true that in order to obtain _ analytical _ approximations directly relating ship geometries to free - surface waves , the low - froude approximation provides enormous simplification , we hope that similar analytical theories can be developed which include a more complete host of effects .",

    "the reason for this simplification is that , in order to verify the asymptotic analysis in the regime where the ship s corners are closely spaced , wave amplitudes must be computed to five or six digits of precision  otherwise , the fine effects of adjusting the ship s geometry are easily missed ; this precision can only be easily achieved for the simpler problem , which we now derive .    as we know",
    ", when exponentially small terms are sought from ( [ eq : nhull_bdint2 ] ) , the integral term , @xmath229 , only serves a minor role throughout the analysis .",
    "if we return to the derivation of the late - orders ansatz ( [ eq : nhull_ansatz ] ) , we recall that the subdominance of @xmath229 as @xmath58 ensures that it plays no part in the derivation of @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , the only role of the hilbert transform is to change the expression for @xmath230 in ( [ eq : nhull_q1 ] ) .",
    "consequently , in the final form of the waves @xmath130 in ( [ eq : nhull_qexpk ] ) , the presence of @xmath231 only serves to change the amplitude coefficient and the phase shift by an @xmath232 amount .",

    "simplifications of the boundary integral problem ( [ eq : nhull_bdint2 ] ) and ( [ eq : nhull_bern2 ] ) were also proposed in @xcite , but there , the simplifications were argued based on behavioural requirements . here , ( [ eq : nhull_simpbern ] ) is a justified reduction based on the @xmath52 limit .",

    "<S> in the low - speed limit , a blunt ship modeled as two - dimensional semi - infinite body with a single corner _ can never be made waveless_. this was the conclusion of the previous part of our work in @xcite , which focused on the @xcite model of ship waves in the low speed limit . in this accompanying paper </S>",
    "<S> , we continue our investigations with the study of more general , piecewise - linear , or multi - cornered ships . </S>",
    "<S> the low - speed or low - froude limit , coupled with techniques in exponential asymptotics allows us to derive explicit formulae relating the geometry of the hull to the form of the waves . </S>",
    "<S> configurations with closely spaced corners present a non - trivial extension of the theory , and we present the general methodology for their study . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , numerical computations of the nonlinear ship - wave problem are presented in order to confirm the analytical predictions .    </S>",
