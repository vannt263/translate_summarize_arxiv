    "<S> the fundamental measure density functional theory for hard spheres is generalized to binary mixtures of arbitrary positive and moderate negative non - additivity between unlike components . in bulk </S>",
    "<S> the theory predicts fluid - fluid phase separation into phases with different chemical compositions . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the accompanying critical point agrees well with previous results from simulations over a broad range of non - additivities and both for symmetric and highly asymmetric size ratios . </S>",
    "<S> results for partial pair correlation functions show good agreement with simulation data .    density - functional theory ( dft ) </S>",
    "<S> is a powerful approach to study equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous systems , including dense liquids and solids of single- and multi - component substances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its practical applicability depends on the quality of the approximation to the central object , the ( helmholtz ) excess free energy functional arising from the interparticle interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the specific model of additive hard sphere mixtures constitutes the reference system par excellence to describe mixtures governed by steric repulsion , and rosenfeld s fundamental - measure theory ( fmt ) @xcite is arguably the best available approximation to tackle inhomogeneous situations . </S>",
    "<S> a rapidly increasing number of applications to interesting physical problems can be witnessed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the more general non - additive hard sphere mixture is defined through pair potentials between particles of species @xmath0 and @xmath1 , given as @xmath2 for @xmath3 and 0 otherwise , where @xmath4 is the center - center distance between the two particles , and @xmath5 is the distance of minimal approach between particles of species @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in a binary mixture non - additivity is measured conventionally through the parameter @xmath6 . the physics of non - additive hard sphere mixtures is considerably richer than that of the additive case . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the case of @xmath7 is striking , as small values of @xmath8 are known to be already sufficient to induce stable fluid - fluid demixing into phases with different chemical compositions ( for recent studies see e.g.  references @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the treatment of general non - additivity is elusive in the fmt framework . </S>",
    "<S> the author is aware of successful studies only in four special cases : first , for the asakura - oosawa - vrij ( aov ) model @xcite , where species 1 represents colloidal hard spheres and species 2 ( with @xmath9 ) represents non - interacting polymer coils with radius of gyration equal to @xmath10 , an excess free energy functional was given @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , a free energy functional for the widom - rowlinson ( wr ) model , where @xmath11 , was obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , the depletion potential between two big spheres immersed in a sea of smaller spheres was obtained through `` roth s trick '' of working on the level of the one - body direct correlation functional @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the functional for the additive case is sufficient to obtain results , but the approach is limited to small concentration of big spheres . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , in lafuente and cuesta s fmt for lattice hard core models , due the an odd - even effect of the particle sizes ( measured in units of lattice constants ) , non - additivity of the size of one lattice spacing arises @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , however , is specific to lattice models and vanishes in the continuum limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present letter is to generalize fmt for hard spheres to the case of general positive and moderate negative non - additivity and arbitrary size asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed extended framework accommodates , in the respective limits , the rosenfeld functional for additive hard sphere mixtures @xcite , the dft for the extreme non - additive aov case @xcite , and the exact virial expansion up to second order in densities . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the theory , however , goes qualitatively beyond that of either limit .     between pairs of particles of species </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 and 22 are related to radii through @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the spheres of radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the weight functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , and can be viewed as `` true '' particle shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the sphere of radius @xmath20 represents the kernel @xmath21 being a mere construct to generate the correct hard core distance @xmath22 between species 1 and  2 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the excess ( over ideal ) helmholtz free energy functional is expressed as @xmath23 = k_bt\\int d{{\\bf x}}d{{\\bf x } } '     \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta=0}^3 k^{(12)}_{\\alpha\\beta}(|{{\\bf x}}-{{\\bf x}}'| )    \\phi_{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(\\{n_\\nu^{(1)}({{\\bf x}})\\},\\{n_\\tau^{(2)}({{\\bf x}}')\\}\\right ) ,    \\label{eqfexc}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the one - body density distributions of species @xmath25 dependent on position  @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the thermal energy , @xmath28 for @xmath29 is the free energy density depending on the sets of weighted densities @xmath30 for @xmath25 , and the kernels @xmath31 are a means to control the range of non - locality between unlike components and depend solely on distance @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the weighted densities are built in the usual way  @xcite through convolution of the respective bare density profile with appropriate weight functions : @xmath32 where @xmath33 labels the type of weight function , and @xmath34 is the particle radius of species @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the ( fully scalar ) kierlik - rosinberg form @xcite of the @xmath35 is used in the following , as this renders the determination of the @xmath31 more straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath35 are @xmath36 where @xmath37 , the prime denotes the derivative w.r.t .  the argument , @xmath38 is the dirac distribution , and @xmath39 is the step function . alternatively , in fourier space </S>",
    "<S> the weight functions are @xmath40 and given as @xmath41 with the abbreviations @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the kernels @xmath31 in ( [ eqfexc ] ) can be viewed as @xmath44-components of a second - rank tensor @xmath45 where indexing is such that the top row contains @xmath46 , etc , and @xmath47 distinguishes different elements . </S>",
    "<S> all @xmath31 possess a range of @xmath48 , i.e.  vanish for values of @xmath4 beyond that distance ( see figure [ figillustration ] for an illustration of the length scales ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension of @xmath21 is @xmath49 , and hence the dimension of @xmath50 is @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the elements of @xmath52 are defined , with @xmath53 , through ( [ eqwfirst ] ) , and furthermore @xmath54 with the derivatives @xmath55 for @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> again we also give the fourier space representation [ being together with ( [ eqweightsinfourierspace ] ) also valid for @xmath57 , which reads @xmath58 in order to express the dependence of the free energy density , @xmath28 in equation ( [ eqfexc ] ) , on the weighted densities ( [ eqweighteddensities ] ) we introduce ansatz functions @xmath59 for species @xmath25 that possess the dimension of @xmath60 and the order @xmath61 in density ( i.e.  contain @xmath61 factors @xmath62 ) . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions for the non - vanishing terms are @xmath63 the excess free energy density is then constructed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the @xmath61th derivative of the zero - dimensional excess free energy as a function of the average occupation number @xmath66 @xcite , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the specific form ( [ eqphiofweighteddensities ] ) ensures both that the terms in the sum in ( [ eqfexc ] ) possesses the correct dimension of @xmath70 and that the prefactor of @xmath71 in ( [ eqphiofweighteddensities ] ) is of the total order @xmath61 in densities , as is common in fmt . </S>",
    "<S> this completes the prescription for the functional ; a full account of all details , also for multi - component mixtures and for lower spatial dimensionality , will be given elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss some of the properties of the theory . for small densities </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show that the correct virial expansion up to second order in densities is obtained , @xmath72 , where the mayer functions , @xmath73 , are recovered through @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the convolution , @xmath76 . in the limit of an additive mixture , @xmath77 and hence @xmath78 , one finds that @xmath79 if @xmath80 and @xmath81 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a cancellation of one spatial integration in ( [ eqfexc ] ) and yields the rosenfeld functional for a binary additive hard sphere mixture @xcite with radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the aov limit , @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that @xmath83 if @xmath84 , and @xmath85 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the integration over @xmath86 in ( [ eqfexc ] ) together with the kernel @xmath87 and the fact that the density @xmath88 appears linearly in @xmath28 , see @xmath89 in ( [ eqcoefficienta01 ] ) , plays the same role that building weighted densities for the polymer species in the aov case does . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting functional is equal to that for the aov model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the wr limit , in contrast to @xcite , terms higher than on the second virial level vanish . for @xmath90 </S>",
    "<S> the two species decouple , and @xmath91={\\cal f}_{\\rm exc}[\\rho_1]+ { \\cal f}_{\\rm exc}[\\rho_2]$ ] which is _ not _ obeyed by the present approximation , limiting its applicability to small values of @xmath92 .    </S>",
    "<S> we next turn to an investigation of bulk properties of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> to assess structure , direct correlation functions can be obtained via @xmath93 which can be shown to feature percus - yevick ( py ) like behavior : @xmath94 . inverting the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) relations </S>",
    "<S> permits to calculate partial structure factors , @xmath95 , and partial pair correlation functions , @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out monte carlo ( mc ) computer simulations in the canonical ensemble with 1024 particles and @xmath97 mc moves per particle ; histograms of all distances between particles yield benchmark results for @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen an intermediate size ratio of @xmath98 and have considered various values of @xmath8 from @xmath99 to 0.5 and a range of statepoints characterized by packing fractions , @xmath100 for @xmath25 . for @xmath101 , </S>",
    "<S> the current dft reproduces the solution of the py integral equation , as the functional reduces to the rosenfeld case , which is known to yield the same @xmath102 as the py approximation . </S>",
    "<S> results for the representative case @xmath103 at two different statepoints are shown in figure [ figgofr ] . </S>",
    "<S> the core condition , @xmath104 , is only approximately fulfilled , but the overall agreement between results from theory and simulation is quite remarkable .    , between species @xmath12 and 22 ( as indicated ) , as a function of the scaled distance @xmath105 , as obtained from the present dft using the oz route ( dashed lines ) and from mc simulation ( solid lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> results for @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) are shifted upwards by one ( two ) units for clarity . </S>",
    "<S> parameters are @xmath98 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( lower ) , 0.1 ( upper ) . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical critical point is located at @xmath111 . ]    in principle one could envisage that this approach permits to study the depletion potential , @xmath112 , between particles of species 1 being generated by the immersion into a `` sea '' of particles 2 through @xmath113 for @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the ( relevant ) case of small size ratios ( e.g.  @xmath116 , see @xcite ) already in both limits of additive hard spheres and the aov model the results are only of rather moderate accuracy , underestimating the strength of the depletion attraction @xcite , similar to results from the py approximation </S>",
    "<S> . however , results from the present theory obtained through the oz route ( not shown ) cross over smoothly between the additive hard sphere case and the aov case , similar to the correct behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence one can conclude that the pair structure predicted by the current dft is similar to that of the py approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this is a remarkable property , and one can anticipate test - particle calculations to yield superior results .    evaluating ( [ eqfexc ] ) at constant density fields yields an analytic expression for the bulk excess free energy for fluid states , @xmath117 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the total helmholtz free energy is then @xmath118 $ ] , where @xmath119 is the ( irrelevant ) de broglie wavelength of species @xmath0 , and @xmath120 is the system volume . via taylor expanding @xmath121 in both densities one can show that it features the exact second virial coefficients ( consistent with the correct incorporation of @xmath122 on the second virial level ) and also the exact third virial coefficients ( see e.g.  @xcite ) provided @xmath123 .    </S>",
    "<S> the fluid - fluid demixing spinodal can be obtained from ( numerical ) solution of @xmath124 , and the location of the critical point can be determined from minimizing one of the chemical potentials , @xmath125 or @xmath126 , along the spinodal . </S>",
    "<S> such results are compared in figure [ figcrit ] to those from simulations for @xmath127 , performed in the semi - grand ensemble by jagannathan and yethiraj @xcite and by gd  @xcite , the latter study including a finite size analysis , for a variety of non - additivities ranging from @xmath128 . for the highly asymmetric case of @xmath129 results from gibbs ensemble simulations </S>",
    "<S> were obtained by dijkstra @xcite . for </S>",
    "<S> both size ratios the strong decrease of the total critical packing fraction with increasing values of @xmath8 , as well as the overall functional dependence are very well described by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , the precise value at given @xmath8 is underestimated . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is not uncommon for mean - field like theories and is also present in the aov case .    , where @xmath130 , for a non - additive binary hard sphere mixture as a function of the non - additivity parameter @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> shown are results from the present dft ( lines ) and from simulations ( symbols ) for the symmetric case , @xmath131 , by gd  @xcite ( filled squares ) and by jagannathan and yethiraj @xcite ( open circles ) , as well as for the highly asymmetric case of @xmath132 by dijkstra @xcite ( crosses ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> a benefit of working on the level of the density functional is that the structure is consistent with the free energy . in figure [ figsij ] </S>",
    "<S> partial structure factors are shown for a range of values of @xmath8 evaluated at the fluid - fluid critical point obtained from the free energy , and indeed @xmath133 .     for @xmath134 ( as indicated ) , as a function of @xmath135 at the fluid - fluid critical point for size ratio @xmath132 and non - additivity @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> the results for @xmath137 ( 1 ) are shifted upwards by 5 ( 10 ) units for clarity . ]    in conclusion , having demonstrated the good accuracy of the predictions of the current theory for bulk fluid properties of the non - additive hard sphere mixture , we are confident that it is well suited to study interesting and relevant interfacial situations , like the structure and tension of interfaces between demixed phases , wetting at substrates @xcite and more . </S>",
    "<S> note that any colloidal mixtures interacting with soft repulsive forces , as e.g.present in charge - stabilized dispersions , can be mapped ( e.g.  by the barker - henderson procedure ) onto an effective non - additive hard sphere system . </S>",
