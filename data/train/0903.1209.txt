    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite have shown that cs also depletes out in the central parts of dense cores , suggesting that cs ( so far considered a high density tracer ) does not actually probe the central core regions .",
    "on the other hand , n@xmath3h@xmath0 is an excellent tracer of dust continuum emission @xcite , implying that this species does not deplete out ( due to the volatility of the parent species n@xmath3 ) .    in more massive cores , depletion is probably active in dense regions away from star forming sites where dust temperatures may be low enough ( @xmath9 k ) for co and cs abundances to drop and cause chemical differentiation @xcite .",

    "an inspection of the observational results and estimates of the physical parameters presented above leads to several important conclusions :    \\(1 ) there are strong variations of the relative intensities in the lines of different molecular tracers across the investigated high mass star forming regions .",
    "in paper  i we mentioned already striking differences between n@xmath3h@xmath0 and cs maps and the fact that the cs distribution follows that of the dust emission while n@xmath3h@xmath0 does not .",
    "now we see that c@xmath1o and hcn , like cs , are good tracers of the dust emission which presumably shows the total mass distribution . at the same time",
    "the behavior of hco@xmath0 and hnc resembles that of n@xmath3h@xmath0 .",
    "significant differences in distributions of various species in particular sources have been noticed in some other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but here we see systematic effects common for the sources in the sample .",

    "they are practically constant within each source and among the whole sample ( with small deviations which can be caused e.g. by temperature uncertainties ) and are close to the `` canonical '' values derived earlier ( e.g. @xmath67 obtained by @xcite ) .",

    "our estimates are plotted by the filled symbols .",
    "the open symbols correspond to the data presented by @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    these correlations should not be affected much by the uncertainties in the abundances due to the lte approximation , given that both variables scale in a similar way if the non - lte approach is adopted .",
    "\\(4 ) the derived ionization fraction in these objects in general increases towards the strong embedded ir sources which coincide with the main peaks of the dust and cs emission ( by a factor of 2@xmath423 ) .",
    "the n@xmath3h@xmath0 , hco@xmath0 and hnc abundances decrease correspondingly in these areas .",
    "this is consistent with our results in paper  i where we found that the n@xmath3h@xmath0 abundance is systematically lower towards the cs / dust emission peaks which coincide with strong ir sources .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that estimates of the electron abundance were performed under the assumption of a constant gas density .",
    "our estimates of the gas density towards s255 ir and",
    "n give practically the same values . at the same time it is not unreasonable to expect density variations which can smooth the derived variations of the ionization fraction .",
    "it is worth noting that these variations of the ionization fraction refer to the values averaged over the line of sight and an increase of the electron abundance in vicinities of a young star can be significantly larger .",
    "@xcite found similar variations of molecular abundances in the orion molecular cloud and suggested that the abundances of molecular ions can be reduced by a higher electron abundance caused by uv radiation propagating in a clumpy photodissociation region .",
    "it is well known that in clumpy media uv photons can penetrate deep into dense clouds leading to significantly enhanced ionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the same time in their study of the ionization fraction in massive cores",
    ", @xcite did not find any noticeable increase of the electron abundance from the edge to the centre of massive cores .",
    "this can be caused perhaps by insufficient luminosities of their sample sources .",
    "thus , we believe that uv radiation from young massive stars in clumpy media can be the primary cause of the observed ionization enhancement .",
    "in addition , x - rays detected already from many massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be also responsible for this effect .",
    "\\(5 ) we see no dependence of the relative abundances on the velocity dispersion , as derived from the observed line widths . in principle",
    "such dependence could be expected in particular for n@xmath3h@xmath0 if it really escapes perturbed regions as suggested e.g. by @xcite .",
    "\\(6 ) there may be a trend for decreasing n@xmath3h@xmath0 and increasing h@xmath74cn abundances with increasing temperature .",
    "however , this is based on only one point ( w3 data ) and can not be considered reliable .",
    "apparently the observed differences in molecular distributions can not be explained by molecular freeze - out as in low - mass cores .",
    "the kinetic ( and dust ) temperatures at the cs and n@xmath3h@xmath0 peaks are similar in most cases and rather high , @xmath75  k , which probably makes freeze - out ineffective . this is confirmed by the absence of any indication of the co and cs depletion as mentioned above .",
    "one possible explanation for the observed chemical differentiations was proposed by @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the enhancement of cs and reduction in @xmath76 abundance found in regions of high - mass star formation may be related to the high dynamical activity in these regions which could enhance the rate of collapse of cores above the free - fall rate .",
    "consequently , high gas densities would be achieved before freeze - out had removed the molecules responsible for @xmath76 loss , while the high densities promote cs formation .",
    "however , this model has several drawbacks .",
    "in particular , its predictions for some species ( e.g. so ) are not supported by observations .",
    "then , it predicts a decrease in the abundance accompanied by cs enhancement .",
    "our data show no sign of the cs abundance variations .",
    "nothing to say that an accelerated collapse itself has no more or less advanced physical basement .",
    "our results presented in the previous section indicate that ionization fraction is probably more important in establishing the steady - state n@xmath3h@xmath0 and hnc abundance in massive cores .",
    "the only important process which forms n@xmath3h@xmath0 is ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath77    there are two main processes which destroy n@xmath3h@xmath0 : the reaction with the co molecule @xmath78 and dissociative recombination @xmath79 which mainly lead to the formation of n@xmath3 ( 90% of the total reaction ) , as recently found by @xcite .",
    "then , we have to take into account n@xmath3h@xmath0 recombination onto negatively charged dust grains as in the case of hco@xmath0 .",
    "the steady state n@xmath3h@xmath0 abundance in this model will be given by the formula : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the rate of the reaction ( [ eq : n2h+ ] ) , @xmath82 is the rate of the reaction ( [ eq : n2h+-co ] ) which is @xmath83  @xmath62s@xmath52 according to the umist database and @xmath84 is the summary rate of the reactions ( [ eq : n2h+-e1 ] ) , ( [ eq : n2h+-e2 ] ) .",
    "its value is significantly different in the umist and osu databases .",
    "we accept the value of @xmath85  @xmath62s@xmath52 at 30  k ( e.  herbst , private communication ) .",
    "this means that the dissociative recombination will dominate at @xmath86 , i.e. at @xmath87 for the standard co abundance @xmath88 .",
    "this is close to an average electron abundances derived in this work .",
    "therefore , in principle it is possible that the dissociative recombination of n@xmath3h@xmath0 can dominate at least in part of our objects .",
    "then , if the h@xmath44 and n@xmath3 abundances are more or less constant ( as can be expected ) we obtain for @xmath72 the dependence on @xmath65 similar to that presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : xe - abund ] .",
    "it is less clear how to explain the behavior of the hcn and hnc abundances .",
    "their formation pathways are very different .",
    "hcn definitely forms from the neutral - neutral processes @xcite @xmath89 hnc forms via the distinctly independent sequence @xmath90    the main destruction processes for hnc are probably reactions with c@xmath0 and h@xmath44 @xcite .",
    "calculations of steady state abundances of these species require additional chemical modeling .",
    "we note that the hnc formation is closely linked to nh@xmath4 . given that nh@xmath4 and n@xmath3h@xmath0 both form from n@xmath3 , thus they are chemically related , one expects similar morphologies of hnc and n@xmath3h@xmath0 , as in fact we observe .",
    "one of the most intriguing problems in studies of high mass star formation is the identification of massive protostars at the earliest phases of evolution .",
    "some clumps from our sample represent probably such protostellar objects .",
    "for example the se clump in w3 area is associated with a water maser but has no embedded ir sources and/or uc h  ii regions .",
    "the hco@xmath0 line profile shows a red - shifted self - absorption feature typical for a collapsing cloud .",
    "the mass of this clump from continuum data is about 70  m@xmath91 ( table  [ table : mass ] ) .",
    "therefore , it can be a massive protostar on a rather early evolutionary stage .",
    "it is also very pronounced in n@xmath3h@xmath0 emission .",
    "another example of this kind is the n@xmath3h@xmath0 emission peak in s187 ( although we did not see signs of contraction on the line profiles ) . in the s255 area , the northern component which is dominant in n@xmath3h@xmath0 ,",
    "is apparently much younger than s255 ir .",
    "these examples show that a relatively strong n@xmath3h@xmath0 emission can be considered as an indicator of such objects .",
    "the species which correlate with n@xmath3h@xmath0 ( hco@xmath0 and hnc ) can be also useful in this respect .",
    "we presented and discussed here observations of five regions of active high mass star formation in various molecular lines ( at 3 mm and at 1.3 mm ) and in continuum at 1.3 mm .",
    "on the basis of these observations we estimated physical parameters of the sources and molecular abundances .",
    "the main results of this study can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the typical physical parameters for the sources in our sample are : kinetic temperature in the range @xmath5  k , masses from tens to hundreds solar masses , gas densities @xmath6  @xmath7 , ionization fraction @xmath8 . in most cases",
    "the ionization fraction slightly ( a few times ) increases towards the embedded ysos .",
    "the observed clumps are close to gravitational equilibrium .",
    "our temperature estimates are systematically lower ( by a factor of about 1.52 ) compared to those obtained with nh@xmath4 observations .",
    "however , temperatures measured with ch@xmath4c@xmath3h are similar to dust temperatures , suggesting that the observed methyl acetylene transitions better trace the dust than ammonia ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines . 2 .",
    "there are systematic differences in distributions of various molecules in regions of high mass star formation .",

    "<S> . then we analyze correlations between molecular abundances and physical parameters and discuss chemical models applicable to these species.the typical physical parameters for the sources in our sample are the following : kinetic temperature in the range @xmath5  k ( it is systematically higher than that obtained from ammonia observations and is rather close to dust temperature ) , masses from tens to hundreds solar masses , gas densities @xmath6  @xmath7 , ionization fraction @xmath8 . in most cases </S>",
