    "the degree of a vertex @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath8 , is the number of edges incident to @xmath9 .",
    "then the _ atom - bond connectivity ( abc ) index _ of @xmath4 is defined as @xmath10 this degree - based molecular structure descriptor was introduced in 1998 by estrada , torres , rodr ' iguez and gutman  @xcite , who showed that it can be a valuable predictive tool in the study of the heat of formation in alkanes .",
    "later the physico - chemical applicability of the abc index was confirmed and extended in several studies  @xcite .",
    "in addition , some comparative studies reported results that favour the abc index over other mathematically similar molecular structure descriptors  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the mathematical properties of the abc index were studied with increasing interest over the last several years .",
    "more results about the mathematical and computational aspect of the abc index can be found in  @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "several natural extensions and variants of the abc index were introduced with a hope to obtain other successful molecular structure descriptors .",
    "thus , in @xmath1 , graovac and ghorbani  @xcite proposed the following distance - based analog of the abc index : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is defined as the number of vertices of @xmath4 lying closer to @xmath13 than to @xmath9 and similarly @xmath14 as the number of vertices of @xmath4 lying closer to @xmath9 than to @xmath13 , namely @xmath15 here @xmath16 denotes the distance between vertices @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. , the number of edges on the shortest path connecting @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this index was named after its authors as the _ graovac - ghorbani index_. since it resembles the abc index , it is also known as the _ second atom - bond connectivity index _ and is often denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "however , as it was indicated in  @xcite , this name and notation are inappropriate since the expression @xmath20 is not related to atom connectivity ( as the degree of a vertex ) and bond connectivity ( as the degree of a bond / edge ) .",
    "therefore , we refer to this index as the graovac - ghorbani index and denote it by @xmath2 .",
    "some initial studies indicate that the graovac - ghorbani index could be an effective predictive tool in chemistry .",
    "for instance , it can be used to model both the boiling and the melting points of molecules  @xcite .    due to its recentness",
    ", the graovac - ghorbani index was studied only to a limited extent . in",
    "@xcite maximal unicyclic graphs with respect to the @xmath2 index were determined .",
    "some upper bounds on the @xmath2 index were presented in  @xcite .",
    "this work was extended in  @xcite , where lower and additional upper bounds for the @xmath2 index of graphs were given .",
    "the authors also determined the trees with minimal and maximal @xmath2 indices . throughout the paper",
    ", we will need the result about trees with minimal @xmath2 indices .",
    "for later reference , we state it explicitly .    [ thm : path - mingg_trees ] the path @xmath21 is the @xmath22-vertex tree with the minimum graovac - ghorbani index .",
    "further upper and lower bounds on the @xmath2 index were presented in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 indices of several special chemical molecular structures including the unilateral polyomino chain , the unilateral hexagonal chain , the v - phenylenic nanotubes and the nanotori were presented in  @xcite .",
    "recently , in  @xcite , the structure of graphs with maximal @xmath2 was conjectured based on computational results .",
    "the relation between the @xmath2 index and the original abc index was also investigated very recently in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in  @xcite , some physico - chemical properties of the @xmath2 index were compared with the physico - chemical properties of a few other well - known distance - based molecular descriptors , and the obtained results suggest that it might be worth investigating the @xmath2 index further .    to simplify the derivation of the results presented in the paper",
    ", we find it useful to introduce the notion of a _",
    "normalized graovac - ghorbani index_. we denote it by @xmath3 , and define it as @xmath23 this measure is of purely technical importance to us .",
    "the graovac - ghorbani index @xmath2 can be expressed very conveniently using @xmath3 when dealing with bipartite graphs .",
    "[ prop : ngg_bprt ] let @xmath4 be a bipartite graph on @xmath22 vertices",
    ". then @xmath24    following the definition of @xmath12 and @xmath14 in  , one can conclude that in the case of a bipartite graph , @xmath25 holds for any edge @xmath26 of @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , assume that this does not hold , i.e. , assume that @xmath27 for some edge @xmath28",
    ". then there exists a vertex @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and therefore @xmath4 contains an odd cycle , which in turn is a contradiction to the fact that @xmath4 is a bipartite graph .",
    "hence , the desired equality holds : @xmath31    notice that proposition  [ prop : ngg_bprt ] implies that in any subclass of bipartite graphs of fixed order @xmath22 , the extremal graphs for the @xmath3 index and the extremal graphs for the @xmath2 index are the same .",
    "in the rest of the paper , we first consider the @xmath2 index of very long paths in section  [ sec : paths ] . in section  [ sec : bipartite - graphs ] , we present all bipartite graphs with minimal and maximal @xmath2 indices .",
    "we conclude and state some open problems in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "it is well - known that , in general , the graph with @xmath22 vertices that minimizes the graovac - ghorbani index is the complete graph @xmath32  @xcite . from a chemical point of view , it is also interesting to confine oneself to studying trees . by theorem  [ thm : path - mingg_trees ] ,",
    "a path is a tree with minimal @xmath2 index . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a star graph is a tree with maximal @xmath2 index .",
    "nevertheless , graphs with a lower maximum degree tend to be more relevant to applications in chemistry as the maximum degree of a _ molecular graph _ , that is , a topological representation of a ( typically organic ) molecule , never exceeds four .    for this reason",
    ", we spend some time examining paths . in the limit ,",
    "as the length of the path tends to infinity , a nice and simple result follows .    for the path @xmath21 on @xmath22 vertices ,",
    "the ensuing relation holds : @xmath33    let us sketch why the statement is true .",
    "we have that @xmath34 observe that the latter form of the sum can serve as an approximation of the area bounded by the curves @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the @xmath38-axis .",
    "evidently , the greater the @xmath22 , the more precise the approximation is .",
    "the result now follows from the existence of the improper integral @xmath39 , which is known to be equal to @xmath40 .    from the result above",
    ", one can easily estimate the value of @xmath41 for large @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath21 be a path on @xmath22 vertices .",
    "it holds that @xmath42",
    "we will now move on to the graovac - ghorbani index of more general bipartite graphs and provide some results concerning extremal problems . more specifically",
    ", we will identify all bipartite graphs with maximal and minimal @xmath2 indices .",
    "[ thm : bipartite_max ] amongst all bipartite graphs on @xmath22 vertices , the maximum ( normalized ) graovac - ghorbani index is uniquely attained by the complete bipartite graph @xmath43 .",

    "let us investigate the square of the normalized graovac - ghorbani index and find an upper bound for it .",
    "note that , by the cauchy - schwarz inequality , @xmath51 where we assume @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , observe that for each edge @xmath28 , inequalities @xmath52 and @xmath53 have to be fulfilled as the set of vertices lying closer to either of the vertices ( in comparison to the other vertex ) has to contain at least the vertex itself and all its immediate neighbours except for @xmath9 ( resp .",
    "@xmath13 ) .",
    "the latter is an evident consequence of the bipartiteness of @xmath4 .",
    "hence , @xmath54 the last equality follows from the fact that each vertex @xmath49 contributes exactly one to the first sum and similarly each vertex @xmath50 contributes one to the second sum .    under the constraint that @xmath55 , the product @xmath56 attains its maximum when @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "notice that @xmath59 when @xmath22 is even .",
    "thus , the maximum of @xmath60 and , consequently , the maximum of @xmath61 can only be achieved when @xmath4 is a complete bipartite graph @xmath43 . by proposition  [ prop : ngg_bprt ] ,",
    "the same result follows for the @xmath2 index .    as an immediate consequence of theorem  [ thm : bipartite_max ] , we have the following corollary .",

    "both values are achieved if and only if @xmath4 is the complete bipartite graph @xmath43 .",
    "a natural problem that arises from the abovementioned theorem is the characterization of bipartite graphs that minimize the @xmath2 index .    for the purpose of the next theorem , which provides an answer to the problem posed ,",
    "we introduce the notion of a _ cycle with a hook _ , that is , a graph with an odd number of vertices @xmath22 comprised of two even cycles @xmath63 and @xmath64 which share three common vertices and two common edges , and write @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , we denote by @xmath66 a _ cycle with a pendant edge _ , that is , an unicyclic graph with an odd number of vertices @xmath22 comprised of a cycle @xmath63 and a pendant vertex .",

    "the cyclomatic number @xmath67 can be expressed as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the number of connected components of @xmath4 .",

    "furthermore , these are the unique graphs with the respective properties",
    ".    let @xmath4 denote a bipartite graph on @xmath22 vertices that minimizes the @xmath2 index .",

    "the calculations of the normalized indices of the cycle @xmath72 , the cycle with a pendant edge @xmath66 , and the cycle with a hook @xmath65 are straightforward , hence we omit them .",
    "we will show that the minimum value of the normalized index in the class of all bipartite graphs indeed is attained by these three graphs for @xmath71 and by @xmath21 for @xmath75 . according to the parity of @xmath22",

    "consequently , @xmath84 , where equality holds whenever @xmath85 and @xmath86 for all @xmath28 .",
    "the first condition amounts to @xmath4 being unicyclic whilst the second one forces @xmath4 to be precisely the cycle @xmath72 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath4 would contain a leaf @xmath87 .",
    "evidently , @xmath88 holds for the vertex @xmath13 that shares a common edge with a leaf @xmath29 .",

    ".    on the other hand , if @xmath4 is a tree , it has to be a path @xmath21 on @xmath22 vertices by theorem  [ thm : path - mingg_trees ] .",

    "_ hence , it contains a cycle .",
    "first of all , we will devote our attention to @xmath4 being unicyclic .",
    "clearly , its set of leaves has to be non - empty as the cycle @xmath72 on @xmath101 vertices fails to be bipartite .",
    "let @xmath29 be a leaf of @xmath4 . as already discussed in the previous case , @xmath103 for every edge @xmath104 with a leaf @xmath29 as one of its endpoints .",
    "moreover , @xmath105 for every ( other ) edge @xmath28 .",
    "thus , @xmath106 as a result , the cycle with a pendant edge @xmath66 has the lowest normalized @xmath2 index in the class of unicyclic bipartite graphs .",
    "indeed , all other graphs in the same class contain a pendant path of length at least two ( and hence an edge that contributes @xmath107 , which in this case is strictly greater than @xmath108 ) or at least two leaves , and thus have a higher normalized @xmath2 index .",
    "notice that the order of @xmath66 is at least @xmath109 .",
    "let us now focus on graphs which may contain more than one cycle",
    ". if @xmath4 is not unicyclic , @xmath110 and so @xmath111 .",
    "we need to verify that @xmath65 is the only graph that attains this lower bound .",
    "observe that any alternative graph @xmath4 which fulfills this condition has the following properties : it has precisely @xmath112 edges and none of its vertices is a leaf as @xmath113 for @xmath114 ( the case @xmath115 is not of our interest as it corresponds to an odd cycle , which is not a bipartite graph ) .",
    "thus , @xmath116 for each @xmath7 . since @xmath4 has @xmath117 vertices , @xmath112 edges and one connected component , its cyclomatic number is @xmath78 .",

    "indeed , observe that both cycles @xmath155 and @xmath156 must be of even order , otherwise the graph is not bipartite .",
    "consequently , because @xmath4 is of odd order , the path @xmath157 must be of odd order too .",
    "we may assume that in both configurations the order of @xmath155 is at least as large as the order of @xmath156 , i.e. , @xmath158 .",
