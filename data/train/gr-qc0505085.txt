    "interest in the problem of radiation reaction from particle motion in a curved spacetime has seen a rapid increase in recent years .",
    "the back - reaction of emitted radiation on the particle , known as the self - force , changes the particle trajectories ( e.g. , near a black hole ) from a simple geodesic motion .",
    "the determination of the self force is essential to precision calculations of particle trajectories and the determination of waveforms from prospective astrophysical sources .",
    "electromagnetic radiation reaction in a curved spacetime was first studied by dewitt and brehm @xcite .",
    "the gravitational radiation reaction equation was first obtained by mino , sasaki and tanaka @xcite and quinn and wald @xcite and others , notably detweiler and whiting @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion governing a scalar charge with radiation reaction was first obtained by quinn @xcite . for an excellent review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "parallel to this there has been detailed work devoted to particles and detectors ( e.g. , atoms ) moving in a quantum field and in design studies of possible detection of unruh radiation ( see , e.g.,@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the introduction of worldline path integral methods ( see @xcite and references therein ) enable one to obtain equations of motion for the charges and the field self - consistently . the introduction of open system concepts and the influence functional method enables one to derive stochastic equations with a noise source derived _ ab initio _ and in a self consistent manner ( see @xcite for accelerating detectors , @xcite for moving charges . )    in this paper , we use the worldline influence functional method to study a particle with a scalar charge moving in its own quantum scalar field in a curved spacetime .",
    "this is a generalization of results obtained in @xcite to curved spacetime .",
    "we are interested in the radiation it emits and its backreaction ( radiation reaction ) on the trajectory of the particle and derive the equations of motion for the quantum average ( expectation value ) of the particle s position . for those particle trajectory histories which become sufficiently decohered , the expectation value behaves classically .",
    "the scalar ald equation we derive in this limit checks with the result of quinn @xcite .",
    "we then include in our consideration the effect of fluctuations in the quantum field .",
    "we show how it behaves like a classical stochastic force and derive a scalar ald - langevin equation for the particle dynamics with a stochastic component , thus capturing the induced small fluctuations on the particle trajectory",
    ". this equation will be useful for the study of stochastic motion of charges under the influence of both quantum or classical noise sources , derived either self - consistently ( as done here ) or put in by hand ( with warnings ) . for astrophysical sources with some stochastic component this effect may need to be included in more accurate calculations of waveform templates .    in sec .",

    "7 we summarize our findings and appendices a - d provide further details in the derivation of certain results given in the text .",
    "the open quantum system paradigm starts by considering a system , or universe , which is partitioned ( according to natural physical arguments or some large scale separation ) into two smaller systems .",
    "one subsystem , called the _ system _ , is assumed to be the one of interest and the other , called the _ environment _ , contains many more degrees of freedom .",
    "an accurate description of the behavior of the system variables requires knowing the influence from the environment due to their mutual interactions .",
    "a less than accurate description of the overall influence of the environment can be obtained by introducing some coarse - graining over the environmental variables .      in a coordinate system , assume at some initial time @xmath0 the quantum statistical state of the combined system s ( particle in position @xmath1 ) and environment e ( quantum field @xmath2 ) is described by a density matrix @xmath3 . in practice ,",

    "it is customary to choose the initial density matrix to correspond to a factorized state of the system and environment .",
    "physically , this means that all of the field modes have been uncorrelated with the particle by an instantaneous measurement at time @xmath0 . aside from issues about performing this measurement simultaneously in the spacetime , this choice is somewhat unphysical because , as explained in @xcite , an infinite amount of energy is required to uncorrelate all the modes of the environment ( field ) from the system ( particle ) at a particular instant of time .",
    "for instance , in models of quantum brownian motion with an infinite number of environment oscillators the factorized initial state results in large transients of the diffusion coefficients appearing in the master equation for the reduced density matrix @xcite .",
    "the transients appear as a result of the high frequency modes of the environment beginning to interact and correlate with the system just after the initial time .",

    "doing this reveals a term like ( [ drift ] ) but this requires a much more careful analysis that goes beyond the stochastic semi - classical approximation adopted here .",
    "the previous sections focused on the feynman - vernon formalism and various approximations to obtain the low - energy effective dynamics of the particle , both for its semiclassical ( mean ) and stochastic semi - classical ( mean and stochastic fluctuations ) motion . here , the domain of validity of the quasi - local expansion and this semi - classical treatment will be explored and compared with the relevant scales for weak and strong radiation damping .    in the effective field theory paradigm a regulator @xmath136 is introduced for controlling the ultraviolet divergences appearing in the direct part of the retarded green s function such that @xmath142 with @xmath143 small and approaching zero . after expanding @xmath143 near the coincidence limit",
    "the time - scale of the quasi - local expansion @xmath239 is governed by @xmath240 recall that for times larger than @xmath185 the time - dependent coefficients in ( [ eff_mean_eom ] ) and ( [ stoch_ald ] ) rapidly approach constant values ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "but there are other scales to consider .",
    "we have been working at tree - level in both the particle and the field so that @xmath241 must be much larger than the scale for 1-loop field and 1-loop particle corrections .",
    "this implies that the time interval @xmath241 should be much longer than the time - scale for creating pairs @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the compton wavelength associated with the scalar particle .",
    "the dynamics ( [ eff_mean_eom ] ) and ( [ stoch_ald ] ) are therefore valid using this framework provided that @xmath244    nevertheless , the presence of the third @xmath16-derivative in ( [ eff_mean_eom ] ) , ( [ stoch_ald ] ) and ( [ particle_perts ] ) requires the specification of the initial position , velocity , and acceleration to obtain unique solutions .",
    "this is problematic , since for a vanishing external force @xmath193 one still requires an initial acceleration to solve the equations .",
    "but , if there is no force accelerating the charge then what causes the particle to accelerate ?",
    "furthermore , the particle may experience unbounded acceleration so that its kinetic energy increases with time to infinity . since scalar dynamics is an energy - conserving theory where then could this energy arise ?",
    "these problems are related to the infinite self - energy of a ( classical ) charged point particle .    in",
    "the _ classical _ theory of scalar fields and particles these issues can be resolved if one instead gives the particle a finite size @xmath245 for which the self - energy is roughly @xmath246 @xcite .",
    "if this energy composes its rest mass then @xmath247 and represents the  size \" of the particle . in @xcite , an approximation , amounting to an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath245 , called the landau approximation ( also known as order - reduction ) , is employed to obtain solutions that require only an initial position and velocity and are also free from run - away solutions .",
    "the landau approximation converts the ald equation ( of third order ) to the so - called landau - lifshitz equation ( of second order ) .",

    "the lowest order solution is found by simply ignoring the self - force so that the radiation damping is assumed weak .",

    "the self - force will be weak if @xmath250 and the length scale associated with the spacetime curvature @xmath251 is large ( i.e. small curvature ) so that @xmath252 .",
    "it then follows that for weak damping in the semi - classical domain that the quasi - local expansion and the landau approximation are valid provided that @xmath253    recently , in the context of plasma physics , @xcite has investigated the validity of the landau approximation for the classical ald equation by numerically integrating the landau - lifshitz equation forward in time and , using the final position , velocity , and acceleration from that , integrating the ald equation backward in time .",
    "if the initial position and velocity of the particle differ significantly from the backward - evolved solution of the ald equation at the initial time then one can assume the landau approximation has broken down .",

    "much smaller than @xmath243 , he finds disagreement between the solutions of the landau - lifshitz and ald equations .",
    "however , these equations can not be fully trusted since quantum effects should become important . in this domain , while we can not directly apply our results to this problem we can use the closely related closed - time - path ( ctp ) formalism to incorporate the effects of the quantum loop corrections to the ( quantum ) particle dynamics .",
    "this brings us to an important issue , namely , how strongly must the particle worldline decohere in order for a stochastic semi - classical treatment to be applicable ?",
    "a measure of the decoherence of a system is the _ decoherence functional _",
    "@xcite @xmath257 $ ] where @xmath258 specifies a particular coarse - grained history of the worldline .",
    "if we take the history to be @xmath259 then the decoherence functional is @xmath260 & = & d[z , z^\\prime ] \\\\          & = & \\rho_s ( z_i , z_i ^\\prime ) \\ , e^ { \\frac { i}{\\hbar } s_{cgea } [ z , z^\\prime ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and is closely related to the ctp effective action @xcite .",
    "in fact , the norm of @xmath261 is proportional to the norm of the influence functional .",
    "the system is said to decohere if @xmath262 approaches zero .",
    "we showed earlier that the cgea is proportional to @xmath263 and so there is minimal decoherence for two nearby histories .",
    "this implies that coarse - graining the quantum field must be complemented by an additional coarse - graining of the worldline in order for the particle to be sufficiently decohered .",
    "if the mechanism for decoherence is efficient then this additional coarse - graining should be minimal and the stochastic semi - classical description that we have used in this paper is applicable . for our problem , recall that the cgea contains an imaginiary part that is proportional to @xmath264 so that the norm of @xmath261 is @xmath265 | & = & e^ { - \\frac{1}{4\\hbar } j^- \\cdot ( 16 \\pi^2 g_h ) \\cdot j^-}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] showing that the quantum field fluctuations in the environment is the mechanism for decoherence .",
    "it is therefore necessary to understand the behavior of the hadamard function to show that there exists a well - defined stochastic semi - classical regime for the particle .",
    "this requires knowing the field modes on the background space - time , which is a significant problem in its own right . for simple scenarios the decoherence functional",
    "can be calculated and the decoherence time approximated .",
    "but , in general , one needs to determine if decoherence is fast enough on a case by case basis .      towards the end of sec .",
    "5 we replaced the classical stochastic manifestation of the quantum fluctuations by a noise source @xmath231 that has some specified noise correlator . aside from the issue about keeping only to tree - level in the particle and field variables , how is using @xmath231 different from all of the sophisticated machinery used in the previous sections ?    unlike in our approach , inserting a source of noise by hand implies that it can have any correlator one wants .",
    "the stochastic two - point function of @xmath229 @xmath266 otherwise known as the noise kernel , can be chosen at will .",
    "some physical reasoning , for instance , a high temperature environment , might suggest that @xmath267 , i.e. white noise . while white noise certainly simplifies the calculations ,",
    "there is little justification for simply stating the form of the noise kernel and expecting the dynamics of the system to be consistent with that source . using the feynman - vernon formalism",

    "this is an important statement that can not be overstated because it is this feature which gives rise to consistent fluctuation - dissipation relations ( fdr ) . inserting noise by hand",
    "most likely violates such a relation .",
    "while fdr s wo nt be discussed here in great detail , @xcite have studied the fdr s for @xmath269 particles interacting with a quantum field for certain trajectories ( e.g. uniformly accelerated ) .",
    "they have shown the existence and self - consistency of these relations and further introduce correlation - propagation relations relating the correlations of particles to each other through the ( causal ) propagation of the quantum field .",
    "these correlation - propagation relations can only be formed if the particles interact directly through causal influences .",
    "the open quantum system viewpoint , therefore , shows the interrelated influences of the system and environment through these types of self - consistent relations .",
    "this is an important feature lacking in a model that has noise put in by hand .",
    "another problem with adding noise in by hand is that the noise can be a significant contribution to the quantum two - point function of the system if one is interested in the quantum particle behavior .",
    "so , having the correct form for the noise kernel is important for getting the correct expression for the quantum two - point functions .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite , using the ctp generating functional for quantum correlation functions of the system variables , for quantum brownian motion as well as for stochastic semi - classical gravity ( see next section ) , that certain quantum two - point functions are related to stochastic two - point functions .",
    "as an example , the symmetrized quantum two - point function of a brownian particle s position can be written as @xmath270 where @xmath271 is a solution of the qbm langevin equation @xmath272 for the appropriate linear operator @xmath273 , and @xmath274 denotes the average over all possible initial positions and momenta with respect to the reduced wigner function for the initial state of the particle .",
    "the solutions of the qbm langevin equation consist of a homogeneous part , containing all the information about the initial conditions of the system , and a term describing effects due to the interactions between the particle and oscillators .",
    "@xmath275    the symmetrized quantum two - point function becomes @xmath276    where @xmath277 is the noise kernel , given by the stochastic correlator of @xmath80 .",
    "the first term involving the homogeneous solution of the langevin equation represents the dispersion in the initial conditions and is called the _",
    "intrinsic fluctuations_. the second term involving the noise kernel , and hence the quantum fluctuations of the environment , represents the correlations with the environment through the stochastic fluctuations and is called the _ induced fluctuations_. it turns out that if the homogeneous solution @xmath278 decays exponentially fast then for late times , at least times larger than the decay time , the quantum two - point function is determined entirely by the noise kernel , that is , the induced fluctuations . and so , in this sense , all of the information about the quantum correlations of the system degrees of freedom is encoded in the stochastic correlations .",
    "this shows another drawback to putting noise in by hand .",
    "the induced fluctuations contain information about the quantum fluctuations of the system variables . but this will not be true with some arbitrary noise kernel chosen at will .      the features of the particle dynamics seen in the above discussions are typical of nonequilibrium open quantum systems .",
    "history - dependent behavior is present in the equations of motion for the system and if a renormalization procedure is required it is usually a time - dependent prescription , as seen earlier with the renormalized mass @xmath279 .",
    "furthermore , the noise correlator ( [ noise_corr ] ) is generically non - local in time and is determined by the quantum fluctuations of the environment variables .",
    "this formalism does not allow for arbitrary noise kernels since this would destroy the self - consistency between the system and environment evolution .",
    "a particular example that contains these features is stochastic semiclassical gravity , which we will briefly describe and compare with below .",
    "stochastic semiclassical gravity ( ssg ) is a self - consistent theory of the stochastic dynamics of a classical spacetime containing quantum matter fields .",
    "ssg goes beyond semiclassical gravity , for which the geometry is driven by the expectation of the ( renormalized ) stress tensor , in that the quantum field fluctuations also contribute to the spacetime dynamics through a classical stochastic source .",
    "the spacetime is therefore driven by both the quantum expectation value of the renormalized stress tensor and a classical stochastic stress - tensor - like object , @xmath280 . for an introduction and review of this subject see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of the domain of validity of ssg .    as an open quantum system ,",
    "the quantum field fluctuations are coarse - grained using the ctp formalism of schwinger and keldysh ( sk ) to study the self - consistent evolution of the ( classical ) geometry . the quantum fluctuations manifest themselves as stochastic noise thereby imparting a stochastic nature to the spacetime .",
    "the resulting einstein - langevin equation for the linearized metric perturubations @xmath281 is @xmath282 = \\kappa \\ , \\big\\langle \\ , \\hat{t}_{ab } ^{(1 ) } [ g+h ] \\",

    "it should be noted that the finite parts of the counterterms needed to cancel the divergences coming from the stress tensor expectation value have been absorbed into the definition of @xmath284 .",
    "the renormalized stress tensor expectation value ( evaluated in a gaussian state ) contains an integration over the past history of the metric fluctuations and so the dynamics is generally non - markovian .",
    "this is like what is seen in the ald - langevin equation ( [ stoch_ald ] ) where the tail term @xmath285 is analogous to the expectation value of the renormalized stress tensor in ( [ einlang ] ) .",
    "the ( covariantly conserved ) stochastic source tensor @xmath280 has zero mean and its correlator is given in terms of the hadamard function of the stress tensor fluctuations @xmath286 @xmath287 , \\xi_{cd } ( x^\\prime ; g ] \\ } \\big\\rangle _ \\xi = \\hbar \\ , \\big\\langle \\",

    "this reflects the fact that the quantum field correlations are themselves non - local .",
    "compare this with the correlator in ( [ xi_correlator ] ) which is also non - local .",
    "ssg also suffers from runaway solutions since the finite contributions to the counterterms needed to cancel the divergences appearing from the expectation value of the stress tensor are quadratic in the curvature .",
    "this makes ssg a theory with derivatives higher than two , similar to the ald type equations derived above , which were of third order in the @xmath16 derivatives .",
    "a version of the landau approximation can be used to reduce the order of the einstein - langevin equation to two thereby yielding well - behaved solutions free of the pathologies typical of higher - order derivative theories .",
    "of course , one needs to be careful to use the landau approximation at scales that are consistent with the derivation of the einstein - langevin equation .",
    "finally , the symmetrized quantum two - point functions of the metric fluctuations @xmath281 can be written in terms of intrinsic fluctuations , representing the dispersion in the initial conditions , and induced fluctuations , encoding the information about the fluctuations of the quantum matter @xcite .",
    "just like with the particle motion , one can not simply use any noise kernel for modeling stochastic metric fluctuations .",
    "one needs to do a careful analysis that ensures the self - consistency of the metric and quantum matter dynamics and the existence of fluctuation - dissipation relations .",
    "in this paper we have derived the scalar ald equation for the quantum expectation value of the worldline for a scalar charged point particle interacting with its own quantum field as it moves in a curved spacetime .",
    "our equation ( [ ren_mean_eom ] ) for the low - energy effective particle dynamics agrees with the results obtained earlier by @xcite .",
    "if the quantum fluctuations in the field strongly decohere the worldline then we can ignore the particle s quantum fluctuations and obtain the semi - classical motion ( [ ren_mean_eom ] ) .",
    "invoking an effective field theory point of view , the singular behavior of the field s retarded green s function can be regulated .",
    "for sufficiently short times @xmath288 but still long enough @xmath289 compared with the inverse cutoff frequency @xmath136 a quasi - local expansion can be used to obtain the contributions relevant to the self - force and those that are irrelevant in the infinite @xmath136 limit .",
    "this renormalizes the mass of the particle and shows explicitly the appearance of the expected @xmath290 term that is characteristic of radiation reaction .",
    "while the time - dependent coefficients ( [ h])-([aone ] ) appearing in ( [ eff_mean_eom ] ) seem to suggest that only the initial position and velocity of the particle are needed , and hence that a resolution of the problems of pre - acceleration and run - away solutions has been reached , one should keep in mind that the quasi - local approximation breaks down for short time intervals , which includes the instant at the initial time . a more careful analysis",
    "would need to include a more physical initial state than the factorized one used here .",
    "fluctuations in the quantum field is expected to affect the particle s motion causing it to fluctuate by an amount @xmath91 around the mean trajectory @xmath60 given by solutions to the semi - classical equation ( [ eff_mean_eom ] ) .",
    "we derived such a stochastic force @xmath291 $ ] with correlators from the fluctuations of the quantum field and a scalar ald - langevin equation ( [ stoch_ald ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath91 ( [ particle_perts ] ) contains a non - markovian contribution through the past history of the particle fluctuations .",
    "depending on the behavior of this term the fluctuations might grow to be large indicating a breakdown of the linear approximation . in that case",
    "it requires the inclusion of quantum corrections in order to follow the nonlinear evolution of @xmath91 . on the other hand , ignoring the noise altogether in ( [ particle_perts ] ) , one can test the stability of numerical simulations in inspiral studies , for example @xcite .    instead of the noise @xmath97 derived here from fluctuations of quantum fields one can replace it with some other classical noise @xmath231 suitably chosen to model some stochastic source in a phenomenological description .",
    "we can still use ( [ particle_perts ] ) to study the effect of such noises on the particle trajectory fluctuations .",
    "however , since the origin for the noise is no longer due to a quantum field we need not worry about keeping up to linear order in @xmath91 in the ald - langevin equation . instead",
    ", expanding the solution for small coupling constant @xmath233 and taking the stochastic expectation value shows that there is , in general , a non - vanishing force ( [ drift ] ) coming completely from the correlations of the stochastic force .",
    "along with the self - force , this noise - induced term would cause the particle to drift off of its background trajectory determined by the external force ( or off of its geodesic motion if @xmath292 vanishes ) .",
    "we hope to explore the consequences of this noise - induced drift in an astrophysical setting and find observable effects on the waveforms of the radiation emitted by the particle and detected by gravitational interferometers like ligo and lisa .    in paper",
    "ii we will apply the same techniques here to study the self - forces and the stochastic semi - classical motions of electric charges coupled to an electromagnetic field and of small black holes coupled to the background spacetime of a massive black hole , respectively .",
