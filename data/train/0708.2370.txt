    "searches for non - baryonic dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) rely on detection of nuclear recoils created by the elastic scattering between a wimp and the detector material .",
    "the current generation of experiments  @xcite attempt to suppress all backgrounds to negligible levels so that any remaining events would be attributed to the wimp signal .",
    "however , as the size of the apparatuses increases and the sensitivity to dark matter improves , some irreducible backgrounds will start to appear , rendering a positive observation of a dark matter signal suspect .",
    "examples of such backgrounds are nuclear recoils due to neutrons generated by cosmic rays in the rock surrounding the detector , or neutrinos from the sun  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of an annual modulation of the interaction rate of dark matter has been suggested  @xcite , but this effect is expected to be small ( a few percent ) .",
    "an unambiguous observation of dark matter in presence of background is possible by detecting the direction of the incoming dark matter particles . as the earth moves in the galactic halo with a velocity of approximately 220  km / s ,",

    ", an experiment can gain orders of magnitude in sensitivity to dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the vector direction of the incoming particle , often referred to as the `` direction tag '' or the `` head - tail '' , is very important since it further increases the sensitivity of a directional detector by approximately an order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the drift experiment  @xcite pioneered the study of directional detection of dark matter and demonstrated the ability to reconstruct the direction of the incoming particles by detecting the direction of recoiling nuclei in a gaseous detector .",
    "however , the capability of detecting the direction tag of the incoming particles has not been demonstrated by any experiment to date .",
    "this paper demonstrates a technique to determine the direction tag ( `` head - tail '' ) of low - energy nuclear recoils created by dark matter particles by using a time - projection chamber ( tpc ) with optical readout developed by the dmtpc collaboration .",
    "the projection of nuclear recoils along the anode wires of the tpc is recorded by a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera imaging the scintillation photons produced during the avalanche process .",
    "the measurement of the direction tag relies on the fact that the stopping power ( de / dx ) of recoiling nuclei depends on their residual energy , and therefore the recoil direction can be tagged from the light distribution along the track .",
    "the energy of the nuclear recoils created by the scattering of low energy neutrons or dark matter particles is of the order of a few kev per nucleon , well below the bragg peak .",

    "the sign of the skewness indicates the slope of the light intensity along the track .",
    "recoils that travel in the direction of the incoming neutrons have a decreasing light profile , and therefore a negative skewness .",
    "since the skewness is dimensionless , it is not affected if the coordinate is multiplied by a constant factor , which in our case is the cosine of the recoil angle with respect to the wire . however , shorter segments can be affected by the finite detector resolution .",

    "the skewness is measured to be negative , as expected for the nuclear recoils from neutrons .",
    "this represents a 6 @xmath24 observation of the `` head - tail '' effect .",
    "because the skewness is computed along the direction of the wires , the asymmetry is easier to observe for longer tracks that are better aligned with the anode wires and create more scintillation light .",

    "the skewness of nuclear recoils is computed using the stopping power and straggling according to the srim simulation .",
    "in addition , detector effects such as diffusion and light detection inefficiencies are included based on the measurements obtained with @xmath10 tracks .",

    "[ fg::recoil_energy_vs_length],width=377 ]    the possibility that the `` head - tail '' asymmetry is created by imperfections in the construction of the tracking chamber is excluded by taking a fraction of the data with anode wires rotated by 180 degrees with respect to the neutron beam .",
    "the measurement of the skewness is consistent in the two data - sets .",
    "we collect data with the neutron beam perpendicular to the anode wires . in this configuration",
    "there are an equal number of recoils traveling in both directions , resulting in an equal number of events with positive and negative skewness .",
    "the average skewness in all events is @xmath25 , consistent with the expected symmetric distribution .",
    "the average skewness due to @xmath10 tracks traveling perpendicularly to the anodes is measured to be @xmath26 , consistent with having symmetrical scintillation transverse to the direction of the trajectory .",
    "the hypothesis that the scintillation signal is affected by recoil tracks leaving the drift region was discarded because such segments would have abrupt endings , which is inconsistent with the slowly dimming signals observed in data . as a final check ,",
    "we collect data without sources and search for signatures that resemble nuclear recoils . in this analysis",
    "we count events with pixel yields at least five standard deviations above the background level .",
    "we measure the rejection rate to be approximately @xmath27 , which can be further improved by taking into account the energy , range and direction of recoil candidates .",
    "a conservative error of 20% was assigned to the density of the 4 gas to account for problems with the pressure measurement .",
    "this measurement was obtained by using a gas - dependent thermo - couple gauge in the nuclear recoil measurements , which was cross - calibrated with a more precise capacitance gauge used in the calibration measurements with alpha particles .",
    "however , the uncertainty of the pressure measurement relates to the exponential error on the gain measurement .",
    "this effect is minimized by assuming that all events are fluorine recoils , and by determining the chamber gain by adjusting the slope in figure  [ fg::recoil_energy_vs_length ] to correspond to the slope of fluorine recoils . using this procedure , the a gain of 8  adc counts per kev",
    "is measured .",
    "this gain was used as input for mc studies and to calibrate the axes of figure  [ fg::recoil_energy_vs_length ] .",
    "other systematic errors on the energy measurement come from the non - uniformity in the gain between wires and the stability of the gain with time .",
    "in addition , the statistical uncertainty on the energy measurements is approximately 10% , as determined from calibration with alpha particles .",
    "the error on the recoil range comes from the non - uniformity in the wire pitch ( 10% ) and the analysis technique that overestimates the range for low - energy recoils with the range close to the diffusion width .",
    "this study demonstrates a method for tagging the direction of low - momentum nuclear recoils generated by the elastic scattering of low - energy neutrons in 4 gas .",
    "the tag of the incoming particle is determined from the profile of the scintillation light along the track trajectory , leading to a 6  @xmath24 observation of the `` head - tail '' effect for recoil energies above 500 kev .    in the near future , these studies will be extended to lower energy recoils produced by a californium-252 source . by using a similar detector but built with higher quality standards ,",
    "the `` head - tail '' effect is expected to be visible down to approximately 100  kev .",
    "these studies have profound implications for the development of directional dark matter detectors , as they proves that `` head - tail '' discrimination is indeed feasible .",
