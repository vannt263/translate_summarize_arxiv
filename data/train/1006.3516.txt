    "<S> using nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory , we compute the time evolution of the current in a mott insulator after a strong electric field is turned on . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the formation of a quasistationary state in which the current is almost time - independent although the system is constantly excited . at moderately strong fields </S>",
    "<S> this state is stable for quite long times . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary current exhibits a threshold behavior as a function of the field , in which the threshold increases with the coulomb interaction and vanishes as the metal - insulator transition is approached .    </S>",
    "<S> nonequilibrium phase transitions and nonlinear transport are becoming central issues in the study of strongly correlated systems . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most basic phenomena is the dielectric breakdown ( destruction of insulating states due to strong electric fields ) @xcite . in mott insulators , </S>",
    "<S> the electron motion is frozen as a result of strong repulsive interactions @xcite , and in equilibrium the doping of carriers into a mott insulator leads to interesting quantum states such as high-@xmath0 superconductivity in two - dimensional materials . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is natural to ask how nonequilibrium carriers behave when electrons in a mott insulator start to move in response to strong electric fields .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the physics of nonlinear transport in correlated electron systems has been studied in oxides @xcite as well as in organic materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in one dimensional mott insulators , dielectric breakdown was observed and it was found that the current increases with a threshold behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the current - voltage ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) characteristics exhibits a strong non - linearity with a negative differential resistivity between the weak current and large current regimes . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the problem of nonlinear transport is attracting interest also in the cold atom community , where a novel realization of the mott insulating state has been achieved . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the effect of a potential gradient was studied to probe the excitation spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical description of nonlinear transport is challenging because one needs to take into account two nonperturbative effects , electric fields and electron - electron interactions , simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> in one - dimensional systems , reliable numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization and the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group are available , and a threshold behavior in the current was indeed observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a many - body schwinger - landau - zener mechanism , in which doubly occupied states ( doublons ) and holes are pair produced by quantum tunneling was proposed as an explanation @xcite . however , in previous studies , a direct calculation of the @xmath1-@xmath2-characteristics is absent since a steady state current can not be easily reached in a finite system . </S>",
    "<S> this made it difficult to compare theory with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> another totally unexplored issue is the temperature effect , where experiments suggest a relatively strong temperature dependence of the current . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present paper is to address these questions using dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , which is suitable for the study of high - dimensional bulk systems . </S>",
    "<S> nonequilibrium dmft @xcite has been used to reveal various types of steady states and relaxation phenomena in the falicov - kimball model @xcite and the hubbard model @xcite . for </S>",
    "<S> the current analysis one must compute the dynamics of the hubbard model at rather strong interactions up to relatively long times . </S>",
    "<S> so far , this task has been prohibitively difficult for impurity solvers based on real - time quantum monte carlo @xcite , but it has become accessible recently through an implementation of the self - consistent hybridization expansion within the keldysh framework @xcite .    in the following we focus on the mott insulating phase in the half - filled hubbard model on a @xmath3-dimensional cubic lattice with lattice spacing @xmath4 , @xmath5 here @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron with spin @xmath8 at lattice site @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the local coulomb repulsion , and @xmath11 describes hopping between the sites . to study the dielectric breakdown of the mott insulator , we initially prepare the system in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath12 and apply a spacially homogeneous electric field @xmath13 for time @xmath14 . using a gauge with pure vector potential @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath13 is incorporated into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hubbard ] ) by means of the peierls substitution , @xmath17 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the field is chosen to point along the body diagonal @xmath18 of the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> it is turned on to a value @xmath19 within a switching time @xmath20 , @xmath21 , using a switching profile @xmath22 for @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the main results turn out to be independent of the switching , and we choose @xmath24 if not stated otherwise .    in the limit @xmath25 @xcite the problem is solved exactly using nonequilibrium dmft . </S>",
    "<S> the dmft self - consistency equations for finite electric field are identical for the hubbard model and the falicov - kimball model , and they are detailed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the dmft single - site problem , on the other hand , is identical to the zero field case , and we solve it by means of the self - consistent hybridization expansion @xcite up to second order ( one - crossing approximation ) , which is known to be reliable for the insulating phase and the crossover regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we choose units of energy such that the density of states is given by @xmath26 , with a width ( second moment ) @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> time and field are measured in units of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ( @xmath30 ) . in equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> , a first - order mott transition is found in the paramagnetic phase @xcite , with a critical end - point at @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( determined within the one - crossing approximation ) .     in the insulator ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) : ( a ) the current @xmath35 ; results for @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> are multiplied with a factor @xmath37 to match the scale . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) effective temperature @xmath38 and ( c ) , double occupancy @xmath39 for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the thin line shows the thermal expectation value of @xmath3 at temperature @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) current at @xmath40 for various switch - on times @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) current , averaged for @xmath42 , obtained using either nca or oca to solve the dmft impurity problem . ]    after an electric field is turned on in the mott - insulating phase , we either observe the formation of a quasistationary state with time - independent current ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01]a ) , or , for very large values of @xmath19 , the emergence of @xmath43-periodic bloch oscillations ( @xmath36 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01]a ) . in analogy to the falicov - kimball model @xcite , where bloch oscillations are quenched by the interaction , </S>",
    "<S> there is no sharp separation between oscillatory and non - oscillatory regimes , but instead the current behaves irregularly at intermediate fields . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we only study the quasistationary state , which will reveal the dielectric breakdown of the mott insulator at moderately large , possibly experimentally accessible fields .    </S>",
    "<S> since our system is not coupled to a thermal bath , the energy @xmath44 increases at a rate @xmath45 , and thus a stationary state with nonzero current can not exist forever . however , we find that @xmath35 remains remarkably stable even after a considerable energy increase . </S>",
    "<S> this fact becomes clearly evident if one looks at the effective temperature instead of the energy , i.e. , the temperature @xmath46 after a hypothetical thermalization at energy @xmath47 : for @xmath40 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01 ] , e.g. , @xmath38 increases by a factor @xmath48 during times @xmath49 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01]b ) , while @xmath35 remains almost constant . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation of the current and a simultaneous increase in the double occupancy @xmath50 ( fig .  [ fig01]c ) indicate that the current flow causes excitations in the system that are immobile , just like the spin fluctuations in the ground state that lead to a finite double occupancy but no linear response conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> these excitations do not thermalize on the timescale of our simulation . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the current would increase thermally , and @xmath39 would have to match its expectation value in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath51 ( thin line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01]c ) , which is not the case . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is consistent with recent experiments on ultracold gases @xcite , where it was found that artificially created double occupancies in the mott insulator relax only on exponentially long timescales .    </S>",
    "<S> the quasistationary current turns out to be more or less independent on how the field is turned on , and by increasing the switching time @xmath20 one can reduce the otherwise rather strong transient oscillations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01]d ) . even for slow switching </S>",
    "<S> , however , the transient current can be orders of magnitude larger than the stationary current . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is already entailed in the linear response relation @xmath52 which always holds for small enough times . </S>",
    "<S> the transient is at least proportional to @xmath19 , while the long - time limit can be exponentially small ( see below ) . in particular , in the mott insulator at @xmath53 the dc conductivity </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 vanishes , while the integral @xmath55 over the current yields a nonzero static polarizability .    </S>",
    "<S> after averaging over times @xmath42 , the quasistationary current @xmath56 at @xmath33 shows a sharp increase around @xmath57 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01]e ) , which is the hallmark of the dielectric breakdown . </S>",
    "<S> we note that both first order ( nca ) and second order ( oca ) implementations of the self - consistent hybridization expansion yield similar results , but in analogy to equilibrium calculations the insulating behavior is overestimated by nca , such that the increase of the current is shifted to stronger fields . in the following we stick to the more reliable oca as an impurity solver .    , for @xmath33 : cross - like and open symbols correspond to a time average for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> filled symbols result from an extrapolation to @xmath60 [ see panel ( b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the solid black line is obtained by fitting the data for @xmath61 with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fth ] ) [ @xmath62 , @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) long - time evolution of the current for @xmath33 , analyzed by a nonlinear least square fit @xmath64 ( solid lines ) ; the value @xmath56 is shown by the filled symbols in ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the relaxation time @xmath65 . ]    [ fig02 ]    a plot of the conductance @xmath66 on a logarithmic scale reveals a crossover from the temperature - dependent linear response conductivity @xmath67 at small @xmath19 to an almost temperature - independent curve at large @xmath19 ( fig .  [ fig02]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> these data suggest that the quasistationary current has a nonzero @xmath53 limit , which reflects the ground state decay , or dielectric breakdown of the insulator . in analogy to the one - dimensional case @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we will refer to this limiting value as the tunneling current @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the low - temperature data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02]a can be fit with the same exponential law that determines the ground state decay rate in the one - dimensional hubbard model @xcite @xmath69 with a threshold @xmath70 ( solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02]a ) .    for small fields and @xmath71 , the exponentially small @xmath72 is dominated by the linear response current @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , however , we find that thermal and tunneling current do not simply add up in the stationary state , but @xmath66 can become much smaller than @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiar minimum at the crossover between tunneling and linear response regime in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02]a arises because the relaxation to the stationary state becomes slower with decreasing field , such that an average of @xmath35 in a fixed time interval still yields @xmath75 for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of the long - time behavior at intermediate @xmath19 reveals that the stationary current is approached via an exponential decay @xmath77 , where @xmath56 is closer to @xmath72 than it is to the linear response current ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the thermal current indicates that mobile , thermally excited carriers ( and those excited during the switch - on ) are transformed into immobile excitations in the presence of an electric field , such that the linear response current is only visible on a timescale @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , such a behavior must be specific to a closed system , whereas in an open system the coupling to the environment constantly tends to restore the thermal state . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the observed relaxation phenomenon is an interesting topic for future theoretical transport investigations , and it is an open question whether it is a generic feature in closed systems .     to @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> thin solid lines correspond to fits with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta ] ) ; the resulting gap @xmath80 is shown in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) conductance @xmath66 for the stationary current at @xmath61 . for @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> , there is a still a slight drift of the current at the largest times ( see text ) , and we plot time - averages for @xmath58 ( crosses ) and @xmath82 ( open symbols ) . </S>",
    "<S> solid lines are linear fits according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fth ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) the threshold field @xmath83 resulting from the fits in ( c ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig04 ] summarizes the main numerical results of this paper by comparing the current in the tunneling regime ( @xmath84 ) and in the linear response regime ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) . for @xmath87 , the linear response conductivity @xmath74 increases with decreasing temperature , while it becomes exponentially small for @xmath88 , @xmath89 thus signaling the metal - insulator transition at @xmath90 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig04]a and b ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( strictly speaking , the metal - insulator transition displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig04 ] is only a crossover because temperatures are larger than @xmath0 . ) on the other hand , by fitting @xmath66 for @xmath61 with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fth ] ) , we obtain the threshold @xmath70 as a function of the interaction ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig04]c and d ) . </S>",
    "<S> deep in the insulating phase , both @xmath91 and @xmath70 increase linearly with @xmath10 , while they vanish as the metal - insulator transition is approached . because the metal - insulator transition is first order in dmft @xcite , observables in the insulating phase are expected to display nonanalytic behavior not at the actual transition @xmath92 at @xmath53 , but at the spinodal point @xmath93 where the insulator at @xmath53 disappears </S>",
    "<S> however , the precise behavior of @xmath91 and @xmath70 at the transition is difficult to obtain within the current approach : as @xmath70 decreases , a fit of @xmath66 with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fth ] ) becomes increasingly difficult because the stationary state is eventually no longer reached within the numerically accessible times for @xmath94 due to the slow saturation of @xmath35 for small @xmath19 ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02]c ) .    apart from the crossover region at @xmath95 </S>",
    "<S> , however , we do observe the behavior described by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fth ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) over a wide range of temperatures and fields . </S>",
    "<S> although our setup involves a closed system in which energy is conserved , we expect that these dmft results resemble the @xmath1-@xmath2-characteristics of a real mott - insulating material for large and small fields , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> while the quasistationary state can not exist forever in our setup , it can indeed be stable in a real solid provided the excess energy is passed to the lattice . since the tunneling current turns out to be essentially independent of the excitation of the system ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01 ] ) , differences between the quasistationary current in our setup and the stationary current in experiments are expected to be of the order of the linear response current ( [ delta ] ) , which is negligible compared to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fth ] ) for large enough fields . for small fields or high temperatures , on the other hand , the open system should recover the linear response behavior which is lost in the closed system at long times . only in between the linear response and the tunneling regime </S>",
    "<S> one may thus expect that the current depends essentially on details that are not accounted for in the purely electronic description .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ratio @xmath96 is only weakly dependent on the interaction or the bandwidth in the insulator , and it should thus give the correct order of magnitude for the breakdown field in real mott insulators as well . </S>",
    "<S> note that this value , i.e. , @xmath97 , is much larger than the temperature - dependent threshold which is obtained in the experiments of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in connection with a negative differential resistance ( for srcuo@xmath98 , e.g. , @xmath99 at @xmath100 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold behavior in these one - dimensional materials must thus be of a different origin , and indeed collective excitations were proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , as the temperature dependence of the experimental threshold is similar to what is expected for charge - ordered materials . </S>",
    "<S> the larger threshold found in our analysis should be observed in paramagnetic mott insulators when other sources of destabilizing the insulator are not present .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the dielectric breakdown of a mott insulator in the hubbard model by computing the current in a strong electric field @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is the formation of a quasistationary nonequilibrium state with time - independent current , which may be called a field - induced metal . in the limit of small temperature </S>",
    "<S> , the stationary current resembles the exponential law [ eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fth ] ) ] for the ground state decay - rate in a one - dimensional hubbard model due to many - body landau zener tunneling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its value becomes exponentially small below a threshold field which vanishes at the metal - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> although the threshold field is generally quite large it should be experimentally accessible , e.g. , using thin films of insulating material between metallic leads . </S>"
