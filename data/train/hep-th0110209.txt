    "in the past years , an extension of ads / cft correspondence @xcite has been investigated away form conformality .",
    "especially , type iib sugra solutions that describe d3-branes at the conifold singularity beautifully reproduce phenomena of field theories , such as rg flow , duality cascade , chiral symmetry breaking and confinement .",
    "when @xmath1 d3-branes are placed at the conifold singularity , @xmath2 superconformal field theory which is @xmath3 gauge theory with @xmath4 is realized on the branes @xcite .",
    "the addition of @xmath5 fractional d3-branes changes the gauge groups to @xmath6 and breaks the conformal invariance .",
    "as we flow to ir , the gauge coupling constant of @xmath7 diverges and seiberg duality must be performed for better description of the field theory . as the dual theory has similar gauge groups @xmath8 and matter content as the original theory , this process repeats successively .",

    "is dynamically generated @xcite .",
    "the moduli space of vacua is deformed and chiral symmetry is broken by gaugino condensation .",
    "the type iib sugra solution of klebanov - tseytlin ( kt solution ) @xcite descibes d3-branes at the conifold singurality and incorporates this cascade . the ns - ns @xmath9 field that corresponds to the gauge couplings @xmath10 has logarithmic radial dependence . and",

    "it has asymptotically the same form as klebanov - tseytlin @xcite solution , while near the origin , the singularity of the conifold is deformed and the branes are replaced with fluxes .",
    "so it signals confinement in the gauge theory @xcite .    in this paper , we extend these results to the @xmath0 gauge theory . in the type iia brane configurations , there are two possibilities to obtain @xmath11 or @xmath12 gauge group .",

    "construction of sugra solutions in the presence of orientifold planes takes two steps .",
    "as we will show , all the fields in the ansatz of kt / ks solutions have even parity with respect to the orientifold projection @xmath271 .",
    "hence kt / ks solution survives the projection .",
    "all we have to do is simply giving suitable boundary conditions .",
    "in kt / ks solutions , 2-form gauge fields @xmath272 and their field strengths are expressed by linear combination of the following 2-forms @xmath273 and 3-forms @xmath274 see appendix [ sec : app ] for our conventions .",
    "these 2-forms and 3-forms have odd parity under space - time part of the projection , @xmath275 . on the other hand , the metric of the singular / deformed conifold and five form field strenth which is proportional to the volume form of @xmath238 space have even parity under @xmath47 . as for @xmath276 , 2-forms @xmath277 and @xmath278",
    "have odd parity .",
    "therefore , all fields in kt / ks solution are even under the whole projection @xmath279 .",
    "next we consider proper boundary conditions for the background which corresponds to @xmath30 gauge theory . in order to find this",
    ", we use the type iia brane picture . in @xmath137 case",
    ", whole d4-branes contribute to d3-charges in type iib theory and fractional d4-branes contribute to d5-charges . at first sight",
    "there might appear @xmath31 fractional d4-branes .",
    "but two of the fractional d4-branes and the o4@xmath23-plane in the ns - ns interval and the o4@xmath24-plane in the ns-ns interval give one unit of d3-charge in type iib picture .",
    "so d5-charges of this configuration will be @xmath5!.    in the case of @xmath30 theory , we propose the following boundary condition in covering space , @xmath280 the corresponding kt / ks solution is obtained by only replacing @xmath1 with @xmath281 .      in the deformed conifold which captures correct ir nature of the gauge theory , there are two fixed points at the north and south poles of @xmath257 .",
    "are these fixed points o3@xmath23-plane or o3@xmath24-plane ? from t - dualized type iia picture , we expect that one is o3@xmath24-plane and the other @xmath282-plane .",
    "but boundary conditions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc ] ) are only aware of overall fluxes and seem to smear such microscopic input .",
    "as investigated in @xcite , the o3@xmath24-plane can be interpreted as the o3@xmath23-plane wrapped by an @xmath283-shaped ns5-brane .",
    "so our boundary condition might be understood as o3@xmath23-planes placed at both north and south poles of @xmath257 and the wrapped ns5-brane is smeared .    aside from the interpretation of our boundary condition , the orientifolded conifold includes @xmath283 in interesting way . in the coordinate @xmath284 and @xmath285 ,",
    "the orbifold part of the orientifold projection is @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "consider @xmath288 obtained by setting @xmath269 to be constant .",
    "let the @xmath254 in @xmath257 shrink toward the north pole as we increase radial coordinate from the apex @xmath289 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rp5 ] ) . in this way",
    ", we obtain @xmath290 in the conifold that surround the north pole ( @xmath291 ) as `` join '' of two @xmath254 s . @xmath99 acts on the @xmath290 as anti - podal map ,",
    "hence @xmath292 is obtained .",
    "direct computation shows that @xmath293 is @xmath28 eigen vector of @xmath294 .",
    "so diagonal @xmath254 becomes @xmath283 .",
    "as for the south pole , @xmath292 and @xmath283 are also obtained in the same way .",
    "these two @xmath283 are continuously moved to each other by changing @xmath269 .",
    "this implies that configuration of the @xmath295-plane at the north pole and the @xmath282-plane at the south pole is equivalent to the @xmath282-plane at the north pole and the @xmath295-plane at the south pole . at the bottom of duality cascade ,",
    "either of the gauge groups might be regarded as flavor symmetry , this might be interpreted @xmath11 and @xmath12 gauge theory can be continuously interpolated in the ir as found in @xcite",
    ".    the @xmath283 might be essential to explain the duality cascade phenomenon on the type iib side .",
    "firstly , let us interpret @xmath281 units of d3-charge as @xmath296 .",
    "@xmath297 of them come from d3-branes and @xmath28 comes from two o3@xmath23-planes . for convenience sake , let us suppose @xmath25 fractional d3-branes are stuck on the o3@xmath23-plane at the north pole and @xmath297 fractional d3-branes are stuck on the o3@xmath23-plane at the south pole . as mentioned above the o3@xmath24-plane can be regarded as the o3@xmath23-plane wrapped by ns5-brane .",
    "two units of fractional d3-charge that convert o3@xmath23-plane to o3@xmath24-plane come from chern - simons - like coupling on the ns5-brane @xcite .",
    "let the ns5-brane enclose the o3@xmath23-plane at the south pole .",
    "then we may interpret the o3@xmath23-plane and 2 fractional d3-charges as the o3@xmath24-plane .",
    "so the gauge group can be identified as @xmath298 . on each step of duality cascade ,",
    "d3-charges decrease by @xmath5 units .",
    "hence we have @xmath299 fractional d3-charges at the north pole and @xmath300 at the south pole .",
    "this time we propose that the ns5-brane encloses the o3@xmath23-plane at the north pole .",
    "so we have @xmath301 gauge groups which agree with duality cascade eq .",
    "( [ eq : cascade ] ) .    to reproduce the correct cascade , the ns5-brane has to bounce between the north and the south pole during the cascade steps . above proposal",
    "is natural from the view point of the type iia picture , since as mentioned in sec [ sec : iiapicture ] the o4@xmath24-plane in the ns-ns interval becomes the o4@xmath23-plane after brane crossing .",
    "in section [ sec : detoproj ] , we have succeeded to determine the projection on the gauge theory side , which corresponds to the o3-plane in the conifold on the type iib side and the o4-plane in type iia elliptic models .",
    "it is tempting to generalize the orientifold projection to the case of generalized conifolds @xmath302 . again",
    "type iia models are most illustrative pictures where the generalized conifolds are realized as transversal @xmath175 ns5-branes and @xmath303 ns5-branes @xcite . in these pictures",
    "the o4-plane is still allowed when @xmath304 is even @xcite .    above brane configurations",
    "are obtained from @xmath1 parallel ns5-branes by rotating some of the ns5-branes .",
    "since the o4-projection is well - defined through all the interpolating theory , it is sufficient to consider the case of parallel ns5-branes .",
    "this configuration corresponds to @xmath305 quiver gauge theory in the type iib picture .      before analyzing the o4-plane case in the type iia picture ,",
    "let us recall what takes place in the o6-plane case @xcite .",
    "we simply review the @xmath306 - @xmath306 case with @xmath307 susy in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "the brane configurations are @xmath1 ns5-branes along @xmath13 , d4-branes along @xmath15 , and 2 @xmath306-planes along @xmath308 .",
    "we consider the case that two ns5-branes intersect the o6-planes ( fig .",

    "therefore @xmath1 is even .    taking the t - duality along the @xmath18 direction",

    "let us see the spectrum on the d3-branes world - volume theory without the o7-plane .",
    "this theory is obtained from @xmath310 @xmath311 gauge theory by orbifold projection @xcite . in @xmath2 language , this theory has 3 adjoint chiral superfields @xmath312 which correspond to the transverse directions to the d3-branes . and the superpotential is @xmath313)$ ] . @xmath314 orbifold projection @xmath315 acts on each chan - paton sector as @xmath316 gauge fields surviving the orbifold projection are @xmath317 which give @xmath318 gauge groups .",

    "projection nicely matches with the brane configuration .",
    "we take @xmath341-th and @xmath1-th ns5-branes as intersecting with o6-planes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : o6ando4model ] ( a ) ) .",

    ", the d4-branes are related to ones in the same chan - paton sector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : o6ando4model ] ( b ) ) .",

    ", the projection in the type iib @xmath347 orbifold relates open strings that connect adjacent fractional d4 branes with opposit orientation in the same chan - paton sector .",
