    "@xcite presented a new design for an optomechanical system that consists of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide .",
    "this design has several attractive features .",
    "besides its universality , it enables one to study the reactive effects @xcite in optomechanical coupling .",
    "the origin of the reactive coupling is well explained in ref .",
    "its origin lies in the mechanical motion dependence of the extrinsic losses of the disk resonator .",
    "further phase - dependent gradient forces lead to reactive coupling .",
    "have also argued that this design is more effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state .",
    "while cooling is desirable for studying quantum effects at the macroscopic scale @xcite , we examine other possibilities , which do not depend on the cooling of the system , to investigate the effects arising from strong reactive coupling .",
    "since optomechanical coupling effects are intrinsically nonlinear , we examine the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump probe fields .",
    "we report reactive - coupling - induced normal mode splitting .",
    "note that in previous works @xcite on normal mode splitting in optomechanical devices , only dispersive coupling was used . in this paper",
    ", we report on normal mode splitting due to reactive effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the physical system is introduced and the time evolutions of the expectation values of the system operators are given and solved . in sec .",
    "iii , the expectation value of the output fields is calculated , and the nonlinear susceptibilities for stokes and anti - stokes processes are obtained . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss normal mode splitting in output fields with or without reactive coupling .",
    "we find that there is no normal mode splitting in output fields in the absence of reactive coupling .",
    "however , normal mode splitting occurs in output fields in the presence of reactive coupling .",
    "we consider the system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in which a microdisk cavity is coupled to a freestanding waveguide . a strong pump field with frequency @xmath0 and a weak stokes field with frequency @xmath1 enter the system through the waveguide .",
    "the waveguide will move along the @xmath2 direction under the action of the optical force exerted by the photons from the cavity .",
    "further , considering the dispersive coupling and reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity , displacement @xmath3 of the waveguide from its equilibrium position will change the resonant frequency of the cavity field and the cavity decay rate , represented by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .    in a rotating frame at pump frequency @xmath0 ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xcite @xmath6c^{\\dag}c+\\frac{p^2}{2m}+\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_{m}^2q^2\\vspace{0.1in}\\\\\\hspace{0.3in}+\\hbar\\frac { l}{c}\\tilde{n}_{g}(\\omega_{l}\\varepsilon_{l}^2+\\omega_{s}|\\varepsilon_{s}|^2)+i\\hbar\\sqrt{2\\kappa_{e}(q)}\\varepsilon_{l}(c^{\\dag}-c)\\vspace{0.1in}\\\\\\hspace{0.3 in } + i\\hbar\\sqrt{2\\kappa_{e}(q)}(\\varepsilon_{s}e^{-i\\delta t}c^{\\dag}-\\varepsilon^{*}_{s}e^{i\\delta t}c ) .",

    "the second and third terms are the energy of the waveguide with mass @xmath8 , frequency @xmath9 , and momentum operator @xmath10 .",
    "the fourth term gives the interactions between the waveguide and the incident fields ( the pump field and the stokes field ) , @xmath11 is the length of the waveguide , @xmath12 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath13 is the group index of the waveguide optical mode @xcite , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the amplitudes of the pump field and the stokes field , respectively , and they are related to their corresponding power @xmath16 and @xmath17 by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the latter two terms describe the coupling of the cavity field to the pump field and the stokes field , respectively .",
    "and @xmath20 is the detuning between the stokes field and the pump field .",
    "we would study the physical effects by scanning the stokes laser .    for a small displacement @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "can be expanded to the first order of @xmath3 , @xmath21 thus the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 describe the cavity - waveguide dispersive and reactive coupling strength , respectively .",
    "further , note that the photons in the cavity can leak out of the cavity by an intrinsic damping rate @xmath24 of the cavity and by a rate of @xmath5 due to the reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity .",
    "in addition , the velocity of the waveguide is damped at a rate of @xmath25 . applying the heisenberg equation of motion and adding the damping terms , the time evolutions of the expectation values ( @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ) for the system",
    "can be expressed as    @xmath28-\\gamma_{m}\\langle p\\rangle,\\vspace{0.2in}\\\\",

    "it should be noted that the steady - state solution of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) contains an infinite number of frequencies . since the stokes field @xmath32 is much weaker than the pump field @xmath14 , the steady - state solution of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) can be simplified to first order in @xmath32 only .",
    "we find that in the limit @xmath33 , each @xmath34,@xmath35 , and @xmath27 has the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 stands for any of the three quantities @xmath3 , @xmath10 , and @xmath12 .",

    "( [ 4 ] ) into eq .

    "the approach used in this paper is similar to our earlier work @xcite which dealt with optomechanical systems with dispersive coupling only .",
    "to investigate the normal mode splitting of the output fields , we need to calculate their expectation value .",
    "it can be obtained by using the input - output relation @xcite @xmath52 . if we write @xmath53 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the response at the pump frequency @xmath0",
    ", @xmath56 is the response at the stokes frequency @xmath1 , and @xmath57 is the field generated at the new anti - stokes frequency @xmath58 .",
    "then we have @xmath59 furthermore , whether there is normal mode splitting in the output fields is determined by the roots of the denominator @xmath60 of @xmath56 . here",
    "we examine the roots of @xmath60 given by eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) numerically .",
    "the response of the system is expected to be especially significant if we choose @xmath1 corresponding to a sideband @xmath61 or @xmath62 , so we consider the case @xmath63 .",
    "the other parameters are chosen from a recent experiment focusing on the effect of the reactive force on the waveguide @xcite : the wavelength of the laser @xmath64 nm , @xmath65 mhz / nm , @xmath66 pg ( density of the silicon waveguide , 2.33 g/@xmath67 ; length , 10 @xmath68 m ; width , 300 nm ; height , 300 nm ) , @xmath69 , @xmath70 mhz , and the mechanical quality factor @xmath71 . in the following , we work in the stable regime of the system .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the variation of the real parts of the roots of @xmath60 in the domain re@xmath72 with increasing pump power for no reactive coupling , @xmath73 , and for @xmath74 mhz / nm . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the interaction of the waveguide with the cavity is purely dispersive ; the cavity decay rate does not depend on the displacement of the waveguide . in this case",
    ", the real parts of the roots of @xmath60 always have two equal values with increasing pump power .",
    "thus there is no splitting because the dispersive coupling is not strong enough .",
    "however , for @xmath74 mhz / nm , the system has both dispersive and reactive couplings , the cavity decay rate depends on the displacement of the waveguide , and the real parts of the roots of @xmath60 will change from two equal values to two different values with increasing pump power . and the difference between two real parts of the roots of @xmath60 in the domain re@xmath72 is increased with increasing pump power .",
    "therefore , the reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity can result in normal mode splitting of the output fields , and the peak separation becomes larger with increasing pump power .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the variation of the imaginary parts of the roots of @xmath60 with increasing pump power for zero reactive coupling @xmath73 and nonzero reactive coupling @xmath74 mhz / nm . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the imaginary parts of the roots of @xmath60 do not change with increasing pump power .",
    "however , for @xmath74 mhz , the imaginary parts of the roots of @xmath60 change with increasing pump power . we thus conclude that for the present microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide the normal mode splitting is solely due to the reactive coupling .",
    "we now discuss how the output fields depend on the behavior of the roots of @xmath60 . for convenience ,",
    "we normalize all quantities to the input stokes power @xmath17 . assuming that @xmath32 is real , we express the output power at the stokes frequency @xmath1 in terms of the input stokes power @xmath75 further",
    ", we introduce the two quadratures of the stokes component of the output fields by @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "one can measure either the quadratures of the output by homodyne techniques or the intensity of the output . for brevity ,",
    "we only show @xmath78 and @xmath79 as a function of the normalized detuning between the stokes field and the pump field @xmath80 for this model , without reactive coupling ( @xmath23=0 ) and with it ( @xmath74 mhz / nm ) , for different pump powers in figs .",
    "[ fig4][fig5 ] . for @xmath23=0",
    ", it is found that @xmath78 has a lorentzian lineshape corresponding to the absorptive behavior .",
    "note that @xmath78 and @xmath79 exhibit no splitting when @xmath23=0 .",
    "however , for @xmath74 mhz / nm , it is clearly seen that normal mode splitting appears in @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore reactive coupling can lead to the appearance of normal mode splitting in the output stokes field .",
    "and the peak separation increases with increasing pump power @xcite .",
    "the dip at the line center exhibits power broadening .",
    "we also find that the stokes field can be amplified by the stimulated process .",
    "obviously the maximum gain @xmath79 for the stokes field depends on the system parameters . for a pump power @xmath81 @xmath68w ,",
    "the maximum gain for the stokes field is about 1.3 .",
    "note that the nonlinear nature of the reactive coupling generates anti - stokes radiation . in a similar way",
    ", we define a normalized output power at the anti - stokes frequency @xmath58 as @xmath82 the plots of @xmath83 versus the normalized detuning between the stokes field and the pump field @xmath80 for this model , without reactive coupling ( @xmath23=0 ) and with it ( @xmath74 mhz / nm ) , for different pump powers are presented in fig .",
    "we can see that @xmath84 for @xmath23=0 .",
    "the reason is that the dispersive coupling constant @xmath22 is too small .",
    "however , for @xmath74 mhz / nm , @xmath83 is not equal to zero .",
    "this shows that the optomechanical system can generate an anti - stokes field with frequency @xmath85 due to the reactive coupling . for pump power @xmath81 @xmath68w ,",
    "the maximum gain defined with reference to the input stokes power for the anti - stokes field is about 0.1 .",
    "in conclusion , we have observed normal mode splitting of output fields due to reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity .",
    "meanwhile , the separation of the peaks increases for larger pump powers .",
    "further , the reactive coupling can also cause four - wave mixing , which creates an anti - stokes component generated by the optomechanical system .",
