    "the discovery of a close relationship between the nature of quantum gravity and the thermodynamics of black holes has been one of the most important developments in general relativity in the past decades .",
    "strong motivation for studying thermodynamics of black holes originates from the fact that they have a very natural thermodynamic description . for example , black holes have an entropy and temperature related to their horizon area and surface gravity , respectively , and also one can investigate their thermal stability . with the appearance of the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory correspondence ( ads / cft ) @xcite , such black holes in asymptotically ads space become even more interesting since one can gain some significant relations between the thermodynamical properties of the ads black holes and the dual conformal field theory @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is a general belief that in four dimensions the topology of the event horizon of an asymptotically flat stationary black hole is uniquely determined to be the two - sphere @xmath1 @xcite . hawking s theorem requires the integrated ricci scalar curvature with respect to the induced metric on the event horizon to be positive @xcite .",
    "this condition applied to two - dimensional manifolds determines uniquely the topology .",
    "the `` topological censorship theorem '' of friedmann , schleich and witt is another indication of the impossibility of non spherical horizons @xcite .",
    "however , when the asymptotic flatness of spacetime is violated , there is no fundamental reason to forbid the existence of static or stationary black holes with nontrivial topologies .",
    "it has been shown that for asymptotically ads spacetime , in the four - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory , there exist black hole solutions whose event horizons may have zero or negative constant curvature and their topologies are no longer the two - sphere @xmath1 .",
    "the properties of these black holes are quite different from those of black holes with usual spherical topology horizon , due to the different topological structures of the event horizons .",
    "besides , the black hole thermodynamics is drastically affected by the topology of the event horizon . it was argued that the hawking - page phase transition @xcite for the schwarzschild - ads black hole does not occur for locally ads black holes whose horizons have vanishing or negative constant curvature , and they are thermally stable @xcite . the studies on the topological black holes have been carried out extensively in many aspects ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we shall consider topological black branes in the presence of dilaton and electromagnetic fields in all higher dimensions .",
    "the action of the @xmath0-dimensional @xmath2 einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ricci scalar * * , * * @xmath5 is a kinetic term , @xmath6 is a potential term for the dilaton field @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a coupled lagrangian between scalar dilaton and electromagnetic fields . in @xmath9 , @xmath10 is an arbitrary constant governing the strength of the coupling between the dilaton and the maxwell field , @xmath11 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath12 is the electromagnetic potential . while @xmath13 corresponds to the usual einstein - maxwell - scalar theory , @xmath14 indicates the dilaton - electromagnetic coupling that appears in the low energy string action in einstein s frame .",
    "some attempts have been made to explore various solutions of einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity .",
    "the dilaton field couples in a nontrivial way to other fields such as gauge fields and results into interesting solutions for the background spacetime @xcite .",
    "these scalar coupled black hole solutions @xcite , however , are all asymptotically flat . it was argued that with the exception of a pure cosmological constant , no dilaton - de sitter or anti - de sitter black hole solution exists with the presence of only one liouville - type dilaton potential @xcite . in the presence of one or two liouville - type potentials , black hole spacetimes which are neither asymptotically flat nor ( a)ds have been explored by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the cosmological constant term  in the dilaton gravity has been found by gao and zhang @xcite . with an appropriate combination of three liouville - type dilaton potentials",
    ", they obtained the static dilaton black hole solutions which are asymptotically ( a)ds in four and higher dimensions .",
    "in such a scenario ads spacetime constitutes the vacuum state and the black hole solution in such a spacetime becomes an important area to study @xcite . for an arbitrary value of @xmath10 in ads spaces the form of the dilaton potential @xmath15 in @xmath16 dimensions",

    "the motivations for studying such dilaton black holes with nonvanishing cosmological constant originate from supergravity theory . gauged supergravity theories in various dimensions are obtained with negative cosmological constant in a supersymmetric theory .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that one may consider a big bang model of the universe in the presence of dilaton field and presented liouville - type potential which can mimic the matter ( including dark matter ) and dark energy .",
    "this model predict age of the universe , transition redshift , big bang nucleosynthesis and evolution of dark energy agree with current observations @xcite .",
    "also , this type of potential can be obtained when a higher dimensional theory is compactified to four dimensions , including various super gravity models @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent discussion of these aspects ) . in particular , for special values of coupling constant , @xmath19 , this potential reduce to the supersymmetry potential of gates and zwiebach in string theory @xcite .    for later convenience",
    "we redefine @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the ads radius of spacetime .",
    "it is clear the cosmological constant is coupled to the dilaton in a very nontrivial way . in the absence of the dilaton field action ( [ action ] ) reduces to the action of einstein - maxwell gravity with cosmological constant .",
    "considering this type of dilaton potential , one can extract successfully the ads solutions of einstein  maxwell - dilaton gravity @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is outlined as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the field equations of einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity and present the @xmath0-dimensional topological ads black brane solutions and investigate their properties . in section [ therm ] , we obtain the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the solutions and verify the validity of the first law of black brane thermodynamics .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study topological ads black branes of @xmath0-dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory and investigate their properties . </S>",
    "<S> we use the area law , surface gravity and gauss law interpretations to find entropy , temperature and electrical charge , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also employ the modified brown and york subtraction method to calculate the quasilocal mass of the solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a smarr - type formula for the mass as a function of the entropy and the charge , compute the temperature and the electric potential through the smarr - type formula and show that these thermodynamic quantities coincide with their values which are calculated through using the geometry . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we perform a stability analysis in the canonical ensemble and investigate the effects of the dilaton field and the size of black brane on the thermal stability of the solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that large black branes are stable but for small black brane , depending on the value of dilaton field and type of horizon , we encounter with some unstable phases . </S>"
