    "the study of stars with large proper motions forms the basis of our knowledge of the stellar content and dynamical structure of the galaxy .",
    "it is largely through surveys of high proper motion ( hpm ) stars that the census of stars in the solar vicinity has been established .",
    "since the proper motion of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from the observer , a high proper motion is a strong selection criterion for proximity .",
    "the power of proper motion as a selection tool is well illustrated when we consider that among the billions of stars brighter than about 20th magnitude that fill the sky , those with proper motions @xmath4 larger than half of a second of arc per year ( @xmath5 ) are numbered in the thousands .",
    "the stellar proper motion is also proportional to the velocity of the star , projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "this is the main drawback for samples of nearby stars derived from hpm surveys : stars which are moving toward or away from the sun are systematically missed .",
    "another effect is that samples of hpm stars are always over - represented with stars having large transverse velocities .",
    "essentially , the high velocity stars are sampled over a larger volume than the low velocity stars . while this may bias statistical studies of hpm samples , it is actually extremely useful for finding old disk and halo stars , which are rare in the solar neighborhood , and crucial to our understanding of the structure and stellar content of the galaxy as a whole",
    ".    of course , direct parallax measurements are ultimately the best method to measure the distances to the stars .",
    "however , even the most complete survey to date , carried out by the hipparcos astrometric satellite , is limited to the brightest hundred thousand stars in the sky ( brighter than about 12th magnitude , see the _ hipparcos and tycho catalogs _",
    "perryman 1997 ) .",
    "next - generation astrometric mission are being planned ( the gaia mission , see lindegren & perryman 1996 ; the diva mission , see rser 1999 ) which will eventually obtain parallaxes for hundreds of millions more stars . but",
    "the identification of nearby stars in the 12th-20th magnitude range still depends largely on surveys of high proper motion stars .    to date",
    ", the most extensive catalogs of high proper motion stars remain the two catalogs by w. h. luyten , published over 20 years ago .",
    "one , the _ lhs catalogue : a catalogue of stars with proper motions exceeding 0.5@xmath6 annually _ ( luyten 1979 ) lists 3602 objects with estimated proper motions @xmath7 yr@xmath2 and 867 other stars with estimated proper motions @xmath8 yr@xmath2 . the _ lhs catalogue _ was compiled from previous lists of known hpm stars and from a list of new hpm stars detected in the 1950 s palomar sky survey by hand - blink or with an automated blink - machine .",
    "the complete catalog is available at the vizier service of the _ centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg _ ( http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/ ) under catalog number i/87b .",
    "the _ new luyten catalogue of stars with proper motions larger than two tenths of an arcsecond _ ( nltt , luyten 1979 ) lists 58845 hpm stars , the majority of which have estimated proper motions @xmath9 yr@xmath2 . the nltt catalogue is essentially an extension of the lhs catalogs to stars with smaller proper motions , and is also available at the vizier service under catalog number i/98a .",
    "both the lhs and nltt catalogs were first published in a printed version based on a typewriter copy of the catalog , and both are thus subject to occasional typos and misprints , only a few of which are obvious .",
    "the entire lhs catalog has been recently investigated by bakos , sahu , & nmeth ( 2002 ) , who searched for each and every one of the lhs stars in the digitized sky survey .",
    "while they were able to recover the majority of the lhs stars , they found substantial errors in the coordinates quoted by luyten .",
    "a small number of lhs stars could not even be recovered at all , raising serious doubts as to the reliability of the luyten catalogs .",
    "furthermore , the lhs and nltt are also clearly incomplete in some parts of the sky , especially in the southern hemisphere and at low galactic latitudes .",
    "the incompleteness of the luyten catalogs , and the large inaccuracies it sometimes contains , make it a less than completely reliable tool in an epoch where data mining of large electronic databases is becoming an important aspect of astronomical research .    while other surveys of high proper motion stars have been conducted since the publication of the lhs and nltt catalogs , these surveys have been more limited in magnitude range or in survey area .",
    "the most notable is the survey conducted with the hipparcos satellite ( hipparcos and tycho catalog , esa 1997 ; tycho-2 catalog , hog _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) which covers the whole sky but is complete only for relatively bright ( @xmath10 ) stars .",
    "deeper large proper motion surveys include the ucac survey conducted by the us . naval observatory , which reaches @xmath11 and covers the whole sky south of @xmath12 , and the supercosmos sky survey ( hambly _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) which so far covers 5000 square degrees in the southern galactic cap ( 15% of the sky ) down to @xmath13 .",
    "other deep surveys covering smaller areas include the search for very high proper motion stars in 1400 square degrees of second epoch palomar sky survey plates by monet _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) , the calar - eso proper motion survey ( ruiz _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , and the southern survey by wroblewski & costa ( 2001 ) .",
    "other proper motion surveys have been conducted using fields monitored by gravitational microlensing experiments : the eros 2 proper motion survey ( eros collaboration 1999 ) , and a search of the macho data archive ( alcock _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) .    for the past few years",
    ", we have been conducting our own systematic , automated survey for high proper motion stars using the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "we are searching for high proper motion stars in the dss with superblink , a powerful software developed by one of us ( sl ) .",
    "superblink is an extremely efficient , fully automated , blink - comparator which can be used to identify variable and moving objects in any pair of fits images of a field observed at two different epochs .",
    "we have been feeding dss images to our superblink software and assembling a new catalog of hpm stars , complete with `` blinkable '' double - epoch finder charts .",
    "this first paper of a series presents some of the first results of our efforts : an updated census of hpm stars with @xmath14 yr@xmath2 down to a magnitude r=20.0 north of -2.8@xmath15 in declination and at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we report the recovery of 640 luyten stars and the discovery of 141 new hpm stars within this area . a second series of papers ( lpine et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) will present the results of our parallel campaign of spectroscopic observations of those new high proper motion stars .    in  2",
    ", we describe the data retrieval , image handling , candidate identification , and photometry .  3 and  4 contrast our results with the tycho and luyten catalogs .",
    "finder charts for all the new high proper motion stars are printed in the appendix .",
    "we are retrieving digitized sky survey ( dss ) images from the space telescope science institute archive server ( archive.stsci.edu ) using linux scripts , with the kind permission of the catalogs and surveys branch at the stsci .",
    "our first epoch images the scanned palomar sky survey ( poss - i , abell 1959 ) red ( xx103ae + plexi ) images which have been obtained circa 1950 and have been scanned with a resolution of 1.7@xmath6 pixel@xmath2 . the second epoch images , the scanned second palomar sky survey ( poss - ii , reid _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) red ( iiiaf + rg 610 ) images are generally of higher quality , and have been scanned with a resolution of 1.00 to 1.02 @xmath6 pixel@xmath2 .",
    "we adopted the following strategy : the poss - i image is used as a reference frame onto which we attempt to match the poss - ii image , to generate two image that look as similar as possible and that can be easily subtracted to reveal the differences between the two epochs .",
    "the first epoch survey covers the entire sky north of @xmath17 in a grid of @xmath18 plates with a small overlap region at the sides of the plates ( 643 plates in all ) .",
    "the poss - ii plates cover the same region with plates of similar sizes , but with a larger overlap between neighboring plates , and thus with a larger number of plates to cover the northern sky . as a result",
    ", there is no direct correspondence between the poss - i and poss - ii plates , and the same region of the sky can appear in very different locations on the first and second epoch plates .",
    "this means that larger scale distortions in the plates can be significantly different in the poss - i and poss - ii . since we are using a differential technique to identify high proper motion stars",
    ", the correspondence between the two fields must be extremely tight .    for these reasons",
    ", we are working on small subfields of the digitized sky survey representing areas on the poss - i and poss - i plates no larger than @xmath19 in size .",
    "we arrived at this figure after intensive experimentation with dss subfields .",
    "we found that superposition of poss - i and poss - i fields of this size is reasonably accurate and straightforward , and can be easily handled by the software .",
    "we have mapped the whole sky north of @xmath17 into 642,900 subfields , allowing for a significant overlap between the fields .",
    "the superblink software uses optimization techniques to align the two images and to degrade and normalize the second epoch images so that they match the aspect and quality of the earlier epoch image .",
    "the code then simply subtracts the two images and identifies significant features in the residuals . in order for the residual image to contain significant information , the two images must be aligned very precisely .",
    "the process is illustrated in figure 1 .    to align the images",
    ", the code proceeds in a series of steps .",
    "first the image with the highest angular resolution per pixel element is remapped onto a grid that matches the resolution of the other image . in our data",
    ", it is the poss - ii image ( with resolution of 1.00 , 1.01 , or 1.02@xmath6 pixel@xmath2 ) that is remapped into a grid that matches the poss - i image ( 1.70@xmath6 pixel@xmath2 ) .",
    "this results in a small degradation in the quality of the poss - ii image , but this is of little consequence since the quality of the poss - ii image is always better to start with .",
    "the second step is to normalize the two images to match the intensity levels . for each image",
    ", pixels are separated into _ sky _ pixels and _ star _ pixels .",
    "the mean pixel value and standard deviations are calculated ; any pixel that is above 3 times the mean standard deviation is flagged as a _ star _ pixel and removed from the set .",
    "the process is repeated recursively until all the pixels are flagged as either _ star _ or _",
    "sky_. the sky pixels are then fitted to a plane and the whole image is renormalized so that the mean value of the sky is set to 1 .",
    "the total flux from star pixels is then calculated , and each image is renormalized so that the fluxes above the sky level are equal .    in the third step , the software attempts to minimize the total residuals between the two images by shifting and rotating the higher quality ( poss - ii ) image .",
    "we use a multidimensional minimization algorithm to determine the shift in x and y and the rotation @xmath20 that matches the two images best .",
    "we retrieve the poss - i and poss - ii images based on the coordinates at the center of the images , so we expect the two images to be already aligned in x and y. in effect we find that the centers of the two images are not always perfectly aligned , and a typical shift of a fraction of a pixel ( rarely exceeding 1 pixel ) is usually required .",
    "on the other hand , the two images can be at an angle because they may come from different parts of a poss - i and poss - ii plate ( e.g. upper left corner of a poss - i plate with lower right corner of a poss - ii plate ) which means that the individual images can be oriented differently , with the north pointing in different directions .",
    "we thus sometimes require large values for @xmath20 , up to 40 degrees in high declination fields .",
    "high proper motion stars are identified as pairs of residual features .",
    "the superblink software contains a search algorithm which attempts to match any significant residual feature with another one up to a given distance . while the task appears to be relatively simple , it is actually quite complex because one wants to avoid the systematic identification of any differences between the plates as a high proper motion star .",
    "the poss - i and poss - ii images are scans of photographic plates , and they contain numerous plate defects .",
    "furthermore , the images are filled with large numbers of variable features , from variable stars ( and nebulae ! ) , to asteroid tracks , diffractions spikes and instrumental reflections from bright stars .",
    "the poss - i and poss - ii plates have also been obtained in slightly different bandpasses ( the poss - i plate used an xx103ae emulsion with a plexiglas filter while the poss - ii used a iiiaf emulsion with an rg610 filter ) which means that some objects are expected to have slightly different plate magnitudes .",
    "the poss - ii plate also goes a few magnitudes deeper , and some of the fainter stars do not record on the poss - i plates .",
    "for all these reasons , specific tests have been designed within the code to eliminate most unwanted features while retaining a set of the most likely high proper motion star candidates .    at the same time",
    ", the code remains a general tool for identifying moving objects of any shape and size ( i.e. no attempt is made to fit the variable features with an axisymmetric stellar profile ) .",
    "the reason for this is that high proper motion stars tend to be so close to the sun that long - period binary systems are often resolved . because the psf on the poss images is so broad ( exposure times @xmath21 minutes )",
    ", companions may look like a moving elliptical or pear - shaped object , which can easily be confused with plate defects or short asteroid tracks .",
    "the general procedure to test whether a feature in the residual image is consistent with a high proper motion star is as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the code identified the plate feature in the poss - i or poss - ii image that is responsible for the residual feature .",
    "( 2 ) the plate feature is removed from the poss image in which it is found .",
    "( 3 ) the modified plate image , lacking the plate feature , is then subtracted from the second plate image . ( 4 ) the plate feature is then matched to any plate feature remaining on the second plate image after the subtraction . because the first plate image is complete except for the now removed candidate moving feature , subtracting it from the second plate image removes everything except the counterpart of the moving object on the second plate image .",
    "( 5 ) a probability of match is calculated based on the similarity between the two features .",
    "the code also calculates the proper motion and estimates the magnitude of the candidate high proper motion star .    the detailed algorithm has been tested and specifically adapted to work best on scans of photographic plates , and it achieves extremely high detection rates .",
    "a significant problem arises when a hpm star moves into the image of a brighter star on one plate ( when this happens , we say that the high proper motion star passes `` in front of '' the brighter star ) .",
    "when this occurs , the residual image of the high proper motion star is assigned by the code to the brighter star because the code has no way of knowing that the residual image is due to a proper motion star passing in front of the bright star .",
    "fortunately , hpm events always leave _ two _ distinct traces in the residual images , so if one of the residual images corresponds to the image of the hpm object passing in front of a brighter star , the other one will ( most of the time ) be correctly identified .",
    "the code is usually able to make the match with the counterpart passing in front of the brighter star .",
    "this is actually one of the greatest strengths of the code : _ the ability to correctly identify a high proper motion star even if it passes in front of a brighter star on one of the plates_. several of the new high proper motion stars that we have identified with superblink occur in such a fashion .    the only case when the code will definitely miss an hpm star is when the star is passing in front of brighter stars in _ both _ the poss - i and poss - ii plates .",
    "admittedly , this failure of the code could hardly be noticed since such a star is also very likely to escape detection even by careful visual inspection of the plates .",
    "however , this is an important issue because we do expect that a small number of faint , high proper motion stars will escape detection , especially in low galactic latitude fields where crowding can be significant .",
    "the two parameters that determine the computing time used by the superblink code are the lower intensity limit for the detection of faint residual features and the search radius for a matching counterpart .",
    "experiments have shown that for the combination of poss - i and poss - ii plates , optimal results are obtained by limiting the identification of variable features with magnitude brighter than about r=20 , and using a search radius smaller than @xmath22 . using these parameter values ,",
    "a one square degree area can be processed in about 15 minutes on a linux workstation with dual pentium - iii microprocessors .",
    "over 10,000 cpu - hours have been invested so far in searching the northern sky for new hpm stars .",
    "the superblink software provides poss - ii red magnitude estimates for the detected high proper motion stars by simple calculation of the plate flux .",
    "because we only retrieve the red plates , we do not have any direct means to get colors for the objects .",
    "but since the second version of the guide star catalog ( gsc - ii ) catalog has been made publicly available , we have been searching for counterparts of our high proper motion stars in the public version of the gsc - ii ( the gsc2.2.1 catalog ) to obtain poss - ii @xmath23 and @xmath24 colors .",
    "the gsc2.2.1 is based on scans of the photographic sky survey plates , exactly the same material that we are using for our survey , and can be regarded as an improved version of the guide star catalog ( lasker _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 , russell _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 , and jenkner _",
    "et al . _ 1990 ) .",
    "the gsc - ii is maintained by the space telescope science institute , and the gsc2.2.1 is available electronically through the vizier service of the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg ( catalog number i/271 ) .",
    "all entries in the gsc2.2.1 are provided with coordinates and epochs , which correspond to the epoch of the photographic plate when the star was observed . for each gsc2.2.1 star located within 1@xmath25 of one of our hpm stars ,",
    "we calculate the astrometric distance between the location of the gsc2.2.1 star and the estimated location of the hpm star candidate _ at the epoch of the gsc2.2.1 star _ ( recall that our catalog quotes the position of the hpm stars at the 2000.0 epoch ) .",
    "while cross - correlating our sample of high proper motion stars into the gsc2.2.1 catalog , we found that @xmath26 of the stars could be matched with two or more different objects in the gsc2.2.1 catalog . every time this happened ,",
    "the different objects listed in the gsc2.2.1 had different quoted epochs of detections and thus obviously corresponded _ to the same star observed in different poss - ii plates at different epochs_. in most cases , one object has a quoted red magnitude but no blue magnitude , while the other has a blue magnitude , but no red magnitude .",
    "this is because the same star has been observed on plates of different colors at different times .",
    "whenever a star has been observed twice in the same color and quoted as two different objects , we have used the mean of the quoted magnitudes .",
    "a small number of stars were found not to have any gsc2.2.1 counterpart .",
    "the majority of these are stars which are beyond the current magnitude limit of the second guide star catalog ( r=18.5 ) , but a handful of brighter stars could still not be found .",
    "the majority of those missing stars are moderately bright stars that just happened to be passing close to brighter stars at the epoch when the poss - ii image was obtained .",
    "they can be easily identified from the poss - i plates , but their identification is difficult on the poss - ii plates , on which the gsc2.2.1 is based .",
    "in one specific case , the missing star was found on the poss - ii image blended with a bright track left by the passage of an airplane ; it could not possibly have been identified as a star from the poss - ii scans alone .",
    "we use in our catalog the quoted gsc2.2.1 @xmath23 and @xmath24 magnitudes for all the stars we were able to match from gsc2.2.1 . for all other stars ,",
    "we use the @xmath23 magnitude estimated by superblink .",
    "the gsc2.2.1 magnitudes are a significant improvement over the magnitudes quoted in the luyten proper motion catalogues ( see  4.3 below ) .",
    "the superblink software does not work efficiently on stars which are extremely saturated on the dss images .",
    "superblink works best for stars fainter than magnitude @xmath27 and can not handle stars brighter than about @xmath28 at all .",
    "fortunately , the range of magnitudes over which the code is much less efficient corresponds to the faint limit of the stars which have been measured during the hipparcos astrometric mission , and listed in the hipparcos and tycho catalog ( esa 1997 ) and in the tycho-2 catalog ( hog _ et al .",
    "provided that the superblink and tycho samples overlap over a significant range in magnitudes , the two surveys are really complementary , and we thus have a means to build a complete census of all high proper motion stars down to r=20 .",
    "our recovery rate of high proper motion tycho stars in our survey area is plotted in figure 2 as a function of the hipparcos v magnitude .",
    "not a single star in the v=8 magnitude bin was identified by superblink , which sets the absolute upper limit of our code in handling bright stars .",
    "the efficiency rises rapidly as the stars get fainter , and the recovery rate reaches over 80% in the v=10 magnitude bin .",
    "the superblink software was fully successful in recovering the stars in the last magnitude bin of the tycho catalogs ( v=12 ) .",
    "however , this last bin contains only 15 stars , and while this does suggest a high recovery rate , we can not affirm that the code is actually more than about 90% efficient in that range .",
    "nevertheless , this does suggest a good complementarity between the tycho catalogs and our survey .",
    "the combination of high proper motion stars from the tycho catalogs and from our survey should provide a virtually complete census of _ all _ high proper motion stars in the survey area down to the magnitude limit of our survey .",
    "the main limitation lies in that the hipparcos satellite relied on an input catalog , and only observed a subsample of selected stars fainter than v@xmath29 .",
    "because our dss - based survey is incomplete for stars in the @xmath30v@xmath31 range , there is the possibility that some high proper motion stars in that range are not in the tycho catalogs and will not have been recovered in our survey .",
    "the acid test to check if the combined tycho / dss catalog is complete throughout the full range of magnitudes is a comparison with the previous most complete catalog of high proper motion stars : the luyten catalogs .",
    "we find that there are numerous , significant errors in the stellar positions quoted in the lhs and in the nltt catalogs .",
    "the lhs and nltt catalogs are supposed to be essentially redundant for stars with proper motions @xmath14 yr@xmath2 . the main difference between the two is that the nltt catalog also lists stars down to @xmath32 yr@xmath2 . in all appearances ,",
    "the differences are only minor : the lhs catalogs lists 3561 stars with @xmath14 yr@xmath2 while the nltt lists 3555 .",
    "while both the lhs and nltt give r1950 coordinates for all entries , the lhs catalog also gives j2000 coordinates .",
    "the r1950 coordinate should be understood as the coordinate of the star at epoch 1950.0 and equinox 1950 .",
    "the j2000 coordinate refers to the position of the star at epoch 2000.0 in the equatorial coordinate system with equinox 2000 .",
    "we should expect to be able to re - derive the quoted j2000 position by adding the quoted proper motion of the star to the r1950 position and precessing the result . using the electronic version of the catalog obtained from vizier , we have attempted to reproduce this result .",
    "we were quite surprised to find that a large number of stars had significant differences between the j2000 coordinate that we calculated based on the quoted r1950 coordinate and proper motion , and the j2000 coordinate quoted by luyten .",
    "of a total of 4421 stars , 570 showed discrepancies of over 20@xmath6 , 147 showed discrepancies of over 1@xmath25 , and 84 showed discrepancies of over 5@xmath25 .",
    "we find that in the majority of the cases , it is the quoted j2000 coordinate that is clearly in error .",
    "we verified this by matching the stars with large errors with the updated lhs catalog compiled by bakos , sahu , and nmeth ( 2002 ) .",
    "all the stars for which we found a very large discrepancy between the j2000 and r1950 position are those that bakos , sahu , and nmeth were unable to recover in their investigation",
    ". we can therefore identify the main source of their many problems at recovering lhs stars in the dss with the fact that _",
    "they used the error - filled j2000 column as their source of coordinates in the lhs catalog_.    it is most unfortunate that the searchable electronic version of the lhs catalog found at cds uses the j2000 column as the main source of coordinates .",
    "even worse , the simbad database also uses the erroneous column as the main source of coordinates for most objects that are lhs stars .",
    "this leads to a number of hpm stars being quoted twice in the simbad database , with one entry for the lhs star at the erroneous location and another , separate entry for the same star , quoted under its other known names at the accurate location .",
    "we conclude that coordinates quoted in the lhs catalog are extremely unreliable , and that they should be excluded from use in the simbad astronomical database .",
    "in contrast , we found the coordinates retrieved from the electronic version of the nltt catalog to be significantly more reliable .",
    "we have thus compiled a more accurate list of luyten stars by merging the information provided by the lhs and nltt .",
    "unfortunately , the lhs and nltt have different numbering systems , and the only means to match an nltt star with an lhs star is to match their coordinates .",
    "we thus cross - correlated all entries in the lhs and nltt , using both the r1950 and the ( precessed ) j2000 coordinates from the lhs , and the r1950 coordinates for the nltt .",
    "given the sometimes large difference between the positions , we matched the stars by performing several passes using increasingly larger search radii ( up to @xmath33 ) until most of the lhs and nltt stars could be paired .",
    "we found a total of 3554 stars with @xmath14 yr@xmath2 listed in both the lhs and nltt catalog . in the process , we discovered 6 stars which were listed twice in the lhs catalog under different names ( lhs28 and lhs201 , lhs1611 and lhs5086 , lhs2785 and lhs2786 , lhs5126a and lhs6132 , lhs5215a and lhs6231 , lhs5217a and lhs6235 ) . while the lhs r1950 coordinates were generally found to provide the best match to the nltt counterparts , 411 lhs stars could be matched better with nltt objects when we used their precessed j2000 coordinates .",
    "we generally found good agreement between the quoted r1950 positions in the lhs and nltt .",
    "however , most of the nltt coordinates appear to have been copied directly from the lhs , so this is no guarantee that the locations are accurate .",
    "there were 32 lhs stars with @xmath14 yr@xmath2 for which we could not find an nltt counterpart with the automated procedure , and 53 nltt stars with @xmath14 yr@xmath2 which we could not match with an lhs star .",
    "close examination of all these entries revealed that 28 more stars could be matched together by assuming that one of the quoted coordinates ( either from the lhs or from the nltt ) had an error larger than @xmath33 . in all these cases ,",
    "the lhs and nltt entries have the same quoted proper motion , proper motion angle , and magnitude , but different quoted positions .",
    "we searched for those high proper motion stars in the dss at both quoted positions .",
    "we were able to recover all the high proper motion stars at one of the quoted positions , therefore identifying which ones were in error ( see table 1 ) . for 21 of the stars , it appears to be a simple transcription error affecting one digit or a sign , always in the declination column except for lhs3415/nltt47039 where the error in in the ra column .",
    "for the other 7 stars , there is a discrepancy @xmath34 in the declination which affects only nltt entries .    in the end , we were left with 4 lhs stars with @xmath14 yr@xmath2 for which we could not find any counterpart in the nltt and 25 nltt stars with @xmath14 yr@xmath2 for which we could not find any counterpart in the lhs .",
    "we verified the existence of all these objects by looking in dss fields at the quoted locations .",
    "we confirmed the existence of all 4 lhs stars which are missing from the nltt ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we also confirmed the existence of 22 on the nltt stars absent from the lhs , but were unable to recover nltt11999 , nltt22764 , and",
    "nltt46584 within @xmath33 of their quoted location .",
    "furthermore , we found that 4 of the recovered nltt stars had quoted proper motions overestimated by a factor 10 , and are actually stars with @xmath35 yr@xmath2 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "this means that 18 nltt stars with @xmath35 yr@xmath2 were actually omitted from the lhs catalog .",
    "overall , _",
    "the complete sample of @xmath35 yr@xmath2 stars compiled by luyten includes 3576 distinct objects_. we used this verified compilation of high proper motion luyten stars to match the stars found by superblink or listed in the tycho catalogs . within our survey area ( @xmath36 )",
    "there is a total of 674 stars from the luyten sample .",
    "we have cross - correlated all entries in the combined list of hpm stars that we generated from superblink and the tycho catalogs with the updated luyten master catalog reconstructed from the lhs and nltt .",
    "a first pass was made where we matched stars with positions similar to within @xmath37 .",
    "we made successive passes with gradual increases in the search radius , always requiring that matching objects have proper motions similar to within 10% and proper motion vectors similar to within @xmath38 .",
    "we found that 85% of the luyten stars in the area covered by our survey could be matched within 10@xmath6 of stars found by superblink ( see figure 3 ) . by increasing the search radius to 1@xmath25",
    ", we could match 665 of the luyten stars ( all but 9 of them ) .",
    "one more star was matched ( lhs6374 ) which we found at a distance of @xmath39 of the location quoted by luyten ( the matching star has a very similar magnitude and proper motion ) .",
    "we could not find any counterpart in our catalog for the remaining 9 stars ( see  5 below ) .",
    "figure 4 presents the complete results of our analysis .",
    "we use a color scheme to identify four classes of objects .",
    "black : hpm stars that were found in the tycho catalogs .",
    "blue : hpm stars found by superblink in the dss , and matched to previously known hpm stars , listed in the luyten catalogs .",
    "red : hpm stars listed in the luyten catalog which are not listed in the tycho catalogs and could not be recovered with superblink .",
    "green : hpm stars identified in the dss with superblink but that do not correspond to any entry in the luyten catalogs , i.e. newly discovered hpm stars .",
    "the histogram clearly illustrates the fact that the hipparcos satellite has only looked at the `` tip of the iceberg '' of hpm stars with @xmath40 yr@xmath2 , since the bulk of the stars are in the @xmath41 magnitude range .",
    "as expected , most of the new discoveries are at the faint end of the distribution .",
    "the 10 luyten stars that have been `` missed '' actually include 3 stars which have proper motions too large to be detected by superblink ( @xmath42 yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "three more `` missed '' luyten stars are close to the bright star limit for superblink , while also being below the completeness limit of the tycho catalog .",
    "based on these results , we have calculated the completeness of the tycho and luyten catalogs , and estimated the completeness of our own survey as a function of magnitude ; the results are displayed in figure 5 . to calculate the completeness of the tycho and luyten catalogs , we have simply divided , for each magnitude bin , the number of hpm stars found in those catalogs by the total number of hpm stars known ( those now listed in the present catalog , which include the new stars found by superblink ) . to estimate the completeness of our own survey , we calculated the recovery rate of luyten stars for each magnitude bin .",
    "we find that , at low galactic latitudes , the luyten catalog is complete only down to @xmath23=13 , and the completeness falls below 50% for stars fainter than @xmath23=15 .",
    "the tycho catalog is complete for hpm stars only down to @xmath43 and is very incomplete below @xmath27 .",
    "the tycho-2 catalog is thus a good complement to superblink , which is extremely efficient , but only for stars fainter than @xmath23=12 .",
    "note that the @xmath44 and @xmath45 bins give a 100% recovery rate but are based on the recovery of only 15 , and 6 luyten stars , respectively ( all of them recovered by superblink ) .",
    "while this is consistent with a very high efficiency for superblink , we can not exclude the possibility that the faint luyten stars , having been discovered with more limited methods , are simply the most obvious hpm stars to be found , and that more elusive objects have actually been missed by superblink .",
    "however , based on our recovery of nltt stars with proper motions in the range @xmath46 yr@xmath2 ( analysis in progress ) , we find that superblink is indeed highly efficient in finding hpm stars down to @xmath47 .",
    "although there appears to be a concentration of new stars at very low galactic latitudes ( @xmath48 ) some new stars have been discovered even at @xmath49 , which indicates that our analysis of higher galactic latitudes ( under way ) is likely to discover still more new faint hpm stars .",
    "we compare the red and blue magnitudes and color as quoted in the nltt and lhs catalogs ( the luyten - r and luyten - b magnitudes ) , and the magnitudes and colors estimated from our survey with the help of the gsc2.2.1 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath50 ) , to the magnitudes and colors of the same stars that are found in the tycho catalogs ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) .",
    "the tycho catalog magnitudes are accurate to about 0.1 mag , while photographic magnitudes are generally accurate to only 0.5 mags .",
    "we thus use the tycho magnitudes as a standard of reference to compare the accuracy of the luyten and poss - ii magnitudes .",
    "figure 6 reveals that the poss - ii magnitudes are significantly more accurate than the magnitudes estimated by luyten .",
    "it also shows that luyten - r , the `` red '' magnitude quoted in the luyten catalogs , is actually closer to a visual v magnitude ; luyten - b and luyten - r do match @xmath51 and @xmath52 relatively well .",
    "this warrants the use of the new poss - ii magnitudes as the reference for our updated catalog of hpm stars .",
    "figure 7 shows the generally good agreement between the luyten - r - luyten - b color and the tycho @xmath53 color , while there is a substantial difference between these two and the poss - ii @xmath50 color .",
    "the tycho @xmath51 and @xmath52 passbands are spaced further apart than johnson @xmath54 and @xmath55 ; there is a relationship @xmath56 .",
    "figure 7 also shows that there is an extremely large scatter in the color - color relationship between the luyten and poss - ii magnitude .",
    "since we have shown that the poss - ii magnitudes are more accurate than the luyten estimated magnitudes , we suggest that any classification based on the old luyten magnitudes should be revised .",
    "it is possible that _ stars suspected to be white dwarfs based on the luyten photometry may turn out to be red dwarfs and vice - versa_. we demonstrate this by reconstructing the reduced proper motion diagram for the luyten stars in the area covered by our survey .      the reduced proper motion @xmath57 is obtained by adding the logarithm of the proper motion to the apparent magnitude of the star ( luyten 1925 ) . because both the apparent magnitude and proper motions are a function of the distance to the star , the distance terms cancel , and one is left with a measure of the combined absolute magnitude and transverse velocity .",
    "the reduced proper motion can be defined in a specific passband e.g. : @xmath58 where @xmath23 and @xmath4 are the measured apparent magnitude and proper motion ( in @xmath6 yr@xmath2 ) and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the absolute magnitude and sky - projected velocity component ( in km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the reduced proper motion is useful when plotted against color , as it yields a diagram similar to the hertzprung - russel diagram , but with an additional scatter due to the @xmath61 term .",
    "stars of a given color with unusually large reduced proper motion either are intrinsically sub - luminous ( such as white dwarfs ) and/or have unusually large transverse velocities ( halo subdwarfs ) .",
    "the main use of the reduced proper motion diagram for faint stars is thus to separate out the white dwarfs and the high velocity stars from the local k and m dwarfs .",
    "we have built reduced proper motion / color diagrams for all the stars in our catalog for which we had luyten - r and luyten - b magnitudes and gsc2.2.1 @xmath23 and @xmath24 magnitudes .",
    "these essentially represent the subsample of old luyten stars which were faint enough that we could get poss - ii magnitudes ( brighter stars are saturated on the poss plates and their magnitudes are uncertain ) .",
    "this excludes from the sample most of the lhs and nltt stars observed by hipparcos .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is to compare the quality of the red and blue magnitudes quoted by luyten and those derived from the gsc2.2.1 .",
    "a comparison of the reduced proper motion diagrams attests to the generally higher quality of the poss - ii magnitudes ( see figure 8) .",
    "the scatter in color is smaller , and the white dwarf sequence ( to the lower left ) is better separated from the k - m dwarf sequence ( the bulk of the stars on the upper right ) .",
    "the better separation is achieved partly because of the higher quality of the color determination in the poss - ii data , but also because the @xmath50 color index spans a larger dynamic range than luyten - b - luyten - r ( since the luyten color is actually equivalent to a @xmath62 ) .",
    "the larger span in dynamic range insures that the red dwarfs are shifted more to the left of the diagram , where they are more easily separated from the bluer white dwarfs .",
    "a total of 9 stars listed in the luyten catalogs could not be found either in the tycho catalog or on the dss plates with superblink .",
    "three of the luyten stars for which we could not find a match ( lhs18 , lhs35 , lhs64 ) exceed the 2.0@xmath6 yr@xmath2 search limit of superblink , and are also not entered in the tycho-2 catalog . we manually recovered these stars by inspecting the dss fields in which they would be placed according to luyten s coordinates , and they were recovered at luyten s predicted positions .",
    "we also examined dss fields centered on the quoted location for the 6 other luyten stars which superblink failed to recover .",
    "we were able to visually identify 5 of the stars .",
    "three of these ( lhs223 , lhs464 , lhs3489 ) are relatively bright @xmath23=12 - 14 magnitude stars which are at the bright star limit of superblink and below the completeness limit of the tycho catalog .",
    "the other two stars ( lhs153 , lhs1103 ) are @xmath63 stars , normally within the detection range of superblink , but were missed for reasons that we have not fully explained yet .",
    "both objects lie close to brighter stars at one epoch , but superblink normally handles similar cases very well .",
    "one possibility we are currently investigating is that difficulty in handling the very different psf in the poss - i and poss - ii images for those specific objects might be the source of the problem .    the only lhs star which we were absolutely unable to recover , either with our software or by visual examination of the dss plates , is the very faint star lhs1657 , quoted by luyten as having a red magnitude r=19.0 and a blue magnitude b=21.0 .",
    "absolutely no star could be found at the location predicted by luyten , and visual examination of a @xmath64 field centered of the quoted position for this star failed to recover any hpm star at all .",
    "we conclude that , in all likeliness , this is a bogus entry in the lhs catalog ( the only one in our survey area ) .",
    "overall , we find that superblink achieves a recovery rate exceeding 99.5% for faint luyten stars .",
    "this suggests that not more that a handful of hpm stars have been missed by our software , at least down to @xmath23=19 .",
    "we have identified a total of 147 stars which did not match any entry from the luyten catalogs .",
    "six of those are close companions to luyten stars ( listed as single in the lhs and nltt ) identified with hipparcos , and listed in the tycho-2 catalog .",
    "the other 141 stars are entirely new objects discovered with superblink , and identified here for the first time .    we verified if any of the new stars found by supeblink could be a previously unreported common proper motion companion to a luyten star .",
    "we checked for the presence of luyten stars within @xmath65 of the new stars , with proper motion magnitudes within 5% .",
    "we discovered 2 new faint stars which are common proper motion companions to brighter luyten stars ( see  7 below ) .",
    "the names , coordinates , and magnitudes of the 141 stars are listed in table 4 .",
    "we give the estimated coordinates of the stars for the epoch 2000.0 , which we extrapolated from the measured position on the poss - ii with the estimated proper motion vector . the magnitude @xmath66 of the proper motion , and the direction of the proper motion vector ( proper motion angle , or @xmath67 )",
    "are also given in the table .",
    "we give the estimated values of the red and blue magnitudes ( @xmath24 and @xmath23 ) in the poss - ii system . we are quoting the r and b magnitudes from the gsc2.2.1 for all those stars for which we were able to obtain a match .",
    "for all other stars ( mainly stars with @xmath68 ) we estimated the magnitudes ourselves from the integrated plate flux .",
    "we could not obtain an estimate of the b magnitude for several of the faintest stars ; these were too faint on the blue plates and often did not have any observable blue counterpart .",
    "all the quoted magnitudes are accurate to @xmath69 .",
    "finding charts for all 141 stars are presented in the appendix .",
    "the distribution of new and old stars with galactic latitude is shown in figure 9 , for stars in the range @xmath70 ( moderately faint ) and @xmath71 ( faint ) .",
    "the luyten survey was virtually complete for bright stars ( @xmath72 ) . a significant number of moderately faint stars were missing at low galactic latitudes ; most of the new moderately faint hpm stars were found within 15@xmath15 of the plane . on the other hand ,",
    "luyten s census of faint hpm stars was significantly incomplete , even at relatively high galactic latitudes ( @xmath73 ) , and listed only a handful of objects within @xmath38 of the galactic plane .",
    "it remains to be verified whether significant numbers of faint hpm stars can be discovered at higher galactic latitudes ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the distribution with galactic latitude of the updated census of hpm stars is now consistent with a uniform distribution , which suggests that the survey is now complete , at least down to r=19 .",
    "we have discovered an r=17 star lsr0013 + 5437 located 343@xmath6 to the southeast of the r=13 star lsr0012 + 5439 ( = lhs1039 ) . both stars have a proper motion @xmath75 yr@xmath2 , with a proper motion angle @xmath76 .",
    "the primary star , also known as g217 - 38 ( see giclas , burnham , & thomas 1971 ) , is a suspected m dwarf with no published spectrum or spectroscopically determined spectral type .",
    "a parallax of @xmath77 for lhs1039 has been measured by harrington & dahn ( 1980 ) , which suggest the star is at a distance @xmath78pc . at that distance ,",
    "the projected separation between the components is @xmath79au .",
    "we have discovered an r=16 star lsr0401 + 5131 located 495@xmath6 to the north of the r=12 star lsr0401 + 5123 ( = lhs1618 ) .",
    "both stars have a proper motion @xmath80 yr@xmath2 , with a proper motion angle @xmath81 .",
    "the star lhs1618 has been spectroscopically observed and classified m3.5 by reid , hawley , & gizis ( 1995 ) .",

    "<S> we have conducted a systematic search for high proper motion stars in the digitized sky survey , in the area of the sky north of -2.8 degrees in declination and within 25 degrees of the galactic plane . using the superblink software , a powerful automated blink comparator developed by us , </S>",
    "<S> we have identified 601 stars in the magnitude range @xmath0 with proper motions in the range @xmath1 arcsec yr@xmath2 which have not been observed with the hipparcos satellite . among those </S>",
    "<S> , we recovered 460 stars previously listed in luyten s proper motion catalogs ( lhs , nltt ) , and discovered 141 new high proper motion stars , ranging in magnitude from r=13.0 to r=19.8 . </S>",
    "<S> only 9 stars from the luyten catalogs that were not observed by hipparcos could not be recovered with superblink : 3 had proper motions larger than the search limit of the code ( @xmath3 ) , and 5 were missed because they were either too bright for superblink to handle or they are in the immediate proximity of very bright stars </S>",
    "<S> . only one of luyten s stars ( lhs1657 ) could not be recovered at all , even by visual inspection of the poss plates , and is now suspected to be bogus . </S>",
    "<S> the very high success rate in the recovery by superblink of faint luyten stars suggests that our new survey of high proper motion stars is at least 99% complete for stars with proper motions @xmath1 arcsec yr@xmath2 down to r=19 . </S>",
    "<S> this paper includes a list of positions , proper motions , magnitudes , and finder charts for all the new high proper motion stars . </S>"
