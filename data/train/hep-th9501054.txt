    "( because of this the area of the torus is characterized by planck s constant which takes on the values @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of sites in both the coordinate and the momentum directions in the phase space . ) from time step @xmath6 to @xmath7 it is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 guarantees area preservation .",
    "the degree of chaos depends on the choice of @xmath0 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath0 are either both real or both imaginary . in the latter case , @xmath0 is elliptic , the motion becomes periodic and no sensitive dependence on the initial condition is observed .",
    "when @xmath0 is hyperbolic , the motion is chaotic .",
    "quantized cat map is studied in detail by hannay and berry @xcite .",
    "the matrix has to assume a special form in order to yield nontrivial values of the progagator for the map .",
    "we choose @xmath10 for the elliptic and the hyperbolic cases respectively .",
    "for the special choice of the matrix elements @xmath11 made above the propagator takes on the simple forms , @xmath12 , ~~ u_2(j+1 , j ) = \\sqrt{\\frac{i}{\\cal n}}\\exp [ \\frac{i}{\\hbar } ( q_{j}^{2}- q_{j}q_{j+1}+q_{j+1}^{2})].\\ ] ] since each iteration describes a permutation among sites , each site belongs to a periodic orbit .",
    "thus the quantum dynamics follows the classical way , resulting in the recurrence of the wave function ( or equivalently , the wigner function @xcite ) .",
    "we now couple the system linearly to a bath of @xmath13 harmonic oscillators with coordinates @xmath14 and momentum @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath2 is the coordinate of the system and @xmath20 is the coupling constant of @xmath2 to the @xmath21th oscillator in the bath . by integrating out the bath variables , we get the reduced density matrix , @xmath22.\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the classical action of the system which appears as the exponent of the propagator in ( 1.3 ) .",

    "is divided by a finite number of different periodic orbits and the period is known to increase roughly proportional to @xmath5 with some irregular oscillation . when coupled to a bath",
    ", the cat map is exposed to a gaussian noise in each time step .",
    "the discretized noise induces transitions between different periodic orbits in an irregular way .",
    "interaction with an environment blurs the recurrence of physical quantities in the quantum map .",
    "fig.1 shows @xmath48 , the linearized entropy ( with the reversed sign ) for various cases .",
    "if there is no interaction with the environment , the entropy is constant for both regular and chaotic cases .",
    "quantum recurrence is evident even when the system is chaotic .",
    "when interaction sets in , @xmath48 decays exponentially , showing that the system rapidly decoheres .",
    "the rate of decoherence is much faster in chaotic systems than in regular systems @xcite .",
    "it suggests that recurrence would be less evident in a decohering chaotic system . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the mean displacement of points in the phase space as a function of time steps . this is defined by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the displacements from the initial phase space points , and @xmath52 denotes averaging over noise distributions . in the chaotic case , we see that recurrence disappears with just a small amount of noise ( fig .",
    "2a ) whereas in the regular case , the same amount of noise does not alter the qualitative picture of recurrence ( fig .",
    "2b ) . in both cases ,",
    "the decohered quantum system behaves close to the classical picture in which the regular and chaotic dynamics are clearly distinguished . in spite of the discreteness of the points on the torus",
    ", the system behaves effectively classically due to the influence of the environment .",
    "the kicked rotor is one of the most intensively studied models from both the quantum and classical point of view @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the kicked rotor is given by @xmath53 which describes a one - dimensional rotor subjected to a delta - functional periodic kick at @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 is the angle of the rotor with period @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the moment of inertia , @xmath42 is the angular momentum , and @xmath44 is the strength of the kick which measures the nonlinearity . when @xmath58 , the system becomes chaotic over the entire phase space .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the kicked rotor is given by the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the wave function of the rotor .    denoting @xmath61 as the wave function @xmath62 at each discrete time @xmath63 , and integrating ( 2.2 ) from @xmath6 to @xmath7",
    ", we obtain @xmath64   \\exp [ -i \\frac{k\\cos x}{\\hbar } ]   \\psi_{j}(x ) \\ ] ]    the quantum kicked rotor ( qkr ) is known to exhibit dynamical localization . after some relaxation time scale ,",
    "the wave function becomes exponentially localized in the momentum space @xcite .",
    "this may be interpreted as a particle moving in a lattice with a quasi - random potential .",
    "this heuristic picture seems to justify the analogy between the quantum kicked rotor to the tight binding model with an exponentially decaying hopping parameter which is known to show anderson localization @xcite .",
    "dynamical localization in this context arises from the suppression of classical diffusive behavior by the quantum dynamics .",
    "however , as shown by ott , et.al .",
    "@xcite , a small external noise can break the localization",
    ". sufficient amount of noise would induce the quantum system to exhibit classical diffusive behavior .",
    "dittrich and graham studied this problem @xcite by coupling the system to a zero temperature harmonic oscillator bath and analysed solutions to the master equation .",
    "cohen and fishman presented the most detailed study of this problem for an ohmic bath @xcite . here we want to approach these issues from an environment - induced decoherence point of view @xcite .",
    "we begin by calculating the density matrix for the kicked rotor coupled to an environment .",
    "we introduce a linear coupling of the system momentum @xmath42 with each oscillator coordinate @xmath65 in the bath in the form @xmath66 ( here @xmath67 without the subscript @xmath21 denote the system coordinate and momentum variables ) . as before",
    ", we assume an ohmic bath and examine the time period where dissipation is small . under these assumptions ,",
    "the unit time propagator for the wave function @xmath68 is given by @xmath69      \\exp [ -\\frac{i}{\\hbar }   k\\cos x ]      \\exp [ -\\frac{i}{\\hbar }   \\xi p ] \\ ] ] where , as before , the noise term @xmath70 arises from using a gaussian identity in the integral transform of the term involving the noise kernel in the influence functional .",
    "summing over all noise realizations @xmath71 gives the desired reduced density matrix , @xmath72 where @xmath73    loss of quantum coherence is measured by the density matrix becoming approximately diagonal .",
    "@xmath48 can be expressed as @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the statistical average of all possible noise histories of two independent noises @xmath76 defined at each time interval from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath77 are reduced to two time - uncorrelated independent gaussian white noises defined at each time step .",
    "we see that there is a close relation between the breaking of dynamical localization and quantum decoherence .",
    "in fig.3 we plot the linearized entropy @xmath48 versus the energy @xmath78 .",
    "this shows that delocalization occurs as quantum coherence breaks down , suggesting that delocalization and decoherence occurs by the same mechanism",
    ". as the nonlinearity parameter @xmath44 increases , the system decoheres more rapidly . at the same time , the amount of delocalization measured by the diffusion constant increases .",
    "this may be explained in the following way : because the coupling is through the momentum , the noise term does not involve any nonlinearity .",
    "the time scale for the system to lose coherence is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the thermal de broglie wavelength , and @xmath81 is the relevant momentum scale .",
    "after this time , noise will destroy the quantum coherence between such momentum separations . in the kicked rotor case",
    ", localization will occur due to the coherence around @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the localization length . since @xmath84 , this gives @xmath85 .",
    "this shows that nonlinearity increases the rate of decoherence .",
    "the relation between the diffusion constant @xmath86 and the noise strength is given in @xcite .",
    "for our case , @xmath87 and for weak noises , we can consider the particle as undergoing a random walk with hopping parameter @xmath88 .",
    "then @xmath89 .",
    "the wigner function is often used to examine the quantum to classical transition . the wigner function at time @xmath54 is defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91 . from ( 2.3 ) , the unit - time propagator for the wigner function of the qkr is found to be @xmath92 where @xmath93 measures the effect of the kick .",
    "we can see the effects of quantum corrections is seen more clearly if we expand @xmath94 in orders of @xmath95 : @xmath96 the first exponential contains the classical propagator and the second contains quantum corrections of even orders of @xmath95 .",
    "thus we get @xmath97 where the wigner function with the new arguments depicts classical evolution .",
    "this map alone is the source of streching and folding of volume in phase space which signify classical chaos .",
    "if the initial system wavefunction is described by a gaussian wave packet with width @xmath98 , we would expect to see a classical - like evolution of the packet at short times .",
    "when the width of the contracting wave packet gets so small as comparable to @xmath95 , the effect of quantum corrections from higher @xmath95 order terms in ( 3.4 ) set in . by comparing the classical and quantum terms",
    ", we see that quantum corrections will become important when @xmath99 . here",
    "@xmath100 , where the lyapunov exponent @xmath101 .",
    "thus we can deduce the ehrenfest time when the wigner function or the expectation value of any observable follow classical trajectories .",
    "] for qkr to be @xmath102 note that in the continuum case , this definition gives us a different time scale for each term in the expansion @xcite .",
    "the major effect of the bath ( at times short compared with the relaxation time ) is the appearance of a diffusion term in ( 3.4 ) , @xmath103 competition amongst the three terms with different physical origins is apparent : the first term in ( 3.5 ) is the quantum diffusion term , the second is the quantum correction term , and the third is purely classical evolution . as discussed by zurek and paz @xcite ,",
    "if d is sufficiently large , the effect of quantum corrections becomes inconspicuous . in this case",
    ", the diffusion term traces out a small scale oscillating behavior before quantum corrections have a chance to change classical evolution .",
    "then one may expect the time evolution of the wigner function to be like that of classical evolution with noise .",
    "the role of quantum diffusion is to add some gaussian averaging so that the contracting direction in phase space will be suppressed while it does not affect the stretching direction .",
    "as long as the width of the wave packet is large such that the first term is negligible , the evolution should be liouvillian ( time reversible if we assume infinite measurement precision ) .",
    "furthermore , we expect that after the width of the packet along the contracting direction becomes comparable to the diffusion generated width ( in the gaussian wave packet ) , the dynamics will start showing irreversible behavior arising from coarse graining ( as distict from irrreversibility from instability ) .",
    "consequently , entropy should increase in this regime . in fig .",
    "4a , we plot the von neumann entropy for the dynamics of ( 3.5 ) .",
    "we can see three qualitatively different regimes : i. the liouville regime : the entropy is constant and the dynamics is time reversible .",
    "the decohering regime : the entropy keeps increasing due to coarse graining .",
    "the finite size regime : due to the bounded nature of the phase space , the entropy shows saturation . our result from quantitative analysis seems to confirm the qualitative description of zurek and paz @xcite who used the inverted harmonic oscillator potential as a generic source of instability . since the phase space in their model",
    "is not bounded they do not see regime iii .",
    "similar features appear in the quantum cap map ( fig .",
    "4b ) in this case , the full quantum dynamics can be calculated in a simple way .",
    "resemblance with the result of a classical rotor with noise is obvious .",
    "however , in this case , the stable entropy is smaller than the maximum value which may be explained as a finite ( phase space ) size effect .",

    "if there is no environment , the entropy is constant for both hyperbolic and elliptic cases , indicating the purity of the state . for the hyperbolic map , even though classically this system is strongly chaotic , the corresponding quantum system does not show chaotic behavior .",
