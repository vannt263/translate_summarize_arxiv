    "in their earliest classification of the @xmath13batse catalog @xcite , all grbs have been classified in short and long bursts being their @xmath14 duration longer or shorter than @xmath15 s @xcite . in the meantime",
    ", short bursts have been shown to originate from a variety of astrophysical origins and not form a homogeneous class . in the fireshell model @xcite",
    ", the canonical grb has two components : an emission occurring at the transparency of the optically thick expanding @xmath0-baryon plasma @xcite , the proper - grb ( p - grb ) , followed by the extended afterglow , due to the interactions between the accelerated baryons and the circumburst medium ( cbm ) .",
    "such an extended afterglow comprises the prompt emission as well as the late phase of the afterglow @xcite .",
    "the relative energy of these two components , for a given total energy of the plasma @xmath16 , is uniquely a function of the baryon load @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the total baryons mass ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , upper panel ) .",
    "the genuine short grbs @xcite are the bursts occurring for @xmath19 .",
    "the first example of such systems has indeed been recently identified , originating in a binary neutron star merger @xcite .",
    "it has been also proved the existence of disguised short grbs , with baryon load @xmath20 @xcite . in this class",
    "the extended afterglow is indeed energetically predominant but results in a `` deflated '' emission , less intense than the p - grb , due to the low density of the cbm , @xmath21 particle/@xmath6 , much lower than the canonical value @xmath9 particle/@xmath6 .",
    "the majority of the declared short bursts in the current literature appears to be disguised short grbs @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show a yet different kind of a disguised short , grb 090510 , again , with @xmath20 and lorentz factor @xmath22 , occurring in a medium with @xmath23 particles/@xmath6 .",
    "we define , indeed , these grbs as `` disguised short burst by excess '' , being their @xmath24 much larger than the canonical one . correspondingly , we indicate the disguised short with a cbm density typical of the galactic halo environments , @xmath21 particles/@xmath6 , as `` disguised short grbs by defect '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the possibility of grbs exploding in high density cbm has been already considered in literature @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the high density has been inferred from the steepening in the afterglows , respectively , of grb 990123 in the @xmath25-band about @xmath26 days after the burst , of grb 000926 in the @xmath25-band after @xmath27 days , and of grb 990705 in the @xmath28-band after @xmath29 day , due to the transition to the nonrelativistic regime of the fireball . @xcite",
    "discuss the possibility that the detection of fe lines in the afterglows of grb 970508 and grb 970828 could be due to recombination processes in extremely high densities during the x - ray afterglow . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors inferred dense environments , @xmath30 particles/@xmath6 , from a survey for absorption in grbs afterglow spectra .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the fireshell model has been applied in the analysis of grb 970828 , discussed also in @xcite , inferring a dense environment with @xmath31 particle/@xmath6 , consistent with the large column density environment in @xcite . in the case of grb 090510 the joint effect of the very dense cbm and the high lorentz factor at the transparency , @xmath32 , leads to an extended afterglow with @xmath33 s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "these high values of the cbm density @xmath34 and of the lorentz factor @xmath12 may represent an important step towards the explanation of the gev emission .",

    "[ sec2 ] we present the data analysis of grb 090510 ; in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we give our theoretical interpretation on the source ; in sec .  [ sec4 ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "at 00:22:59.97 ut on 10@xmath35 may 2009 , the fermi - gbm detector @xcite triggered and located the short and bright burst , grb 090510 , which was also detected by swift @xcite , fermi - lat @xcite , agile @xcite , konus - wind @xcite , and suzaku - wam @xcite .",
    "optical observations by vlt / fors2 located the host galaxy of grb 090510 at the redshift of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the offset with respect to the nordic optical telescope refined afterglow position @xcite corresponds to @xmath37 kpc .",
    "we have analyzed the fermi - gbm data from nai - n6 ( @xmath38  @xmath39 kev ) and bgo - b1 ( @xmath40 kev ",

    "the light curve of grb 090510 is composed of two different episodes , @xmath44 s apart .",
    "the first episode , from @xmath45 s to @xmath46 s ( in the following @xmath47 ; @xmath48 is the trigger time ) , has not been considered by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite because of the small content of detected photons . even though the statistical content of this first episode is very poor , in this letter",
    "we show its great relevance for the theoretical analysis , since it can be identified with the p - grb .",
    "the second episode can be interpreted as the extended afterglow . in the statistical analysis of the first episode ,",
    "we have considered power - law ( pl ) , black body ( bb ) plus pl , band @xcite , comptonized ( compt ) , band+bb and compt+bb models . following the statistical analysis for nested models by @xcite ,",
    "models more complicated than the simplest band and compt are singled out ( see the last column of tab .  [ sign ] ) .",
    "the direct statistical comparison between bb+pl and pl models gives a significance level of @xmath49 ( see tab .",
    "[ sign ] ) .",
    "this means that the bb+pl model improves the fit of the data of the first episode with respect to the pl model , which is excluded at @xmath50 confidence level .",
    "the simple band model has an unconstrained @xmath51 index and a large error on the energy peak @xmath52 , as well as in the case of the compt model , for which the total flux is underestimated with respect to the band and bb+pl models .",
    "the quality of data does not allow us to favor the bb+pl model versus the compt one from a pure statistical analysis . in order to clarify such a fundamental issue ,",
    "it is appropriate that future space missions with larger collecting area and x/@xmath53-rays timing be flown in the near future ( see e.g. loft mission , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from our theoretical interpretation the bb+pl ,",

[ fig:2 ] , bottom right panel , and table below ) , we have interpreted this emission as the extended afterglow . using the above values of @xmath16 and @xmath61 , we have simulated the light curve of the extended afterglow by defining the radial number density distribution of the cbm ( assuming spherically distributed clouds ) and the value of the filling factor @xmath62 , following a trial and error procedure to reproduce the pulses observed in the light curve and the corresponding spectrum .",

    "\\2 ) we have stressed a key difference between the fireshell and the fireball approaches . in the fireshell model the extended afterglow encompasses the prompt emission and the afterglow of the traditional fireball model .",
    "the density of the cbm is inferred from the prompt emission by assuming the fully radiative condition emission in a optically thin regime @xcite and a precise spectrum in the comoving frame is assumed @xcite and convoluted over the equitemporal surfaces ( eqts , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the fireball model , instead",
    ", the density is estimated from the afterglow emission by analyzing emission or absorption lines in the x - ray spectra ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . from the fully radiative condition",
    ", we have found that grb 090510 occurs in an over - dense medium with an average value of @xmath23 particles/@xmath6 ( for spherically symmetric distributed clouds ) . this high cbm density and",
    "the small value of the filling factor , @xmath7 , leads to local over - dense cbm clouds , in the form of filaments , bubbles and clumps , with a range of densities @xmath8 particles/@xmath6 .",
    "\\3 ) the joint effect of the high value of the lorentz factor , @xmath3 , and the high density compresses in time the emission of the extended afterglow .",
    "therefore its light curve is shortened in time and `` inflated '' in intensity with respect to the canonical one for disguised short bursts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , lower panel ) , making it apparently closer to the genuine short class of grbs @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this grb , with an abnormally high value of the cbm density , the extended afterglow does not fulfill the amati relation @xcite .",
