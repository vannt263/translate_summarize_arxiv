    "in the last few years , complex networks have become a new paradigm for complexity .",
    "the merging of graph theory together with new and classical statistical physics tools has lead to the development of a modern theory of complex network @xcite , that has found fruitful applications in domains as divers as technology ( the physical internet @xcite , the world - wide web @xcite , power grids @xcite ) , biology ( protein - protein interaction networks @xcite , metabolic networks @xcite , foodwebs @xcite ) , social sciences ( sexual contact networks @xcite , friendship networks @xcite , scientific collaboration networks @xcite ) , etc .",
    "the statistical analysis of many `` real - world '' networks has shown that most of these systems seem to share some typical features , the most relevant of them being the small - world property @xcite and a large connectivity heterogeneity , reflected in the presence of a scale - free degree distribution @xcite .",
    "the small - world property refers to the fact that , in real networks , the hop distance between two randomly chosen elements of the system is very small if compared to the total number of elements .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath2 is the average distance between two elements ( or vertices ) , measured as the smallest number of connections ( or edges ) between any vertices , and @xmath3 is the system size ( number of vertices ) then , usually @xmath4 increases logarithmically or slower with @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "scale - free networks are characterized by a degree distribution @xmath5 , defined as the probability that a randomly selected vertex is connected to @xmath6 other vertices ( has degree @xmath6 ) , that decreases as a power - law , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a characteristic degree exponent , usually in the range @xmath9 .",
    "for these values of the degree exponent , the fluctuations in the degree distribution , measured by the second moment @xmath10 , diverge in the infinite network size limit , @xmath11 , giving rise a very heterogeneous connectivity lacking any characteristic degree scale .",
    "this behavior is in opposition to the more classical homogeneous networks @xcite , which have a degree distribution decaying exponentially or faster and exhibit bounded degree fluctuations .    given that complex networks are widespread in nature , it becomes a quite interesting issue the characterization of the effects that their complex topology can have on dynamical processes taking place on top of these systems .",
    "for example , it has been shown that heterogeneous networks are remarkably weak in front of targeted attacks , aimed at destroying the most connected vertices @xcite , as well as to the propagation of infective agents @xcite .",
    "these properties , which are mainly due to the critical interplay between topology and dynamics in heterogeneous networks , are otherwise absent in their homogeneous counterparts .",
    "epidemic processes , chemical reactions , and many other dynamic processes , can all be modeled in terms of reaction - diffusion processes @xcite .",
    "these are dynamic systems that involve particles of different `` species '' ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) that diffuse stochastically and interact among them following a fixed set of reaction rules .",
    "one s interest is usually focused on the time evolution and steady states of the densities of the different species @xmath14 , and the possible presence of critical phase transitions @xcite . while much is known about the behavior of reaction - diffusion processes on regular homogeneous lattices ,",
    "the situation is not so well established in what respects the possible effects that a heterogeneous connectivity structure can have on them . at this respect , it is interesting the work presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a numerical simulation analysis of the diffusion - annihilation process @xmath0 @xcite , was performed on scale - free networks . in this reaction - diffusion process , particles of a single species @xmath1 diffuse on the vertices of a network and annihilate upon contact ( when two @xmath1 particles fall on the same vertex ) . in regular lattices of euclidean dimension @xmath15",
    ", it is well known that the local density of @xmath1 particles , @xmath16 , is ruled by a langevin equation @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an uncorrelated gaussian noise .",
    "dynamical renormalization group arguments allow to show that the average density of @xmath1 particles , @xmath19 , behaves in the large time limit as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the initial particle density , and the exponent @xmath22 takes the values @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the critical dimension of this process . for @xmath28 one",

    "@xcite , performed in scale - free networks with general degree exponent @xmath8 , generated using the configuration model @xcite , led the authors to conclude that the behavior in time of the average density of @xmath1 particles can be approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) , where the asymptotic exponent @xmath22 is a decreasing function of @xmath8 and is surprisingly larger than @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the authors attributed this effect to the small - world nature of the networks , and to the existence of hubs ( vertices with a large number of connections ) .    in spite of the potential interest of this result",
    ", no theoretical arguments have been proposed so far to back up the numerical conclusions reached in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we tackle this task , by developing a mean - field analysis of the @xmath0 process .",
    "this analysis , made in the continuous @xmath6 approximation and inspired in previous works made for epidemic spreading @xcite , results in a set of differential equations for the density of @xmath1 particles in the vertices of degree @xmath6 , which are valid for networks with arbitrary degree distribution @xmath5 and two vertex correlations @xcite , determined by the conditional probability @xmath32 that a vertex of degree @xmath6 is connected to a vertex of degree @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the solution of these equations for the particular case of uncorrelated networks ( in which the conditional probability @xmath32 is independent of @xmath6 ) shows that , while homogeneous networks display a pure mean - field behavior with exponent @xmath25 , scale - free networks with @xmath31 in the infinite size limit exhibit instead an exponent depending on the properties of the network , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "remarkably , this solution in the infinite size limit shows a crossover for any finite network to a linear behavior @xmath35 , with a slope depending on the network size .",

    "each vertex in the network can host at most one @xmath1 particle , and the dynamics of the process is defined as follows : each particle jumps at a certain rate @xmath43 to a randomly chosen nearest neighbor .",

    "( [ eq:4 ] ) , we perform a _ quasi - static _ approximation in the rate equation eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) . from the mean - field solution of the @xmath0 process",
    ", we expect @xmath75 to be a decreasing function with a power law - like behavior . in this case , for large enough times , the time derivative of @xmath75 will be much smaller that the density proper . extending this argument to the partial densities @xmath44 ,",
    "at large times we can neglect the left - hand - side term in eq.([eq:3 ] ) , and solve for @xmath44 as a function of the density , obtaining @xmath76 substituting this approximation into the expression for @xmath77 , we get @xmath78 inserting this last expression into eq .  ( [ eq:4 ] ) , we obtain as a final equation for the density of @xmath1 particles @xmath79    the solution of the approximate equation eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) will depend on the particular form of the degree distribution .",
    "the task becomes , however , quite simple for the class of homogeneous networks . in this case , the degree distribution decreases so quickly that all its moments are finite .",
    "so , for small @xmath75 we can perform a taylor expansion of the right - hand - side of eq .  ( [ eq:7 ] ) , obtaining at lowest order @xmath80 whose solution at large times yields @xmath81 being @xmath21 the initial density of @xmath1 particles .",
    "this corresponds to the pure mean - field linear behavior , with a finite prefactor depending on the second moment of the degree distribution .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) can help us to understand how this process will operate in heterogeneous networks .",
    "indeed , for any given time @xmath82 , the partial density of vertices with degree larger than @xmath83 is essentially constant up to time @xmath82 , that is , @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the reason is that vertices with high degree ( hubs ) are more easily reached by particles than those with small degree and , with high probability they will be surrounded by some @xmath1 particle .",
    "then , as soon as one nearby particle decides to move to the hub , both particles disappear and another nearby particle will replace the original one in the hub , keeping then the density constant , which is clearly set to @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , hubs act as drains through which particles vanish .",
    "besides , this process happens in a hierarchical way in time , that is , the partial density of small degree vertices decreases first , whereas the most connected vertices are the last to hold particles .",
    "this reasoning allows us to anticipate that the resulting dynamics will strongly depend on the number of high degree vertices of the network and , consequently , on the degree distribution .",
    "for heterogenous networks with a diverging second moment , as in the case of scale - free networks , we have to consider more carefully the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "let us focus in generalized uncorrelated scale - free networks in the infinite size limit , which are completely determined by the normalized degree distribution @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the degree exponent , @xmath90 is the minimum degree in the network , and we are approximating @xmath6 as a continuous variable .",
    "the average degree is thus @xmath91 . for a scale - free network in the limit @xmath11 ,",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) can be written as @xmath92     & = & - \\rho(t ) f\\left(1 , \\gamma-2 , \\gamma-1 , -\\frac{(\\gamma-1)}{2(\\gamma-2)\\rho(t)}\\right ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the gauss hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "therefore , the density as function of time can be implicitly expressed in terms of the integral @xmath94 for very large times and small densities , we can use the asymptotic expansion of the gauss hypergeometric function , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , to obtain the scaling behavior of the density with time , @xmath97 this same result can be derived in a more intuitive fashion starting from the argument presented at the end of the previous section .",
    "if hubs act as drains of particles , then the rate of change in the total density of particles will be proportional to the density of hubs .",
    "more precisely , identifying the relevant hubs at time @xmath45 as those vertices with degree larger than @xmath98 , we have that @xmath99 from where we obtain the same trend given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) . as @xmath8 decreases the probability of having high degree vertices as drains in the network increases .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) we see as well that when this happens , the decrease in the density gets faster .",
    "therefore , the bigger is the degree of the hubs in the network , the faster is the process of annihilation .",
    "we can obtain an exact solution for @xmath75 in scale - free networks with degree exponent @xmath100 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the differential equation for the particle density reads now @xmath103 whose solution is @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the logarithmic integral function @xcite . for small @xmath75",
    ", we can exploit the asymptotic expansion of the logarithmic integral function , @xmath106 , @xmath96 , to obtain @xmath107 that is , in the infinite network size limit , the particle density of a scale - free network with @xmath100 follows the same decay as the mean - field solution , with a logarithmic correction .",
    "the conclusion of this analysis is that the particle density in the @xmath0 process in a infinite size scale - free network with degree exponent @xmath8 follows the asymptotic form at large times @xmath108 with characteristic exponents @xmath109 the results for @xmath110 are a natural consequence of the lack of degree fluctuations ( @xmath111 ) in this kind of scale - free networks .",
    "the analytical exponents determined above , however , are strongly affected by finite size effects . indeed , for a power - law degree distribution , the largest weight in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) is carried by the large @xmath6 values . if the network is composed by a finite number of vertices , @xmath3 , as it always happens in numerical simulations , it has a cut - off or maximum degree @xmath112 , which is usually a function of the network size @xcite",
    ". thus , there exists a cross - over time @xmath113 , defined by @xmath114 such that , for @xmath115 the particle density is so small that we can approximate @xmath116 in this time regime , we will observe an effective linear behavior for the inverse particle density , @xmath117 whose effective slope depends of the network size as @xmath118 that is , in finite size scale - free networks , the density of @xmath1 particles at very large times has the same behavior as in homogeneous networks , i.e. @xmath119 is linear in @xmath45 , but now with a slope that depends on the network size @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the exponents larger than one , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) , can only be numerically observed as transients in very large networks .",
    "as a check for the analytic predictions developed in the previous sections , we have performed extensive numerical simulations of the diffusion - annihilation process on top of different model networks , both homogeneous and heterogeneous .",
    "the simulations are implemented using a sequential updating scheme @xcite .",
    "an initial fraction @xmath120 of vertices in the networks is randomly chosen and occupied by an @xmath1 particle . at time @xmath45 in the simulation , a vertex is randomly chosen among the @xmath121 vertices that host an @xmath1 particle at that time .",
    "one of its neighbors is selected also at random . if it is empty , the particle moves and occupies it .",
    "if it contains a particle , this is annihilated with the one in the first vertex , becoming both vertices empty , and the number of occupied vertices is updated @xmath122 . in both cases , time is updated as @xmath123 , where @xmath121 is the total number of particles at the beginning of the simulation step . in all the simulations presented in this section , we set the initial particle density @xmath124 .",
    "the class of homogeneous networks refers to networks with a degree distribution peaked at an average value @xmath125 and decaying exponentially or faster for @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "typical examples of such networks are the erds and rnyi model @xcite and the small - world model proposed by watts and strogatz ( ws ) @xcite .",
    "we will focus in the latter in order to perform computer simulations .",
    "the ws model is defined as follows @xcite : the starting point is a ring with @xmath3 vertices , in which every vertex is symmetrically connected to its @xmath128 nearest neighbors .",
    "then , for every vertex , each edge connected to a clockwise neighbor is rewired to a randomly chosen vertex with probability @xmath129 , and preserved with probability @xmath130 .",
    "this procedure generates a graph with a degree distribution that decays faster than exponentially for large @xmath6 , and average degree @xmath102 .",
    "we will consider the ws model with @xmath131 , that is , in which all edges have been rewired . in this limit",
    ", the degree distribution of the ws network takes the form @xcite @xmath132 therefore , all its moments @xmath133 are finite for any value of @xmath121 , and we should expect eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) to provide a good approximation for the dynamics of the @xmath0 process for @xmath134 .",
    "in order to check this fact , we have carried out large scale numerical simulations of the @xmath0 reaction on ws networks with @xmath131 and minimum degree @xmath135 , which corresponds to an average degree @xmath136 .",

    "[ fig : wsdensity ] we show the total density of @xmath1 particles as a function of time .",
    "as we can observe , the inverse particle density follows quite precisely a linear behavior with time .",
    "a linear fit for the last two decades of @xmath45 values yields a slope @xmath140 , which is not too different from the predicted value in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) , @xmath141 .",
    "the barabsi - albert ( ba ) graph was introduced as the first growing network model capable of producing as an emerging property a power - law degree distribution @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the preferential attachment paradigm , a rather intuitive mechanism in which new individuals tend to develop more easily connections with already well connected individuals .",

    "after iterating this procedure a large number of times , we obtain a network composed by @xmath3 vertices , minimum degree @xmath90 , and average degree @xmath102 , with a degree distribution @xmath145 and almost vanishing degree correlations @xcite .",

    "we observe instead that , in the infinite network size limit @xmath11 , the inverse particle density increases as a power law with time , @xmath165 , with an exponent larger than one and that depends on the level of heterogeneity of the network , i.e. @xmath166 for @xmath31 . for @xmath100 , a linear growth with logarithmic corrections sets in , while for @xmath110 we recover again the mean - field solution typical of homogeneous networks . in the case of scale - free networks , we have also analyzed the effects of a finite network size in this dynamical process . for any value of @xmath167 , we have shown that , at large times , the inverse particle density in a finite network crosses over to a linear behavior , with a slope that is an increasing function of the network size @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath168 . in order to check our results , we have performed extensive numerical simulations on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks , obtaining a convincing evidence for our predictions .    an interesting conclusion that can be extracted of the present work is the very strong incidence that finite size effects can have on dynamical systems on top of scale - free networks . while these size effects have been already discussed in the context of epidemic spreading @xcite",
    ", the @xmath0 process analyzed here provides a further example , in which analytical results and numerical simulations show a striking agreement .",
