    "the measurement of heavy quarkonia ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath7 , etc ) is considered as one of the most promising probes of the formed medium at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "the force between the constituents of a quarkonium state , a heavy quark and its antiquark , is weakened by the color screening produced by the light quarks and gluons  @xcite . accordingly",
    "the quarkonium yields are expected to suppress in @xmath8 collisions compared to those in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "recent calculations based on lattice qcd predict a sequential disappearance of the heavy quarkonia and its excited states with the temperature of the strongly interacting systems .",
    "therefore , the heavy quarkonia and its excited states are considered as a thermometer for such system  @xcite . in particular , the measurement of @xmath6 is recognized as a cleaner probe due to its low cross section where the roles of the competing effects that either reduce the yield  @xcite , or enhance it  @xcite , are negligible in contrast to the @xmath11 and its excited states .",
    "furthermore , the contributions from the higher states  feed - down \" of @xmath12 is small compared to the @xmath13 states , where the b meson decays have significant contributions . since the @xmath2 collisions serve as a baseline for the @xmath8 collisions , it is important to understand the quarkonia production mechanisms in @xmath2 , where almost all of the models have difficulties to reproduce the cross sections , transverse momentum p@xmath14 spectra , and polarization simultaneously  @xcite .    in this article , we report the star measurement of the @xmath7 cross section at midrapidity in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath4 = 200 gev . in addition , we address the cold nuclear matter effect by performing similar measurements in d@xmath3 collisions at the same @xmath4 .",
    "the star experiment is adapted for the quarkonium measurements , through the dielectron channels , due to the capabilities of the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite and the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc )  @xcite for electron identification and triggering .",
    "the tpc and bemc have a large acceptance in pseudorapidity @xmath15 1 and full coverage in azimuth @xmath16 .",
    "the tpc is a tracker detector that measures the particles momenta and energy loss per unit length ( de / dx ) and therefore provides particle identification .",
    "the bemc is divided in @xmath17 into 4800 projective towers .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of the star bemc for detecting both electrons from an @xmath7 decay is maximum in the rapidity range @xmath18 0.5 .",
    "the star @xmath7 trigger is composed of two components , level-0 ( l0 ) hardware component and level-2 ( l2 ) software component  @xcite . using a dedicated trigger algorithm exploiting the capabilities of the star bemc , the star experiment sampled an integrated luminosity of 7.9 pb@xmath19 of @xmath2 collisions and 32 nb@xmath19 of d@xmath3 collisions at @xmath4 = 200 gev .",
    "the electrons identified by the tpc are further required to match the trigger conditions at the bemc , and to have the ratio of e / p @xmath20 1 , where e and p are the particle s energy and momentum measured by bemc and tpc respectively .",
    "the @xmath21 pairs are then combined to produce the invariant mass ( @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the pair s momenta , and @xmath25 is the opening angle ) spectrum ( @xmath26 , and the like - sign combinations of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are used to calculate the geometric mean ( 2 @xmath29 ) for the combinatorial background .",
    "the total yield ( @xmath30 = @xmath31 - 2 @xmath29 ) is extracted by integrating the invariant mass spectrum in the @xmath6 region after the background subtraction .",
    "a detailed study of the line shape is performed in order to separate the @xmath6 from the continuum contributions ( drell - yan and @xmath32 ) in the integrated yield region  @xcite . in these analyses",
    "the separation between the individual states of @xmath7 is not possible due the limited statistics and bremsstrahlung tails .",
    "the cross section is obtained from the total yield @xmath30 according to equation 1 .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 is the branching fraction for @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the cross section @xmath37 for the @xmath38 state in the region @xmath39 0.5 , @xmath40 is the rapidity interval for our our kinematic region @xmath39 0.5 , @xmath41 is the total efficiency corrections , and @xmath42 is the integrated luminosity .",
    "the total efficiency corrections is defined as @xmath41= @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the bemc geometrical acceptance , @xmath45 is the vertex - finding efficiency , @xmath46 is the trigger efficiency for l0 , @xmath47 is the trigger efficiency for l2 , @xmath48 is the tpc geometrical acceptance times tracking efficiency , @xmath49 is the tpc - bemc @xmath50 matching efficiency , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the electron identification efficiency .",
    "each term and its uncertainty is estimated through simulations and the total efficiency is included in the reported values of the cross section .",
    "the left panels of fig .  [ fig : invmass1 ] and  [ fig : invmass3 ] show the unlike - sign and like - sign background invariant mass spectrum in @xmath2 collisions and in d@xmath3 collisions respectively . the total yield is found to be @xmath30 = 67 @xmath53 22 ( stat ) in @xmath2 collisions and @xmath30 = 172 @xmath53 20 ( stat ) in d@xmath3 collisions .",
    "the signal significance in d+au ( @xmath54 ) is greater than that in p+p ( @xmath55 ) mainly due to the removal of the silicon detectors in the former collisions which strongly reduced the photon conversions .",
    "figure  [ fig : invmass1 ] ( right panel ) shows the data used to obtain the @xmath7 and continuum yields .",
    "the data points are the unlike - sign @xmath21 signal after subtracting the like - sign combinatorial background .",
    "the fit includes the contributions from the @xmath6 states and the continuum contributions from drell - yan and @xmath12 shown as the solid - line function .",
    "the @xmath6 cross section is found to be @xmath56 = 114 @xmath53 38 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath57 ( syst . ) pb , and the combined continuum contribution is estimated to be @xmath58 = 38 @xmath53 24 pb in the integrated yield region .",
    "figure  [ fig : invmass2 ] ( left panel ) shows the acceptance in rapidity with the hashed histogram where the unlike - sign pairs are shown after the background subtraction .",
    "the scale on the right axis of the figure is used for the counts in the histogram .",
    "the measured cross section of the @xmath6 is compared to the theoretical predictions of nlo cem  @xcite and upper and lower bounds of nlo csm  @xcite .",
    "the nlo cem calculation is for @xmath59 only and therefore the calculation is scaled with the branching ratios and the cross sections of the higher states in order to compare with the measured cross section .",
    "the csm calculation considers the direct @xmath59 production only and therefore the calculation is divided by a factor of 0.42  @xcite to account for the feed - down from the p - states .",
    "while the nlo cem is in agreement with the measured cross section , the upper bound of csm underestimates the data by @xmath20 2@xmath60 effect .",
    "figure  [ fig : invmass2 ] ( right panel ) shows that the measured cross section of @xmath6 is consistent with the world data trend for similar measurements scanning a wide range of @xmath4 in different collision systems .",
    "figure  [ fig : invmass3 ] ( right panel ) shows the measured cross section of the @xmath6 at midrapidity in d@xmath3 which is found to be @xmath56 = 35 @xmath53 4 ( stat . ) @xmath53 5 ( sys . )",
    "nb . the contribution from drell - yan and @xmath61 to the di - electron yield in the @xmath7 mass region is estimated to be @xmath2010@xmath62 based on  @xcite and pythia .",
    "the detailed systematic uncertainty is under study .",
    "the measurement is consistent with nlo cem calculation that includes the anti - shadowing effect , and does nt include absorption effect . in order to study the cold nuclear matter effect , the nuclear modification factor , which is defined as the ratio of the cross section in d@xmath3 collisions to that in @xmath2 collisions scaled with the number of binary collisions ,",
    "is found to be @xmath63 = 0.98 @xmath53 0.32 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath53 0.28 ( sys . ) .",
    "the star experiment has measured the @xmath0 cross section at mid - rapidity in @xmath2 collisions and d@xmath3 collisions at @xmath4 = 200 gev . the measured value in @xmath2 is found to be consistent with the world data trend as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the nlo cem calculations are in agreement with the measurements in @xmath2 and d@xmath3 and the nlo csm underestimated the measured cross section in @xmath2 .",
    "the cold nuclear matter effect is not large , however , more statistics is needed in order to quantify such effects .",
    "the presented measurements will be used as a baseline for studying the hot nuclear matter effect in @xmath8 collisions . with increased luminosity ,",
    "a separation between @xmath7 states will be possible at the star experiment , particularly after reducing the material budget by removing the inner tracker detectors .",
