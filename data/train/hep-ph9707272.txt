    "the study of multiplicity fluctuations as a phenomenological manifestation of quark - hadron phase transition ( pt ) has been pursued in recent years in the framework of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) formalism for both the second - order @xcite-@xcite and first - order @xcite-@xcite pt . in both cases scaling behaviors of the factorial moments",
    "have been found and are characterized by scaling exponents @xmath1 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 for second order pt is independent of the details of the gl parameters .",
    "it therefore provides a distinctive signature for the existence of quark - gluon plasma , if its transition to hadrons is of the second order @xcite .",
    "the experimental verification of @xmath1 has not been carried out so far in heavy - ion collisions , although it has been checked to a high degree of accuracy in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "there are a number of reasons for the difficulties , which will be described below .",
    "the aim of this paper is to devise a method to circumvent the obstacles that stand in the way of extracting the signal from the experimental data . in",
    "so doing we also broaden the scope of the analysis to include aspects of wavelets and correlations , in addition to incorporating some evolutionary properties of heavy - ion collisions that are particularly relevant to hadron production during pt .",
    "let us now examine the difficulties in analyzing multiplicity fluctuations in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the factorial moments that have been suggested to quantify the fluctuations are defined by @xcite @xmath2 where the averages are performed over a distribution , @xmath3 , of the multiplicities @xmath4 in a bin of size @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath4 must be @xmath6 in order for an event to contribute to @xmath7 , for which @xmath8 is usually an integer ranging from 2 to 5 .",
    "as @xmath5 is decreased , the average multiplicity @xmath9 in a bin decreases , and may become @xmath10 in a hadronic collision .",
    "thus @xmath7 measures the tail end of the distribution @xmath3 , where @xmath11 , i.e. large multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "intermittency refers to the power - law dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath5 @xcite @xmath12 a behavior that has been found to be ubiquitous in hadronic and leptonic processes @xcite .",
    "however , in nuclear collisions the situation is very different .    in the first place the average multiplicity in an event in nuclear collisions",
    "is so high that even in bins of small @xmath5 the values of @xmath4 are large compared to the order @xmath8 in ( [ 1 ] ) that has been examined experimentally .",
    "thus unlike hadronic and leptonic processes the existent nuclear data have not been analyzed to study large multiplicity fluctuations , for which @xmath8 must be increased to values @xmath13 in small bins .",
    "the moments @xmath7 for @xmath14 , and @xmath15 that have been determined are dominated by contributions from the lower - order correlations .",
    "this point has been emphasized by sarcevic and collaborators @xcite , where the nuclear data on the cumulants @xmath16 are shown to be consistent with zero for @xmath17 . whether @xmath16 acquire nonvanishing values at smaller @xmath5 ( so that @xmath18 ) is not known .",
    "thus until the experiments can be improved to render the analysis at very small @xmath5 feasible , a new method must be devised to circumvent this difficulty of extracting dynamical information at medium values of @xmath8 .",
    "our strategy is to consider the distribution of the differences in multiplicities between bins and to examine the scaling behavior of its moments .",
    "another difficulty associated with the problem of linking multiplicity fluctuations to the dynamics of phase transition is that the particles are integrated over the entire duration when quarks turn into hadrons , while the system undergoes an expansion . in a second - order pt the fluctuations in hadronization",
    "can be large relative to the average , but that average is over a short period near @xmath19 where hadronization is not robust .",
    "when integrated over the whole history of the nuclear collision process , such fluctuations may well be averaged out , leaving no discernible effect at the detector , which collects all the particles produced in an event .",
    "this problem is present even if there is no thermalization of the hadrons in the final state , which we shall assume in order to focus our investigation here .",
    "our present method is to apply the gl theory in increments of time when hadrons are produced near @xmath19 , and to integrate the production process over the entire duration to yield the measurable multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "our aim is to show that with appropriate care in treating the moments certain scaling behavior persists and characterizes the dynamics of phase transition .",
    "our result reveals a new scaling exponent @xmath0 , different from the one , @xmath1 , found in refs .",
    "it is not a revision of @xmath1 but a new exponent , since different quantities are investigated .",
    "independent of the theoretical considerations underlying this work , the proposed moments can be determined experimentally .",
    "nuclear data should be analyzed in the way suggested , even if pt is not an issue .",
    "if the scaling behavior is found , but the scaling exponent does not agree with the predicted @xmath0 , it would not only imply that there has not been a pt of the gl type , but also present a numerical objective for a successful hadronization model to attain for heavy - ion collisions .",
    "to overcome the problem of high multiplicity per bin in heavy - ion collisions we introduce the factorial moments that we shall refer to as multiplicity difference correlators ( mdc ) .",
    "they are a form of hybrid of factorial correlators @xcite and wavelets @xcite .",
    "mdc are not as elaborate as either one of the two separately , but are simpler combinations of the two , possessing the virtues of both .",
    "let us start with a brief look at the application of wavelet analysis to multiparticle physics @xcite and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "given any event , the structure of a spatial pattern , exemplified here by a one - dimensional function @xmath20 , can be analyzed by a multiresolution decomposition , using the basis functions @xmath21 such that the wavelet coefficients are @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the domain of @xmath20 being analyzed .",
    "this is like a fourier transform , except that instead of the exponential factor @xmath24 , one uses the haar wavelets @xmath25 where @xmath26 the basis function @xmath21 has a scale index @xmath27 and a translation index @xmath28 , which enable the wavelet analysis to identify the location and scale of an arbitrary fluctuation of @xmath20 in terms of @xmath29 .    while ( [ 2.1 ] ) and other transforms like it are very powerful and have various virtues , such as their invertibility , they offer more than what is needed at this point in our search for a measure of the multiplicity fluctuations in heavy - ion collisions that can convey the signature of phase transition . a complete set of @xmath29 records all the information in the spatial pattern in an event , whereas we look for an efficient way of capturing some general features averaged over all events .",
    "the haar wavelets , however , contain some features that we regard as important ingredients for an improvement of the usual factorial moments and correlators @xcite . for a fixed set of the indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we have @xmath30 so @xmath31 it is the difference between the contributions in the neighboring bins , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in some wavelet analyses moments that involve sums over @xmath28",
    "are studied to reveal scaling behaviors in @xmath27 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "that can be done for one event , sometimes referred to as horizontal analysis . for our purpose in what follows ,",
    "we prefer to emphasize first the vertical analysis ; i.  e. , we average over all events for fixed bins . for",
    "multiparticle production @xmath20 would be the particle density and @xmath34 the multiplicities in the bins @xmath35 .",
    "studying the difference @xmath36 of neighboring multiplicities is a way to overcome the problem of high multiplicity per bin without abandoning the focus on multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "once we consider multiplicity differences there is no reason why we should restrict the two bins to only the neighboring ones .",
    "let @xmath37 be the distance between two bins , each of size @xmath5 , and let @xmath38 and @xmath39 be the multiplicities in those bins in a given event .",
    "define @xmath40 to be the multiplicity difference , @xmath41 .",
    "we shall be interested in the distribution @xmath42 after sampling over many events at fixed @xmath37 and @xmath5 .",
    "the factorial moments we shall study are the mdc @xmath43 they are not the same as the biaas - peschanski correlators , which are normalized products of factorial moments of multiplicities in two bins , averaged over all events , @xcite @xmath44 but the two are similar to the extent that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the multiplicities in the two bins separated by @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath45 have been found to depend on @xmath37 , but not on @xmath5 @xcite , but @xmath46 as defined in ( [ 2.6 ] ) will depend on both . @xmath47",
    "differ from @xmath7 defined in ( [ 1 ] ) in that they are the moments of the multiplicity difference distribution ( mdd ) @xmath48 , which is a generalization of the usual multiplicity distribution in a way that incorporates the virtues of both wavelets and correlators .",
    "before we enter into the theoretical description of the mdd @xmath49 in the following sections , we note that the experimental determination of @xmath46 for hadronic and nuclear collisions should be performed independent of theory .",
    "their dependences on @xmath37 and @xmath5 will pose a challenge to any model of such collisions .",
    "our concern in this paper is to make a theoretical prediction of what should be observed when there is a quark - hadron pt .",
    "but if there is no pt , the properties of @xmath46 will remain as valuable features of multiparticle production that a good model of soft interaction must explain .",
    "although our aim is to study the nature of the fluctuations due to quark - hadron pt in heavy - ion collisions , we begin with a formulation that is more generally valid for any hadronic or nuclear collisions . the multiplicities in the two bins discussed in the preceding section fluctuate both statistically and dynamically .",
    "focusing on just the statistical part first , and using , as usual , the poisson distribution @xmath50 for it , we have the statistical mdd @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the average multiplicities in the two bins , and @xmath54 note that , unlike the usual multiplicity , @xmath40 can be both positive and negative .",
    "in fact , the sums in ( [ 3.1 ] ) can be analytically performed , yielding @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the modified bessel function .    in the following",
    "we shall not assign any intrinsic properties to the two bins and consider only the absolute difference between their multiplicities , i.  e. @xmath57 since @xmath56 is symmetric under @xmath58 , we have from ( [ 3.3 ] ) with @xmath59 @xmath60 there is a discontinuity at @xmath61 because for all @xmath62 there is a reflection of @xmath63 in ( [ 3.3 ] ) to @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is properly normalized to @xmath66 .    if @xmath52 and @xmath53 are large , then @xmath67 may be well approximated by gaussian distributions , and @xmath65 would also be gaussian with a width proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "it is because of this reduced width that we consider mdd : as discussed in sec . 1",
    ", we need smaller values of @xmath40 to render lower - order moments effective in measuring the fluctuations .",
    "if @xmath52 and @xmath53 are small , then @xmath65 becomes poissonian also .",
    "for that reason we shall consider factorial moments of @xmath65 , since the statistical fluctuations can thereby be filtered out @xcite . in both experimental analysis and theoretical consideration the bin width @xmath5 is to be varied so that @xmath69 will range over both large and small values ; hence , no approximation of @xmath65 will be made .",
    "we now introduce the dynamical component of the fluctuations .",
    "denoting it by @xmath70 we have for the observable mdd @xmath71 in essence this is a double poisson transform of the dynamical @xmath72 , which is a generalization of the formalism for photon counting in quantum optics , later adapted by bp for particle production @xcite .",
    "it is this distribution @xmath49 that we have proposed to study by use of the mdc @xmath46 , defined in ( [ 2.6 ] ) .",
    "our aim is to examine the scaling properties of @xmath46 and extract universal features that are characteristic of the dynamics of the problem .",
    "there are many directions in which one can pursue from here . for",
    "the dynamical distribution @xmath72 one can consider the mathematical @xmath73 model @xcite , or the more physical models such as the fritiof model @xcite , venus @xcite and ecco @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may want to emphasize the large - scale space - time structure by considering the small @xmath37 behavior in an interferometry type of analysis @xcite .",
    "for us in this paper we want to consider the opposite , namely : the large @xmath37 behavior where the global size of the particle emitting volume is unimportant .",
    "the usual short - range correlation in rapidity in low-@xmath74 multiparticle production @xcite would also be not important , if @xmath37 is sufficiently large , but not large enough to cause kinematical constraint .",
    "our purpose is to go to a region where fluctuations due to the dynamics of pt are the only ones that need to be taken into account .",
    "more specifically , we shall identify @xmath75 with the boltzmann factor , @xmath76 , in the ginzburg - landau theory , in which @xmath52 and @xmath53 will be functions of the order parameter .",
    "in fact , for two identical bins at large @xmath37 apart in two regions of the expanding system that have similar spatial and temporal properties , we may set @xmath77 , ignore @xmath37 and rewrite ( [ 3.6 ] ) as @xmath78 there remains a complication arising from the property that pt occurs over an extended period of time and that the detected hadrons are the result of an integration over that period .",
    "that is the subject we turn to in the next section .",
    "the conventional view of the physical system in a heavy - ion collision at very high energy is that a cylinder of locally thermalized partons expands as a fluid , mainly in the longitudinal direction , but also in the radial direction at a slower rate .",
    "if the colliding nuclei are massive enough , and the incident energy high enough , the temperature in the interior of the cylinder may be higher than the critical temperature @xmath19 for quark - hadron pt , which we shall assume to be second order . due to the transverse expansion the temperature @xmath79 decreases with increasing radius , at least initially and for the most part of the lifetime of the system .",
    "thus hadronization takes place mainly on the surface of the cylinder where @xmath80 .",
    "being a second - order pt there is no mixed phase where quarks and hadrons coexist .",
    "we assume that there is no thermalized hadronic phase surrounding the partonic cylinder , so the hadrons formed on the surface move in free flow to the detector . with these simplifying assumptions , which are not unrealistic at extremely high collision energies , we can then focus on the issue of relating the hadronization process on the surface to the hadron multiplicity collected by the detector .",
    "consider first just one bin , which occupies @xmath81 in pseudorapidity @xmath82 and azimuthal angle @xmath83 .",
    "we define @xmath84 to be its area .",
    "such an area selected by an analyst of the data corresponds to a similar area on the surface of the cylinder .",
    "let the hadronization time be @xmath85 , which is of order 1 fm / c : it is the average time for the formation of one hadron on the surface . during that time we use the gl description of pt to specify the probability @xmath86 that @xmath87 hadrons are created in the area @xmath84 .",
    "the gl free energy , being time independent , does not track the time evolution of the system .",
    "it is also not equipped to describe the spatial variations on the surface , nor need it be . as a mean field theory ,",
    "it is concerned with the probability for pt near @xmath19 as a function of the order parameter @xmath88 .",
    "let the two - dimensional coordinates on the surface be labeled by @xmath89 , then the gl free energy is @xcite @xmath90 = \\int_{\\delta ^2}dz \\left[a \\left|\\phi(z)\\right|^2 + b\\left|\\phi(z)\\right|^4   + c\\left|\\partial\\phi/\\partial z \\right|^2 \\right ] \\quad , \\label{4.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are gl parameters that depend on @xmath79 .",
    "for hadronization within the bin of size @xmath84 it is only necessary to integrate @xmath89 over that area . for @xmath94",
    "the gl theory requires that @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "we have found in @xcite that for small bins the third term in ( [ 4.1 ] ) does not have any significant effect on the multiplicity fluctuations , so we shall set @xmath97 , as it has been done in all previous work @xcite-@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we make the approximation that @xmath98 is constant in @xmath84 so that @xmath90 = \\delta ^2 \\left(a \\left|\\phi\\right|^2 + b\\left|\\phi\\right|^4    \\right ) \\quad , \\label{4.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that this is valid for any local area on the cylindrical surface , the same free energy is to be used for both bins of @xmath65 in ( [ 3.6 ] ) , resulting in the same average multiplicity @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we now must specify the relationship between @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    as discussed extensively in @xcite ,",
    "the square of the order parameter @xmath100 is the hadron density @xmath101 , which , in the absence of fluctuations around the minimum of ( [ 4.2 ] ) at @xmath102 , is zero for @xmath103 but positive for @xmath104 .",
    "thus the average multiplicity in a bin is @xmath105 it should be borne in mind , however , that this is the average multiplicity during the hadronization time @xmath85 , when the system is momentarily regarded as static , and the gl consideration is applied to describe the formation of hadrons from quarks at @xmath106 .",
    "it is not the average multiplicity in @xmath107 registered by the detector , since the experimental measurement integrates the hadronization process over the entire lifetime @xmath108 of the whole parton system , during which partons are continuously converted to hadrons .",
    "thus the measured average multiplicity in @xmath84 is @xmath109 where @xmath110 is formally the time - dependent order parameter , which has to be varied in a functional - integral description of @xmath111 .",
    "indeed , @xmath87 in ( [ 4.5 ] ) is the average multiplicity of @xmath112 in ( [ 3.7 ] ) , but @xmath113 in ( [ 4.4 ] ) is the relevant average multiplicity for the gl description during @xmath85 .",
    "thus to adapt the formalism of the previous sections to the pt process in heavy - ion collisions , it is necessary to modify ( [ 3.7 ] ) into a functional integral @xmath114 \\quad , \\label{4.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 , @xmath116 $ ] and the integral in ( [ 4.5 ] ) has been discretized into @xmath117 segments . in each segment",
    "@xmath88 is spatially and temporally constant in @xmath84 and is itself integrated over the whole complex plane . for collisions of large nuclei @xmath118",
    "may be a large number . herein lies the crux of the problem :",
    "pt at @xmath94 gives sparingly few hadrons within @xmath119 in any time interval around @xmath85 , but the detected number in a bin at the end of the collision process is roughly @xmath118 times as many .",
    "our aim to find some universal feature of the problem that is essentially independent of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath5 and @xmath118 .",
    "we now proceed to determine the multiplicity difference correlator mdc , which in the present case of large @xmath37 has no dependence on @xmath37 and is just the normalized factorial moments @xmath46 of the mdd @xmath49 defined in ( [ 2.6 ] ) . as we have mentioned in general terms earlier ,",
    "an important reason for studying @xmath49 instead of the usual multiplicity distribution @xmath3 in a single bin is the largeness of @xmath120 in ( [ 4.6 ] ) , when @xmath118 is large . in that case",
    "the bin multiplicity @xmath4 is high , so factorial moments of low orders are ineffective in extracting genuine correlations .",
    "multiplicity difference @xmath40 is on the average proportional to @xmath121 , thus enabling @xmath47 to be more effective at low @xmath8 .    setting @xmath122 in ( [ 3.5 ] ) , with @xmath123 we have the distribution @xmath65 in ( [ 4.6 ] ) @xmath124 where @xmath59 .",
    "let us simplify ( [ 4.6 ] ) by using the variable @xmath125 , getting @xmath126 where @xmath127 for notational economy @xmath118 has been redefined as @xmath128 it is therefore the @xmath118 defined earlier in units of @xmath129 .",
    "it makes physical sense because @xmath129 is a measure of how readily hadronization can take place in the gl theory .",
    "the minimum of @xmath130 $ ] in ( [ 4.2 ] ) is at @xmath131 , for @xmath95 , so there would be virtually no hadron condensates apart from fluctuations , if @xmath132 , resulting in @xmath133 . thus the expanding parton system must drive the surface temperature to below @xmath19 , making @xmath91 sufficiently negative and @xmath134 large enough to produce hadrons at a rate just such as to carry away the necessary energy to maintain the hydrodynamical flow with @xmath104 at the surface .",
    "the beauty of the gl approach is that all the complications of the hydrodynamics of the problem are hidden in a few parameters , which would be in the final answer [ like @xmath118 and @xmath135 in ( [ 5.3 ] ) ] unless we can find observables that are insensitive to them .    to find such observables we now calculate the normalized factorial moments @xmath46 of @xmath49 using ( [ 2.6 ] ) .",
    "we first fix @xmath118 and examine @xmath46 as a function of @xmath135 , which is proportional to @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "1 we show how @xmath136 depends on @xmath137 for @xmath138 and @xmath139 . no simple behavior can be ascribed to the rising and falling of the curves .",
    "it should be noticed that the increase of @xmath46 with increasing @xmath5 is opposite to the usual behavior of the single - bin factorial moments @xmath7 @xcite , which increase with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "thus @xmath46 do not have the intermittency behavior of bp @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the dependences of @xmath46 on @xmath135 for the various @xmath8 values shown in fig .",
    "1 suggest that we should examine , as in @xcite , the dependences of @xmath46 on @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "that is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the dots are the values of @xmath46 for @xmath142 with @xmath143 being integers in the range @xmath144 . the straightlines are fits of the linear portions . clearly , @xmath46 exhibit the power - law behavior @xmath145 which we shall call @xmath146-scaling .",
    "it is a scaling behavior that is independent of @xmath5 and @xmath92 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath91 is so far unknown , since the calculation is done at a fixed @xmath118 .    from the slopes of the straight lines in fig .",
    "2 we show in fig .",
    "3 the dependence of @xmath147 on @xmath8 . it can be well fitted by the formula @xmath148 where @xmath149 .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath0 here for the scaling exponent , instead of @xmath1 , which we have used previously for a similarly defined quantity [ as in ( [ 5.7 ] ) ] for @xmath7 . for comparison",
    ", we recall that @xcite @xmath150 thus the scaling exponent @xmath0 for mdc is significantly lower . lower value of that exponent means larger fluctuations .",
    "so far the result is for @xmath138 only . to see the dependences on @xmath118",
    ", we have repeated the calculation for a range of @xmath118 values .",
    "scaling behavior as in ( [ 5.6 ] ) has been found in each case , and ( [ 5.7 ] ) is also well satisfied .",
    "4 shows the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath118 .",
    "evidently , it is nearly constant for @xmath151 with the value @xmath152 thus , the result of this study is embodied in just one number , @xmath0 .",
    "it is independent of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath5 , and @xmath118 , provided that @xmath91 is negative to allow hadronization .",
    "the universality of @xmath0 is remarkable and should be checked experimentally . if a signature of quark - hadron pt depends on the details of the heavy - ion collisions , such as nuclear sizes , collision energy , transverse energy , etc .",
    ", even after they have passed the thresholds for the creation of quark - gluon plasma , such a signature is likely to be sensitive to the theoretical model used . here",
    "@xmath0 is independent of such details ; it depends only on the validity of the gl description of pt for the present problem .",
    "the mdd @xmath49 can readily be measured experimentally , and the moments @xmath46 directly determined as functions of bin size .",
    "if the scaling behavior ( [ 5.6 ] ) , supplemented by ( [ 5.7 ] ) , is satisfied with @xmath153 , then we may interpret the system as having undergone a second - order pt describable by the gl theory .    in the absence of pt",
    "we may regard the two bins separated by a large @xmath37 to be totally uncorrelated . in that case @xmath154 can be identified with @xmath155 $ ] , where , if we vary @xmath87 in the range @xmath156 , the corresponding @xmath46 without pt can be calculated directly . again , @xmath146-scaling is found , satisfying ( [ 5.6 ] ) and ( [ 5.7 ] ) , but this time with @xmath157 this value is sufficiently separated from that of ( [ 5.9 ] ) derived for pt so that phenomenological distinquishability between the two cases should be quite feasible .",
    "in this work we have solved a number of problems that have obstructed the study of multiplicity fluctuations in heavy - ion collisions as a means of finding signatures of quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "one problem is the large multiplicities even in small bins , for which the usual factorial moments @xmath7 fail to reveal distinctive features for @xmath158 , since events with large fluctuations are submerged by generic events .",
    "that is mainly an experimental problem where the analysis of the data can not be pushed to the regions @xmath159 .",
    "another problem of more theoretical nature is that the application of the ginzburg - landau theory of pt needs special tailoring for a system whose lifetime is finite , but long compared to the transition time for individual hadrons , and whose observables are integrated over that time .",
    "we have overcome both of these problems by showing the effectiveness of studying the fluctuations of multiplicity differences .",
    "we have started with wavelet analysis and found that it generates more information than can easily be filtered to yield a succinct signature of pt .",
    "however , we extracted a simple feature of the wavelets and considered the mdd , @xmath49 , involving two bins separated by a distance @xmath37 .",
    "although @xmath37 can be any value , we have considered only large @xmath37 in order to apply the simplest description of pt by the gl theory .",
    "the time integration problem of the detectable multiplicities is handled at the expense of an extra parameter @xmath118 , which can not be specified without a hydrodynamical model lying outside the scope of this treatment .",
    "the goal has then been to find a measure of pt that is independent of the unknown parameters in the problem .    that goals was achieved by the discovery that the factorial moments @xmath46 of @xmath49 satisfy a scaling behavior that is characterized by a number @xmath153 .",
    "it is independent of the details of the dynamics , except that a pt occurs in a way describable by the the gl theory .",
    "thus @xmath0 is a universal constant for the problem .",
    "we call @xmath0 a scaling exponent , but it has absolutely no connection with the critical exponents of the conventional critical phenomena .",
    "there is no need to know the temperature , which is not measurable , or the critical @xmath19 .",
    "the moments @xmath46 can directly be determined from the data , and can therefore be checked for @xmath146-scaling , independent of any theoretical input .",
    "whatever experimental value the exponent @xmath0 turns out to be would be of great interest , since a value different from 1.1 would demand an explanation . if it approaches 1.1 as energy or nuclear size is increased , it would suggest an approach to the condition required for the formation of quark - gluon plasma .",
    "experimentally , it should be easy to vary @xmath37 and check not only how @xmath46 themselves depend on @xmath37 , but also whether and how the scaling behavior is affected",
    ". the @xmath37 dependence has not been investigated here . theoretically , there are many other challenges that also await undertaking",
    ". a verification of @xmath160 will undoubtedly stimulate an upsurge of interest in the study of multiplicity fluctuations in particle and nuclear collisions .",
