    "the bakry - emery method allows one to establish convex sobolev inequalities and to compute exponential decay rates towards equilibrium for solutions to diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "the key idea of bakry and emery is to differentiate a so - called entropy functional twice with respect to time and to relate the second - order derivative to the entropy production .",

    "@xcite computed exponential decay rates for time - continuous markov processes , using the bochner - bakry - emery method . given a stochastic process with density @xmath0 and the entropy functional @xmath1 , the core of the bakry - emery approach is to find a constant @xmath2 such that the inequality @xmath3 holds for all time . integrating this inequality ,",
    "one may show that @xmath4 which implies that @xmath5 for all @xmath6 , i.e. , the entropy decays exponentially fast along @xmath0 .",
    "the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is achieved in @xcite by employing a discrete bochner - type identity which replaces the bochner identity of the continuous case .",
    "the bochner - bakry - emery method was extended by fathi and maas in @xcite in the context of ricci curvature bounds and used by the authors of @xcite to derive discrete beckner inequalities .",
    "another approach has been suggested by mielke @xcite .",
    "he investigated geodesic convexity properties of nonlocal transportation distances on probability spaces such that continuous - time markov chains can be formulated as gradient flows .",
    "very related results have been obtained independently by chow et al .",
    "@xcite and maas @xcite .",
    "the geodesic convexity property implies exponential decay rates @xcite .",
    "mielke showed that the inequality @xmath3 is equivalent to the positive semi - definiteness of a certain matrix such that matrix algebra can be applied .",
    "this idea was extended recently to certain nonlinear fokker - planck equations @xcite .",
    "all these examples involve spatial semi - discretizations of diffusion equations .",
    "temporal semi - discretizations often employ the implicit euler scheme since it gives entropy dissipation , @xmath9 , under rather general conditions ; see , e.g. , the implicit euler finite - volume approximations in @xcite .",
    "entropy - dissipating higher - order semi - discretizations have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "however , there seem to be no results for fully discrete schemes using the bakry - emery approach . in this paper",
    ", we make a first step to fill this gap .    in order to understand the mathematical difficulty in fully discrete schemes ,",
    "consider the abstract cauchy problem @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a ( nonlinear ) operator defined on its domain @xmath12 of the banach space @xmath13 with dual @xmath14 .",
    "if the dual product @xmath15 is nonnegative , where @xmath16 is the ( frchet ) derivative of the entropy and @xmath0 a solution to , then @xmath17 showing entropy dissipation .",
    "next , consider the implicit euler scheme @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an approximation of @xmath20 and @xmath21 is an approximation of @xmath22 still satisfying @xmath23 .",
    "here , @xmath24 is the discrete entropy , which is supposed to be convex .",
    "then entropy dissipation is preserved by the scheme since @xmath25 the problem is to estimate the discrete analog of @xmath7 .",
    "it turns out that the inequality in is too weak , we need an equation ; see section [ sec.cbe ] for details .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by developing two ideas .",
    "the _ first idea _ is to identify the elements which are necessary to build an abstract discrete bakry - emery method . unlike in the continuous case , we distinguish between the discrete entropy production @xmath26 and the fisher information @xmath27 .",
    "we explain this difference in section [ sec.abstract ] .",
    "the bakry - emery method relies on an estimate of @xmath28 , which approximates @xmath7 .",
    "for this estimate , discrete versions of suitable integrations by parts and chain rules are necessary .",
    "our _ second idea _ is to `` translate '' a nonlinear integration - by - parts formula to the discrete case , using the systematic integration by parts method of @xcite .",
    "this leads to a new inequality for numerical three - point schemes as explained next .",
    "again , consider first the continuous case .",
    "we show in lemma [ lem.ineq ] that for all @xmath29 and all smooth positive functions @xmath30 , @xmath31 where the constant @xmath32 depends on @xmath22 and @xmath33 ; see below . the proof is based on systematic integration by parts @xcite .",
    "the discrete counterpart is the following inequality : for any @xmath34 , there exists a region @xmath35 of admissible values @xmath36 , containing the line @xmath37 , such that for all @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 ; see lemma [ lem.ineqd ] .",
    "interestingly , the inequality is not true for each term but only with the sum .",
    "the admissible set @xmath35 for is generally smaller than @xmath43 ; see section [ sec.ibp ] .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "inequality is the first nonlinear summation - by - parts formula derived from a systematic method .",
    "we believe that this idea will lead to a whole family of new finite - difference inequalities useful in numerical analysis , and we will explore this in a future work .",
    "we apply the abstract discrete bakry - emery method in section [ sec.pme ] to an implicit euler finite - difference approximation of the porous - medium equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the one - dimensional torus .",

    "to overcome the difficulty with the entropy production inequality , we introduce the new variable @xmath58 and write the porous - medium equation in the form @xmath59 the advantage of this formulation is that the entropy becomes _ linear _ in the variable @xmath60 . thus avoiding inequality .",
    "we discretize by an implicit euler finite - difference scheme .",

    "we show in lemma [ lem.ex ] the existence of solutions to as well as the preservation of nonnegativity .",

    "unfortunately , the theorem does not apply to the shannon entropy @xmath88 , corresponding to @xmath89 , since @xmath90 as @xmath89 .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath89 , the entropy production @xmath91 can not be bounded from above by the fisher information @xmath92 and so , assumption a1 of our abstract bakry - emery method does not hold ; see section [ sec.dbe ] .",
    "erbar and maas @xcite showed that the gradient flow of the shannon entropy with respect to a nonlocal transportation measure equals the discrete porous - medium equation in one space dimension .",
