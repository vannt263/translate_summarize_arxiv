    "in particular it has been suggested it should depend on the magnetic field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( shu et al . 2004 ) ) or on a critical density where the gas changes from a phase where it cools through molecular lines to a phase where it is heated due to coupling to the dust ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( larson 2005 ) ) .",
    "* shu et al . ( 2004 ) ) suggested that the stellar mass is decided by the supercritical fraction of the molecular core which is inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength . to date , very little has been done in searching for variations in the imf as a function of mass to magnetic flux density ratio in star forming regions .",
    "the magnetic field component along the line of sight has been measured in some star forming molecular clouds ( * ? ? ? * ( crutcher 1999 ) ) , and variations in the mass to magnetic flux density ratio of a factor of 6 has been found .",
    "in contrast , ( * ? ? ? * larson ( 2005 ) ) has suggested a characteristic mass is associated with the critical density where the gas undergoes a change in the polytropic index from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "simulations have shown that an increase in the polytropic index tends to increase the average fragmentation mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( li et al . 2003 ) ) . the increase in the typical mass of a fragment results in a natural characteristic mass corresponding to the jeans mass at the critical density .",
    "since it is the interplay between cooling and heating that determines the critical density , it should be expected to vary with metallicity . due to the lower amount of dust at low metallicities ,",
    "the coupling of gas and dust occurs at a higher density and the jeans mass at this point might actually be lower than for solar metallicity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( larson 2005 ) ) .",
    "clusters with different metallicities can be found within the galaxy by probing both inner and outer galaxy young clusters .",
    "possibly the imf is already imprinted in the molecular clump mass spectrum before any star formation has taken place . combining the clump mass spectrum recently derived for iras19410 + 2336 for the mass range 320 m@xmath1 ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ( motte et al . 1998 ) ) , the shape is similar to the stellar imf .",
    "this could indicate that the stellar imf might not be determined by e.g. outflows and stellar winds . probing clusters of different masses",
    "might indicate if this is true or not .",
    "massive clusters have more massive stars and can therefore have a stronger effect on their environment through their uv flux and strong winds .",
    "variations of the characteristic mass will have a strong effect on the relative numbers of high- to low - mass stars .",
    "changing the mass where the imf flattens from a salpeter power law to + 1 dex shallower from 0.5 m@xmath1 to 0.3 m@xmath1 will lower the ratio of 1.010 m@xmath1 stars to 0.11.0 m@xmath1 by 30% .",
    "a change to 0.7 m@xmath1 will increase this ratio by 40% .",
    "we have begun a study of possible variations in the imf by choosing clusters at different masses , metallicities and mass to magnetic flux density ratios . here , we present preliminary results for three of them : mon r2 , w51 , and r136 .",
