    "the high frequency peaked bl lac ( hbl ) object pks 2155 - 304 was the target of a new multi - wavelength campaign from april to october 2013 involving these three instruments .",
    "this campaign provides a more complete coverage of the x - ray and @xmath0-ray range than the previous campaign held in 2008 , which involved _ _ fermi _ _ , h.e.s.s . and also atom , _ swift _ and _ rxte _ and lasted for 11 days @xcite .",

    "the h.e.s.s . experiment consists of an array of 5 telescopes : four @xmath2 diameter dish telescopes in operation since 2004 and and a fifth , ct5 , a @xmath3 diameter dish , in operation since 2012 .",
    "this yields an energy threshold of the instrument to be of the order of a few tens of gev .",

    "the spectrum is well described by a simple power - law with an energy threshold of 98  gev : @xmath5 with @xmath6 the decorrelation energy .",

    "fermi__-lat  @xcite data have been analysed using the sciencetools v9r34p1 and the new pass 8 irfs yielding an extended energy range with respect to previous analysis and an increased effective area , better psf and background rejection with respect to the pass 7 irfs .",

    "for all observations , the source was detected at high significance from the lower end of nustar bandpass ( @xmath13  kev ) up to ( typically ) 40  kev .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard nustar pipeline ( nustardas ) with the source extracted from a region @xmath13 in radius around the centroid of the source , and the background subtracted from a similarly sized source - free region .",
    "each pointing was analyzed independently .",
    "we found that in all cases , the source was adequately fitted with a power law model .",
    "flux variability have been found from one observation to another and the nustar spectrum seems to be steeper when the source is fainter ( ranging roughly from @xmath14 2.5 to 3 ) - a trend also seen in other hbl objects studied by nustar .",
    "we also searched for the onset of the inverse compton component , expected to appear at some point in the hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "here , we searched for statistically significant improvement of the quality of fit with the addition of a hard ( assumed @xmath15 ) spectral component .",
    "there is no clear indication for a presence of such component ( primarily because the cosmic x - ray background and instrumental background become more significant at higher energies ) , and we can limit the flux of this component in the 2040 kev band to be less than @xmath16 erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 ( fig .
