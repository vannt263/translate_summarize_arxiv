    "we consider for the simplicity , the linear transport problem , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a scalar field transported by flow of constant velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the exact solution of linear transport equation [ eqsec1 ] is given by @xmath3 seemingly simple , the linear transport equation ( [ eq1sec1 ] ) has played a crucial role in the development of the numerical methods for general hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "it is the closed form solution ( [ eq2sec1 ] ) of ( [ eq1sec1 ] ) which pave the way to analyze any new numerical scheme devised for more complex non - linear hyperbolic problems for its convergence and stability .",
    "considering the solution ( [ eq2sec1 ] ) , it is natural to seek a numerical scheme which is stable in the sense that it does not induce numerical oscillations .",
    "therefore , the notion of stability of a numerical schemes evolves around the induced spurious numerical oscillations . in order to elaborate it",
    ", we consider a uniform grid with the spatial width @xmath4 , time step @xmath5 and denote the discrete mesh point @xmath6 by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    in the seminal work courant - friedrichs and levy shown that for the convergence a difference scheme must contains the physical domain of dependence of partial differential equation @xcite . in other words",
    ", they gave a necessary condition on ratio of the spatial and time discretization step for the convergence of the difference scheme known as cfl number .",
    "since then , the notion of cfl condition has been an indispensable tool for defining the stability of numerical schemes .",
    "it is known that the linear von - neumann stability analysis of a numerical scheme for ( [ eq1sec1 ] ) deduces a stability condition on the cfl number @xmath9 . moreover , almost all notion of non - linear stability such as upwind range condition , monotone stability @xcite , positivity preserving @xcite , total variation stability @xcite heavily relies on cfl number to devise any new stable scheme e.g. , tvd schemes in @xcite , essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) schemes @xcite , weighted essentially non - oscillatory schemes @xcite .",
    "apart from the notion of stability , in a recent paper cfl number is exploited for improved approximation by the flux limiters based scheme in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in the stability of the following ftcs scheme .",
    "it is obtained by the discretization of ( [ eq1sec1 ] ) by replacing the time derivative with a forward difference , and the space derivative with a centred difference formula i.e. , @xmath10 above three point centred ftcs scheme ( [ ftcs1 ] ) seems to be a correct and natural choice as the spatial discretization in ftcs does not violets the physical domain of dependence of ( [ eq1sec1 ] ) given in @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the ftcs ( [ ftcs1 ] ) and the centered lax - wendroff(lxw ) scheme @xcite shares the same spatial stencil of grid points . note that for the cfl number @xmath11 the three point centred lxw scheme is linearly stable @xcite .",
    "contrary to the expectation , the solution obtained by ftcs scheme ( [ ftcs1 ] ) is diverging and and induced oscillations grow exponentially no matter how small the time step is compared to the space step .",
    "the classical von - neumann stability analysis also shows that ftcs ( [ ftcs1 ] ) is unconditionally unstable .",
    "moreover , ftcs does not satisfies any of the notion of non - linear stability mentioned above see @xcite .",
    "the above , unconditional unstability ftcs scheme ( [ ftcs1 ] ) is surprising as it can be observed that for smooth initial data , such as sinusoidal wave , the induced oscillations by ftcs does not grow immediately .",
    "moreover , the magnitude and occurrence of induced oscillations can be controlled by choosing small cfl number @xmath12 , see figure [ fig1 ] . on the other hand when applied on discontinuous data , ftcs introduces strong oscillations immediately see figure [ fig2](a ) .",
    "these observations have been the motivation for the present study on the dependence of induced oscillations by ftcs scheme on data type and cfl number . in the following result , a classification on data type is given in terms of ratio of consecutive gradients which is defined as @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the time and space step ratio satisfies the cfl condition @xmath15 and denote the sign of @xmath16 by @xmath17 .",

    "rewrite ftcs ( [ ftcs1 ] ) in the form @xmath20    * * let @xmath21 : * ftcs ( [ ftcs2 ] ) can be written as , @xmath22 which can be rewritten in upwind stencil form as , @xmath23 where the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 . note that @xmath26 , thus to ensure non - oscillatory stable approximation such that @xmath27 by ( [ ftcs4 ] ) , it is sufficient that @xmath28 inequalities ( [ inq1 ] ) satisfies if , @xmath29 which on inversion yield non - oscillatory condition for ftcs scheme ( [ ftcs1 ] ) in case of @xmath30 , @xmath31 * * let @xmath32 * , then ( [ ftcs2 ] ) can be written in upwind stencil form as , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
