    "one of the most exciting recent developments in astronomy was the discovery of crystalline silicate stardust by the infrared space observatory ( iso ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "it has been suggested that agb stars could contain @xmath510% crystalline silicates @xcite , so it is vital to understand the formation of dust around agb stars to resolve this apparent discrepancy .",
    "agb stars are luminous cool giants , with high mass - loss rates ( @xmath6m@xmath7/yr ) , which increase over time @xcite .",
    "they are highly evolved descendants of low- to intermediate - mass ( 0.88m@xmath7 ) stars .",
    "mass loss produces a circumstellar envelope , where dust forms .",
    "the order in which different species condense from the outflowing gas depends on the physical conditions within the envelope .",
    "once @xmath8 is very high the circumstellar shell becomes optically thick , even at ir wavelengths , and the silicate emission features absorb themselves .",
    "the dust mineralogy is dictated by the dust condensation sequence and depends strongly on @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the mineralogy depends only on the age of the star for a given initial stellar mass .    to date , crystalline silicate features have been seen clearly only in emission .",
    "it has been proposed that crystalline silicate absorption at 11@xmath9 m contributes to the broadening of the classic 10@xmath9 m amorphous silicate absorption feature associated with oh / ir stars @xcite .",
    "however , iras17495@xmath02534 ( hereafter i17495 ) is the first object to show a distinct crystalline 11@xmath9 m absorption feature .",

    "@xcite found that , for non - embedded free - flying particles of forsterite , the feature actually peaks at 11.06@xmath9 m .",
    "composition , grain - shape and grain - size can significantly shift the position of this feature .",
    "crystalline silicates were first observed around evolved stars with very high @xmath8 , leading to the inference that crystal formation requires such conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    ", we can use the outflow velocity to calculate the timescale for dust to cool from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . for @xmath21m@xmath7/yr ,",
    "the timescale is @xmath4612 months , providing ample time for annealing and crystallization .",
    "this suggests that crystalline silicates should be more common in high @xmath8 stars and the observed @xmath8crystallinity correlation is not merely due to masking of the crystalline spectral features ( c.f .",
    "in addition , for stars with @xmath8@xmath5@xmath22m@xmath7/yr forsterite forms at a higher temperature than enstatite ( crystalline mgsio@xmath3 ) , and the difference in @xmath17 for these two species increases with @xmath8 ( see   [ dustformmech ] ) .",
    "we used the 1-d radiative transfer ( rt ) program dusty @xcite , to determine the gross mineralogy associated with the mid - ir absorption features .",
    "rt modeling is inherently degenerate @xcite and hence models are not unique .",
    "consequently , we use the modeling only to constrain @xmath23 and to determine which minerals are inconsistent with the observed spectral features .",

    "@xmath241200k for mg@xmath1sio@xmath2 and mgsio@xmath3 .",
    "models with t@xmath25 800k could not match the observations because the near - ir becomes too bright , and in the mid - ir the spectrum slopes the wrong way .",
    "one important result of the modeling is that pyroxenes can be excluded from the mineralogy in i17495 .",
    "the underlying amorphous silicate feature is unusually narrow and peaks closer to 10@xmath9 m rather than 9.7@xmath9 m , consistent with mg@xmath1sio@xmath2 glass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "models incorporating amorphous silicate of pyroxene composition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or other more silica - rich compositions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are inconsistent with the observed spectrum , as the peak position of the feature gets too blue , and the fwhm gets too wide . increasing the iron content in olivine has a similar effect on the peak position @xcite .",
    "our models suggest that the crystalline component is also dominated by forsterite with enstatite and other crystalline compositions limited to less than a few percent of the dust mass . therefore ,",
    "both amorphous and crystalline dust is dominated by mg@xmath1sio@xmath26 .",
    "this observed forsteritic mineralogy needs to be understood in terms of dust formation mechanisms .",
    "there are effectively three competing dust formation mechanisms for circumstellar environments : ( i ) thermodynamic equilibrium condensation @xcite ; ( ii ) formation of chaotic solids in a supersaturated gas followed by annealing @xcite ; ( iii ) formation of seed nuclei in a supersaturated gas , followed by mantle growth @xcite .",
    "the latter should follow thermodynamic equilibrium as long as density is high enough for gas - grain reactions to occur .",
    "several observational studies support the thermodynamic condensation sequence @xcite , which is consistent with both ( i ) and ( iii ) . in mechanism ( ii ) , chaotic grains form with the bulk composition of the gas , and then anneal if the temperature is high enough @xcite .",
    "this mechanism predicts that at low c / o ratios , the dust grains would comprise a mixture of olivine , pyroxene and silica , rather than be dominated by olivine alone . at high c / o ratios ,",
    "al - o bonds are predicted to form preferentially , leading to dust dominated by oxides rather than silicates .",
    "these predictions are inconsistent with observations @xcite .    in the seed - mantle model , mg@xmath1sio@xmath2 is expected to use more refractory condensates as nucleation centers ( e.g.  al@xmath1o@xmath3 ; see fig .  [ ptspace ] ) .",
    "whether the transformation into mgsio@xmath3 by gas - grain reaction occurs is then dependent on gas density .",
    "condensation and annealing experiments show that the resulting dust is dominated by forsterite ; enstatite is present only in trace amounts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in laboratory experiments ,",
    "the density is always high compared to circumstellar shells , so they may only be relevant to the highest @xmath8 .",
    "the modeled mineralogy is consistent with an abrupt decrease in density between the formation temperatures for forsterite and enstatite .",
    "once @xmath420% of the si atoms are incorporated into dust , the opacity is such that radiation pressure accelerates the circumstellar material , resulting in a precipitous density decrease , and inhibiting further gas - grain reactions @xcite . at high",
    "@xmath8 , forsterite is stable at a higher temperature than enstatite .",
    "formation of forsterite grains provides the impetus for radiation - driven acceleration and thus reduces the efficacy of enstatite formation , leaving gas that is depleted in mg and thus more silica - rich . without a surface on which to nucleate",
    ", silicates will tend to form amorphous solids rather than crystals @xcite , thus the seed nuclei are of the utmost importance to forming crystalline grains . moreover",
    ", the dispersion due to radiation pressure may lead to seedless amorphous dust formation in the low density gas , which should be slightly more silica - rich than mgsio@xmath3 due to the depletion of mg into forsterite grains .",
    "the glass composition should tend towards mg@xmath1si@xmath3o@xmath27 , which is one of the metastable compositions predicted by @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the appearance of the clear crystalline absorption feature in i17495 is related not to increased crystallinity , but rather to less masking of the feature as a result of similar crystalline and amorphous silicate compositions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this still leaves the question of why this source is different  how can this source have both its crystalline and amorphous dust components dominated by mg@xmath1sio@xmath2 , given that the bulk composition of the gas is closer to mgsio@xmath3 ?",
    "the physical factors which could give rise to the extremely high crystal content include : ( 1 ) @xmath8 ; ( 2 ) @xmath13 ; ( 3 ) metallicity ; ( 4 ) c / o ratio .",
    "@xmath8 for i17495 is high , but similar to oh / ir stars and other color mimics , suggesting that @xmath8 alone can not explain the high degree of crystallinity exhibited by this source .",
    "a low @xmath13 would increase the pressure at a given temperature and thus promote grain formation / growth at higher temperatures .",
    "however , @xmath13 for i17495 is relatively high .",
    "increasing metallicity increases the partial pressure of the dust forming elements , and thus increases the dust formation temperature at a given total gas pressure .",
    "the metallicity of the source is unknown , although its location in the galactic plane suggests that it may have higher than solar metallicity .",
    "if metallicity were the determining cause , we would expect to see similar spectra in the gb oh / ir stars .",
    "the fact that even the high @xmath8 gb stars do not exhibit such a distinct crystalline silicate feature suggests that a combination of @xmath8 and metallicity would also fail to increase the crystal fraction . having eliminated @xmath8 , @xmath13 and metallicity as likely causes of higher crystallinity ,",
    "we are left with c / o ratio as the most likely culprit .",
    "the condensation scheme suggested in ",
    "[ dustformmech ] is relevant to solar c / o ( @xmath280.48 ) .",
    "oxygen - rich agb stars have c / o ratios between 0.4 and 0.8 , where the exact value depends on both the initial mass and age of the star ; increasing this ratio decreases the availability of oxygen atoms with which to make dust .    the mg / si ratio in the circumstellar outflow from which the dust forms is close to unity .",
    "the silica - poor composition of the amorphous dust requires sequestration of some silicon into a non - silicate phase to increase the mg / si ratio ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the formation of gehlenite ( ca@xmath1al@xmath1sio@xmath29 ) before the mg - rich silicates is predicted in many condensation models ( e.g *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , si / ca @xmath416 , and thus gehlenite is not an effective sink for silicon atoms .    other options would be keeping the si in gas phase sio ; or condensation of si into a metallic ( or other featureless ) phase ( e.g. fesi ) .",
    "the predicted path by which mgsio@xmath3 forms is a reaction of mg@xmath1sio@xmath2 with sio gas , requiring an additional oxygen atom .",
    "consequently , high c / o may limit the conversion of mg@xmath1sio@xmath2 into mgsio@xmath3 and preserve a silica - poor mineralogy .",
    "the condensation of fesi is predicted for c / o ratios @xmath300.65 @xcite . as c / o approaches unity , t@xmath31 for the mg - silicates decreases",
    "rapidly @xcite and si is more apt to be incorporated into fesi @xcite . for c / o @xmath30 0.85 , the mg - silicate dust formation temperature drops to below that of fesi @xcite , which results in sequestration of si and increases the mg / si ratio of the gas from which the silicates form .",
    "therefore , there are at least two mechanisms by which higher c / o ratios may be able to explain the composition of i17495 .    based on the preceding arguments we suggest that a high c / o ratio is the cause of the unusual mineralogy of i17495 .",
    "our hypothesis predicts several observable correlations : ( 1 ) between the strength of sio absorption and c / o ratio in low @xmath8 stars ; ( 2 ) between sio absorption and the relative abundances of crystalline forsterite and enstatite in high @xmath8 stars ; and ( 3 ) between c / o and the peak positions / fwhm of the classic 10@xmath9 m ( emission ) feature . as discussed in   [ rtmod ] the peak position and fwhm of the 10@xmath9 m feature depend on the composition of the amorphous silicate .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between agb / post - agb star crystallinity and source morphology , with `` disk - like '' sources having a higher degree of crystallinity than spherical sources .",
    "@xcite suggested that this correlation is due to low - temperature crystallization in a long - lived disk .",
    "however , the inference of a disk around highly crystalline sources comes from imaging and the general shape of the sed , which can not distinguish between a keplerian disk and a toroidal outflow .",
    "there is evidence that the last stages of mass loss from agb stars become increasing toroidal , and that this effect is stronger the more massive the progenitor star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this case",
    ", the density / pressure in the dust - forming regions would be enhanced further by the concentration of material into the star s equatorial region , leading to conditions more apt to form crystalline structures .",
    "this in turn would correlate degree of crystallinity with initial mass of the star .",
    "only massive agb stars would produce significant amounts of crystalline material , and these are significantly rarer than low mass agb stars .",
    "this resolves the conundrum of the ism ( having low crystallinity ) being enriched by high crystallinity sources ( see   [ intro ] ) .",
    "we have presented the first crystalline silicate absorption feature observed to date .",
    "the spectrum of i17495 is enigmatic and suggests that its dust is dominated by mg@xmath1sio@xmath2 in both the crystalline and amorphous phases .",
    "we have confirmed that high mass - loss rates should produce more crystalline material than low mass - loss rates ; and that the crystalline mineralogy should be increasingly dominated by forsterite as mass - loss rates increase .",
    "the most likely factor controlling both crystallinity and mineralogy is the c / o ratio .",
    "we suggest that the correlation between crystallinity , mass - loss rate and initial stellar mass mitigates the problem of the very different crystal fractions observed in some agb stars and in the ism . only the rarer , higher mass agb stars contribute a significant amount of crystalline material to the ism .",
