    "two telescopes , t2 and t3 , were operational at this time , with t3 located 100 m to the south - south - east of t2 . the data from each telescope were recorded with the trigger condition requiring that more than four pixels exceeded 7.6  p.e .",

    ", we combine these datasets by comparing the gps timing . the distribution of timing differences is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_gps ] .",
    "the broadness of the distribution was due to the time resolution of the gps clocks .",
    "we required an off - line coincidence between the two telescopes trigger times within @xmath4100@xmath14s .",
    "events outside this time window were considered to be accidental coincidences .",
    "the trigger rates of the individual telescopes were at most 80hz and this was reduced to 8hz by requiring the above coincidence .",

    "electromagnetic showers can be accurately simulated by computer code and cosmic ray showers can be observed in off - source observations and generated using monte - carlo codes such as geant .",
    "we measured the point spread function ( psf ) and reflectivity of each mirror segment during their production and the quantum efficiency of each photomultiplier ( pmt ) pixel was also measured . some deterioration in these values after the construction of the telescope is inevitable , and was monitored by regular psf measurements of bright stars .",
    "light collection efficiencies were monitored via optical systems such as photo - diodes and commercial ccd cameras observing stars both directly , and after reflection by the mirrors .",
    "these showed gradual degradation in the form of broadening spot sizes and decreasing reflectivities .",
    "however , these data only relate to the reflectors , and we need to know the total performance of the whole system including the cameras .    in order to measure these , we need `` standard candles '' ; sources of cherenkov photons or non - variable gamma - ray sources such as the crab nebula . here",

    "sub - tev cosmic rays produce hadronic showers in the upper atmosphere at a depth of around three inelastic interaction lengths , corresponding to an altitude of @xmath010 km .",
    "secondary hadrons are produced and interact further , with only gamma - rays , electrons and muons surviving to near ground level .",
    "of these , relativistic muons radiate cherenkov rings near the earth s surface , and these produce distinct complete or partial ring images on the camera .",
    "the contribution of these rings to the trigger rate of our telescopes is critical , because small cherenkov images resemble gamma - ray images .",
    "local muon ring images can , however , be removed by requiring the coincidence of two or more telescopes separated by @xmath0100 m . here , for calibration , we select images produced by muons at altitudes of 100200 m .",
    "this can be done by selecting a somewhat larger  arc - length \" .",
    "arc - length is measured after fitting a circle to the images , and is the fitted radius multiplied by the recorded opening angle of the image .",
    "if larger images are required , we can simply restrict the selection to geometrically closer images such as those with altitudes @xmath15100200 m .",
    "the inverse of the radius ( curvature ) should have a gaussian distribution , so we therefore plot the curvature as a solid histogram in fig .",

    "there is some dependence of light yield on the atmospheric temperature ; however , this is monitored and recorded every second .",
    "the night - time temperature near woomera ranges from near 0c in winter to over 30c in summer .",
    "the systematic error , which includes the reflectivity of the present mirror , the psf , and the quantum efficiency of the pmts , is thought to be at the 5% level of the total light collection efficiency .",

    "they also noted that no gamma - rays were detected from the vela pulsar , and placed a tight upper limit on the pulsar flux at 0.26tev @xcite .",

    "gamma - ray  like events can be extracted by fitting position - by - position @xmath53 distributions under the assumption that gamma - rays obey the monte - carlo predictions , the proton background follows the average @xmath53 distribution of all directions , and the total distribution is a linear combination of those two .",

    "the curve shown is the predicted distribution for the 23 degrees of freedom .",
    "there is good agreement , i.e. , there is no significant directional dependence .",
    "this method was then checked with crab nebula data .",
    "the @xmath53 distributions at various @xmath17 slices were taken at energies greater than 5.7tev .",
    "the background @xmath53 distribution was obtained in the higher @xmath17 region , 0.10.3  degree@xmath2 .",
    "the only fitting parameter is the percentage of gamma - ray  like events relative to the total events .",

    "[ crab ] .",
    "the statistical significance of the peak is 4.0@xmath3 , while the ordinary wobble analysis gave a 3.6@xmath3 excess .",

    "the angular resolution ( 0.23  degree ) is significantly worse than that of h.e.s.s .",

    "this excess is below the 5@xmath3 level generally required for a firm detection @xcite and is spatially extended over a significant portion of our field of view , and thus a high resolution ( 0.1 degree ) morphology map is not justified .",
    "we are , however , able to offer supporting evidence of the h.e.s.s .",
    "result and , in this light , are planning to observe the pwn region in more detail next year .",
    "we have observed the vela pulsar region from 2004 january 17 to february 25 with the cangaroo - iii stereoscopic imaging cherenkov telescopes . at that time ,",

    "calibration was performed using muon rings and the performance of the telescopes confirmed with observations of the crab nebula .",
    "the estimated energy threshold for this analysis was 600gev .",
    "the use of the fisher discriminant has been introduced and a template for cangaroo - iii analysis presented .",
    "no significant excess of events was found from the vela pulsar direction or from the peak of the emission detected with the cangaroo - i telescope .",
    "the upper limits obtained are a factor of five less than the cangaroo - i fluxes ( assuming an @xmath27 spectrum ) .",
    "in addition , we have confirmed , at the 4@xmath3 level the gamma - ray emission recently reported from the vela pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the tev emission from the pwn peaks @xmath00.5 degree south of the pulsar position and has a @xmath00.6 degree extension , consistent with the h.e.s.s .",
    "a detailed morphological study of this source will require more observations .",

    "we thank the defense support center woomera and bae systems .",
    "observations of the crab nebula were carried out over the period 2003 december 18 to 28 .",
    "the observations were made using the so - called  wobble mode \" in which the pointing position of each telescope was alternated between @xmath40.5  degree in declination from the center of the crab nebula every 20 minutes @xcite .",
    "two telescopes , t2 and t3 , were operational at this time .",
    "t3 is located 100 m to the south - south - east of t2 , which is not ideal for observations of northern sources ; however sufficient data was recorded for a useful analysis to be made .",
    "the trigger rates of the individual telescopes were at most 80hz and this was reduced to 8hz by requiring the above coincidence .",
    "the total observation time was 1122min .",
    "next we required both telescopes to have clusters of pmts with five adjacent hits above a 5p.e .",
    "hit threshold , which reduced the event rate to 6hz .",
    "looking at the time dependence of this event rate , we can remove data taken in cloudy conditions .",
    "this procedure is exactly the same as the `` cloud cut '' used in cangaroo - ii analysis @xcite .",
