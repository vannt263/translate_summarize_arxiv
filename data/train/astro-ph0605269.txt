    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies have been measured with very high accuracy by wmap @xcite .",
    "such a barrage of new data seldom brings only confirmation of known theories and mechanisms , and wmap is no exception : lack of higher correlations @xcite and some curious correlations between large - scale anisotropies are some of the most intriguing questions that have been raised by the wmap data . in particular , two problems have been pointed with present cmb observations , using a wide variety of data , methods , maps and sky - cuts : first , that the quadrupole ( @xmath2 ) has a lower - than - expected signal @xcite .",
    "second , that the quadrupole and octopole ( @xmath3 ) present an unexpectedly high degree of alignment @xcite .",
    "the combined statistics of these effects implies that our cmb sky is only within the @xmath4 0,01% of randomly - generated maps with such anomalous quadrupole and octopole .",
    "it is important to note , first , that these large - angle anomalies were already present in the cobe data @xcite , and they were confirmed by wmap both in the 1-year and in the 3-year data releases @xcite .",
    "second , even though the amplitude of the octopole @xmath5 has increased in the three - year compared to the first - year wmap data , the statistical relevance of the deviant multipoles @xmath2 and @xmath3 has remained practically unchanged in the newly released three - year wmap data @xcite , whereas the outliers of the first - year data @xcite around @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 have either disappeared or become much less of a source of concern in the 3-year data .",
    "these large - angle anomalies have motivated many ingenious explanations , such as compact topologies @xcite , a broken or supressed spectrum at large scales @xcite and oscillations superimposed on the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations @xcite . when the low value of the quadrupole is combined with the alignment of the directions defined by these two multipoles ( their `` normal planes ''  see @xcite ) , the overall chance of such a statistical fluctuation is approximately 0.005% - 0.02% depending on the map and on the mask ",
    "i.e. , only about one in 10000 randomly generated models have a lower @xmath9 _ and _ a more aligned quadrupole and octopole than the observed cmb sky .",
    "as first noted by de oliveira - costa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the directions preferred by the quadrupole and the octopole point roughly towards the virgo cluster  which is in the general vicinity of the dipole and the equinox , and has been dubbed the `` axis of evil '' @xcite .",
    "these large - scale anisotropies appear when one compares the northern / western galactic hemisphere ( where virgo and most of the local supercluster lie ) with the southern / eastern hemisphere @xcite as well .",
    "unusually high correlations with the ecliptic have also been reported @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate whether these large - scale anomalies can be due to extended ( large - angle ) foregrounds that have so far escaped detection . in particular , we re - examine a speculation by abramo & sodr @xcite that the explanation for the observed properties of the quadrupole and octopole is a diffuse , large - angle cmb foreground spatially correlated with the region of the sky occupied by the local supercluster ( lsc )  which is a spot roughly @xmath10 centered around virgo , at @xmath11 .",
    "the peak temperature of this foreground would have to be of order @xmath12k , with a root - mean - square average temperature of order @xmath13k .",
    "such a foreground would have the correct geometry to affect the quadrupole and octopole in a positive way , erasing their alignments and significantly increasing the amplitude of the quadrupole .",
    "one of the physical processes that could produce such a foreground is the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) due to hot electrons in the intra - supercluster ( isc ) medium @xcite . for the range of frequencies observed by wmap and cobe",
    ", the isc gas causes an apparent decrease in the temperature of the cmb photons in the direction of the lsc .",
    "we have estimated , using a simplified model , that a temperature distortion as high as @xmath14 @xmath15k is marginally consistent with present constraints on the isc medium and with spectral distortions of the cmb .",
    "the possibility that foregrounds could be responsible for the alignments was also noted in @xcite , and two recently related explanations were proposed by rakic , rasanen and schwarz @xcite and by inoue and silk @xcite .",
    "al . studied the rees - sciama effect due to a nearby large - scale structure ( or structures ) , and found that the ensuing foreground could be as high as @xmath16k , but that the phases were not right to eliminate the alignments and the low quadrupole .",
    "inoue and silk , on the other hand , speculate that the non - gaussian cold spot in the southern galactic hemisphere @xcite could be caused by voids in the nearby large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "they conclude that the contribution from compensated pairs of voids would have the right phases to account for the low amplitude of the quadrupole and the for the unusual quadrupole - octopole alignment .",
    "notice that , because the quadrupole is even under parity transformations @xmath17 , any given pattern has the same quadrupole components as its specular image .",
    "since the effect discussed here relies mostly on a distortion of the quadrupole ( which is both low - amplitude and has fewer phases than the octopole ) , this partly explains the apparent equivalence between the foreground proposed by abramo & sodr and foregrounds located in the southern galactic hemisphere , such as those proposed by inoue & silk .",
    "furthermore , because most of the power of the observed cmb quadrupole lies in its @xmath18 and @xmath19 components , another probable spot for an extended foreground corresponds to the location of virgo , rotated @xmath20 around the galactic poles axis  that is , @xmath21 .    by placing one of these hypothetical foregrounds ( henceforth hfg ) on random locations , removing it from a cmb map and then computing the likelihood of the  cleaned \" map , we have been able to test the randomness of the spatial correlation with the four dual points described above .",
    "we find that , in all maps and in all foreground models tested , the most probable places for them are indeed either the vicinities of @xmath22 , @xmath23 or near the ecliptic poles",
    ".    we will show that , of all possible locations for this hfg , the lsc and its dual points produce the most significant improvements in the likelihoods of the cmb maps , by both increasing the ( too low ) level of the quadrupole @xmath9 and by weakening the ( too high ) quadrupole - octopole alignment .",
    "this can be achieved with hfg s whose rms temperatures lie in the range @xmath24k and quadrupoles @xmath25k@xmath1 , depending on the model .",
    "we have analysed the wmap ( 1-year and 3-year ) internal linear combination maps @xcite ( henceforth ilc ) , the map of tegmark _ et _ al . @xcite ( henceforth toh ) , as well as the co - added maps based on 1-year and 3-year wmap data ( henceforth coadded ) for the ilc and coadded maps we use the kp2 maks , and for the toh map we use the masks m0 and m6 described in @xcite . in all cases the low value of the quadrupole and the alignments are robust , and",
    "removal of the hfg leads to dramatic increases in the likelihoods of the cmb maps .",
    "this strongly argues in favour of still unknown diffuse , large - angle structures around the dipole axis that may be affecting the cmb .    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we summarize the multipole vector formalism and the statistics of alignments for cmb maps . in sec .",
    "iii we present a model of the hfg based on the lsc , and argue that it may be due to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect caused by hot gas in the intra - supercluster medium . in sec .",
    "iv we consider the spatial location of the foreground , and show that the association with the dipole axis is not an accident .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "katz and weeks @xcite have described , in a beautiful paper , how to compute all multipole vectors given the spherical harmonic components @xmath26  see also @xcite .",
    "the multipole vectors , introduced to cmb data analysis by copi _",
    "@xcite , are essentially eigenvectors of a simple set of algebraic equation whose parameters are the multipole components .",
    "very similar computations were conducted using other ( usually numeric ) methods in @xcite to find these vectors .",
    "the idea , which goes back to j. c. maxwell in the xix@xmath27 century , is that the multipole decomposition of a field on @xmath28 implies that for each moment @xmath29 there are @xmath29 eigenvectors of norm unity , @xmath30 .",
    "the bottom line of the multipole vector analysis is that the expansion in spherical harmonics is equivalent to an expansion in multipole vectors : [ expansions ] = _",
    "m=-^a_m y_m ( , ) = d__p=1^^(,p ) ( , ) - z_-1 ( , ) , where @xmath31 just subtracts the residual @xmath32 total angular momentum parts of the product expansion , and is irrelevant to our analysis ",
    "see @xcite for an enhanced discussion of the multipole vector expansion .",
    "notice that , contrary to the @xmath33 s , which are always positive - definite , the @xmath34 s can be either negative or positive .",
    "this means that the multipole vectors @xmath30 define only directions @xcite , hence they are in fact  vectors without arrowheads \" .",
    "it can also be seen from the expansion above that , whenever using the multipole vectors to test for alignments , it is irrelevant what the amplitudes of the multipoles are ",
    "just their ( complex ) phases matter , of which there are @xmath29 for each multipole .",
    "starting with these @xmath29 multipole vectors one can also construct @xmath35 normal vectors  or normal planes .",
    "therefore , for @xmath2 there are 2 multipole vectors ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and only one normal plane ( @xmath38 ) ; for @xmath3 there are 3 multipole vectors and 3 normal planes ; and so forth .",
    "notice that , because the multipole vectors are not necessarily orthogonal , the normal vectors need not be ( and generally are not ) of norm unity",
    ".    we can therefore check for  alignments \" between either the multipole vector themselves , or between the normal planes .",
    "two widely used tests that check for alignments of the quadrupole and octopole normal planes are the @xmath39 statistic : [ def : s ] s 13 | ^(2,1 ) ^(3,1 ) | + | ^(2,1 ) ^(3,2 ) | + | ^(2,1 ) ^(3,3 ) | , and the @xmath40 statistic , which is analogous to @xmath39 but disregards the norm of the normal vectors : [ def : d ] d 13 | ^(2,1 ) ^(3,1 ) | + | ^(2,1 ) ^(3,2 ) | + | ^(2,1 ) ^(3,3 ) | . it can be easily seen that both @xmath39 and @xmath40 lie within the interval @xmath41 . in",
    "what follows we will use mostly the @xmath39 statistic , since the @xmath40 statistic disregards the norm of the normal vector and therefore throws away some information about the system . for the higher multipoles",
    "this may not be much of an issue , but the quadrupole has only 2 complex phases ( 4 effective degrees of freedom ) and we would like to retain as much of that phase information as possible .",
    "normalized p.d.f.s for the @xmath39 statistic ( left panel ) and @xmath40 statistic ( right panel ) , found by simulating @xmath42 mock maps , binned in intervals of 0.01.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   normalized p.d.f.s for the @xmath39 statistic ( left panel ) and @xmath40 statistic ( right panel ) , found by simulating @xmath42 mock maps , binned in intervals of 0.01.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    one can easily compute the probability distribution functions ( p.d.f.s ) for @xmath39 and @xmath40 using randomly - generated ( `` mock '' ) maps , either by simulating maps , computing the harmonic components and then the vectors and alignments , or by directly simulating the harmonic components , which are gaussian random numbers with dispersion given by @xmath43 . because the alignments do not depend on the @xmath44 s , but only on the phases between the @xmath26 s , one need not adjust the level of the @xmath44 for each @xmath29  all that is needed to test for the alignments in mock maps is the fact that the phases are random within each multipole .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the normalized p.d.f.s for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 tests that were computed using 300.000 mock maps . as mentioned above , in what follows we will use mostly the @xmath39 statistic , but we note that the @xmath40 statistic gives similar results . for a complete treatment of statistical tests of isotropy ,",
    "their p.d.f.s , and an assessment of other sources of error see @xcite .      given a cmb map ,",
    "the harmonic components can be easily extracted ( we use healpix @xcite ) , and the multipole vectors and their statistics can be easily computed .",
    "there are several maps to choose from , the most well - known being the coadded , ilc , lilc , toh and the q- , v- and w - band frequency maps . for all except the toh map ( which is already cleaned ) we have use",
    "the kp2 mask based on three - year wmap data @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that the relativistic doppler correction to the quadrupole is an important factor that must be subtracted from the maps , since it corresponds to a non - primary source of the quadrupole @xcite .    in table",
    "i we present the quadrupoles and their alignments with the octopoles , for a few cmb maps .",
    "the coadded and ilc maps use 3-year wmap data , while the toh map uses the first - year wmap data only . the alignments are robust in all maps , as has been noted by @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will construct a model foreground based on the lsc , and table i presents the statistical effect of the subtraction of this lsc - shaped foreground .",
    "notice that the relative error for the probabilities can be estimated as @xmath45 .",
    ".[table1 ] quadrupoles and alignments of cmb maps with and without the hypothetical lsc foreground subtracted . shown",
    "are the coadded and ilc maps with the 3-year kp2 mask @xcite , and the toh map with and without the mask described in @xcite ( based on first year wmap data ) .",
    "@xmath46 is the probability that a random map has quadrupole as low as @xmath9 , and @xmath47 is the probability that a random map has a quadrupole - octopole alignment as high as @xmath39 .",
    "also shown ( last column ) is the unbiased joint probability @xmath48 , which estimates the likelihood that a random map has an anomalous ( too high or too low ) quadrupole _ and _ an anomalous ( too high or too low ) quadrupole - octopole alignment . in all cases ,",
    "removal of the foreground leads to an improvement of about two orders of magnitude in @xmath49 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it can be seen from figs .",
    "5 - 16 that , in most cases , there is a strong clustering of the preferred locations around virgo ( and the lsc ) , its diametrically opposite point , and the region which correspons to virgo rotated @xmath20 around the @xmath50-axis .",
    "the preferred locations seem to be more scattered for the 3-year coadded map with both foreground models , and for the ilc maps with the hfg - lsc model .",
    "there is a simple explanation for the spatial distribution seen throughout figs . 5 - 16 : the hfg s change @xmath51 mostly by amplifying and rotating the quadrupole of the original maps . but",
    "the quadrupole is even under parity transformations @xmath17 , therefore from the point of view of the quadrupole , it is irrelevant if the foreground is at the lsc or at its diametrically opposite side .",
    "moreover , since most of the power of the quadrupole lies in its @xmath52 and @xmath53 components , a rotation by @xmath20 degrees effects very little change to it . therefore ,",
    "if the foreground which is distorting the cmb is indeed at the lsc , then its preferred locations in a blind search will degenerate to not only the vicinity of the lsc itself , at @xmath11 , but also to its  dual points \" at @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this is indeed what seems to happen for most maps  see table 2 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , even though the amplitude of the octopole of the hfg - lsc model is subdominant , in the hfg - d model there is a substantial change in the octupole after the subtraction . although the impact of the octopole in @xmath51 is small , there are other statistical tests which are sensitive to it  in particular , the @xmath56 statistic of copi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which tests for an alignment of the quadrupole and octopole with the ecliptic plane .",
    "the 3-year coadded and ilc maps have too high values of @xmath56 at @xmath57 c.l . after subtracting the best - fit disk foreground model ,",
    "those values come down to @xmath58 c.l . for the coadded map and to @xmath59",
    "for the ilc map .      if the hfg indeed exists , it may be possible to detect correlations in the higher @xmath29 components as well .",
    "however , depending on the model , the spectrum of the foreground can decay with large @xmath29 , and the increasing number of phases means that these correlations will probably difficult to detect .",
    "if the foreground is homogeneous ( as in the disk model ) , the higher multipoles can also become important and their presence may affect the alignments between , say , @xmath60 .    it is trivial to generalize the tests of eqs .",
    "( [ def : s])-([def : d ] ) for higher multipoles  see , e.g. , @xcite . if a given foreground cures the quadrupole level and the quadrupole - octopole alignment at the cost of introducing anomalous alignments between other multipoles , then the overall likelihood of the resulting map should fall . on the other hand ,",
    "if the original cmb map has another anomalous alignment which is relaxed because of the hypothetical foreground , then the likelihood of the resulting map increases even further .",
    "we have tested the maps of table ii for signs of anomalous alignments between the higher multipoles using an unbiased probability with 38 tests , @xmath61  which includes the level of the quadrupole and the quadrupole - octopole alignment @xcite .",
    "the results are mixed , and probably reveal intrinsic differences between the maps , masks and foreground models .",
    "for example , whereas the original toh map with the mask 6 @xcite has @xmath62 , subtraction of the best - fit hfg - lsc model leads to an improvement to @xmath63 , while subtraction of the best - fit hfg - d model improves it to @xmath64 . for the coadded map ( 3-year data ) with the kp2 mask @xcite",
    ", the original map has @xmath65 , and after subtracting the best - fit hfg - lsc model it only improves to @xmath66 , while subtraction of the best - fit hfg - d model leads to @xmath67 .",
    "notice that in all cases above , the level of the quadrupole and the quadrupole - octopole alignment alone are responsible for a factor of @xmath68 improvement in @xmath61 for the toh map , and for a factor of @xmath69 improvement in @xmath61 for the ilc map .",
    "we have presented circumstantial evidence that an extended foreground near the dipole axis could be distorting the cmb .",
    "the subtraction of such a foreground increases the quadrupole , removes the ( anomalous ) quadrupole - octopole alignment , and dramatically increases the overall likelihood of the cmb maps .",
    "possible physical mechanisms that could account for this foreground are the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite and the rees - sciama effect @xcite , although it should be noted that both options only work in extreme situations that are probably unrealistic .",
    "another possibility is that a combination of effects is responsible for the foreground .",
    "however , if the sunyaev - zeldovich effect due to the lsc s gas is indeed responsible for the foreground , it could be directly observed by the planck satellite @xcite within the next few years  see also @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the phases of the cmb maps are such that the optimal places for such foregrounds to exist would be around the local supercluster , its specular image , or the site of the local supercluster rotated @xmath20 around the galactic polar axis .",
    "furthermore , of the two foreground models analyzed here , the non - uniform foreground ( hfg - lsc model ) seems preferred by the data as it needs a lower overall temperature distortion in order to improve the likelihood of the cmb maps .",
