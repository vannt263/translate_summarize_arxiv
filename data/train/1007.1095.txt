    "what is the maximum possible number @xmath2 of unit distances determined by an @xmath0-point set in the euclidean plane ?",
    "this tantalizing question , raised by erds @xcite in 1946 , has motivated an extensive research ( see , e.g. , brass , moser , and pach @xcite for a survey ) , but it remains wide open .",
    "erds @xcite proved a lower bound @xmath3 for a constant @xmath4 , attained for the @xmath5 grid , and he conjectured that it has the right order of magnitude ( and in particular , that @xmath6 for every fixed @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , the current best upper bound is only @xmath8 .",
    "it was first proved by spencer , szemerdi , and trotter @xcite , based on the method of szemerdi and trotter @xcite , and several simpler proofs are available by now ( by clarkson et al .",
    "@xcite , by aronov and sharir @xcite , and the simplest one by szkely @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of unit distances has also been considered for norms other than the euclidean one . for a norm",
    "is a mapping that assigns a nonnegative real number @xmath9 to each @xmath10 so that @xmath11 implies @xmath12 , @xmath13 for all @xmath14 , and the triangle inequality holds : @xmath15 . the _ unit ball _ of the norm @xmath16",
    "is the set @xmath17 .",
    "the unit ball of any norm is a closed bounded convex body @xmath18 that is symmetric about @xmath19 and contains @xmath19 in the interior .",
    "conversely , every @xmath20 with the listed properties is the unit ball of a ( uniquely determined ) norm . ]",
    "@xmath16 on @xmath21 , let @xmath22 denote the maximum possible number of unit distances determined by @xmath0 points in @xmath23 .",
    "if the boundary of the unit ball @xmath24 of @xmath16 contains a straight segment , then it is easy to construct @xmath0-point sets with @xmath25 unit distances . on the other hand , if @xmath16 is _ strictly convex _ , meaning that the boundary of @xmath24 contains no straight segment , then @xmath26 , as can be shown by a straightforward generalization of the known proofs for the euclidean case .",
    "valtr @xcite , strengthening an earlier result of brass , constructed a strictly convex norm @xmath16 in the plane with @xmath27 , thus showing that the upper bound can not be improved in general for strictly convex norms .",
    "a simple construction shows that @xmath28 holds for every norm @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we will show that there exists a norm @xmath16 with @xmath29 , almost matching the lower bound .",
    "actually , we show that most norms , in the sense of baire category , have this property .    to formulate this result , we recall the relevant notions .",
    "let @xmath30 be the set of all unit balls of norms in @xmath21 , i.e. , of all closed bounded @xmath19-symmetric convex sets containing @xmath19 in the interior .",
    "endowed with the hausdorff metric of two sets in the euclidean plane is defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , with @xmath33 denoting the euclidean distance . ]",
    "@xmath34 , the set @xmath30 forms a baire space , meaning that each meager set in a metric ( or topological ) space @xmath35 is _ nowhere dense _",
    "if every nonempty open set @xmath36 contains a nonempty open set @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "meager set _ is a countable union of nowhere dense sets . ]",
    "has a dense complement ; see , e.g. , gruber ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  13 ) .",
    "if @xmath39 is some property that a norm on @xmath21 may or may not have , we say that _ most norms have property @xmath39 _ if the ( unit balls of the ) norms not having property @xmath39 form a meager set in @xmath30 .",
    "a similar terminology is commonly used for convex bodies .",
    "if most norms have property @xmath40 and most norms have property @xmath41 , then most norms have both @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( and similarly for countably many properties ) , which makes this approach a powerful tool for proving existence results . starting with a paper of klee @xcite , who proved that most norms are smooth and strictly convex ,",
    "there have been many papers establishing that most norms or most convex bodies have various properties ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we add the following item to this collection .",
    "[ t : ] there exists a constant @xmath42 such that most norms @xmath16 on @xmath21 satisfy @xmath43 for all @xmath44 ( @xmath45 stands for logarithm in base  @xmath46 everywhere in this paper ) .",
    "in particular , there exists a smooth and strictly convex norm @xmath16 with this property .",
    "since , as was mentioned above , @xmath28 for all norms , the bound in the theorem is tight up to the @xmath47 factor .",
    "this factor comes out of a graph - theoretic result , proposition  [ p : ] below , and i have no good guess whether it is really needed .",
    "the proof of the theorem has two main parts .",
    "we begin with the first , purely graph - theoretic part in section  [ s : edgecol ] .",
    "the result needed for the rest of the proof is proposition  [ p : ] , asserting the existence of a certain subgraph in every sufficiently dense graph with a given proper edge - coloring .",
    "its proof relies heavily on a similar result of pvtiv , kovro , and the author @xcite ( but the presentation below is self - contained ) .",
    "then , in section  [ s : udg ] we continue with the second , geometric part of the proof of theorem  [ t : ] .",
    "very roughly speaking , using the graph - theoretic result from the first part of the proof , we show that if there is a set @xmath39 with many unit distances , under any norm , and if @xmath48 are all the mutually non - parallel unit vectors defined by pairs of points of @xmath39 , then there are `` many '' linear dependences among the @xmath49 .",
    "namely , there is an integer @xmath50 , such that some @xmath51 vectors among the @xmath49 can be expressed as linear functions of some other @xmath50 of the @xmath49 ( where the linear functions do nt depend on the norm ) .",
    "finally , we show that most norms do nt admit such linear dependences  this is done by approximating the unit ball of the considered norm by a convex polygon , and employing a linear - algebraic perturbation argument to the lines bounding the polygon",
    ".    it would be interesting to prove a similar result for some narrower class of norms .",
    "for example , one might hope to prove that the @xmath52 norms admit only a near - linear number of unit distances for most @xmath53 ( in the baire category sense or even for almost all @xmath53 w.r.t .",
    "the lebesgue measure ) . for that , the idea of polygonal approximations seems unusable , but perhaps more powerful tools from algebraic geometry might help .    finally , of course , it might be possible to use some pieces from the method of this paper for attacking the euclidean case .",
    "however , since the number of unit distances for the euclidean case can be much larger than @xmath54 , additional ideas are certainly needed .",
    "let @xmath55 be a ( simple , undirected ) graph .",
    "an _ edge coloring _ of @xmath56 is a mapping @xmath57 .",
    "the edge coloring @xmath58 is called _ proper _ if @xmath59 whenever the edges @xmath60 and @xmath61 share a vertex .",
    "let @xmath56 be a graph with a given edge coloring .",
    "for a subset @xmath62 of vertices we let @xmath63 $ ] stand for the subgraph of @xmath56 induced by @xmath64 , with the edge coloring inherited from that of @xmath56 .",
    "further , if @xmath65 is a set of colors , we write @xmath66 $ ] for the subgraph induced by @xmath64 on the edges with colors in @xmath67 , that is , @xmath68=\\bigl(w,\\{\\{u , v\\}\\in e : u , v\\in w , c(e)\\in i\\}\\bigr)\\ ] ] ( the coloring is not explicitly mentioned in the notation ) .",
    "[ p : ] let @xmath69 be a real parameter .",
    "let @xmath55 be a graph on @xmath70 vertices , with at least @xmath71 edges ( where @xmath72 is a suitable absolute constant ) , and with a given proper edge coloring . then there exist a nonempty subset @xmath62 of vertices , @xmath73 , and a subset @xmath74 of colors such that the subgraph @xmath66 $ ] is connected and the edges of @xmath63 $ ] have at least @xmath75 distinct colors .    as was mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "this proposition is similar to a result from @xcite , and the proof is also quite similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "i still consider it worth presenting in full , since describing the required modifications would be clumsy , and moreover , the proof below is significantly simpler than that in @xcite , mainly because the required result is weaker ( in proposition  [ p : ] we obtain a single connected subgraph , while in @xcite several color - disjoint connected subgraphs on the same vertex set were needed ) .    at the beginning of the proof ,",
    "we use a well - known observation stating that every graph of average degree @xmath76 has a subgraph whose minimum degree is at least @xmath77 ( this follows by repeatedly deleting vertices of degree below @xmath77 and checking that the average degree ca nt decrease ) .",
    "so we may assume that @xmath56 has minimum degree at least @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a subset of vertices of @xmath56 ( so far arbitrary ) .",
    "an _ edge cut _ in @xmath63 $ ] is a partition @xmath78 of @xmath64 into two nonempty subsets .",
    "we define the _ maximum degree _",
    "@xmath79 of such an edge cut as the maximum number of neighbors of a vertex from @xmath80 in @xmath18 or of a vertex from @xmath18 in @xmath80 ; formally , @xmath81    the proof of proposition  [ p : ] proceeds in two stages .",
    "in the first stage , we forget about the edge colors ; we select the set @xmath64 so that every edge cut in @xmath63 $ ] has a sufficiently large maximum degree . in order to get the ( almost tight ) quantitative result in the proposition",
    ", we need to quantify the `` sufficiently large maximum degree '' of a cut depending on the _ imbalance _ of the cut , which is defined by @xmath82    [ l : coloredcuts ] let @xmath83 be a parameter ( which we will later set to @xmath84 in the application of the lemma ) , and let @xmath55 be a graph on @xmath85 vertices of minimum degree at least @xmath86 .",
    "then there exists @xmath62 , @xmath73 , such that every edge cut @xmath78 in @xmath63 $ ] satisfies @xmath87    * proof . *",
    "the proof proceeds by a recursive partitioning : as long as we can find an edge cut @xmath78 of small maximum degree in the current graph , we discard the _",
    "larger _ of the sets @xmath88 .",
    "more formally , we set @xmath89 . if @xmath90 $ ] has already been constructed and if there is an edge cut @xmath91 in @xmath90 $ ] with @xmath92 , we let @xmath93 be the smaller of the sets @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( ties broken arbitrarily ) and iterate . if there is no such edge cut , we set @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and finish .",
    "it remains to show that the resulting @xmath64 is nontrivial , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "this is clear for @xmath98 ( no partition step was made ) , so we assume @xmath99 .",
    "we show that @xmath63=g[v_t]$ ] has minimum degree at least  @xmath100 , and thus @xmath64 ca nt consist of a single vertex .    initially , in @xmath56 , each vertex has degree at least @xmath101 , and by passing from @xmath102 to @xmath93 , each vertex of @xmath93 loses at most @xmath92 neighbors .",
    "thus , the minimum degree in @xmath103 $ ] is strictly larger than @xmath104 the lemma is proved .    50 @xmath105 = 0",
    "now we continue with the _ second stage of the proof of proposition  [ p:]_. only here we start considering the edge colors .    according to lemma  [ l : coloredcuts ] ,",
    "we now assume that @xmath62 , @xmath73 , is such that every edge cut @xmath78 in @xmath63 $ ] has maximum degree at least @xmath106 , with @xmath107 . consequently , the edges of every edge cut @xmath78 have at least @xmath106 distinct colors ( since the edge coloring is proper ) , and this is the only property of @xmath63 $ ] we will use .",
    "let @xmath108 denote the number of colors occurring on the edges of @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "we note that @xmath109 ( this follows by using the condition above for an arbitrary cut ) .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath63 $ ] has a connected subgraph that uses at most @xmath110 colors .",
    "we select the colors greedily one by one , as follows .",
    "we set @xmath111 , and for @xmath112 we do the following : if @xmath113 $ ] is connected , we set @xmath114 and finish . otherwise , we let @xmath115 be a color @xmath116 minimizing the number of connected components of @xmath117 $ ] . then we set @xmath118 , and we continue with the next step . we need to show that we obtain a connected graph before exhausting more than @xmath110 colors .",
    "let @xmath119 be the number of connected components of @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "we want an upper bound on the smallest @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "first we observe that @xmath123 for all @xmath121 , since every edge cut contains at least one color . in the sequel , we will actually estimate the smallest @xmath121 such that @xmath124 . then at most two more steps suffice to get down to @xmath122 .",
    "we now want to bound @xmath125 in terms of @xmath119 .",
    "essentially , we will see that adding a random color to @xmath126 is likely to connect up many components .",
    "let @xmath127 be the vertex sets of the connected components of @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "the average number of vertices in a component is @xmath128 ; we call a component _ small _ if it has at most @xmath129 vertices . by markov",
    "s inequality , there are at least @xmath130 small components .",
    "let @xmath116 be one of the colors occurring on the edges of @xmath63 $ ] but not belonging to @xmath126 ( so there are @xmath131 possible choices for @xmath116 ) .",
    "we say that a component @xmath132 _ gets connected _ by @xmath116 if there is an edge of color @xmath116 connecting a vertex of @xmath132 to a vertex outside @xmath132 .    by the condition on the edge cuts of @xmath63 $ ] ,",
    "if @xmath132 is a small component , then the number of colors @xmath116 by which @xmath132 gets connected is at least @xmath133 thus , the expected number of small components that get connected by a random color is at least @xmath134 so at least this many components get connected by the color @xmath135 .",
    "it is easy to check that the number of components always decreases at least by half of the number of components that get connected ( an extremal case being components merged in pairs ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath136 ( we used @xmath137 in the last step ) .",
    "assuming , as we may , that @xmath138 , we have @xmath139 , and so @xmath140 since @xmath141 , we can see that @xmath119 drops below @xmath142 in at most @xmath143 steps .",
    "we need at most two extra colors to get all the way to @xmath122 , so altogether the number of colors needed to build a connected graph is @xmath144 ( since @xmath109 , and thus @xmath145 ) .",
    "the implicit constant in the @xmath146 notation is independent of @xmath72 , and thus we can set @xmath72 so large that the number of colors is at most @xmath110 .",

    "box _ @xmath272 as a product of closed intervals with a nonempty interior ; each box can be written as an @xmath219-dimensional `` interval '' @xmath273 $ ] .",
    "our next goal is establishing the following claim .",
    "[ c : laim ] there exists a box @xmath274 such that and for every admissible assignment of lines @xmath259 and for every @xmath275 there are no vectors @xmath276 such that each @xmath49 lies on the appropriate line , i.e. , @xmath277 , and the @xmath49 satisfy the linear relations @xmath255 , @xmath256 .",
    "we will kill all admissible assignments @xmath259 one by one inductively , progressively shrinking the current box .",
    "the following statement allows us to make an inductive step : _ let @xmath272 be a box , and let @xmath259 be an admissible assignment of lines .",
    "then there exists a box @xmath278 such that for every @xmath279 there are no vectors @xmath276 with @xmath277 for all @xmath116 and with @xmath255 , @xmath256 . _      for each @xmath283 , the condition @xmath284 translates to a single linear equation for @xmath285 , of the form @xmath286 , where the coefficient vector @xmath287 on the left - hand side does nt depend on @xmath261 , while @xmath288 is a _ nonconstant _ linear function of @xmath289 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath256 , the condition @xmath290 together with @xmath255 translate to a similar linear equation @xmath291 , again with @xmath292 independent of @xmath261 and with @xmath293 a nonconstant linear function of @xmath294 .",
    "since the @xmath295 are all distinct , altogether we get that if the appropriate @xmath254 exist , then @xmath285 satisfies the system @xmath296 of @xmath297 linear equations with @xmath298 unknowns , where @xmath80 is a fixed matrix and the right - hand side @xmath299 is a _ surjective _ linear function @xmath300 .",
    "since we have more equations than unknowns , the system @xmath296 has a solution only for @xmath301 contained in a proper linear subspace of @xmath302 .",
    "hence , by the surjectivity of @xmath303 , the set of all @xmath304 for which @xmath305 is unsolvable is a dense open subset of @xmath306 . from this",
    "the existence of the desired box @xmath307 follows , and the claim  [ c : laim ] is proved .",
    "let us consider the box @xmath308 $ ] as in claim  [ c : laim ] .",
    "we set @xmath309 , and we consider the polygons @xmath310 , @xmath311 , and @xmath312 ; see fig .",
    "[ f : polygs ] .",
    "we claim that @xmath18 is as in the lemma , i.e. , no @xmath313 sufficiently close to @xmath18 belongs to @xmath214 .",
    "to see this , we note that every @xmath314 sufficiently close to @xmath18 satisfies @xmath315 . for contradiction",
    ", we assume that there is an @xmath217-separated realization of @xmath172 under @xmath314 .",
    "then the unit directions @xmath254 lie on the boundary of @xmath314 .",
    "the region @xmath316 is naturally divided into @xmath247 trapezoids @xmath317 belonging to the sides , as in fig .  [",
    "f : polygs1 ] .",
    "each of @xmath49 , @xmath318 , lies in one of these trapezoids , let us call it @xmath319 ( border disputes resolved arbitrarily ) .",
    "since the considered realization is @xmath217-separated , no two of the @xmath49 share the same trapezoid , and also no two of these trapezoids are opposite to one another .",
    "so @xmath259 defines an admissible assignment of sides .",
    "let us consider the trapezoid @xmath319 .",
    "as the line @xmath320 moves from the inner position ( with @xmath321 ) to the outer position ( with @xmath322 ) , it sweeps the whole of @xmath319 , and hence for some @xmath239 it contains @xmath49 ; let us denote this value of @xmath239 by @xmath323 .",
    "this defines @xmath297 of the components of a vector @xmath324 .",
    "let us set the remaining components to the corresponding components of @xmath325 , say .",
    "then @xmath326 lies in the box @xmath327 , and hence , by claim  [ c : laim ] , @xmath254 can not lie on the corresponding lines .",
    "the resulting contradiction proves the lemma , and this also finishes the proof of theorem  [ t : ] ."
