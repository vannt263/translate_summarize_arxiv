    "the vector ( @xmath5 ) and axial - vector ( @xmath6 ) current - current correlators are fundamental quantities of the strong - interaction physics , sensitive to small- and large - distance dynamics .",

    "the difference of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 correlation functions is very sensitive to the details of the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "in particular , the behavior of this combination is constrained by the chiral symmetry in the form of sum rules obtained through the use of the optical theorem @xcite .",
    "the experimental separation of the @xmath17 and @xmath6 spectral functions allows us to accurately test the chiral sum rules in the measured interval @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the taylor expansion of the correlators at @xmath18 are expressed in terms of the low - energy constants of the chiral perturbation theory(@xmath19pt)gasleut85 . on the other hand ,",
    "the large-@xmath20 behavior of the correlators can be confronted with perturbative qcd thanks to the sufficiently large value of the @xmath2 mass . in the high-@xmath20 limit @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "are dominated by the free - field correlator , corrected by nonperturbative terms with inverse powers of @xmath23 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the correlators can be represented by an operator product expansion ( ope ) series and thus are sensitive to the nonperturbative physics at smaller energy scales @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in the ope expansion has been revived due to a possible appearance of unconventional quadratic power corrections , @xmath24 , found in @xcite , and also observed in lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "the aleph and opal data have been intensely used in the literature in order to place limits on the leading coefficients of the @xmath19pt and ope expansions ( see , _ e.g _ , davier:1998dz , ioffe , geshkenbein:2002ri , shuryak , klevansky:1997dk , derafael:2002tj ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to calculate the nonperturbative parts of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 current - current correlators in the kinematic region reaching up to moderately large euclidean @xmath23 and to extract experimentally observed characteristics .",
    "the calculations are carried out in the effective chiral model with nonlocal quark - quark interactions , which is made covariant by the inclusion of the @xmath0-exponents in the non - local interaction vertex .",

    "iii , follows exactly ref .",
    "@xcite . that way the model is made consistent with the gauge invariance and can be used to analyze the @xmath5 and @xmath25 correlators .",
    "the model is a nonlocal extension of the well - known nambu - jona lasinio model .",
    "moreover , its nonlocal structure may be motivated by fundamental qcd interactions induced by the instanton and gluon exchanges , which induce the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry and generate dynamically a momentum - dependent quark mass . from the point of view of the standard ope , the whole series of power corrections characterizes nonlocal properties of the qcd vacuum and may be described in terms of the nonlocal vacuum condensates @xcite .",
    "the use of a covariant nonlocal low - energy quark model based on the self - consistent approach to the dynamics of quarks has many attractive features , as it preserves the gauge invariance , is consistent with the low - energy theorems , as well as takes into account the large - distance dynamics controlled by the bound states .",
    "similar models with nonlocal four - quark interaction have been considered earlier in , _",
    "e.g. _ , dp86,tern91,ibgross92,roberts : dr , birse95,dolt98,bron99,bled , golli , prasza and applied to describe various low - energy phenomena .",
    "nonlocal models have an important feature which makes them advantageous over the local models , such as the original nambu  jona - lasinio model . at high virtualities the quark propagator and",
    "the vertex functions of the quark coupled to external fields reduce down to the free quark propagator and to local , point - like couplings .",
    "this property allows us to straightforwardly reproduce the leading terms of the operator product expansion .",
    "for instance , the second weinberg sum rule is reproduced in the model @xcite , which has not been the case of the local approaches .",
    "in addition , the intrinsic nonlocalities , inherent to the model , generate unconventional power and exponential corrections which have the same character as found in @xcite and in the instanton model ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the nonlocal effective model was successively applied to the description of the data from the cleo collaboration on the pion transition form factor in the interval of the space - like momentum transfer squared up to 8 gev@xmath26 adt99pigg , ad02 .",
    "importantly , in that study at zero photon virtualities the chiral anomaly result were reproduced , while at high photon virtualities the factorization of short and long distances occurs at a scale of the order of 1  gev@xmath26 .",
    "this allowed for the extraction of the pion distribution amplitudes of leading and next - to - leading twists .",
    "there are several further advantages in using the nonlocal models compared to the local approaches .",
    "the non - local interactions regularize the theory in such a way that the anomalies are preserved @xcite . in other regularization methods in the local models @xcite the preservation of the anomalies",
    "can only be achieved if the ( finite ) anomalous part of the action is left unregularized , and only the non - anomalous ( infinite ) part is regularized .",
    "next , with non - local interactions",
    "the model is finite to all orders in the @xmath27 ( loop ) expansion . finally ,",
    "as shown in @xcite , stable solitons exist in a chiral quark model with non - local interactions without the extra constraint that forces the chiral fields to lie on the chiral circle .    in the present paper we further test the nonlocal quark model by carrying out an analysis of the momentum dependence of the current - current correlators .",
    "a transformation of the spectral functions measured by the aleph collaboration into the euclidean momentum space allows us for a precise an unambiguous comparison of the experimental data with the model calculations .",

    "the dmgly sum rule collects contributions from the whole range of @xmath39 , both soft and hard .",

    "the first weinberg sum rule ( [ wsri ] ) fixes the normalization of correlators and holds in all variants of the nambu  jona - lasinio models , local or nonlocal .",
    "in general , the coefficients of the taylor expansion of the correlators at low euclidean momenta are given by the low energy constants of the strong chiral lagrangian .",
