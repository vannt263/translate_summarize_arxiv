    "recently the fermilab minos experiment has reported new results on @xmath2 disappearance  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the values of the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 preferred by this anti - neutrino measurement are in tension , at the 90% confidence level , with the preferred region in the @xmath3 versus @xmath5 plane for the neutrino @xmath6 disappearance .",
    "a likely explanation of this tension is lack of statistics especially in the anti - neutrino channel where the number of observed events in the far detector is approximately 100 whereas for the neutrino channel the number of events in the far detector is of order 20 times larger .",
    "one could speculate that the tension between neutrino and anti - neutrino disappearance might be the first hint of cpt violation in the neutrino sector  @xcite .",
    "however , given that cpt conservation is such an important tenet of modern quantum field theory , it is important to explore other possibilities for new physics before giving up cpt conservation . since the minos experiment is performed not in vacuum but with more than 700 kilometers of earth matter between the source and the detector , there is the possibility of wolfenstein type matter effects  @xcite leading to _ apparent _ cpt violation .",
    "while matter effects are not relevant to @xmath6 disappearance in minos in the standard three - flavor framework , they may become important in scenarios with sterile neutrinos  @xcite , or if new non - standard interactions are contributing to the potential that the neutrinos experience when traveling through matter .",
    "the latter option will be explored in this paper .",
    "in addition , we will also consider non - standard interactions modifying the neutrino detection process in a cp non - conserving way .",
    "non - standard interactions ( nsi ) in the neutrino sector have been introduced first as an _ alternative _ to standard oscillations  @xcite , and later as a possible addition  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of such subdominant nsi effects in current and near - future accelerator neutrino experiments has been investigated by many authors  @xcite , and bounds on nsi have been derived from oscillation and non - oscillation data  @xcite . in the context of the latest minos results , nsi",
    "have been brought up in  @xcite , and a concrete model has been proposed in  @xcite .    in the following , we will first show analytically how nsi affect neutrino oscillations in the two flavor limit ( sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic ] ) , and then perform fits to the minos @xmath6 and @xmath2 data including different types of nsi ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fit ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : future ] , we will consider the potential of the t2k  @xcite and no@xmath1a  @xcite experiments to test the nsi interpretation of minos .",

    "at @xmath7 energies relevant to neutrino oscillation experiments , non - standard interactions can be introduced in the lagrangian as effective dimension 6 operators coupling neutrinos and charged fermions .",
    "we will first discuss new neutral current couplings of @xmath8 and @xmath0 neutrinos to normal matter , i.e.  electrons , up - quarks , and down - quarks .",
    "phenomenologically , such operators will result in non - standard matter effects , so that the hamiltonian governing neutrino propagation in the @xmath8@xmath0 sector will read @xmath9 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the leptonic mixing matrix with the mixing angle @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the neutrino energy , and @xmath13 is the matter potential depending on the electron number density @xmath14 along the neutrino trajectory . the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 give the relative strength of the non - standard interactions compared to standard model weak interactions .",
    "the superscript @xmath18 indicates that these parameters describe non - standard neutrino matter effects .",
    "@xmath16 can in general be complex , while @xmath15 and @xmath17 have to be real in order to preserve the hermiticity of the hamiltonian . in the following",
    ", we will set @xmath19 since terms proportional to the identity matrix do not affect the neutrino oscillation probability , implying that oscillation experiments are only sensitive to the combination @xmath20 .",
    "the disappearance probability for @xmath6 in matter of constant density is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the mixing angle and mass squared difference in matter .",
    "these matter oscillation parameters can be found by solving the following set of coupled equations , @xmath24 the phase @xmath25 is unobservable in oscillations and can be phased away .",
    "the solution is trivial to find and is given by @xmath26    { \\rm and } \\quad \\sin^2 2\\theta_n & = &      \\vert\\delta m^2_{32 } \\sin 2 \\theta_{23 } + 2\\epsilon^m_{\\mu\\tau}a\\vert^2/\\delta m^4_n \\ , .    \\label{eqn : ssqth}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the disappearance probability can be written as @xmath27 with @xmath23 given by eq .  .",
    "this expression agrees with that found in ref .",

    "reduces to the standard two flavor disappearance probability . in the small @xmath29 limit ,",
    "i.e.  when @xmath30 , @xmath31 so @xmath16 modifies the disappearance probability in this limit whereas @xmath17 does not .    for anti - neutrinos , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , so that in matter @xmath34 without cpt violation .",
    "we note three interesting symmetries in eq .  :",
    "first , the expression depends only on @xmath35 $ ] , not on @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "therefore , it is invariant under the replacement @xmath37 for arbitrary integer @xmath38 .",

    "since @xmath48 is energy - dependent , this symmetry will not be manifest in the minos data , which covers a broad range of energies , and we will therefore not consider it further in this paper .    note that these symmetries are exact only in the two - flavor framework . in the three - flavor case with large @xmath49 , it is for example possible to determine the mass hierarchy by observing _ standard _",

    "if the wilson coefficients of the corresponding effective operators are complex , the interference term between the standard and non - standard feynman amplitudes can be different for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos and cp - violating phenomena can emerge .",
    "the modifications to the far detector event spectra observed in minos can be induced by ( i ) operators leading to a modified flux of @xmath6 at the far detector , but not at the near detector , and ( ii ) by operators leading to the production of muons in interactions of @xmath56 .",
    "( we neglect the possibility of non - standard interactions of @xmath57 since their flux at the far detector is between one and two order of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath6 because of the low @xmath57 contamination of the numi beam and the smallness of the mixing angle @xmath49 . )",
    "the only way of realizing case ( i ) in a three - flavor framework is to postulate a @xmath56 contamination in the numi beam , which would be invisible to the near detector , but would have partly oscillated into @xmath6 when reaching the far detector .",
    "however , results from the nomad experiment  @xcite constrain the @xmath56 contamination of a numi - like neutrino beam at short baseline to be less than @xmath58 at 90% confidence level , much too small to be relevant to minos .",
    "we therefore neglect case ( i ) in the following , and focus on case ( ii ) , a non - standard interaction of the type @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a nucleon and @xmath61 stands for the hadronic interaction products .",
    "the operator generating this process has the structure @xmath62 \\ , [ \\bar{\\mu } \\gamma_\\rho p_l \\nu_\\tau ] + h.c.\\ , ,    \\label{eq : l - nsi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote the up- and down - quark fields , @xmath65 is the fermi constant , @xmath66 and @xmath67 gives the strength of the non - standard interaction compared to standard model weak interactions .",

    "we will therefore neglect axial - vector nsi .",
    "we will also not consider scalar , pseudo - scalar , and tensor operators , since they could lead to the required interference between standard- and non - standard feynman amplitudes only if the outgoing muon in the detector undergoes a helicity flip  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath7 muons , this would correspond to a suppression of the non - standard interaction rate by @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath67 is non - zero , the counting rate in minos is no longer proportional to the standard survival probability @xmath72 , but rather to an _ apparent _ @xmath6 survival probability @xmath73 , defined by the number of muons produced in the detector in interactions of neutrinos with a given energy @xmath12 , divided by the number of muons that would be produced in the absence of neutrino oscillations and non - standard interactions .",
    "thus , @xmath74 includes the possibility that the neutrino flavor has changed into @xmath56 during propagation , but non - standard interactions still lead to a final state muon , normally associated with @xmath6 interactions . since the amplitudes for the processes @xmath75 and @xmath76 can interfere , @xmath74 can be larger than unity and is therefore not a survival probability in the usual sense .    in the two - flavor approximation we find for @xmath74  @xcite : @xmath77          - |\\epsilon^d_{\\tau\\mu}|^2 \\bigg ] \\sin^2 2\\theta_{23 }",

    "have the same energy dependence as the standard oscillation term and can therefore change only the depth of the oscillation dip , but not its position .",
    "they can thus only change the apparent value of @xmath5 that would be reconstructed in a standard oscillation analysis neglecting nsi .",
    "moreover , these terms do not depend on the sign of @xmath78 and can therefore not introduce an asymmetry between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos . the interference term between standard and non - standard amplitudes in the second line of eq .",

    "this requirement imposes two constraints on the three parameters @xmath80 , @xmath78 , and @xmath11 , so that there will be an infinite set of solutions .",

    "we have first checked that we were able to reproduce the results of the two - flavor standard oscillation fits performed by the minos collaboration .",

    "@xcite , this means that the probability for the apparent inconsistency between the @xmath6 and @xmath2 data sets to be merely a statistical fluctuation is about 6% . even though this probability is still relatively large ,",
    "let us now study how the fit improves if the possibility of non - standard interactions are included .",
    "we begin by assuming only neutral current nsi ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic - nc ] ) . using a three - flavor fit including the nsi parameters @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath17 , we find the following parameter values for the best fit point : @xmath93 the @xmath94 at the best fit point is 12.6 , and the number of degrees of freedom is 14 .",
    "note that the best fit value for @xmath16 is essentially real and negative .",
    "an equally good fit is obtained when the sign of @xmath45 is inverted ( eq .  ) , when the signs of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath43 are flipped simultaneously ( eq .  ) , or when the sign of @xmath17 and the octant of @xmath11 are changed ( eq .  ) .",

    "@xcite have directly fitted the oscillation probability to the ratio of observed to expected event numbers , as computed by the minos collaboration .",
    "a fit at the level of the oscillation probability , however , can not fully include experimental energy resolution effects .",
