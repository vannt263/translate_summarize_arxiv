    "the possibility of inducing synthetic electromagnetism in ultra - cold gases has attracted recently a large deal of attention . in spite of the electric charge neutrality of an atom , synthetic magnetic field",

    "note , however , that the soc introduces frustration , invalidating quantum monte carlo  ( mc ) approaches , and hence most studies have relied on classical mc calculations .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the effects of soc in a two - component fermi gas loaded in an optical lattice in the mott - insulator regime .",
    "since we are interested in the quantum spin-@xmath0 phases in the presence of soc , we can not rely on classical mc , and must hence employ exact diagonalization or density - matrix renormalization group  ( dmrg ) techniques .",
    "we employ the latter in our paper , restricting our analysis to the minimal system where the non - abelian character of the vector potential may be manifested allowing non - trivial effects of soc without the need of breaking the time - reversal invariance , namely a two - leg ladder - like optical lattice , which may be created by incoherently combining a 1d lattice and a two - well potential . by a combination of numerical dmrg results , bosonization techniques and strong rung - coupling expansions ,",

    "our numerical results reveal as well the appearance of striped phases with long range order where spins are ferromagnetically ordered in one direction and antiferromagnetically in the other .",

    "our numerical simulations suggest that similarly to the usoc case all phase transitions for the case of the non - abelian vector potential are of second - order ising nature .",
    "this is natural , since the system does not enjoy in general any continuous symmetry , and striped phases break spontaneously discrete @xmath180 symmetries : st@xmath157 breaks translation symmetry along the chains direction whereas st@xmath160 breaks the parity symmetry associated with the exchange of ladder legs . both striped phases break as well time reversal symmetry .",
    "the rs and @xmath166 phases present different parity symmetry for an odd number of rungs , whereas the rs phase is antisymmetric the @xmath166 is symmetric ; as a result both phases can not connect adiabatically .",

    "we have shown that for an usoc along the ladder rungs an nel state phase is located within a rs - f phase , in which a rung - singlet may be adiabatically connected to a ferromagnetic phase in the parameter space of @xmath12 and the soc . in contrast , for the usoc along the ladder legs the rs and f states can not be adiabatically connected , and are separated by an intermediate nel state , which disappears at a maximal soc to lead to a direct gaussian rs - f quantum phase transition .",
    "the case of a rashba - like soc is characterized by the appearance of rung - singlet and striped phases .",
    "compared to the classical spin phases predicted for fermions on a square lattice with soc  @xcite only the striped configurations of the 2d lattice have identical quantum counterparts on the ladder . on the contrary",
