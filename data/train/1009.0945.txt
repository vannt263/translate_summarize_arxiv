    "following @xcite we have numerically calculated the evolution of the perturbations by modifying the cmbfast code @xcite according to these equations .",
    "note that similar physics was also explored by @xcite .",
    "we solve the complete set of equations to obtain the power spectrum at different redshifts which can be used as initial conditions for our simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : ics ] shows the ratio between this initial condition to the two alternative models tested in this paper .",
    "in many cosmological ics for n - body simulations and semi - analytical calculations , the fluctuations of the baryons are assumed to be equal to the fluctuations of the dark matter .",
    "we construct a model that includes this incorrect assumption while maintaining the correct overall @xmath40 ( i.e. , conserving @xmath3 at @xmath41 , see appendix [ sig8 ] for more details ) .",
    "thus , in our `` e-@xmath2 '' model we calculate the correct @xmath40 as a combination of @xmath21 and @xmath22 from the fiducial calculation in section ( [ correct ] ) , but then take the baryon perturbation to be the same as for the dark matter , namely : @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the resulting linear over - density from the fiducial calculation ( e-@xmath2 model ) for the baryons and dark matter , respectively .",
    "we then compare the equal @xmath2 model to our fiducial calculation .",
    "figure [ fig : ics ] shows the ratio between the fid ics and the e-@xmath2 model for both the baryons and dark matter .",
    "we find that the e-@xmath2 model overestimates the baryon fluctuations by @xmath45 on large scales ( @xmath46  kpc ) while the overestimate grows to a much larger factor on small scales . before recombination the baryons",
    "were tightly coupled to the radiation , resulting in suppression of the growth of their overdensity .",
    "however , the dark matter component , which is not affected by the photons , could basically grow once the fluctuation wavelength entered the hubble horizon ( in the linear regime , before equality , the dark mater fluctuations grew logarithmically with the scale factor , where after equality they grew linearly with the scale factor ) .",
    "therefore , this resulted in a suppression of the baryonic overdensity by about three orders of magnitude compare to the dark matter at recombination ( e.g. , fig .  1 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while the baryons subsequently fall into the potential wells of the dark matter , it takes them some time to catch up , and the baryon fluctuations are still suppressed even at lower redshifts .",
    "this point is often overlooked in simulations and analytical calculations .",
    "@xcite showed that the presence of spatial fluctuations in the sound speed modifies the calculation of perturbation growth significantly . nevertheless , for completeness and as a case of comparison with previous results , we compare the simulation results with the results obtained using this approximation .",
    "thus , we proceed by presenting the basic equations of the growth of density fluctuations , in this approximation of a uniform sound speed ( hereafter `` mean @xmath4 '' ) . the evolution of the density fluctuations is described by a different set of coupled second order differential equations : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is assumed to be spatially uniform ( i.e. , independent of @xmath31 ) and is thus calculated from the thermal evolution of a uniform gas undergoing hubble expansion . with this assumption ,",
    "the temperature fluctuations ( as a function of @xmath31 ) are simply proportional at any given time to the gas density fluctuations : @xmath49 @xcite showed that this approximation leads to an underestimation of the baryon density fluctuations by up to 30% at @xmath50 and 10% at @xmath51 for large wavenumbers .",
    "figure  [ fig : ics ] shows the ratio between the mean @xmath4 initial conditions and the fiducial ones for both the baryons and dark matter .",
    "it agrees with our previous results , showing that the underestimate by the mean @xmath4 model is greatest at @xmath52  kpc .",
    "the non - linear evolution resulting from these initial conditions will result in shallower potential wells compared to the fiducial calculation , even though it is clear that the precise baryon temperature fluctuations at high redshift are very significant , still many simulations use initial conditions that assume a uniform speed of sound in the universe .",
    "as shown below this leads to significantly different estimates for the gas content of the early halos .",
    "we run a gadget 2 simulation @xcite starting from redshift @xmath53 , for a total of @xmath54 particles ( @xmath55 particles each for the dark matter and baryon components ) and our box size is : @xmath56  mpc . we choose this box size so that a halo mass of @xmath57  m@xmath58 would have @xmath59 particles . this way according to @xcite we are able to estimate the gas fraction in @xmath60  m@xmath58 halos correctly ( see below for the halo definition ) .",
    "our softening length is 0.2 comoving kpc .    for all runs ,",
    "glass - like cosmological ics were generated using the zeldovich approximation .",
    "the transfer functions were generated using the various models described above .",
    "we have used a glass file which was randomly displaced thus removing the coupling between nearby dm and gas particles . using this randomization procedure",
    "we achieve essentially the same effect to that shown in @xcite . in generating the ics ,",
    "a convolution between the glass file and the transfer function from the different models was done , thus taking into account the different velocities of the dm and baryons ( for the fiducial and mean cs models ) .",
    "we note that we have used the same phases for the dm and baryons , in all of the simulations .",
    "we set the initial temperature to be @xmath61  k ( as derived from linear theory ) , and thus gadget assumes neutral and monoatomic gas , and converts to thermal energy ( i.e. , adiabatic initial conditions ) .",
    "although this work emphasizes the need for a precise calculation of the baryon overdensities resulting from temperature fluctuations , we actually neglect the temperature fluctuations in the initial conditions .",
    "this may not be a bad approximation since the halos we study are already somewhat non - linear at our initial redshift , and the compton heating is quite small compared to the adiabatic heating during non - linear gravitational collapse ( see appendix [ cheating ] )",
    ". a more complete treatment would be to include in the simulation the precise temperature fluctuations , which we leave for future work .",
    "nevertheless , even with the current treatment our results show consistency with linear theory .",
    "we locate dark matter halos by running a fof group - finder algorithm with a linking parameter of @xmath62 .",
    "we then find the center of mass of each halo and calculate the density profile of the dark matter and baryons , separately . in order to derive the density profile we assume a spherical halo , and divide it to 2000 shells .",
    "combining these density profiles , we find the virial radius @xmath63 at which the overdensity is @xmath64 times the background density , and the gas fraction of each halo .",
    "recently , @xcite performed a resolution analysis in order to study the mass definition of halos in simulations .",
    "their conclusion ( their figure 2 ) is that using the fof algorithm and assuming about 500 particles per spherical halo introduces an error of @xmath65 in the mass definition . in our gas fraction analysis we have chosen only halos with a number of particles larger or equal to @xmath66 , i.e. , we limit our errors in halo mass definition to below @xmath67 . also , according to @xcite , this way we can estimate the gas fraction inside a halo accurately .",
    "one way to probe cosmic structure particularly on small scales is through the non - linear power spectrum .",

    "the main disagreement between the three models lies in the baryonic component ( although the e-@xmath2 calculation also underestimates the dark matter overdensities by @xmath68 ) .",

    "the simplest assumption , often used in the literature , is that a dark matter halo has the mean cosmic fraction .",
    "this can lead to incorrect results , especially when one tries to study star formation , galaxy mergers , and related phenomena .",
    "consider the various scales involved in the formation of non - linear objects containing dm and gas . on large scales ( small wavenumbers )",
    "gravity dominates halo formation and gas pressure can be neglected . on small scales , on the other hand",
    ", the pressure dominates gravity and prevents baryon density fluctuations from growing together with the dark matter fluctuations .",
    "the relative force balance at a given time can be characterized by the @xcite scale , which is the minimum scale on which a small gas perturbation will grow due to gravity overcoming the pressure gradient .",
    "as long as the compton scattering of the cmb on the residual free electrons after cosmic recombination kept the gas temperature coupled to that of the cmb , the jeans mass was constant in time . however , at @xmath73 the gas temperature decoupled from the cmb temperature and the jeans mass began to decrease with time as the gas cooled adiabatically .",
    "any overdensity on a scale more massive than the jeans mass at a given time can begin to collapse , due to a lack of sufficient pressure .",
    "however , the jeans mass is related only to the evolution of perturbations at a given time . when the jeans mass itself varies with time , the overall suppression of the growth of perturbations depends on a time - averaged jeans mass .",
    "@xcite defined a `` filtering mass '' that describes the highest mass scale on which the baryonic pressure still manages to suppress the linear baryonic fluctuations significantly .",
    "@xcite suggested , based on a simulation , that the filtering mass also describes the largest halo mass whose gas content is significantly suppressed compared to the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "the latter mass scale , in general termed the `` characteristic mass '' , is defined as the halo mass for which the enclosed baryon fraction equals half the mean cosmic fraction .",

    "@xcite included the fact that the baryons have smoother ics than the dark matter ( see * ? ? ? * ) and found a lower value of the filtering mass ( by a factor of @xmath74 , depending on the redshift ) .",
    "following @xcite , the filtering scale ( specifically , the filtering wavenumber @xmath75 ) is defined by expanding the ratio of baryonic to total density fluctuations to first order in @xmath76 : @xmath77 where @xmath31 is the wavenumber , and @xmath21 and @xmath78 are the baryonic and total ( i.e. , including both baryons and dark matter ) density fluctuations , respectively .",

    "the ratio @xmath79 is independent of @xmath31 , and its magnitude decreases with time approximately @xmath82 , since @xmath83 is roughly constant and @xmath78 is dominated by the growing mode @xmath84 ( see figure 1 top panel in * ? ? ?",
    "the filtering mass is defined from @xmath75 simply as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the mean matter density today .",

    "since the simulation is limited in box size , all of the perturbations on large scales are effectively frozen in the simulation .",
    "therefore , we do not extract @xmath79 directly from the simulations , but instead calculate it based on the initial conditions as @xmath87 , where the subscript `` in '' refers to initial .",

    "the filtering mass represents the competition between gravity and pressure , as it measures the largest scale at which pressure has had a significant overall effect on halo formation .",
    "since it measures an integrated effect over the formation , this mass scale is also very sensitive to the evolution history and the initial conditions ( as shown in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the mean @xmath4 model ,",
    "the temperature fluctuations are greatly overestimated on all relevant scales ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in reality the coupling to the cmb ( in the fid model ) keeps the temperature fluctuations highly suppressed for some time after recombination .",
    "moreover , as mentioned in section [ sec : basic ] ( and see also appendix [ cheating ] ) , we do not include explicitly the effect of initial temperature fluctuations in the simulations .",

    "the initially enhanced filtering mass ( compared to the fid model ) helps maintain a higher filtering mass even at moderately low redshift .    in the e-@xmath2 model ,",
    "the baryon perturbations start out much higher than in the other models , so one might expect that the final baryon fraction in halos would tend to be higher as well ; here , however , it is important to separate two issues .",
    "the high initial baryon perturbations in the e-@xmath2 model are present at all scales , so they affect even high - mass halos that are unaffected by pressure",
    ". this can explain why the simulation with the e-@xmath2 ics produced the highest baryon fraction in high - mass halos ( see the top panel of figure  [ fig : mc ] ) .",
    "however , when we consider the differences between large and small scales , the high baryon perturbations produce a large pressure term , increasing the effect of pressure relative to gravity and producing a higher filtering mass in the e-@xmath2 model than in the fid model . note",
    "that the filtering mass is particularly sensitive to the importance of pressure at the very highest redshifts ( above 100 ) , since at lower redshifts the gas cools and the jeans mass decreases , reducing the contribution of these redshifts to the final filtering mass .",
    "we note that in @xcite the calculation of the filtering mass in the fiducial model was compared to the time integrated filtering mass in a model that assumes the mean speed of sound model , neglects the @xmath79 factor , and starts out with initial conditions as in the e-@xmath2 model . here , we have separated our discussion into several different cases .",
    "there is no apriori reason to think that the filtering mass can also accurately describe properties of highly non - linear , virialized objects . for halos",

    "for clarity , we emphasize that this statement ( @xmath99 ) refers to our definition of @xmath100 in equation  ( [ mf ] ) .",
    "the characteristic mass is essentially a non - linear version of the filtering mass , and so it also measures the competition between gravity and pressure . at high masses , where pressure is unimportant , @xmath101 , while the low mass tail is determined by the suppression of gas accretion caused by high baryonic pressure .      ; different panels show @xmath89 , @xmath94 , and @xmath93 .",

    "the parameter @xmath94 shows a less clear pattern with redshift , but it is generally lowest for the fid model .",
    "overall , the most important implication is that the gas fraction in halos is highly sensitive to the assumed initial conditions .",
    "comparing to linear theory allows us to understand some of these results . as noted in section  [ sec : mf ] , we calculated the filtering mass from linear theory for each of the ics , and the linear calculation allows us to understand the relative importance of pressure in the various ic models , at least during the linear evolution .",
    "although the simulation results come from non - linear , viralized halos , we find an approximate agreement ( typically to within @xmath107 ) between the filtering mass , as defined here and in our previous work @xcite , and the characteristic mass as measured in the simulation , for all the models .",
    "in particular , the relative sizes of @xmath89 among the various models , and the slow decline of all the characteristic masses with time , are well matched by the corresponding @xmath100 values predicted from linear theory .",
    "this close match can be understood from the fact that while both gravity and pressure increase during the non - linear evolution , their relative strength only changes by a relatively small factor as a halo undergoes non - linear collapse and virialization .",
    "halos in which pressure had a large effect during the early , linear evolution stage , keep sufficient pressure to maintain the suppressed baryon content all through the final collapse . on the other hand , in more massive halos in which gravity overcame pressure early on , the baryons keep up with the collapse of the dark matter and the pressure never has a major role .    for the e-@xmath2 alternative model , we find that the resulting characteristic mass is higher than the result in the fid model .",
    "specifically , at @xmath51 we find @xmath108  m@xmath6 and @xmath109 ) .",
    "this can be understood since setting the gas fluctuations to be equal to the dark matter s means that the pressure of the gas is higher compared to the fid model .",
    "as can also be seen from comparison to linear theory , the system retains the memory of the pressure , due to the time integrated nature of the filtering mass .",
    "therefore , the higher pressure translates to a higher filtering / characteristic mass .",
    "the mean @xmath4 approximation starts with effectively smoother ics than in the fid model ( @xmath107 underestimate of the small - scale baryon overdensity ) .",
    "thus , the baryonic components lag behind the dark matter collapse , and the pressure is always overestimated for a given baryon overdensity ( due to the overestimated temperature fluctuations ) , resulting in a lower gas fraction for any given halo mass , i.e. , the characteristic mass is higher than in the fid model .",
    "specifically , at @xmath51 we find @xmath110  m@xmath6 and @xmath109 .",
    "this can be compared with @xmath111  m@xmath6 and @xmath112 for the fid ics .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite showed that the characteristic mass scale does not agree with the @xcite filtering mass in the low - redshift , post - reionization regime .",
    "however , it is important to note that at these low redshifts , the heating / cooling and other feedback mechanisms are complex and highly inhomogeneous , so that the `` filtering mass '' calculated from linear theory is not really precisely defined , and the comparison of the linear and non - linear results can not really be considered a direct and precise test . in contrast , @xcite found that the filtering mass gives a good approximation to the characteristic mass , even in the presence of a `` flash '' heating event ( see also * ? ? ? * ) that is physically somewhat contrived but allows for a clear comparison of the linear and non - linear results .",
    "summarizing our results , we find a good agreement between the characteristic mass and the filtering mass in all the models .",
    "figure [ fig : mc ] shows the best fitted parameters at various redshifts for @xmath89 and @xmath94 , and our value for @xmath93 , for all models ( the 1-@xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) confidence regions are listed in table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in this statement we are referring to our definition in equation  ( [ mf ] ) , which is one eighth of the original definition which @xcite claimed was a good fit to the characteristic mass .",
    "while we have been careful to select halos with at least 500 particles , based on the results of @xcite , we do not have the even higher mass resolution needed to perform a resolution convergence test as they did .",
    "our main conclusion is that at least in the redshift range @xmath1 the filtering mass provides a fairly good estimate for the characteristic mass .",
    "this extends the redshift range of the agreement between the filtering mass and the characteristic mass found in @xcite ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "another significant result from this agreement is that previous work ( either analytical , semi - analytical , or using simulations ) that used the filtering or characteristic mass without accounting for the correct initial conditions resulted in inaccurate results .",
    "this is due to the significant ( factor of 23 ) variation among the predictions of the filtering / characteristic mass in the various models .",
    "since this mass scale is of prime importance in early structure formation it is imperative to calculate it accurately .",
    "we have used three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the effect of different initial conditions on the gas fraction in halos in the early universe .",
    "specifically , we studied the minimum `` gas - rich '' mass defined to have half of the mean cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "we tested three different models for the initial conditions ( see text for more details )    1 .   `` fid '' ics ; this model is based on the linear evolution from @xcite , which allows the baryonic speed of sound to spatially vary as a result of the compton scattering with the cmb .",
    "`` e-@xmath2 '' ics ; in this model , the linear evolution from @xcite is modified to match a common assumption in the literature , where the linear initial overdensity of the baryons is taken to be equal to that of the dm , i.e. , @xmath116 , while conserving @xmath3 from the fid model .",
    "3 .   `` mean @xmath4 ics '' ; this model assumes that the baryonic speed of sound is spatially uniform .",
    "although @xcite showed that this assumption yields an inaccurate evolution of the baryon density and temperature perturbations , it is still often used in codes that generate initial conditions for simulations .",
    "for all of the tests we used a total of @xmath54 particles of dark matter and baryons with a box size of @xmath56  mpc , starting at @xmath23 .",
    "there are two major findings from the analysis we present here .",
    "the first , shown throughout the paper , is the importance of assuming the correct initial conditions , both for analytical calculations and numerical simulations .",
    "structure formation ( both in the linear and non - linear regime ) and halo gas fractions are very sensitive to the initial conditions even at relatively low redshifts ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the second major finding is the apparent agreement between the filtering mass and the characteristic mass ( to within @xmath107 ) .",
    "this suggests , as a broader implication , that one can use linear theory in order to predict the overall trend of highly non - linear behavior ( at least in the case of determining the gas fraction of halos ) .",
    "the the fiducial calculation , which was presented in @xcite , follows the time evolution of the linear overdensities correctly .",
    "however , the other ics produce different results for the baryonic structure formation .",
    "for instance , the non - linear power spectrum ( fig .  [ fig : nonlinear ] ) shows that the system still remembers its initial condition differences even at redshift 15 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath4 model underestimates the non - linear baryonic fluctuations by about @xmath118 while the e-@xmath2 model overestimates them by @xmath119 on small scales .    the mean @xmath4 approximation and the e-@xmath2 model are often used to set the initial conditions in simulations , e.g.",
    ", the cmbfast code @xcite assumes the mean @xmath4 approximation while @xcite is used with the e-@xmath2 assumption .",
    "we have shown that the non - linear evolution is very sensitive to the initial conditions ( figure  [ fig : nonlinear ] ) and they affect the gas fraction in small halos down to redshift @xmath117 ( figure  [ fig : mc ] ) .",
    "our results emphasize the importance of the differences between the dark matter and baryons and of the spatial sound speed fluctuations , in both the linear calculation and the initial conditions of the simulations .",
    "it is important to emphasize that although compton heating is not included in the gadget code that we used in this analysis ( gadget-2 ) , the fiducial calculation still describes fairly well the non - linear behavior .",
    "actually , the compton heating contribution to the heating of the gas in non - linear objects is negligible compare to the adiabatic heating due to the gravitational collapse ( see appendix [ cheating ] ) .",
    "also , as noted above , much of the contribution to the filtering mass comes from the highest redshifts , above our simulation starting redshift of 99 , since the jeans mass is highest then and so the pressure has the greatest impact at that early time .    in each simulation , we calculated the characteristic mass for which a halo keeps most of its baryons ( eq .  [ f_g - alpha ] ) .",
    "we found that the fid calculation gives the lowest value , which suggests that with these correct ics , pressure plays only a moderate role in galaxy formation .",
    "in particular , the characteristic mass of @xmath5  m@xmath6 is significantly below the minimum mass for molecular hydrogen cooling , so the gas content is not strongly suppressed even in the smallest star - forming halos . in other words",
    "we find that before significant heating took place the baryon fraction in halos is ( eq .  [ f_g - alpha ] with @xmath120  m@xmath58 and @xmath121 ) @xmath122^{-75/16 } \\ .\\ ] ] the other alternative models give incorrect higher value for the characteristic mass , closer to the minimum mass for forming stars . even with the fid ics , pressure does strongly limit the amount of gas in minihalos below the molecular hydrogen cooling mass .",
    "we note that this value of @xmath123  m@xmath6 assumes adiabatic evolution , in particular with no stellar heating .",
    "this value is consistent with the results of @xcite for a somewhat higher redshift range .",
    "we find that the theoretical linear filtering mass ( as defined in section  [ sec : mf ] ) is in fairly good agreement with the characteristic mass .",
    "this finding is true for all the models tested here , throughout a significant redshift range , so this may imply more generally a close relation between linear theory and non - linear halo formation .",
    "in addition , this is consistent with the findings by @xcite from amr simulations , where the filtering mass and the characteristic mass agreed in the `` e-@xmath2 '' model , even when a sudden heating was introduced .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our results are valid only in the pre - reionization era . at the end of the reionization",
    ", @xcite concluded that the characteristic mass is likely to be close to the atomic - cooling threshold of @xmath124 , which is also close to the values found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite argued that the initial velocity difference between the baryons and dark matter after recombination has not been fully accounted for , because of a higher - order contribution that is not included in the linear theory approach .",
    "they estimated this higher - order effect within the mean @xmath4 approximation and found that it causes an additional suppression of the small - scale power spectrum , in turn affecting the formation of the first structures .",
    "this effect should be further investigated as in our detailed approach here , although this would be more difficult ( analytically , it is a higher - order and anisotropic term , and to simulate it directly would require starting at quite high redshifts ) .",

    "below we show that for non - linear objects the heating is actually negligible compared to the adiabatic heating due to the gravitational collapse of baryons into the dark matter potential wells .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to include compton heating in the linear stage only .",
    "the heating of the gas @xmath216 due to compton heating from the cmb @xcite during the free - fall time @xmath217 of gravitational collapse is @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath39 is the photon energy density , @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the cmb and gas temperature and @xmath35 is the electron fraction out of the total number density of gas particles at time @xmath36 .",
    "the virial theorem gives a relation in collapsed objects between the thermal energy @xmath222 and the gravitational energy @xmath223 , i.e. , @xmath224 .",
    "thus , for a halo mass @xmath91 with virial radius @xmath63 the thermal energy can be expressed as : @xmath225 for all relevant redshifts and mass scales we find that @xmath226 .",
    "therefore , neglecting the contribution of the compton heating during the non - linear evolution is justified . however , as we have shown , neglecting the compton heating in the linear evolution and in the initial conditions leads to inaccurate values for the gas fraction in halos ."
