    "pointing , which varied by @xmath32 - 3 \" , was checked at every calibration observation performed at least once per hour .",

    "these observations , assuming flux densities from sandell ( 1994 ) for l1551-irs5 and from the planetary flux density model of wright ( 1976 ) , were then applied _ directly _ to the photometric observations of gg tau without having to estimate atmospheric opacity or instrumental sensitivity .",
    "( the differences in airmass between mars and gg tau would only introduce an error of @xmath13% even assuming @xmath5 1 . )",
    "consistent values of flux density were found from both calibrators , and quoted errors reflect both the statistical and calibration uncertainties .    during the run of december 1994 , we obtained the zenith optical depth at 225 ghz from the cso radiometer and found the sky to be stable over the course of the observations .",
    "two observations of mars at airmasses of 1.5 and 1.1 allowed us to estimate the atmospheric optical depth at the observed wavelengths over the relevant airmass .",
    "we also had observations of l1551 irs 5 at virtually the same airmass as gg tau .",
    "we used these two calibration methods ( i.e. deriving @xmath4 and sensitivity from mars , and direct comparison with l1551-irs5 ) to derive consistent values of flux density for gg tau .",
    "the data from bscg were obtained at the institut de radio astronomie millimtrique ( iram ) 30 m telescope at pico veleta in april 1988 , and were calibrated for flux density using mars and uranus .",
    "the effective wavelength of the observations was 1300@xmath0 .",

    "( note that these errors do not include the uncertainty of the absolute flux of mars ( about 5% ) based on the model of wright ( 1976 ) . )",
    "it is apparent that from september 1991 to january 1994 the flux density of gg tau has increased by more than 50% at 800@xmath0 and by @xmath640% at 1100@xmath0 , but by only @xmath117% at 1300@xmath0 . from january to september 1994 , there was a marginal decrease at 800@xmath0 , and a decrease to 1991 values at 1100 and 1300 @xmath0 .",
    "it thus appears that the circumbinary disk of gg tau experienced a significant increase in its measured luminosity , a `` flare '' , between late 1991 and late 1993 , affecting predominantly sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "one must use caution , however , before accepting such a claim .",
    "errors in calibration , etc . , could account for apparent changes in measured flux density . as noted in  2 , all of these data except for the run of january 1994 and of december 1989 ( from bs ) were calibrated for flux density from mars , and by using the assumed martian flux densities calculated from the model of wright ( 1976 ) .",
    "the december 1989 observation at 1100@xmath0 was calibrated from several sources .",
    "the january 1994 run was calibrated on crl618 , whose flux density was checked on mars during the september 1994 run .",
    "thus , with minor exceptions , all of the calibration has been done in a consistent manner , and we are confident that the derived flux densities are correct within errors .",

    "is well within one standard deviation of being unity .",
    "only gg tau has an elevated flux density .",
    "finally we note that the 800@xmath0 and 1100@xmath0 flux densities measured by bs and bscg in 1989/1990 on different telescopes using different instruments are consistent with our 1991 observations and inconsistent with those of post-1991 .",
    "the ratio of our september 1994 800@xmath0 data to the average bs 1989 data is 1.37@xmath20.11 , and the corresponding 1100@xmath0 data is 1.34@xmath20.12 .",
    "other effects could potentially mimic a change in flux density .",
    "if the source is extended , a smaller aperture or beamwidth would detect less of the emission .",
    "however , interferometric observations , including those of dutrey , guilloteau & simon ( 1994 ) , have resolved the structure of gg tau , and have found it to be @xmath73 \" , i.e. much smaller than any of the beamwidths used .",
    "the component to the south associated with gg tau(c ) ( the smaller of the two binary systems ) is not visible at 2.7 mm in the dutrey et al maps , indicating that there is little contribution to the millimeter emission from that source .",
    "in addition , the jcmt beam used by mswkt is identical to ours , and would cover the same area .",
    "finally , it must be noted that the observations of bs are made at slightly _",
    "shorter _ wavelengths ( 769@xmath0 compared to 790@xmath0 , and 1056@xmath0 compared to 1090@xmath0 ) .",
    "since flux density goes as @xmath8 , however , the effect of this should be to _ increase _ the flux density seen by bs , which is opposite to the effect seen .",
    "figure [ ggtau_fig2 ] displays the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of gg tau using the pre-1992 data from table 1 , the 1994 january and december data , and the iras flux densities .",
    "mswkt have shown that the slope of the sed at millimeter / sub - millimeter wavelengths is steeper for embedded sources compared to more evolved , optically visible , t tauri stars ( like gg tau ) .",
    "indeed gg tau had the shallowest sed of all the sources in their study . from figure [ ggtau_fig2 ]",
    "it can be seen that the slope of the sed appears to have changed as gg tau has undergone the `` flare '' . in table 4",
    "we show the slope @xmath9 of the sed ( from @xmath8 ) derived from each data set ( bs includes a 624@xmath0 data point plus the data from bscg ) .",
    "the sed appears to have steepened abruptly after the `` flare '' , and continues to be steeper than pre-``flare '' .",
    "any model ought to account for a number of effects , including an increase of the 800 @xmath0 flux density of at least 50% over a timescale of @xmath72 years , with relatively little effect at longer wavelengths , resulting in a steepening of the sed during the flare and a more rapid return at longer wavelengths to `` normal '' .",
    "let us consider the existing disk models for gg tau s continuum emission . in 1990 , beckwith et al presented a source model for gg tau that consisted of a geometrically thin disk , with a large optically thick regime ( out to 45 au ) and an overall disk size of 100 au .",
    "their model accounts for the fluxes from 12 to 1300 @xmath0 quite well ( fig .",
    "[ ggtau_fig3 ] , solid line ) . however , dutrey et al ( 1994 ) reported that the disk had a large central 180 au radius `` hole '' , based on 2.6 mm interferometer observations .",
    "they presented an alternate model , where a cold dust ring at approximately 180 au was the dominant emission source of the 2.6 mm emission .",
    "beyond the ring , which contained some 90% of the disk mass , the disk continued with a very flat surface density law .",
    "in addition , they replaced the optically thin disk with a flared disk , whose scale height was roughly 30 au at 180 au radius .",
    "they argued that the temperature profile was likely to be t@xmath10r@xmath11 , because the flared disk would intercept a larger fraction of the stellar luminosity than spatially thin disk models .",
    "it effectively would act more like an envelope than a disk when intercepting the stellar radiation field .",
    "artymowicz and lubow ( 1995 ) showed how such a circumbinary disk might arise and actually be dynamically important for the evolution of the central binary .",
    "we point out that if the dutrey et al .",
    "idea of a dense dust ring is correct , the temperature profile is likely to be steeper in the dust ring ( and the outer disk colder ) than their model assumes .",
    "this occurs because the dust ring , which has a large extinction , attenuates the radiation field of the central stars quite strongly ( wolfire and churchwell 1994 ) . while the inner temperature would likely remain at 25 k",
    ", the temperature of the outer disk would fall below the 20 k that is assumed in the dutrey et al .",
    "model . the outer disk , thus , could be effectively shielded from the central heating source .",
    "in addition , their model does not produce any substantial flux below 100@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ ggtau_fig3 ] , dashed line ) , implying that at least one additional component ( either a smaller circumbinary disk or circumstellar disk ) must be present to explain the iras data . as an illustration of the type of disk that might be present , we present in fig .",
    "[ ggtau_fig3 ] ( dotted line ) a disk model which is simply a truncated beckwith et al . model .",
    "this optically thick ( at 50 @xmath0 ) disk has a mass of less than 10@xmath12 m@xmath13 . with an outer radius of only 15 au",
    ", it lies well inside the estimated deprojected separation of 50 au reported by dutrey et al .",
    "roddier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) detected a near - infrared excess toward both stars in the cavity region , likely due to circumstellar disks .",
    "also , the h@xmath9 emission from gg tau which led to its classification as a t tauri star is believed to be indirect evidence of a circumstellar disk , as opposed to the circumbinary disk seen at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "given the current large uncertainties of the disk(s ) physical properties , we feel that it is unrealistic to construct a detailed model at this time .",
    "therefore , we will investigate flat disk models . for these",
    ", we adopt a single temperature power law for the disk , and the radii indicated by dutrey et al .",
    ", as appropriate for the submillimeter region .",
    "we adopt the procedures as described in butner , natta , & evans ( 1994 ) to parameterize the disk properties .",
    "we varied the density , density profiles , temperature radial profiles , and dust optical properties to get a sense of how sensitive the predicted spectral energy distributions are to the input parameters .",
    "we found the current spectral energy distribution could be fit by models within a broad range of parameter space . in fig .",
    "[ ggtau_fig4 ] , we present three such models , where the `` before '' and `` after '' models are indicated by solid and dashed lines respectively . in each case , we limit ourselves to changing a single input parameter . in fig",
    "[ ggtau_fig4](a ) , our model is based on a power law with a temperature profile given by t(r)@xmath10 r@xmath14 ; @xmath15 . the only change between the models is the disk s luminosity , or effectively the disk temperature at the inner radius . the second model ( fig .",
    "[ ggtau_fig4](b ) ) has @xmath16 , and again , the only change between models is an increase in the disk luminosity .",
    "both fit the pre - brightening phase reasonably well . by adjusting a single parameter , the total disk luminosity ( or equivalently the temperature at the disk inner edge )",
    ", we can then produce the post - brightening observations .",
    "the change in the disk luminosity is modest , going from @xmath170.01 to @xmath170.02 l@xmath18 in both cases .",
    "the corresponding disk temperatures changes are modest , only a few degrees with the disks remaining very cold ( 10 - 20 k ) .",
    "an alternative to varying the temperature and large - scale disk properties is to hold these constant , and instead vary the dust properties . in fig .",
    "[ ggtau_fig4](c ) , we present `` pre- '' and `` post- '' brightening models where the dust opacity law ( parameterized as @xmath19 ) steepens from @xmath20 0.2 to @xmath20 1.0 .",
    "we note that our @xmath20 0.2 model , while extremely high , is in agreement with the estimate of @xmath21 in beckwith and sargent s optically thin disks ( their @xmath22 models ) .",
    "it is possible to produce the brightening effect in other ways of course , such as varying the inner radius of the dust ring .",
    "the size scales involved ( the nominal model disk mass is a substantial fraction of 1 m@xmath18 and the radius is order 200 au ) , however , would argue for longer timescales than we see for this event .",
    "we emphasize that the fits in fig .",
    "[ ggtau_fig4 ] are simple `` toy '' models intended as a starting point for detailed calculations , not as a claim justifying a particular mechanism .",
    "our `` toy '' models illustrate that the observations do not define the parameters sufficiently to identify physical causes for the observed brightening .",
    "the effect is dramatic enough , however , that it is interesting to speculate .",
    "what would cause a sudden increase in luminosity ( or temperature across the entire disk ) and/or a change in the dust properties of a circumstellar disk ?",
    "various possibilities suggest themselves .",
    "for example , an inner disk might still be accreting material ( artymowicz and lubow , 1995 ) .",
    "if this disk were to undergo an outburst , it might have increased the energy available for the outer circumbinary disk to intercept . to date , no convincing reports of such dramatic changes have been reported at visual wavelengths for gg tau ( herbst , herbst & grossman 1994 ) .",
    "a standard fu - ori - type outburst with its 100 times increase in luminosity certainly has not been seen .",
    "another possibility is some sort of event in the circumbinary disk itself .",
    "one case that appeals to dynamical events is a change in the disk scale height .",
    "the change in scale height would permit the disk to intercept more radiation , thus allowing a natural way to increase the disk s luminosity .",
    "the distances involved  a 10 or 15 au change in scale height is required to account for a two - fold increase in total disk luminosity  are large enough to be a concern .",
    "the required velocities are more than 20 km / sec , and it is difficult to imagine what type of event would cause parts of the disk to achieve such large - scale motions . altering the grain properties would require a sudden density enhancement for that mechanism to be viable .",
    "a sudden accretion event in the disk , or interaction with gg tau / c , the binary system which lies a few arcseconds to the south ( cf dutrey et al 1994 ) , might provide the trigger .",
    "co(2 - 1 ) data presented by koerner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) illustrates that the gas motions in the area may be more complex than the co(1 - 0 ) indicates , and the near - ir images of roddier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show bridge - like structures between the outer ring and inner stars .",
    "if there had been an accretion shock as material fell on the disk , there might be additional energy ",
    "either for heating the grains or altering their structure enough to affect the optical properties .    finally , we note that one other t tauri star , v773 tauri ( hd 283447 ) , is known to be variable at mm - wavelengths ( dutrey et al .",
    "1996 ; jensen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ; bscg ; osterloh & beckwith 1995 ) .",
    "it is also bright at cm - wavelenghts ( oneal et al .",
    "1990 ; feigelson et al . 1994 ) and is rapidly and strongly variable at these wavelengths .",
    "its variability and large brightness temperature ( phillips , lonsdale & feigelson 1991 ) suggest that the emission is synchrotron radiation related to a strong magnetic field .",
    "it is conceivable that the sub - millimeter variability of gg tau may also be related to non - thermal processes .",
    "however , unlike v773 tau , gg tau s variability seems greatest at short wavelengths , and indeed gg tau has not been detected at centimeter - wavelengths despite at least two sensitive surveys ( bieging , cohen & schwartz 1984 ; white , jackson & kundu 1993 ) .",
    "thus it seems most likely that the outburst from gg tau is thermal in nature and likely related to the circumstellar disk and/or circumbinary ring .      while at drao",
