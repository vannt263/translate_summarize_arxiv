    "uncovering the structure of the qcd phase diagram is one of the major goals in studying relativistic heavy - ion collisions",

    "would be suppressed in experiment . instead",
    ", the phenomena of oscillatory behaviors , such as the non - monotonic and sign change , are the particularly interesting signals which could be directly measured in experiments  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it has been found that the sixth order to the second order cumulant ratio ( @xmath0 ) undergo a significant sign change near the qcd phase transition  @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 is a promising observable and it can be measured from rhic to up to lhc energies  @xcite . unfortunately , comparing to the other lower order cumulant measurements , the price of measuring @xmath0 in an experiment is the larger number of required events and the stronger effects of non - critical background contributions .    currently , there are many discussions on the effects of the non - critical background contributions for cumulants . due to the global conservation , the cumulants of the conserved quantities",
    "are substantially suppressed  @xcite .",
    "the effects of the acceptance cuts as well as efficiency corrections drastically influence the measured cumulants  @xcite .",
    "the initial size fluctuation is also one of the important non - critical effects which exists in all experiment event variables  @xcite .",
    "what we want to emphasize here is that the techniques to reduce those non - critical effects should be studied carefully case by case for different cumulants . with the star detector at rhic , to suppress the effects of auto - correlation in the measurement , the centrality for the measurement of cumulants of the net - proton multiplicity distributions is determined by number of charged kaons and pions produced in the final state within @xmath1  @xcite , while it is defined by final state multiplicity within @xmath2 for the measurement of cumulants of the net - charge multiplicity distributions  @xcite .",
    "due to the detector setup of phenix at rhic , there is no issue of auto - correlation for the measurement of cumulants of the net - charge multiplicity distributions  @xcite . for @xmath0",
    ", the effects of the auto - correlation and centrality resolution should be different at lhc and rhic  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on discussing the measurement of @xmath0 with the star detector at rhic with bes i data .",
    "the centrality bin width correction ( cbwc ) method is applied to reduce initial size fluctuation on the measurement of the cumulants in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "there are two key points when applying the cbwc method : one is that the statistics in the selected centrality bin width should be sufficient to satisfy the central limit theorem ( clt )  @xcite and the other one is that the selected centrality bin width should optimally reduce the initial size fluctuation . with sufficient statistics",
    ", it has been found that the values of @xmath3 are consistent based on the cbwc methods in each @xmath4 centrality bin width and in each of @xmath5  @xcite . since the chosen centrality bin width can vary , the number of events that are required by the clt should be dependent on the chosen centrality bin width used by cbwc method .",
    "for example , within transverse momentum range @xmath6 gev/@xmath7 , the required statistics for @xmath3 of net - proton number is 15 million ( 15 m ) based on cbwc method in each of @xmath5 , while 1 m is enough if cbwc method is applied for each centrality bin with a width of @xmath4  @xcite . for @xmath0 , the resolution with different centrality bin widths used by cbwc method and",

    "even with the anticipated statistics of the upcoming rhic bes ii , the statistical uncertainties of @xmath0 will be still large .",

    "the qcd based model , polyakovloop extended quark meson ( pqm ) model , shows a clear change on the energy dependence of @xmath0  @xcite . we would further study whether this signal can be observed with the estimated uncertainties of @xmath0 within the upcoming rhic bes ii .    in this paper",

    "results of @xmath0 with statistics lower than required by the clt are also discussed . in section 3",
    ", we will demonstrate the statistics dependence of @xmath0 obtained from cbwc method with various centrality bin widths , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 centrality , and each of @xmath5 , using the urqmd transport model at @xmath13 11.5 gev in au + au collisions .",
    "an appropriate centrality bin width for the cbwc method is suggested . in section 4 ,",
    "the effect of different centrality determination methods , which would lead to different centrality resolutions , for @xmath0 will be discussed .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath0 of the net - proton multiplicity distributions using the urqmd transport model will be discussed as well . due to limited statistics in the recorded data by star during bes i , we will study if the theoretical predicted signal can be observed within uncertainties of @xmath0 at future upcoming rhic bes ii .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in section 6 .",

    "precise @xmath0 values based on qcd calculations with smaller uncertainties are urgent to be obtained before the upcoming rhic bes ii .",
    "[ c6 - 3deviation](b ) clearly shows that the transitional signal of @xmath0 in the pqm model can be totally washed out if @xmath0 is obtained within @xmath9 gev/@xmath7 . even at @xmath19 = 19.6 gev ,",
    "if @xmath20 of deviation from 0.5 is expected to be observed , the required statistics is about 600 m events , according to delta theorem calculations .",

    "the influence of different centrality determinations of @xmath0 are studied .",
    "currently , the centrality determined within @xmath1 is the most acceptable choice to study @xmath0 with star at rhic . at the upcoming rhic bes ii",
    ", we can extract the energy dependence of @xmath0 based on centrality defined by number of charged @xmath37 and @xmath36 produced in the final state within @xmath40 . with statistics comparable to the expected one of bes ii",
    ", no signal of the energy dependence of @xmath0 is observed in central collisions using the urqmd model .    with the estimated uncertainties at the upcoming rhic bes ii , it is found that observing only a negative @xmath0 value is not sufficient .",
    "it can be hidden within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "if the transition signal is as strong as that in the pqm model , it is still challenging to observe it within @xmath35 gev/@xmath7 .",
