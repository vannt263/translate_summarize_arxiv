    "since the discovery of quantum mechanics , entanglement has been considered a very peculiar and purely quantum feature of the physical systems .",
    "its fundamental importance emerged when the experiments showing the violation of the bell inequalities  @xcite , implementing quantum teleportation  @xcite or demonstrating dense coding were performed .",
    "nowadays , entanglement is undoubtedly considered as the key resource of modern and emerging quantum technology , including quantum metrology , quantum computation  @xcite and quantum communications  @xcite .    for this reason ,",
    "a great deal of attention has been devoted to the construction of practical sources of entangled light , both in the domains of discrete and continuous variables . while individual entangled photon pairs arising in spontaneous parametric down - conversion",
    "are commonly used in the discrete domain @xcite , single - mode as well as two - mode squeezed states originating in parametric down - conversion and containing many photon pairs represent the sources in the domain of continuous variables @xcite .",
    "even more complex nonlinear optical processes , including those combining simultaneous parametric down - conversion and frequency up - conversion , have been analyzed as sources of more complex entangled states .",
    "this approach has been experimentally implemented in refs .",

    ", we consider a four - mode system composed of two down - converted modes and two up - converted modes . in the system , parametric down - conversion and frequency up - conversion involving both down - converted modes simultaneously occur in the same nonlinear medium @xcite .",
    "while parametric down - conversion serves as the primary source of entanglement @xcite , frequency up - conversion is responsible for the transfer of the entanglement to the up - converted modes .",
    "this transfer operation is interesting from the fundamental point of view , as it generalizes the well - known property of ` one - mode ' frequency up - conversion pumped by a strong coherent field , in which the statistical properties of the incident field are transferred to the frequency up - converted counterpart , also including the nonclassical ones ( e.g. , squeezing , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that such properties are important for the applications of the up - conversion process : for instance , it has been used many times for ` shifting ' an optical ` one - mode ' field to an appropriate frequency where its detection could be easily achieved  @xcite .    in the general analysis of the four - mode system ,",
    "we quantify its global nonclassicality via the lee nonclassicality depth @xcite .",
    "since the four - mode system under consideration can not exhibit nonclassicality of individual single modes , the global nonclassicality automatically implies the presence of entanglement among the modes ( for a two - mode gaussian system involving parametric down - conversion , see @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of ` the structure of entanglement ' further simplifies by applying the van loock and furusawa inseparability criterion  @xcite that excludes the presence of genuine three- and four - partite entangled states .",
    "this means that in the system discussed here there are only bipartite entangled states .",
    "it is thus sufficient to divide the analyzed four - mode state into different bipartitions to monitor the structure of entanglement .",
    "then , the well - known entanglement criterion based on the positive partial transposition of the statistical operator  @xcite , which gives the logarithmic negativity as an entanglement quantifier , is straightforwardly applied  @xcite .",
    "the experimental detection of two - mode ( -partite ) entanglement is in general quite challenging , as it requires measurements in complementary bases . here",
    ", we theoretically show that , for the considered system with the assumed initial vacuum state , any two - mode partition exhibiting sub - shot - noise intensity correlations is also entangled . as a consequence ,",
    "the measurement of intensity auto- and cross - correlations in this system is sufficient to give the evidence of the presence of two - mode entangled states through the commonly used noise reduction factor .",
    "finally , we note that the hamiltonian of the analyzed four - mode system formally resembles that describing a twin beam with signal and idler fields divided at two beam splitters .",
    "this analogy results in similar properties of the four - mode states obtained in the two cases , though the processes of down - conversion and up - conversion occur simultaneously in our system , at variance with the system with two beam splitters , which modify the already emitted twin beam .",
    "we note that the system with two beam splitters has been frequently addressed in the literature as a prototype of more complex devices based on two multiports that are used to have access to intensity correlation functions for the detailed characterization of the measured fields @xcite , also including their photon - number statistics @xcite .",

    "nonclassicality is also strongly resistant against damping in the system .",

    "4(a ) and ( b ) , the oscillating behavior of negativity @xmath128 is complementary to that of negativity @xmath118 .",
    "this means that the larger values of negativity @xmath129 are accompanied by the lower values of negativity @xmath130 and vice versa .",
    "such a result is a consequence of the fact that the entanglement is due to the presence of photon pairs and a photon created in mode 1 can move to mode 3 and later return back to mode 1 .",
    "this movement leads to the oscillations with frequency @xmath131 , which are clearly visible in figs .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this explanation also suggests that no entanglement is possible between modes 1 and 3 .",
    "indeed , if we also determine the negativity @xmath132 ( or @xmath133 ) , we will get the same values already obtained for the negativity @xmath117 ( @xmath134 ) .    the negativity @xmath115 , characterizing the entanglement between the twin beam in modes 1 and 2 and the up - converted beams in modes 3 and 4 , is plotted in fig .",
    "it reflects the gradual movement of photon pairs from modes 1 and 2 , where they are created , to modes 3 and 4 .",
    "note that the maxima of negativity @xmath135 along the @xmath136-axis occur inbetween the maxima of negativities @xmath117 and @xmath118 . the origin of entanglement in photon pairing is confirmed in the graph of fig .",
    "4(d ) , showing that the negativity @xmath116 is independent of parameter @xmath136 and that the negativity @xmath137 increases with the increasing parameter @xmath138 . in certain sense ,",
    "the independence of negativity @xmath139 from parameter @xmath136 represents the conservation law for nonclassical resources , as the negativities of the different two - mode reductions derived from this bipartition ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 ) do depend on parameter @xmath136 .",
    "the developed model also allows us to study the role of damping in the entanglement creation .",
    "the investigations based on equal damping constants @xmath144 and noiseless reservoirs ( @xmath145 ) just reveal the deterioration of entanglement in all the considered bipartitions with the increase of damping constants ( see fig .",
    "the results of the theoretical analysis suggest that , from the experimental point of view , the observation of entanglement between pairs of modes is substantial for the characterization of the emitted entangled states .",
    "formally , the theory describes such observations through the reduced two - mode statistical operators .",
    "the analysis shows that the behavior of two - mode negativities @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath141 with respect to parameters @xmath148 and @xmath136 is qualitatively similar to that of four - mode negativities @xmath117 , @xmath134 , and @xmath115 plotted in figs .",
    "4(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "this similarity originates in possible ` trajectories ' of photon pairs born in modes 1 and 2 and responsible for the entanglement .",
    "additional insight into the generation of entanglement in the analyzed system is provided when the entanglement is related to the intensities of the interacting fields . as quantified in the graphs of fig .",
    "6 , both mean photon numbers @xmath149 and @xmath150 are increasing functions of parameter @xmath148 and oscillating functions of parameter @xmath136 . this oscillating behavior is particularly interesting , as it reflects the flow of photons from modes 1 and 2 to modes 3 and 4 , respectively , and vice versa .",
    "as we will see below , this is in agreement with the ` flow of the entanglement ' among the modes .",

    "7(a ) shows that the negativity @xmath140 is on the one side an increasing function of the mean photon number @xmath152 , on the other side it only weakly depends on the mean photon number @xmath153 .",
    "this confirms that pairing of photons in parametric down - conversion is the only resource for entanglement creation . on the contrary , as shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) , the negativity @xmath147 is an increasing function of the mean photon number @xmath153 , whereas it weakly depends on the mean photon number @xmath152 .",
    "this indicates that the entanglement in modes 34 comes from modes 12 through the transfer of photon pairs : the stronger the transfer is , the larger the value of negativity @xmath143 is .",
    "moreover , optimal conditions for the observation of entanglement in modes 1 and 4 occur provided that there is the largest available number of photon pairs with one photon in mode 1 and its twin in mode 4 . according to the graph in fig .",
    "7(c ) this occurs when the mean photon numbers @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) and @xmath152 are balanced , independently of their values .    in general ,",
    "the experimental identification of two - mode entanglement is not easy , as it requires the simultaneous measurement of the entangled state in two complementary bases .",
    "alternatively , entanglement can be inferred from the reconstructed two - mode phase - space quasi - distribution , which needs two simultaneous homodyne detectors @xcite , each one endowed with a local oscillator .",
    "however , the detection of entanglement , at least in some cases , can be experimentally accomplished by the observation of sub - shot - noise intensity correlations .",

    "we have @xmath69 .",
    "we can estimate the range of coupling constants achievable in this setup based on the above - mentioned laser source .",
    "let us consider the following parameters : wavelength of the pump for down - conversion @xmath210  nm , @xmath211  nm , wavelength of the pump for up - conversion @xmath212  nm , @xmath213  nm , length of the bab@xmath214o@xmath207 crystal @xmath215  mm , diameters of the pumps 0.5  mm , pulse duration 4.5  ps . the coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath131 are linearly proportional to the corresponding pump field amplitudes so that @xmath216 and @xmath217 , where @xmath218 ( @xmath219 ) are the nonlinear coupling coefficients and @xmath220 ( @xmath221 ) are the pump amplitudes .",

    "four - mode gaussian states generated via parametric down - conversion and frequency up - conversion have been analyzed in terms of nonclassicality , entanglement and entanglement transfer among the modes . while nonclassicality of the state has been described by the easily - computable lee nonclassicality depth ,",
    "logarithmic negativity for different bipartitions has been applied to monitor the occurrence of entanglement among different modes .",
    "it has been shown that whenever the analyzed system is nonclassical , it is also entangled . moreover , the entanglement is present only in the form of bipartite entanglement .",
    "the analysis of the noise reduction factor identifying sub - shot - noise intensity correlations , in parallel with the logarithmic negativity quantifying two - mode entanglement , has shown that the noise reduction factor is a powerful indicator of the entanglement in the analyzed system .",
    "this is substantial for the experimental demonstration of the transfer of entanglement from the down - converted modes to the up - converted ones .    *",
