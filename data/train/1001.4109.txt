    "strong symplectic filling _ if some neighborhood of  @xmath13 admits a @xmath4-form @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "one of the foundational results of modern contact topology was the theorem of gromov @xcite and eliashberg @xcite , that a closed contact @xmath0-manifold admits no symplectic filling if it is overtwisted . in light of more recent developments , nonfillability in the overtwisted case",
    "can be viewed as a corollary of the vanishing of certain invariants , e.g.  contact homology :    if @xmath11 is an overtwisted contact @xmath0-manifold , then its contact homology is trivial .",
    "recall that contact homology ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is a variation on the floer homology of hamiltonian systems , in which the chain complex is generated by closed orbits of a reeb vector field in @xmath11 and the differential counts punctured holomorphic spheres in the symplectization @xmath17 with one positive and finitely many negative ends .",
    "the resulting homology has the structure of a graded commutative algebra with unit , which is then trivial if and only if the unit is exact . in the appendix to @xcite ,",
    "eliashberg sketches a proof of this vanishing result which uses the existence of a solid torus foliated by holomorphic planes with morse - bott asymptotic orbits of arbitrarily small period ( figure  [ fig : lutztube ] ) . after a nondegenerate perturbation of the morse - bott family ,",
    "one finds a distinguished rigid plane that is the only holomorphic curve with its particular asymptotic orbit  @xmath18 at  @xmath19 , giving a relation of the form @xmath20 in the contact homology chain complex .    in recent years , invariants based on holomorphic curves in symplectizations have not been applied much to symplectic filling questions , as there were fairly few existence and uniqueness results that could yield useful calculations , and in any case the analytical foundations of contact homology ( and more generally symplectic field theory ) are still work in progress . in contrast , invariants based on seiberg - witten theory @xcite and heegaard floer homology @xcite have enjoyed great success in detecting new examples of nonfillable contact manifolds .",
    "a test case is provided by the question of giroux torsion , which was suspected since the early 1990 s to furnish an obstruction to strong filling , but this was not proved until 2006 , by david gay @xcite using seiberg - witten theory .",
    "a second proof was produced a short time later , as a consequence of a computation of the ozsvth - szab contact invariant .",
    "in particular :    if @xmath11 has giroux torsion , then its ozsvth - szab contact invariant vanishes . moreover , if the giroux torsion domain ( see definition  [ defn : girouxtorsion ] ) separates  @xmath10 , then the ozsvth - szab invariant with twisted coefficients also vanishes .",
    "the vanishing result with twisted coefficients , proved in @xcite , provides a new proof of the original eliashberg - gromov result for overtwisted contact manifolds , in addition to a large new class of tight contact @xmath0-manifolds that are not weakly fillable .",
    "quite recently , patrick massot @xcite has also produced examples of contact manifolds with no giroux torsion for which the untwisted ozsvth - szab invariant vanishes .",
    "holomorphic curves recently reappeared in this subject through a third proof of the giroux torsion result , due to the author @xcite .",
    "though it was not presented as such in that paper , the argument in @xcite can be viewed as a vanishing result for the _ ech contact invariant _",
    ", i.e.  the distinguished class in embedded contact homology that is conjectured to be isomorphic to the ozsvth - szab contact invariant , and recently proved by taubes @xcite to be isomorphic to the corresponding object in seiberg - witten floer homology .",

    "the homology of the resulting chain complex is the embedded contact homology @xmath25 . and",
    "@xmath6 , but due to the isomorphism with seiberg - witten floer homology , it is now known that @xmath25 is an invariant of @xmath11 , and actually even defines a topological invariant .",

    "it vanishes whenever one can find an orbit set @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30 which follows from the existence of a unique embedded @xmath6-holomorphic curve with positive ends approaching the orbits represented by @xmath29 , and no negative ends .",
    "it should be clear why eliashberg s calculation of vanishing contact homology fits into this framework , and the proof in @xcite uses a similar construction : instead of a family of planes , giroux torsion gives a family of holomorphic cylinders ( figure  [ fig : girouxtorsiondomain ] ) which can be shown to be the _ only _ cylinders asymptotic to their particular reeb orbits .",
    "an embedded @xmath6-holomorphic plane asymptotic to a reeb orbit of small period in a morse - bott family ( arrows indicate the reeb vector field ) .",
    "every overtwisted contact manifold contains a solid torus that can be foliated by a family of such planes , each of which is a subset of an overtwisted disk . ]",
    "any contact manifold with giroux torsion contains a thickened torus foliated by @xmath6-holomorphic cylinders asymptotic to morse - bott reeb orbits of small period . ]    the constructions in figures  [ fig : lutztube ] and  [ fig : girouxtorsiondomain ] can be recast in purely contact geometric terms by interpreting the embedded holomorphic curves as pages of open book decompositions that support the contact structure , where the binding circles have been `` blown up , '' i.e.  replaced by @xmath31-tori . in both cases there is also an extra region of `` padding '' just outside the blown up open book , which is also foliated by surfaces transverse to the reeb vector field .",
    "from this perspective , one can imagine using similar ideas with more general open books to define much more general filling obstructions , and this will be the main subject in the present paper .",
    "in particular , we shall reinterpret both overtwistedness and giroux torsion within the framework of an infinite hierarchy of new filling obstructions that we call _ planar torsion_. its definition combines two simple notions that are fundamental in contact topology : open book decompositions supporting contact structures , as introduced by giroux @xcite , and the contact fiber sum along codimension  2 contact submanifolds , originally due to gromov @xcite and geiges @xcite .",
    "we will define a contact manifold to have _",
    "planar @xmath1-torsion _ for some integer @xmath2 if it contains a certain kind of subset called a _",
    "planar @xmath1-torsion domain_. roughly speaking , the latter is a compact contact @xmath0-manifold @xmath11 , possibly with boundary , that contains a nonempty set of disjoint pre - lagrangian tori dividing it into two pieces :    * a _ planar piece _ @xmath32 , which is disjoint from @xmath33 and looks like a connected open book with some binding components blown up and/or attached to each other by contact fiber sums .",
    "the pages must have genus zero and @xmath34 boundary components . *",
    "the _ padding _",
    "@xmath35 , which contains @xmath33 and consists of one or more arbitrary open books , again with some binding components blown up or fiber summed together .     various planar @xmath1-torsion domains , with the order  @xmath2 indicated within the planar piece .",
    "each picture shows a surface @xmath36 that defines a manifold @xmath37 with an @xmath38-invariant contact structure  @xmath9 .",
    "the multicurves that divide @xmath36 are the sets of all points @xmath39 at which @xmath40 is legendrian .",
    "see also figure  [ fig : moretorsion ] . ]    the tori bounding @xmath32 are themselves the result of a contact fiber sum operation that attaches two separate open books to each other along components of their binding .",
    "some simple special cases of the form @xmath37 are shown in figure  [ fig : torsiondomains ] , and we will give a precise explanation of the general construction in  [ subsec : definition ] .",
    "in a limited set of cases , summing open books together in this way leads to a contact manifold that may be strongly fillable , but whose fillings can be classified up to symplectic deformation in terms of diffeomorphism classes of lefschetz fibrations  this classification will be examined in the follow - up paper @xcite . outside of these cases ,",
    "the result is always a nonfillable contact manifold , and this situation will be our focus in all that follows .",
    "more precise versions of the following results will be explained in   [ subsec : definition ] .       1 .",
    "if @xmath11 has planar @xmath1-torsion for any integer @xmath2 , then it is not strongly fillable ; in fact , it does not admit a contact type embedding into any closed symplectic @xmath41-manifold ( cf .",
    "theorems  [ thm : nonseparating ] and  [ thm : nonfillable ] ) .",
    "moreover , its untwisted ech contact invariant vanishes ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ thm : ech ] ) .",
    "2 .   under an extra topological assumption on a planar torsion domain",
    ", analogues of the above statements also hold for _ weak _ fillings and the _ twisted _ ech contact invariant ( cf .  theorem  [ thm : twisted ] ) .",
    "@xmath11 has planar @xmath3-torsion if and only if it is overtwisted , and every contact manifold with giroux torsion also has planar @xmath4-torsion ( cf .",
    "corollary  [ cor : lowertorsion ] ) .",
    "4 .   for every integer @xmath5 , there",
    "exist contact manifolds that have planar @xmath1-torsion but no giroux torsion ( cf .  corollary  [ cor : higherorder ] and figure  [ fig : nogirouxtorsion ] ) .",
    "if @xmath11 is supported by an open book decomposition with binding @xmath42 , then @xmath43 has no planar @xmath1-torsion for any @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ thm : complement ] ) .",
    "one can rephrase the above results by defining a contact invariant , @xmath44 which takes values in @xmath45 and is infinite if and only if @xmath11 has no planar torsion .",
    "then @xmath46 always implies that @xmath11 is not strongly fillable , and one can think of manifolds with larger values of @xmath47 as being `` closer '' to being fillable , a statement that can be made more precise in the algebraic setting of symplectic field theory , cf .",
    "our results thus show that @xmath48 whenever @xmath11 has giroux torsion , @xmath49 if and only if @xmath11 is overtwisted , and there exist contact manifolds without giroux torsion such that @xmath46 .",
    "one can show in fact that the examples treated in corollary  [ cor : higherorder ] have @xmath50 for any given integer @xmath5 , but this requires sft methods which go beyond the scope of the present paper , see @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the scale defined by the invariant @xmath47 measures something completely different from the standard quantitative measurement of giroux torsion ; the latter counts the maximum number of adjacent giroux torsion domains that can be embedded in @xmath11 , and can take arbitrarily large values while @xmath48 .",
    "likewise , @xmath11 has giroux torsion zero whenever @xmath51 .",
    "note that whenever the ech contact invariant of @xmath11 vanishes , the taubes isomorphism together with results in seiberg - witten theory @xcite imply the fact that @xmath11 is not fillable , but this makes for an extremely indirect proof of nonfillability .",
    "the _ right _ proof in our context should be one that uses only holomorphic curves , and for the case of planar torsion and strong fillings we will also do this , thus avoiding the use of seiberg - witten theory .",
    "there is a similarly more direct proof for the result on weak fillings , which is carried out in a separate paper of the author with klaus niederkrger @xcite .",
    "the simplest examples of planar @xmath1-torsion with @xmath5 are manifolds of the form @xmath37 with @xmath38-invariant contact structures : we will explain these in  [ subsec : examples ] .",
    "the proofs of the results stated above and in  [ subsec : definition ] will then be given in ",
    "[ sec : proofs ] , based on some more technical results in  [ sec : openbook ] .    the technical work that makes these computations possible is a new existence and uniqueness theorem , proved in ",
    "[ subsec : bigtheorem ] , for certain holomorphic curves in the presence of supporting open book decompositions .",
    "let us briefly explain the main idea and its context .",
    "we recall first some basic notions involving open books : if @xmath10 is a closed and oriented @xmath0-manifold , an _",
    "open book decomposition _ is a fibration @xmath52 where @xmath42 is an oriented link called the _ binding _ , and the closures of the fibers are called _ pages _ : these are compact , oriented and embedded surfaces with oriented boundary equal to  @xmath53 .",
    "an open book is called _ planar _ if the pages are connected and have genus zero , and it is said to _ support _ a contact structure @xmath9 if the latter can be written as @xmath54 for some contact form @xmath14 ( called a _ giroux form _ ) whose induced reeb vector field @xmath55 is positively transverse to the interiors of the pages and positively tangent to the binding .",
    "the latter definition is due to giroux @xcite , who established a groundbreaking one - to - one correspondence between isomorphism classes of contact manifolds and their supporting open books up to right - handed stabilization .",
    "historically , open books appeared in contact topology much earlier via the existence theorem of thurston and winkelnkemper @xcite , which in modern terminology says that every open book decomposition on a @xmath0-manifold supports a contact structure . in the 1990 s",
    ", they also appeared in dynamical applications due to hofer , wysocki and zehnder @xcite , whose work exploited the fact that certain families of punctured , asymptotically cylindrical @xmath6-holomorphic curves in the symplectization @xmath17 of a contact @xmath0-manifold  @xmath10 naturally give rise to the pages of supporting open books on  @xmath10indeed , whenever such a curve has an embedded projection to  @xmath10 , the nonlinear cauchy - riemann equation guarantees that this embedding is also positively transverse to  @xmath55 .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether _ every _ supporting open book can be lifted in this way to a family of holomorphic curves in the symplectization , typically referred to as a _",
    "holomorphic open book_.    hofer observed in @xcite a fundamental problem with this idea in general : looking closely at the punctured version of the riemann - roch formula , one finds that the space of holomorphic curves with the necessary intersection theoretic properties to form open books has the correct dimension if and only if the genus is zero , and otherwise its virtual dimension is too low .",
    "thus for planar open books there is no trouble  this fact was used by abbas , cieliebak and hofer @xcite to solve the weinstein conjecture for planar contact manifolds , and has since also found applications to the study of symplectic fillings @xcite .",
    "hofer suggested handling the higher genus case by introducing a `` cohomological perturbation '' into the nonlinear cauchy - riemann equation in order to raise the fredholm index .",
    "this program has recently been carried out by casim abbas @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , though applications to problems such as the weinstein conjecture are as yet elusive , as the compactness theory for the modified nonlinear cauchy - riemann equation is quite difficult ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "an alternative approach was introduced by the present author in @xcite , which produced a concrete construction of the planar holomorphic open books needed for the applications @xcite and @xcite , but also produced a _",
    "non - generic _ construction that works for arbitrary open books , of any genus .",
    "the non - generic construction breaks down under small perturbations of the data , which may seem to limit its value , but in fact it is quite useful : we will adapt it in  [ sec : openbook ] to extend the results of @xcite to a full classification of @xmath6-holomorphic curves in @xmath17 whose positive ends approach the binding orbits of a supporting open book .",
    "we shall do this in a more general context , involving not just one but potentially an ensemble of open books with some of their binding orbits blown up and attached to each other by contact fiber sums .",
    "the key fact making all of this possible is that the specific almost complex structure for which holomorphic open books always exist is compatible with an _ exact _ stable hamiltonian structure , which admits a well behaved perturbation to a suitable contact form . for the ensemble of open books provided by a planar torsion domain , this result will make it easy to find an orbit set in the ech chain complex that satisfies @xmath56 .",
    "the results in  [ sec : openbook ] have further applications not treated in this paper , of which the most obvious is the computation of a related filling obstruction that lives in symplectic field theory .",
    "the latter is a generalization of contact homology introduced by eliashberg , givental and hofer @xcite , that defines contact invariants by counting @xmath6-holomorphic curves with arbitrary genus and positive and negative ends in symplectizations of arbitrary dimension .",
    "as shown in joint work of the author with janko latschev @xcite , sft contains a natural notion of _ algebraic _ torsion , which one can define as follows . in the picture developed by cieliebak and latschev in @xcite , sft associates to any contact manifold with appropriate choices of contact form and almost complex structure a graded @xmath57-algebra generated by the symbols @xmath58 ( for each `` good '' closed reeb orbit  @xmath18 ) and  @xmath59 ;",
    "the latter can be regarded as part of the coefficient ring , but must be handled with care since it has a nontrivial degree .",
    "the homology of this @xmath57-algebra is then an invariant of the contact structure , and it is natural to say that @xmath11 has _ algebraic @xmath1-torsion _ if the homology satisfies the relation @xmath60 = 0.\\ ] ] for @xmath61 , this means @xmath62 and thus coincides with the notion of _ algebraic overtwistedness _",
    "it follows easily from the formalism of sft that algebraic torsion of any order gives an obstruction to strong symplectic filling ; in fact it is stronger , since it also implies obstructions to the existence of exact symplectic cobordisms between certain contact manifolds .",
    "we will not go into these matters any further here , except to mention the following justification for keeping track of the integer @xmath2 in planar @xmath1-torsion :    if @xmath11 has planar @xmath1-torsion , then it also has algebraic @xmath1-torsion .",
    "the fact that planar torsion obstructs symplectic filling can thus also be viewed as a consequence of a computation in sft . in @xcite",
    ", we show that among the examples treated in ",
    "[ subsec : examples ] , one can find contact manifolds @xmath63 for any integer @xmath64 that have algebraic torsion of order  @xmath1 but not  @xmath65 : it follows that @xmath1 is also the smallest integer for which @xmath63 has planar @xmath1-torsion .",
    "the formalism of sft then implies that there is no exact symplectic cobordism with positive boundary @xmath66 and negative boundary @xmath67 if @xmath68 .",
    "thus the enhanced algebraic structure of sft leads to non - existence results that are not immediately apparent from any of the distinctly @xmath0-dimensional invariants discussed above .",
    "another obvious advantage of sft is that one can sensibly define algebraic torsion for contact manifolds of arbitrary dimensions , not only dimension  @xmath0 . in higher dimensions",
    "however , no examples are yet known except for @xmath3-torsion , e.g.  a contact manifold",
    "is algebraically overtwisted whenever it contains a _ plastikstufe _ @xcite or is supported by a left - handed stabilization of an open book @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to make the aforementioned definitions and results precise .",
    "assume @xmath10 is an oriented smooth manifold containing two disjoint oriented submanifolds @xmath69 of real codimension  @xmath31 , which admit an orientation preserving diffeomorphism @xmath70 covered by an orientation reversing isomorphism @xmath71 of their normal bundles .",
    "then we can define a new smooth manifold @xmath72 , the _ normal sum _ of @xmath10 along @xmath73 , by removing neighborhoods @xmath74 and @xmath75 of @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively , then gluing together the resulting manifolds with boundary along an orientation reversing diffeomorphism @xmath78 determined by  @xmath73 .",
    "this operation determines @xmath72 up to diffeomorphism , and is also well defined in the contact cateogory : if @xmath11 is a contact manifold and @xmath79 are contact submanifolds with @xmath70 a contactomorphism , then @xmath72 admits a contact structure @xmath80 , unique up to isotopy , which agrees with @xmath9 away from @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( cf .",
    "@xcite*7.4 ) .",
    "we then call @xmath81 the _ contact fiber sum _ of @xmath11 along  @xmath73",
    ".    we will consider the special case of this construction where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are disjoint components of the binding of an open book decomposition @xmath82 that supports  @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath76 and @xmath77 are automatically contact submanifolds , whose normal bundles come with distinguished trivializations determined by the open book . in the following , we shall always assume that @xmath10 is oriented and the pages and binding are assigned the natural orientations determined by the open book , so in particular the binding is the oriented boundary of the pages .",
    "assume @xmath83 is an open book decomposition on @xmath10 . by a _ binding sum _ of the open book ,",
    "we mean any normal sum @xmath72 along an orientation reversing bundle isomorphism @xmath71 covering a diffeomorphism @xmath70 , where @xmath84 are disjoint components of the binding and @xmath73 is constant with respect to the distinguished trivialization determined by  @xmath85 .",
    "the resulting smooth manifold will be denoted by @xmath86 and we denote by @xmath87 the closed hypersurface obtained by the identification of @xmath88 with @xmath89 , which we ll also call the _ interface_. we will then refer to the data @xmath90 as a _ summed open book decomposition _ of @xmath91 ,",
    "whose _ binding _ is the ( possibly empty ) codimension  @xmath31 submanifold @xmath92 the _ pages _ of @xmath90 are the connected components of the fibers of the naturally induced fibration @xmath93 if @xmath94 , then these are naturally oriented open surfaces whose closures are generally immersed ( distinct boundary components may sometimes coincide ) .",

    "it follows from the corresponding fact for ordinary open books that every summed open book decomposition supports a contact structure , which is unique up to isotopy : in fact it depends only on the isotopy class of the open book @xmath83 , the choice of binding components @xmath84 and isotopy class of diffeomorphism @xmath70 .    throughout this discussion , @xmath10 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and the pages of @xmath85",

    "in fact , each of the tight contact tori @xmath122 , where @xmath123\\ ] ] in coordinates @xmath124 , can be obtained as a binding sum of @xmath125 copies of the tight @xmath126 ; see figure  [ fig : t3 ] .",

    "a simple example of this construction is @xmath128 as explained in example  [ ex : t3 ] , and for an even simpler example , summing two open books with disk - like pages produces the tight @xmath126 .",
    "[ remark : quasi ] there is a close relationship between summed open books and the notion of open books with quasi - compatible contact structures , introduced by etnyre and van horn - morris @xcite .",
    "a contact structure  @xmath9 is said to be _ quasi - compatible _ with an open book if it admits a contact vector field that is positively transverse to the pages and positively tangent to the binding ; if the contact vector field is also positively transverse to  @xmath9 , then this is precisely the supporting condition , but quasi - compatibility is quite a bit more general , and can allow e.g.  open books with empty binding .",
    "a summed open book on a @xmath0-manifold gives rise to an open book with quasi - compatible contact structure whenever a certain orientation condition is satisfied : this is the result in particular whenever we construct binding sums of separate open books that are labeled with signs in such a way that every interface torus separates a positive piece from a negative piece .",
