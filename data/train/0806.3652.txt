    "the associative memory hamiltonian ( amh ) @xcite , is a coarse - grained molecular mechanics potential inspired by physical models of the protein folding process , but flexibly incorporates bioinformatic data to predict protein structure .",
    "the amh is first optimised using the minimal frustration principle in terms of the @xmath0 ratio , which estimates the separation in energy relative to the variance for the misfolded ensemble .",
    "along with using the energy of the native structure to estimate @xmath1 , a random energy model@xcite estimate of the glass transition temperature , @xmath2 , is used based on a set of decoy structures .",
    "@xmath2 represents a characteristic temperature scale at which kinetic trapping in misfolded states dominates the dynamics .",
    "an improved potential is next obtained that uses better estimates of the @xmath0 ratio obtained by maximizing the normalized difference between the native state and a sampled set of misfolded decoys which are self - consistently obtained from the potential itself .",
    "the potential so obtained is transferable for the prediction of structures outside of the training set .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 has provided a powerful metric for the optimisation of both this bioinformatically informed energy function @xcite , as well as other types of energy functions incorporating only physical information @xcite .",
    "while the optimisation @xcite of parameters using a training set of evolved natural proteins smooths the energy landscape from what it would be for a random hetero - polymer , the common problem of multiple competing minima persists even when using a reasonably accurate structure prediction potential , such as this one .",
    "simulated annealing with molecular dynamics has previously been used to search the rugged landscapes of optimised structure prediction potentials @xcite . while free energy profiles indicate that better structures actually are present at low temperatures , the slow kinetics of a glass - like transition during annealing has prevented these minima from being reached @xcite . to quantitatively investigate the origin of the sampling difficulties it is desirable to use different search strategies .    here",
    "we implement the basin - hopping global optimisation algorithm @xcite , which has proved capable of overcoming large energetic barriers in a wide range of different systems .",

    "furthermore , it does not alter the nature of the local minima since the hamiltonian itself is not changed , enabling the comparison between molecular dynamics and basin - hopping generated minima .",
    "this method has previously been applied to find global minima in atomic and molecular clusters @xcite , biopolymers @xcite , and solids @xcite .",
    "since the algorithm only requires coordinates , energies , and gradients , it can be transferred between different molecular systems such as binary lennard - jones clusters , all - atom biomolecules , or coarse - grained proteins models as in this study .",

    "it is preferable to ignoring the interactions altogether .",
    "finally , we made several _",

    "previously @xcite , we have seen that modifying @xmath4 can produce a less frustrated energy surface when using thermal equilibrium sampling , but slow dynamics was often found to result since the local barrier heights became too large .",
    "the ability of basin - hopping to overcome such large , but local barriers allows us therefore to consider a potential whose dynamics would otherwise be too slow for molecular dynamics . in the final part of the paper , we altered the excluded volume term , as shown in eq .",

    "this replacement permits the location of local minima without requiring an internal coordinate transformation , and avoids discontinuous gradients .",
    "when minimised , the additional harmonic terms typically contribute only only .015 @xmath64 per bond .",
    "the remaining terms of the original backbone potential are maintained .",
    "depending on the sidechain , the neighbouring residues in sequence sterically limit the variety of positions the backbone atoms can occupy , as evidenced in a ramachandran plot @xcite . this distribution of coordinates is reinforced by a potential , @xmath65 , with artificially low barriers to encourage rapid local movements .",

    "whose algorithm is outlined in fig .",
    "[ pseudocode ] the most important sampling parameters are the temperature used in the accept / reject steps for local minima @xmath68 , and the maximum step size for perturbations of the cartesian coordinates @xmath69 .",
    "a higher temperature allows transitions to an increased energy minima to be accepted , and also creates a larger the number of iterations typically required to minimise the greater perturbed configurations .",
    "too high a temperature leads to insufficient exploration of low - energy regions .",
    "the temperature ( @xmath68 ) for these simulations was 10 @xmath70 .",
    "lower temperatures resulted in slower escape rates from low energy traps , while higher temperatures prevented adequate exploration of low energy regions .",
    "the step size needs to be large enough to move the configuration into the basin of attraction of one local minimum to a neighbouring one , but not be so large that the new minimum is unrelated to the previous state .",
    "every cartesian coordinate was displaced up to a maximum step size(@xmath69 ) of @xmath71 , the optimum value determined from preliminary tests .",
    "each run consisted of 2500 basin - hopping steps saving structures every 5 basin - hopping steps .",
    "the convergence condition ( @xmath72 ) on the root - mean - square ( rms ) gradient for each minimisation was set to @xmath73 , and the 5 lowest - lying minima from each run were subsequently converged more tightly ( @xmath74 ) to an rms gradient of @xmath75 .",
    "it is important to note that basin - hopping does not provide equilibrium thermodynamic sampling . in structure prediction there , however , is no rigorous need for the search to obey detailed balance since the global energy minimum is the primary interest .",
    "basin - hopping provides a means for the optimal global search of the energy landscape , however other methods must be used when calculating free energy and entropy .",
    "in previous structure prediction studies with the amh , low energy structures were identified using off - lattice langevin dynamics with simulated annealing , employing a linear annealing schedule of 10000 steps from a temperature of 2.0 to 0.0 , starting from a random configuration @xcite .",
    "the number and length of simulations needed in both strategies were determined by the number of uncorrelated structures encountered . the current basin - hopping method with the amc energy function encounters roughly one deep trap per run . in order to sample 100 independent structures in molecular dynamics 20 separate runs",
    "were needed , because simulated annealing samples about five independent states before the glass transition temperature is encountered , as measured by the rapid decay of structural correlations .",
    "we compared several @xmath3 helical proteins , both from within and outside the training set of the amh energy function .",
    "we performed initial calculations with a g potential for the 434 repressor ( protein data bank ( pdb @xcite ) i d 1r69 ) . in fig .",
    "[ go_q ] we show this model accurately represents the native basin .",
    "steps where the energy increases are allowed by the sampling method and are not examples of frustration .",
    "studies on the g model provide a useful benchmark for comparing the computer time required for the different global optimisation strategies . using the sampling parameters used in this report",
    ", we compared the time for initial collapse between the molecular dynamics and basin - hopping runs . the initial collapse required about 7 minutes for the annealing runs and 31 minutes for basin - hopping on a desktop computer .",
    "however , these values do not reflect the actual performance of the two approaches in locating global minima , which will depend upon the move sets , step size , temperature , and convergence criteria .",
    "while using the amc structure prediction hamiltonian , we found that basin - hopping was often able to locate lower energy structures and also identified minima that have greater structural overlap with the native state than annealing .",
    "these results are produced for structure predictions for proteins both inside and outside the training set , as demonstrated in table  [ gmin_compare ] .",
    "the first three proteins ( pdb i d 1r69 , 3icb , 256b ) in table  [ gmin_compare ] are in the training set of the hamiltonian @xcite , while the other three are not , and can therefore be considered as predictions from the algorithm . the minima located with basin - hopping show an increase in structural overlap with the native state [ eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) ] when compared to the langevin dynamics approach .",
    "@xmath43 scores of 0.4 for single domain proteins generally correspond to a low resolution root mean square deviation ( rmsd ) of around 5 or better .",
    "@xmath43 scores of 0.5 and higher have still more accurate tertiary packing and are of comparable quality to the experimentally derived models .",
    "the high quality structures obtained suggest the form of the backbone terms is appropriate , since the physically correct stereochemistry is reproduced .",
    "lower energy structures are sampled by basin - hopping for the non - training set proteins , but the structural overlap improvement found in these deeper minima was smaller .",
    "larger proteins pose a greater challenge for basin - hopping with this hamiltonian due to the random steps in cartesian coordinates .",
    "dihedral coordinate move steps would probably be more efficient , and will be considered in future work .    the distribution of minima encountered from multiple simulations for both search methods is shown in fig .  [ gmin_anneal ] where a greater density of high quality structures is obtained by the basin - hopping algorithm .",
    "the potential energy surface still includes , therefore , significant residual frustration in the near - native basin in the form of low - lying minima separated by relatively high barriers . without the parameter optimisation to reduce frustration , folding would exhibit more pronounced glassy characteristics .",
    "most of the cooperative folding occurs during collapse until @xmath43 values of around 0.4 are reached . while the structures from simulated annealing are accurate enough for functional determination , we see basin - hopping can better overcome barriers that are created after collapse .",
    "the density of the high quality structures is also important for post - simulation k - means clustering analysis @xcite .",
    "another way of representing the data of a set of independent basin - hopping simulations is by selecting the lowest energy structures from each simulation of the 434 repressor ( pdb i d 1r69 ) and hdea ( pdb i d 1bg8 ) proteins and ordering them with respect to their structural overlap . as shown in fig .",
    "[ yield_plot ] , the protein in the training set ( 434 repressor ) produces better results than the non - training protein , as expected .",
    "we have decomposed the different energy terms in the hamiltonian in table  [ terms ] , to examine which interactions are most effectively minimised .",
    "the amc potential has three different distance classes in terms of sequence separation , and these are defined as short ( @xmath76 ) , medium ( @xmath77 ) , and long ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "most importantly , the long - range amh interactions are successfully minimised in the basin - hopping runs , due to the ability of basin - hopping to overcome large energetic barriers .",
    "this term will govern the quality of structures sampled using an approximately smooth energy landscape .",
    "the other terms that define secondary structure formation are not as well minimised .",
    "this result is due to the disruption of helices by the random cartesian perturbation move steps .",
    "these move steps benefit favorable steric packing and therefore do well at minimising the excluded volume energy term of the hamiltonian .",
    "a combined minimisation approach might be more efficient , where larger dihedral steps could be made early during minimisation to sample a wider number of structures , followed by random cartesian steps to optimise the steric interactions .",
    "while we sampled high quality structures , we would like to confirm that we have completely sampled the global minima of the energy surface . to access these unsampled states we used umbrella potentials .",
    "when constraining a set of simulations to different values of @xmath43 , we have obtained energy minima for cytochrome c , roughly @xmath79 deeper than those from unconstrained minimisations starting with a randomized structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ q_const_256b ] . for the 434 repressor",
    "the minima obtained from randomized states and those found with the @xmath43 constraints applied differ by only a few @xmath64 .",
    "this shows basin - hopping does indeed act as a global optimisation method , by accurately identifying the global energy minimum from multiple independent unconstrained simulation .",
    "this behavior is predictable from the choices that governed the design of the hamiltonian .",
    "low energy barriers between structures are desirable during a molecular dynamics simulation because they accelerate the dynamics .",
    "however , for basin - hopping these low barriers encourage tertiary contact formation before secondary structure units condense for sequences greater than 110 amino acids .",
    "constructing a hamiltonian by calculating the arithmetic average of the potential over a set of homologous sequences increased the quality of predictions in both equilibrium and annealing simulations .",
    "we have found this approach also improved the performance in basin - hopping simulations .",
    "for two different proteins , 100 independent basin - hopping runs were performed with both the standard and sequence - averaged hamiltonians . by the superposition of multiple energy landscapes we saw a reduction in the number of competing low energy traps around @xmath43 values of @xmath80 for both the 434 repressor and uteroglobin ( pdb i d 1utg ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ seq_ave ] .",
    "improvement of structure prediction hamiltonians can be statistically described by the average energy gap between the native basin and a set of unfolded structures , and by the roughness of the energy surface , which corresponds to the variance of the energy .",
    "the sequence based energy function summations limited the energetic variance of the sampled landscapes , thereby reducing the glass transition temperature .",
    "this improvement , even at the low temperatures sampled in basin - hopping , is predicted from theory , but difficult to observe in conventional equilibrium simulations due to the emergent glassy dynamics , which slows the kinetics .",
    "the energy gap improvement was smaller than the reduction of the energetic variation of the hamiltonian . in terms of the goal of maximizing the ratio of @xmath0 , this increase came primarily from to reducing the glass transition temperature @xmath2 . in the low energy region",
    "we saw fewer competing states , and an increased correlation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the sequence - averaged hamiltonian compared to the original hamiltonian . for the 434 repressor",
    "the lowest energy structure had the highest @xmath43 value encountered .",
    "when we annealed the hamiltonian using molecular dynamics we observed some over - collapse of the polypeptide chain , producing a smaller radius of gyration than the experimental structure . in basin - hopping runs",

    "[ 434_over_collapse ] , where a contact is defined as a c@xmath6-c@xmath6 distance of less than 8 . while the low - energy structures may be native - like , these structures were more compact than those observed experimentally . to investigate this behavior , we examined the backbone and interaction terms of the hamiltonian separately using the g hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ go_eq ] ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the g model also produces over - collapse , as shown in fig .",
    "[ go_collapse ] .",
    "hence the interaction parameters of the structure prediction hamiltonian were not responsible for all of the over - collapse .",
    "these minimal model - dependent frustrations were only eliminated in the final stages of minimisation .",
    "the most effective technique for reducing over - collapse was to increase the force constant and the atomic radius in the excluded volume terms [ eq .",
    "( [ ev_eq ] ) ] .",
    "the barrier crossing capabilities of basin - hopping steps produce more over - collapse than do the annealing minimisations without these parameter changes .",

    "[ 434_fixed ] shows more native - like collapse , but the lowest energy structures had @xmath43 values of 0.36 and the best @xmath43 value was 0.45 , which are worse than basin - hopping simulations with the original parameters .",
    "in this report we have demonstrated that minima with lower energy and higher quality structures can often be located for the amh potential using basin - hopping global optimisation compared to annealing .",
    "encouragingly , the long range in sequence energy contributions are better minimised than with simulated annealing .",

    "previous techniques for reducing the energetic variance of the energy surface in simulated annealing are also applicable to basin - hopping . using basin - hopping",
    "also permits improvements in certain backbone terms of the hamiltonian .",
    "these changes would make the kinetics too slow in molecular dynamics annealing runs , but larger barriers can be easily crossed using basin - hopping .",
