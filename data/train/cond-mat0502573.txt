    "complex fluids in which the particles are similar in character but not strictly identical , are termed polydisperse . examples of such arise throughout soft matter science , notably in colloidal dispersions , polymer solutions and liquid - crystals .",
    "typically the polydispersity of these systems is manifest as variation in some physical attribute such as size , shape or charge , which one denotes by a continuous parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the form of the polydispersity is then quantifiable in terms of a density distribution @xmath4 measuring the number density of particles of each @xmath0 . accordingly one can regard the system as a mixture of an infinite number of particle `` species '' each labelled by the value of @xmath0 @xcite .    as has long been appreciated , polydispersity can deeply influence the thermodynamical and processing properties of complex fluids @xcite , making a clear elucidation of its detailed role a matter of both fundamental and practical importance .",
    "the majority of recent effort in this regard has focussed on clarifying the bulk phase behaviour of polydisperse systems ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , which is known to be considerable richer in both variety and character than that of corresponding monodisperse systems .",
    "the source of this richness can be traced to _ fractionation _ effects : at coexistence a polydisperse fluid described by some initial `` parent '' distribution , @xmath1 , may split into two or more ` daughter ' phases @xmath5 , @xmath6 , each of which differs in composition from the parent .",
    "the sole constraint is that the volumetric average of the daughter distributions equals the parent distribution",
    ".    the effect of fractionation on phase diagrams can be dramatic .",
    "for instance , the familiar liquid - vapor binodal in the density - temperature plane of a monodisperse fluid splits into cloud and shadow curves @xcite , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem](a ) .",
    "these mark , respectively , the density of the onset of phase separation and the density of the incipient ( shadow ) phase .",
    "the critical point occurs neither at the extremum of the cloud nor the shadow curve but at their intersection .",
    "one implication of this is that even at the critical temperature , liquid vapor coexistence can occur provided the overall parent density is less than its critical value .",
    "additional insight into fractionation effects can be gleaned from the pressure - temperature plane of the phase diagram . in a monodisperse system",
    ", coexistence occurs along a line in this plane which terminates at the critical point .",
    "however , the introduction of polydispersity broadens this line into a _ region _ having a ` banana'-like shape @xcite .",
    "the critical point generally lies neither at a point of maximum temperature nor maximum pressure on the perimeter of this region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem](b ) ) . traversing the coexistence region from one pure phase to the other ( eg . along an isobar or isotherm ) corresponds to _ smoothly _ varying the relative volumes of the system occupied by the two coexisting phases , with concomitant smooth variation in the forms of the daughter distributions .",

    "these investigations focussed principally on the effect of the wall on the local fluid structure and distribution of particle sizes .",
    "however , since no explicit interparticle attraction was considered , issues of wetting and fluid - fluid coexistence did not arise .",
    "the sole previous study of a fluid - fluid interface in a polydisperse system ( of which we are aware ) is the density functional theory study of bellier - castella _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "building on previous studies of a homogeneous polydisperse van der waals fluid @xcite , these authors obtained the density profiles for various species across a planar liquid - vapor interface .",
    "their calculations indicated a preferential adsorption of small particles at the interface which they reported to be broadened with respect to the monodisperse limit .    in the present work ,",
    "we have attempted to extend the understanding of interfacial behaviour in polydisperse fluids by performing detailed monte carlo simulations of a system of spherical size - disperse particles interacting via a lennard - jones potential .",

    "such `` fixed polydispersity '' corresponds to the experimental situation in , for example , colloidal dispersions or polymer solutions , where the form of the parent distribution is prescribed by the synthesis process of the particles , and only its scale can change depending on the quantity of solvent present .",

    "good fits of the @xmath70 form ( eq .  [ eq : tanh ] ) were achieved for the profiles of the overall number density , volume fraction and local average particle size .",
    "additionally , a further measure , the @xmath131 width of the symmetrized surface segregation profile , @xmath125 , was examined @xcite .",
    "this latter quantity contains explicit information on the density profiles of the individual species @xmath98 , which , it seems , is important in obtaining reliable estimates of the interfacial width .",
    "by contrast , the overall profiles @xmath66 and @xmath67 , integrate out some , or all , of the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath57 .",
    "they thus suppress information about species whose individual profile width is large , but which contribute relatively little weight to the overall density .",
    "this may result in an underestimate of the true length scale over which the system properties deviate from their bulk values , and indeed the discrepancies we find in the interfacial width for the various profiles ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) provide some evidence for this .",
    "we note further that if one simply examines the overall density profile , one may miss important features such as the segregation peak , which is apparent in @xmath98 for small @xmath0 , but not in @xmath66 .",
    "turning now to the effects of polydispersity on the width of the liquid - vapor interface , it is stated in ref.@xcite that polydispersity broadens the interface compared to the monodisperse limit .",
    "however , our results highlight the need for care when attempting to isolate the intrinsic effects of polydispersity on the interfacial width from those arising indirectly as a result of polydispersity - induced alterations to the bulk phase behaviour . indeed , the latter may well constitute the dominant factor .",
    "for example , introducing polydispersity of the form described by eq .",
    "[ eq : ljpot ] ( which is similar to that considered in @xcite ) tends to raise the critical temperature sharply with respect to the monodisperse limit @xcite .",
    "thus on increasing the degree of polydispersity at a _ given _ temperature , one can expect the interface to become sharper since the system moves deeper into the two phase region .",
    "our results provide an extreme example of this .",
    "specifically the temperature at which we studied phase coexistence in the polydisperse system , @xmath65 exceeds the corresponding critical temperature in the monodisperse limit , namely @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "thus at @xmath65 no interface would occur at all in the monodisperse limit .",
    "another issue which complicates comparison of interfacial widths for polydisperse and monodisperse system is the choice of parent density @xmath18 .",
    "owing to fractionation and the resulting smearing of the phase diagram ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) , the value of @xmath18 represents a crucial factor in determining the properties of the coexisting bulk phases and hence the interface between them .",
    "again the present work provides a case in point : although we studied the system at the critical temperature , true phase coexistence was nevertheless observable because @xmath18 was set less than its critical value .",
    "indeed one can obtain a sharper or a broader interface simply by changing @xmath18 at constant @xmath7 , a situation which contrasts with that in the monodisperse limit .",
    "thus we believe that when trying to isolate the intrinsic effect of polydispersity on interfacial widths , one should endeavor to perform the comparison at points in the phase diagram that are in some sense equivalent in terms of their relative deviation from criticality .",
    "matching the bulk volume fraction fluctuations ( in preference to the densities which do not provide equivalent information ) seems one reasonable way to do this .",
    "doing so ( cf . inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : avprofs](a ) ) shows that polydispersity may only broaden the interface marginally ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "we caution , however , that our study is far from comprehensive in this regard , and it is possible that interfacial segregation and its effect on the surface tension and interfacial width might become more significant at state points further removed from criticality @xcite .",
    "this would be an interesting avenue for further computational study ."
