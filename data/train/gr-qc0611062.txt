    "when @xmath27 , the transition probability per unit time @xmath28 vanishes , which implies that there is no excitation in an inertial detector initially prepared in its ground state @xcite .",
    "according to the above calculation of the transition probability one may expect that after the coupling is switched on , the reduced density matrix of the detector would evolve continuously from the ground state to higher excited states , with the detector finally ending up in equilibrium with a boltzmann distribution @xmath29 $ ] at the unruh temperature @xmath30 . then one can read off the unruh temperature from the late - time distribution inside the detector .",
    "in this note we use the exact solutions to an unruh - dewitt detector @xcite in uniform acceleration interacting with a quantum field to show that the above described conventional scenario is good only in the markovian regime corresponding to the limits of ultra - high acceleration or ultra - weak coupling .",
    "the transition probability calculated from the infinite - time tdpt is valid only in transient under restricted conditions .",
    "the evolution of the detector under general conditions is quite different from the above picture .",
    "the difference between this new understanding and the conventional picture originates from the fact that the full interplay between the detector and the field is included here whereas the conventional approach based on perturbation theory operative for infinite time ignores the backreactions  the use of tdpt over indefinite time amounts to invoking a markovian approximation which imposes rather severe limitations .",
    "the conventional wisdom is built upon conditions which can not reflect the most general features in the full dynamics of the detector - field system made possible here by the nonperturbative solutions .",

    "we identify the range of validity of the conventional results to that which corresponds to making a markovian approximation with its strong limitations . in sec.v",

    "this ud detector theory behaves like the quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) of a harmonic oscillator interacting with an ohmic bath provided by the 4-d scalar quantum field @xcite .",
    "the qbm model is a useful comparison because it shows clearly the dissipative and stochastic behavior of the dynamics arising from the interplay between the system and the environment , and the influence functional treatment incorporates the backreaction of the environment on the system ( which could be either the quantum field or the harmonic oscillator depending on what one is after ) in a self - consistent way . since the qbm model indicates that there are nontrivial activities at zero temperature @xcite , we caution that even for the @xmath36 case the detector is not just laying idle but has interesting physical features due to its interaction with the vacuum fluctuations in the quantum field .",
    "unruh and zurek @xcite have studied an exactly solvable qbm model where a harmonic oscillator interacts with a massless scalar field in 2-d .",
    "they derived the exact master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system ( oscillator ) at a temperature determined by the initial state of the field , and observed some general features different from the conventional markovian results ( valid for an ohmic bath at ultra - high temperature ) .",
    "one feature is the dependence of the uv cut - off in the master equation and the reduced density matrix , and thus also in the von neumann entropy of the system .",
    "when the interaction is switched on , the factors in the master equation and the entropy have initial  jolts \" over a very short time scale corresponding to the uv cut - off frequency , which cause significant change in the coherence of the quantum state of the system , while the coherence residing in each subsystem is rapidly transferred into the correlation between them .",
    "this effect is discussed in detail in @xcite .",

    "let us explore the physical meaning of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "@xmath104 is the hamiltonian for the  free \" detector so that @xmath105 is an eigenstate of @xmath104 .",

    "one can see that there exists a range of @xmath6 ( less than about @xmath109 ) where @xmath110 is smaller than @xmath111 , violating the uncertainty principle .",

    "the simplest example is the ud detector fixed at radius @xmath173 far from a schwarzschild black hole , while the scalar field is in hartle - hawking ( hh ) vacuum ( which is the counterpart of minkowski vacuum for the uniformly accelerated detector in minkowski space @xcite ) .",
    "the response function per unit time for a massless scalar field in the schwarzschild background is given by candelas ( section v in ref.@xcite ) . according to @xcite , when @xmath174 , the response function for hh vacuum is exactly the same as the one in the uniform acceleration case ( eq.(58 ) in @xcite ) with the unruh temperature @xmath175 replaced by the hawking temperature @xmath176 for the schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath177 .",
    "therefore the results in this paper can be directly applied to the case of ud detector fixed at @xmath174 outside a schwarzschild black hole by neglecting its back reaction to spacetime .",

    "for the case with the detector sitting very close to the event horizon , due to the effective potential barrier in the radial equation for the field , one has to consider the back - scattering of the retarded field induced by the detector in addition to the vacuum fluctuations described by the response function .",
