    "the stellar populations predicted by galform to form in each halo are also associated with ` tagged ' subsets of dark matter particles . by following these tagged dark matter particles ,",
    "we track the evolving _ spatial distribution and kinematics _ of their associated stars , in particular those that are stripped from satellites to build the stellar halo .",
    "this level of detail regarding the distribution of halo stars is unavailable to a standard semi - analytic approach , in which the structure of each galaxy is represented by a combination of analytic density profiles .",
    "tagging particles in this way requires the fundamental assumption that baryonic mass nowhere dominates the potential and hence does not perturb the collisionless dynamics of the dark matter .",
    "generally , a massive thin disc is expected to form at some point in the history of our ` main ' haloes .",
    "although our semi - analytic model accounts for this thin disc consistently , our dark matter tagging scheme can not represent its dynamics .",
    "for this reason , and also to avoid confusion with our accreted halo stars , we do not attempt to tag dark matter to represent stars forming in situ in a thin disc at the centre of the main halo .",
    "the approximation that the dynamics of stars can be fairly represented by tagging dark matter particles is justifiable for systems with high mass - to - light ratios such as the dwarf satellites of the milky way and m31 ( e.g. simon & geha 2007 ; walker et  al . 2009 ) , the units from which stellar haloes are assembled in our models .",
