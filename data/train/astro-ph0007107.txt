    "bl lac objects are highly variable sources characterised by non thermal emission that dominates from the radio to the @xmath0-rays . the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is dominated by two broad emission peaks : the lower frequency peak is believed to be produced by synchrotron emission , while the higher frequency peak is probably due to inverse compton process . the variability for these sources is more pronounced at higher energies and the overall sed can change drammatically during strong flare events ( e.g. mkn501 , pian et al .",

    "we report on the two _",
    "beppo_sax observations of bl lac itself , during a campaign aiming to study other bl lac objects while in a flaring state .",
    "bl lac x - ray spectrum is quite hard with an energy spectral index of @xmath1 ( sambruna et al .",
    "1999 ; madejski et al .",
    "it has already been observed by _",
    "beppo_sax , in november 1997 , with a 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath2 ( padovani et al . in preparation ) .",
    "this is comparable to the level observed by _",
    "rossi_xte during the 1997 , july outburst .",
    "beppo_sax observations were triggered by two optical flare events ( r magnitude brighter than 13 mag ) , although when the source was actually observed by _ beppo_sax the optical flux was lower ( r=13.4 - 13.6 mag ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,^ \" , ]     n@xmath3 fixed at the value @xmath4 .",
    "the two power laws cross at @xmath5 kev .",
    "on may , 1999 , bl lac was reported to be again in an optically bright state , thus we triggered our _ beppo_sax too and bllac was observed the 5 - 7 of june , 1999 .",
    "however , the source was about a factor of two weaker than the first _ beppo_sax observation .",
    "the 0.1 - 100 kev x - ray spectrum can not be fitted by a single power law .",
    "a broken power law gives a better fit with a concave shape ( see table 1 ) .",
    "for the interstellar absorption we find a value of n@xmath6 , consistent with the values found in previous works ( see sambruna et al . 1999 ; madejski et al .",
    "thus , we probably detected both the synchrotron and the inverse compton components . during this observation",
    "we also find very short time scale variability , with the * 0.1 - 10 kev flux increasing by a factor of two in about 20 minutes*. this variation was not detected in the simultaneous r band light curve .",
    "this variability is seen only in the synchrotron part of the spectrum .",
    "in fact , both the lecs and the mecs instruments detect this variability only below the break , @xmath7 kev ( see fig . 1 in tagliaferri et al",
    ". 2000a ) .",
    "this result is similar to what we observed during another _",
    "beppo_sax too observation of the bl lac object on231 ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "after the _",
    "beppo_sax observation , the source remained active in optical with the r magnitude ranging between @xmath8 mag . at the end of november",
    ", it brightened again to r@xmath9 , thus we triggered a second _ beppo_sax too observation .",
    "however , again , when the source was observed in x - ray the r magnitude was down to r@xmath10 .",
    "this time the 0.1 - 100 kev x - ray spectrum is well fitted by a single power law , with a flat energy index @xmath11 . the total flux in the 2 - 10 kev energy band is about a factor of two higher , however the two spectra cross at about 1.5 kev , thus the flux in the softer x - ray energy band is actually lower . clearly , the overall shape of the sed changed between the two observations and during the second one we detected only the compton component . during this observation we did not detect fast variability .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "1 four different seds corresponding to the multi - wavelength campaigns carried out during november 1995 , during july 1997 , when the source was in a very high state and during the two _ beppo_sax observations .",
    "this figure clearly shows the high degree of variability and complexity of the bl lac s sed .",
    "probably different emission mechanisms are working at different times . here",
    "we propose the presence of a blob moving along a jet , responsible for the ssc emission .",
    "if the moving blob is outside the broad line region ( blr ) , there will not be an extra compton component .",
    "if instead the blob is inside the blr , then there will also be external seed photons coming from the blr that can be compton scattered",
    ". these will be even more numerous if one or more clouds were inside the jet itself .",
    "the various scenarios are sketched in fig .",
