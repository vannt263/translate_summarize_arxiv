    "the mechanism by which a mixture of two or more components can spontaneously separate into distinct regions ( or phases ) with different chemical compositions and physical properties is usually named spinodal decomposition or phase separation .",
    "this phenomenon has been widely studied with phase field approach ( see for instance @xcite and reference therein ) , in that the interface between the two pure phases is not sharp and it is replaced by a narrow diffuse layer across which the fluids may mix . if we denote with @xmath0 the concentration of the components , its evolution is given by the cahn - hilliard equation : @xmath1 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath2 represents the mobility and @xmath3 is the chemical potential depending on the state variables .",
    "the phase separation can be induced by many factors .",
    "typically it takes place when the mixture is quickly cooled below a critical value of the temperature where the mixture can no longer exist in equilibrium in its homogeneous state ( @xcite ) .",
    "even the velocity can influence the miscibility properties of the mixture ( see @xcite ) .    in our paper",
    ", we suppose that the heat flux @xmath4 can induce the spinodal decomposition . indeed , an increase of @xmath4 , like as an increase in the temperature , reduce the miscibility gap .",
    "so we let the chemical potential depend on @xmath4 . in order to describe the evolution of the system , we couple the kinetic equations involving the state variables with a suitable law for the heat flux . in particular , we assume that @xmath4 obeys a ( modified ) cattaneo - maxwell equation ( see @xcite )",
    ". it plays a crucial role in proving the thermodynamically consistence of our model , which is not guaranteed with a constitutive law of fourier type .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the order parameter @xmath0 and , following @xcite , we model the system as a quasi - incompressible binary mixture . the assumption of quasi - incompressibility means that both components are incompressible with different density , but , due to variations of the order parameter , the density of the mixture is not constant and the velocity may not be non - solenoidal . in section 3",
    "we write the evolution equations for the state variable ( the order parameter , the velocity , the absolute temperature and the heat flux ) .",
    "section 4 is devoted to establish the restrictions imposed on the material parameters by the principles of thermodynamics .",
    "finally , in section 5 we prove a maximum theorem for the order parameter , so that @xmath0 is always defined into the interval @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "we consider a binary mixture of two incompressible non - reacting fluids , occupying a fixed domain @xmath6 with a smooth boundary @xmath7 . in the following",
    "the fluids are labeled by @xmath8 .",
    "each component is characterized by its own intrinsic constant density @xmath9 under standard conditions of temperature and pressure .",
    "we suppose that @xmath10 .",
    "the total mass and the density of the mixture are denoted respectively by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , namely @xmath13 let @xmath14 , @xmath15 be the masses of each species in @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 and @xmath19 the apparent densities of the two constituents , such that @xmath20 .",
    "the adjective `` apparent '' is used to emphasize that we are considering the ratio of each mass fraction over the total volume element , rather than over its own fractional volume .",
    "accordingly , the ratio @xmath21 denotes the the volume fraction of the substance @xmath22 and hence the following equality holds : @xmath23    denoting by @xmath24 the velocity of the @xmath22 fluid , the mean velocity @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26    in order to derive the diffuse interface model , we introduce an order parameter measuring the degree of phase separation , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the mass concentration of the fluid @xmath22 .",
    "the equality @xmath29 leads to @xmath30 from the definition of @xmath0 , it is apparent that @xmath31 $ ] . in particular , @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) wherever only the component @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) occurs . in contrast with two fluids models , in the diffusive approach the fundamental fields of the model are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath0 , rather than @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( see @xcite ) .    in our paper , we are interested in modeling quasi - incompressible fluids , that is we assume that both constituents are incompressible , but the density of the mixture may not be constant and change owing to variations in the concentration parameter @xmath0 .",
    "for this reason , the density @xmath12 is no more an independent variable , but it is a function of @xmath0 . in particular , and implies @xmath42 which implies @xmath43 the assumption @xmath44 assures that the density is not constant .",
    "accordingly , the velocity @xmath25 is not solenoidal and satisfies the continuity equation @xmath45 since @xmath12 is a function only of @xmath0 , @xmath46 is related to @xmath47 by the relation @xmath48 from it follows that the derivative @xmath49 is given by @xmath50^{2}}.\\ ] ]    during the process of phase separation , the two components can separate into distinct regions with different chemical compositions , but the total mass @xmath51 , @xmath52 , of the two species remain constant , that is @xmath53 equations are equivalent , in a two fluids model , to the balance of the overall mass and the balance of the order parameter @xmath54 where the vector @xmath55 is a suitable flux ( see @xcite ) satisfying the boundary condition @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the unit outward normal vector . as a consequence ,",
    "the global mass of the mixture is conserved , namely @xmath58    as customary , we regard @xmath55 as a constitutive function of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath0 ( and their gradients ) . in particular , @xmath55 is assumed to be proportional to the gradient of the generalized chemical potential @xmath59 , _ i.e. _ @xmath60 where @xmath2 denotes the diffusive mobility , which is a non - negative function eventually depending on the concentration @xmath0 , while @xmath59 is the classical chemical potential .",
