    "coefficients for lorentz violation in the standard - model extension , or sme,@xcite have been measured experimentally across the spectrum of physics.@xcite a standard sun - centered inertial reference frame with orthogonal spatial coordinates @xmath0 , and time @xmath1 , is used for reporting limits on sme coefficients.@xcite most limits on coefficients in the minimal sme , involving operators of mass dimension @xmath2 , have been expressed using the rectangular @xmath3 components . however , for tests of rotational symmetry with higher mass dimensions , a spherical decomposition of the operators is particularly useful . in the photon sector of the sme ,",
    "the spherical operators at all mass dimensions have been calculated.@xcite our goal here is to obtain limits on the @xmath4 spherical coefficients from published photon - sector limits expressed in rectangular coordinates .",
    "[ convert_table ]",
    "there are 19 independent coefficients for lorentz violation at dimension @xmath4 in the photon sector of the flat - spacetime sme . in the rectangular basis ,",
    "the usual ones are denoted by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , each with five components , @xmath8 , with three components , and @xmath9.@xcite in the spherical basis , nine of the independent coefficients are denoted @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as is conventional for angular momentum operators .",
    "the remaining ten are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for @xmath15 . only a handful of limits on @xmath4 spherical components @xmath16 exist.@xcite below",
    ", we improve on these and deduce a number of others by translation of existing results in the rectangular basis .    to translate limits from one basis to the other , the first step is to express the spherical coefficients in terms of the rectangular ones .",
    "one may start with the definitions in eq .",
    "( 7 ) of ref .  , and",
    "expand in terms of the spherical coefficients using table vii of ref .  .",
    "after applying eq .",
    "( 45 ) of ref .   to the complex - valued spherical coefficients ,",
    "several simplifications occur .",
    "the results are given in table [ convert_table ] , and show a straightforward mapping between the two sets .",
    "in each line of the table , an equal sign is understood between the spherical coefficient in the first column and the combination of rectangular ones in the second .",
    "note that , for @xmath17 , the expressions involve real and imaginary parts of the spherical coefficients .",
    "the simplicity of the results is striking , given the expectation that they might involve linear combinations of up to 19 coefficients .",
    "[ limitstable ]",
    "table [ convert_table ] shows that each limit on a @xmath4 spherical coefficient follows from multiplication of the corresponding rectangular limit by a numerical factor . in the first ten lines , the spherical coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 control",
    "birefringent effects and are constrained at extraordinary levels by astrophysical observations.@xcite    the nine @xmath10 coefficients include @xmath18 , which has been studied in a variety of contexts and limited at multiple levels in numerous ways.@xcite we focus on the eight remaining @xmath10 spherical coefficients , which have been measured in various experiments with cavity oscillators.@xcite    the limits on these spherical coefficients are presented in table [ limitstable ] , where the first column lists the spherical coefficient , the second column gives the translated limit , and the last two provide a brief description of the system and give the reference .",
    "the top portion of the table gives results for @xmath19 .",
    "two results are listed for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , since the relevant experiments have comparable sensitivities.@xcite the lower portion of table [ limitstable ] gives limits on the five @xmath15 coefficients based on recent empirical limits.@xcite    as experiments place bounds on spherical sme coefficients , these results provide a comparison point for photon - sector results that predate the development of the spherical formalism .",
    "we also note that conversions of this type are possible in other sectors of the sme , and for higher mass - dimension operators .",
