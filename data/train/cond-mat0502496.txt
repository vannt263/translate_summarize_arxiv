    "this has the effect to lower the energy dissipated in a jump , and thus the friction force .",
    "the energy barrier is given by @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are respectively the positions of a metastable minimum and maximum of @xmath168 .",
    "[ f.vfric1dv_0alleta2t0-300 ] compares the velocity dependence of the friction force for three values of @xmath173 in the stick - slip regime ( @xmath174 ev , @xmath175 ev and @xmath4 ev ) , with @xmath66 n / m ( yielding @xmath176 , @xmath62 and @xmath177 respectively ) , both for @xmath10 and @xmath160 k. at the smallest scanning velocity considered , in going from @xmath10 to @xmath160 k , @xmath2 decreases only by a factor @xmath178 for @xmath76 , but by a factor @xmath179 for @xmath176 . indeed , by increasing @xmath180 , the friction force @xmath2 , in the stick - slip regime , tends to its maximum value @xmath43 , and the relative variation in the stick - slip signal decreases . as a consequence ,",
    "the role of thermally activated processes will be less strong for large @xmath181 .",
    "moreover , the relative variation of @xmath2 with @xmath3 is much more pronounced for the lowest value of @xmath180 , and the velocity dependence of friction becomes weaker for larger @xmath180 .",
    "the slope of the curves at @xmath160 k slightly changes by increasing @xmath180 and we find that the value @xmath167 of the exponent of the logarithmic behavior ( eq .",
    "( [ e.ramplog ] ) ) is recovered for the largest @xmath180 we have used .",
    "this is in compliance with the approximation used to derive eq .",
    "( [ e.ramplog ] ) , namely @xmath77 and @xmath166 .",
    "more generally the data can be fitted by @xmath182 where the exponent @xmath183 depends on @xmath180 .",
    "in particular , from our data we obtain @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",

    "this indicates that thermal effects critically depend on the surface corrugation and on temperature .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the velocity dependence of sliding friction at the atomic scale within the framework of the tomlinson model . we have emphasized the role of the athermal processes characterizing the dynamics , which are responsible for a power - law velocity dependence of the friction force at small scanning velocities , while at finite temperature a creep regime takes place , giving rise to a logarithmic behavior of the friction force as a function of velocity . at variance with previous claims in the literature ,",
    "these dependences apply both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we have also suggested in a semi - quantitative manner in which conditions thermal effects are expected to be important for the frictional dynamics .",
    "experimentally , the possibility to observe a velocity dependent frictional force may crucially depend on the nature of the system , which determines the corrugation @xmath73 , on the stiffness of the cantilever and on the applied loading force , which in turns affects the value of @xmath73 .",
    "our model is simplified in the sense that the cantilever is treated as a point - like object and the form of energy dissipation , taken into account by introducing a damping term in the equations of motion , is purely phenomenological .",
    "of course , in real situations finite contacts between the tip and the surface are involved and energy dissipation comes into play through more complex mechanisms .",
    "however , a simple description based on the tomlinson model contains the essential ingredients of the problem and can still capture the main dynamical features determining energy dissipation .",
    "we expect our study to stimulate further theoretical and experimental work on this issue .",
