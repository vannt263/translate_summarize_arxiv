    "recent progress in vlbi observations of relativistic jets outflowing from active galactic nuclei  @xcite gives us new information concerning their physical characteristics and dynamics .",
    "in particular , rather effective deceleration of the jet material on the scale more than 50100 pc was recently detected by mojave team  @xcite .",
    "we consider one possible explanation of such a deceleration connecting with the interaction of the jet with the external photon field . both radiation drag and particle loading will be considered in detail on the ground of standard mhd approach , the first mechanism below and the second one in the accompany paper  @xcite",
    ".    remember that it is the magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) model that is now developed intensively in connection with the theory of relativistic jets outflowing from a rotating supermassive ( @xmath0 ) black holes , which are thought as a central engine in active galactic nuclei and quasars  @xcite . in particular , it is the mhd model that is now the most popular in connection with the problem of the origin and stability of jets .",
    "moreover , within last several years additional observational confirmations were found in favor of the mhd model such as the presence of the @xmath1 plasma  @xcite as well as the toroidal magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "finally , recent numerical simulations  @xcite demonstrate their very nice agreement with mhd analytical asymptotic solutions .",
    "on the other hand , the density of photons in the vicinity of the central engine is high enough .",
    "this implies that the photon field may change drastically the characteristics of the ideal mhd outflow .",
    "for example , they may result in the particle loading , i.e. , extensive @xmath1 pair creation  @xcite , their acceleration by action of the radiation drag force for small enough particle energies as well as the deceleration of high energetic particles  @xcite .",
    "in other words , in the self - consistent consideration the interaction of the magnetically dominated flow with the external photon field is to be taken into account .",
    "unfortunately , many years these two processes , i.e. , mhd acceleration and the action of external photons , was developed separately . only in the paper by",
    "@xcite the first analytical step was done to combine them together . in particular ,",
    "it was demonstrated how general equations can be integrated for conical geometry ( which is impossible in general case ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the consideration was produced in the given poloidal magnetic field .",
    "but under this assumption the fast magnetosonic surface ( for cold flow ) locates at infinity  @xcite . as a result",
    ", it was impossible to analyze the radiation drag effect in the vicinity of the fast magnetosonic surface and the properties of the supersonic flow outside this surface .    self - consistent disturbance of magnetic surfaces was included into consideration by  @xcite for high enough particle energy ( when the radiation pressure is ineffective in particle acceleration ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that for magnetically dominated flow the drag force actually does not change the particle energy diminishing only the total energy flux .",
    "it was shown as well that the disturbance of magnetic surfaces becomes large only if the drag force changes significantly the total energy flux . finally , recently  @xcite have considered the drag action on the magnetised outflow in gamma - busters where the radiation pressure can play the leading role in particle acceleration .    as to partile loading ,",
    "several aspects of this process were considered by  @xcite . even if the electron - positron pairs are created at rest ( and , hence , they do not change the total energy and angular momentum flux ) , increasing of the particle flux inevitably decreases the mean particle energy . as a result",
    ", the particle loading can be considered as a rather effective mechanism of the deceleration of the jet bulk motion as well .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to determine more carefully the photon drag action on the cylindrical magnetically dominated outflow . as a zero approximation ( i.e. , without radiation drag and particle loading )",
    "we use well - known analytical solution for cylindrical magnetically dominated mhd outflow  @xcite . as we are interesting in the region far enough from the central engine , in what follows we consider the simple isotropic model of the radiation field ( i.e. for energy density @xmath2 const ) .",
    "actually , our goal is just in evaluating @xmath3 which are necessary to explain the observable deceleration of jets on the scale @xmath4@xmath5 pc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . at first in sect .",
    "[ sub : problem ] we discuss the very necessity to use two - fluid mhd approximation for highly magnetized winds and jets in the presence of the external photon field . in sect .",
    "[ s : rd ] , starting from the basic two - fluid mhd equations we demonstrate how the drag force redistributing the electric charges results in the appearance of longitudinal electric field .",
    "it gives us the possibility to determine the change of particle energy .",
    "the beam damping resulting from particle loading is discussed in the accompany paper  @xcite . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sect : diss ] the main results of our consideration including astrophysical applications are formulated .",
    "at first , let us formulate the main unsolved problem we are going to discuss . up to now ,",
    "both analytically   and numerically  @xcite , the properties of highly magnetized winds and jets were mainly described within mhd approximation .",
    "only recently the first steps were done using pic numerical simulation  @xcite , but these explorations are still in the very beginning .",
    "it is convenient for us to introduce just now the main dimensionless parameters describing ideal mhd flow , namely , the particle multiplicity @xmath6 , the magnetization parameter @xmath7 , and the compactness parameter @xmath8 .",
    "first , to describe the flow number density one can introduce so - called particle multiplicity @xmath6 @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the  @xcite charge density , i.e. , the minimum charge density required for the screening of the longitudinal electric field in the flow .",
    "here @xmath12 is the poloidal magnetic field in a jet and @xmath13 is the central engine angular velocity .",
    "as was shown by  @xcite , for active galactic nuclei the multiplication parameter can be very large : @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "next ,  @xcite magnetization parameter @xmath7 shows by how much the electromagnetic energy flux near the central engine can exceed the particle energy flux .",
    "the value @xmath7 corresponds to the maximal bulk lorentz factor of the plasma that can be reached in the case where all the electromagnetic energy is transferred to the particle flow . in other words",
    ", @xmath7 is the maximum lorentz factor that can be achieved in the magnetized wind . for cylindrical flow under consideration",
    "one can determine @xmath7 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is its transverse dimension of a jet .",
    "the convenience of these two parameters stems from the fact that their product depends on the total energy losses @xmath18 only and , hence , can be determined from observations .",
    "indeed , as was shown by  @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 erg / s .",
    "this value corresponds to minimum energy losses of a central engine which can accelerate particles up to relativistic energies .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath21 for ordinary jets from agn .",
    "another representation of the product @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "as we see , this value corresponds to the total potential drop across the jet .    finally , the compactness parameter @xmath25 is in fact the optical depth by thomson cross section @xmath26 at a distance @xmath27 in the photon field with energy density @xmath3 .",
    "below , it will be important for us that the parameter @xmath8 provide an upper limit of particle energy in the acceleration region .",
    "on the other hand , a large @xmath8 is necessary for effective particle production .",
    "it is necessary to stress that in this paper we consider only leptonic model of the relativistic jets .",
    "for this reason we normalize all the values on electron mass @xmath28 .",
    "this approach is reasonable for very central parts of a jet connecting by magnetic field lines with the black hole horizon ( and , hence , loaded by secondary @xmath1 plasma generated by photon - photon conversion ) .",
    "it is in this region the numerical simulations mentioned above demonstrate regular magnetic field and energy flux . as to periphery part of a jet connecting with accreting disk , the special consideration including",
    "reconnection is necessary .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present consideration .",
    "returning now to one - fluid mhd approach , it is necessary to stress that it has serious restriction . indeed , well - known freezing - in condition @xmath29 results in two consequences @xmath30 namely , zero longitudinal electric field and smallness of the perpendicular electric field in comparison with magnetic one .",
    "@xcite isorotation law , i.e. , the conservation of so - called field angular velocity @xmath31 ( see below ) along magnetic tubes is the mathematical formulation of this property . as a result , very large potential difference between the center and the boundary of a jet takes place up to the very end of a flow where the jet meets the external media ( lobes in agns , hh objects in yso , stellar wind in close tev binaries ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is clearly impossible to describe the interaction of external media with highly magnetized flow without including this potential drop into consideration . indeed , neglecting @xmath32 we do not include into consideration the role of the poynting flux which is the main actor of our play . as a result , during such an interaction the domains with nonzero longitudinal electric field or with @xmath33 are to appear resulting in very effective particle acceleration  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , up to now the role of the poynting flux during the interaction with external media was considered only indirectly , say , by adding large enough toroidal magnetic field which energy density is similar to that of magnetized flow  @xcite .",
    "remember that general properties of the mhd shock containing arbitrary poynting flux were already formulated more than ten years ago  @xcite .",
    "effective particle acceleration can takes place even without external media . as was already demonstrated many years ago  @xcite , if there is some restriction on the longitudinal electric current circulating in the magnetosphere of radio pulsar , in the vicinity of the light cylinder @xmath34 the region with @xmath33 appears . as a result , in the narrow region @xmath35",
    "the very effective particle acceleration is to take place up to the bulk lorentz - factor @xmath36 .",
    "it is interesting that just such a sudden acceleration was recently supposed to explain pulse tev radiation from crab pulsar  @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent pic modelling of the axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere  @xcite also demonstrates very effective particle acceleration near the light cylinder up to @xmath37 .",
    "here it is necessary to stress one very important point . not only one - fluid , but even two - fluid mhd approximation is not sufficient to describe the interaction of the highly magnetized flow with external media . as was shown by  @xcite , effective particle acceleration in the domain with @xmath33 inevitably accompanied by vanishing of the radial velocity",
    "this implies many - fluid regime which can not be described analytically .",
    "the same concerns another dissipative processes , say , the magnetic reconnection which also discussed , mainly phenomenologically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite , in connection with the energy release in the highly magnetized flow .    in this paper",
    "we are not going to discuss the very interaction of a jet with external media , but try to evaluate the role of the external photon field in hydrodynamical retardation of a jet .",
    "in this case two - fluid approximation allows us to include into consideration self - consistently the longitudinal electric field and the disturbance of magnetic surfaces . as a result",
    ", one - fluid validity condition will be formulated .",
    "at first , let us consider interaction of the magnetically dominated jet with the isotropic photon field qualitatively . without the drag far enough from the rotation axis the particle motion along the jet corresponds to electric drift in radial electric @xmath38 and toroidal magnetic @xmath39 fields  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the drag force @xmath40 directed along the jet results in the radial drift of electrons and positrons in opposite directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) . the appropriate electric current can be evaluated as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the drift velocity .",
    "such a current is to diminish the toroidal magnetic field @xmath43 .",
    "simultaneously , redistribution of charges is to diminish the radial electric field @xmath44 .",
    "both these processes result in reducing of the poynting vector flux .    as in the magneticallym dominated jet",
    "one can write down the energy equation for the time - independent flow @xmath45 as @xmath46 using now relation ( [ newsigma ] ) and evaluations @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we finally obtain for the characteristic retardation scale @xmath49 @xmath50 the same evaluation can be directly obtained from the continuity equation @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "results in the appearance of the radial drift current , redistribution of the electric charges , diminishing of the radial electric field and , finally , damping of the poynting flux .",
    "the particle energy remains actually constant as the negative work of the drag itself actually equal to energy gain resulting from particle intersection of equi - potential surfaces . ]",
    "as we see , the work @xmath54 of the drag force @xmath55 on the scale @xmath49 ( resulting in ic photons release of the jet energy flux ) @xmath56 just equals to the particle energy corresponding to the total energy transfer from the electromagnetic poynting flux to plasma outflow  @xcite .",
    "this implies that our evaluation of the retardation scale is correct .",
    "but as this force acts actually perpendicular to the large toroidal magnetic field @xmath57 , in the first approximation the energy of particles remains constant .",
    "the point is that the energy loss @xmath58 resulting from the drag force will be fully compensated by the energy @xmath59 gaining by particles due to their radial drift motion along radial electric field .",
    "another words , the particle energy remains actually constant as the negative work of the drag itself actually equal to energy gain resulting from particle intersection of equi - potential surfaces .",
    "thus , as was firstly demonstrated by  @xcite , the drag force acting on plasma particles in the highly magnetized wind results in not the diminishing of particle energy but the diminishing of the poynting flux as both the toroidal magnetic and radial electric field decrease along the jet . as to particle deceleration , this process appears in the second order approximation when we have to include into consideration the diminishing of integrals of motion .        in this section",
    "we consider the interaction of the cylindrical magnetically dominated jet with the isotropic photon field quantitatively .",
    "to have the possibility to analyze this process analytically , some simplifications will be used . at first , as was already stressed , we discuss leptonic model of relativistic jets .",
    "second , below we consider pure cylindrical jet .",
    "this assumption is more serious than one can imagine at first glance .",
    "the point is that cylindrical geometry implies infinite curvature of the poloidal magnetic field . in this case",
    "there is well - known asymptotic behavior for particle lorentz factors in the magnetically dominated flow @xmath60 which will be used in what follows .",
    "remember that for finite curvature radius @xmath61 of the poloidal magnetic field another asymptotic solution @xmath62 is possible . as was shown by  @xcite ,",
    "see also  @xcite , under some conditions the photon drag increase the curvature radius @xmath61 resulting in bulk acceleration of plasma particles .",
    "in addition , intrinsic instabilities of cylindrical jets   also can change drastically the dynamics of interaction of photon field with magnetically dominated outflow .",
    "these processes are beyond the scope of our present consideration .    finally , in what follows we consider magnetically dominated jet , i.e. , the jet which does not reach their terminal lorentz factor @xmath63 .",
    "it is not clear that the flow remains highly magnetized up to the distances 10 - 100 pc from the central engine under consideration .",
    "nevertheless , this case is more interesting from physical point of view as it gives us the possibility to include into consideration the interaction of the photon field with poynting flux . in sect .",
    "4 some astrophysical applications connecting with fri  frii classification will be given .",
    "thus , following  @xcite , we write down the set of time - independent maxwell equations and two - fluid equations of motion for electron - positron plasma : @xmath64 here @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the charge and current densities , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the speed and momentum of particles .",
    "finally , @xmath40 is the radiation drag force . for isotropic photon field   @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the lorentz - factor of particles .    as is well - known , in the axisymmetric case",
    "one can express the electric and magnetic fields through three scalar functions , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 @xmath76 here @xmath73 is the magnetic flux , @xmath77 is the total electric current within the same magnetic tube , and @xmath78 is the so - called field angular velocity ( more exactly , the angular velocity of plasma drifting in electromagnetic fields ) .    for cylindrical outflow",
    "we have the following force - free solution of the general equations ( [ 1_1])([1_3 ] )  @xcite @xmath79 corresponding to homogeneous poloidal magnetic field @xmath80 so that @xmath81 , i.e. , it does not depend on coordinate @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 it is important that this solution can be realised by massless particles moving along the jet with the velocity equal to that of light @xmath85 moreover , this solution is true for arbitrary profile of the angular velocity @xmath78 . in particular , one can consider the most interesting case @xmath86 , when the total electric current flowing within the jet is equal to zero .",
    "for this reason , in what follows we consider @xmath87 as an arbitrary function .",
    "as previously , in the cylindrical case we seek the first - order corrections for the case @xmath88 in the following manner : @xmath89 , \\label{c_cor1}\\\\ n^{- } & = & \\frac{\\omega_0 b_0}{2\\pi c e } \\left[\\lambda + k(r_{\\perp } ) + \\eta^{-}(r_{\\perp } , z)\\right ] , \\label{c_cor2}\\\\ v_z^{\\pm } & = & c\\left[1-\\xi_z^{\\pm}(r_{\\perp } , z)\\right ] , \\\\",

    "below , for simplicity , we consider @xmath6 as a constant .",
    "besides , @xmath92 describes the charge density @xmath93 and current density @xmath94 transverse profiles .",
    "in particular , @xmath95 and @xmath96 so both the total charge and total longitudinal current in the jet vanish . finally , the disturbances of the electric potential @xmath97 and magnetic flux @xmath98 can be written as @xmath99 , \\\\",
    "\\psi(r_{\\perp},z ) & = & \\pi b_0 r_{\\perp } ^2\\left[1 + f(r_{\\perp } , z)\\right ] . \\label{c_cor3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it gives @xmath100 , \\label{c_cor6 } \\\\",

    "thus , under some conditions the electric force @xmath124 acting on the charged particle could be larger than the retardation drag force @xmath123 . in this case one of the species will be accelerated while another one will be decelerated more efficiently than by action of the drag force only resulting in full stop at some point .",

    "indeed , for large enough multiplicity @xmath171 , where @xmath172 the difference in lorentz - factors of electrons and positrons is negligible , and we deal with one - fluid mhd flow . on the other hand , for @xmath165 the drag force @xmath55 is smaller than the electrostatic one @xmath173 . as a result , as is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , one of the species accelerates while another one decelerates more efficiently than by the action of the drag force only resulting in full stop at some point .",
    "it is clear that in the last case the very hydrodynamical description it now impossible . as the condition ( [ lama ] )",

    "the corresponding poyting flux is less than @xmath177 accordingly , in the non - hydrodynamical regime the distance @xmath178 to the stop point can be evaluated as @xmath179    finally , in one - fluid approximation corresponding to condition @xmath180 we can write down @xmath181 certainly , it is possible to use this solution for small disturbance of the lorentz - factor @xmath120 only .",

    "let us try now to evaluate the real role of radiation drag in dynamics of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei .",
    "as the energy density @xmath3 at the distance @xmath27 from the central engine with the total luminosity @xmath205 can be estimated as @xmath206 erg/@xmath207 at the distance @xmath208 pc . assuming that @xmath209 erg/@xmath207 , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , one can evaluate the length of hydrodynamical retardation @xmath49 given by ( [ scale ] ) as @xmath210 thus , for @xmath211 obtained recently by  @xcite from analysis of about 100 sources using core - shift technics , the distance is quite reasonable to explain the observable retardation on the scale @xmath212 pc .    on the other hand , on the scale @xmath213 kpc , corresponding to dimension of the galaxy , where @xmath214 erg/@xmath207 , the retardation length @xmath49 is too large to prevent the jet material reaching the lobes . to conclude , in our opinion",
    ", isotropic photon field can be considered as one of the possible reason of jet deceleration in active galactic nuclei .",
    "finally , it is very interesting to discuss the photon drag action in connection with  @xcite classification . at first glance",
    ", deceleration is to be more effective in frii objects , i.e. , in objects in which the ambient radiation field is more intense . but as was demonstrated above , in objects with higher magnetization @xmath7 , the drag force acts indirectly diminishing mainly the electromagnetic flux . as far as fri sources , in which one can expect particle dominated flow in parsec scales , drag is to be much more effective .",

    ", our solution corresponds to zero ( more exactly , very small ) electric field @xmath251 along the rotational axis .    to demonstrate the very possibility for the longitudinal electric field @xmath251 to be small ,",
    "let us write down by hand the electric potential in the region @xmath252 ( and vanishing at infinity ) in the form @xmath253 where we use the expression ( [ oomeg ] ) for angular velocity @xmath31 .",
    "for @xmath254 it corresponds to electric field @xmath255 ( [ e&b ] ) for arbitrary constant @xmath256 . in particular",
    ", it gives the same zero - order charge density @xmath67 ( [ rhoe ] ) .",
    "as was already stressed , @xmath257 ( @xmath258 ) for @xmath259 , i.e. for spatially limited quadrupole charge distribution .    on the other hand , for finite @xmath49 the disturbance of charge density in the vicinity of the rotational axis for @xmath260 depends drastically on constant @xmath256 .",
    "indeed , the additional charge density can be divided into two terms , namely , the negative part @xmath261 existing for @xmath262 ( and producing electric field @xmath263 along the rotation axis opposite the particle flow ) , and the positive one @xmath264 having the same order of magnitude on the scale @xmath260 .",
    "this implies that the small redistribution of the charge density in the base of the flow indeed can screen the longitudinal electric field along the jet ."
