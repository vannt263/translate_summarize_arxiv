    "to solve the long - standing hierarchy problem , many exciting extensions of the standard model ( sm ) have been developed , such as supersymmetric models , little higgs models , extra dimension models , and etc . among these extensions , the large extra dimensions ( led )",
    "model proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali @xcite is an attractive one because it predicts possible quantum gravity effects at tev scale . in the led model",
    ", we have @xmath1-dimensional spacetime with @xmath2 being the number of extra spatial dimensions compactified on a @xmath2-dimensional torus with radius @xmath3 .",
    "the sm particles are confined on a @xmath4-dimensional brane world while the graviton can propagate in the @xmath1-dimensional bulk .",
    "the planck scale @xmath5 in the @xmath4-dimensional spacetime is related to the fundamental scale @xmath6 of the led model as @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath3 is large enough , the gravity interaction governed by @xmath6 and the gauge interaction can be unified at the tev scale , therefore , the gauge hierarchy problem is solved .    in the low - energy effective theory of the led model , the massless graviton propagating in the @xmath1-dimensional spacetime is equal to a tower of massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) states only propagating in the ordinary @xmath4-dimensional spacetime @xcite . after performing the kk reduction",
    ", we obtain the @xmath4-dimensional interactions of the sm particles with the kk gravitons .",
    "these effective couplings are heavily suppressed by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the reduced planck scale defined as @xmath10 . however , for both the virtual graviton exchange and the real graviton production , the summation over the tower of kk states cancels the dependence on @xmath9 and leads to a suppression of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the kk - graviton effects may be considerable at high energy colliders .",
    "the triple gauge boson ( tgb ) productions are of particular interest because they are sensitive to the quartic gauge couplings ( qgcs ) and thus related to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "any deviation from the sm predictions would hint at the existence of new physics .",
    "therefore , the precision studies on the tgb productions at high energy colliders within all the possible new physics models are necessary in discriminating physics beyond the sm . all the tgb productions at hadron colliders have been studied in the sm up to the qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "it is found that the nlo qcd corrections are sizable , strongly depend on the phase space and significantly exceed the expectations from a scale variation of the leading order ( lo ) result .",
    "therefore , the nlo qcd corrections should be taken into account for the tgb production phenomenological study .    the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "is expected to explore the mechanism of ewsb and new physics evidences at the tev scale , and provide more precision measurements of the qgcs than the existing data from lep ii and tevatron @xcite .",
    "compared with the thoroughly studied tgb productions at hadron colliders in the sm , only the @xmath11 processes at the lhc were studied at the lo in the framework of the led model @xcite . as the @xmath0 production",
    "is directly related to the @xmath12 qgc , the precision theoretical predictions on the @xmath0 production are needed for the measurement of the @xmath12 coupling and the search for the new physics signature in experiment .",
    "recently , the generalized effective @xmath13 approximation is applied to study the @xmath14 scattering based on the factorization @xcite . in this paper",

    "all the uv and part of the ir divergences can be removed after performing the renormalization procedure by introducing the quark wavefunction renormalization constants @xmath75 and @xmath76 which are fixed in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath77 ) renormalization scheme as @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the renormalization scale , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 refer to the uv and ir divergences regulated in the dimensional regularization scheme , respectively .",

    "the analytical expressions for the dipoles are presented in ref.@xcite .    in the numerical calculation using the subtraction scheme",
    ", we will encounter the so - called missed binning problem @xcite , because a huge positive weight from the real emission part and the corresponding huge negative weight from the subtraction term may be filled into different histogram bins . in ref.@xcite , zoltan nagy introduces a parameter @xmath100 , which decreases the size of dipole phase space , to distinct regions neighboring a singularity and regions without need of a subtraction .",
