    "the phenomenon of two - dimensional melting is one of the long - standing issues addressed by condensed matter physics . despite numerous papers publisher over the last forty years ,",
    "the mechanisms underlying the microscopic nature of melting in two dimensions ( @xmath0 ) remain unclear .",
    "in contrast to the three dimensional case , where melting develops through conventional first order transition , several microscopic scenarios have been proposed to explain microscopic @xmath0 melting .",
    "the difference between these cases deals with dramatic increase of fluctuations in @xmath0 in comparison with the @xmath1 case .",
    "landau , peierls and mermin @xcite showed that in two dimension situation the long - ranged positional order can not exist because of the thermal fluctuations , therefore the positional order transforms into the quasi - long - ranged order . on the other hand , the real long - ranged orientational order ( the order in directions of the bonds binding a particle with its neighbors )",
    "does exist in this case .",
    "currently , the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young ( bkthny ) theory of @xmath0 melting @xcite is considered the best to derscribe the phenomenon . according to this theory",
    "@xmath0 solids melt through two continuous transitions , which are activated by topological defects .",
    "for example , a disclination is an elementary topological defect in triangular lattice . in a triangular crystal lattice disclination",
    "is defined as an isolated defect having five or seven neighbours .",
    "a dislocation can be considered as a bound pair of 5- and 7-fold disclinations . in the framework of bkthny scenario , @xmath0 solids melt through dissociation of bound dislocation pairs . in this case",
    "the long - ranged orientational order transforms into quasi - long - ranged order , and the quasi - long - ranged positional order becomes short - ranged . the new intermediate phase is called a hexatic phase . in turn",
    ", the hexatic phase transforms into an isotropic liquid phase having short - ranged orientational and positional orders through unbinding dislocations ( 5 and 7-fold bound pairs ) into free disclinations .",
    "it should be noted , that the bkthny theory provides only limits of stability of the solid and hexatic phases and does not rule out that the first order liquid - solid transition can be preceded by other melting mechanisms .",
    "the bkthny theory seems universal and it can applied to describe all systems . it does not contain the interparticle potential in the explicit form , but , it contains two phenomenological parameters - the core energy of dislocation @xmath2 and frank module of hexatic phase @xmath3 - that can not be expressed explicitly in terms of the interparticle potential .",
    "later it was shown that decreasing @xmath2 can result in melting occuring through a single first - order transition resulting , for example , from forming grain boundaries @xcite or `` exploding '' 5 - 7 - 5 - 7 quartets ( bound dislocation pairs ) into free disclinations @xcite .",
    "recently the bkthny scenario was confirmed in experiments with superparamagnetic colloidal particles interacting through long - range dipolar potential @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the particles were absorbed at a liquid - air interface which restricted the out - of - plane motion .",
    "on the other hand , melting transition consistent with the bkthny scenario was found @xcite in popular experimental systems of colloidal particles confined between two glass plates @xcite . at the same time , the exsistance of the first order liquid - solid transitions @xcite and even the first - order liquid - hexatic and the first - order hexatic - solid phase transitions @xcite can be expected . in 2d superconducting vortex lattices ,",
    "macroscopic measurements provide evidence for melting close to the transition to the normal state . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors using the scanning tunnelling spectroscopy showed directly that the transition into an isotropic vortex liquid below the superconducting critical temperature does exists . before that",
    ", they found a hexatic phase , characterized by the appearance of free dislocations , and a smectic - like phase , possibly formed through partial disclination unbinding .",
    "these results confirm that the melting mechanism is not universal and it depends on interparticle interactions . at the same time the ambiguity remains even in describing the same systems such as , for example , the systems of hard disks @xcite .",
    "recently , the other melting scenario was proposed @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the bkthny theory , it was maintained that the hexatic phase does exist in the basic hard disk model , and the system melts through a continuous solid - hexatic transition but through a first - order hexatic - liquid transition @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that a first - order transition occurs between the stable hexatic phase and isotropic liquid in @xmath0 yukawa system . in paper @xcite kapfer and krauth",
    "explored behavior of a soft disk system with potential @xmath4 .",
    "the system was shown to melt in accordance with the bkthny theory for @xmath5 , while for @xmath6 the two - stage melting transition took place with continuous solid - hexatic and the first - order hexatic - liquid transition .",
    "this scenario was confirmed experimentally in a system of colloidal particles on water - decane interface @xcite . recently",
    "a paper was published @xcite where at low densities the herzian disks model was shown to demonstrate the reentering melting transition featuring the maximum on the melting line .",
    "the discontinuous liquid - hexatic transition occurs at lower than the maximum densities , while at higher densities systems melt undergoing a continuous bkt transition .",
    "it should be noted that the simulations in refs . @xcite",
    "demonstrate the very narrow hexatic phase .",
    "however , the presence of disorder can widen the hexatic phase and help study its properties .",
    "experiments usually involve two - dimensional confinement provided by slit pores having different origin or by adsorption on solid substrates .",
    "both cases can result in the frozen - in ( quenched ) disorder generated by a certain roughness .",
    "quenched disorder can change the melting scenario in @xmath0 .",
    "a disordered substrate can have a similar destructive effect on the crystalline order as temperature and can bring about melting even at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the bkthny melting scenario persists in presence of weak disorder .",
    "it is intuitively understood that the temperature of the hexatic - isotropic liquid transition @xmath7 is almost unaffected by disorder , whereas the melting temperature @xmath8 decreases drastically with increasing disorder @xcite . as a result",
    ", the stability range of the hexatic phase gets wider .",
    "these predictions were confirmed in experiment and through simulating superparamagnetic colloidal particle systems @xcite . in these experiments under gravity particles formed a monolayer at the bottom of a cylindrical glass cell having @xmath9 diameter . quenched disorder developed due to pinning a small amount of particles to the glass substrate due to van der waals interactions and chemical reactions . in our simulations we tried to find a simulation method similar to above experimental setup .    in this paper",
    "we present results of detailed computer simulation studies of @xmath0 phase diagram previously suggested core softened potential system @xcite in presence of quenched disorder for small value of the width of repulsive shoulder .",
    "the different forms of core - softened potentials are widely used for qualitative description of the anomalous water - like behavior , including density , structural and diffusion anomalies , liquid - liquid phase transitions , glass transitions , and melting maxima @xcite . in our previous publications the preliminary results on plotting phase diagrams for the system were reported @xcite .",
    "here we approached the case of the system having small repulsive shoulder .",
    "it was shown that in this case the behavior of the system potential was similar to that of a soft disks system @xcite . the random pinning results in drastic increase of the width of hexatic phase without changing the melting scenario .",
    "it gives the possibility to study some properties of the hexatic phase including calculation of the diffusion coefficient and the behavior of the orientational and translational order parameters .",
    "in the current simulations we studied a system described by potential @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 are the hard - core diameters .",
    "we simulate systems having small soft - core diameter : @xmath14 ( see fig .  [",

    "hereinafter we omitted the tildes .",
    "the study dealt with molecular dynamics simulations in @xmath18 and @xmath19 ensembles in the framework of the lammps package @xcite for the number of particles ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "we randomly choose a subset of particles at the random positions and kept them immobile for a complete simulation run @xcite in order to model a quenched disorder .",

    "the conventional first - order transition takes place without random pinning .",

    "the disorder , however , drastically changes this melting scenario .",
    "a single first - order transition is split into two transitions , one of them ( solid - hexatic ) is the continuous bkt - like transition , and the hexatic to isotropic liquid transition occurs as the first order transition in accordance with @xcite .",
    "a possible mechanism for this transition can be associated with spontaneous proliferation of grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , that melting scenario with single first - order transition corresponds to systems kept at sufficiently low temperatures . at high temperatures the repulsive shoulder of the potential becomes ineffective , and the properties of the potential will be similar to that of soft disks @xmath66 with @xmath58 . in this case",
    "we can expect finding a critical temperature ( similar to tricritical point ) above which melting should occur through two transitions in accordance with scenario proposed in ref .",
