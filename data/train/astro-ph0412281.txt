    "observational studies of star - forming regions show that young stellar objects ( ysos ) are very strong x - ray emitters .",
    "typical x - ray luminosities range from approximately 10@xmath1 to 10@xmath2ergs@xmath3 with temperatures between 10@xmath410@xmath5k ( e.g. , feigelson & montmerle 1996 ; beuther et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the earliest stage of evolution ,",
    "the protostar is still deeply embedded in its natal molecular cloud ( a@xmath6 100mag ) . as a consequence ,",
    "x - rays are not directly observable toward very young objects and the onset of the high energy radiation remains a secret to this day .",
    "molecular gas exposed to x - rays forms an x - ray dissociation region ( xdr ) with a peculiar chemistry and physical structure ( e.g. , krolik & kallman 1983 ; maloney et al .",
    "nearly all xdr models , however , concentrate on the impact of x - rays on molecular clouds or on the surroundings of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . to study the influence of x - rays on the chemistry in dense yso envelopes and find molecular tracers for high energetic photons , we have extended the chemical models of doty et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and stuber et al .",
    "( 2004a ) . to compare our model calculations to observations",
    "we have carried out a single - dish survey of molecular ions ( co@xmath0 , so@xmath0 ) and radicals ( cn , no ) toward both low - mass and high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "the challenge is , however , to distinguish between uv tracers ( see stuber et al .",
    "2004a ) and x - ray tracers , since both kinds of high - energy radiation tend to form ions and radicals .",
    "the chemical model is based on the detailed thermal and gas - phase chemistry models of doty et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , including uv radiation from the in- or outside ( stuber et al .",
    "the model assumes a given temperature and density distribution and calculates the time - dependent chemistry at a certain distance from the central source . for the chemical x - ray network",
    "we follow maloney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and yan ( 1997 ) .",
    "it contains direct x - ray ionization and dissociation of atomic and molecular species and x - ray induced reactions caused by electron impact .",
    "the main reactions of the electrons are the ionization and dissociation of h@xmath7 and the excitation of h , he and h@xmath7 .",
    "the electronically excited states of h , he and h@xmath7 decay back to the ground states by emitting uv photons .",
    "the internally generated ultraviolet photons can photoionize and photodissociate other species in the gas .",
    "these secondary processes are far more important for the chemical network than the primary interaction of the x - rays with the gas , making it more difficult to distinguish x - ray and uv - induced processes .",
    "we have applied our model to the massive star - forming region afgl 2591 and adopt the temperature and power - law density distribution proposed by van der tak et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and doty et al .",
    "the most important parameter in the chemistry and physics of xdrs is @xmath8 , the local x - ray energy deposition rate per particle ( maloney et al .",
    "since the heating rate is @xmath9proportional to this ratio , we can estimate its importance for the gas temperature .",
    "our first radial point of interest is at @xmath9200au from the central source where the density is already fairly high ( @xmath10 ) but @xmath11 is low due to absorption and geometric dilution .",
    "we can therefore neglect additional heating of the gas through x - rays and assume @xmath12 . for the x - ray spectrum",
    "we have fitted a thermal spectrum @xmath13 exp(-@xmath14 ) which is normally used to fit observed spectra toward star - forming regions .",
    "[ fig : model ] shows some model results for afgl 2591 with different x - ray luminosities for a plasma temperature of 10@xmath15k .",
    "similar to the results of stuber et al .",
    "( 2004a ) where the impact of an inner fuv field has been studied , the abundances of many ions and radicals are enhanced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the main difference between the fuv and x - ray models is that x - rays can penetrate deeper into the envelope and affect the gas - phase chemistry even at large distances from the source . whereas the fuv enhanced species cover a region of @xmath9200300au into the cloud , the enhanced region through x - rays is @xmath91100au in our models .",
    "the reason for this are the small cross - sections for x - rays , which become smaller the harder the x - ray photons .",
    "species that are enhanced by x - rays are among others ch , cn , hcn , ch@xmath7cn , so , ch@xmath0 , co@xmath0 and so@xmath0 .    ,",
    "co@xmath0 and so@xmath0 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the model without any high energy radiation .",
    "the long - dashed line is the model without x - rays but with an inner fuv field , the dashed line represents @xmath16ergs@xmath3 , the dotted line @xmath17ergs@xmath3 and the dash - dotted line @xmath18ergs@xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : model ] ]",
    "in addition to our theoretical models we are also searching for observational x - ray and fuv tracers near deeply embedded objects .",
    "we have carried out a survey of the rotational 32 transitions of cn , no , co@xmath0 and so@xmath0 toward a sample of 11 sources  both high- and low - mass  with the james clerk maxwell telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "these high - j transitions probe uniquely the dense gas close to the protostar and filter out the lower density material .",
    "cn and no are detected in all observed sources , but co@xmath0 and so@xmath0 only toward the high - mass ysos ( see also stuber et al .",
    "co@xmath0 is tentatively seen toward one low - mass source , iras 16293 .",
    "[ fig : lines ] shows the first detections of co@xmath0 and so@xmath0 toward afgl 2591 .     at 353.741ghz and so@xmath0 at 347.740ghz",
    "observed toward afgl 2591 in 2004 with the jcmt .",
    "[ fig : lines ] ]",
    "our models have shown that hydrides like ch or ch@xmath0 are enhanced due to either inner fuv fields ( stuber et al .",
    "2004a ) or due to x - ray emission from the central source ( stuber et al . , in prep . )",
    ". however , these lines are not observable with ground based telescopes and are therefore candidates for herschel - hifi observations . in order to constrain the size and geometry of the emitting region of ions like co@xmath0 or so@xmath0 the high angular resolution and sensitivity of alma are needed .",
    "it will then be possible to make precise estimates of the x - ray and fuv flux and maps will reveal whether the emission is really concentrated in the surrounding envelope or whether it is in the outflow cones or even in the protostellar disk . for example , the 0.1arcsec beam of alma represents a resolution of @xmath9200au toward afgl 2591 which should be sufficient to resolve the different regions .",
    "such observations will provide new and important information about the evolution of the surroundings of young stellar objects .",
