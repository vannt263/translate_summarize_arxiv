    "the large - scale structure of the universe is thought to be developed by the gravitational instability from the small gaussian density fluctuations . in a universe dominated by dark matter",
    ", the evolution of mass distribution is entirely governed by gravitational dynamics .",
    "while luminous objects such as the galaxies and the clusters are subsequently formed by complicated processes including gas dynamics and radiative process , the dark matter distribution is the most fundamental product in the hierarchical clustering of the cosmic structure formation . in particular ,",
    "the clustering feature of dark matter distribution is directly observed via weak gravitational lensing effect ( @xcite for review and references there in ) .",
    "thus , the statistical study of the large - scale mass distribution provides a useful cosmological tool in probing the formation mechanism of dark matter halos , as well as the observed luminous distribution .    in principle , all the statistical information of dark matter distribution is characterized by the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for mass density fluctuation and velocity fields , @xmath0 and @xmath9 . among these ,",
    "the one - point pdf for density field , @xmath2 , is one of the most fundamental statistical quantities and because of its simplicity , there has been numerous theoretical studies on its evolution from a gaussian initial condition . from the analytical study of one - point pdfs , @xcite first calculated the pdf using the zeldovich approximation . for a perturbative construction of one - point pdf ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite introduced the edgeworth expansion to derive the analytic formula for pdfs . on the other hand , based on the tree - level approximation",
    ", @xcite constructed the pdf from the generating function of the vertex function .",
    "interestingly , the vertex function in the tree - level approximation is obtained as an exact solution of the spherical collapse model .",
    "the effect of smoothing has been later incorporated into his calculation and the analytic pdf was compared with n - body simulations @xcite . following these results",
    ", @xcite proposed to use the spherical collapse model for the prediction of higher - order moments beyond the tree - level approximation .",
    "the most remarkable point in their approximation is that the leading - order prediction exactly matches the one obtained from the rigorous perturbation theory and the correction for next - to - leading order is easily computed by solving the simple spherical collapse dynamics .",
    "further , the spherical collapse approximation is recently extended to the prediction of one - point pdf ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the approximation has been tested against n - body simulations and a good agreement was found even in a non - linear regime of the density perturbation .    on the other hand , from the numerical study ,",
    "@xcite recently showed that the log - normal pdf quantitatively approximates the one - point pdf @xmath2 in the n - body simulations emerging from the gaussian initial condition , irrespective of the shape of initial power spectra .",
    "the log - normal pdf has been long known as an empirical model characterizing the n - body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the observed galaxy distribution ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , a good agreement with the log - normal model has been reported in the numerical study of weak lensing statistics @xcite , and an attempt to clarify the origin of the log - normal behavior has also made @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the log - normal pdf is obtained from a one - to - one local mapping between the gaussian and the non - linear density fields .",
    "thus , the successful fit to the n - body simulation might be interpreted to imply that the evolution of local density can be well - approximated by the one - to - one local mapping .",
    "indeed , the analytic pdf for the spherical collapse approximation can also be expressed as a one - to - one local mapping via the spherical collapse model .",
    "the above naive picture has been critically examined by @xcite evaluating the joint pdf @xmath10 , i.e. , joint probability of the local density fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the same comoving position but at the different times @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it has been found that a large amount of scatter in the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 shows up and their mean relation significantly deviates from the prediction from the one - to - one log - normal mapping . although this might not be surprising , the good agreement between the log - normal and the simulated pdfs becomes more contrived and difficult to be explained in a straight forward manner .",
    "definitely , the failure of the one - to - one local mapping somehow reflects the non - locality of the gravitational dynamics .",
    "that is , the evolution of local density can not be determined by the initial value of the local density only .",
    "rather , the local density can be expressed as multi - variate functions of local density and other local quantities such as velocity , gradient of local density , velocity - divergence and so on .",
    "furthermore , initial values of these local quantities are randomly distributed over the three - dimensional space . as a consequence ,",
    "even if the dynamics is deterministic , the relation between the evolved and the initial local density inevitably becomes stochastic . in a sense ,",
    "the situation is quite similar to the non - linear stochastic biasing of galaxies , i.e. , the statistical uncertainty between galaxies and dark matter arising from the hidden variables ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "then , taking account of this stochastic nature , the crucial issue is to construct a simple but physically plausible model of one - point pdf , at least , consistent with the n - body simulations in a qualitative manner .",
    "further , the influence of stochasticity on the evolution of local quantities should be investigated .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address these issues starting from a general theory of evolution of one - point pdf .",
    "in particular , we derive an evolution equation for the density and the velocity - divergence pdfs and consider how the stochastic nature of the local density field emerges . due to the incompleteness of the equations , any theoretical approach using",
    "the evolution equations for pdfs generally becomes intractable .",
    "however , under the _ local approximation _ that the evolution of density field ( or velocity - divergence ) is entirely determined by the local dynamics with finite degrees of freedom , we explicitly show that the analytical solution for the evolution equations is consistently constructed . based on this approximation ,",
    "the one - point pdfs for the density and the velocity - divergence are computed from the ellipsoidal collapse model , as a natural extension of the one - to - one mapping of the spherical collapse approximation .",
    "further , the stochastic nature arising from the multi - variate function of local quantities is explicitly shown evaluating the joint pdfs of the local density and/or the velocity - divergence .",
    "the influence of this effect is discussed in detail comparing with the spherical collapse approximation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : evolve_pdf ] , we consider a general framework to treat the evolution of one - point pdfs and derive the evolution equations for the eulerian and the lagrangian pdfs ( sec.[subsec : derivation_lag ] and [ subsec : derivation_eul ] ) .",
    "then , adopting the local approximation , consistent solutions for these equations are obtained ( sec.[subsec : localapprox ] ) .",
    "further , the stochastic nature of the evolution of pdfs is quantified evaluating joint pdfs ( sec.[subsec : joint pdf ] ) . as an application of these general considerations , in section [ sec : demonstration ] , we give an explicit evaluation of one - point pdfs adopting the spherical and the ellipsoidal collapse models as representative lagrangian local dynamics .",
    "the qualitative features of the results are compared with the perturbative analysis presented in appendix [ appen : perturbation ] or the previous n - body study .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusion and the discussion .",
    "throughout the paper , we treat dark matter as a pressure - less and non - relativistic fluid . assuming the homogeneous and isotropic background universe , the density field @xmath15 , the peculiar velocity field @xmath16 and the gravitational potential @xmath17 for the fluid follow the equation of continuity , the euler equation and the poisson equation as follows : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scale factor of the universe",
    ", @xmath22 denotes the expansion rate and @xmath23 is the background mass density .",
    "while we are mainly interested in characterizing the large - scale structure on the basis of statistical properties of the density field @xmath15 and the velocity field @xmath16 as described in section [ sec : intro ] , the dynamical evolution of such quantities is not solely determined locally .",
    "hence , we must introduce the other local quantities characterizing the non - local properties of gravitational evolution , e.g. , the gradient of local density @xmath24 , the velocity tensor @xmath25 , and so on .",
    "let us denote these variables by @xmath26 and define the joint pdf , @xmath27 , which gives a probability density that the quantity @xmath28 takes some values of @xmath29 at the time @xmath5 . in terms of this ,",
    "the one - point pdf of the density fluctuations @xmath30 is given as @xmath31 and similarly the one - point pdf of the dimensionless velocity divergence , @xmath32 , is @xmath33 where @xmath34 .    in general",
    ", a statistical characterization of the large - scale structure is coordinate - dependent .",
    "physically , there are at least two meaningful coordinates , i.e. , the lagrangian and the eulerian coordinates . while the eulerian coordinate is fixed on a comoving frame , the lagrangian coordinate is fixed on fluid particles and follows the motion of the fluid flow . hence ,",
    "as time goes on , high density regions in the lagrangian space occupy larger volume than those in the eulerian space .",
    "we thus consider both the lagrangian pdf @xmath35 and the eulerian pdf @xmath36 , defined in the lagrangian and the eulerian coordinates , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding expectation values , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are also introduced .    in the following subsection ,",
    "we first consider the lagrangian pdf and derive the evolution equation .",
    "then we derive the evolution equation for eulerian pdf in section [ subsec : derivation_eul ] .",
    "the evolution equations derived here are not yet closed because of the unknown functions . in section [ subsec : localapprox ]",
    "we discuss an approximate treatment using the local dynamics model , which enables us to obtain a closed form of evolution equation and to construct a consistent solution .      to derive the evolution equation for the lagrangian one - point pdf , we introduce an arbitrary function of local density , @xmath41 , and consider the evolution of its expectation value , @xmath42 evaluated in a lagrangian frame .",

    "these equations require the additional equations governing the evolution of the conditional means .",

    "similar to the bbgky hierarchy , if one derives the evolution equations for the conditional means , there appear new unknown conditional means .",
    "thus , we must further repeat the derivation of evolution equation for the new quantities . continuing this operation , one could finally obtain the infinite chain of the evolution equations , which is generally intractable .    instead of the exact analysis tackling the difficult problem ,",

    "as will be explicitly shown in the next section , for instance , if the spherical collapse model is adopted as lagrangian local dynamics , the evolution of local density is characterized by the single variable , which can be set as the linearly extrapolated density fluctuation , @xmath78 .",

    "we will see in the section [ sec : demonstration ] that the explicit evaluation of @xmath104 and @xmath71 adopting the spherical and the ellipsoidal collapse models shows several noticeable differences .",

    "the expressions for pdfs are general forms irrespective of the lagrangian local dynamics .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that if the local dynamics is characterized by more than the two initial parameters , qualitative behavior could be significantly changed from the local dynamics with single degree of freedom .",

    "further , the variety of evolved density for fixed @xmath78 suggests that a large amount of scatter will appear in the joint pdf @xmath105 and the resultant one - point pdfs @xmath122 and @xmath123 can not , in general , coincide with those obtained from the spherical collapse model .",
    "in computing the pdfs from the above local collapse models , one may practically encounter the case when the local density infinitely diverges at finite elapsed time for some regions in the initial parameter space , which has not been treated in previous section . to avoid the unphysical divergences",
    ", we must restrict the integral in the pdfs to the initial parameter space @xmath164 , in which the local density @xmath0 does not diverge .",
    "indeed , this modification slightly affects the normalization condition for both the lagrangian and the eulerian pdfs , i.e. , @xmath165 .",
    "although this does not alter any qualitative features of pdfs , we consider some modifications to keep the correct normalization and adopting this procedure in appendix [ appen : calculation_of_pdfs ] , and the results for one - point and joint pdfs are presented below .",
    "note , however , that the perturbation calculation discussed in [ subsubsec : one - point_pdfs ] is free from the serious divergences and within the perturbative treatment , one can rigorously develop the local approximation for pdfs .",
    "let us show the results of the one - point pdf .",
    "figure [ fig:1pteulpdf ] plots the one - point eulerian pdfs of the local density ( _ top _ ) and the velocity - divergence ( _ bottom _ ) evaluated at various linear fluctuation values @xmath138 . in both panels ,",
    "the thick lines represent the results obtained from the ellipsoidal collapse model with linear external tide , while the thin lines denote the pdfs from the spherical collapse models . in computing the pdfs ,",
    "the lagrangian local dynamics are numerically solved with the various initial conditions @xmath166 in the initial parameter space @xmath167 .",
    "then , weighting by the pdf of the initial parameter @xmath84 , the pdfs are constructed by binning the evolved results of the density @xmath0 and the velocity - divergence @xmath1 , together with appropriate convolution factors ( see appendix [ appen : calculation_of_pdfs ] ) .",
    "as expected , the overall behaviors of both pdfs in figure [ fig:1pteulpdf ] are qualitatively similar , irrespective of the lagrangian local models . as increasing the linear fluctuation value @xmath138 , while the density pdf @xmath122 extends over the high - density region @xmath168 ,",
    "the velocity - divergence pdf @xmath123 is negatively skewed and it extends over the negative region @xmath169 . in looking at the differences in each local model ,",
    "we readily observe several remarkable features .",
    "first , the density pdfs computed from both the spherical and the ellipsoidal collapse models almost agree with each other . at first glance , this seems to contradict with a naive expectation from the local dynamics in figure [ fig : evolve ] .",
    "however , one might rather suspect that the agreement in density pdfs is accidental , due to the distribution of initial parameters @xmath151 , which is , at least , consistent with a naive picture that joint pdf @xmath105 from the ellipsoidal collapse model exhibits a large mount scatter and the mean relation between @xmath0 and @xmath7 significantly deviates from one - to - one mapping of spherical collapse model ( see sec.[subsubsec : joint_pdfs ] and fig.[fig : jointpdf ] ) . on the other hand , the velocity - divergence pdfs from the ellipsoidal collapse model exhibit longer",
    "non - gaussian tails , compared with those obtained from the spherical collapse model .",
    "the deviation between both models in pdf @xmath123 becomes significant as increasing the value @xmath138 .",
    "interestingly , in the non - linear regime @xmath170 , tails of pdf @xmath123 from the spherical collapse model show the opposite tendency , i.e. , the amplitude decreases as increasing @xmath138 .    in order to characterize the qualitative behaviors more explicitly , we perturbatively solve the evolution equations for both the spherical and the ellipsoidal collapse models .",
    "the differences are then quantified evaluating the higher order moments of one - point statistics for the local density and velocity - divergence . in appendix",
    "[ appen : perturbation ] , based on the formal solution of pdfs in section [ subsec : localapprox ] , perturbative calculations of local collapse models are briefly summarized and the solutions up to the fifth order are presented .",
    "the resultant expressions for the higher order moments of density and velocity - divergence are obtained as a series expansion of linear variance @xmath171 , up to the two - loop order for the variance and the one - loop order for the skewness and the kurtosis : @xmath172 for the local density and @xmath173 for the velocity - divergence .",
    "then , all the coefficients in the above expansions yield the rigorous fractional number and table [ tbl : loop_correction ] displays a summary of the results .",
    "the calculation in spherical collapse model essentially reproduces the non - smoothing results obtained by @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the discrepancy has appeared in the higher order correction of velocity - divergence ( c.f . ,",
    "eq.[12 ] with @xmath174 of * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps , in computing the velocity - divergence moments , @xcite incorrectly used the cumulant expansion formula for @xmath0 listed in @xcite .",
    "further , we suspect that they erroneously replaced the convolution factor @xmath93 in eulerian expectation value with @xmath175 . on the other hand , in our calculation",
    ", moments @xmath176 are rigorously computed according to the definition ( [ eq : moment_theta ] ) , with a help of the velocity - divergence pdf ( [ eulpdftheta ] ) with equation ( [ eq : function_h ] ) .",
    "hence , the present calculation is at least consistent with the local approximation in section [ subsec : localapprox ] and we believe that no serious error has appeared in present result .    apart from this discrepancy , one finds that the leading - order ( tree - level ) calculation of skewness @xmath177 and kurtosis @xmath178 in both models exactly coincides with each other . while the differences in the higher order correction for local density are basically small , consistent with figure [ fig:1pteulpdf ] , the results in velocity - divergence exhibit a large difference , especially in the variance @xmath179 .",
    "figure [ fig : momentdelta ] summarizes the departure from the leading - order perturbations for the variance(_top _ ) , the skewness(_middle _ ) and the kurtosis(_bottom _ ) , each of which is normalized by the leading term .",
    "clearly , the higher order corrections for variance @xmath179 show the significant difference between the spherical and the ellipsoidal collapse models , although the model dependence of the external tide in ellipsoidal collapse is rather small .",
    "remarkably , the one - loop correction @xmath180 is negative in the spherical collapse model and thereby the quantity @xmath181 does not monotonically increase .",
    "this behavior indeed matches with the non - monotonic behavior of velocity - divergence pdf seen in figure [ fig:1pteulpdf ] . in this sense ,",
    "the perturbation results successfully explain the numerical results of pdf .",
    "this fact further indicates that in a gaussian initial condition , the influence of non - sphericity or effect of shear could be negligible in the one - point statistics of local density , while it alters the shape of the pdf @xmath123 , which might be a natural outcome of the multivariate local approximation .",
    "next we focus on the joint pdfs .",
    "left panel of figure [ fig : jointpdf ] shows the lagrangian joint pdf @xmath182 from the ellipsoidal collapse model , evaluated at the present time @xmath183 with various linear variances @xmath138 . on the other hand",
    ", right panel of figure [ fig : jointpdf ] represents the results fixing the linear fluctuation value to @xmath184 at present , but at different output times . although figure [ fig : jointpdf ] does not rigorously correspond to the n - body results obtained by @xcite ( c.f .",
    "fig.7 in their paper ) , the qualitatively similar features can be drawn in several points .",
    "first , the scatter between @xmath185 and @xmath186 becomes broader as increasing the time and the linear variance ( _ top _ to _ bottom _ in left panel ) .",
    "second , the nonlinearity between the initial and the evolved density indicated from the curvature of the conditional mean @xmath187_{\\delta(z=9)}$ ] ( _ solid _ ) also tends to increase as time elapses ( _ top _ to _ bottom _ in right panel ) .",
    "the one - to - one mapping obtained from the spherical collapse model ( _ short - dashed _ ) is very different from the mean relation @xmath187_{\\delta(z=9)}$ ] , but their mean relations basically reflect the qualitative behavior of local dynamics in figure [ fig : evolve ] .",
    "that is , the evolved results of local density in the ellipsoidal collapse tends to take a larger value than that in the spherical collapse .",
    "moreover , recall the fact that both the initial and the final pdfs of local density @xmath122 show a good agreement between the spherical and the ellipsoidal collapse model ( see fig.[fig:1pteulpdf ] ) .",
    "this is indeed the same situation as in the n - body simulation ; apart from the detailed differences , a simple model of pdfs provides an essential ingredient for the stochastic nature of n - body results . in this sense",
    ", the local approximation with ellipsoidal collapse models can be regarded as a consistent and physical model of one - point statistics , which successfully explains the n - body simulations .    finally , using the ellipsoidal collapse model with linear external tide",
    ", we examine the eulerian joint pdf of local density and velocity - divergence evaluated at the same time , i.e. , @xmath124 . in figure",
    "[ fig : thetadelta ] , contour plots of joint pdf @xmath124 for various linear fluctuation values @xmath138 are depicted as function of @xmath188 and @xmath0 .",
    "this is the so - called _ density - velocity relation _ , which might be of observational interest in measuring the density parameter @xmath189 from the velocity - density comparison through the potent analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . along the line of this",
    ", theoretical works based on the eulerian perturbation theory have attracted much attention , as well as the n - body study ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the solution of the local approximation ( [ pdfdeltatheta ] ) , one can easily calculate the perturbation series of velocity - density relation @xmath100_{\\delta}$ ] as function of local density and density - velocity relation @xmath190_{\\theta}$ ] as function of velocity - divergence , the leading - order results of which are expected to coincide with previous early works in the non - smoothing case , exactly . beyond the perturbation analysis , figure [ fig : thetadelta ] reveals the general trend of the stochastic nature in the velocity - density relation . as increasing @xmath138 ,",
    "the scatter becomes much broader and the conditional means @xmath190_{\\theta}$ ] ( _ dot - dashed _ ) and @xmath100_{\\delta}$](_solid _ ) does not coincide with each other .",
    "of course , the one - to - one mapping obtained from the spherical collapse model ( _ short - dashed _ ) fails to match the both conditional means .",
    "these qualitative behavior is in fact consistent with the n - body results by @xcite and the present model provides a simple way to derive the non - linear and stochastic velocity - density relation .",
    "in this paper , starting from a general theory of evolution of one - point pdfs , we derived the evolution equations for pdf and within a local approximation , consistent formal solutions of pdf are constructed in both the lagrangian and the eulerian frames ( see eqs.[[lagpdfdelta]][[lagpdftheta ] ] for lagrangian pdfs and eqs.[[eulpdfdelta]][[eulpdftheta ] ] with eqs.[[eq : function_g]][[eq : function_h ] ] for eulerian pdfs ) . in order to reveal the stochastic nature arising from the multivariate lagrangian dynamics , we further consider the eulerian joint pdf @xmath103 ( eq.[[pdfdeltatheta ] ] ) and the lagrangian joint pdf @xmath105 ( eq.[[jointpdf ] ] ) .",
    "then , adopting the spherical and the ellipsoidal collapse models as representative lagrangian local dynamics , we explicitly evaluate the eulerian pdfs , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , as well as the joint pdfs .",
    "the results from the ellipsoidal collapse model show several distinct properties . while the pdf @xmath122 almost coincides with the one - to - one mapping of the spherical collapse model , the tails of velocity - divergence pdf @xmath123 largely deviate from those obtained from the spherical model .",
    "these behaviors have also been confirmed from the perturbative analysis of higher order moments . on the other hand ,",
    "evaluating the lagrangian joint pdf of local density , @xmath105 , a large scatter in the relation between the initial and the evolved density fields was found and their mean relation fails to match the one - to - one mapping of spherical collapse model .",
    "this remarkably reproduces the same situation in the n - body simulation .",
    "therefore , the local approximation with ellipsoidal collapse model provides a simple and physically reasonable model of one - point statistics , consistent with the leading - order results of _ exact _ perturbation theory .",
    "since the present formalism described in section [ sec : evolve_pdf ] is quite general , the approach does not restrict its applicability to the pressure - less cosmological fluid .",
    "rather , one may apply to the various fluid systems in presence or absence of gravity .",
    "as mentioned in section [ subsec : localapprox ] , however , the applicability or the validity of local approximation of pdfs , in principle , sensitively depends on the choice of lagrangian local dynamics . in the last section ,",
    "simple and intuitive examples were examined for the illustrative purposes .",
    "the results indicate that the multivariate lagrangian dynamics rather than the local model with a single variable can describe various statistical features of fluid evolution including the stochastic nature .",
    "perhaps , a straightforward extension of the present treatment is to include the effect of redshift - space distortion or projection effect , which is practically important for proper comparison with observation . before addressing this issue , however ,",
    "remember the most primarily importance of the smoothing effect . while the appropriate prescription for top - hat smoothing filter does exist in the local approximation with the spherical collapse model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the smoothing effect on the approximation using ellipsoidal collapse model still needs to be investigated .",
    "this step is in particular a crucial task in order to construct a more physical prescription for one - point statistics of cosmic fields and the analysis is now in progress .",
    "the results will be presented elsewhere ( ohta , kayo & taruya , in preparation ) .",
    "we are grateful to y.suto for reading the manuscript and comments .",
    "i.k acknowledges the support by takenaka - ikueikai fellowship . this work is supported in part by the grand - in - aid for scientific research of japan society for promotion of science ( no.@xmath191 )",
    "in computing the pdfs from the local approximation with the spherical or the ellipsoidal collapse model , one may practically encounter the case when the evolved density at a finite elapsed time infinitely diverges for some regions in initial parameter space . to avoid the unphysical divergences , we restrict the integral over the entire initial parameter space appearing in the pdfs to some regions @xmath164 , in which the local density @xmath0 does not diverge .",
    "this modification slightly alters the normalization condition for both the lagrangian and the eulerian pdfs in section [ subsec : localapprox ] and [ subsec : joint pdf ] , which should be corrected in the following re - normalization procedure .",
    "first of all , the initial distribution function @xmath84 should be re - normalized as @xmath192 then , the modification of lagrangian pdfs is to replace the initial distribution @xmath84 with @xmath193 , together with the change of the integral region .",
    "for example , the one - pint pdf @xmath194 in equation ( [ lagpdfdelta ] ) is modified as follows : @xmath195 on the other hand , for the eulerian pdfs , notice the fact that the re - normalization ( [ eq : renorm_probi ] ) also affects the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath85 ( see eq.[[eq : function_g ] ] ) , which must be modified as @xmath196 using this relation , the renormalized one - point pdfs ( [ eulpdfdelta ] ) and ( [ eulpdftheta ] ) respectively become @xmath197 for the pdf @xmath122 and @xmath198 for the pdf @xmath123 . here",
    "the variable @xmath199 is given by @xmath200 under the approximation that the time evolution of @xmath167 is neglected , @xmath201 .",
    "similarly , the renormalized eulerian joint pdf @xmath202 corresponding to the expression ( [ pdfdeltatheta ] ) becomes @xmath203",
    "in this appendix , based on the local approximation with spherical and ellipsoidal collapse models , we briefly summarize the essence of the perturbation analysis for higher order moments of local density and velocity - divergence .",
    "the details of the calculation procedure including the effect of smoothing will be presented elsewhere ( ohta , kayo & taruya , in preparation ) . here , we only present the results in non - smoothing case .",
    "let us write down the evolution equation for ellipsoidal collapse model .",
    "in an einstein - de sitter universe , equation ( [ ellipaxis ] ) becomes @xmath204 in this case , the linear growth rate @xmath159 is proportional to the scale factor @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the half length of principal axis @xmath140 can be expanded by a power series of @xmath21 : @xmath205 note that the initial conditions ( [ eq : init_con(1 ) ] ) and ( [ eq : init_con(2 ) ] ) state @xmath206 .",
    "hence , substituting the expression ( [ eq : expanded_alpha ] ) into ( [ eq : evolve_ellipsoid ] ) and solving the evolution equation perturbatively , the coefficient @xmath207 is systematically determined order by order and is expressed as the function of @xmath148 .",
    "thus , the perturbative expansion of local density @xmath0 given by ( [ eq : delta_ellipsoid ] ) is also expressed in terms of @xmath148 : @xmath208 with the corresponding boundary condition being @xmath209 .",
    "provided the function @xmath210 , one can calculate the @xmath211-th order moments of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as well as the normalization factor @xmath212 , according to the one - point pdfs of local approximation , ( [ eulpdfdelta ] ) and ( [ eulpdftheta ] ) : @xmath213^n}{n_e\\{1+f(\\lambda_i)\\ } } { p_{\\scriptscriptstyle i}}(\\lambda_i ) , \\label{eq : moment_delta } \\\\",

    "below , we separately present the perturbation results in each model .",
