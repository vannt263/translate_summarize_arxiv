    "a large set of observational ( e.g.  schweizer 1998 , struck  2005 , rothberg & joseph 2004 , 2006 ) and theoretical ( e.g. barnes 1998 , burkert & naab 2003 , naab , jesseit & burkert  2006 ) evidence shows that elliptical galaxies are consistent with the picture of being formed by mergers of spiral galaxies ( toomre 1977 ) .",
    "however , some matters are still open to discussion , such as the problem of stellar ages and metallicities ( e.g. peebles  2002 , renzini  2006 , naab & ostriker  2007 ) .",
    "observationally , one global scaling relation displayed by ellipticals is the fundamental plane ( fp ; djorgovski & davis 1987 , dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) , a linear - log relation among the effective radius @xmath15 , the central stellar 1-dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath16 , and the mean effective surface brightness @xmath17 : @xmath18 .",
    "values of @xmath19 and @xmath12 depend on several factors among the most important are : ( i ) the observed wavelength , ( ii ) the fitting method , ( iii ) the assumed underlying light profile in early - type galaxies and , ( iv ) the width and brightness of the magnitude range of the sample [ e.g. jrgensen , franz & kjaergaard 1996 , pahre et al . 1998 , mobasher et .",

    "if structural and kinematical homology is assumed , as well as a constant mass - to - light ratio , direct application of the physical virial theorem to observational related quantities leads to a fp with coefficients @xmath22 .",
    "the discrepancy of these values with the observed ones is usually termed as the `` tilt '' of the fp ; see also ( [ eq : fplane2 ] ) .",
    "the overall features of the observed fp are reproduced by merger studies [ e.g. gonzlez - garca & van albada 2003 , aceves & velzquez 2005 ( av05 ) , boylan - kolchin et al .",

    "it is likely that a combination of broken structural and dynamical homology and stellar population effects , along with a variation of the central mass - to - light ratio , may lead to the explanation of the tilt ( e.g. scodeggio et al .",

    "the study of la barbera et al .",
    "( 2008 ) points in the direction that the tilt of the fp is not driven by stellar populations but from other processes like a homology breaking .",
    "they derive tight values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 from a large sample of early - type galaxies by combining sdss and ukidss data in the optical and nir . however , donofrio et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find larger variances of the distributions of the fp coefficients as derived from a sample of three larger surveys ( wings , nfps and sdss ) suggesting that a such wide range of values for @xmath19 and @xmath12 seems to be in contradiction with the idea of a universal fp relation and speculate that the fp corresponds to a bent surface .",
    "the importance of dissipative processes in the merger hypothesis was early recognized from estimates of the central physical phase - space density of ellipticals , that turned out to be higher than that of spirals ( e.g. ostriker 1980 , carlberg 1986 , gunn  1987 , lake  1989 , kormendy  1989 ) . in a dissipationless scenario of galaxy merging , liouville s theorem ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 )",
    "demands that the central physical phase - space density remains constant so , given the previous observational estimates , it prohibits a dissipationless picture of merging disk galaxies to form ellipticals .",
    "robertson  et  al .  ( 2006 ) using a large set of simulations of equal - mass mergers without and with a gas component , and other physical processes , conclude that the fp in the @xmath7  band ( pahre et  al .",
    "1998 ) and the effective radius  stellar mass scaling relation [ @xmath15-@xmath25 ; shen  et  al . 2003",
    "( s03 ) ] can be only reproduced by mergers of disk galaxies with a gas fraction @xmath26% with respect to the mass of the disk component , @xmath27 ; ruling out dissipationless mergers as mechanism to produce these two global scaling relations .",
    "cox et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) also find that @xmath28 is of the same order to reproduce the kinematic properties of ellipticals .",
    "obtaining higher central phase densities in models of elliptical galaxy formation can be achieved , aside of taking into account dissipational processes , by including a bulge - like component in the progenitors ( e.g. vedel & sommer - larsen  1990 , hernquist , spergel & heyl 1993 ; hereafter hsh ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with several @xmath2-body simulations that have found that mergers of pure disk galaxies , residing inside dark halos with a core - like profile , are not able to reproduce the surface brightness density profiles typically found in ellipticals ( e.g. garca - gonzlez & balcells 2005 , naab & trujillo 2006 ) .",
    "the combination of arguments based on the non - reproducibility of the fp , the estimates of phase - space densities and the density profiles obtained from diverse @xmath2-body simulations have lead to the idea that collisionless models of disk galaxies , with or without a bulge , are ruled out as viable progenitors to form ellipticals ( e.g. carlberg 1986 , hsh , mao & mo 1998 , r06 , oorbe et al .",
    "2006 , robertson et al .",
    "nonetheless , there are results of @xmath2-body mergers of pure disk galaxies residing in cuspy dark halos that lead to density profiles consistent with those of early - type galaxies ( aceves , velzquez & cruz 2006 : avc06 ) and are able to reproduce adequately the fundamental plane scaling relation ( av05 ) .",
    "our results of dissipationless mergers ( see below ) suggest that they can not be ruled out on the basis of scaling arguments .    on the relevance of a bulge - like component in progenitors of merger remnants ,",
    "there is observational evidence that an important fraction of spirals do not harbor a bulge - like structure , or that it does not have a significant contribution , as is the case of late type morphological hubble types usually called `` flat galaxies '' ( e.g. goad & roberts 1981 , karachentsev 1989 , kautsch et  al . 2006 , domnguez - palmero et al . 2008 ) .",
    "according to the sample considered by kautsch et  al .",
    "about one third of spirals are flat galaxies or simple disks , and in the sample of domnguez - palmero et  al .",
    "about 30% ( 54 ) harbor a bulge and about 70% ( 137 ) have no measurable bulge .",
    "thus , these flat galaxies arise the immediate issue about to what extent @xmath2-body simulations are able to establish global scaling relations like the fp when merging .    undoubtedly , an important test on the details of the merger hypothesis is imposed by the phase - space constraints . a comparison among theoretical models of the central physical phase - space density , @xmath29 , using different models and initial conditions , although important for our understanding of the structure of remnants , needs to be related to observations in order to determine their relevance .",
    "different works have already shown that @xmath29 increases with the inclusion of a dissipative process ( e.g. r06 ) or a bulge inside a core - like halo ( e.g. naab & trujillo 2006 ) . however , given that the physical central phase - space density , @xmath29 , can not be determined observationally an estimator has to be used when comparing with observations .",
    "an early estimator was the core coarse - grained phase - space density , @xmath30 , proposed by carlberg ( 1986 ) .",
    "however , hsh considered that a more robust one is the _ effective _ coarse - grained phase - space density , @xmath14 .",
    "a strong dependency of @xmath14 with the luminosity , @xmath13 , of ellipticals has been found in several works ( e.g. carlberg 1986 , lake 1989 , hsh , mao & mo 1998 ) .",
    "for example , using data of bender , burstein & faber ( 1992 ) , hsh found that @xmath31 for the compact , intermediate and giant ellipticals with a rms scatter of 0.15  mag ; with @xmath32 being the total luminosity in the @xmath33-band .",
    "the fp and @xmath13@xmath14 scaling relations appear to be tight enough to serve as constraints for the formation scenario of elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , it should be said that up to now there is no direct comparison of the @xmath13@xmath34 scaling relation obtained from observations with its counterpart provided by the remnants of merger simulations .",
    "previous works ( e.g. hsh , r06 ) have computed only the physical cumulative coarse - grained distribution function , @xmath35 , which is compared with a model of an elliptical galaxy or either with the effect of introducing a bulge and/or gas component in the progenitors , but it has not been related with an observational quantity .    by restricting the comparison of our numerical remnants with infrared observations , for which stellar population age effects are minimum ( e.g. bruzual & charlot 2003 ) , and by adopting a procedure similar to the one used in observational studies , we examine to what extent @xmath2-body numerical simulations of spiral - like galaxy mergers , with or without a bulge - like component , are able to reproduce the observed @xmath13@xmath14 , the fp and the @xmath36@xmath25 global relations .",
    "the latter two results are compared with those obtained in our earlier works ( av05 , avc06 ) where the progenitor galaxies lacked a bulge component and with recent results from other authors .",
    "it is important to mention that we do not attempt to determine the `` zero - point '' of the above scaling relations since this surely requires to include more physical processes , such as star formation , cooling , and feedback among others ; a matter that is out of the scope of the present work .",

    "as mentioned earlier , the observed tilt @xmath60 is well reproduced in our dissipationless simulations .",
    "the reason for this agreement , although the @xmath12 index is rather poorly matched ( see table 3 ) , might be related to correlations present among the variables ( and their errors ) involved in the fitting of the fp .",
    "such correlations will affect the fitting parameters depending on how the fp is fitted , either as in equation ( [ eq : fplane ] ) or in ( [ eq : fplane2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is not clear the origin of the difference between our fitted values of @xmath19 and @xmath12 of the fp and those derived by robertson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for their equal - mass dissipationless simulations . for instance , when we use the half - projected stellar mass radius , @xmath199 , and the @xmath200-d velocity dispersion , @xmath43 , inside this radius we obtain a value of @xmath201 that tends to the expected virial value as in r06 .",
    "however , even in this case our value for @xmath202 is far from unity ( see table  3 ) .",
    "the tilt @xmath203 in this case tends to increase a little but still it is not unity .    given our results , the fp appears to arise mainly from broken structural and dynamical homology between the observed ( luminous component ) quantities @xmath204 and their theoretical counterparts @xmath205 ; where @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 is the total bound mass of the system . here",
    "@xmath209 is the total kinetic energy of the system , with contributions from rotational and thermal motion in remnants .",
    "an indication of the previous was presented in aceves & velzquez ( 2005b ) .",
    "variations in the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath168 , can be responsible for some of the tilt in the fp , especially if we focus on the value of the @xmath12 index for our remnants .",
    "however , the effect of @xmath168 would tend , according to our results , to diminish when the @xmath60 parameter is used as an indicator of the fp tilt .",
    "the @xmath13@xmath14 scalings shown in figure  2 are in the same direction as the preceding results on the fp , suggesting that the establishment of this scaling relation is consistent with a dissipationless merging scenario .",
    "it is likely that dissipative processes ( e.g. star formation and feedback ) will play a major role in defining the zero - point of all these scaling relations , and affect the indices in a not simple way .    from energy arguments in a dissipationless scenario , and assuming equal mass galaxies , hernquist et al .",
    "( 1993 ) derived the particular relation @xmath210 .",
    "when non - identical progenitors are taken into account these energy arguments predict a shallower log - slope ; for example , for a mass ratio of about @xmath211 it leads to @xmath212 .",
    "so , according to these energy arguments we should expect a range of values in the interval @xmath213 for the non - equal mass ratios considered here .",
    "thus , the theoretical expectation on the basis of these energy arguments is about @xmath214% lower than the average value ( @xmath215 ) for our no - bulge equal - mass mergers . meanwhile these theoretical values are more closer to the ones of our remnants from bulgeless progenitors .",
    "the average result from all of our mergers yield an index @xmath216 that is in good agreement with the observed nir value @xmath217 .",
    "this agreement spans for about four magnitudes and compromises remnants that can be cataloged from bright dwarf ellipticals to intermediate early - type galaxies ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "it should be noticed that differences arise when a primordial bulge is considered or not , and merger remnants from bulgeless progenitors tend to produce a scaling more close to the nir one . in general , for larger `` luminosity ''",
    "the effective phase - space density tends to a higher value for remnants with progenitors having a bulge as is found in other works that quantify the physical distribution function @xmath29 ( e.g. hsh , naab & trujillo 2006 , robertson et al .",
    "2006 ) . at low `` luminosity '' the behavior of @xmath14",
    "does not show a clear difference for bulge or bulgeless progenitors .",
    "a physical explanation for the details of the behavior of @xmath13@xmath218 ( or it physical counterpart ) is non - existent at the moment , although the arguments of hsh yield light on the subject . on other hand , unfortunately , the more extended study carried out by r06 did not address the @xmath13@xmath219 scaling relation to compare directly with our @xmath2-body results .    in summary ,",
    "the observed @xmath60-tilt of the fp and the @xmath62index of the luminosity - phase space relation , both in the nir , are consistent with those obtained here through dissipationless merger simulations ; at least over the luminous mass range covered by our remnants .",
    "we ascribe such concordance to the use of progenitors constructed under a cosmological motivated model of galaxy formation , with a nfw dark halo and satisfying initially a tully - fisher relation .    as a concluding remark ,",
    "given the results of this work , we would like to point out that trying to deduce the amount of primordial gas ( @xmath220 ) in models of progenitors , taking part in merger events , to satisfy a global scaling relation like the fp , might be subject to a non - negligible uncertainty .",
    "it is likely that the zero - point of the scaling relations would be a better constraint to the dissipational component of disk galaxy progenitors . in our opinion",
    "this is a subject that requires further work , but it is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "this research was funded by unam - papiit research project in121406 , and conacyt project 25030 .",
    "the simulations presented here were run on kan balam of dgsca - departamento de supercmputo of the universidad nacional autnoma de mxico , and in the centro nacional de supercmputo de san luis potos ."
