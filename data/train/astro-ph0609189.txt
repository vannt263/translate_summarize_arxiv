    "the cryogenic dark matter search ( cdms ) experiment is designed to search for cold dark matter in form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "these hypothetical thermal relics of the big bang are expected to have masses and annihilation cross sections at the weak scale if their relic density is around around @xmath1=0.2 .",
    "examples are the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp , or neutralino ) and the lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) in theories with large universal extra dimensions .    in cdms , wimps can be detected via their elastic scattering with ge or si nuclei .",
    "events with nuclear recoil energies of a few tens of kev and rates below 1  event kg@xmath2d@xmath2 are expected .",
    "the experiment is operated at the soudan underground laboratory in minnesota ( at 2080 m.w.e . ) , in a dedicated low - background facility . at its core",
    "are thirty z - dependent ionization- and phonon - mediated ( zip ) detectors , arranged in 5 towers . within one tower",
    "the zips are stacked 2 mm apart , with no intervening material .",
    "such close packing shields the crystals against surface low - energy electrons , and allows to identify multiply scattered events . a particle interaction in a zip detector deposits energy into the crystal via lattice vibrations , or phonons , and via charge excitations , or electron - hole pairs .",
    "the simultaneous measurement of both phonon and ionization signals allows to accurately measure the recoil energy , and to distinguish between nuclear- and electron recoil events .",
    "this distinction becomes possible since nuclear recoils produce fewer charge pairs than electron recoils of the same energy .",
    "the ionization yield , defined as the ratio of ionization to full recoil energy , is unity for electron recoils with complete charge collection , and @xmath00.3 ( @xmath00.25 ) for nuclear recoils in ge ( si ) with recoil energies above 20kev .",
    "zip detectors measure the athermal phonos created in a particle interaction using quasiparticle - assisted electrothermal - feedback transition - edge sensors ( qets ) photolitographically patterned onto one of the crystal surfaces .",
    "the qets , which are made of 1@xmath3 m wide strips of tungsten connected to eight superconducting aluminum fins are divided into four independent channels , each consisting of 1036 qets operated in parallel .",
    "the narrow tunsten strips form the transition - edge sensors ( tess ) , which are voltage biased and kept stably within their superconducting to normal transition by electrothermal feedback based on joule self - heating .",
    "energy deposited in the tungsten electron system raises the temperature of the film , increasing its resistance .",
    "the corresponding change in current is detected by a high - bandwidth squid array .",
    "the phonon pulse rise times are sensitive to the phonon arrival times at each of the four quadrants and allow to localize an event in the x - y plane .",
    "in addition , events occurring near the detector s surface display faster rise times than bulk events , allowing for a fiducial volume cut . for the ionization measurement , a drift field of a few v / cm",
    "is applied across the crystal using electrodes deposited on the two faces of each detector .",
    "the electrodes are segmented radially , in an outer annular guard ring and a central disk - shaped volume , a design optimized to veto events near the edge of the crystals .",
    "a detailed description of the cdms apparatus and shield is given in @xcite .",
    "the most recent cdms data were collected between march and august 2004 with two towers ( 6 ge and 6 si zips ) for a total of 74.5 live days yielding an exposure of 34kgd in ge and 12kgd in si in the 10 - 100kev nuclear recoil energy range @xcite . to avoid bias ,",
    "the analysis was perfomed blind , whereby events in and near the signal region were masked in the wimp search data sets .",
    "the cuts defining a signal were determined using calibration data from @xmath4ba and @xmath5cf sources and from non - masked wimp search data .",
    "the calibrations were also used to monitor detector stability and to characterize detector performance .",
    "one si detector had a known @xmath6c contamination , while one si and one ge detector showed a poor phonon sensor performance .",
    "the reported results are thus from 5 ge and 4 si zips , chosen before unmasking the wimp signal region @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria for signal events are based on quantities from the phonon and ionization pulses , and are described in detail in @xcite . to identify surface electron recoils , 5 different analyses were performed , the rejection criteria being developed by using events with low ionization yield in the @xmath4ba data sets .",
    "the surface event analysis methods are described in detail in @xcite . in the simplest analysis technique ,",
    "the risetime of the largest phonon pulse , along with its time delay with respect to the ionization signal are used to form a timing parameter ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) .",
    "since surface events show a smaller timing parameter than most nuclear recoils from the @xmath5cf source , wimp - induced nuclear recoils are required to exceed a minimum value for this parameter .",
    "after un - masking the data , one candidate nuclear recoil event at 10.5kev was observed in ge , while no events were seen in the si data @xcite .",
    "although the candidate event occurred in a ge detector during a period of inefficient ionization collection , the result is consistent with the expected background from surface events .",
    "the derived upper limit on spin - independent wimp - nucleon cross sections is 1.6@xmath710@xmath8@xmath9 from ge , and 3.4@xmath710@xmath10@xmath9 from si , both at the 90%cl and at a wimp mass of 60gev / c@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1b ] shows the spin - independent limits as a function of the wimp mass , along with theoretical expectations from supersymmetric models .    in theories with flat universal extra dimensions ( ued )",
    "@xcite , the best studied dark matter candidate is @xmath12 , the first kaluza - klein ( kk ) mode of the hypercharge gauge boson . its thermal relic density has been calculated in @xcite and @xcite , including all the relevant coannihilation processes .",
    "it is compatible with wmap results for a wide range of lpk masses , and depends for instance on the masses of the first level kk quarks @xcite . in considering the direct detection of @xmath12 through elastic scattering off nuclei ,",
    "one starts , as in the case of the neutralino , at the quark level .",
    "the interaction takes place through kk - quark and higgs exchange , and in the extreme non relativistic limit divides into a spin - independent and a spin - dependent part .",
    "while q@xmath13 exchange contributes to both scalar and spin - dependent couplings , higgs exchange contributes only to the former one .",
    "since the contributions to the scalar interaction interfere constructively , there is a lower bound on both cross sections @xcite .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the masses of the first level quarks ( all degenerate ) , q@xmath13 are taken as a free parameter , and the ratio @xmath14=@xmath15 , which quantifies the mass splitting between @xmath12 and the kk - quarks , is varied from 10@xmath16 to 0.5 .",
    "the reach of cdms is then calculated and shown in the 2-dimensional plane of @xmath17 versus the lkp mass in figure  [ fig3 ] @xcite .",
    "the region excluded by the cdms ge ( si ) data is at the left of the curve labeled ge ( si ) .",
    "the expected sensitivity of future experiments such as supercdms @xcite and xenon1 t @xcite are also shown .",
    "the region above the red curve labeled 100% is excluded by wmap data , 100% corresponding to @xmath18 = 0.27 @xcite .    at present , 5 zip towers are installed in the soudan cryostat , for a total of 4.5 kg of ge and 1 kg of si .",
    "the 30 detectors have successfully been cooled down to base temperature and their performance is being checked with gamma calibration events .",
    "the wimp search run scheduled to start in fall 2006 is expected to yield a factor of @xmath010 increase in sensitivity ( dashed curve fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] ) .",
    "the proposed supercdms program @xcite is based on 640 g zip detectors with total masses of 25 kg , 150 kg and 1ton . with a target sensitivity of @xmath01@xmath710@xmath19@xmath9 , already the 25 kg phase would be complementary to lhc / ilc in the search for new physics at the weak scale . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , supercdms-1 t could test the entire region allowed by the wmap data for kaluza - klein dark matter in ued @xcite .",
