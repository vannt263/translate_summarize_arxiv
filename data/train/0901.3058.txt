    "the measurement of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite , parametrizing the non - perturbative hadron structure in hard exclusive processes , represents one of the challenges of nowadays hadronic physics ( for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gpds enter the long - distance dominated part of exclusive lepton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) off hadrons . deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , i.e. the process @xmath2 when @xmath3 , is one of the the most promising to access gpds ( here and in the following , @xmath4 is the momentum transfer between the leptons @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 the one between the hadrons @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "relevant experimental efforts to measure gpds are taking place , and a few dvcs data have been already published @xcite .",
    "the issue of measuring gpds for nuclei has been addressed in several papers . in the first one @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the knowledge of gpds would permit the investigation of the short light - like distance structure of nuclei , and thus the interplay of nucleon and parton degrees of freedom in the nuclear wave function .",
    "in inclusive dis off a nucleus with four - momentum @xmath10 and @xmath11 nucleons of mass @xmath12 , this information can be accessed in the region where @xmath13 , being @xmath14 and @xmath15 the energy transfer in the laboratory system . in this region measurements",
    "are very difficult , because of vanishing cross - sections .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the same physics can be accessed in dvcs at much lower values of @xmath16 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that , for finite nuclei , the measurement of gpds would provide us with peculiar information about the spatial distribution of energy , momentum and forces experienced by quarks and gluons inside hadrons . this argument has been retaken and confirmed recently in ref .",
    "dvcs has been extensively discussed for different nuclear targets .",
    "impulse approximation ( ia ) calculations , supposed to give the bulk of nuclear effects at @xmath17 , have been performed for the deuteron @xcite and for spinless nuclei @xcite , in particular for @xmath18 @xcite , for which an experiment is going on at jlab @xcite . for nuclei of any spin , estimates of gpds have been provided and prescriptions for nuclear effects have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "analyses of nuclear dvcs beyond ia , with estimates of shadowing effects and involving therefore large light - like distances and correlations in nuclei have been also performed @xcite .",
    "while several studies have shown that the measurement of nuclear gpds can unveil crucial information on possible medium modifications of nucleons in nuclei @xcite , great attention has to be paid to avoid to mistake them with conventional nuclear effects . to this respect , a special role",
    "would be played by few body nuclear targets , for which realistic studies are possible and exotic effects , such as the ones of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , not included in a realistic wave function , can be disentangled .",
    "to this aim , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a realistic ia calculation of the quark unpolarized gpd @xmath19 of @xmath20 has been presented .",
    "the study of gpds for @xmath0 is interesting for many aspects .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 is a well known nucleus , and it is extensively used as an effective neutron target : the properties of the free neutron are being investigated through experiments with nuclei ( the measurement of neutron gpds using nuclei has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whose data are analyzed taking nuclear effects properly into account .",
    "for example , it has been shown , firstly in @xcite , that unpolarized dis off trinucleons ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) can provide relevant information on pdfs at large @xmath16 , while it is known since a long time that its particular spin structure suggests the use of @xmath0 as an effective polarized neutron target @xcite . polarized",
    "@xmath0 will be therefore the first candidate for experiments aimed at the study of spin - dependent gpds of the free neutron . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gpd @xmath19 of @xmath20 has been evaluated using a realistic non - diagonal spectral function , so that momentum and binding effects are rigorously estimated .",
    "the scheme proposed in that paper is valid for @xmath21 and it permits to calculate gpds in the kinematical range relevant to the coherent , no break - up channel of deep exclusive processes off @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the latter channel can be hardly studied at large @xmath7 , due to the vanishing cross section @xcite .",
    "nuclear effects are found to be larger than in the forward case and to increase with @xmath7 at fixed skewedness , and with the skewedness at fixed @xmath7 .",
    "in particular the latter @xmath7 dependence does not simply factorize , in agreement with previous findings for the deuteron target @xcite and at variance with prescriptions proposed for finite nuclei @xcite .    here , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite is extended into various directions .",
    "the main point of the paper will be to stress that the properties of nuclear gpds should not be trivially inferred from those of nuclear parton distributions .",
    "after a fast summary of the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , in the third section of the paper a detailed study of the flavor dependence of the nuclear effects , which is due to the fact that @xmath0 is non isoscalar , is carried on ; a serious warning concerning the possibility to use momentum distributions instead of spectral functions is motivated ; the dependence on the choice of the nucleon - nucleon potential used to estimate the nuclear gpds is shown . in the following section ,",

    "3 .    from figs . 1 - 3",
    "three main conclusions can be drawn .",
    "1 ) first of all , if one infers properties of nuclear gpds thinking to those of nuclear pds , conventional nuclear effects as big as 10 % can be easily lost , or mistaken for exotic ones .",
    "2 ) secondly , this behavior is a typical conventional effect , being a prediction of ia in dis off nuclei .",
    "if a 10 % effect would be observable in experimental studies of nuclear gpds , the presence of such a flavor dependence , or its absence , would be clear signatures of the reaction mechanism of dis off nuclei .",
    "its presence would mean that the reaction involves essentially partons inside nucleons , whose dynamics is governed by a realistic potential in a conventional scenario ; on the contrary , its absence would mean that , in a different , exotic scenario , other degrees of freedom have to be advocated .",
    "3 ) eventually , it is clear that , for this kind of studies , @xmath0 is a unique target , for which experiments are worth to be done : the flavor dependence can not be investigated with isoscalar targets , such as @xmath114 or @xmath18 , while for heavier nuclei calculations can not be performed with comparable precision .      in the previous section",

    "when a momentum distribution is used instead of a spectral function , not only the ia , but also another approximation , the so called `` closure approximation '' , has been used : an average excitation energy , @xmath120 , has been inserted in the expression of the delta function appearing in the definition of the spectral function eq .",

    "in the ia approach discussed here , using eq .",

    "it would be very interesting to measure this ratio experimentally .",
    "if strong deviations from this predicted behavior were observed , there would be a clear evidence that the description in terms of ia , i.e. in terms of the conventional scenario of partons confined in nucleons bound together by a realistic interaction , breaks down .",
    "in other words one could have a clear signature of possible interesting exotic effects .",
    "one should notice that the trend obtained for the ratio eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) is almost flat ; this may have to do with the simple model used for the nucleon gpd in the convolution formula .",
    "the present analysis permits only to estimate the size of nuclear effects between the forward and the general case , and not to predict the @xmath39 behavior of the ratio with good precision . in any case , the possibilities offered by a @xmath1 target deserve more attention and will be discussed in more detail elsewhere .",
    "in this paper , using a realistic microscopic calculation , some peculiar conventional nuclear effects on the unpolarized quark gpd @xmath139 for @xmath0 have been investigated . by studying the dependence of nuclear effects on the flavor , the nucleon binding and the nucleon - nucleon potential ,",
    "the same three main conclusions have been obtained : 1 ) the size of nuclear effects found in inclusive dis should not be naively used to estimate the one expected for gpds ; 2 ) if conventional nuclear physics is not taken into account properly , several experimentally observable effects , each of the order of 10 % , could be mistaken for exotic ones ; 3 ) trinucleons represent unique targets to study these effects , since a comparably realistic treatment for heavier targets is a challenging task .",
    "it has also been shown that the simultaneous use of a @xmath0 and @xmath1 target would help disentangling the conventional effects from the exotic ones .",
    "the issue of applying the obtained gpds to estimate cross - sections and to establish the feasibility of experiments , is in progress and will be presented elsewhere . in particular",
    ", the study of polarized gpds will be very interesting , due to the peculiar spin structure of @xmath0 and its implications for the study of the angular momentum of the free neutron .",
