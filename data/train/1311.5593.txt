    "the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) , the odin satellite and the swedish eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ) were used to observe oh absorption ( 1665 and 1667 mhz ) ,  emission and absorption ( @xmath10 , 557 ghz ) , and  emission ( @xmath11 , 220 ghz ) .",
    "a comparison of the abundances of the three molecules may serve as a useful tool to probe the chemistry of interstellar molecular clouds .",
    "the oh and  line profiles are shown in fig",
    "the oh abundance appears to be enhanced by an order of magnitude in the cnd cloud core and is very likely also enhanced in the + 50 and + 20  cloud cores , compared to the abundances estimated in the line - of - sight spiral arm features .",
    "the  abundance is markedly enhanced in the front sides of the sgr a molecular cloud cores , @xmath12 , as observed in absorption and being highest in the cnd .",
    "a similar abundance enhancement is seen in oh . an unusually high oh/  ratio is also found in the clouds at the gc .",
    "the likely explanation is pdr chemistry including grain surface reactions , and perhaps also influences of shocks and turbulence in clouds . in the redward high - velocity line wings of the + 50 and + 20  clouds and the cnd , very high  abundances are found , @xmath13 , and suggested to be caused by the combined action of shock desorption from icy grain mantles and high temperature gas phase shock chemistry . in the + 50  cloud , three large clumps ( i , ii and iii ) , were identified in  emission , see fig .",
