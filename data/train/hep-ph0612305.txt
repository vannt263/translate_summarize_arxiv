    "cosmogenic neutrinos , produced in the scattering of protons off cosmic microwave background photons , have access to tev physics in interactions with terrestrial nucleons at center of mass energies @xmath0 $ \\sim$}}~}10 $ ]  tev .",
    "if the fundamental scale of gravity is @xmath1  tev @xcite , which may happen in @xmath2 spacetime dimensions , these @xmath3 interactions are transplanckian , @xmath4 .",
    "the only consistent theory known so far in such a regime , string theory , tells us that the interactions are soft in the ultraviolet .",
    "the scattering amplitudes vanish except in the forward region , an effect that can be understood as the destructive interference of string excitations @xcite .",
    "the forward amplitudes are dominated by the zero mode of the string , corresponding to the exchange of a gauge particle of spin 1 , @xmath5 , for open strings , or a graviton of spin 2 , @xmath6 , for closed strings .",
    "therefore , one expects that gravity dominates in transplanckian collisions .",
    "it must be noticed that present bounds on @xmath7 from colliders ( lep , tevatron ) @xcite or astrophysics and cosmology ( supernovae cooling )",
    "@xcite come from processes at energies below @xmath7 and are indirect , since they actually constrain the energy emitted to kaluza - klein gravitons of mass @xmath8 in the @xmath9 compact extra dimensions , which is a function of the compactification radius @xmath10 .",
    "those bounds rely on the assumption of all extra dimensions being large ( the effective and fundamental planck scales then relate through @xmath11 ) that can be evaded in more sophisticated compactification models @xcite . in contrast , transplanckian collisions probe @xmath7 directly and independently of compactification details .",
    "we have shown that gravitational interactions are the only relevant in the transplanckian regime of energies . in impact parameter space , one must keep in mind two critical values : the planck length @xmath12 and the schwarzschild radius @xmath13 .",
    "there are two types of interactions .",
    "short - distance interactions , with impact parameter @xmath14 $ \\sim$}}~}r_s$ ] , in which the colliding particles ( a neutrino and a parton inside the nucleon ) collapse into a black hole ( bh ) correspond to the exchange of strongly coupled gravitons of high momentum ( non - linear gravity ) .",
    "the collapse involves strongly coupled gravity and is not calculable perturbatively .",
    "most analyses are based on a geometric cross section @xcite @xmath15 for the partonic process , with @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 , namely @xmath18 , one expects that this estimate will not be off by any large factors @xcite . however , most of the bhs produced in the scattering of an ultrahigh energy neutrino off a parton are light , with masses just above @xmath7 , since the @xmath3 cross section is dominated by the low @xmath19 region . in this regime",
    "the amount of gravitational radiation emitted during the collapse or the topology of the singularity are important effects that add uncertainty to the geometric estimate .",
    "long - distance interactions , with @xmath20 , have to do with the exchange of weakly coupled gravitons of low momentum ( linearized gravity ) @xcite .",
    "in transplackian collisions quantum gravity acts inside the event horizon ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , these elastic interactions are due to classical gravity .",
    "they are characterized by a small deflection angle @xmath22 in the center of mass ( cm ) frame , @xmath23 the elastic collision of a neutrino and a parton that exchange @xmath24-dimensional gravitons is then described by the _",
    "eikonal _ amplitude resumming an infinite set of ladder and cross - ladder diagrams in the limit in which the momentum @xmath25 carried by each graviton is smaller than the cm energy or , in terms of the fraction of energy lost by the incoming neutrino , @xmath26 . in this limit the amplitude is independent of the spin of the colliding particles . essentially , @xmath27 is the exponentiation of the born amplitude in impact parameter space @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the eikonal phase , @xmath30 and a new scale @xmath31 appears , @xmath32^\\frac{1}{n}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total partonic cross sections can be obtained from the amplitudes above using the optical theorem .",
    "they are @xmath33 , growing faster with energy than the bh cross sections @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , in transplanckian collisions one may consider two types of processes @xcite : elastic ( long - distance ) _ soft _ processes where the neutrino transfers to the partons a small fraction @xmath35 of its energy and keeps going , and shorter distance ( @xmath36 ) _ hard _ processes where the neutrino loses in the collision most of its energy , possibly collapsing into a bh .",
    "we take @xmath37 , the typical inelasticity of a standard model ( sm ) interaction , but any value of the order of 0.1 yields similar results . on the other hand",
    ", there is a @xmath38 determined by the threshold energy @xmath39 transfered to a parton that produces an observable hadronic cascade .",
    "the corresponding @xmath3 cross sections are obtained by convolution with the parton distribution functions @xmath40 with the appropriate energy scale @xmath41 @xcite .    to estimate the relative frequency of both type of processes @xcite , consider a @xmath42  gev neutrino that scatters off a nucleon with @xmath43  tev and @xmath44  tev for @xmath45 extra dimensions .",
    "the number of eikonal interactions before the neutrino gets destroyed is the ratio of interaction lengths @xmath46 . for a sm interaction @xmath47  km while @xmath48  km ( 4 km ) in ice . the total energy lost by the neutrino in these eikonal interactions and",
    "the energy lost to graviton radiation are relatively small : @xmath49  gev ( @xmath50  gev ) and @xmath51  gev ( @xmath50  gev ) in 1 km of ice .",
    "the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos , yet unobserved , depends on the production rate of primary nucleons of energy around and above the gzk cutoff .",
    "it is correlated with proton and photon fluxes that must be consistent , respectively , with the number of ultrahigh energy events at agasa and hires @xcite and with the diffuse @xmath52-ray background measured by egret @xcite .",
    "we base our analysis on the two neutrino fluxes described in @xcite .",
    "the first one saturates the observations by egret , whereas for the second one the correlated flux of @xmath52-rays contribute only a 20% to the data , with the nucleon flux normalized in both cases to agasa / hires .",
    "the _ higher _ flux predicts 820 downward neutrinos of each flavor with energy between @xmath53  gev and @xmath54  gev per year and km@xmath55 , versus 370 for the _ lower _ one .",
    "the spectrum has a peak at neutrino energies between @xmath56  gev and @xmath42  gev .",
    "when a neutrino hits a nucleon it will start a hadronic shower . the total number of hadronic events in a neutrino telescope of cross sectional area @xmath57 in a time @xmath58 is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the probability that the neutrino survives to reach the detector and @xmath61 the probability that it interacts inside the detector : @xmath62 with @xmath19 the column density of material , @xmath63 the zenith angle and @xmath64 the longitudinal detector size .",
    "when @xmath64 is larger than the interaction length @xmath65 , there may be multiple - bang events . neglecting the energy lost by the neutrino in each interaction ,",
    "the probability of @xmath66 bangs and the average , and most probable , number of bangs are , respectively @xmath67         the different probabilities for a typical cosmogenic neutrino of @xmath42  gev reaching vertically icecube are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for illustration .",
    "double - bang events could also be produced by sm interactions ( the decay of a tau created in a first interaction ) or in the bh evaporation .",
    "for the double - bang tau event to be contained inside a detector like icecube ( 1 km of length with 125 m between strings ) , the energy of the tau lepton must be between @xmath68 gev and @xmath69 gev . in this case , the probability is only @xmath70 .    the energy distribution of the hadronic cascades and the total number of black hole and eikonal events at amanda ( 0.03 km@xmath55 and a length of 700 m ) and icecube ( 1 km@xmath71 ) for the neutrino fluxes introduced above are given in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , respectively . in the sm",
    "we expect 1.32 ( 0.50 ) contained events per year in icecube for the higher ( lower ) flux . of those",
    ", 0.38 ( 0.14 ) would come from a neutral current and 0.94 ( 0.36 ) from a charged current .",
    "cosmogenic neutrinos directly probe tev gravity in transplackian collisions with nucleons at earth if there are @xmath2 spacetime dimensions .",
    "two types of interactions take place .",
    "hard processes , when the impact parameter is smaller than the schwarzschild radius of the neutrino - parton system , produce mostly light black holes with theoretically uncertain cross sections . at larger distances ,",
    "soft elastic processes occur in which the neutrinos lose a small fraction of energy to a hadronic shower , in a well known regime described by the eikonal approximation .",
    "the latter turn out to be dominant and produce a clear signal in large neutrino telescopes : contained hadronic showers without charged leptons .",
    "furthermore , this signal can not be confused with ordinary sm events due to an unexpectedly high neutrino flux because in the sm 24% of the events are accompanied by muons and multiple - bang events are very suppressed , in contrast to the elastic gravitational events .",
    "the values of the fundamental scale of gravity that icecube could reach are comparable to those to be explored at the lhc .      n.  arkani - hamed , s.  dimopoulos and g.  dvali , phys .",
