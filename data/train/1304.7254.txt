    "the search for new superconducting materials and the opportunity to discover further evidence of non - bcs mechanisms of electron pairing attracted attention of researchers to iron pnictides  @xcite and chalcogenides  @xcite . among these materials",

    "these fe(1 ) atoms , tetrahedrally coordinated by chalcogen atoms , form layers separated by van der waals gaps . in consequence the `` 11 ''",
    "systems can be regarded as quasi two - dimensional .",
    "nevertheless , this structure features an intrinsic disorder due to both excess iron in partially occupied fe(2 ) positions  @xcite and substituted atoms , which are displaced with respect to the te crystallographic positions .",

    "moreover , the superconducting fraction of untreated fete@xmath11s@xmath12 as determined from magnetic susceptibility is close to 20 %  @xcite .",
    "the direct connection between the iron overstoichiometry , magnetism and superconductivity can be exposed by topotactic deintercalation using iodine  @xcite or other oxidation processes like annealing in oxygen  @xcite .",
    "samples with the lowest content of excess iron have the highest sc fraction reaching 100% .",
    "the promising fact is that under high pressure the transition to superconductivity reaches t=37 k for fese  @xcite .",
    "while the mechanism of electron pairing in the fe - based superconductors is still under debate , the electronic band structure can impose certain conditions on possible scenarios  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fermi surface ( fs ) and the electronic band structure of the discussed systems have been extensively studied by means of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , quantum oscillations and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations  @xcite . in particular , the previous arpes studies on `` 11 '' chalcogenides covered both non - superconducting fe@xmath7te  @xcite and superconducting fe@xmath7te@xmath13se@xmath9  @xcite but corresponding results for fese or fe@xmath7te@xmath13s@xmath9 are absent in the literature so far .",
    "while the published data for fe@xmath7te@xmath13se@xmath9 are relatively consistent , studies of fe@xmath7te present two aspects : on the one hand clearly visible band topography  @xcite , on the other hand intrinsically broad spectra in a paramagnetic state with emergence of quasiparticle peaks in the spin density wave ( sdw ) state  @xcite . the latter scenario is confirmed by a more recent study of fe@xmath14te and becomes understood in terms of polaron formation  @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface of superconducting fe@xmath7te@xmath13se@xmath9 chalcogenides consists of hole pockets located around the @xmath3(z ) point and electron pockets in the region of the m(a ) point , which is typical of both iron pnictides and chalcogenides .",
    "however , the newer a@xmath15fe@xmath16se@xmath17 systems ( a = k , cs , rb , tl , etc . ) are exceptional in that respect as they exhibit electron pockets at @xmath3(z)point  @xcite .",

    "differences are also visible for the @xmath3-z direction .",
    "a dispersion along @xmath3-z is a matter of interest , as it may indicate whether the system is two - dimensional .",
    "in fact , weak dispersions or even lack of dispersion for certain bands are observed , what is seen in particular for the kkr - cpa approach .",
    "this means that this system may be considered as quasi two - dimensional to some extent .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the dispersions near @xmath3 obtained with kkr - cpa are characterized with lower slopes and higher band masses as compared to lapw+lo at low binding energies .",
    "the discrepancies between the obtained band structures may have arisen from different exchange - correlation potential and different modeling of atomic spheres in the approaches as well as due to the differences between the objects of the studies ; fe@xmath10te@xmath33s@xmath34 and fete .",
    "to obtain the agreement between the experiment and the theory the fermi energy for the calculated band structure needs to be shifted up by 0.11 ev and 0.10 ev for kkr - cpa and lapw+lo respectively .    the band structure obtained from the calculations",
    "is generally consistent with the arpes results both along the @xmath3-m and @xmath3-x directions assuming that certain bands may be invisible in the experiment due to unfavourable matrix elements . out of the three hole pockets predicted by calculations at least two hole - like bands at @xmath3",

    "the same polarization also yields a very flat quasiparticle band with strong intensity near the @xmath3 point ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "in fact , due to its high effective mass the dispersion was not measurable and the band exhibits practically constant binding energy determined to be 3 - 5 mev above the fermi level .",

    "this result shows that the estimation of band renormalization can be uncertain , as it depends on the used approach in band structure calculations .",
    "the kkr - cpa approach yields higher effective mass in the theoretical dispersions , what implies lower mass renormalization .",
    "the next important point is band dimensionality , which can be explored by a photon energy dependent study .",
    "therefore , the region of @xmath3 was investigated with energies between 22.5 ev and 50 ev ( figure [ photon ] ) .",
    "the outer part of the hole pocket ( @xmath38 ) can always be detected with @xmath29-polarization .",
    "the flat dispersion near @xmath3 ( @xmath36 ) can be seen for photon energies of 40 ev , 45 ev and 50 ev . on the other hand ,",
    "its intensity is suppressed for 22.5 ev and 30 ev .",
    "there are two optional explanations for this fact : a dispersion along the wave vector component perpendicular to the surface ( @xmath44 ) or a photoionization cross section effect . to estimate the change of @xmath44 for the considered photon energy range one may use the free electron final state ( fefs ) model  @xcite with a typical value of @xmath45=15 ev for the inner potential estimated in a case of iron pnictides  @xcite .",

    "the hole bands @xmath35 and @xmath38 appearing around the @xmath3 point have their counterparts in the theoretical results .",
    "although it is not obvious to what extent the calculations for pure fete are reliable for fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 , they can narrow down the list of possible band characters .",
    "the calculations yield that the @xmath35 band has mainly @xmath58 orbital character , while @xmath38 is dominated by @xmath58 and @xmath50 with some contribution of @xmath48 along @xmath3-x .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental results obtained both along @xmath3-m and @xmath3-x directions . in contrast",
    ", the calculations for fete do not reveal the flat band at the fermi energy with dominant @xmath5 orbital character , which would correspond to @xmath38 . in this aspect",
    "they are not compatible with the experiment for fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "one may expect that s doping in fe@xmath7te@xmath8s@xmath31 system may have a particular effect on the @xmath5 orbital as it results in shrinking the @xmath59 lattice constant .",
    "the band structure of superconducting fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 was studied along the @xmath3-x and @xmath3-m directions by arpes . an increased spectral intensity at @xmath4",
    "is observed near the @xmath3 and m points . in particular , two hole bands ( @xmath35 and @xmath38 ) are found around @xmath3 with a high intensity quasiparticle peak ( @xmath36 ) located close to @xmath4 , with no evidence of dispersion .",
    "this latter feature has mainly @xmath5 orbital character and is interpreted as the maximum of the @xmath38 hole band or an evidence of another hole pocket .",
    "such a band structure yields a high density of states at the chemical potential , interpreted as a van hove singularity .",
    "measurements performed with variable photon energy show no dispersion of the @xmath38 hole band as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "hence , it is considered as two dimensional .",
    "the flat part of the band located at @xmath4 has a reduced intensity for the photon energies of 30 ev and 22.5 ev , which is attributed to a low photoionization cross - section .",
    "the band structure obtained from kkr - cpa calculations includes the broadening due to disorder and exhibits three hole pockets in @xmath3 and two electron pockets at m. further lapw - lo calculations performed for stoichiometric fete lead to a band topography , which is in reasonable agreement with the kkr - cpa results and the experiment for fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "the orbital characters calculated with the lapw - lo method agree with the experimental results for @xmath35 and @xmath38 dispersions but are inconsistent with the @xmath5 character observed for the flat @xmath36 spectrum .",
