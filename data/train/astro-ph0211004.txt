    "psr j1740@xmath03052 was discovered in 1997 in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and still leaves a number of fundamental questions unanswered .",
    "it is a young , unrecycled pulsar ( @xmath1ms , @xmath2 kyr ) in a 231-day , highly eccentric orbit about a companion of at least 11 solar masses whose nature is undetermined . while there is a late - type star coincident with the interferometric position of the pulsar",
    ", we have argued that this is probably _ not _ the pulsar companion , and that an early b - star or even a black hole is more likely ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we present an up - to - date analysis of ongoing multifrequency observations of this pulsar , and explore what these data may tell us about the true pulsar companion .",
    "parkes observations were taken at 2380 , 1400 and 660mhz , using multichannel filterbanks and 1-bit digitization .",
    "the 1400mhz data have been taken regularly since mid-1998 , while data at the other two frequencies have been acquired primarily in the weeks leading up to various periastron epochs .",
    "some 1400mhz data were also acquired regularly at jodrell bank observatory from mid-1998 through the end of 2000 . since sept .",
    "2001 , we have been monitoring psr j1740@xmath03052 with the new 100-m green bank telescope ( gbt ) , using regular 34 week spacing with more frequent sampling in the lead - ups to periastrons . at each epoch ,",
    "multifrequency data were acquired with the `` berkeley - caltech pulsar machine '' ( bcpm ) flexible filterbank : typically centre frequencies of 2200 , 1400 , 1190 and 590mhz were used , with occasional points at 1780 or 820mhz .",
    "all profiles were dedispersed and folded according to the predicted topocentric period .",
    "toas were obtained by cross - correlation and fit to a pulse timing model using tempo .",
    "the templates at different frequencies were aligned by cross - correlation and ( for those with scattering tails ) by timing .",
    "the timing model used was that for pulsar  main - sequence binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "along with the five standard keplerian orbital parameters , two corrections representing secular evolution of the observed orbit must also be fit .",
    "these are the advance of periastrion ( @xmath3 , now a 5-@xmath4 detection ) , and a preliminary ( 4-@xmath4 ) measurement of @xmath5 , the apparent change of the projected semi - major axis of the orbit ( see figure  [ fig : xdot ] ) .",
    "the measured @xmath3 is likely due to a mixture of general relativistic orbital precession and precession due to the spin quadrupole of the companion star ; @xmath5 can only be interpreted as due to the companion spin ",
    "the pulsar is distant ( @xmath6 kpc ) and its proper motion is not measurable for reasonable velocities , so this can not affect the observed @xmath5 ( @xcite ) . intriguingly , the measured value of @xmath3 , @xmath7yr@xmath8 , is very close to the general relativistic prediction for an edge - on orbit .",
    "it is therefore important to try to estimate the inclination angle of the system , as this will determine the spin - quadrupole contribution .",
    "the multifrequency gbt and pre - periastron parkes data allow us to estimate the dispersion measure ( dm ) at multiple epochs throughout the orbit ( figure  [ fig : dmvar ] ) .",
    "the most abrupt changes occur in the month before periastron , as the pulsar swings `` behind '' its companion .",
    "the measured dm variations are 23 orders of magnitude too small to be accounted for by a k - star wind ( @xcite ) .",
    "instead , we use a simple model of the mass - loss and velocity for a line - driven b - star wind ( see @xcite and references therein ) and integrate the total expected dm contribution from the wind along the line of sight to the pulsar .",
    "we then scale these predictions to match the range of observed dm variations , and compare the _ shape _ of the predicted curve to the observed values .",
    "a simple @xmath9 analysis indicates that the best inclination angle is around 70@xmath1075@xmath10 and the required scaling implies a mass - loss rate @xmath11/yr and terminal velocity 2200 km / s , which are typical values for a b - star .",
    "the model is therefore self - consistent .",
    "an estimated inclination angle of 70@xmath10 implies a companion mass of 12.8m@xmath12 assuming a neutron - star mass of 1.35m@xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spin quadrupole contribution to @xmath3 is therefore small and likely negative .",
    "its exact value depends not only on the rotation rate and internal structure of the star , but also on the precession phase @xmath13 and the misalignment @xmath14 of the stellar spin with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the spin - induced @xmath5 depends in the same way on the stellar spin and structure , and so the ratio of the two measured parameters can be used to constrain the two unknown angles ( @xcite ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the inclination angle of the orbit . allowing for 2@xmath4 variation in both @xmath3 and @xmath5 , we find that @xmath14 is most likely to be in the range @xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "this misalignment is likely due to an asymmetric kick in the supernova that created the pulsar . with ongoing long - term timing",
    ", we will refine the measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath5 and begin to search for the predicted second derivative of each parameter , which will lead to further constraints on the orbital geometry ."
