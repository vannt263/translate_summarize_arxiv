    "cosmology is living a golden age thanks to the analysis of high quality data that are being collected during the last years by several experiments . among the observables",
    "used to probe the nature of the universe , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and polarization fluctuations provide a unique tool that is helping to establish a well defined picture of the origin , evolution , and matter and energy content of the universe  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however , since the public release of the wmap 1st - year data in 2003  @xcite , and the subsequent data releases  @xcite , several results have been reported that seem to challenge the statistically isotropic and gaussian nature of the cmb , predicted by the standard inflationary theory .    among these anomalies , the exceptionally large and cold spot ( hereinafter the cold spot or cs ) that was identified in the southern hemisphere ( l = @xmath0 , b = @xmath1 ) through a wavelet analysis  @xcite is one of the features that has attracted more attention from the scientific community .",
    "the cs has been widely confirmed by subsequent analyses  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , carried out by different groups and using different kinds of techniques .",
    "recently  @xcite have claimed that the cold spot originally found by  @xcite was , actually , an artifact caused by the particular choice of the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) as the tool to analyse the data . to support this argument",
    ", the authors showed how the use of isotropic filters with variable width , like a top - hat or a gaussian function , failed to provide a deviation from gaussianity .",
    "we do not agree with the conclusions reached in that paper .",
    "the results obtained by the authors just indicate that not all filtering kernels are equally optimal to detect or amplify a particular signature",
    ". in particular , wavelets ( which are compensated filters ) are better suited for this purpose than other non - optimised kernels .",
    "it is well known that wavelets increase the signal - to - noise ratio of those features with a characteristic scale similar to the one of the wavelet .",
    "this amplification is obtained by filtering out the instrumental noise and the inflationary cmb fluctuations at smaller and larger scales .",
    "the arguments given by  @xcite have been merely repeated by  @xcite in a recent work .",
    "a number of possible explanations for the cs have been suggested in the literature , namely contamination from residual foregrounds  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , particular brane - world models  @xcite , the collision of cosmological bubbles  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the non - linear integrated sachs - wolfe effect produced by the large scale structure  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or inverse compton scattering via the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , supported by the presence of a large cluster of galaxies in the direction of the cs  ( the eridanus super - group , * ? ? ?",
    "however , some works have shown that these explanations are very unlikely  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since , depending on the case , they would require very special conditions to be able to explain the cs , such as a very particular mixing - up of the foreground emissions , an unfeasible electron gas distribution , a very peculiar situation of the milky way with respect to some hypothetical large voids , or the existence of huge voids much larger than the ones expected from the standard structure formation scenario . in particular , the latter would imply a much more extreme departure from gaussianity than the one that these models are trying to explain !    nevertheless , there is an alternative hypothesis that has not been ruled out yet , which is compatible with current observations .",
    "@xcite suggested that the cs could be produced by the non - linear evolution of the gravitational potential generated by a collapsing cosmic texture . in that work",
    ", a bayesian analysis showed that the texture hypothesis was preferred with respect to the pure standard gaussian scenario , and that the values describing the properties of the texture were compatible with current cosmological observations .",
    "in particular , the energy scale for the symmetry breaking that generates this particular type of topological defect ( @xmath2 gev ) , was in agreement with the upper limits established by means of the angular power spectrum  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "of course , this result does not guarantee by itself the existence of cosmic textures , nor that the cs is caused by a collapsing texture .",
    "in fact , further tests are needed , and some of them were already indicated in  @xcite .",
    "first , the texture model makes predictions about the expected number of cosmic textures with an angular scale equal or greater than @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the presence of around 20 cosmic textures with @xmath4 is predicted . some works , like  @xcite ,",
    "have already reported the existence of other anomalous spots , which could potentially be related to the presence of additional textures .",
    "second , the pattern of the cmb lensing signal induced by such a texture is known , and high resolution cmb experiments ( like the atacama cosmology telescope and the south pole telescope ) should be able to detect such a signal , if present .",
    "this issue has recently been addressed by  @xcite .",
    "finally , the polarization of the cmb is an additional source of information that provides further insight on the texture hypothesis .",
    "a lack of polarization is expected for the texture hypothesis , as compared to the typical values associated to large fluctuations of a gaussian and isotropic random field .",
    "this is because the effect of a collapsing texture on the cmb photons is merely gravitational .",
    "this difference in the polarization is the topic of this work .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth recalling that a collapsing texture is not the only way of producing a local non - linear evolution of the gravitational potential , and , therefore , a relative lack of the local polarization signal .",
    "other physical processes could also generate such a secondary anisotropy on the cmb photons .",
    "in fact , some of these effects have also been proposed as possible explanations for the cs .",
    "for instance , as previously mentioned , a very large void  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could produce the required non - linear evolution and , therefore , it would be affected by a relative lack of polarization . however , this explanation is discarded from both current large scale structure modelling  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and dedicated observations  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in this paper we consider the non - linear integrated sachs - wolfe ( also called rees - sciama ) effect caused by a collapsing texture as the most plausible explanation . in any case , we remark that the results derived in this paper for the texture model can also be expected in the most general situation of any physical process producing cmb secondary anisotropies , in the form of large spots in temperature , via the non - linear sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : chara ] we provide a characterisation of the radial profile ( both in temperature and polarization ) for gaussian spots as extreme as the cs . for comparison",
    ", we also investigate the case of random positions .",
    "a method , which exploits the correlation between the temperature and the polarization profiles , is proposed to discriminate between the gaussian ( null ) and the texture ( alternative ) hypotheses in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "the results are given in section  [ sec : results ] , where the ability to discriminate between the two considered hypotheses is discussed for different instrumental sensitivities .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : final ] .",
    "as already mentioned , the cross - correlation of the temperature ( @xmath5 ) and polarization ( @xmath6 ) signals around the position of the cs , could be an excellent discriminator between the null and alternative hypotheses .",
    "in other words , this quantity could indicate whether this feature is better described by a standard gaussian and isotropic field , or , conversely , by a non - standard cosmological model producing temperature spots which do not present a correlated polarization feature ( as the topological defects ) . in this latter case ,",
    "the cs is assumed to be caused by a secondary anisotropy of the cmb photons , altered by a non - linearly evolving gravitational potential produced , for instance , by a collapsing cosmic texture .",
    "hence , this _ alternative _ hypothesis ( @xmath7 ) would correspond to cmb fluctuations generated by the standard inflationary model , but with a non - negligible contribution from topological defects ( as it would be the case for the cs ) .",
    "conversely , the _ null _ hypothesis ( @xmath8 ) would be the case in which all the cmb fluctuations ( including the cs ) are due to a pure standard gaussian and isotropic field .",
    "it is interesting to point out that for the case of the alternative hypothesis , the e - mode signal is not expected to contain contributions from scalar perturbations but only from vector perturbations , which are around one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "therefore , for a cmb temperature feature as extreme as the cs , one would expect more polarization signal if such temperature fluctuation is caused by the standard inflationary model , than for the case in which , for instance , a collapsing cosmic texture is producing such a large spot .",
    "we aim to characterise the cmb temperature and ( e - mode ) polarization features through a radial profile .",
    "the reason to adopt this characterisation is simple : the shape of the cs is close to spherical , with a typical size of around 10 degrees  @xcite .    at this point , it is important to recall that the cs was first identified as an anomalous feature with an amplitude of @xmath9 times the dispersion of the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) coefficients at a wavelet scale @xmath10 arcmin  ( for details see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "follow - up tests explored additional characteristics of the cs finding even lower p - values  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but for the sake of simplicity and robustness , we adopt the original detection as the statistical property that characterises the cs .",
    "let us define , for a given position @xmath11 , the radial profile in temperature @xmath12 and in polarization @xmath13 as : @xmath14 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the temperature and the e - mode polarization maps , respectively .",
    "the sums are extended over the positions @xmath15 which are at a distance @xmath16 from @xmath11 i.e .",
    ", @xmath17 such as : @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "@xmath19 is the width of the considered rings and @xmath20 represents the number of positions ( or pixels in a map at a given angular resolution ) satisfying the previous condition .    in figure",
    "[ fig : profiles ] we plot the mean value and dispersion of the temperature and polarization radial profiles for two different cases .",
    "the first case , labelled as _ extrema _ , corresponds to the radial profiles @xmath12 and @xmath13 associated to positions @xmath21 where the cmb gaussian temperature field has a feature , at least , as extreme as the cs ( i.e. , having an amplitude above 4.57 times the dispersion of the wavelet coefficients at a wavelet scale @xmath10 arcmin , in absolute value ) . note that , although the cs is actually cold ( i.e , it is a minimum ) , in this work we will consider the more general case of having an extremum of the cmb field .",
    "we adopt this criterion since , for the case of cosmic textures , either hot or cold spots can be produced .",
    "the second case is labelled as _ random _ , and it corresponds to the radial profiles associated to random positions @xmath22 selected in the cmb gaussian temperature field .",
    "these mean radial profiles have been obtained after averaging over many simulations , carrying out the following procedure .",
    "first , a cmb gaussian simulation is generated ( containing t , q , and u maps ) at a resolution given by the healpix  @xcite parameter @xmath23 .",
    "subsequently , the temperature component of the simulation is filtered with the smhw at a scale @xmath24 arcmin .",
    "a feature as extreme as the cs is then sought in the wavelet coefficient map .",
    "if this is not found , a new simulation is generated .",
    "conversely , if a cs - like feature is present in the temperature map , we compute the e map from the pseudo - scalars q and u , as well as the temperature @xmath25 and polarization @xmath26 profiles at the position @xmath21 where the extremum is located . in addition , a random position in the temperature map is selected and the @xmath27 and @xmath28 profiles are computed at this random position @xmath22 .    the left panel in figure  [ fig : profiles ] shows both cases ( _ extrema _ as the blue solid line , and _",
    "random _ as the green dot - dashed line ) for temperature , while the right panel corresponds to the ( e - mode ) polarization .",
    "let us remark that , for _ extrema _ that are cold spots , the absolute value of the profile has been considered .",
    "the curves show the profiles from 0.5 to 25 degrees , with a step of @xmath29 degrees .",
    "we also plot the 1-@xmath30 level ( dotted lines ) associated to the probability distribution of the profiles at a given distance , obtained from the 10000 simulations used to compute these estimates .",
    "note that , for the case of the polarization signal , the _ extrema _ and the _ random _ profiles overlap at the 1-@xmath30 level , which indicates that very little information can be obtained from the analysis of the polarization signal alone .",
    "this is a justification to consider the polarization information only via the cross - correlation with the temperature fluctuations .",
    "hence , the differences between these curves , expressed in terms of their mutual correlations , are the ingredients used to define a methodology to discriminate between the standard gaussian ( null ) and the non - standard _ cosmic texture _",
    "( alternative ) hypotheses .",
    "this is addressed in the next section .",
    "in this section we describe a methodology to distinguish between the competitive hypotheses already mentioned : the standard gaussian and isotropic inflationary model ( @xmath8 , null hypothesis ) , and a non - standard model that accounts , for instance , for cosmic textures , in addition to cmb fluctuations coming from the standard inflationary model ( @xmath7 , alternative hypothesis ) .",
    "the key point to discriminate between these two scenarios is to exploit the differences between the cross - correlation of the temperature @xmath31 and the polarization @xmath32 radial profiles described in the previous section .",
    "let us define , first , these two hypotheses ( sections  [ subsec : signal_h0 ] and  [ subsec : signal_h1 ] ) in terms of the temperature and polarization profiles . afterwards",
    "( section  [ subsec : discriminator ] ) we will build the discriminator , based on the fisher discriminant .",
    "under the assumption of the null hypothesis @xmath8 ( i.e. , a cmb signal completely described in terms of the standard inflationary model ) , the cross - correlation of the temperature and polarization profiles at position @xmath21 ( i.e. , where the cmb temperature map presents a cs - like feature ) is given by : @xmath33 @xmath34 is a vector with @xmath35 components ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) . in our analysis",
    "we have @xmath37 since we consider values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 from 1 to 18 degrees , with @xmath40 degree .",
    "we have tested that including smaller or larger scales does not increase significantly the discrimination ability of our estimator . after averaging over simulations ,",
    "we can obtain both , the mean value of this signal vector ( @xmath41 ) , and the covariance matrix among the different components of the vector ( @xmath42 , with dimension @xmath43 ) .",
    "we define the @xmath44-component of the signal vector and the @xmath45-element of the covariance matrix as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total number of simulations used to compute these estimators . in our analysis , we consider @xmath47 = 10,000 .              under the assumption of the alternative hypothesis @xmath7 ( e.g. , the case in which",
    "the cmb fluctuations are generated from the standard gaussian and isotropic field , plus a contribution of cosmic textures which is , indeed , responsible for the cs ) , the cross - correlation of the temperature and polarization profiles at position @xmath21 ( where the cmb temperature map has a feature as extreme as the cs ) is given by : @xmath48 where the first term at the right - hand side of the equation corresponds to the correlation between a radial profile in temperature for a cs - like feature , and a radial profile in polarization associated to a typical fluctuation generated by the gaussian and isotropic component .",
    "this term accounts for the fact that a cosmic texture would add an almost negligible polarization signal . as already mentioned , the reason is that textures do not produce e - mode scalar perturbations , but vector perturbations , which are one order of magnitude smaller than the former .",
    "in addition , the term @xmath49 is a small correction ( as compared to the previous term ) that can be seen as a bias accounting from the residual correlations between the temperature and polarization profiles in a random position @xmath22 of the cmb @xmath5 map , i.e. , @xmath50 , where : @xmath51 with @xmath52 note that the bias term @xmath49 is required to account for the typical correlations that exist between the temperature and the polarization field . in other words , it accounts for the te cross - correlations due to the underlying isotropic and gaussian fluctuations , where the cs ( caused by the cosmic texture ) is placed .    as in the previous case",
    ", @xmath53 is a vector with @xmath35 components .",
    "its mean value ( @xmath54 ) and covariance matrix accounting for the correlations between the components ( @xmath55 ) are given by : @xmath56 as before , @xmath47 is the total number of simulations ( 10,000 ) used to compute these estimators .",
    "the signal vectors defining the @xmath8 and @xmath7 hypotheses ( @xmath34 and @xmath57 , respectively ) contain all the required information to distinguish between these two different scenarios",
    ". however , a practical way to add together all this information is required ( each vector has @xmath58 components ) .",
    "there are different possibilities , such as building a @xmath59 .",
    "however , we prefer to adopt a mechanism that provides an optimal way to combine this information in the sense of obtaining the largest separation between the two hypotheses : the fisher discriminant  @xcite . the reader can find applications of the fisher discriminant related to cmb gaussianity studies in several works  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fisher discriminant applied to @xmath20 signals corresponding to the @xmath8 hypothesis , provides a set of @xmath20 numbers ( @xmath60 ) where all the information available for the null hypothesis @xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath34 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) has been optimally combined . to construct this combination ,",
    "the overall properties of the alternative hypothesis @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) are also taken into account .",

    "as mentioned in the previous section , 10,000 simulations have been used to estimate the mean value of the signal vectors ( @xmath34 and @xmath57 ) , that contain the cross - correlation between the profiles @xmath67 and @xmath68 , as well as the covariance matrices @xmath42 and @xmath69 defining the correlation between the components of these vectors .",
    "one thousand additional simulations have been used to calculate the distribution of the fisher discriminants @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we have studied the power of the proposed methodology to distinguish between the null ( @xmath8 ) and the alternative ( @xmath7 ) hypotheses , for different instrumental noise levels in the polarization maps ( @xmath70 ) . in particular , we have studied in detail three scenarios corresponding to an ideal instrument ( @xmath71 ) , to the quijote experiment  ( @xmath72k per square degree , see * ? ? ?",

    "that the null hypothesis is correct , one would expect a significant cross - correlation signal with an amplitude corresponding to that of the largest spot in the temperature sky . on the contrary , if the alternative hypothesis is true , no additional polarization ( and thus no cross - correlation ) signal would be expected from the gravitational effect of the texture collapse . in this latter case ,",
