    "the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) is now creating strongly - interacting matter at high enough energy density that there is every expectation that temperatures above the qcd phase transition are being explored .",
    "the question of equilibration is crucial to the understanding of these collisions .",
    "there has been much progress on one aspect of this question recently : we now know that ( at least at arbitrarily high collision energies ) an equilibrated quark - gluon plasma _ will _ be created  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the first analyses of elliptic flow data can be interpreted as indicating early thermalization in rhic collisions   @xcite .",
    "what remains quite unclear , however , is whether even if an equilibrated partonic medium is attained early in the collision , thermal equilibrium is maintained as the matter cools through the qcd phase transition and becomes a gas of hadrons , which subsequently freeze out and are seen in a detector .",
    "the qcd phase transition is likely a smooth crossover if it is traversed at low baryon number chemical potential @xmath2 . at larger @xmath2 ,",
    "it is thought to be first order .",
    "this means that at a critical @xmath2 , there is a second order phase transition in the universality class of the three - dimensional ising model  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the possible nonequilibrium phenomena are quite different in these three cases  @xcite .",
    "if the transition is first order , bubbling may yield a spatially inhomogeneous final state  @xcite . if the transition occurs near the second order critical point",
    ", then nonequilibrium effects tend to obscure the unique fluctuations characteristic of the equilibrium critical point : in equilibrium , the correlation length would diverge there ; nonequilibrium effects smooth out this divergence  @xcite .",
    "the farther from equilibrium the evolution is , the less likely are distinctive signatures of the critical point .",
    "finally , if the transition is a crossover , as is likely at rhic where @xmath2 is small , and if this crossover is traversed sufficiently quickly that the dynamics can be treated as a `` maximally out of equilibrium '' quench , then long wavelength oscillations of the chiral condensate are excited to amplitudes which are greatly in excess of those present in equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the primary signal of these disorientations of the chiral condensate ( dcc ) is a large number of soft pions exhibiting large fluctuations in isospin  @xcite , which have been looked for and not seen in lower energy heavy ion collisions at the cern sps  @xcite .",
    "many other dcc signatures have also been discussed  @xcite .",
    "the crucial unresolved question in all three cases is : `` how rapid must the cooling be in order for the evolution to deviate significantly from thermal equilibrium ? '' in this paper , we lay the ground work for answering this question in the case of a smooth crossover .",
    "we construct a langevin description of the nonequilibrium dynamics of the chiral condensate which we can use over a range of temperatures around the phase transition .",
    "our dynamical degrees of freedom are those of the classical linear sigma model .",
    "this is valid as long as @xmath3 and @xmath4 are much smaller than the temperature .",
    "it is therefore valid near @xmath5 sufficiently close to the chiral limit .",
    "we shall use it with parameters chosen to reproduce the physical pion mass at zero temperature , and this will mean that we are using the classical theory beyond its realm of quantitative validity . until quantum field theoretical approaches ( for example those of refs .",
    "@xcite ) mature to the point where they can be used to describe spatially varying field configurations , the present classical analysis is of value as a guide .",
    "why introduce a langevin heat bath ? that is , why go beyond the purely classical analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite ? allowing the long wavelength degrees of freedom to exchange energy with a heat bath is a crude way of representing the existence of other degrees of freedom .",
    "our reason for introducing it is that we wish to investigate the response of the long wavelength degrees of freedom to decreases in the temperature @xmath6 of the heat bath that occur with varying speeds .",
    "if @xmath6 is reduced arbitrarily slowly , the system must stay arbitrarily close to equilibrium . if @xmath6 is reduced suddenly , nonequilibrium dynamics results . with a langevin equation , therefore",
    ", we shall be able to learn how fast the cooling must be in a heavy ion collision if the traversal of the crossover region of the phase transition is to be associated with dcc phenomena .",
    "in addition to a time varying heat bath temperature , we shall also be able to use the freedom to let @xmath6 vary as a function of position to consider initial conditions in which the hot region is finite in extent .",
    "we leave the answer to the questions just posed to a subsequent paper . here",
    ", we focus on setting up the langevin description , and choosing all the associated parameters .",
    "many parameters can be chosen entirely with reference to properties of the system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we can fix these parameters by comparison with known results from chiral perturbation theory and lattice gauge theory . in so doing we obtain a langevin equation which gives a reasonable description of the equilibrium physics from very low temperatures up to temperatures well above @xmath5 .",
    "this is possible in equilibrium , but the classical description of _ dynamics _ must break down at low temperatures , where @xmath7 .",
    "we discover this breakdown when we seek to fix those parameters in the langevin equation which require dynamical input , namely the viscosity @xmath1 . to this end",
    ", we analyze the decay of an idealized dcc with time , due to the presence of the heat bath .",
    "this problem has been analyzed previously by steele and koch  @xcite , and we use their results to fix the viscosity in our langevin equation . we find that in the vicinity of @xmath5 , where we expect our treatment to be valid , we can successfully reproduce the dcc decay timescale of ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to do so , the @xmath8 we introduce is about a factor of five larger than that predicted by perturbative calculation  @xcite . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the whole analysis breaks down : even with the dissipation due to the heat bath completely removed by setting @xmath8 to zero , we find that the dcc decays much more quickly than it should .",
    "the long wavelength dcc is decaying not via interaction with the stochastic heat bath but via its interactions with modes which we are treating classically .",
    "we are therefore able to evaluate the temperature below which our classical langevin field equation should not be used to model the dynamics .",
    "our analysis complements that in several previous papers .",
    "greiner and mller  @xcite and rischke  @xcite have derived effective langevin equations by integrating out hard modes perturbatively and found that these typically include correlated and multiplicative sources of noise and dissipation .",
    "xu and greiner  @xcite then explored the effects of such noise and dissipation on @xmath9-dimensional dynamics .",
    "this treatment of the noise goes beyond ours , since we treat the heat bath as an uncorrelated source of fluctuation .",
    "however , whereas @xmath9-dimensional calculations ( like those of refs .",
    "@xcite ) treat the dynamics of only one mode explicitly and thus assume spatial homogeneity , our @xmath10-dimensional langevin equation allows an analysis of more realistic , spatially varying , configurations .",
    "the @xmath10-dimensional langevin equation has been introduced previously by chaudhuri  @xcite , although as he notes in ref .",
    "@xcite all of his results depend sensitively on his choice of lattice spacing .",
    "we introduce the correct @xmath6-dependent counterterms in order to obtain results at long wavelengths which are independent of the lattice - spacing .",
    "randrup has addressed the linear sigma model dynamics in a series of papers , using either the classical theory or a hartree approximation  @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown the importance of accounting correctly for the multidimensional expansion of the hot system , and have provided initial answers to some of the questions we wish to investigate .",
    "the stochastic linear sigma model we develop below has the relative advantage of having dynamics which equilibrate at late times in the absence of expansion and in addition allows us to take some account of the effects of shorter wavelength degrees of freedom on the longer wavelength modes we treat classically .    in section",
    "ii we describe the model , paying close attention to the counterterms which are needed in order to ensure that the long wavelength physics is not divergent as the lattice spacing is taken to zero . in section iii",
    ", we evaluate the order parameter as a function of temperature and fix the most important finite counterterms by enforcing agreement with chiral perturbation theory at low temperature and with lattice gauge theory calculations of the critical temperature .",
    "we also evaluate the temperature - dependent pion and sigma masses . in section iv",
    ", we analyze the decay of a dcc . by comparing the dcc lifetime",
    "we obtain to that calculated previously by other methods , we fix the viscosity @xmath8 in the langevin equation , which couples the classical fields to the heat bath .",
    "we also determine the temperature below which a classical field treatment fails to describe the dynamics correctly .",
    "we close in section v with a look towards the future .",
    "at low temperatures , the correct effective field theory for qcd is the nonlinear sigma model , describing the dynamics of the pseudoscalar pions . at the qcd phase transition ,",
    "however , chiral symmetry is approximately restored and the scalar sigma becomes approximately degenerate with the pions .",
    "these four degrees of freedom are the lightest in qcd near its finite temperature phase transition . indeed ,",
    "if the up and down quarks were massless , these four modes would all be massless at @xmath5 , making the transition an @xmath11 second order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculations suggest that with quark masses as in nature , these modes have inverse correlation lengths which are comparable to @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this means that although these modes are still the lightest degrees of freedom , the classical treatment we employ is at or beyond the limit of its regime of validity .",
    "two asides should be noted at this point .",
    "first , at the @xmath2 at which there is a second order critical point in the qcd phase transition , the sigma becomes massless while the pions do not .",
    "second , there have been recent suggestions that the lightest scalar glueball may play an interesting role at the transition  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculations show that this has a correlation length close to @xmath12  @xcite , much shorter than that of the pion  @xcite , and we therefore neglect it .    writing the pions and the sigma as an @xmath11 vector @xmath13",
    ", the linear sigma model lagrangian is given by @xmath14 with summation over repeated indices implied .",
    "the context in which this is of precise validity is two - flavor qcd in the chiral limit , on the assumption that this theory has a second order phase transition , as is consistent with what we know from lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "then , that transition is in the same @xmath11 universality class as the second order phase transition found at nonzero temperature in the theory ( [ lagrangian ] ) with @xmath15  @xcite . the explicit symmetry breaking term @xmath16 , the coupling @xmath17 , and the vacuum expectation value @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of the phenomenological parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath19 at tree level via @xmath20 we take @xmath21  mev , meaning @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the simplest langevin prescription corresponds to including additive stochastic sources @xmath25 and dissipation terms in the euler - lagrange equations of motion for the fields : @xmath26 the stochastic fields @xmath27 are taken to obey the fluctuation - dissipation relations @xmath28 with @xmath29 . in this paper",
    ", we shall always choose @xmath30 .",
    "this dynamics reduces to the classical microcanonical relativistic evolution for the pions and sigma in the limit of small dissipation @xmath31 . in the limit of vanishing masses",
    "the long wavelength modes of the fields are effectively overdamped , and suffer critical slowing down  @xcite .",
    "then our equations correspond to model a , in the classification of dynamical stochastic theories of hohenberg and halperin  @xcite .",
    "although model a will be adequate for our purposes , a complete analysis of the universal @xmath11 dynamics in the chiral limit of qcd requires coupling the order parameter ( which is not conserved ) to other conserved quantities in the theory , as in hohenberg and halperin s model g  @xcite .    for any nonzero value of @xmath8 , at late times ( @xmath32 )",

    "when compared to the quantum partition function it fails to account for the correct statistical weighting of hard particles ( with typical momentum @xmath35 ) and at low temperatures , when ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we will return to the latter point in the next section .",
    "the classical statistical weighting of hard modes in the equilibrium state leads to ultraviolet divergences ( as the lattice spacing @xmath37 is taken to zero ) of certain expectation values at nonzero temperature .",
    "this effect is an incorrect prediction of the classical partition function .",
    "fortunately it can be compensated for .",
    "the idea is to subtract the divergent terms , which are all perturbative and can therefore be identified diagrammatically .",
    "these are then replaced by the corresponding correct contributions , identified through the computation of the same diagram using quantum statistical distributions .    for the linear sigma model in three dimensions , there are only two divergent diagrams , shown in fig .",

    "these are self - energy contributions : the tadpole diagram at one loop and the sunset diagram at two loops  @xcite .",

    "the calculation is only quantitatively valid below @xmath5 , but we have plotted the results up to higher temperatures also .    below we shall choose @xmath1 to match the decay time @xmath122 of a spatially homogeneous dcc in our langevin evolution to the values calculated by steele and koch .",
    "first , however , let us see what we obtain with @xmath146 , as in fig .",
    "[ taus_lowt ] .",
    "that is , we first thermalize at a given temperature , add a dcc , and then set @xmath146 thus removing the classical fields from further contact with any heat bath . in so doing , however , we do not remove all sources of dissipation .",
    "the long wavelength dcc still decays , by virtue of its coupling to those finite wavelength modes which we are treating classically .",
    "that is , the dcc decays via contact with an effective classical heat bath , present even for @xmath146 .",
    "we see that at low temperatures the resulting @xmath147 turns out to be smaller than the desired @xmath122 , namely that due to contact with a gas of hadrons .",
    "the reason is that @xmath122 becomes very large at low temperatures , due to the exponential suppression of the thermal occupation numbers in the ( quantum ) gas of hadrons .",
    "the classical thermal field theory overestimates the occupation numbers , and thus the dissipation , leading to an underestimate of @xmath111 .",
    "note that we have checked that our calculation of @xmath148 is independent of the lattice spacing @xmath37 . as shown in fig .  5 ,",
    "we have compared results obtained on a @xmath99 lattice with @xmath73 to those obtained on a @xmath100 lattice with @xmath74 .",
    "as described in the previous section , the ultraviolet - finite counterterms must be chosen differently in these two cases in order that the equilibrium behavior of the order parameter is the same in both cases . with the counterterms",
    "so adjusted , @xmath147 changes little with @xmath46 .",
    "the shape of @xmath147 , shown in fig .",
    "[ taus_lowt ] , is interesting and may be understood as follows .",
    "@xmath147 should grow like @xmath149 as @xmath150 ( whereas @xmath111 grows much more rapidly in this limit ) .",
    "we do find that @xmath148 rises at the lowest temperatures we have explored .",
    "the minimum of @xmath148 coincides with the minimum value of the ratio @xmath151 , which occurs at @xmath152  mev .",
    "this means that the classical thermal pions are most numerous in this temperature regime , making it plausible that the classical dissipation is largest and @xmath148 is smallest .",
    "we now see the challenge posed by our use of a classical theory , with its intrinsic decay time @xmath147 . by turning on a nonzero @xmath8",
    ", we can only add dissipation .",
    "this means that we can only reduce @xmath111 , relative to @xmath147 . at temperatures where @xmath153 ,",
    "therefore , there is no way to use our langevin equation to reproduce the correct dynamics of the decay of a dcc .",
    "thus , we find that our model can only be used to describe the long wavelength dynamics in the presence of a heat bath with @xmath154 mev , corresponding to about 80% of the crossover temperature @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath155 mev is large enough that the assumptions in the calculation of @xmath111 as in ref .",
    "@xcite may be starting to break down , which means that our estimate of the limit of validity of our analysis may have a little play in it .",
    "however , the fundamental fact that @xmath111 should rise rapidly with decreasing temperature while @xmath148 does not is incontrovertible .    above @xmath156",
    "mev , we can proceed as planned .",
    "we can choose an @xmath1 in such a way as to reproduce the predictions of steele and koch , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "the required @xmath1 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ etas ] , where it is also compared to the @xmath1 of eq .",
    "( [ rischkeeta ] ) , calculated perturbatively by rischke  @xcite .",
    "we see ( from both figs .",
    "[ taus ] and [ etas ] ) that introducing the perturbatively calculated @xmath1 into the langevin equation is not sufficient to obtain a dcc decay timescale @xmath122 in agreement with that induced via contact with a thermal hadron gas . from ( [ rischkeeta ] ) to yield too rapid or too slow dissipation . on the one hand",
    ", we may have expected that use of the perturbative @xmath1 in the langevin equation would yield excess dissipation , as there is always classical dissipation in addition . on the other hand , we may have expected that it would introduce insufficient dissipation , as its calculation neglects the effects of all hadrons in the heat bath except the pions and sigma . ]",
    "both the calculations of rischke and of steele and koch are only of quantitative validity below @xmath5 , as they use zero temperature masses and interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancy between the @xmath1 s in the vicinity of @xmath5 is sufficiently large that we take this to mean that , for @xmath124 , the perturbative calculation underpredicts @xmath8 .",
    "we have shown how to use a stochastic classical linear sigma model to obtain a reasonable description of the equilibrium thermodynamics and the long - wavelength near - equilibrium dynamics of qcd at temperatures of order that of its phase transition .",
    "the use of any classical statistical field theory around the chiral transition can not be quantitatively justified , because there are no excitations with masses which are very small compared to the temperature .",
    "nevertheless , we have determined the choice of divergent counterterms needed to remove the ultraviolet divergences from the classical linear sigma model , making the long distance physics described therein independent of the lattice spacing .",
    "we have then been able to find the finite counterterms needed in order for the equilibrium temperature dependence of the order parameter in the linear sigma model to be as in qcd at low temperatures , as calculated in chiral perturbation theory , and for @xmath5 to be as in qcd , as calculated in lattice gauge theory .",
    "the temperature dependence of the pion and sigma masses then come out nicely in accord with expectations .",
    "we have then fixed @xmath1 such that the timescale for the dissipation of a dcc in our langevin model agrees with that calculated previously .",
    "the main constraint on our model is that it can not be used at low temperatures , where the classical dissipation is too great even when @xmath8 is set to zero .",
    "we find that this limits its use to temperatures above about 80% that of the crossover transition itself . above this temperature ,",
    "we show how to choose @xmath1 in such a way that the long wavelength dynamics of the pions and sigma should be reproduced reasonably well in our model , at least as long as the system is not too far out of thermal equilibrium .    in this work ,",
    "we have used the dynamics of an idealized dcc as a device with which to normalize our model . in subsequent work",
    ", we shall use the now normalized model to investigate the dynamical setting where the system expands and cools through its chiral crossover transition .",
    "we hope to determine with some confidence how fast the expansion and cooling must be in order for the dynamics to be driven significantly from equilibrium .",
    "we will then follow the nonequilibrium long wavelength evolution for as long as occupation numbers remain reasonably high . unlike in the idealized",
    "setting utilized for convenience in this paper and in the analytic computations of @xmath1 , the long wavelength modes will certainly not describe a spatially uniform condensate .",
