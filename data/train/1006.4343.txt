    "[ [ section ] ]    in the paper  @xcite published in 1987 , a.  beilinson formulated his famous conjectures on the properties of hypothetical categories of mixed motivic sheaves over a scheme .",
    "in addition to the classical case of motives with rational coefficients , some conjectures about the category of motives with a finite coefficient ring  @xmath0 were proposed there .",

    "beilinson predicted existence of abelian categories of mixed motives ; the triangulated categories now known would then be equivalent to the derived categories of those abelian categories .",

    "the former condition amounts to the existence of _ canonical filtrations _ on the objects of @xmath6 with subquotients in @xmath13 , while the latter condition is equivalent to the existence of _ silly filtrations_. as to the problem of existence of a triangulated functor from @xmath14 to @xmath6 , it can be viewed independently of the choice of the subcategory @xmath7 as arising solely from shortcomings of the notion of a triangulated category per se .",

    "the former filtration is increasing when @xmath22  increases , while the latter one is decreasing ; the successive quotients of the former filtration are the cohomology objects @xmath23 , while the successive quotients of the latter one are the terms  @xmath24 of the complex  @xmath19 .",
    "the canonical filtration owes its name to the fact that it does not depend on the choice of a particular complex inside a given quasi - isomorphism class and therefore is uniquely ( and functorially ) defined on objects of the derived category  @xmath25 .",
    "the silly filtration on an object of the derived category is not unique ; nevertheless , it is sensible to ask about its existence .",
    "a typical example when the canonical filtrations do exist , but the silly filtrations may not is the following one .",

    "then one can see that the silly filtrations exist in @xmath27 if and only if the natural functor @xmath28 is an equivalence of categories , which means that the @xmath8 groups between the objects of  @xmath13 computed in the larger category  @xmath26 should coincide with those computed in  @xmath13 . on the other hand",

    "this functor is an equivalence of triangulated categories if and only if the t - structure is of the derived type , i.  e. , the silly filtrations , or @xmath8 decomposition , condition holds .",
    "this answers , in theory , our question when a triangulated category is equivalent to the derived category of an abelian category .",
    "notice the difference between our silly filtrations and the `` weight structures '' of bondarko  @xcite : the orthogonality condition from the definition in  @xcite is not assumed , and does not hold , in the situations considered in this paper .",
    "indeed , the question of existence of silly filtrations on objects of a triangulated category with respect to a generating full subcategory ( closed under extensions ) that we are interested in here becomes trivial when the orthogonality , i.  e. , the vanishing of @xmath15)$ ] for @xmath10 , @xmath30 and @xmath33 , is assumed .",

    "let us note that even if the abelian category of arbitrary mixed motives does exist , the condition that the @xmath8 spaces between the tate objects computed in this large abelian category coincide with those with respect to the abelian category of mixed tate motives is still highly nontrivial .",

    "<S> the goal of this paper is to give an explicit description of the triangulated categories of tate and artin  tate motives with finite coefficients @xmath0 over a field @xmath1 containing a primitive @xmath2-root of unity as the derived categories of exact categories of filtered modules over the absolute galois group of @xmath1 with certain restrictions on the successive quotients . </S>",
    "<S> this description is conditional upon ( and its validity is equivalent to ) certain koszulity hypotheses about the milnor k - theory / galois cohomology of  @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this paper also purports to explain what it means for an arbitrary nonnegatively graded ring to be koszul . </S>",
    "<S> tate motives with integral coefficients are discussed in the `` conclusions '' section . </S>"
