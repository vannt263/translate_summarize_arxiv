    "one of the most fundamental problems of nuclear physics is to derive the force between two nucleons from first principles .",
    "a great obstacle for the solution of this problem has been the fact that the fundamental theory of strong interaction , qcd , is nonperturbative in the low - energy regime characteristic for nuclear physics .",
    "the way out of this dilemma is paved by the effective field theory concept which recognizes different energy scales in nature . below the chiral symmetry breaking scale , @xmath3 gev , the appropriate degrees of freedom are pions and nucleons interacting via a force that is governed by the symmetries of qcd , particularly , ( broken ) chiral symmetry .",
    "the derivation of the nuclear force from chiral effective field theory was initiated by weinberg @xcite and pioneered by ordez @xcite and van kolck @xcite .",
    "subsequently , many researchers became interested in the field @xcite .",
    "as a result , efficient methods for deriving the nuclear force from chiral lagrangians emerged  @xcite and the quantitative nature of the chiral nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) potential improved  @xcite .",
    "current @xmath2 potentials  @xcite and phase shift analyses  @xcite include @xmath4-exchange contributions up to order three in small momenta ( next - to - next - to - leading order , nnlo )",
    ". however , the contribution at order three is very large , several times the one at order two ( nlo ) .",
    "this fact raises serious questions concerning the convergence of the chiral expansion for the two - nucleon problem .",
    "moreover , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a _ quantitative _ chiral @xmath2 potential requires contact terms of order four .",
    "consistency then implies that also @xmath4 ( and @xmath5 ) contributions are to be included up to order four .    for the reasons discussed ,",
    "it is a timely project to investigate the chiral @xmath4 exchange contribution to the @xmath2 interaction at order four .",
    "recently , kaiser  @xcite has derived the analytic expressions at this order using covariant perturbation theory and dimensional regularization .",
    "it is the chief purpose of this paper to apply these contributions in peripheral @xmath2 scattering and compare the predictions to empirical phase shifts as well as to the results from conventional meson theory .",
    "furthermore , we will investigate the above - mentioned convergence issue .",
    "our calculations provide a sound basis to discuss the question whether the low - energy constants ( lecs ) determined from @xmath1 lead to reasonable predictions in @xmath2 .    in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize the lagrangians involved in the evaluation of the @xmath4-exchange contributions presented in sec .  iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we explain how we calculate the phase shifts for peripheral partial waves and present results . sec .",
    "v concludes the paper .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian relevant to our problem can be written as  @xcite , @xmath6 where the superscript refers to the number of derivatives or pion mass insertions ( chiral dimension ) and the ellipsis stands for terms of chiral order four or higher .    _ at lowest / leading order _ ,",

    "the fundamental rule by which this lagrangian  as well as all the other ones  are assembled is that they must contain _ all _ terms consistent with chiral symmetry and lorentz invariance ( apart from the other trivial symmetries ) at a given chiral dimension ( here : order two ) .",

    "similar to the order two case , the hb projected lagrangian at order three can be broken into two pieces , @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 given in refs.@xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian presented in the previous section is the crucial ingredient for the evaluation of the pion - exchange contributions to the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) interaction .",
    "since we are dealing here with a low - energy effective theory , it is appropriate to analyze the diagrams in terms of powers of small momenta : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 stands for a momentum ( nucleon three - momentum or pion four - momentum ) or a pion mass and @xmath3 gev is the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "this procedure has become known as power counting . for non - iterative contributions to the @xmath2 interaction ( i.  e. , irreducible graphs with four external nucleon legs ) , the power @xmath36 of a diagram is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the number of loops in the diagram , @xmath39 the number of derivatives or pion - mass insertions and @xmath40 the number of nucleon fields involved in vertex @xmath41 ; the sum runs over all vertices @xmath41 contained in the diagram under consideration .    at order zero ( @xmath42 , lowest order , leading order , lo )",

    "the divergences that occur in conjunction with the four - dimensional loop integrals are treated by means of dimensional regularization , a prescription which is consistent with chiral symmetry and power counting .",

    "@xcite asserts that @xmath219 gev@xmath216 is implied by the @xmath2 phase shifts .",
    "the two values differ by more than 400% which is reason for deep concern .    in fig  [ fig_3f4 ]",
    ", we show the predictions at order four for the three values for @xmath192 under debate .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath199 as representative example of a peripheral partial wave since it has a rather large contribution from @xmath4 exchange . moreover",
    ", the lec @xmath193 is ineffective in @xmath199 such that differences in the choices for @xmath193 do not distort the picture in this partial wave .",
    "this fact makes @xmath199 special for the discussion of @xmath192 .",
    "figure  [ fig_3f4 ] reveals that the chiral @xmath4 exchange depends most sensitively on @xmath192 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the nijmegen choice @xmath220 gev@xmath216  @xcite leads to too much attraction , while the value @xmath221 gev@xmath216 , advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , is far too small ( in terms of magnitude ) since it results in an almost vanishing @xmath4 exchange contribution  quite in contrast to the empirical @xmath2 facts , the dispersion theoretic result , and the bonn model .",
    "one reason for the difference between the nijmegen value and ours could be that their analysis is conducted at n@xmath222lo , while we go to n@xmath0lo .",
    "however , as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig_f]-[fig_h ] , n@xmath0lo is not that different from n@xmath222lo and , therefore , not the main reason for the difference .",
    "more crucial is the fact that , in the nijmegen analysis , the chiral @xmath4 exchange potential , represented as local @xmath223-space function , is cutoff at @xmath224 fm ( i.  e. , it is set to zero for @xmath225 fm )  @xcite .",
    "this cutoff suppresses the @xmath4 contribution , also , in peripheral waves .",
    "if the @xmath4 potential is suppressed by phenomenology then , of course , stronger values for @xmath192 are necessary , resulting in a highly model - dependent determination of @xmath192 .",
    "for example , if we multiply all non - iterative @xmath4 contributions by @xmath226 $ ] with @xmath227 mev and @xmath228 , then with @xmath229 gev@xmath216 we obtain a good reproduction of the peripheral partial wave phase shifts .",
    "note that @xmath227 mev is roughly equivalent to a @xmath223-space cutoff of about 0.5 fm , which is not even close to the cutoff used in the nijmegen analysis .",
    "in fact , the nijmegen @xmath223-space cutoff of @xmath224 fm is equivalent to a momentum - space cutoff @xmath230 which is bound to kill the @xmath4 exchange contribution ( which has a momentum - space range of @xmath231 and larger ) . to revive it ,",
    "unrealistically large parameters are necessary .    the motivation underlying the value for @xmath192 advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , is quite different from the nijmegen scenario . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath192 was adjusted to the @xmath232 waves of @xmath2 scattering , which are notoriously too attractive . with their choice , @xmath233 ,",
    "the @xmath232 waves are , indeed , about right , whereas the @xmath61 waves are drastically underpredicted .",
    "this violates an important rule : _ the higher the partial , the higher the priority .",
    "_ the reason for this rule is that we have more trust in the long - range contributions to the nuclear force than in the short - range ones . the @xmath206 + @xmath4 contributions to the nuclear force rule the @xmath61 and higher partial waves , not the @xmath232 waves .",
    "if @xmath232 waves do not come out right , then one can think of plenty of short - range contributions to fix it .",
    "if @xmath61 and higher partial waves are wrong , there is no fix .    in summary ,",
    "a realistic choice for the important lec @xmath192 is -3.4 gev@xmath216 and one may deliberately assign an uncertainty of @xmath234% to this value .",

    "the @xmath83 corrections [ difference between curves ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ] are typically small .",
    "finally , the two - loop contributions create substantial repulsion in @xmath198 and @xmath197 which brings @xmath198 into good agreement with the data while causing a discrepancy for @xmath197 . in @xmath201 and @xmath199 , there are large cancelations between the ` pure ' two - loop graphs and the @xmath110 terms , making the net two - loop contribution rather small .    a pivotal role in the above game is played by @xmath237 , eq .",
    "( [ eq_4cms ] ) , from the @xmath80 group .",
    "this attractive term receives a factor nine in @xmath198 , a factor @xmath238 in @xmath197 , and a factor one in @xmath201 and @xmath199 .",
    "thus , this contribution is very attractive in @xmath198 and repulsive in @xmath197 .",
    "the latter is the reason for the overcompensation of the @xmath78 graph by the @xmath80 contribution in @xmath197 which is why the final n3lo result in this partial wave comes out too repulsive .",
    "one can expect that @xmath15 corrections that occur at order five or six will resolve this problem .    before finishing this appendix , we like to point out that the problem with the @xmath197 is not as dramatic as it may appear from the phase shift plots  for two reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath197 phase shifts are about one order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath61 and most of the other @xmath107 phases .",
    "thus , in absolute terms , the discrepancies seen in @xmath197 are small . in a certain sense",
    ", we are looking at ` higher order noise ' under a magnifying glass .",
    "second , the @xmath197 partial wave contributes 0.06 mev to the energy per nucleon in nuclear matter , the total of which is @xmath239 mev .",
    "consequently , small discrepancies in the reproduction of @xmath197 by a @xmath2 interaction model will have negligible influence on the microscopic nuclear structure predictions obtained with that model .",
