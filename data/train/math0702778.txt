    "we present a numerical study of the semi - classical solutions to the following nonlinear schrdinger equations with @xmath0 , @xmath1 when a caustic ( a point or a cusp ) is formed , that is to say , beyond _ breakup time_. since the nonlinearity is homogeneous , the change of unknown function @xmath2 shows that is equivalent to : @xmath3 so that we can always consider initial data of order @xmath4 .",
    "there are several motivations to study the behavior of when a caustic is formed .",
    "first , on a purely academic level , we recall that the description of the caustic crossing is complete in the case of linear equations ; see @xcite . for nonlinear equations ,",
    "very interesting formal computations were proposed in @xcite ( we recall the main idea in section  [ sec : analyt ] below ) . for _ dissipative _ nonlinear wave equations , joly , mtivier and rauch @xcite have proved that the amplification of the wave near the caustic can ignite the dissipation phenomenon in such a way that the oscillations ( that carry highest energy ) are absorbed .",
    "the above nonlinear schrdinger equation is the simplest model of a _ conservative , nonlinear equation_. the mass and the energy of the solution are independent of time ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , different nonlinear mechanisms are expected .",
    "we recall in section  [ sec : analyt ] some results that have been established rigorously , and give heuristic arguments to extend these results .",
    "this serves as a guideline for the numerical experiments proposed after .",
    "second , may be considered as a simplified model for bose ",
    "einstein condensation , which may be modeled ( see e.g. @xcite ) by : @xmath5 with @xmath6 if @xmath7 , and @xmath8 if @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the power @xmath11 in front of the nonlinearity depends on the rgime considered , and in particular on the respective scales of different parameters ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the role of the harmonic potential @xmath12 is to model a magnetic trap . in the semi - classical limit @xmath13 for the linear equation , this potential causes focusing at the origin for solutions whose data are independent of @xmath14 .",
    "this is to be compared with the case of with initial quadratic oscillations as considered below : the initial quadratic oscillations force the solution to concentrate at one point in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "the parallel between and was extended and justified in @xcite for these nonlinear equations .    from both points of view , when a caustic point is formed , the caustic crossing may be described in terms of the scattering operator associated to @xmath16 this aspect is recalled in section  [ sec : analyt ] . for this reason",
    ", we also pay a particular attention to this operator , independently of the above semi - classical limit .",
    "note that besides the existence of this operator , very few of its properties ( dynamical , for instance ) are known .    in this paper , we always assume @xmath17 : one of the reasons is that when @xmath18 , instability occurs , see @xcite .",
    "suppose for instance that @xmath19 solves , and that @xmath20 solves , where @xmath21 replaced by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a sequence of real numbers going to zero as @xmath15 .",
    "then there are some choices of @xmath23 for which @xmath24 for some sequence of time @xmath25 ( see @xcite , and @xcite for a similar phenomenon with different initial data ) .",
    "therefore , producing reliable numerical tests in the case @xmath18 ( which is super - critical as far as wkb analysis is concerned @xcite ) seems to be a very delicate issue , that we leave out in the present paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "analyt ] , we recall the general approach of wkb analysis for the schrdinger equation , the arguments of @xcite , and the rigorous results available for the semi - classical limit of when a caustic reduced to a point is formed .",
    "we then recall the definition of the scattering operator .",
    "we also give heuristic arguments to tackle the case of a `` supercritical focal point '' , and to guess what the critical indices are when a cusp caustic is formed , instead of a focal point . in section  [ sec :",
    "numgen ] , we present the different strategies that have been followed in the literature to study numerically the semi - classical limit for nonlinear schrdinger equations .",
    "numerical experiments on the semi - classical limit for in the presence of a focal point appear in section  [ sec : foc ] , and the scattering operator is simulated in section  [ sec : scattnum ] .",
    "we present the numerical experiments of the semi - classical limit for in the presence of a cusp caustic in section  [ sec : cusp ] , and make conclusive remarks in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "consider the initial value problem , for @xmath26 : @xmath27 the aim of wkb methods is to describe the asymptotic behavior of @xmath28 as @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , @xmath14 can be related to the planck constant , and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath28 is expected to yield a good description of @xmath28 when @xmath14 is fixed , but small compared to the other parameters .",
    "more precisely , seek @xmath28 of the form @xmath29 plugging this expansion into and canceling the @xmath30 term , we see that the phase @xmath31 must solve the eikonal equation : @xmath32 to cancel the @xmath33 term , the leading order amplitude solves the transport equation : @xmath34 the eikonal equation is solved thanks to hamilton - jacobi theory : @xmath31 is constructed locally in space and time ( see e.g. @xcite for a discussion on this aspect ) .",
    "even if @xmath35 is smooth , @xmath31 develops singularities in finite time in general : the locus where @xmath31 is singular is called _ caustic _ ( see e.g. the second volume of @xcite ) . when @xmath31 becomes singular",
    ", all the terms @xmath36 may become singular as well .",
    "one easily observes that ( [ eq : transport ] ) admits a  divergence form \" : @xmath37 . to illustrate this general discussion , we consider two examples that will organize the rest of this paper .",
    "+ _ example ( quadratic phase ) .",
    "_ let @xmath38 . then and",
    "can be solved explicitly : @xmath39 this shows that as @xmath40 , @xmath31 and @xmath41 become singular : the wave @xmath19 focuses at the origin .",
    "this example can be viewed as the smooth counterpart of the cauchy problem @xmath42 fourier analysis shows that @xmath43 , the dirac measure at the origin .",
    "+ of course , the solution of can be represented as an oscillatory integral : @xmath44 the caustic set is exactly the locus where the critical points for the phase @xmath45 are degenerate . outside the caustic ,",
    "an approximation of @xmath28 is given by the stationary phase theorem ( that we recalled as simply as possible in @xcite ) .",
    "this leads us to the second example we shall consider numerically : + _ example ( cusp ) .",
    "_ let @xmath7 and @xmath46 .",
    "the set of degenerate critical points for @xmath47 ( caustic ) is given implicitly by : @xmath48 as soon as @xmath49 , a caustic is formed ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "+ when considering the asymptotic behavior of @xmath19 beyond the caustic , two main features must be considered : the creation of other phases , and goes to infinity as @xmath13 - rapid oscillations .",
    "the wavelength may be proportional to @xmath14 , or , say , to @xmath50 .",
    "] , and the maslov index ( see @xcite for more general linear equations ) . in the case of a focal point",
    ", the first aspect does not exist : there is no creation of phase , and one phase is enough to describe @xmath28 past the focal point @xmath51 .",
    "one can prove easily the following result :    [ lem1 ] let @xmath52 and @xmath53 . if @xmath54 , then the asymptotic behavior ( in @xmath55 ) of the solution @xmath28 to is given by : @xmath56    in this example , the maslov index is @xmath57 . in the case of the cusp",
    ", three phases must be considered to describe the asymptotic behavior of @xmath28 beyond the caustic ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ for future discussion on the numerical results , we state the following more precise result , which follows from the stationary phase theorem :    [ lem2 ] let @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath54 , then the asymptotic behavior of the solution @xmath28 to at time @xmath58 is given by : @xmath59      consider now the perturbation of with a nonlinear term : @xmath60 the sign of the nonlinearity is chosen so that no finite time blow - up occurs",
    ". the following two important quantities are formally independent of time : @xmath61 we refer to @xcite for a justification .",
    "fix the power @xmath62 of the nonlinearity , and consider different values for @xmath63 .",
    "two notions of criticality arise : for the wkb methods on the one hand , and for the caustic crossing on the other hand .",
    "this discussion is presented in @xcite for conservation laws , and we summarize it in the case of . plugging an expansion of the form into , we see that the value @xmath64 is critical for the wkb methods : if @xmath65 , then the nonlinearity does not affect the transport equation ( `` linear propagation '' ) , while if @xmath64 , then the nonlinearity appears in the right hand side of ( `` nonlinear propagation '' ) .",
    "recall that in this paper , we always assume @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the eikonal equation is not altered : the geometry of the propagation remains the same as in the linear wkb approach , and we have to face the same caustic sets .",
    "the idea presented in @xcite consists in saying that according to the geometry of the caustic , different notions of criticality exist , as far as @xmath63 is concerned , near the caustic . in the linear setting",
    ", the influence of the caustic is relevant only in a neighborhood of this set ( essentially , in a boundary layer whose size depends on @xmath14 and the geometry of @xmath67 ) .",
    "view the nonlinearity in as a potential , and assume that the nonlinear effects are negligible near the caustic : then @xmath68 near @xmath67 .",
    "view the term @xmath69 as a ( nonlinear ) potential .",
    "the average nonlinear effect near @xmath67 is expected to be : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the region where caustic effects are relevant , and the factor @xmath72 is due to the integration in time ( recall that there is an @xmath14 in front of the time derivative in ) .",
    "the idea of this heuristic argument is that when the nonlinear effects are negligible near @xmath67 ( in the sense that the uniform norm of @xmath73 is small compared to that of @xmath28 near @xmath71 ) , the above approximation should be valid . on the other hand",
    ", it is expected that it ceases to be valid precisely when nonlinear effects can no longer be neglected near the caustic : @xmath73 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath28 in @xmath74 , or even larger .    practically , assume that in the linear case , @xmath28 has an amplitude @xmath75 in a boundary layer of size @xmath76 ; then the above quantity is @xmath77 the value @xmath78 is then critical when the above cumulated effects are not negligible : @xmath79 when @xmath80 , the nonlinear effects are expected to be negligible near the caustic : resuming the terminology of @xcite , we speak of `` linear caustic '' .",
    "the case @xmath81 is called `` nonlinear caustic '' . to conclude this paragraph",
    ", we examine this approach in the case of our two examples . in the case of a focal point",
    ", we have @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this leads us to the value : @xmath84 in the case of the cusp in dimension one , we have @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( which can be viewed thanks to the airy function and its asymptotic expansion , see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) , which yields : @xmath87 one aspect of the numerical experiments presented below is to test this notion of criticality in those two examples .      in this paragraph , we assume @xmath88 .",
    "a complete justification of the above discussion is available @xcite : +    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     consider @xmath89 $ ] , which includes the caustic crossing .",

    "we give some precisions in some cases of interest for the numerics presented below .",
    "+ in the one - dimensional case @xmath7 , the following pointwise estimate is proved in @xcite when @xmath94 or @xmath95 : @xmath96 setting @xmath97 , we see that @xmath98 the usual energy estimate yields , for @xmath99 : @xmath100 using , we infer , for @xmath89 $ ] : @xmath101\\}}\\frac{d\\tau}{|\\tau     -1|^\\si}+\\int_{|\\tau-1|\\le \\e}\\frac{d\\tau}{\\e^\\si } \\)\\lesssim    \\e^{\\alpha -\\si}.\\ ] ] using the operator @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and gagliardo  nirenberg inequalities as in @xcite , we find :    [ lem3 ] let @xmath7 , @xmath94 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "then we have , for the solutions of and : @xmath104.\\ ] ] in particular , lemma  [ lem3 ] implies , at time @xmath58 : @xmath105    ( the above result is true also when @xmath106 , but becomes far less interesting . ) we now explain the critical case @xmath92 .",
    "the nonlinear effects near the focal point are described in terms of the scattering operator associated to the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we rapidly present this operator @xmath107 in section  [ sec : scatt ] .",
    "we have then : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the conjugate of @xmath107 by the fourier transform ( see @xcite ) , @xmath110 ( since @xmath107 is a nonlinear operator , the normalization of the fourier transform is an important detail . )    to conclude this paragraph , we give a few hints of what happens or may happen when the propagation is linear , and the caustic is super - critical , that is @xmath111 .",
    "first , the conservation of mass and energy seem to rule out the possibility of a concentration of the form @xmath112 for some function @xmath113 independent of @xmath14 .",
    "the above relation holds for @xmath28 and @xmath19 when @xmath114 , with @xmath115 ( for @xmath28 , this is obvious from ) .",
    "when @xmath92 ( linear propagation and nonlinear focal point ) , the above relation still holds , with a different profile @xmath113 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "now we see that the energy is bounded as @xmath13 : @xmath116 plugging a concentrating profile as in in the second term of the energy would yield , thanks to the conservation of mass : @xmath117 which is impossible since the energy is the sum of two positive terms .",
    "this suggests two possible effects : near @xmath118 , the amplification of the solution ( in terms of powers of @xmath14 ) may be weaker than in the linear case ; on the other hand , nonlinear effects near the caustic should affect the _ phase _ of the solution @xmath19 in a rather strong way , causing the appearance of new frequencies .",
    "a partial justification of the last assertion may be found in @xcite .    extrapolating this argument",
    ", we expect that in the supercritical case for a cusp ( with @xmath7 : @xmath119 ) , new frequencies appear .",
    "if as in the linear case , three phases are necessary to describe the solution past the caustic , then the nonlinear interaction of these phases might reveal the presence of new frequencies , even on the modulus of @xmath19 ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : cusp ] for numerical tests that seem to confirm this heuristics ) .",
    "to explain what the operator @xmath107 mentioned in the previous section is , consider the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the propagator of the linear equation . to construct the scattering operator ,",
    "we first want to give a meaning to  when @xmath122 .",
    "this means that the nonlinear effects are asymptotically negligible as @xmath123 : for instance , we expect at least @xmath124 this gives a rigorous meaning to the relation @xmath125 which aims at saying that as time goes to @xmath126 , the nonlinear dynamics associated to can be compared to the free dynamics given by @xmath127 .    to define a scattering operator , we want to be able to say that as @xmath128 as well , the nonlinear effect are asymptotically negligible",
    "that is , there exists @xmath129 such that @xmath130 the scattering operator is then defined as @xmath131 .",
    "since our numerical experiments concern the one - dimensional case , we recall the existence of the scattering operator in this setting , and refer to @xcite for some extensions to the multidimensional framework : define @xmath132    [ prop : scattering ] let @xmath7 , and assume @xmath133 .    * for every @xmath134 , there exists a unique @xmath135 such that the maximal solution @xmath136 to satisfies @xmath137 and @xmath138 * for every @xmath135 , there exists a unique @xmath139 such that the maximal solution @xmath136 to with @xmath137 satisfies @xmath140    the scattering operator is @xmath141 .",
    "when @xmath142 , the above conclusions remain , in a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "when @xmath143 , we also have :    * for every @xmath144 , there exist a unique solution @xmath145 to and a unique @xmath146 such that : @xmath147    when @xmath148 , the above conclusions are false : if @xmath8 for instance , and if @xmath149 with @xmath150 in @xmath151 as @xmath152 , then @xmath153 .",
    "one can not compare the nonlinear dynamics with the free dynamics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ note that even though the scattering is proven to exist , very few of its features are known .",
    "we refer to @xcite for some algebraic properties .",
    "at least , this operator is not trivial : near the origin , it is a non - trivial perturbation of the identity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hereafter we restrict our discussion to the one - dimensional case , that is to say @xmath7 in all the preceding considerations .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the numerical literature , the nonlinear equation is treated exactly the same way the linear one would be in the presence of a potential @xmath154 on its right - hand side .",
    "the strategy is called _ time - splitting _ , in its first or second order version ( lie or strang splitting , see e.g. @xcite ) where one alternates every time step @xmath155 between the solving of the laplace operator and the handling of the ( nonlinear ) differential equation . according to section [ sec : scatt ]",
    ", @xmath156 will still stand for the free propagator , whereas we shall use @xmath154 as the ode solver ; lie time - splitting algorithms generate the following type of approximation for , @xmath157^n u^\\e(t=0,.),\\ ] ] and strang splittings , @xmath158^{n-1 } v(\\dt/2 ) u^\\e(t=0,.).\\ ] ] many references exist ; let us quote only @xcite .    on the contrary ,",
    "few rigorous convergence results are available , hence we shall mainly recall the results from @xcite which quantify accurately the _ splitting errors _ assuming each time - step is performed exactly . under this assumption , there holds :    ( @xcite , theorem 4.1 ) for any @xmath159 and @xmath160 , there exists a constant @xmath161 depending on the initial data for and @xmath162 , such that for @xmath163 $ ] and @xmath164 , @xmath165 if moreover @xmath166 , then there holds under the same assumptions : @xmath167    this result is concerned with splitting errors only and relies on the knowledge of the exact solution operators @xmath156 and @xmath154 . in order to stick to this framework in the context of smooth solutions , it is rather natural to approximate @xmath156 by means of a fourier scheme taking advantage of optimized fft routines , as proposed in the paper @xcite . moreover",
    ", this will guarantee that the @xmath151 norm ( mass ) of the numerical solution will be conserved up to round - off errors .",
    "unfortunately , the hamiltonian @xmath168 is generally not preserved ; a method conserving both quantities exists ( see the so  called mcn algorithm , page 253 of @xcite ) but it would nt be efficient in the semiclassical regime because of the results in @xcite .",
    "this is the main purpose of the paper @xcite to illustrate the ( surprising ) fact that in semi - classical regime , usual finite - difference schemes for can deliver very wrong approximations without any particular sign of instability in case very restrictive meshing constraints turn out to be bypassed",
    ". this can be quite easily checked through the location of caustics , for instance .",
    "the analysis of those standard schemes has been carried out by means of wigner measures , so the conclusions hold essentially for the quadratic observables coming out of the wave function itself .",
    "this class of schemes became popular after the publication of @xcite , mainly because treating the differential part of ( [ eq : nls ] ) by means of a discrete fourier transform looked very much like being the best possible compromise in terms of meshing constraints .",
    "indeed , in the linear case where ( [ eq : schrodlibre ] ) is supplemented with a potential @xmath169 on its right - hand side , it was shown that the time - step @xmath170 could be chosen independent of @xmath14 whereas the space discretization has to satisfy @xmath171 .",
    "this was already much better when compared to finite - differences ; moreover , the method is naturally @xmath151-conservative . in @xcite",
    ", these authors extended their  fourier framework \" to the weakly nonlinear schrdinger equations of the form ( [ eq : nls ] ) .",
    "however , and despite the fact we do believe these `` fft time - split schemes '' realize the best numerical strategy in terms of gridding , we shall point out some shortcomings of the method in the next section .",
    "we present here a preliminary result about truncation errors in lebesgue spaces for fourier schemes ; its proof follows directly from the strichartz estimates on the torus due to j.  bourgain @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and from the study of fft by m.  taylor @xcite . its derivation is not obvious though as it applies directly to widely - used schemes like the one recalled in the forthcoming section .",
    "we restrict our attention to the 1d free schrdinger equation with @xmath172 , and periodic boundary conditions : @xmath173 .",
    "hence we start from @xmath174.\\ ] ] we have explicitly : @xmath175 in order to investigate the behavior of the fft - scheme involving a finite even number @xmath176 of modes , we introduce the discrete fourier transform of a continuous function @xmath21 on @xmath177 $ ] as follows : @xmath178 from @xcite , we recall :    [ lem_tay]if the continuous function @xmath21 has a convergent fourier series , then : @xmath179    now , what the fourier numerical scheme really computes is : @xmath180 thus the corresponding numerical solution @xmath181 is built : @xmath182 the question is therefore to study the discrepancy between @xmath183 and @xmath181 : @xmath184 the second term @xmath185 in this last equality can be interpreted as a usual truncation error ; it means that some high frequencies in the solution are lost when discretizing the problem on a finite grid . from @xcite , we know that the modulus of this term can be controlled as follows : @xmath186 which is satisfactory provided the initial data @xmath187 is smooth , e.g. @xmath188 .",
    "however , the first term @xmath189 is far more delicate and reveals the propagation of the errors coming from the dft / fft itself .",
    "it can be controlled thanks to the periodic strichartz estimates proved by j.  bourgain . from @xcite , we recall :    [ lem_bou ] given any complex - valued sequence @xmath190 , the following estimates hold for the corresponding functions in @xmath177 \\times [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] : @xmath191    the second estimate looks more attractive as it",
    " sees \" the finite number of modes .",
    "we therefore deduce that the first term can be controlled in @xmath192 by means of : @xmath193 for instance , if @xmath187 is a finite superposition of fourier modes , then it is clear that this term cancels for @xmath194 large enough as @xmath195 in the summation ; obviously , the second term @xmath185 vanishes too .",
    "the general case is nt completely clear yet .",
    "this section aims at visualizing the asymptotics previously recalled ; namely we shall compare numerical approximations of and in 1d ( @xmath7 ) for various values of the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath196 .",

    "it is convenient to observe results in @xmath58 since @xmath199 .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath200 and @xmath201 ; we expect to observe a decay of the absolute errors between @xmath28 and @xmath19 for values @xmath0 .",

    "[ pf1 ] shows even a bit more , namely it compares pointwise the following quantities : ( recall lemma [ lem1 ] ) @xmath202    on the left in fig .",
    "[ pf1 ] , we obviously observe that the absolute errors are slightly bigger when considering the solution of the nonlinear equation , @xmath19 .",
    "however , even for the free solution @xmath28 , one sees that the error does nt vanish despite the fact no time - splitting algorithm is needed . as the way of discretizing the solution reveals itself important , we include here the corresponding scilab routine for the free equation :    clear;deff([y]=phase(x),[y=-0.5*(x-@xmath203)@xmath204 ; ] )    deff([y]=position(x),[y = exp(-2*(x-@xmath203)@xmath204) ] )    deff([y]=az(x),[y = position(x).*exp(i*phase(x)./epsilon) ] )    nmax=2@xmath205;n=-(nmax)/2:(nmax/2)-1;epsilon=1.0/150 ;    xstart=0;xstop=2*@xmath203;dx=(xstop - xstart)/nmax;xstop = xstop - dx ;    a = xstart : dx : xstop , initialdata = az(a ) ;    vepsilon = fftshift(fft(initialdata,-1 ) ) ;    vepsilon = exp(-i*epsilon*(@xmath206)).*vepsilon ;    vepsilon = fft(fftshift(vepsilon),1 ) ;     + clearly , its outcome is in agreement with lemma [ lem1 ] since @xmath14 is already quite small .",
    "the maslov index is visible , up to an error around @xmath207 for 1024 fourier modes .",
    "we now put @xmath208 and the outcome is displayed on fig .",
    "[ pf2 ] ; we still compare the same quantities .",
    "absolute errors on wave functions ( left side ) are much bigger for @xmath19 in this case .",
    "in particular , no new frequencies appear in the numerical solutions .",
    "the nonlinear effect boils down to a small change on the modulus of @xmath19 .",
    "we close this first series of tests by considering @xmath200 and @xmath209 as shown in fig .",
    "[ pf3 ] . of course , as no pointwise convergence is expected in this case , absolute errors are even bigger for both wave functions ( left side ) and moduli ( right side ) .    of course , the size of the error on the modulus is much bigger too , and one should be extremely careful about the credit to give to the numerical simulations in the supercritical case . indeed , this is a regime where a small error can be amplified at leading order ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we aim now at illustrating the results on scattering theory through numerical computations still achieved through time - splitting fft schemes .",
    "the algorithm we used for the approximation of the scattering operator is based on a nonlinear time - splitting routine flanked by two free evolution steps ( implemented the way recalled in the previous section ) : @xmath210 with @xmath156 , @xmath211 standing for the solution operators of equations and in 1-d with @xmath212 respectively .",
    "we used @xmath213 in the computations hereafter .",

    "in all the tests we performed , it was somehow surprising to observe how fast the algorithm converges : one does not have to consider `` very large '' values of @xmath214 so that @xmath218 becomes stable and visually independent of @xmath214 .",
    "the parameter @xmath217 controls in some sense the strength of the nonlinearity inside , as can be seen on fig .",
    "this figure displays the position density of the initial data , the scattered solution for @xmath213 and a  mixed state \" @xmath219 . as our time - splitting / fft algorithm preserves only the @xmath151 norm , but not the hamiltonian , we first restricted ourselves to moderate values of @xmath220 ( defocusing case ) .",
    "however , as a numerical experiment , we wanted to display the outcome of our scheme for the stronger case @xmath221 on fig .",
    "[ run2 ] : notice the change of shape in the scattered solution . moreover , on this figure , we also tried to show what happens for @xmath222 , that is to say for the focusing case despite there may be finite time blow - up ( but there is scattering for small data ) .",
    "we checked that the energy associated to this data is ( and remains ) positive , a case where the virial identity , @xcite , does not imply blow - up .",
    "the computational domain for these runs was @xmath223 $ ] and @xmath224 fourier modes were used .",
    "now let s observe the effects of lowering the @xmath196 value while keeping other parameters equal , see fig .",
    "it is interesting to see that the change of shape appearing for @xmath221 is stronger than in the preceding case . on the contrary ,",
    "the increase of the numerical solution s support is slightly less important .",
    "this hints that increasing the @xmath196 value tends to expand the support of the scattered solution whereas increasing the @xmath226 value ( defocusing case ) leads to an oscillatory behavior .",
    "however , we stress that since the energy , @xmath227 of the numerical solution changes more with a bigger @xmath217 ( its mass being always kept constant ) , these oscillations might be spurious . we actually do nt know how this fact can be decided ; our profiles have been checked to be stable on a finer grid .      in order to get some numerical evidence about the dependence of the scattered solution on @xmath196",
    ", we display on fig .",
    "[ run4 ] the outcome for @xmath228 .",
    "it is quite clear that the scattered solutions for both values of @xmath217 are less peaked .",
    "their support is bigger and the oscillations for @xmath221 are weaker , their frequency remained the same though .",
    "this agrees with the behavior we sketched in the preceding subsection as @xmath196 and @xmath217 vary .",
    "let us now go back to comparing the quadratic observables generated by numerical approximation of equations and endowed with a small parameter @xmath14 in 1-d . in this section we fixed @xmath229 .",
    "figure [ run - cusp ] displays the position density of the initial data for both equations , i.e. @xmath230,\\ ] ] together with the position density of the numerical approximations of , in @xmath231 .",
    "the point here is to investigate what happens for the case of such a self - interfering gaussian pulse , since no scattering theory is known for this problem .",
    "what we would like to check is whether the theoretical results on the focus point recalled and visualized in the preceding sections can be thought of as a guideline for this more complex case involving a non - trivial caustic",
    ".    we shall observe position densities for the unique value of @xmath232 as a similar behavior has been seen to hold for different nonlinearities with convenient values of @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath233 fourier modes have been used in order to produce these results .",
    "this case could be referred to as subcritical since it is noticeable on the top of fig .",
    "[ run - cusp ] that the free and the nonlinear numerical solutions do agree for this reasonably small value of @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the frequencies of oscillations are identical .",
    "this is very similar compared to the behavior investigated in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 is now in a",
    " critical range \" as we observe that both solutions differ much more , but the frequency of the oscillations looks like being still the same in both cases . in order to establish this fact , we display on the left of fig.[fft - cusp ] the fft of the position densities : a peak at the same frequency is clearly noticeable .",
    "the nonlinear effect manifests itself through a change of order zero in the moduli , as we already observed on the right side of fig .",

    "[ run2 ] ( right ) .",
    "this does agree with the @xmath236 value derived in section [ sec : heur ]      in this last case , there is no similarity no more between the approximate solutions of , , as seen on both fig .",
    "[ run - cusp ] and [ fft - cusp ] . especially , the right side of fig .",
    "[ fft - cusp ] reveals that new frequencies show up inside the position density of the nonlinear solution .",
    "we have therefore a change of order zero in the moduli and in the frequency .",
    "this is of course reminiscent of fig .",

    "however in the critical case , described by a nonlinear scattering operator , the leading order nonlinear effects are rather hard to visualize in the semi - classical limit .",
    "this is why we simulated the scattering operator in a separate way .",
    "our numerical tests give encouraging evidence of new phenomena concerning the phase of the wave in the supercritical case when a focal point is formed ( appearance of new frequencies ) . in the presence of a cusp caustic , the numerical experiments are in good agreement with the heuristic arguments that we presented here , for which no rigorous justification is available so far .",
