    "the use of a cut power - law in high energy physics was first introduced by r.  hagedorn @xcite , describing the data of the invariant cross section of hadrons as a function of @xmath0 over a wide range .    in order to gain an improved insight into this generalized non - extensive statistics , as well as to value its application to @xmath0 spectra on the top of pqcd motivated power - laws , ever used for high - energy jets , the meaning of its key parameter , @xmath5 ,",
    "must inevitably be studied .",
    "considering the thermodynamical properties of hot and dense nuclear matter formed in heavy - ion collisions , on the other hand it is worth to study the fluctuations of the relevant physical observables , with a large number of particles produced .",
    "for example the multiplicity fluctuations in heavy - ion collisions have been investigated by several authors , including g.  wilk _ _ et al.__@xcite . connecting to such studies , we have obtained tsallis distribution for particular particle number fluctuation patterns due to a finite heat bath , for details see @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "further non - extensive distribution functions were being proposed and studied to describe the data on @xmath0 spectra in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "k.  urmossy _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a model in which the hadrons produced in heavy - ion collisions stem from a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , referred to as soft yields , on top of those stemming from jets , called hard yields @xcite . both of these contributions are distributed according to respective cut power - laws , @xmath10 .",
    "based on this view in this paper we investigate the scatter of the parameter @xmath5 with respect to the fitted temperatures @xmath1 .",
    "this investigation should differentiate between hard and soft origin of power laws and should look different for heavy - ion as for @xmath11 data .",
    "considering quantum - statistics even further constraints arise from particle - hole cpt symmetry .",
    "they lead to a special requirement on the cut power - law function , alternatively called deformed exponential @xcite : @xmath12 for the pareto - hagedorn - tsallis distribution , @xmath13 , it is easy to see that it does not satisfy this relation , therefore it is inadequate to apply naively extended quantum statistical distributions in the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath1 are the energy , chemical potential and temperature of the system , respectively , following the notation used in @xcite . in the present paper we also shall apply the @xmath4-exponential distribution , proposed by g.  kaniadakis for the description of relativistic plasmas @xcite .",
    "we compare our corresponding analysis with the ones using tsallis distribution , discussed above .",

    "particle transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) spectra provide a tool for measuring thermal properties of the qgp formed in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions . nowadays",
    "more and more experimental data show that the @xmath0 spectrum exhibits power - like rather than the earlier expected exponential behavior , and multiparticle distributions are also broader than expected @xcite .",
    "the number of particles in such processes is not that large ( @xmath20 , much less than avogadro s number ) .",
    "all of these warrant a suitable modification of the thermal model by accounting for possible intrinsic fluctuations in observables measured in high - energy collisions .",
    "the non - extensive form of statistical mechanics , proposed by tsallis @xcite , has found applications in many fields including high energy physics @xcite . in several situations",
    "the @xmath0 spectra can be best described by a tsallis distribution , characterized by a non - extensive parameter @xmath5 and a scale parameter @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have demonstrated that @xmath5 turns to be a function of fluctuations of temperature @xmath1 , together with fluctuations of other variables , from an analysis of different experimental data @xcite .",
    "moreover , considering the statistical power - law tailed distributions as canonical distributions in a thermal system connected to a heat reservoir with finite heat capacity@xcite , we have the combined expression @xmath21 as next to leading order approximation in the total size of the system . here",
    "@xmath22 denotes the heat capacity of the reservoir , and @xmath23 .",
    "it is connected with the temperature and the underlying equation of state , @xmath24 , of the system via the relations @xmath25 and @xmath26 . here",
    "the averaging is done over the ensemble of different collision events with fluctuating parameters . for temperature fluctuations with the gaussian variance , @xmath27 , following from traditional consideration , one arrives at @xmath28 : nothing but the classical boltzmann  gibbs case .",
    "based on this more generalized function of the tsallis parameter @xmath5 , we consider two different situations :    1 .   constant relative variance due to @xmath29-fluctuations . in multi - particle production processes in heavy - ion collisions , it has been shown that the local temperature , @xmath30 , fluctuates from point to point around some equilibrium value , @xmath31 .",
    "however , for different collisions the relative variance due to its fluctuations stays approximately constant , namely @xmath32 thus we conclude from eq.([q - heat ] ) that @xmath33     \\label{const - var}\\ ] ] where we approximate the finite heat capacity by the ideal gas ratio @xmath34 .",
    "2 .   constant average occupancy . for elementary @xmath11 collisions on the other hand ,",
    "the measurements of charged particle multiplicity distributions are well described by the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) for the full rapidity region.@xcite within the nbd scenario we have the probability @xmath35 therefore we obtain the generating function @xmath36 for the expectation value and variance in the number we get @xmath37 assuming now that the average occupancy of phase space by the newly produced hadrons , @xmath38 , is constant , we arrive at another relation between @xmath1 and @xmath5 : @xmath39 again we used relatrions valid for ideal gases , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in fig.[constcplot ] the comparison between our model predictions and g wilk s collection is shown . from it",
    "we conclude that ( i ) for the fitting parameters with a tsallis distribution in @xmath42 collisions , assuming constant relative variance of temperature for different collisions works well with experimental data .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath11 collisions the relative fluctuations are no longer the same but the average occupancy parameter in the nbd looks constant for the full rapidity region .",

    "recently a so - called soft+hard model was proposed in ref.@xcite . according to this model the @xmath0 spectra",
    "are divided into hadron yields stemming from a supposedly 3d - isotropic qgp ( soft ) and from quasi 1d - jets ( hard ) , respectively : @xmath48 for both yields the classical tsallis distribution , @xmath49 , has been applied with independently fitted @xmath1 and @xmath5 parameters @xcite .",
    "we apply in the present work a radial blast wave flow based doppler factor to the heavy - ion data , interpreting the spectral temperature as @xmath50 with @xmath51 doppler - shifted temperature .",
    "this is a simplification compared to the classical tsallis distribution , that interprets the single particle energy as a relativistic expression with a given mass , @xmath52 : @xmath53 with @xmath54 transverse mass and @xmath55",
    ". for @xmath56 these expressions agree .",
    "then we inspect the @xmath0 spectra of charged hadrons as a sum of hard and soft yields @xmath57 for @xmath58 and the @xmath59-s being normalization constants .    for light particles like the pion in the observed @xmath0 range the assumption @xmath60 can safely be made and therefore @xmath61 leads to @xmath62 investigating pion yields from various centrality classes we fit therefore a sum of soft and hard @xmath7deformed distributions using the variable @xmath63 : @xmath64 moreover , for @xmath0 spectra stemming from the same identified hadrons but just for different centralities , the average @xmath3 can also be considered as a constant ; it is connected with nothing but the collision energy . in this model approximation",
