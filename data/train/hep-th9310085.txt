    "despite of the considerable amount of work devoted to the subject of chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories and in particular @xmath1 , the understanding of this non - perturbative phenomenon is still unsatisfactory @xcite .",
    "also the behaviour of quantum systems in a hot and dense enviroment ( eg . in neutron stars or in the early universe ) are still under active investigation @xcite . on another front",
    "there has been much effort on the apparently different problem of quantizing self - interacting theories in a background gravitational field @xcite .    rather than seeking new partial results for realistic @xmath2-dimensional theories",
    "we analyse a family of interacting theories of charged fermions , scalars , pseudo - scalars and photons propagating in 2-dimensional curved spacetime in detail .",
    "these models are defined by the action @xmath3,\\label{1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the electromagnetic field strength and @xmath5 the generally- and gauge covariant derivative .",
    "this family contains in particular the schwinger model ( @xmath6)@xcite and the gauged thirring model ( @xmath7)@xcite in curved spacetime @xmath8.\\ ] ] the coupling constant @xmath9 has been introduced in order to test the effect of non - minimal coupling to the gravitational field .",
    "finite temperature effects are then included by quantizing the system on an euclidean torus @xmath10\\times[0,l]$ ] with arbitrary metric .",
    "we choose coordinates such that @xmath11 @xmath12 is the inverse temperature and @xmath13 is the infrared cut - off which will be removed after the correlation have been calculated .",
    "furthermore , finite temperature boundary conditions are imposed on the quantum fields @xcite .    on the torus",
    "a general gauge potential with non - vanishing flux can be decomposed as @xmath14 where the last @xmath15 terms are recognized as hodge decomposition of the single valued part of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is an instanton potential giving rise to a quantized flux @xmath18 as a consequence the corresponding dirac operator has @xmath19 zero modes @xcite of chirality @xmath20 .",
    "these zero modes are responsible for a non vanishing chiral condensate @xmath21 as can be seen by inspecting the fermionic generating functional @xcite in the external fields@xmath22 and sources @xmath23 @xmath24=\\prod\\limits_{p=1}^{|k| } ( \\bar\\eta,\\psi_{0p})(\\psi_{0p}^{\\dagger},\\eta){\\det}^\\prime(i\\slash d)\\,e^{-\\int\\sqrt{g}\\bar\\eta(x)s_e(x , y)\\eta(y)}.\\label{pf}\\ ] ] here @xmath25 , are the @xmath19 zero modes in the topological sector @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes the zero mode truncated determinant .",
    "@xmath28 is the excited fermionic green s function .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the sectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 , since these contribute to the partition function and the chiral condensate , respectively .",
    "finally we introduce a chemical potential for the conserved electric charge . in the euclidean forumlation this is done by shifting the zero component of the gauge potential by an imaginary constant @xcite .",
    "as a first step in analyzing structure of the quantum theory we evaluate the partition function formally defined by @xmath31 e^{-s_b(a,\\phi,\\lambda , h)},\\label{part}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 after a covariant gauge fixing ( [ part ] ) is promoted to a well defined quantity . from ( [ pf ] )",
    "it is clear that only the trivial topological sector contributes to the partition function . then @xmath33 $ ] equals the determinant of the dirac operator @xmath34 which is related by conformal- and chiral transformations to @xmath35 hatted quantities refer to flat metric and constant gauge potentials .",

    "one must be careful in computing the hatted determinant since the gauge potential is complex .",
    "this has been done in @xcite with the result @xmath40(0,\\tau)\\bar\\theta\\big[{\\bar a_1\\atop -\\bar a_0}\\big](0,\\tau).\\label{hd}\\ ] ] the remaining functional integrals in ( [ part ] ) turn out to be of iterative gaussian type and yield after substitution of ( [ hd ] ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the dynamically generated `` photon '' mass .",
    "this result already indicates that in the trivial topological sector the theory ( [ 1 ] ) should be equivalent to a free , massive , neutral , boson even in curved space - time .",
    "note that the mass depends on @xmath44 .",
    "in particular ( [ part2 ] ) shows that only the transversal part of the current - current interaction contributes to the mass renormalization in the thirring model .",
    "note also that the chemical potential does not appear in the final result for the partition function .",
    "this may not come as a surprise , because of the equivalence to a uncharged boson .",
    "also @xmath45\\es 0 $ ] is the only result consistent with gauss s law .",
    "we consider this consistency as a confirmation of our definition of the fermionic determinant which differs from previous ones in the literature @xcite .",
    "the non - minimal coupling to gravity ( for @xmath46 ) contributes to the gravitational anomaly and therefore affects the intensity of the hawking radiation",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath47 is the order parameter for the chiral symmetry breaking , responsible for the mass term in ( [ part2 ] ) . here",
    "we evaluate the dependence of the order parameter on temperature and curvature . recalling ( [ pf ] ) we see that only configurations within the topological sectors @xmath48 can contribute to this expectation value .",

    "@xmath51 has been computed in the previous section ( [ part2 ] ) .",
    "the generalization of ( [ anomaly ] ) to non - zero @xmath26 reads @xmath52 where the hatted determinant now also contains the instanton potential .",
    "@xmath53 is the normmatrix of the zero modes @xmath54 and @xmath55 satisfies the differential equation @xmath56 all information about the harmonics and the chemical potential is contained in the zero modes .",
    "however , @xmath57 and hence @xmath58 where the expectation value is evaluated with @xmath59.\\ ] ] a formal calculation of the resulting gaussian integrals yields @xmath60 \\exp\\big[{2\\pi g_2 ^ 2\\over 2\\pi+g_2 ^ 2}\\,g_0(x , x)\\big],\\label{cc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the massive and massless green s functions respectively .",
    "as it stands ( [ cc ] ) is still a formal expression since @xmath63 is logarithmically divergent when @xmath64 tends to @xmath65 . to extract a finite answer we need to renormalize the operator @xmath66",
    "this wave function renormalization is equivalent to the renormalization of the fermion field in the thirring model and thus is very much expected already in flat space time @xcite .",
    "its generalization to curved space - time is found to be @xmath67.\\ ] ] to determine the chiral condensate we also need to determine @xmath68 on the diagonal . in a first step",
    "we shall obtain it for the flat torus .",
    "its curvature dependence is then determined in a second step .    for @xmath69",
    "the green s function @xmath70 has been computed in @xcite .",
    "substitution of this green s function leads , after removing the infrared cut - off , to the following exact formula for the _ chiral condensate on flat space _ @xmath71,\\label{chirt}\\ ] ] where @xmath72.\\ ] ] for arbitrary values of the temperature and @xmath44 the infinite sum @xmath73 is evaluated on a computer ( fig.1 ) .",
    "it is however interesting to discuss some limiting cases .    for low temperatures , compared to @xmath74 we have @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the euler constant .",
    "substitution of ( [ ft ] ) yields the _ zero temperature _",
    "result @xmath77 on the other hand for temperatures large compared to the induced photon mass @xmath73 vanishes .",
    "thus we obtain the _ high temperature behaviour _ @xmath78 hence the chiral condensate decays exponentially for high temperatures approaching zero assymptotically .",
    "the coupling to the pseudoscalars @xmath79 weakens the effect of the temperature while the scalar field @xmath80 has no effect . for the gauged thirring model",
    "this result implies that only the transversal part of the current - current coupling affects the chiral condensate .",
    "finally note that , as the partition function , the chiral condensate does not depend on the chemical potential .",
    "1 : the chiral condensate as a function of the temperature and the coupling constant @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83\\ ] ]    how does the gravitational field affect the chiral condensate ? to answer this question we need to know the massive green s function , entering in ( [ kxx ] ) , for non - trivial gravitational fields ( for simplicity we assume @xmath84 ) .",
    "let us first consider a space with constant positive curvature .",
    "then @xmath85 has been computed explicitely @xcite .",
    "here we only need the short distance expansion , given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the digamma function . substituting ( [ gmr ] ) into ( [ kxx ] ) we end up with the exact formula for the _ chiral condensate for constant curvature _ @xmath89.\\label{chirr}\\ ] ] the assymptotic expansions for _ large - and small curvatures _ are easily worked out inserting the corresponding expansions for the digamma function @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath90\\hspace{.5cm}\\hbox{for } \\;\\frac{{\\cal{r}}}{m_\\gamma}\\rightarrow 0\\label{smallr}\\ ] ] and @xmath91\\hspace{.5cm}\\hbox{for } \\;\\frac{{\\cal{r}}}{m_\\gamma}\\rightarrow\\infty.\\label{bigr}\\ ] ] hence the chiral condensate decays exponentially for large curvature analogous to the high temperature behaviour .",
    "however , the pseudo - scalars do not supress the effect of the curvature in contrast to ( [ bigt ] ) .",
    "comparing the exponentials in ( [ bigr ] ) to ( [ bigt ] ) we are lead to define the curvature induced effective temperature as @xmath92 in passing we note that if we compare the prefactors , rather than the exponentials , we would write @xmath93 the latteridentification actually coincides ( up to factor of @xmath94 ) with the hawking temperature of free scalars in de sitter space @xcite .",
    "the correct identification involves the ( dynamical ) mass of the gauge field and is therefore not universal . from this observation",
    "we learn that the temperature associated with curvature depends on the matter content .",
    "note finally that the non - minimal coupling ( @xmath9 ) has no effect on the chiral condensate . in fig .",
    "2 we have plotted the chiral condensate for arbitrary constant values of the curvature .",
    "2 : the chiral condensate as a function of the curvature and the coupling constant @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath95\\ ] ]    for gravitational backgrounds with non - constant curvature we have to refer to perturbative methods for the calculation of the massive green s function .",
    "again we only need the short distance expansion of @xmath85 . for geodesic distances @xmath96",
    "small compared to @xmath97 the massive green s function may be approximated by the seeley dewitt expansion @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the hankel function of the second kind and order zero .",
    "in particular @xmath100 \\mtx{for } z\\to 0.\\ ] ] inserting ( [ h0 ] ) into ( [ kxx ] ) we end up with the following expansion for the _ chiral condensate in an arbitrary background _",
    "@xmath101,\\label{chirs}\\ ] ] where we have used that @xmath102 .",
    "the first order contribution involves @xmath103 and reproduces the assymptotic behaviour ( [ smallr ] ) .",
    "higher order contributions must be taken into account to uncover the effect of variable curvature .",
    "for this one has to substitute is the corresponding seeley dewitt coefficients @xmath104 into ( [ chirs ] ) . these have been computed up to @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "we have computed the partition function and the order parameter of the chiral symmetry breaking for a thirring - like gauge theory .",
    "in particular we find that both , high temperature and high curvature supress the condensate exponentially .",
    "comparing the two results , we defined a curvature induced effective temperature which , unlike the hawking temperature , depends on the matter content and is therefore not universal .",
    "furthermore we have shown that a non - minimal coupling to gravity affects the hawking radiation while it has no effect on the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the non - minimal coupling choosen in our model is however not unique and this result is therefore not general . finally we obtain that a chemical potential for the electric charge does affect neither the partition function , nor the chiral condensate , in consitency with gauss s law .",
