    "one of the most interesting results obtained at rhic in au ",
    "au collisions was the observation that the baryon ( anti - baryon ) production at intermediate transverse momenta becomes comparable to that of mesons  @xcite .",
    "the topological decay reconstruction of k@xmath0and @xmath1  provides a unique opportunity to extend the baryon and meson identification to much larger transverse momenta than would be possible using conventional particle identification methods .",
    "measurement performed by the star collaboration ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , showed that the baryon / meson ratio reaches its maximum at @xmath6  gev/@xmath4 and starts decreasing at higher momenta .",
    "the maximum value of the @xmath1/k@xmath0ratio in central collisions was found to exceed unity .",
    "the question of why , in nucleus - nucleus collisions , baryons at intermediate @xmath7 appear to be more easily produced than mesons is still open .",
    "possible explanations involve interplays between soft and hard mechanisms of particle production ( also at the partonic level ) like those discussed , for example , in ref .",
    "the evolution of the baryon / meson ratio with collision energy may yield additional information about this `` baryon anomaly '' .",
    "in this article , we present the @xmath1/k@xmath0ratios measured by the alice experiment at the lhc in 1.1@xmath810@xmath9 minimum bias pb  pb events at @xmath10  tev as a function of transverse momentum and for different collision centrality bins , as well as in pp collisions at @xmath3 and 7  tev .",
    "the alice experiment is well suited for k@xmath0and @xmath1  reconstruction over a wide momentum range . for the results discussed here",
    ", the momentum range @xmath11  gev/@xmath4 is defined by our current level of understanding the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the k@xmath0and @xmath1  particles were reconstructed via their v0 decay topology  @xcite .",
    "the method was the same for both pp and pb  pb collisions .",
    "the typical reconstruction efficiencies ( extracted from monte carlo studies ) were about 40  % for k@xmath0and 30  % for @xmath1   at @xmath12  gev/@xmath4 ( close to the @xmath1/k@xmath0maximum ) . in the momentum range",
    "@xmath13  gev/@xmath4 , the variation of the ratio of the reconstruction efficiencies for k@xmath0and @xmath1  was no larger than 12  % .",
    "the @xmath7 spectra of k@xmath0 obtained in centrality bins in pb ",
    "pb collisions were compared with the spectra of charged kaons reconstructed by the alice time projection chamber and the time of flight detector . at @xmath14  gev/@xmath4 ,",
    "the two sets of spectra agreed within 12  %  @xcite .",
    "the spectra of @xmath1  were corrected for the contribution of @xmath1 s coming from decays of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this was done by re - scaling the corresponding distributions extracted from monte carlo simulations with the @xmath7 spectrum of @xmath15 reconstructed in real data , assuming that the number @xmath16 is proportional to the reconstructed number of @xmath15 .",
    "the obtained feed - down corrections turned out to be of the order of 20  % and changed within only a few per cent as a function of event centrality and transverse momentum .",
    "the efficiency and feed - down corrections were checked with the life - time distributions for the v0 particles .",
    "these distributions were corrected as functions of two variables , @xmath7 and decay length .",
    "this was done for all the event centrality bins separately .",
    "the statistical error of the reconstructed life times for k@xmath0and @xmath1  was of the order of 1  % .",
    "however , the systematic deviation from the corresponding nominal values was @xmath174  % in the case of the most central events .    altogether , we considered the following main sources of systematic uncertainties , listed here along with their contributions to the overall uncertainty : signal extraction ( 3  % ) , efficiency correction ( 7  % for @xmath18  gev/@xmath4 , 1  % for @xmath19  gev/@xmath4 ) , feed - down correction ( 5  % ) , admixture of @xmath1 s generated in the detector material ( 2  % ) .",
