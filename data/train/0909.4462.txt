    "particle physicists now have long familiarity with the low - lying spectrum of @xmath3 ( upsilon ) and @xmath4 ( psi ) mesons but they nevertheless continue to provide a very important testing ground for our understanding of strong interaction physics .",
    "the similar @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) system , on the other hand , is largely unexplored territory so predictions of the meson masses are very valuable .",
    "these predictions need to be as accurate as possible ( and with an error budget ) to provide stringent tests of qcd .",
    "lattice qcd is clearly one of the best ways to do this , now that accurate calculations including the full effect of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 sea quarks inside hadrons are possible  @xcite .",
    "it has already provided successful predictions of the pseudoscalar @xmath10 mass  @xcite ( with a 14 mev error ) and the @xmath6 mass  @xcite ( with a 20 mev error ) , both subsequently seen by experiment . here",
    "we give a prediction for the vector @xmath11 mass through the mass difference between the @xmath11 and the @xmath6 .",
    "mesons composed of valence heavy ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) quarks are relatively simple because they are nonrelativistic systems and a potential model may be expected to work reasonably well ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath14 system where @xmath15 ( in units of @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is less true for charmonium where @xmath17 and so relativistic corrections are much larger there .",
    "the ground state hyperfine ( vector - pseudoscalar ) mass splitting is such a correction , but is given in leading order perturbation theory by a simple formula since the @xmath18 potential is proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the masses of the quark and antiquark and @xmath23 is the wavefunction at the origin from the potential model . using this formula to calculate",
    "the splitting will have a systematic error at @xmath24@xmath25 i.e. 30% in @xmath4 , 10% in @xmath3 and 20% in @xmath5 .",
    "however , the @xmath4 hyperfine splitting has been used in the past to fix the effective value of @xmath26 in eq .",
    "[ eq : hyp ] and then that 30% error affects all subsequent calculations . a larger problem , perhaps , is the variation in results between different potential models tuned to the spin - independent spectrum .",
    "this is because that spectrum does not in practice constrain the wavefunction at the origin at all strongly .",
    "the mass splitting between @xmath11 and @xmath6 can vary in the range 40 - 90 mev  @xcite between different potentials , which makes it hard to decide a ` central value ' and error budget .",
    "the reduced mass in the @xmath6 system is roughly one half that of @xmath3 and 1.5 times that of the @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath27 in @xmath6 but @xmath28 , which makes a nonrelativistic treatment worse in principle than for charmonium .",
    "an alternative approach is to treat the @xmath6 as a ` heavy - light ' system using ideas from hqet but , for example , it is difficult to estimate the light quark mass dependence of the @xmath29 operator giving rise to the hyperfine splitting , limiting again the accuracy in the prediction .",
    "lattice qcd , on the other hand , can provide very stringent tests of qcd from the hadron spectrum , in which all sources of systematic error can now be tested and quantified  @xcite .",
    "the only parameters are those of qcd itself ( a quark mass for every flavor and a coupling constant ) and impressively accurate results in agreement with experiment can be produced for the whole range of gold - plated hadron masses known experimentally .",
    "our previous prediction of the @xmath6 mass  @xcite dates from the relatively early days of full lattice qcd calculations and is now being improved .",
    "we have since developed a much more accurate method for handling charm quarks within lattice qcd and that has enabled a determination of the @xmath6 mass with smaller systematic errors  @xcite .",
    "this method also allows an accurate prediction of the @xmath11 and we describe that calculation here .",
    "from above it is clear that an optimal lattice qcd approach to the @xmath6 is to combine a nonrelativistic method for the @xmath12 quark with a relativistic one for @xmath13 .",
    "here we use lattice nrqcd for the @xmath12 , developed over many years  @xcite to provide accurate bottomonium spectroscopy  @xcite by including spin - independent terms through @xmath24@xmath30 and leading spin - dependent terms with discretisation corrections through @xmath24@xmath31 . for the @xmath13 quark",
    "we use highly improved staggered quarks ( hisq )  @xcite , a fully relativistic discretisation of the dirac action which is accurate enough to handle @xmath13 quarks because it is fully improved through @xmath24@xmath31 and also has the leading @xmath32 errors removed .",
    "this enables us to use the same lattice qcd action for charm , strange and light quarks ( we take @xmath33 ) .",
    "this approach , as we shall see , enables us to cancel some systematic errors between the @xmath6 system and the @xmath34 system and obtain the hyperfine splitting in the @xmath6 as a multiple of the experimentally known splitting  @xcite in the @xmath34 system .",
    ".[tab : params]ensembles ( sets ) of milc configurations used with gauge coupling @xmath35 , size @xmath36 and sea masses ( @xmath37 tadpole parameter , @xmath38 ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the lattice spacing values in units of @xmath41 after ` smoothing ' are given in column 3  @xcite .",
    "column 8 gives the number of configurations and time sources per configuration that we used for calculating correlators .",
    "on set 5 only half the number were used for light quarks . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the terms from the hisq action that contribute to the hyperfine splitting are hidden inside the discretisation of the dirac covariant derivative . because hisq is a relativistic action , these terms will automatically be correct in the @xmath42 limit .",
    "the spin - dependent term in the nrqcd action that gives rise to the hyperfine splitting can instead be explicitly pinpointed as the @xmath43 term  @xcite .",
    "this term has the correct tree - level coefficient to match full qcd at @xmath24@xmath30 but radiative corrections beyond this have not been included .",
    "hence the normalisation of this term , and the normalisation of the hyperfine splitting , have an uncertainty of @xmath24@xmath44 ( @xmath45 20% ) .",
    "this uncertainty is part of the nrqcd action and hence the same uncertainty appears regardless of which light quark is combined with the @xmath12 quark and cancels in ratios of hyperfine splittings . in table  [ tab : results ] we also give values for @xmath46 and the corresponding quantity , @xmath47 , for @xmath48 quarks . on sets 1 - 4 @xmath47",
    "is given directly by a joint fit to @xmath34 and @xmath49 correlators .",
    "all @xmath47 values agree with 1 within 30% errors .",
    "figure [ fig : bc_split ] shows @xmath50 as a function of lattice spacing .",
    "there is little dependence on the light quark mass , since neither the @xmath6 nor the @xmath34 contain valence light quarks and we do not expect strong sensitivity to the sea content .",
    "lattice spacing dependence is mild  the dashed line shows an extrapolation to the continuum limit at @xmath51 that can be compared to experiment .",
    "the extrapolation includes @xmath52 and @xmath53 terms and allows for linear dependence on sea quark masses . in that limit",
    "we find @xmath54 .",
    "this , along with the results for @xmath47 show , somewhat surprisingly , that the hyperfine splitting varies hardly at all with the mass of the lighter quark in the @xmath0 system , up to and including charm .    the result is backed up by the existing experimental results on heavy - light and heavy - strange mesons . in the @xmath55 system",
    "the hyperfine splittings differ by only 2% between the @xmath56 and the @xmath57",
    ". some of this difference may in fact be a result of coupled - channel effects since the @xmath58 is just above threshold for the decay to @xmath59 , whereas the @xmath60 has only the ozi - disfavoured decay mode @xmath61 available .",
    "the experimental situation is less clear in the @xmath0 sector since some experimental results favour a @xmath62 splitting very close to the @xmath63 ( not yet differentiated into charged and neutral modes ) and others favour a somewhat larger splitting  @xcite .",
    "we use the pdg average value of 46.1(1.5 ) mev  @xcite for the @xmath62 splitting because , in keeping with our result and indications from the @xmath55 sector , this is closer to the @xmath63 splitting than the pdg fit value of 49.0(1.5 ) mev  @xcite .",
    "our result for @xmath64 gives 53(7 ) mev for the @xmath65 splitting , where the error is statistical only .",
    "additional systematic errors come from relativistic corrections to the @xmath43 term in the nrqcd action  @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the size of these from the size of @xmath66 in the @xmath6 ( 0.05 ) and the @xmath34 ( = ( @xmath67 = 0.01 ) .",
    "the cancellation between them leads to a 4% systematic error .",
    "any mistuning of the @xmath12 quark mass will cancel in @xmath64 , and small mistunings of the @xmath9 and @xmath13 quark masses lead to a negligible error .",
    "electromagnetic hyperfine effects missing from our calculation should also be negligible ( less than 1% ) .",
    "adding our value for the @xmath65 splitting to the experimental mass for the @xmath6 gives the mass of the @xmath11 as 6.330(7)(2)(6 ) gev where the first two errors are from the lattice qcd calculation - statistics and systematics respectively - and the third error is from experiment for the @xmath6 and the @xmath68 . the relatively small value of the @xmath65 splitting will make it challenging to find the @xmath11 from its decay to @xmath69 .    the absence of strong dependence of the hyperfine splitting on the mass of the lighter quark in the @xmath0 system is an interesting result , which has implications for other spin - dependent splittings in the @xmath6 system .",
    "in hqet language it says that matrix elements of the hyperfine operator are insensitive to the light quark mass , up to and including charm . in constituent quark model language , using a formula for the hyperfine splitting akin to that in eq .",
    "[ eq : hyp ] , the result implies that @xmath70 varies as @xmath71 to cancel the @xmath71 in the denominator  @xcite . the amplitude @xmath72 from the fit in eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] is proportional to @xmath23 in a nonrelativistic approach .",
    "this does show significant dependence on the light quark mass in the @xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : goldmesonplot ] we summarise the current status of the gold - plated meson spectrum as determined from lattice qcd , highlighting those meson masses which have been made as predictions ahead of experiment .",
    "the result here is the most accurate prediction to date .",
