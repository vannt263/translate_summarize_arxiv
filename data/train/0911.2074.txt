    "the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy especially at supra - saturation densities is among the most uncertain properties of neutron - rich nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "however , it is very important for nuclear structure@xcite , heavy - ion reactions@xcite and many phenomena / processes in astrophysics and cosmology @xcite . heavy - ion reactions especially those induced by radioactive beams",
    "provide a unique opportunity to constrain the symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "various probes using heavy - ion reactions have been proposed in the literature , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite for the most recent review .",
    "it is particularly interesting to mention that , besides many significant results about the symmetry energy at sub - saturation densities , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite , circumstantial evidence for a rather soft symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities has been reported very recently@xcite based on the ibuu04 transport model@xcite analysis of the @xmath3 data taken by the fopi collaboration at sis / gsi@xcite . to constrain tightly and reliably the nuclear symmetry energy especially at supra - saturation densities , much more efforts by both the nuclear physics and the astrophysics communities",
    "are still needed .",
    "there is an urgent need to verify the conclusion about the soft symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities required to reproduce the fopi @xmath3 data within transport model analyses@xcite .",
    "it was predicted that the neutron - proton differential flow is another sensitive probe of the high - density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy@xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to measure observables involving neutrons .",
    "one question often asked by some experimentalists is whether the triton-@xmath0he pair may carry the same information as the neutron - proton one .",
    "we will try to answer this question quantitatively by coupling the ibuu04 calculations to a phase - space coalescence after - burner .",
    "indeed , we found that , similar to the neutron - proton pair , the triton-@xmath4he relative and differential transverse flows are sensitive to the high - density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "they can be used to test indications about the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy observed earlier from analyzing the @xmath3 data .",
    "our study is carried out based on the ibuu04 version of an isospin and momentum dependent transport model and the simplest phase - space coalescence after - burner .",
    "the single nucleon potential is one of the most important inputs to buu - like transport models for nuclear reactions . in the ibuu04 transport model",
    ", we use a single nucleon potential derived within the hartree - fock approach using a modified gogny effective interaction ( mdi ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding mdi symmetry energy can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite    because most buu - type transport models including the ibuu04 are incapable of forming dynamically realistic nuclear fragments , some types of after - burners , such as statistical and coalescence models , are normally used as a remedy .",
    "this kind of hybrid models can be used to study reasonably well , for instance , nuclear multifragmentation , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite , collective flow of light fragments , see e.g. , @xcite and the formation of hypernuclei@xcite .",
    "there are , however , some remaining issues , such as the freeze - out time of fragments that is related to the time of coupling the transport model with the after - burner , etc . there are also interesting work in using advanced coalescence models@xcite , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite . we notice here that , several advanced cluster recognition routines , such as , the early cluster recognition algorithm ( ecra ) @xcite , the simulated annealing clusterization algorithm ( saca ) @xcite , have been put forward in recent years . for the purposes of the present exploration ,",
    "however , we use the simplest phase - space coalescence model , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite , where a physical fragment is formed as a cluster of nucleons with relative momenta smaller than @xmath5 and relative distances smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "the results presented in the following are obtained with @xmath7 mev / c and @xmath8 fm .",
    "this simple choice may thus limit the scope and importance of our study here .",
    "for instance , we shall limit ourselves to studies of the relative / differential observables for t-@xmath0he pairs without attempting to study pairs of the heavier mirror nuclei .",
    "an extended study including the heavy mirror nuclei using the advanced coalescence and/or earlier cluster recognition methods is planned .",
    "we now investigate whether the transverse collective flows of triton and @xmath4he can be used to probe the symmetry energy .",
    "firstly , we examine in fig .",
    "[ resflow ] their transverse flows individually .",
    "the average c.m",
    ". transverse momentum per nucleon @xmath9 in the reaction plane is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total number of fragments of mass a in the rapidity bin at @xmath12 .",
    "the correlation between the @xmath9 and rapidity @xmath12 reveals the transverse collective flow@xcite .",
    "it is seen that @xmath4he clusters show a stronger flow than triton clusters .",
    "this is mainly due to the stronger coulomb force experienced by the @xmath4he clusters .",
    "more interestingly , the transverse flow of @xmath4he clusters show appreciable sensitivity to the variation of the symmetry energy .    the transverse flow is a result of actions of several factors including the isoscalar , symmetry and coulomb potentials and nucleon - nucleon scatterings .",
    "it is well known that the transverse flow is sensitive to the isoscalar potential .",
    "given the remaining uncertainties associated with the isoscalar potential and the small size of the symmetry energy effects , it would be very difficult to extract any reliable information about the symmetry energy from the individual flows of triton and @xmath4he clusters .",
    "thus techniques of reducing effects of the isoscalar potential while enhancing effects of the isovector potential are very helpful @xcite .",
    "we thus study in fig .",
    "[ clusterflow ] the triton-@xmath4he relative and differential flows .",
    "the relative flow is given as @xmath13 the triton-@xmath4he differential flow reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the number of triton and @xmath4he in the rapidity bin at @xmath12 . from the upper panel of fig.[clusterflow ] , it is seen that the triton-@xmath4he relative flow is very sensitive to the symmetry energy .",
    "because of the larger slope of the @xmath4he flow , the triton-@xmath4he relative flow shows a negative slope at mid - rapidity .",
    "effects of the symmetry energy on the differential flow shown in the lower panel , however , is relatively small .",
    "although the @xmath4he flow is more sensitive to the symmetry energy , the small number of @xmath4he clusters makes the @xmath4he flow contributes less to the triton-@xmath4he differential flow ( as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ diflow ] ) ) . the triton-@xmath4he differential flow is therefore dominated by triton clusters .",
    "consequently , it is less sensitive to the symmetry energy than the triton-@xmath4he relative flow . the slope @xmath17 of the transverse flow at mid - rapidity can be used to characterize more quantitative the symmetry energy effects .",
    "we found that for the t-@xmath0he relative flow , @xmath18 mev / c and @xmath19 mev / c , respectively .",
    "for the t-@xmath0he differential flow , @xmath20 mev / c and @xmath21 mev / c , respectively .",
    "the t-@xmath0he relative flow thus can be used as a very useful and independent tool to test the soft symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities extracted from studying the @xmath3 ratio@xcite .",
    "in summary , using a hybrid approach coupling the transport model ibuu04 to a phase - space coalescence after - burner we studied the t-@xmath0he relative and differential flows in semi - central @xmath1 reactions at an incident energy of @xmath2 mev / nucleon .",
    "we found that the nuclear symmetry energy affects strongly the t-@xmath0he relative and differential flows .",
    "the t-@xmath0he relative flow can be used as a particular powerful probe of the high - density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
