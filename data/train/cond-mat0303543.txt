    "granular flow exhibits a variety of dynamical phenomena , which have been attracting research interests for years ( for reviews , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "its complex behaviors can be seen even in a simple situation like the gravitational flow on a slope .",
    "when the inclination angle is large and the slope is rough , a rapid and relatively low - density flow is realized , and the interaction between grains is dominated by inelastic collisions . on the other hand , when the inclination angle is small , the flow becomes dense and slow , and the frictional interaction plays an important role ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the steady granular flow , however , turns out to be unstable in various ways , and shows rich phenomena .    in the experiment on a shallow granular flow on a wide slope , @xcite",

    "this phenomenon has been analyzed by means of the hydrodynamic equations for rapid granular flow ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "they have calculated the steady solutions and examined its linear stability numerically .",
    "they have found that , at a certain parameter region , the steady flow shows the `` inverted density profiles '' , in which the maximum density appears not at the bottom but at a finite distance from the bottom because of the agitation by the collisions with the rough solid bottom .",
    "it has been shown that the solutions with the `` inverted density profiles '' are unstable against the perturbations transverse to the flowing direction , and the instability results in the vortex patterns analogous to the rolls in the rayleigh - brnard convection ; the streaks found in the experiment were interpreted as the result of the rolls of vortices .",

    "the present authors have performed the molecular dynamics simulations of two - dimensional granular flow on a slope and found that the steady flows are unstable against the density wave formation when the length of the slope is long enough and/or the particle density is low enough ( ( * ? ? ? * mitarai & nakanishi 2001 ) ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform the linear stability analysis on the hydrodynamic equations to investigate the nature of the density wave formation instability found in the experiments and the numerical simulations .",
