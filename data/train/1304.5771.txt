    "attempts of cellular automata classification were made by several authors .",
    "proposed approaches are based , either on observations of the automata behaviour , or properties of the rules themselves .",
    "the most famous classification of the elementary cellular automata ca belongs to the first category , and was introduced by wolfram @xcite .",
    "the classification regarded the character of automata evolution and led to the division of the whole set of elementary rules into four classes .",
    "the first group includes rules which applied to a given sequence , cause removal of any randomness , and as a consequence lead to a stable state .",
    "the rules included into the second class lead to a stable or oscillating character of evolution .",
    "the third class covers rules which show with pseudo - random or chaotic behaviour .",
    "the fourth class is especially interesting as it covers rules which lead to complex evolution .",
    "the classification makes it possible to see differences in behaviour of the system observed during the evolution ruled by the particular automata .",
    "+ besides the wolfram s classification there are also different propositions .",
    "one of them was introduced by li at al . @xcite .",
    "the classification is based on the observation of the asymptotic behaviour of the elementary ca , and , as a result , six types are distinguished .",
    "ca for which evolution leads to : a ) spatially homogeneous fixed point , b ) spatially inhomogeneous fixed point or a uniform shift of a fixed pattern , c ) periodic behaviour or shifted periodic behaviour , d ) locally chaotic behaviour , e ) chaotic behaviour or f ) complex behaviour .",
    "another classification is based on the concept of equicontinuity which originally was introduced by gilman @xcite and then extended by kurka @xcite , where an equicontinuity set contains a set of its lyapunov stable points . in this scheme , similarly to wolfram s classification , each ca can be included into one of the four categories : equicontinuous ca , ca with some equicontinuous points , sensitive but not positively expansive and positively expansive .",
    "it is not clear _ a priori _ to which category a particular automaton belongs , but for the elementary ca this problem can be solved @xcite .",
    "a review of the classification methods , along with a discussion of problems that arise when attempting classification of automata , is presented by sutner in @xcite .",
    "analysis of cellular automata properties is an important problem as they have a lot of applications in modelling of physical processes , such as diffusion , phase transition , wave propagations or road traffic analysis @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a method of class identification which is based on the similarities observed in patterns of connections between possible states of the analysed system . here",
    "we say that two states are connected if one state is obtained from another one , according to a given automaton rule .",
    "the presented method takes into account the symmetry observed in the state space , and it allows us to indicate equivalent - according to symmetry - rules .",
    "the method is exhaustive , and is based on scrupulous analysis performed for sequences of lengths up to @xmath17 ( in some cases longer if the character of results does not allow conclusions to be drawn earlier ) .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "the analysed system is presented . in the section after that our procedure for identification of classes is described .",
    "section [ results ] is devoted to discussion about the obtained results , and the last section provides their summary .",
    "we analyse a one - dimensional cellular automaton , with two possible states of each cell , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the rule of the change of a state of a cell is determined on the basis of the state of the cell itself and its two nearest neighbours .",
    "namely , the rule is a chain @xmath20 of outcomes of the states of these three cells , in a decreasing order @xmath21 .",
    "such a definition leads to @xmath22 different rules of the evolution process , so called elementary cellular automata .",
    "it was however shown that the number of unique rules is lower , as some of the rules are equivalent @xcite .",
    "the rules which are equivalent to a given one are obtained as its conjugation , reflection and combined operation of conjugation and reflection ( see tab.[equiv ] ) . as a result",
    ", the set of all @xmath23 elementary automata is reduced into @xmath2 unique rules , or in other words , to @xmath2 groups of equivalent rules .",
    "the same result was recently obtained in @xcite by an analysis of the symmetry of the rules .",
    "it may happen however , that after any change , the obtained rule is the same as at the beginning . because of that , symmetry groups do not always contain four rules . to be precise , there are @xmath24 groups which contain @xmath25 rules each , @xmath26 groups which contain @xmath27 rules each , and a remaining @xmath28 rules which form one - element groups .",

    "+    consider a system consisting of all possible sequences of zeros and ones of a specified length @xmath1 .",
    "each sequence can be converted to an exact single sequence determined by the automaton rule which is currently being considered .",
    "each sequence may , however , be obtained by the transformation of different numbers of sequences .",
    "the exact number of states ( sequences ) leading to a given state depends on the automaton rule and the system size @xmath1 .",
    "the state space considered can be represented as a directed graph , where @xmath45 nodes are identified with the possible states of the system . as for a given automaton",

    ". however , the in - degree is different for different nodes .",
    "let us consider a given automaton rule .",
    "analysis of the pattern of ties in the obtained graph allows us to indicate nodes which are similar , which means that the structure of connections of some nodes is the same .",
    "because of that , nodes can be divided into classes , and each class contains nodes which are similar . as a result , the state space formed by all possible classes is smaller than the initial network of states .",
    "the rate of the reduction depends on the system size .",
    "+ the concept of the reduction of the system size is based on the observation that , often in real systems , some kind of symmetry can be uncovered .",
    "if it is the case , it is possible to specify groups of states of the analysed system which manifest similar properties .",
    "when one thinks about the system like a graph , the mentioned similarities concern primarily nodes degrees .",
    "however , this quantity by itself does not reflect the node properties .",
    "if two nodes have the same degree , but the degrees of their neighbours are different , the nodes can not be classified as being similar . if weights of particular links in a graph are not equal , which is not the case here , one must also distinguish identical patterns of connections but with different weights .",
    "+ the class is defined as the set of nodes which have the same number of neighbours which belong to the same classes .",
    "the method of classes ( groups of similar nodes ) identification was described in detail in our previous papers @xcite . however , in the case of cellular automata the procedure is slightly different from that previously used .",
    "the underlying reason for the difference is that now the graph of transitions between states is directed .",
    "therefore , the class of states is determined both by the list of states which for a particular automaton lead to a given state , and the one - element list , which preserve information about the state which is obtained from the one actually being considered .",
    "the parameter which differentiate two nodes is their degree , so , at the very beginning of our procedure , all nodes which have the same degree are labelled with the same symbol . with this done",
    ", the next step is to check if the lists of symbols of neighbours of all nodes which have assigned a given symbol are exactly the same .",
    "if not , appropriate elements have to be distinguished : for each class where this ambiguity is observed , as many separate classes must be introduced as it is necessary to ensure that for any two states , which belong to a given class , the full agreement for both lists - states which lead to a given state and the state which are obtained from it - is obtained . in general , the obtained network of classes is weighted , as more than one of the neighbours of a given node in the network of states may belong to the same class . in a further analysis of the obtained network of classes one must take into account the number of states which belong to particular classes .",
    "the procedure usually leads to a significant reduction of the size of the system .",
    "+ it must be emphasised , that for each system size @xmath1 , the class structure obtained for the rules known to be equivalent @xcite should be exactly the same .",
    "an interesting question is if it is also true for the rules which belong to different symmetry groups , but equivalent according to the function @xmath0 .",
    "the number of classes for particular automata changes with the system size  @xmath1 .",
    "we can indicate a few different types of this dependence :    * _ automata no @xmath18 and @xmath46 _ + the number of classes is constant regardless of the system size and equals @xmath27 ; one class contains states composed of zeros or ones , respectively , and the second class contains all remaining possible sequences .",
    "all of them are transformed in one case to the state composed of zeros , and in the other to the state composed of ones . in other words ,",
    "in this case we obtain the star graph * _ automata no @xmath47 and @xmath48 _ + the second characteristic group of rules contains those for which just one class is obtained , irrespective of the system size ; the rules cause that both _ in _ and _ out _ degree of each state is equal to @xmath19 ; for the rules which belong to this group a new state of each cell is obtained as follows : for rule no @xmath14 a new state is equal to the previous one , for rule no @xmath13 it is negation of the previous state ; for the four remaining rules a new state is determined on the basis of the previous state of the one of the nearest neighbours , and it is the state currently assigned to the appropriate neighbour or its negation , namely it is : for rule no @xmath49 the state of the right neighbour , for rule no @xmath50 the negation of the right neighbour , for rule no @xmath48 the state of the left neighbour , and for rule no @xmath51 the negation of the left neighbour * _ automata no @xmath7 and @xmath8 _ + the number of classes in the case of these two rules form a sequence presented in tab.[seq105 ] ; during evolution in accordance with rule no @xmath7 , if the number of ones in the triple of cells ( a given cell and its two nearest neighbours ) is even - @xmath18 or @xmath27 - irrespective of the previous state of a given cell , it is set to @xmath19 , if it is odd the value is set to @xmath18 . in the case of rule no @xmath8",

    "the number of classes grows at the most as approximately @xmath64 , while the number of states as @xmath45 , where @xmath1 is the system size .",
    "the largest number of classes is observed for the automaton no @xmath65 , which belongs to the third class in the wolfram classification system , and displays chaotic behaviour @xcite .",

    "+    all but two rules for which atypical ( different that exponential ) character of the change of the number of classes with the sequence size are classified in @xcite as surjective rules .",
    "the rules which do not fulfil this property are automata no @xmath18 and @xmath46 .",

    "@xcite is equal to @xmath19 , which is expected as they are chaotic .",
    "however , our classification indicate that for two symmetry groups in the wolfram sense which are also classified as being chaotic , namely the groups @xmath74 $ ] and @xmath75 $ ] , a typical - exponential - increase of the number of classes with the sequence size is observed .",
    "our results show that the same number of classes can be found for automata which belong to different groups , out of @xmath2 possibilities ; in most cases this happens for a small number of groups for small @xmath1 . whether the structure of classes is the same or the observed compliance concerns only the number of classes , depends on the system size .",
    "however , in some cases the equivalence seems to be independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the detailed description is presented in tab.[longt ] .",
    "the first column contains @xmath2 groups of rules , one after another .",
    "the following columns present the numbers of classes identified , as dependent on the system size @xmath1 .",
    "the number of classes is supplemented with a letter , which makes it possible to distinguish cases for which the number of classes is the same but the lists of neighbouring states ( in- and out - states ) are different .",
    "the same class structure for different groups is observed or not , depending on @xmath1 .",
    "+ for automata for which the same symbol was assigned , the complete consistency of the networks of states and the ( reduced ) networks of classes is observed . as a criterion of the equivalence of networks of states",
    "we take the identity of lists of in- and out - neighbours of all states . in tab.[longt ] it is seen , for example , that the symbol @xmath76 for @xmath77 appears @xmath28 times , while for @xmath78 only @xmath25 times .",
    "the result means that in a previous case for @xmath28 symmetry groups , namely @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , networks of states and classes for @xmath77 is exactly the same .",

    "the case of automata no @xmath13 , @xmath14 and groups @xmath87 and @xmath15 should be considered separately . in this case , both networks - states and classes - are the same ( @xmath76 ) regardless of the system size @xmath1 .",
    "this is because these automata are reversible : the identity and negation , the left- shift and the right - shift and their negation .",
    "there , states take part in long ( e.g. left - shift ) or short ( identity ) loops . in principle",
    ", there is no difference between states .",
    "then , each state belongs to the same class , and there is only one class .",
    "hence , each state is produced by a state from the same class and also gives a state from the same class .",

    "+ on the other hand , it is worth noting that in the case of a few groups , the pattern of the change of the number of classes with the system size is exactly the same .",

    "namely , besides the obvious case of automata no @xmath18 and @xmath46 , a non - trivial dependence of the number of classes in a function of the system size is observed for automata no @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( and their equivalent rules ) . in most cases ,",
    "the class identification allows a significant reduction of the system size .",
    "the proposed method indicates that the number of symmetry groups is equal to @xmath89 , as for some groups indicated by wolfram , the same pattern of the change of the number of classes for different system size is observed .",
    "the proposed method also makes it possible to show that number of symmetry groups changes with the system size .",
    "+ the class reduction speeds up the calculation of the stationary probability distribution of particular configurations @xcite .",
    "in particular , all  garden of eden  configurations have the probability zero , and all configurations which form a cycle have the same probabilities . in our method , it appears that all states which belong to a given class have the same probability .",
    "hence , once we are able to calculate the probability of a given class we also know the probability of each state which belongs to this class . as a consequence ,",
    "any analysis which concerns stationary properties of the analysed system may be performed on a reduced , smaller representation of the system .",
    "the method was described in @xcite .",
    "although the results presented here are obtained for the elementary cellular automata , our method can be applied to any family of automata , irrespective of its rules and size of its neighbourhood .",
    "it should be also emphasised that the method is general , and it can be applied to any system for which we are able to define a state space and an elementary process which transforms one state into another . as our method is numerical and not analytical , one should be cautious in predicting an asymptotic behaviour of the system .",
    "what we are able to conclude , is the behaviour of the system in the range of finite n.    * acknowledgement : * the author is grateful to krzysztof  kuakowski for his critical reading of the manuscript and helpful discussion .",
