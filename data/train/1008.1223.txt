    "@xmath3 meson production from @xmath5 annihilation has been drawing intensive interest for its violation of the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule  @xcite .",
    "the usual statement of the ozi rule is that diagrams with disconnected quark lines can be negligible compared to those with connected quark lines . @xmath3",
    "meson is believed to be an almost pure @xmath6 state , while nucleon is universally considered to be composed of up and down quarks . thus according to the ozi rule , the reaction that @xmath5 annihilate to produce @xmath3 is to be suppressed .",
    "however , it is known that @xmath3 production evades the ozi rule in various hadronic reactions  @xcite .",
    "the study of the reaction is seen as a promising probe into the strangeness information of nucleon or nucleon resonances .    to interpret the substantial ozi rule violations , lindenbaum  @xcite and etkin et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out the intervention of glueball resonances , dover  @xcite argued @xmath7 four quark states produce selective enhancements , kochelev  @xcite took instanton effects into account , ellis et al .",
    "@xcite inferred considerable admixture of @xmath6 components in the nucleon . also , as ozi - forbidden reactions can proceed via two - step hadronic loops in which each individual transition is ozi - allowed  @xcite , lu et al .",
    "@xcite studied two - meson ( @xmath8 ) intermediate states and mull et al .",
    "@xcite investigated antihyperon - hyperon ( @xmath9 ) intermediate states , both of them educed compatible theoretical results with the experimental data .    on the other hand , recently , it has been suggested that the strong couplings of @xmath0 to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 may indicate a possible significant @xmath13 component in the quark wave function of @xmath0 and also a large coupling to @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "xie et al .",
    "@xcite deduced the significant coupling of @xmath0 to @xmath15 as @xmath16 . with such effective @xmath17 coupling , the measured @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 cross sections",
    "are well reproduced  @xcite .    in this article , we extend the model used in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the @xmath21 reaction .",
    "the scenario is that @xmath22 interact with each other by exchanging @xmath0 in @xmath23 channel , which has not been attempted by others so far .",
    "and @xmath24 with @xmath23-channel @xmath0 exchange , title=\"fig:\"]-0 cm     and @xmath24 with @xmath23-channel @xmath0 exchange , title=\"fig:\"]-0 cm    the feynman diagram for the @xmath21 reaction is depicted in fig.1  ( left ) .",
    "we use the effective lagrangian for @xmath25 as  @xcite @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the spin wave functions for the nucleon and @xmath0 resonance , respectively , and @xmath29 is the @xmath3-meson field . for the @xmath0-@xmath27-@xmath3 vertices ,",
    "the following monopole form factor is used : @xmath30 empirically the cut - off parameter @xmath31 for @xmath0 should be at least a few hundred mev larger than the @xmath28 mass , hence to be in the range of 2 to 4 gev .    then the amplitude and cross section can be obtained straightforwardly by applying the feynman rules to fig.1  ( left ) .",
    "@xmath32 with @xmath33 , and @xmath34",
    "exchange to the @xmath21 reaction with various @xmath31 parameter , compared with data  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    fig.2 shows the theoretical results for the contribution from the t - channel @xmath0 exchange to the @xmath21 reaction with various @xmath31 parameter , compared with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "one can see that for the invariant mass @xmath35 above 2.3 gev the new mechanism alone reproduces the data well with @xmath36 gev .    to check whether the new mechanism and its @xmath31 parameter are reasonable",
    ", we also use the same approach to study @xmath37 as shown in fig.1  ( right ) .",
    "the interaction lagrangian for @xmath38 coupling is  @xcite : @xmath39 with @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results for the contribution from the t - channel @xmath0 exchange with @xmath31=3 and 3.5 @xmath41 are shown in fig.3 .",
    "compared with experimental data  @xcite , the contribution is very small .",
    "this is consistent with the partial wave analysis of ref.@xcite which suggests a large s - channel resonant contribution from @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 meson resonances with masses of @xmath45 gev .",
    "these meson resonances have strong couplings to both @xmath46 and @xmath24 , allowed by the ozi rule .",
    "hence the t - channel @xmath0 exchange only plays a minor role for the @xmath47 reaction .",
    "these meson resonances can also decay to @xmath48 through strange meson or baryon loops  @xcite , which give a few times smaller rate .",
    "then the t - channel @xmath0 exchange plays a more important role for the @xmath49 reaction .",
    "however , while the contribution from the t - channel @xmath0 exchange can reproduce the @xmath49 cross sections above 2.3 gev , it can not reproduce the peak structure around 2.2 gev .",
    "this suggests that the s - channel resonances may still dominates here through the strange meson or baryon loops .      in summary",
    ", we have phenomenologically studied the contribution of the t - channel @xmath0 resonance exchange to the @xmath51 and @xmath24 reactions .",
    "while it plays only a minor role for the @xmath47 reaction , it gives a significant contribution to the @xmath49 reaction , especially for the energies above 2.3 gev .",
    "below 2.3 gev , the s - channel resonances may still dominates through the strange meson or baryon loops . before one tries to extract any definite information about the strangeness of the proton from this reaction as suggested by ref.@xcite",
    ", one should take these additional mechanisms into account .",
