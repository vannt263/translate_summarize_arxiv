    "the hubbard model  @xcite and its descendants have contributed greatly to our understanding of strongly correlated systems  @xcite and in particular of the metal - insulator transition  @xcite ( mit ) exhibited by them .",
    "early attempts  @xcite to explain the mit were based on the use of a projected wavefunction due to gutzwiller ( gwf ) .",
    "the gwf is a variational method whose starting point is a non - interacting wavefunction , in which double occupations and consequently charge fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "exact solutions to the gwf are known in one  @xcite and infinite dimensions  @xcite . in one dimension",
    "the exact solution of gwf is metallic , a conclusion which was shown  @xcite to be general for finite dimensions .",
    "the exact solution to the hubbard model at half - filling in one - dimension  @xcite is insulating for all finite values of the interaction strength .",
    "extended versions of the gwf with charge fluctuations can only account for insulating behavior when correlations between doubly occupied sites and empty sites are incorporated ( bound excitons )  @xcite .",
    "the gwf is often treated via an approximation also due to gutzwiller  @xcite ( ga ) .",
    "the ga predicts a mit  @xcite between a paramagnetic metal and a paramagnetic insulator ( brinkman - rice transition ) at half - filling , in contradiction with the exact gutzwiller solution .",
    "the ga also does not account for anti - ferromagnetic correlations properly whereas exact diagonalizations have shown that the gwf , inspite of being based only on projecting out double occupations , reproduces anti - ferromagnetic correlations remarkably well  @xcite . on the other hand the ga corresponds to the exact solution of the gwf when the number of dimensions is infinite  @xcite .",
    "an improved ga has previously been constructed by metzner  @xcite where it is shown that self - energy corrections can restore metallicity .",
    "another important study relevant here is that of van dongen _",
    "et al._@xcite in which it is shown that metallicity can be recovered based on dimensional scaling arguments , however finite orders of perturbation theory are not sufficient to remove the brinkman - rice mit . in two dimensions metallicity",
    "can be recovered  @xcite via a diagrammatic summation method in which the error terms are estimated with high accuracy  @xcite .",
    "this has also been demonstrated numerically  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the exchange hole ( pair - correlation function of particles with parallel spins , defined as @xmath0 where the average is over the fermi sea ) for non - interacting electrons at half filling , applied in ga is independent of the physical dimension .",
    "it corresponds to the exact gwf result only in infinite dimensions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rdf ] ) .",
    "the crucial point here is that in finite dimensions the exchange hole extends over several lattice sites , while in ga it is restricted to the on - site term .",
    "the central motivation of the present paper is to show that the failure of ga is due to the over - simplified approximation of the exchange hole .",
    "the ga consists of taking exchange into account in a combinatorial fashion .",
    "the configurations considered obey the pauli principle in the sense that no two particles of the same spin can be found on the same site . on the other hand no other correlation effect exists between like spins in the ga .",
    "hence the exchange hole is only local corresponding to the infinite dimensional case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rdf ] ) .",
    "it is known , however ( see for example refs . @xcite and @xcite ) that the exchange hole in a finite number of dimensions has a nontrivial functional form ( fig . [",
    "fig : rdf ] ) .",
    "the ga as well as extensions of it enjoy widespread use in a variety of strongly correlated problems .",
    "the brinkman - rice transition has been used by vollhardt to describe the solid - liquid phase transition in he@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "more recent applications of the ga include extension to the time - dependent case  @xcite , implementation for the multi - band case  @xcite , ensembles with varying particle number ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer wavefunction )  @xcite , and the calculation of matrix elements between ground and excited states  @xcite .",
    "variants of the approximate solution have also been applied  @xcite in the resonating valence bond method  @xcite , which is based on a completely projected gutzwiller wavefunction .    in this paper",
    "we augment the ga with an improved treatment of the exchange hole .",
    "our calculation samples the exact distribution in the occupation number representation .",
    "the hopping term , being the expectation value of an operator which is not diagonal in occupation number representation is approximated in a similar fashion as in the original ga .",
    "implementation consists of monte carlo sampling first used to calculate the exact gwf by yokoyama and shiba .  @xcite it may also be possible to approximate the distribution with the exchange hole as was done for continuous systems of interacting fermions .",
    "@xcite for lattices a two - site approximation which takes into account the exchange hole has been proposed by razafimandimby  @xcite .    to motivate the central idea of our approach",
    "the dimensional dependence of the exchange hole at half - filling is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdf ] . due to exchange",
    "there is an effective repulsion between nearest - neighboring ( @xmath2 ) particles which is strongest in the case of one dimension , and it decreases with the number of dimensions ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . further away from the origin",
    "( @xmath3 ) the functions exhibit gradually decreasing oscillations .",
    "via comparison with the full gwf we show that such a procedure brings the ga into excellent agreement with the full gwf .",
    "the interaction energy is exact as a function of the variational parameter , and the hopping energy also shows close correspondence where full gwf results are available .",
    "the anti - ferromagnetic order parameter is also in excellent agreement between our approach and the full gwf calculation , while the original ga significantly underestimates antiferromagnetism .",

    "the variational wavefunction to the hubbard model with which we are concerned is the gutzwiller wavefunction ( gwf ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 indicates a fermi sea of non - interacting fermions , the sum in the exponential counts the number of doubly occupied sites , and @xmath17 is a variational parameter . for a homogeneous system",
