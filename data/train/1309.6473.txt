    "consider the problem of estimating the integral of a function @xmath3 with respect to a probability distribution with density @xmath4 . a successful markov chain monte carlo or sequential monte carlo method allows us to estimate integrals with respect to @xmath4 in such a way that the error can be reduced down to zero by producing more samples .",
    "we call these methods `` exact '' since there is no systematic error in the estimation , even though the sampling error can be large for a given computational budget . using the metropolis  hastings algorithm ,",
    "exact inference is possible when the target probability density function @xmath4 can be evaluated pointwise up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "the possibility of performing exact inference without relying on evaluations of the target probability density function is an important open question .",
    "a class of exact methods , called pseudo - marginal metropolis  hastings , has been proposed in @xcite , generalizing and validating methods developed in population genetics [ @xcite ] and lattice quantum chromodynamics [ @xcite ] .",
    "pseudo - marginal methods rely on nonnegative unbiased estimators of density evaluations @xmath5 instead of the evaluations themselves . in a related manner , @xcite",
    "show that sequential monte carlo methods remain exact when the importance weights are replaced by nonnegative unbiased estimators thereof .",
    "the applicability of exact methods has thus been considerably extended since estimating @xmath5 is generally easier than evaluating it .",
    "for instance , in the common case where the cost of evaluating the likelihood function grows at least linearly with the size of the dataset , pointwise posterior density evaluations become prohibitive for large datasets but can potentially be estimated using subsampling [ @xcite ] . in state space models ,",
    "the likelihood involves an intractable integral over a latent stochastic process but can be estimated using particle filters [ @xcite ] .",
    "in other the likelihood can not be evaluated because it involves an intractable normalizing constant , such as in `` doubly intractable '' models commonly found in spatial statistics and graphical models [ @xcite ] . even for simple models and small datasets",
    ", the use of reference priors for an objective bayesian analysis leads to posterior probability density functions that can not be evaluated pointwise [ @xcite ] for they involve limits or infinite sums . in each case",
    ", exact inference can still be achieved through a pseudo - marginal approach , provided that an appropriate nonnegative unbiased estimator @xmath6 is available .",
    "generic techniques to obtain unbiased estimators from biased ones , referred to as `` debiasing techniques , '' have been developed independently in various fields and recently reviewed and generalized in @xcite , @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of debiasing techniques and pseudo - marginal methods provides a promising roadmap to perform exact inference in a very general setting .",
    "unfortunately unbiased estimators @xmath6 , as produced by current debiasing techniques , can take negative values with positive probability , even if their expectations @xmath5 are known to be nonnegative .",
    "these negative values prevent the direct use of unbiased estimators within a pseudo - marginal markov chain algorithm .",
    "likewise , standard sequential monte carlo methods can not be directly implemented when negative values can be encountered",
    ".    one might want to avoid the sign problem completely by using unbiased estimators that only take nonnegative values .",
    "in other words , one might hope to find a debiasing technique which satisfies a sign constraint .",
    "we propose to study the design of such algorithms . in section  [ subsecdebiasing ]",
    "we recall the main ideas behind debiasing techniques and highlight the connection with the bernoulli factory [ @xcite ] . in section  [ subsecapplications ]",
    "we describe applications in statistics . in section  [ secexistencegeneral ]",
    "we present a result stating the nonexistence of generic schemes to obtain nonnegative unbiased estimators . in section  [ secexistencecases ]",
    "we discuss their existence under additional conditions , which in practice require additional model - specific information .",
    "the results and further research venues are discussed in section  [ secdiscussion ] .",
    "our results are connected to the literature on debiasing techniques and bernoulli factories . in computational physics , @xcite uses a method to unbiasedly estimate some elements of the inverse of a matrix without fully inverting it , while @xcite proposes unbiased estimators of functional integrals ; both methods are inspired by an unpublished scheme of j.  von  neumann and s.  m.  ulam .",
    "a similar idea has been proposed by @xcite for estimating the derivative of a regression function and by @xcite for kernel density estimation .",
    "more recently @xcite and then @xcite ( @xcite ) have proposed a general scheme to remove the bias of a sequence of consistent estimators @xmath7 of a quantity @xmath8 , satisfying @xmath9 in equation ( [ eqmeanconsistency ] ) , the quantity @xmath10 can either be thought of as a random variable that is impossible to generate in finite time and @xmath11 as an approximation of @xmath10 , or simply as the desired , and generally unknown value @xmath12 .",
    "suppose that one can sample from @xmath11 for each @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be an integer - valued random variable that is independent of the sequence @xmath7 and that can take arbitrary large values . under mild assumptions , with the convention @xmath15 , the weights @xmath16 are such that the random sum @xmath17 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath18 .",
    "the following result gives a condition for its second moment to be finite .",
    "[ teodebiasing ] introduce a random variable @xmath10 with @xmath19 .",

    "the random variable @xmath14 could be replaced by a stopping time . since the random sum in equation ( [ eqdebias ] ) only involves an almost surely finite number of terms , the estimator @xmath27 is straightforward to simulate .    in the case",
    "where the quantity of interest @xmath18 is nonnegative , the random sum in equation ( [ eqdebias ] ) can still take negative values , even if the original estimators @xmath7 were all almost surely nonnegative ; this is because each increment @xmath28 can potentially be negative .",
    "an important exception occurs when the estimators @xmath7 are ordered , that is , @xmath29 almost surely . with exact inference in mind",
    ", one can wonder about the existence of other debiasing techniques which , unlike @xmath27 of equation ( [ eqdebias ] ) , would only yield nonnegative values .",
    "section  [ secexistencegeneral ] will introduce a framework to study that question .",
    "our framework will also be related to bernoulli factories , which have been introduced in the seminal article of @xcite . given a subset",
    "@xmath30 $ ] and a function @xmath31 $ ] , a bernoulli factory generates bernoulli random variables with success probability @xmath32 given as input an independent sequence of bernoulli random variables with success probability @xmath33 ; of course the algorithm does not have access to the value @xmath34 .",

    "it will become apparent in section  [ subseccaseinterval ] that the construction of nonnegative unbiased estimators shares many similarities with the bernoulli factory .",
    "to summarize , debiasing techniques allow us to construct unbiased estimators of generic quantities but do not ensure that the resulting estimates are nonnegative . on the other hand bernoulli factories",

    "the exponential case appears whenever log - likelihood evaluations can be unbiasedly estimated .",
    "an algorithm generating unbiased estimates of @xmath45 from a stream of unbiased estimates of @xmath18 is referred to as a _ poisson estimator _ in the literature on perfect simulation and inference for diffusion processes [ @xcite ] , and the first occurrence might be in @xcite . on a finite interval",

    "the existence of a poisson estimator allows us to transform these samples into an unbiased estimate of @xmath55 , which can then be used for exact inference .",
