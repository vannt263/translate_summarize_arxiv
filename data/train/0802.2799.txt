    "the electron transport through a single quantum dot in a two - terminal configuration is governed by the interaction energy of the electrons on the dot . in many experiments ,",
    "the state of the quantum dot is essentially characterised by the electron number since orbital degrees of freedom do not play a major role and can thus be ignored . in the limit of weak dot - lead coupling ,",
    "the resulting current is determined by states with an energy above the fermi energy of one , but below the fermi energy of the other lead .",
    "the other states suffer coulomb blockade : energy conservation together with pauli s exclusion principle preserves their occupation number and , consequently , they can not contribute to the transport . only when the dot - lead coupling becomes larger , co - tunneling processes start to play a role and suspend coulomb blockade .    when two or more quantum dots are in a linear transport arrangement between two leads , the inter - dot tunneling can be incoherent or coherent , depending on the coupling strength .",
    "incoherent tunneling is sequential , i.e.  between two tunneling events , the electrons dwell in one particular dot .",
    "coherent tunneling is found for strong inter - dot coupling such that the electrons reside in the delocalised eigenstates of the double dot .",
    "the analogy to @xmath0-electrons in molecules is reflected by the term `` artificial molecule '' .",
    "a convenient theoretical picture for coherently coupled quantum dots is a one single central system in which orbital degrees of freedom play a role .    in an unbiased double dot ,",
    "the relevant orbitals are the bonding and the anti - bonding superposition of the localised states .",
    "then an electron prepared in one dot will tunnel forth and back to the other dot with a frequency set by the tunnel splitting .",
    "these coherent oscillations can be observed by lowering after a waiting time the chemical potential of , say , the right lead .",
    "if at that stage the electron is in the right dot , it will tunnel to the right lead .",
    "periodic repetition of this procedure yields a dc current that reflects the coherent oscillations @xcite .",
    "the coherence of the superposition together with the possibility to perform a readout allows one to devise charge qubits with double quantum dots .",
    "the orbital degrees also influence the transport under microwave excitation : microwave irradiation can induce electron transitions from the ground state to an excited state and thereby enhance the electron transport between the leads , so that one observes photon - assisted tunneling @xcite .    a further common method to characterise low - dimensional semiconductor systems such as the mentioned quantum dots , are conductance measurements at low temperature : since the current changes whenever an energy level enters or leaves the voltage window , the differential conductance exhibits a corresponding peak . shifting , in addition , the energy levels by a gate voltage yields the characteristic `` coulomb diamonds '' which are observed in the differential conductance as a function of gate voltage and bias voltage . within this work ,",
    "we study both theoretically and experimentally the fingerprints of orbital degrees of freedom in the coulomb diamond structure of coherently coupled quantum dots . in section  [ sec : experiment ] , we describe our experimental setup and present transport measurements , while in section  [ sec : theory ] , we study a minimal model that exhibits the observed coulomb diamonds . moreover , we relate our theoretical findings to the experimental data .",

    ", the left channel can be depleted as well . if a negative gate voltage is applied , the channel becomes narrower until three potential barriers between the depleted areas , developed from the voltage on the gate and the wet - etched tines , are formed .",
    "now , the 1d channel is separated into shorter channels and with decreasing gate voltage it eventually evolves into small quantum dots . at a certain voltage , the so - called pinch - off , the channel is completely depleted and , consequently , no current can flow . such an evolution from 1d - channel @xcite over quantum dots ( qd ) @xcite to total depletion",

    "if one assumes a parabolic potential , the energy spacing lets us estimate the lateral dimension of @xmath23 of the dot and the diameter of @xmath24 .",

    "the most obvious one is the small area of high conductivity in the center section where the tips of conductive areas almost merge ( marked with * in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "a further interesting feature is the narrow stripes of finite conductance alongside the main areas ( marked with + ) .",
    "these mentioned areas are also rather symmetric due to bias source - drain voltage and asymmetric along the gate voltage , i.e. they appear only for lower gate voltage whereas the transition from electron transport to coulomb blockade for higher gate voltages is very sharp .",
    "the third area ( marked with # ) exhibits a high conductivity and is also symmetric in the source - drain voltage but not as a function of the gate voltage .     as a function of source - drain bias and gate voltage .",
    "blue corresponds to low conductance and red to high conductance .",

    "width=302 ]    , can be estimated from the value of @xmath28 @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "for a master equation description of electron transport at very low bias voltages , one needs to take particular care in order to avoid inconsistencies like the emergence of spurious non - vanishing transport in equilibrium situations .",
    "such problems typically arise from the approximation in the interaction representation of the coupling operator @xcite .",

    "since we aim at exploring blocking effects , the corresponding wire hamiltonian , incorporating the coulomb repulsion in the limit of a large interaction strength @xmath30 , assumes the form @xmath31 the fermion operators @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) create ( annihilate ) an electron in the orbital @xmath34 and @xmath35 denotes the respective on - site energy . in the coulomb interaction term",

    ", we employ the grand - canonical ensemble of the electrons in the leads at inverse temperature @xmath43 and with electro - chemical potentials @xmath44 .",

    "the hamiltonian describing this interaction has the form @xmath51 it will turn out that the influence of the tunnelling matrix elements is completely characterised by the spectral density @xmath52 which becomes a continuous function of @xmath53 if the lead modes are dense . if all relevant lead states are located in the centre of the conduction band , the energy - dependence of the spectral densities is not relevant and can be replaced by a constant , @xmath54 .",
    "this defines the so - called wide - band limit .",
    "the computation of stationary currents can be achieved by deriving a master equation for the dynamics of the dot electrons .",

    "the second limit refers to strong coulomb repulsion such that @xmath30 is much larger than any other energy scale of the problem .",
    "then , only the states with at most one excess electron on the wire are relevant .      in general , the relation between the states @xmath65 and the many - particle hamiltonian is established via the slater determinant .",
    "alternatively , one can resort to green s functions .",
    "in the present case , knowledge of the green s function at time @xmath66 is already sufficient . apart from a prefactor",

    "is assumed to be so large that at most one excess electron resides on the system .",
    "thus , the available hilbert space is restricted to the states @xmath72 , such that the density operator can be written as @xmath73 while the current expectation value becomes @xmath74 , \\ ] ] where @xmath75 .",
    "the decomposition of the master equation into the single - particle states @xmath76 provides for the stationary state the set of equations @xmath77 in order to fully determine the density operator , we need in addition an expression for @xmath78 which can also be derived from the master equation . a more convenient alternative is provided by the normalisation condition @xmath79 . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we remark that from the master equation   follows @xmath80 in the stationary state .      before establishing a quantitative relation between our model and the experimental results , we discuss the transport properties of the double - dot model qualitatively .",
    "thereby we reveal that both coulomb repulsion and an orbital degree of freedom play a role for the behaviour for fixed , not too small source - drain voltage while the gate voltage is changed . for very large negative values of @xmath81 , both eigenstates of the double dot lie well above the chemical potential of both leads and , thus outside the voltage window .",
    "this means that lead states being in resonance with the dot states remain unoccupied such that electron transport can only occur via co - tunnelling processes .",
    "thus , the current will be rather small .",
    "when @xmath81 becomes larger such that the lower dot level lies within the voltage window [ see figure  [ fig : explain](a ) ] , resonant transport becomes possible yielding a noticeable current .",
    "increasing the voltage further such that also the second level enters the voltage window , opens a second path for non - interacting electrons through the dots . in the case of strong coulomb repulsion , however , double occupation of the dot is impossible and , thus , the second orbital can not fully contribute to the transport . accordingly , the increase of the current is smaller .    the most significant difference between the two cases is found when only the upper level lies within the voltage window , while the lower level is below both chemical potentials , as sketched in figure  [ fig : explain](b ) .",
    "then the stationary state is characterised by an occupied lower level . whether or not a further electron can enter and cause a non - vanishing current now depends on the strength of the coulomb repulsion  for strong repulsion , transport is coulomb blocked",
    "consequently , for the two limits under investigation , we obtain a current only in the one of non - interacting electrons .",
    "this is visible as an even qualitative difference in the coulomb diamond structure of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] : the scenario for non - interacting electrons complies with particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this has the consequence that the corresponding coulomb diamond [ figure  [ fig : fig3](c ) ] is invariant under changing the sign of both the source - drain voltage and the gate voltage . for strong coulomb repulsion , by contrast",
    ", the symmetry concerning the sign of @xmath82 is no longer present ; see figure  [ fig : fig3](b ) .",
    "in particular for @xmath83 , the experimental data exhibit only one spot with high conductance , which is in clear contrast to the theoretical result for non - interacting case shown in figure  [ fig : fig3](c ) .",
    "is so large that only one level lies within the voltage window , while the other one lies well above and is never occupied .",
    "consequently , transport is interaction independent .",
    "if one level lies below both chemical potentials  ( b ) , it will occupied in the steady state and , thus , strong coulomb repulsion inhibits the electron transport.,width=264 ]    the limits of strong and zero interaction have in common that when the two energy levels enter the voltage window from above , the current increases in two steps whose separation is determined by the energy splitting @xmath84 of the two levels , i.e.  they are separated by the voltage @xmath85 .",
    "this enables one to determine the excitation energy of an orbital degree of freedom by conductance measurements .",
    "moreover , the source - drain voltage relates to the steepness of the triangle .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows again the measurement of figure  [ fig : fig3](a ) but now with the idealised diamond structure marked by dashed lines .    for a more quantitative treatment ,",
    "we compare the structure of the experimental result in figure  [ fig : fig3](a ) with the theoretical coulomb diamond in figure  [ fig : fig3](b ) .",
    "this allows one to read off the tunnel coupling @xmath86{mev}$ ] . for the slightly asymmetric lead - dot couplings @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we obtain at the plateaus for the current the values and , respectively , which is of the order of the measured values at the edges of the coulomb diamonds ( @xmath89{na}- \\unit[3]{na}$ ] ) .",
    "the quantitaive agreement between the experiment and the theoretical result for @xmath90 suggests that electrons in the relevant localised states of our sample strongly repell each other .",
    "this rises the question in which part of the sample ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) the localised states are formed . by the chemical wet etching ,",
    "the sawtooth pattern has been created and four narrow constrictions intersect the long wire into three separate regions . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , features of a one - dimensional system have been detected for less negative side gate voltages as discussed in an earlier section .",
    "this means that one of the narrower constrictions must govern the conduction process in the open channel regime , because it is unlikely , that all constrictions represent identical tunnel barriers .",
    "however , we can not identify which constriction dominates .",
    "moreover , in samples like the one used in this work , randomly distributed charged impurities from the doping process are present .",
    "they can strongly influence the potential profile depending on their position during the cooling down process @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , without further investigation , we are not able to determine in which part of the sample the relevant levels are localised . with the data from the theoretical model for strong inter - dot coupling ,",
    "we nevertheless can infer , that both dots must be rather close . for the curved shape of the etched potential into account ,",
    "a unintentionally emerged dot is very likely as well .",
    "we have studied coulomb oscillations on lateral fabricated quantum dots near the pinch - off . in order to gain a theoretical understanding , we investigated a two - site model which implies the consideration of one orbital excitation .",
    "a comparison of the measured coulomb diamond with theoretical predictions indicate that both coulomb repulsion and orbital degrees of freedom play a significant role for the transport . the importance of coulomb repulsion is emphasised by the fact that the corresponding model with non - interacting electrons makes qualitatively wrong predictions .",
    "moreover , the theoretical results allow us to gauge the gate voltage and to determine the energy splitting associated with the orbital excitation . as a drawback ,",
    "the measurement does yield any conclusion about the nature and the location of the two relevant states . studying",
    "a sample in which more orbital degrees of freedom play a dominant role might provide additional information .",
    "such experiments should be accompannied by theoretical studies for finite coulomb repulsion strength .",
