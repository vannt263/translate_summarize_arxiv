    "there are currently a number of efforts , worldwide , to directly detect wimps in terrestrial particle detectors @xcite .",
    "these are sensitive to nuclear recoils below 100 kev @xcite and take advantage of the fact that wimps , interacting primarily with atomic nuclei , would be distinguishable from the predominantly electromagnetic backgrounds present in such experiments .    while there are varying strategies in this direct detection search , liquid xenon ( lxe ) has recently come to the forefront of the field as a powerful detection medium @xcite .",
    "when particles interact in lxe , they produce prompt scintillation photons and ionization @xcite which can be measured simultaneously to infer the energy and the type of interaction .",
    "the scintillation emission spectrum from lxe is singly - peaked at 178 nm with a width of 13 nm @xcite .",
    "the _ scintillation yield _ , defined as the number of photons produced per unit energy , depends on the identity of the particle depositing the energy @xcite . since wimps primarily interact with atomic nuclei , in lxe searches the quantity of interest is the scintillation yield of recoiling xenon nuclei .",
    "the recent xenon10 measurement @xcite has pushed the energy threshold of lxe detectors down to regions where the nuclear recoil scintillation yield is poorly understood .",
    "this lack of knowledge is the source of xenon10 s largest systematic uncertainty .",

    "the scintillation yield of nuclear recoils _ relative _ to that of 122 kev gamma rays is known as the relative scintillation efficiency , or @xmath7 , and a new measurement of this energy - dependent value is reported herein . while the absolute scintillation yield of electronic recoils is not linear in energy @xcite , the 122 kev gamma rays provide an anchor point upon which one can base scintillation yields of all other energies and species .",

    "the pmts , held together with a polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) frame , form a cube such that each pmt window covers a face of the cube .",
    "both the photocathode and metal body of the pmts are held at ground potential , with positive high voltage applied to the anodes .",
    "this configuration guarantees that no residual electric fields exist in the lxe , whose scintillation yield strongly depends on the applied field @xcite ( by definition , @xmath7  is the relative light yield at zero field ) .",

    ", slowly rolling off to @xmath2490% at 10 p.e . the ej301 trigger is taken simply as the output of the discriminated signal .",
    "for the measurement of the neutrons time of flight ( tof ) the lxe trigger is fed directly to the `` start '' input of a time - to - amplitude converter ( tac ) , while the ej301 trigger provides the `` stop '' after appropriate delay .",
    "the output of the tac is digitized by the same flash adc unit .",
    "calibration of the tof signal is discussed further in section [ sec : analysis : calibration ] .",
    "the shape of the signal in the ej301 depends on the incoming particle species , and can be used to distinguish neutrons from gamma rays since the characteristic scintillation decay time is different for these particles . as a result , the tails of pulses resulting from nuclear recoils will be characteristically longer than those from electronic recoils .",
    "a description of the mechanisms involved in this process can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ej301 ,",
    "the `` slow '' component is two orders of magnitude longer than the `` fast '' component , reported to be 3.2 ns @xcite .",
    "a psd parameter is constructed by dividing the area under the pulse s tail by the total area of the pulse , with the tail defined as the part of the trace starting 30 ns after the peak until the trace reaches 5% of the peak value .",
    "the pmts were calibrated _ in situ _ with a pulsed blue led , in order to measure and monitor the gain .",

    "the relationship between the number of collected p.e .",
    "and the total number of emitted photons depends on the geometrical light collection efficiency , the quantum efficiency of the photocathodes , and the collection efficiency between the photocathode and the first dynode .",
    "although these values are not known to very high precision , they represent completely linear processes and hence lead to a linear relationship between the total number of scintillation photons and the measured number of p.e . comparing the p.e",

    "[ fig : co57 ] shows the spectrum from one such calibration .",
    "the @xmath6co yield was measured to be 19.64 @xmath21 0.07 ( stat ) @xmath21 0.11 ( sys ) p.e./kevee , where the statistical uncertainty is the combination of the parameter uncertainties of the fits from the various calibration data , and the systematic uncertainty is taken from the variation in this yield over the two - day duration of the experiment .",
    "one set of pmt gain values was applied to all data , and thus the systematic uncertainty in the @xmath6co yield quoted above accounts for both variations in yield and pmt gain .",
    "in addition to @xmath6co , data were also collected from a @xmath26na source .",
    "this source emits a @xmath27 which promptly loses energy in the na and annihilates , producing two 511 kev gamma rays emitted simultaneously in opposite directions . with the source placed between the lxe detector and the ej301 detector",

    ", @xmath26na provides a baseline tof=0 which , when used in conjunction with a variable delay generator , is used to calibrate the tof measurement system .",
    "the processing of the data acquired at each angle yields two parameters which can be used to select events of interest : the event tof , and the psd parameter from the ej301 neutron detector .",

    "the width of the tof cut is 10 ns , which is the expectation based on the spread in @xmath13 and the finite size of the detectors .",
    "the tail of the tof peak is due mainly to events where the neutron scattered in one of the detector materials in addition to the lxe , before interacting in the ej301 scintillator .",
    "multiple scatters in the lxe also add to the tail , although mc simulations indicate that their overall contribution is less than 2% .    .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : psd_tof ] that beneath the neutron peak lies a population of events which have a flat tof spectrum .",
    "these are identified as neutrons that accidentally interacted in the ej301 in coincidence with an unrelated event in the lxe , and are referred to as accidentals .",
    "as these events are uniform in tof space , accidentals outside of the tof peak should have the same energy spectrum as those within the peak .",
    "the lxe spectrum of the events inside the box of fig .",
    "[ fig : psd_tof ] labeled `` accidentals '' was used as the expectation of the accidentals background .",
    "the region to the left of the peak was chosen because the peak s extended tail contaminates the accidentals spectrum to the right of the `` neutron '' peak .",

    "referred to as materials background , mc simulations show that the spectrum of these events in the lxe follows an approximately exponential distribution in the region of the peak .",
    "[ fig : mc_spects](a ) displays the results of the mc simulation of the data set at 70.5@xmath8 , indicating the contribution from the materials background . in order to estimate the spectrum of these events in the real data , a decaying exponential was fit to the high energy portion of the distributions after subtracting the accidentals background .    after applying cuts ( psd and tof ) and subtracting backgrounds ( accidentals and materials ) , a spectrum results in which the peak from single - scatter neutrons can be readily identified , seen as the solid circles in fig .",

    "<S> liquid xenon is an important detection medium in direct dark matter experiments , which search for low - energy nuclear recoils produced by the elastic scattering of wimps with quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the two existing measurements of the relative scintillation efficiency of nuclear recoils below 20 kev lead to inconsistent extrapolations at lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a different energy scale and thus sensitivity reach of liquid xenon dark matter detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we report a new measurement of the relative scintillation efficiency below 10 kev performed with a liquid xenon scintillation detector , optimized for maximum light collection . </S>",
    "<S> greater than 95% of the interior surface of this detector was instrumented with photomultiplier tubes , giving a scintillation yield of 19.6 photoelectrons / kev electron equivalent for 122 kev gamma rays . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the relative scintillation efficiency for nuclear recoils of 5 kev is 0.14 , staying constant around this value up to 10 kev . </S>",
    "<S> for higher energy recoils we measure a value of 0.21 , consistent with previously reported data . in light of this new measurement , the xenon10 experiment s upper limits on spin - independent wimp - nucleon cross section , which were calculated assuming a constant 0.19 relative scintillation efficiency , change from @xmath0 @xmath1 to @xmath2 @xmath1 for wimps of mass 100 gev / c@xmath3 , and from @xmath4 @xmath1 to @xmath5 @xmath1 for wimps of mass 30 gev / c@xmath3 . </S>"
