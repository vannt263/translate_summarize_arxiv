    "investigation of kaon - nucleon and nucleon - hyperon interactions with hadronic probes has a long history in strangeness physics .",
    "however , the interactions involving an additional relevant kaon - hyperon channel have received marginal attention , because of lack of data .",
    "more recently , strangeness reactions are also receiving considerable attention in associated strangeness production with incident photon and electron beams . with the advent of facilities such as jlab , elsa , spring-8 , and graal , copious and high precision data on meson electromagnetic production on both nucleon and nuclear targets are becoming available .",
    "measurements of the strangeness associated production channels focus on the energy region of @xmath24 2.5 gev , corresponding to the total center - of - mass energy w@xmath252.3 gev , which cover the baryon resonances region . a result of our earlier work  @xcite on",
    "the @xmath26 reaction showed that multi - step processes , due to the coupling with the @xmath2 channel , can have as much as a @xmath27 effect on the total cross - section .",
    "to investigate very recent strangeness production data , it is necessary to extend that work , which was limited to the @xmath28 channel , to include all of the @xmath4 channels : @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "accordingly , a dynamical coupled - channel investigation of these processes requires realistic models to describe @xmath32 , and @xmath33 processes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report on our progress in this direction .",
    "the importance of developing coupled - channel approaches to meson - baryon reactions is summarized as follows :    * such an approach is required for a proper extraction of fundamental resonance decay properties , which are ultimately to be predicted by basic quark dynamics . in short , information about baryon resonance properties can only be reliably extracted within the context of an appropriate reaction theory . the importance of this interplay between extraction of fundamental information and the need for a consistent reaction theory has been emphasized by sato and lee  @xcite in the pion sector . here we extend their investigation to the kaon sector .",
    "* impressive amounts of high quality data from jlab  @xcite , elsa  @xcite , leps  @xcite , and graal  @xcite offer us the opportunity to pin down the underlying reaction mechanism and to study the role and/or properties of intervening baryon resonances .",
    "such an effort is a prerequisite for any attempt to search for missing resonances  @xcite . combining models from a chiral constituent quark formalism  @xcite with a coupled - channel approach , as presented in this work ,",
    "is expected to provide reliable insights into the elementary strangeness photo- and electro - production reactions .    in recent years , coupled - channel effects on meson - baryon reactions with strangeness production",
    "have been investigated using two approaches .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite applied a coupled - channel approach with chiral su(3 ) dynamics to investigate pion- and photon - induced meson production near the @xmath34 threshold .",
    "although their recent results  @xcite include p - wave multipoles , and thus reproduce data slightly above the threshold region , their chiral su(3 ) dynamics model can not provide the higher partial waves that are important in describing the data at higher energies .",
    "similar approaches have also been taken in refs .",
    "given the relevant w range mentioned above , their simplified dynamics represents of course only a first step .",
    "indeed , comparisons with the @xmath35 data clearly show that su(3 ) models of refs .",
    "@xcite , even when p - waves interactions are included  @xcite , greatly miss fitting the differential cross - sections : theoretical predictions produce slopes opposite to that required by the data .    the second coupled - channel approach used in the literature to investigate photon- and meson - induced reactions is based on using effective lagrangians along with a k - matrix method , developed by the giessen group  @xcite . in the @xmath36-matrix approach ,",
    "all intermediate states are put on - energy - shell and hence possibly important off - shell dynamical effects are not accounted for .",
    "the advantage of this k - matrix approach is its numerical simplicity in handling a large number of coupled channels .",
    "however , the extracted @xmath5 parameters may suffer from interpretation difficulties in terms of existing hadron models , as explicitly demonstrated in an investigation  @xcite of the @xmath37 resonance .    in this paper",
    ", we present a dynamical coupled - channel model in which the meson - baryon off - shell interactions are defined in terms of effective lagrangians .",
    "this off - shell approach is achieved by directly extending existing dynamical models  @xcite for @xmath38 scattering and pion photoproduction , to include @xmath34 channels .",
    "the main feature of our approach is that the strong interaction matrix elements of @xmath39 and @xmath40 transition operators are derived from effective lagrangians using the unitary transformation method of ref .",
    "this derivation marks our major differences with chiral su(3 ) coupled - channel models mentioned above  @xcite since it allows one to include all relevant higher partial waves and our approach is also applicable at energies way above threshold .",
    "the dynamical content of our approach is also clearly very different from the on - shell @xmath36-matrix coupled - channel models  @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to indicate more precisely , and within a more general theoretical framework , the differences between our and other approaches .",
    "similar to the well - studied meson - exchange models of @xmath41 and @xmath2 scattering , we also start with relativistic quantum field theory . with a model lagrangian , there are two approaches for deriving models of meson - baryon scattering .",
    "the most common approach  @xcite is to find an appropriate three - dimensional reduction of the ladder bethe - salpeter equation of the considered model lagrangian .",
    "meson - baryon interactions are then identified with the driving terms of the resulting three - dimensional scattering equation ; such as the blankenbecler - sugar  @xcite or gross  @xcite equations . a fairly extensive study of the three - dimensional reductions for @xmath2 scattering is given by hung _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . extending such reduction methods to derive coupled - channel equations with @xmath42 two - particle channels",
    "is straightforward .",
    "in fact , the k - matrix coupled - channel equations employed in refs .",
    "@xcite can be derived along this line if one further neglects that the principal - value parts of the meson - baryon propagators , which account for the off - shell dynamics .",
    "the scattering equations used in su(3 ) chiral models of refs .",
    "@xcite can also be derived from the ladder bethe - salpeter equation using a procedure similar to a three - dimensional reduction , although this simplification is not spelled out explicitly by the authors . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bethe - salpeter equation is solved directly , but only for the simplified case that the interaction kernel is of separable form due to the use of contact interactions .",
    "the difficulties in solving the bethe - salpeter equation , even with the ladder approximation , are well documented  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can construct models of meson - baryon interactions by deriving an effective hamiltonian @xmath43 defined in a chosen channel - space from a specific model lagrangian .",
    "the scattering equation within the considered channel - space is then governed by standard scattering theory @xmath44 where @xmath45 represent the relevant channels , @xmath46 is the s - matrix and @xmath47 is the scattering operator .",
    "here we have defined @xmath48 , with @xmath49 denoting the free hamiltonian and @xmath50 defining the interactions between considered channels .",
    "this approach for @xmath2 scattering and pion photo- and electro - production reactions has been pursued by sato and lee  @xcite .",
    "they applied the unitary transformation method of refs .",
    "@xcite to derive @xmath43 in a @xmath51 channel - space",
    ". the essential idea of the unitary transformation method we adopt is to eliminate unphysical vertex interactions @xmath52 with @xmath53 from the original field theory hamiltonian ( which can be constructed from a starting model lagrangian using the standard canonical quantization procedure ) and absorb their effects into @xmath54 two - body interactions of the resulting @xmath43 . for the @xmath2 scattering in the @xmath37 region , the resulting effective hamiltonian of the sato - lee model is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the non - resonant interaction and the @xmath37 excitation is described by the vertex interaction @xmath57 . with the hamiltonian eq.(3 ) , it is straightforward ( as explained in ref .",

    "( 1)-(2 ) .",
    "if other methods , such as the tamm - dancoff method , are chosen , the resulting effective hamiltonian could be energy - dependent , which then leads to non - trivial gauge invariant problems in applying the model to study meson photo- and electro - production reactions .",

    "<S> the resonances considered are : @xmath5 [ @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; @xmath10 [ @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; @xmath14 [ @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath17 [ @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; and @xmath20(892 ) . the basic non - resonant @xmath0 and @xmath21 transition potentials </S>",
    "<S> are derived from effective lagrangians using a unitary transformation method . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical coupled - channel equations are simplified by parametrizing the @xmath22 amplitudes in terms of empirical @xmath2 partial - wave amplitudes and a phenomenological off - shell function . </S>",
    "<S> two models have been constructed . </S>",
    "<S> model a is built by fixing all coupling constants and resonance parameters using su(3 ) symmetry , the particle data group values , and results from a constituent quark model . </S>",
    "<S> model b is obtained by allowing most of the parameters to vary around the values of model a in fitting the data . </S>",
    "<S> good fits to the available data for @xmath23 have been achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the investigated kinematics region in the center - of - mass frame goes from threshold to 2.5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the constructed models can be imbedded into associated dynamical coupled - channel studies of kaon photo- and electro - production reactions . </S>"
