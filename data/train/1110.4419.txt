    "quantum entanglement ( qe ) is the most surprising nonclassical property of quantum systems which plays a key role in quantum information and quantum computation processing@xcite . because of these applications",
    ", qe has become one of the most fascinating topics in quantum information and quantum computation . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) plays an important role in quantum integrable problem , which was originated in solving the one - dimensional @xmath1-interacting models@xcite and the statistical models@xcite .",
    "braid group representations ( bgrs ) can be obtained from ybe by giving a particular spectral parameter .",
    "bgrs of two and three eigenvalues have direct relationship with temperley - lieb algebra ( tla)@xcite and birman - wenzl - murakami algebra ( bwma)@xcite respectively .",
    "tla and bwma have been widely used to construct the solutions of ybe@xcite .",
    "the tla first appeared in statistical mechanics as a tool to analyze various interrelated lattice models@xcite and was related to link and knot invariants@xcite . in the subsequent developments tla is related to knot theory , topological quantum field theory , statistical physics , quantum teleportation , entangle swapping and universal quantum computation@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the bwma@xcite including braid algebra and tla was first defined and independently studied by birman , wenzl and murakami .",
    "it was designed partially help to understand kauffman s polynomial in knot theory .",
    "recently , ref.@xcite applied topological basis states for spin-1/2 system to recast 4-dimensional ybe into its 2-dimensional counterpart . as we know , few studies have reported topological basis states for spin-1 system .",
    "the motivation for our works is to find topological basis states for spin-1 system and study the topological basis states .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : one is that we construct a family of @xmath2-matrix representations of bwma ; the other concerns topological basis states for spin-1 system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we use entangled states to construct the @xmath0 matrix representations of tla , then we present a family of @xmath2-matrix representations of bwma , and study the entangled states . in sec . 3 ,",
    "we obtain three topological basis states of bwma , and we recast nine - dimensional bwma into its three - dimensional counterpart .",
    "we end with a summary .",
    "the @xmath3 hermitian matrix @xmath4 , which satisfies tla and can construct the well - known six - vertex model@xcite , takes the representation @xmath5    where @xmath6 with @xmath7 being any flux .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath4 as that    @xmath8    where @xmath9 .",
    "so like this symmetrical method , we found the @xmath2 hermitian matrices @xmath4 s , which satisfies tla , take the representations as follows @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "recently , a @xmath2matrix representation of bwma has been presented@xcite .",
    "we notice that @xmath4 is the same as gou _ _ et.al.__@xcite presented , when @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    as we know",
    "the bwma relations@xcite including braid relations and tla relations satisfy the following relations , @xmath19 where @xmath20 satisfy the braid relations , @xmath21 satisfy the tla relations @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is topological parameter in the knot theory which does not depend on the sites of lattices .",
    "we denote @xmath24 and @xmath25 throughout the text .",
    "the notations @xmath26 and @xmath27 are used , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are abbreviation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , and @xmath32 represents the unit matrix of the @xmath33-th particle .    following the matrix representation of tla",
    "we obtain a family of @xmath2-matrix representations of bwma as follows @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    it is worth noticing that the states @xmath37 s are entangled states . by means of negativity , we study these entangled states . the negativity for two qutrits is given by , @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the trace norm of @xmath40 , which denotes the partial transpose of the bipartite state @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath42 corresponds to the absolute value of the sum of negative eigenvalues of @xmath40 , and negativity vanishes for unentangled states@xcite . by calculation , we can obtain the negativity of states @xmath37 s as @xmath43 where @xmath11 .",
    "the fig.[fig : neg ] corresponds to the negativity @xmath44 .",
    "one demonstrates that the states @xmath37 s become maximally entangled states of two qutrits as @xmath45 when @xmath46 .     versus the parameter @xmath47.),width=377 ]",
    "in the topological quantum computation theory , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) braid behavior under the exchange of anyons@xcite has been investigated based on the @xmath48 fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe)@xcite . the orthogonal topological basis states read@xcite @xmath49 where the parameter @xmath50 represents the values of a unknotted loop . in eq .",
    "there are two topological graphics @xmath51{uu}}}$ ] and @xmath51{uinu}}}$ ] . for four lattices , we can easy find four graphics @xmath51{uu}}}$ ] , @xmath51{uinu}}}$ ] , @xmath51{usu}}}$ ] , @xmath51{usiu}}}$ ] .",
    "if we use skein relations @xmath51{s}}}=q^{1/2}{\\raisebox{-0.4\\height}{\\includegraphics[height=0.5cm]{ii}}}+q^{-1/2}{\\raisebox{-0.4\\height}{\\includegraphics[height=0.7cm]{un}}}$ ] ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath51{si}}}=q^{-1/2}{\\raisebox{-0.4\\height}{\\includegraphics[height=0.5cm]{ii}}}+q^{1/2}{\\raisebox{-0.4\\height}{\\includegraphics[height=0.7cm]{un}}}$ ] ( @xmath53 ) , where the unknotted loop @xmath54{d}}}=-q - q^{-1}$ ] , the third and the fourth graphics recast to @xmath51{uu}}}$ ] and @xmath51{uinu}}}$ ] ( @xmath51{usu}}}=q^{1/2}{\\raisebox{-0.4\\height}{\\includegraphics[height=0.5cm]{uu}}}+q^{-1/2}{\\raisebox{-0.4\\height}{\\includegraphics[height=0.5cm]{uinu}}}$ ] , @xmath51{usiu}}}=q^{-1/2}{\\raisebox{-0.4\\height}{\\includegraphics[height=0.5cm]{uu}}}+q^{1/2}{\\raisebox{-0.4\\height}{\\includegraphics[height=0.5cm]{uinu}}}$ ] ) .",
    "so the topological basis states are self - consistent .",
    "but in this paper , we focus on bwma , the braid group representations ( @xmath55 ) is independent of tla representations ( @xmath4 ) , and in bwma @xmath56 .",
