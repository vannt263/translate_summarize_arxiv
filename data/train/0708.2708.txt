    "two - proton knockout reactions using intermediate - energy heavy - ion beams have been successfully used to explore the structure of neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that these reactions can be considered direct reactions .",
    "spectroscopic factors can then be extracted from the longitudinal momentum distribution of the residual fragment .",
    "spectroscopic factors of excited states can be extracted by @xmath5-ray coincidence measurements .",
    "nuclei close to the dripline have very few if any bound excited states .",
    "the structure of these nuclei can be explored with neutron - decay spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the shell structure along the oxygen isotopes is of particular interest @xcite .",
    "the two heaviest particle - bound oxygen isotopes @xmath3o and @xmath4o do not have any bound excited states @xcite .",
    "the mona collaboration has recently used the two - proton knockout reaction from @xmath1ne to populate excited states in @xmath4o and @xmath3o @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university .",
    "the secondary beam of 86  mev/@xmath6 was produced from a primary @xmath7ar beam .",
    "the two - proton knockout reaction occurred in a 721 mg/@xmath8 be target located in front of a large - gap sweeper magnet @xcite .",
    "the oxygen isotopes were detected and identified behind the magnet .",
    "neutrons around zero degrees were measured in coincidence with the modular neutron array ( mona ) @xcite .",
    "the details of the fragment production and separation as well as the experimental setup can be found in references @xcite .",
    "the decay energies of resonances were reconstructed by the invariant mass method from the measured oxygen and neutron energies and the opening angle between the oxygen and the neutron .",
    "the angle and energy of the fragments were ion - optically reconstructed using a novel method which takes into account the position at the target in the dispersive direction @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the reconstructed decay energy spectrum of excited @xmath4o .",
    "no obvious resonance structure is apparent .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a background contribution simulated by a thermal distribution with a temperature of 1.7 mev .",
    "in contrast , the decay energy spectrum of @xmath3o shown in figure [ fig2 ] shows a sharp resonance structure very close to threshold @xcite .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a fit with a resonance at 45(2 ) kev and a background contribution with a temperature of 0.7 mev . with a neutron separation energy of 2.74(13 ) mev @xcite this corresponds to a state at an excitation energy of 2.79(13 ) mev .",
    "the state is interpreted as the @xmath9 state due to the single particle hole in the @xmath10 configuration .",
    "the @xmath11 state recently observed for the first time in the reaction @xmath12o(d , p)@xmath3o @xcite was not observed .    the absence of excited states in @xmath4o and the selective population of the @xmath9 state in @xmath3o can be explained with the assumption of a direct knockout reaction and the structure of @xmath1ne .",
    "the knockout of the two valence protons ( @xmath13 ) from @xmath1ne will populate the particle - bound ground - state of @xmath4o .",
    "the spectroscopic factor for the population of the unbound @xmath14 state from this reaction is predicted to be quite small @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that this state was not observed in the present reaction .",
    "the population of the @xmath9 state in @xmath3o is the result of a different two - proton knockout reaction . instead of the knockout of the two @xmath13 protons ,",
    "the knockout involves one of the core @xmath15 protons in addition to one of the valence @xmath13 protons leaving the system in a neutron - unbound excited state .",
    "the corresponding one proton ( inner shell ) knockout from various fluorine isotopes was used to explain the cross section of the population of neutron - rich oxygen isotopes @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the excitation energy spectrum of this knockout scenario and the subsequent decay to the excited state of @xmath3o , whose neutron decay to @xmath12o is then detected in the present experiment .",
    "the selective population of the @xmath9 is due to the mixing of the excited proton configuration with neutron excitations .",
    "the proton configuration ( @xmath16 ) can mix with the neutron excitations of the form @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the first of these has large spectroscopic overlap with high - lying negative - parity excitations in @xmath3o ; the other two will excite one neutron ( either a @xmath20 or a @xmath21 ) to the continuum of the _ fp_-shell .",
    "the current setup is not geometrically efficient for the detection of these high - energy neutrons which probably contribute to the non - resonant background .",
    "the resulting @xmath3o is then in the @xmath22 ground state or the @xmath9 excited state .",
    "the subsequent neutron decay of the @xmath9 state is the resonance observed in the present experiment .",
    "these different scenarios and the possible direct three - particle 2@xmath231@xmath24 knockout is further described in references @xcite .    in this reaction mechanism",
    "the @xmath25 configuration is not populated and thus the recently observed @xmath11 ( particle ) state @xcite is not populated in our experiment .",
    "the experiments are complementary because the present knockout reactions are sensitive to hole states while the single - neutron transfer reaction @xmath12o(d , p)@xmath3o@xmath26 of reference @xcite is predominantly sensitive to particle states .",
    "a two - proton knockout reaction was successfully used to populate neutron - unbound states in @xmath3o .",
    "in contrast to the population of bound excited states that are predominantly populated from the knock - out of valence protons , the population of neutron - unbound states involves the knock - out of inner shell protons .",
    "the mixing of these deep - hole proton states with neutron states leads to the emission of a continuum neutron .",
    "the non - observation of any excited states in @xmath4o and the 3/2@xmath27 particle state in @xmath3o and the observation of the 5/2@xmath27 hole state in @xmath3o are consistent with this reaction mechanism .",
    "this new reaction mechanism offers the opportunity to explore excited states in neutron - rich nuclei that might not be accessible with any other method .",
