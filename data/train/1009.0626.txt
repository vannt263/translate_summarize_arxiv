    "the classical secretary problem is a well known optimal stopping problem from probability theory .",
    "it is usually described by different real life examples , notably the process of hiring a secretary .",
    "imagine a company manager in need of a secretary .",
    "our manager wants to hire only the best secretary from a given set of @xmath1 candidates , where @xmath1 is known .",
    "no candidate is equally as qualified as another .",
    "the manager decides to interview the candidates one by one in a random fashion .",
    "every time he has interviewed a candidate he has to decide immediately whether to hire her or to reject her and interview the next one . during the interview process he can only judge the qualities of those candidates he has already interviewed .",
    "this means that for every candidate he has observed , there might be an even better qualified one within the set of candidates yet to be observed .",
    "of course the idea is that by the time only a small number of candidates remain unobserved , a recently interviewed candidate that is relatively best will probably also be the overall best candidate .",
    "there is abundant research literature on this classical secretary problem , for which we refer to ferguson @xcite for an historical note and an extensive bibliography .",
    "the exact optimal policy is known , and may be derived by various methods , see for instance dynkin and yushkevich @xcite , and gilbert and mosteller @xcite .",
    "also , many variations and generalizations of the original problem have been introduced and analysed .",
    "one of these generalizations is the focus of our paper , namely the problem to select one of the @xmath0 best , where @xmath4 is some preassigned number ( notice that @xmath5 is the classical secretary problem ) .",
    "originally , this problem was introduced by gusein - zade @xcite , who derived the structure of the optimal policy : there is a sequence @xmath6 of position thresholds such that when candidate @xmath7 is presented , and judged to have relative rank @xmath8 among the first @xmath7 candidates , with rank 1 being the best , rank 2 being second best , etc . ]",
    ", then the optimal decision says @xmath9 furthermore , @xcite gave an algorithm to compute these thresholds , and derived asymptotic expressions ( as @xmath3 ) for the @xmath10 case .",
    "also frank and samuels @xcite proposed an algorithm , and gave the limiting ( as @xmath3 ) probabilities and limiting proportional thresholds @xmath11 .",
    "the algorithms of @xcite are based on dynamic programming , which means that the optimal thresholds @xmath12 , and the optimal winning probability are determined numerically .",
    "the next interest was to find analytic expressions .",
    "to our best knowledge , this has been resolved only for @xmath10 by gilbert and mosteller @xcite , and for @xmath13 by quine and law @xcite .",
    "although the latter claim that their approach is applicable to produce exact results for any @xmath0 , it is clear that the expressions become rather untractable for larger @xmath0 .",
    "this has inspired us to develop approximate results for larger @xmath0 .",
    "we consider two approximate policies for the general @xmath0 case : single - level policies , and double - level policies .",
    "a single - level policy is given by a single position threshold @xmath14 in conjuction with a rank level @xmath15 , such that when candidate @xmath7 is presented , and judged to have relative rank @xmath8 among the first @xmath7 candidates , then the policy says @xmath16 a double - level policy is given by two position thresholds @xmath17 in conjuction with two rank levels @xmath18 , such that when candidate @xmath7 is presented , and judged to have relative rank @xmath8 among the first @xmath7 candidates , then the policy says @xmath19 we shall derive the exact winning probability for these two approximate policies , when the threshold and level parameters are given .",
    "these expressions can then used easily to compute the optimal single - level and the optimal double - level policies , i.e. , we optimize the winning probabilities ( under these level policies ) with respect to their threshold and level parameters .",
    "the most important result is that the winning probabilities of the optimal double - level policies are extremely close to the winning probabilities of the optimal policies ( with the @xmath0 thresholds ) , specifically for larger @xmath0 . in other words",
    ", we have found explicit formulas that approximate closely the winning probabilities for this generalized secretary problem . as an example , we present in table [ t : resdlp ] the relative errors in percentages for a few @xmath20 combinations ( a more extended table can be found in section [ s : num ] ) .",

    "for the considered generalized secretary problem of selecting one of the @xmath21 best out of a group of @xmath22 we have obtained closed expressions for the probability of success for all possible single- and double - level policies . for",
    "any given finite values of @xmath22 and @xmath21 these expressions can be used to obtain the optimal single - level policy respectively optimal double - level policy in a straightforward manner .",
    "moreover , asymptotically for @xmath23 we have also obtained closed expressions for the winning probability for relevant families of single - level and double - level policies .",
    "optimizing this expression for the family of single - level policies an asymptotic optimal rank level @xmath24 and corresponding optimal position threshold fraction @xmath25 and asymptotic winning probability are easily obtained .",
    "similarly we have done such asymptotic analysis and optimization for the relevant family of double - level policies . both for the single - level and double - level policies we confirmed numerically for @xmath26 that the winning probabilities for optimal finite and double level policies for finite values of @xmath22 converge if @xmath22 increases to the ( respectively single - level and double - level ) optimal asymptotic winning probabilities .    finally , we computed for varying @xmath21 and @xmath22 the optimal single - level and double - level policies and corresponding winning probabilities and compared the results to the overall optimal policy which is determined by @xmath21 position thresholds .",
    "we found that the single - level policies and especially the double - level policies perform nearly as well as the overall optimal policy .",
    "in particular for a generalized secretary problem with a larger value of @xmath21 applying the optimal single - level or double - level policy could be considered , because implementation of the overall optimal policy using @xmath21 different thresholds is unattractive compared to using only one or two thresholds for implementing the policy .",
    "besides for large @xmath21 the gain in performance of the overall optimal policy over the optimal double - level policy is very small .    999    dynkin , e.b . and yushkevich , a. 1969 .",
