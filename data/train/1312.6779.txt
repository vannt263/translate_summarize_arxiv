    "in some cases the black hole mass is measured ( or the upper limit is found ) in the same galaxy where the nuclear cluster is observed . it allows to compare directly the ratios of their masses @xmath4/@xmath3 .",
    "this ratio is compared with the color index ( @xmath2 ) of parent galaxies in fig .",
    "it demonstrates that in most cases the mass of smbh exceed the nc mass , although for `` red '' galaxies with relatively large color index we have the opposite .",
    "this difference does not imply that massive black holes grow faster in `` red '' galaxies , rather it reflects the known fact that the mass range for ncs is much narrower than for smbhs .",
    "the most essential here is the kind of bi - modality : there are practically no massive black holes among the `` blue '' galaxies .",
    "may they be `` blue '' just because the mass @xmath4 is not high enough ?",
    "it is essential that that in all diagrams we considered for @xmath4 ( however not for @xmath10 ! )",

    "the total ( virial ) mass of the dark halo is determined by the circular velocity at the virial radius , which is close to @xmath0 .",
    "so the relationship between the masses of the central objects , @xmath4 or @xmath3 , and @xmath0 is of special interest .",
    "the connection between the smbh or nc masses and galactic circular velocities has been considered in a number of studies , but the results are contradictory ( see ( * ? ? ? * kormendy et al .",

    "the tight correlation @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath0 for disk galaxies found in some studies is evidently the result of using the indirect estimates of @xmath4 , based on their statistical dependencies on the central stellar - velocity dispersion ( see the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",

    "`` red '' and `` blue '' galaxies are shown by the empty and filled symbols respectively .",
    "the diagrams show that the masses of both ncs and smbhs correlate with the velocities of rotation , but the link between the mass and rotation is tighter for nuclear clusters than for black holes .",
    "it is essential , that the `` red '' and `` blue '' galaxies are not separated in the nc plot , however they occupy distinct regions in the diagram for smbhs : the `` red '' galaxies ( in fig .",
    "2b these are mostly lenticular galaxies ) possess more massive black holes than the `` blue '' ones with the same @xmath0 .",
    "similar conclusions follow from a comparison of the mass of central objects with the total ( indicative ) mass of a galaxy within the optical diameter @xmath13 , defied as @xmath14/2 g ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "unlike @xmath4 , the @xmath3 values for galaxies of both color groups form a unified sequence in all diagrams we considered .",
    "the bimodal nature of color - index distribution of the observed galaxies indicates that the transition of galaxies from the blue to the red sequence must occur fairly quickly , at some stage of the evolution .",

    "the efficient mechanism that can halt star formation in massive galaxies is the burst of agn activity , which sweeps a gas out of the inner regions , which may be associated with galaxy mergers ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is important that the `` red '' and `` blue '' galaxies are not distinguished on the diagrams where the nc masses are compared with the rotation velocity @xmath0 , or dynamic mass of the host galaxies ( see above ) , just as with mass of stellar population , or with the velocity of rotation at a fixed distance from the nucleus ( not shown here ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zasov & cherepashchuk ( 2013 ) ) ) . in turn ,",
    "correlations of @xmath4 with the integral properties of patent galaxies have a different character : they are much looser and steeper than for @xmath3",
    ". moreover , smbhs , unlike ncs , are usually more massive in the red - group galaxies , than in the blue - group galaxies , even if they have similar rotation velocities and masses .",
    "it agrees well with a scenario in which the decrease of star formation rate which makes a galaxy  red  is the result of large mass of smbh , which inspires a high nuclear activity at an early stage of the galaxy s evolution , and ? as a result , moves a galaxy into the passively evolving red sequence .",
    "judging from the observed @xmath4 values for the `` red '' galaxies , the smbh mass must exceed a few @xmath15 to halt star formation , with a higher @xmath4 threshold required for more massive galaxies .",
    "the impact of active nucleus on the ncs is not entirely clear , however it is obvious that the burst of activity may halt the rapid growth phase of both smbh and nc . since @xmath10 for red - group and blue - group galaxies correlate with the parent galaxy properties in a similar way , it follows that the nuclear clusters of the `` red '' galaxies either managed to avoid the destruction during the active phase of nucleus , or ( which is more likely ) they began their active growth after this violent event , which gave them possibility to evolve in a similar way in the `` red '' and `` blue '' galaxies ."
