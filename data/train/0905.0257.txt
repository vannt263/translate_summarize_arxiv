    "however , the increased damping itself would be evidence of the excitation of second sound .    a more direct way to excite second sound could be realized by generating a heat perturbation .",
    "for example , a laser tuned close to an optical resonance will heat the gas .",
    "the use of two intensity - modulated counter - propagating beams will produce a periodic heat perturbation , resulting in an additional position and time dependent term in ( [ cont ] ) for the entropy density , leading to the excitation of second sound and generation of a large temperature fluctuations when the frequency and the wavelength of the perturbation are in resonance with the second sound dispersion",

    "<S> using a variational approach , we solve the equations of two - fluid hydrodynamics for a uniform and trapped fermi gas at unitarity . in the uniform case , we find that the first and second sound modes are remarkably similar to those in superfluid helium , a consequence of strong interactions . in the presence of harmonic trapping , </S>",
