    "blazars are believed to be active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with relativistic jets pointing toward us ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "doppler - boosted non - thermal emission from the jet dominates from radio to @xmath1-rays in blazars .",
    "the radio  optical emission is dominated by synchrotron emission , and hence , highly polarized .",
    "polarimetric observations have been extensively performed since they provide a clue for the structure of magnetic field in the jet ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another important feature of blazars is a violent variability in a wide range of time - scales from a few minutes to years ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since the polarization degree ( pd ) and angle ( pa ) are also variable with time , dense and long - term polarimetric observations are essential to understand the variation mechanism of blazars and the magnetic field structure in the jet .",
    "@xcite conducted an intensive observation campaign for bl  lac with multi - longitude optical observatories over a week period , and found that the polarization changes trace out a random walk in the stokes @xmath2 plane .",
    "in general , erratic variations have been observed in polarization of most blazars ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "systematic variations in pd and pa were also occasionally detected in blazars , for example , flares associated with the increase of pd ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the color variation correlating with the variation in pd ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have recently reported a smooth rotation of the polarization vector in bl  lac , which indicates a propagation of the emitting region through a helical magnetic field in the jet .",
    "thus , both erratic and systematic variations of polarization have been observed in blazars .",
    "the erratic variation of the polarization vector can be explained by a scenario that a number of independent sources with randomly oriented and strong polarizations blink ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the systematic variations are , however , difficult to be explained only by the random variation .",
    "alternatively , a number of systematic variations can be apparently overlooked in pd and pa if short - term polarization variations are superimposed on a long - term polarization trend .",
    "a schematic example is shown in figure  [ fig : example ] .",
    "the upper and lower panels show the light curve of the total and polarized fluxes and the temporal variation of the polarization vector in the stokes @xmath2 plane , respectively . in this example",
    ", the polarization vector is assumed to be a superposition of two components ; one shows a short - term variation associated with a flare of the total flux , and the other is a long - term trend . in the case",
    "that there is no long - term trend , pf correlates with the total flux , independent of the pa of the short - term flare . in the case that the long - term trend has a significant pf as shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : example ] , however , the pf can show no positive correlation with the light curve",
    ". if the pa of the short - term flare is random and observations are sparse , the variation of polarization can be apparently erratic .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)quexam.eps    the presence of the long - term component has been suggested by several observations .",
    "the short - term variability of blazars is characterized by a combination of shots ( @xcite ) .",
    "a typical time - scale of the shot was estimated to be @xmath3  d ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to these short - term variations , it is well known that blazars show variations with a time - scale of months  years .",
    "it is possible that the long- and short - term variation components have different polarization features .",
    "@xcite reported vlbi radio observations of blazars , which show two or more components in polarization maps .",
    "if the polarization components in the radio range can be observed also in the optical range , an observed optical polarization vector should be a composition of those distinct radio polarization components since the angular resolution of optical observations is much lower than that of vlbi radio images .",
    "@xcite reported a long polarimetric monitoring of bl  lac in 19691991 , and found the existence of the preferred direction of the polarization vector .",
    "they propose a model that the polarization of bl  lac has two kinds of sources , a stationary component and a large number of randomly polarized components ( also see , @xcite ) .",
    "this stationary component could be considered as a long - term trend if it varies gradually .",
    "the two - component model shown in figure  [ fig : example ] is one of the simplest one among models with multiple polarization components .",
    "it deserves further investigation if such a simple model can extract a systematic trend from erratic variations of polarization in blazars . here",
    ", we present an exploratory bayesian approach to separate a long - term trend from observed temporal variations of polarization in blazars . a description of the model and method is shown in the next section .",
    "we apply the model to observed photopolarimetric data of blazars and discuss the implications of the results in section  3 .",
    "in section  4 , we discuss the validity of the model and results .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section  5 .",
    "we assume following three conditions for the observed flux and polarization in blazars .",
    "i ) an observed polarization vector is a superposition of two distinct polarization vectors of long- and short - term variation components .",
    "ii ) the short - term component is responsible for observed variations of the total flux . in other words ,",
    "the pf of the short - term component completely correlates with the light curve of the total flux .",
    "iii ) temporal variations of the flux from the long - term component is small . condition ii ) is based on the fact that several flares of blazars are associated with the increase of pf , as mentioned in section  1 . in our picture ,",
    "all flares are associated with pf flares although each variation is often hidden in the observed pf because of the presence of the stronger , long - term component .",
    "condition iii ) is made just for simplicity of calculation .",
    "it is difficult to separate the short- and long - term components simultaneously in both the light curve and the polarization vector in our model .",
    "since stokes parameters are additive , condition i ) can be expressed with stokes parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denote the linear polarization parameters of the observed , long- , and short - term components , respectively .",
    "the short - term component @xmath9 is determined when @xmath8 is given for @xmath7 .",
    "pf , pd and pa are calculated as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "bayesian statistics provides a method to estimate a posterior probability density function ( pdf ) of model parameters from a likelihood function defined by the model and the data and a prior pdf of the model parameters .",
    "we develop a bayesian model to estimate a time - series of @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the long - term trend , that is , @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "we use @xmath15 sets of photopolarimetric observations , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the observed total flux . according to the bayesian theorem ,",
    "the posterior distribution of @xmath18 is calculated as : @xmath19 where c is a constant for normalization of pdf . here ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the likelihood function and the prior distribution of @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the likelihood function , @xmath20 , is defined based on our assumed condition ii ) and iii ) .",
    "the pf of the short - term component can be calculated as @xmath22 .",
    "we normalized @xmath17 and @xmath23 using the , so - called , `` z - score '' transformation defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the normalized and original parameter values , its average , and standard deviation , respectively .",
    "this normalization procedure reduces the uncertainty of a possible contribution of the long - term component to the total flux if the contribution is time - independent as assumed in condition iii ) .",
    "the likelihood function is , then , defined with these normalized parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the error for @xmath30 . @xmath32 is approximately given by the error of the observed pf .",
    "we neglected the error of @xmath17 because photometric errors of the total fluxes are much smaller than the errors of polarization parameters .",
    "@xmath20 reaches the maximum when the profile of the light curve is the same as that of @xmath23 .",
    "the prior distribution , @xmath21 , plays a role in the control of the time - scale of the long - term trend in our model .",
    "our model requires that the variation time - scale of @xmath8 is longer than that of @xmath9 .",
    "a long - term variation definitely draws a smoother path than that of short - term variations .",
    "a smooth curve can be described by a condition that a sequence of the first difference of @xmath33 and @xmath34 follows a standard normal distribution .",
    "we define the prior distribution as follows ; @xmath35 @xmath21 has no physical meaning in our model .",
    "it only controls the smoothness of the long - term trend by a hyperparameter , @xmath36 .",
    "the result obtained with this model evidently depends on @xmath36 .",
    "we determine an appropriate @xmath36 using so - called `` empirical bayesian '' approach , by making a criterion for obtained results , which are discussed in subsection  2.3 and subsection  4.1 .",
    "the hyperparameter , @xmath36 , has the same dimension as @xmath4 and @xmath5 . since @xmath36 corresponds to a standard deviation of a normal distribution as can be seen in equations  ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ,",
    "it is useful to use @xmath36 normalized by a typical observation error of @xmath2 , @xmath37 ; @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the observation error of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . in subsection  3.2",
    ", we discuss the dependence of the result on @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we can calculate @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath18 using the observations , @xmath44 .",
    "the posterior probability , @xmath45 , was then estimated based on equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "the estimation was performed with the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method with the metropolis algorithm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation procedure of mcmc is as follows : at the @xmath46-th step of mcmc , we obtain @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "we then randomly move to another point in the parameter space of @xmath18 by adding random values drawn from a standard normal distribution which has a dispersion chosen to efficiently sample the likelihood surface . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath49 .",
    "we count the @xmath50-th step if either @xmath51 or @xmath52 is larger than a uniform random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "otherwise , we reject it and rework the @xmath50-th step .",
    "after discarding the first @xmath53 steps , we sample every 100 steps until the number of the sample becomes @xmath54 .",
    "this procedure forms a set of @xmath18 , and we obtained ten sets of @xmath18 with different initial values of @xmath18 .",
    "we confirmed that no significant difference was seen in each set of @xmath18 .",
    "we merged them , and finally , obtained the mcmc sample of @xmath18 . the median and 68.3% confidence intervals for @xmath18",
    "were determined from this combined sample .      in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate how our bayesian model works using artificial data sets .",
    "we generated five sets of artificial data of temporal @xmath2 variations and light curves .",
    "each data set consists of 100 sets of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath55 in a time - series from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the duration and amplitude of the short - term flare were fixed in the light curve and pf as @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "errors of @xmath4 and @xmath5 were set to be 1.0 .",
    "we used simple linear functions for brightening and fading phases of the flare .",
    "figure  [ fig : example ] shows an example of the flare",
    ". results of our analysis are independent of the flux out of the flare since the light curve is normalized in our procedure , as mentioned above .",
    "the short - term flares were randomly generated in the time and pa .",
    "the frequency of the flare was controlled with a parameter , @xmath61 , which is a probability that a flare occurs at each time .",
    "overlaps of flares were allowed .",

    "we assumed sine - curves for the long - term trend , as depicted in the left panels of figure  [ fig : simqu ] .",

    "the estimated long - term trends were shown in the right panels of figure  [ fig : simqu ] , indicated by the filled circles .",
    "typical errors of @xmath64 are also shown in each panel .",
    "the temporal variations of @xmath23 are shown in the right panels in figure  [ fig : simlc ] .",
    "data ( a ) was generated with a low flare frequency of @xmath65 .",
    "the second and forth flares apparently have larger amplitudes than the others in the light curve because two consecutive flares are incidentally overlapped .",
    "a sign of the assumed long - term trend can be seen in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : simqu ] because of the low flare frequency .",
    "the observed pf apparently shows anti - correlations with the light curve in the flares of @xmath66 , while positive correlations are seen in @xmath67 .",
    "this is because the long - term trend has a significant polarization , and the polarization vectors of the early flares , incidentally , directed to the origin of the @xmath2 plane .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : simqu ] , the bayesian model well reproduced the assumed long - term trend .",
    "the corrected @xmath23 shows a clear correlation with the light curve in all period , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : simlc ] .",
    "data ( b ) was generated from data  ( a ) by random sampling .",
    "we `` observed '' data  ( a ) with an observation probability of 50  % .",
    "this data is used in order to evaluate the bayesian model for data taken with unequal time intervals , like typical ground - based observations of blazars .",
    "this experiment is important because the prior distribution in our model assumes data observed with equally - spaced intervals .",
    "the estimated @xmath23 still shows a clear correlation with the light curve .",
    "the estimated long - term trend is somewhat smoother than the assumed one , while it successfully reproduces general features of the assumed trend .",
    "data ( c ) is an example for data with a low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "we generated @xmath4 and @xmath5 of data  ( c ) by adding a gaussian noise to those of data  ( a ) with standard deviations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 of 2.3 .",
    "this corresponds to s / n@xmath68 for each polarization flare having an amplitude of @xmath60 .",
    "the estimated long - term component still shows a general trend of increasing @xmath5 , while the `` s''-shaped profile is weak .",
    "the correlation between the light curve and pf is improved even in the case that this long - term trend is subtracted , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : simlc ] .",
    "this is probably because the sub - structure of the assumed long - term trend is negligible compared with the flares having a large amplitude in this case .",
    "we confirmed that the estimation of the long - term trend was completely failed if the standard deviation of the gaussian noise was 3.5 ( s / n@xmath69 ) . in the case of a standard deviation of 1.8 ( s / n@xmath70 ) ,",
    "the long - term trend was well reproduced .",
    "hence , our model is validated if polarization flares are detected with s / n@xmath71 in the case of data  ( a ) . in general , the allowable s / n highly depends on the data itself .",
    "it is possible that a higher s / n is required for data with a higher flare - frequency .",
    "data ( d ) shows more complicated temporal variations .",
    "it was generated with a high flare frequency of @xmath72 , and a more prominent long - term trend .",
    "almost no characteristic of the long - term trend is seen in the middle panel of data  ( c ) in figure  [ fig : simqu ] , and the path in the @xmath2 plane is apparently erratic as generally observed in blazars .",
    "nevertheless , the long - term trend was successfully reproduced by the bayesian model , as seen in the right panel of figure  [ fig : simqu ] .",
    "while there is no significant correlation between the observed pf and the light curve , the correlation coefficient between @xmath23 and the light curve is calculated to be @xmath73 .",
    "this demonstrates that the bayesian method can be a powerful tool for the analysis of apparently erratic variations in polarization .",
    "we note that residuals between @xmath23 and the light curve are larger than those in the case of data  ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this indicates that the bayesian model possibly fails to reproduce the long - term trend in the case of a very high flare frequency .    in data ( e )",
    ", there is no association between the light curve and the polarization parameters .",
    "the light curve was generated in the same way as in the other cases with @xmath74 .",
    "the variation of the polarization vector was set to be a purely random walk in the @xmath2 plane without a long - term trend .",
    "the bayesian model found a solution of the long - term trend even in this case , as shown in the right panel of data  ( d ) in figure  [ fig : simqu ] . on the other hand",
    ", there is no significant correlation between the estimated @xmath23 and the light curve .",
    "this suggests that the model can not extract any meaningful long - term trend from data  ( d ) .      in the last section",
    ", we demonstrated that the bayesian model successfully reproduced the assumed long - term trends in the @xmath2 plane for the artificial data .",
    "it can , however , generate a false long - term trend even from the data in which no long - term trend was actually present .",
    "this is problematic for the application of this model to real observations in which we have no information about the presence of the long - term trend .",
    "hence , we need to make a criterion for the validation of obtained results from the bayesian model .",
    "we also need to determine the preferable range of the hyperparameter , @xmath36 , because the result depends on @xmath36 . in general , a hyperparameter in an empirical bayesian model can be estimated by maximizing marginal likelihood .",
    "this standard method is , however , insufficient in our model , as discussed in subsection  4.1 . here",
    ", we make a specific criterion for our model .",
    "first , the correlation of @xmath23 and the light curve should be significantly improved compared with that of the observed pf and the light curve .",
    "the significance of the difference in two correlation coefficients is evaluated by @xmath75-test . using two correlation coefficients , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 or 2 ) , the test statistic , @xmath75 , which has a standard normal distribution ,",
    "is defined as follows : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the number of samples .",
    "we can conclude that the two correlation coefficients are significantly different with a @xmath80  % confidence level when @xmath81 . in our bayesian model , a smaller @xmath36 yields a smoother long - term trend , and hence results in a less improvement in the correlation coefficients between @xmath23 and the light curve . as a result ,",
    "a too small @xmath36 is discarded by this procedure .",
    "@xmath82 were calculated to be 23.74 , 17.41 , 9.71 , 6.86 , and 1.35 in the case of the artificial data ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) in the last subsection , respectively .",
    "thus , we conclude that the long - term trend estimated for data  ( e ) is a false result .",
    "second , we need to check whether an estimated long - term trend actually has a longer time - scale than short - term variations .",
    "as mentioned in subsection  2.1 , a long - term component is expected to depict a smooth path in the @xmath2 plane , and adopted the prior distribution with @xmath36 .",
    "in other words , the hyperparameter , @xmath36 , is related to the variation time - scale of the long - term trend in our model .",
    "a path of the long - term trend becomes more complicated and erratic in the case of a larger @xmath36 ( for example , see figure  [ fig : samplequ ] in subsection  3.2 ) . with an extremely large @xmath36 ,",
    "the variation amplitudes and time - scales of @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be comparable to those of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath36 should be restricted to be small enough to assure that the estimated @xmath83 and @xmath84 actually exhibit `` long''-term variations .",
    "we evaluate it using a travel distance in the @xmath2 plane of both long- and short - term components . the travel distance , @xmath87 ,",
    "is defined for a set of @xmath88 as follows : @xmath89 in this paper , the estimated @xmath83 and @xmath84 are acceptable in the case that the ratio of @xmath87 for long- and short - term components , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , satisfies the following condition : @xmath92 we call @xmath93 as the `` distance ratio '' . in conjunction with the first criterion about the correlation coefficient , we can restrict @xmath36 in a narrow range .",
    "results obtained by the bayesian model are quantitatively evaluated by the above criterion .",
    "it is , however , possible that a false long - term trend would be extracted from observations even the result satisfies the above criterion .",
    "hence , results from the bayesian model should be evaluated carefully .",
    "in addition to the above criterion , we can check the validity of results with their qualitative features .",
    "we expect that a long - term trend exhibits not a random walk , but a systematic motion in the @xmath2 plane",
    ". a long - term trend depicting a very complicated path in the @xmath2 plane may merely indicate that there is no systematic long - term trend in the observed @xmath2 .",
    "we should also suspect a result highly sensitive to a small change in @xmath36 .",

    "this is mainly because the prior distribution is not the real distribution for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "another form of the prior distribution may be more suitable for the case of polarization variations in blazars .",
    "the practical criterion defined in subsection  2.3 is enough for our exploratory model in this paper .",
    "( 160mm,160mm)samplequd.eps    our bayesian model can find a long - term trend in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "it can be also applied in the @xmath110 plane , while strong limitations are imposed for the application . in our two - component model , the observed @xmath111",
    "is described as : @xmath112 the two polarization components , namely , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , can be separated in the @xmath115 plane when @xmath116 and @xmath117 are much smaller than @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( e.g. @xcite ) . if the pd of the long - term trend is not negligible , the polarization components can not be separated without the estimation of @xmath120 and @xmath121 .    in the case",
    "that the pd of the long - term trend is large , the application of the bayesian model in the @xmath115 plane means the estimate of @xmath122 that lead to a positive correlation between the light curve and the modified pd calculated from @xmath123 .",
    "since @xmath120 is assumed to be time - independent in our model , the temporal behavior of the estimated @xmath124 is probably analogous to that of @xmath125 . in this sense ,",
    "the bayesian analysis in the @xmath115 plane is not completely nonsense , and can still provide meaningful results .",
    "a result in the @xmath115 plane would be noteworthy , particularly if the long - term trend in the @xmath115 plane draws an analogous path to that in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : samplequd ] is the same as figure  [ fig : samplequ ] , but for the @xmath115 plane .",
    "we found that the long - term trends estimated with @xmath126 are quite analogous to those in figure  [ fig : samplequ ] in the case of s2  0109@xmath0224 .",
    "the long - term trend in oj  287 also exhibits a common feature with that in the @xmath2 plane in terms of the oscillation of the polarization vector within a narrow range of pa .",
    "the similarity between the long - term trends in the @xmath2 and @xmath115 planes implies that the short - term flares were associated with the increases of pd in oj  287 and s2  0109@xmath0224 .",
    "the short - term flares may originate from a region where the direction of the magnetic field is more aligned than the whole emitting region .",
    "we showed that the polarization vector in oj  287 and s2  0109@xmath0224 can be separated into two components , the long - term trend and the short - term variation component .",
    "the result , however , provides no clear evidence for the existence of the two components in these objects .",
    "our bayesian model just gives us one of possible views for temporal variations of polarization in blazars .",
    "this view deserves to be discussed since simple and systematic variations can be extracted from apparently erratic variations . on the other hand ,",
    "further investigations are needed to confirm the two - component view .",
    "one of the most direct ways to obtain evidence for the two - component scenario would be vlbi radio observations .",
    "@xcite reported the presence of multiple polarization components even within radio cores in blazars .",
    "vsop-2 is a space vlbi project , which will resolve sub - pc regions around the central blackhole of agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "vsop-2 will reveal the detailed structure of the polarization components in the radio core .",
    "a part of the radio polarization components might exhibit temporal variations synchronized with the optical polarization components resolved by our bayesian model .",
    "if this is the case , our bayesian model , for the first time , provides a tool to investigate the temporal evolution of each polarization component observed both in the optical and radio regimes .",
    "our model assumes that the pf of the short - term component correlates with the light curve of the total flux ( condition `` ii ) '' in section  2.1 ) . in other words",
    ", we assumes the total flux exhibits a flare whenever a short - term polarization flare occurs .",
    "this assumption gives the condition that the application of our bayesian model is validated .",
    "our model definitely yields a false result if it applies to , for example , short - term polarization flares without significant variations of the total flux .",
    "if such variations are typical in a blazar , our model is not validated for it .",
    "our assumption should , hence , be evaluated case by case for objects . in our picture , a short - term flare with a larger amplitude is expected to show a better correlation with polarization because the specific polarization - feature of a smaller flare would be readily diluted by another small flares . hence , the polarization behavior of short and large flares would provide a key for the validation of our assumption .",
    "@xcite reported a rotation of the optical polarization vector in bl  lac and interpreted it as a shift of the emitting region through a helical magnetic field in the jet .",
    "such a rotation event can have been missed if the observed polarization has a long - term trend as considered in our model .",
    "our bayesian model would provide a tool to search the rotation events of the polarization vector both in the observed , long- and short - term components .",
    "no systematic rotation event can be seen in the long- and short - term components in the three objects , as shown in subsection  3.2 .",
    "we developed a bayesian model to extract a long - term trend from apparently erratic variations in polarization of blazars .",
    "our bayesian model successfully resolved the long- and short - term components in the artificial data .",
    "we applied this model to the photopolarimetric data of oj  287 , s5  0716@xmath0716 , and s2  0109@xmath0224 .",
    "simple and systematic long - term trends were obtained in oj  287 and s2  0109@xmath0224 , while no meaningful trend was identified in s5  0716@xmath0716 .",
    "we propose that all short - term flares were associated with the increase of the polarized flux in oj  287 and s2  0109@xmath0224 .",
    "the polarization variation in s5  0716@xmath0716 may be explained by a random variation caused by a number of polarization components having a quite short time - scale of variations .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with taichi kato and takuya yamashita .",
