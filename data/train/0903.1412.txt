    "it appears that the lowest cmb multipoles are anomalous in two seemingly distinct aspects .",
    "firstly , the angular power @xmath4 at the lowest @xmath2 is abnormally suppressed @xcite . secondly , they have an improbable directionality revealed by the fact that for a certain preferred orientation , one @xmath5-mode absorbs most of the power , which may imply the presence of an  axis of evil \" @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of perturbations carry the same symmetries as the background on which they are generated . in the standard scenario ,",
    "quantum fluctuations are assumed to be generated on a spatially homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "background spatial inhomogeneities are neglected in most of the analysis .",
    "indeed , a long period of inflation pulls all non - smooth classical initial conditions out of the horizon .",
    "however , if inflation lasts the minimal number 60 e - folds or so , perturbations with comoving wave - numbers of cosmological interest cross the horizon just during the earliest several e - folds of inflation .",
    "thus , the relic inhomogeneities may leave some marks in the primordial quantum fluctuations .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possible effects of a relic classical superhorizon inhomogeneity during inflation , especially its effects on the statistical properties of quantum fluctuations . in @xcite ,",
    "a single superhorizon perturbation mode were considered to explain the power asymmetry of cmb on large scales .",
    "while in this work , we consider relic superhorizon inhomogeneities as _",
    "background_. perturbation theory in the presence of a spatially inhomogeneous inflaton background value has been investigated by several authors before @xcite,@xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuations on this slightly inhomogeneous background are generally statistical anisotropic",
    ".    the deviations from statistical isotropy can take on many forms , which may correspond to different physical origins .",
    "one simple form was presented in @xcite,@xmath6 } $ ] . in this work",
    ", we find that the ( leading - order ) correction to the statistically isotropic power spectrum is of the acw form @xcite , but with a @xmath7-dependent factor @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the power spectrum deviates from isotropy mainly on large scales ( small @xmath7 ) , while remains highly isotropic on small scales .",
    "moreover , the spectrum itself is also suppressed on large scales .",
    "thus , our model can simultaneously explain the observed anisotropic alignments of the low-@xmath2 multipoles and their low power .",
    "in this work we investigate general single scalar field inflationary models , with an action of the form @xmath9}$ ] , where @xmath10 .",
    "now we consider a slightly inhomogeneous inflaton background @xmath11 .",
    "firstly , we assume the deviation from homogeneity is very small , i.e. , if @xmath12 is a spatial average of @xmath11 ( e.g. in one hubble volume ) , then we assume that @xmath13 secondly , we assume the inhomogeneities are superhorizon . in other words , the typical comoving scale of these background inhomogeneities",
    "@xmath14 is much larger than today s comoving hubble scale , @xmath15 .",
    "actually , it has been known long before that inflation can occur in the presence of superhorizon initial inhomogeneities @xcite . in other words , the inflaton field initially should be smooth up to physical scales larger than @xmath16 .",
    "thus , today s observational universe can indeed inflate from an initial small patch with classical inhomogeneities with typical comoving scale @xmath15 .",
    "superhorizon inhomogeneities locally look like a gradient , @xmath17 . in this work ,",
    "we neglect higher - order derivatives and treat @xmath18 as approximately constant ( while @xmath19 itself is indeed slow - rolling , for instance ) .",
    "we split @xmath20 into background and fluctuation configurations , @xmath21 in the following we denote @xmath22 , which we have assumed to be constant .    as a first - step investigation",
    ", we neglect the metric perturbations .",
    "thus the calculation is straight forward since all we have to do is to expand the action for the scalar field directly . according to ( [ decomposition ] ) , simple taylor expansion of @xmath23 around the background @xmath19 up to second order of @xmath24 gives @xmath25 where we have defined @xmath26 note that due to the non - vanishing background gradient @xmath27 , @xmath28 is not proportional @xmath29 any more .",
    "the presence of the additional term which is proportional @xmath30 in @xmath28 breaks spatial rotational invariance and will be responsible for the generation of statistical anisotropies of the scalar perturbations @xmath24 .    after introducing a new variable @xmath31 ,",
    "the second - order action for the scalar field perturbations can be written as @xmath32 \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is comoving time , and a prime represents @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is an effective mass term , @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 .",
    "here we define two dimensionless parameters @xmath39 in this paper , we assume @xmath40 .",
    "note that the canonical case corresponds to @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in deriving ( [ action ] )",
    ", we use the approximation that @xmath43 is a function of only @xmath33 , that is , we neglect the spatial dependence of @xmath43 .",
    "the classical equation of motion for the mode function according to the second - order action ( [ action ] ) is @xmath44 as it can be seen , an anisotropic dispersion relation arises , which will be responsible for the generation of a statistically anisotropic power spectrum .",
    "now we take the scale factor as @xmath45 .",
    "remarkably , in this simplest case , equation ( [ mode_eom ] ) has an analytic solution , @xmath46 in which @xmath47 is the confluent hypergeometric function , with @xmath48 due to the presence of the factor @xmath49 , the modes generally depend on @xmath50 rather than @xmath51 . here the coefficient in ( [ mode_solution ] ) is chosen in order to satisfy the wronskian normalization condition @xmath52 . in the limit @xmath53",
    ", it can be verified that ( [ mode_solution ] ) reduces to the well - known functional form @xmath54{a_i\\rightarrow 0 }      \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{2}{\\left ( \\nu+\\frac{1}{2 } \\right)}}\\sqrt{-\\eta }      h^{(1)}_{\\nu}(-ck\\eta ) \\",

    "this result has two implications .",
    "first , the deviation from statistical isotropy of the power spectrum is _ not _ constant on all scales ( while in @xcite and other works it is often assumed that @xmath90 is a constant @xmath91 ) .",
    "statistical anisotropy of @xmath4 spectrum mainly appears at the lowest @xmath2 s , while the spectrum at higher @xmath2 s remains highly isotropic ( this can be seen clearly from fig.[fig_1 ] , where for smaller @xmath7 , @xmath92 is highly anisotropic , while for larger @xmath7 , @xmath92 remains flat ) .",
    "second , for a given direction @xmath93 , since @xmath94 , the spectrum itself is suppressed at large scales ( see fig . [ fig_leading ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon explains the loss of power at the lowest @xmath2 s in the @xmath4 spectrum .",
    "( for a given direction of @xmath93 ) .",
    "the black dashed curve is the exact result , the red curve corresponds to the quadrupole term given in ( [ df_leading ] ) .",
    "here we have chosen that @xmath50 is parrallel to @xmath78 without loss of generality .",
    "parameters are chosen as @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "we plot @xmath7 from @xmath97 to 1.,width=264 ]    finally , the power spectrum of scalar perturbation on superhorizon scales reads , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is given in ( [ quadrupole ] ) . the general anisotropic power spectrum ( [ final_spectrum ] ) is function of @xmath7 and @xmath66 . in our model ,",
    "its _ shape _ is similar to that of @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "the observational data appear to suggest a spatial modulation in the cmb spectrum .",
    "especially , a vanishing cmb temperature auto - correlationi on the largest scales has been investigated by several authors @xcite . as mentioned before ,",
    "this can be naturally explained in our model , due to the suppression behavior of @xmath92 , @xmath94 , ( see fig . [ fig_leading ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_suppresion ] ) .    ) .",
    "the dashed line is traditional isotropic spectrum with @xmath100 . from top to bottem ,",
    "parameters are chosen as @xmath70 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "the range of @xmath7 is from @xmath104 to 1.,width=291 ]",
    "in this work , we studied cosmological perturbations in the presence of a superhorizon inhomogeneous inflaton background .",
    "we find that the leading - order correction to the standard isotropic power spectrum is a quadrupole anisotropy .",
    "moreover , the deviation from isotropy is generally scale - dependent .",
    "more specifically , the quadrupole correction term has a suppression factor @xmath8 . and",
    "thus our model can simultaneously explain the observed anisotropic alignment of the low-@xmath2 multipoles and their low power .",
    "if the indication of these large scale cmb anomalies were to be confirmed by future experiments , the work presented here would improve our understanding of inflation and the very early universe .    in our work ,",
    "the inhomogeneous background affects the perturbation through the non - linear structure of @xmath23 of @xmath105 .",
    "a similar effect would arise when one consider backreaction of superhorizon perturbations through the nonlinearity of the einstein equations @xcite .    in our approximations",
    ", we neglected the backreaction of the inhomogeneous inflaton background to the geometry , which has to be considered in a more rigorous analysis . in that case , a non - frw metric may arise .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , anisotropic inflatonary models and perturbations are investigated , where an anisotropic spectrum is also produced . in a frw background ,",
    "the quantization procedure is well undersood for canonical variables on sub - hubble scales , where they evolve adiabatically , and thus the adiabatic vacuum is well - defined . in this work ,",
    "we choose the mode solution ( [ mode_solution ] ) by simply noticing that ( [ mode_solution ] ) reduces to the standard mode solution in the @xmath106 limit",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the frequency term in the second - line of ( [ mode_eom ] ) is divergent when @xmath107 , due to the presence of the anisotropic term @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the presence of a wkb regime and also the quantization procedure in this case are non - trivial in general ( see e.g. discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to investigate these problems in future work .",
    "indeed , the work presented here is a general framework , while the results of our model are generic .",
    "a more detailed study including metric perturbations and possible non - frw background geometry is needed .",
    "we would like to present it in a companion work @xcite .",
