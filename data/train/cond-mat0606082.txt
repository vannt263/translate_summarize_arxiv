    "the single electron tunnelling devices made from quantum dots have been extensively studied not only for interesting physics such as kondo effect@xmath0 and coulomb blockade@xmath1 , but also for their promising applications in single - electron transistors ( sets)@xmath2 and single - photon generators ( spgs).@xmath3 spgs provide the antibunching single - photon sources ( spss ) for being applied in quantum communications . not only do spss crucial , but also single - photon detectors in the implementation of quantum communication systems .",
    "blakesley et al have demonstrated resonant diodes as efficient single - photon detectors@xmath4 . nevertheless , tunnelling current through the quantum wells are not sensitive enough to distinguish the intensity of sps in the ns period.@xmath4 to detect single - photon train in a short period , we proposal to employ sets to detect such a single - photon train .",
    "the studied set is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where a single quantum dot ( inas ) embedded in the gaas matrix connected with three terminals ( emitter , collector and base).we consider only the ground states of conduction and valence band of the qd , which are above the fermi energy levels of three electrodes @xmath5 .",
    "conventional sets are consisted of source , drain and gate electrodes , where the gate electrode is used to tune the energy levels of qds , but not supplies carriers . in contrast , the base terminal will provide holes into the qd in this study . in the absence of holes ,",
    "the applied voltage crossing the emitter and collector is insufficient to yield significant current .",
    "once holes residing at the qd creating new channels for electrons tunnelling from emitter to collector , the remarkable collector current ( @xmath6)is yielded .",
    "in addition , the base current ( @xmath7 ) arises from the photon emission via electron - hole recombination of the exciton complex state will be observed .    unlike traditional transistors ( electric output ) and light emitting diodes ( optical output ) , the light - emitting single - electron transistors ( lesets ) with electric and optical outputs can readily reach high current gain ( @xmath8 ) ( only voltage gain in conventional sets ) .",
    "it is expected that @xmath9 is a manifested demonstration of small signal amplifier .",
    "therefore , it could be applied to detect single - photon train . for a small semiconductor qd",
    ", particle collection significantly influences the transport and optical properties of single electron tunnelling devices . within the framework of the effective mass model@xmath10 , fig .",
    "2 show the electron - electron interaction @xmath11 , hole - hole interaction @xmath12 and electron - hole interaction @xmath13 for different exciton complex configurations .",
    "the electron - hole coulomb energy @xmath13 in the exciton @xmath14 is almost the same as that in @xmath15 and is omitted in this plot .",
    "note that the magnitude of charging energies ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) for electrons or holes in the same order of thermal energy of room temperature @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a boltzmann constant .",
    "this indicates that the operation temperature of system should be much lower than room temperature .",
    "owing to the applied bias crossing the qd , the electric field effect is not negligible in the variation of particle interactions .",
    "we adopt the size of qd with radius 7.5 nm and height 3 nm to study the electric field effect on the particle coulomb interactions .",
    "we assume that the z axis is directed from the base to the apex of the dot .",
    "3 shows the coulomb interaction strengths as functions of electric field for different exciton complexes .",
    "we see that @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath16 display asymmetric behavior of electric field as a result of geometer of the dots .",
    "increasing electric field , the deduction of @xmath13 indicates that the electron - hole separation increases .",
    "however , we note that @xmath17 increases in the positive direction of electric field since the wave functions of holes become more localize . even though the enhancement of @xmath16 is observed in the negative direction of electric field , it only exists at very small electric field region .",
    "when the electric field is larger than a threshold value , the wave functions of electrons become delocalize and leak out the quantum dot . consequently , electron - electron coulomb interactions becomes weak .",
    "as mentioned , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the charging energies of qd for electrons and holes , respectively .",
    "therefore , the constant interaction model used in the anderson model is valid only for small electric field case , otherwise we should take into account bias - dependent coulomb interactions",
    "an anderson model with two energy levels and constant interactions is used to describe the system as shown in fig . 1 ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 create ( destroy ) an electron of momentum @xmath24 in the emitter , collector and base electrodes , respectively .",
    "the free electron model is considered in the electrodes in which electrons have frequency - dependent energies @xmath25 and @xmath26+v(t ) .",
    "time - dependent modulation v(t ) denotes the time - dependent applied voltage in the base electrode .",
    "@xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron inside the qd with orbital energy @xmath29 . in this study",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 represent , respectively , the ground states of valence band and conduction band of individual qds .",
    "the fifth term describes the coupling of the qd with electromagnetic field of frequency @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the rabi frequency , where @xmath34 is the matrix element for the optical transition and @xmath35 is the electric field per photon .",
    "@xmath36 describes the coupling between the band states of electrodes and energy levels of qd .",
    "note that a unitary transformation , @xmath37 , has been used to obtain eq .",
    "( 1 ) via @xmath38    to investigate the exciton assistant process , the interlevel coulomb interaction @xmath39 ( @xmath13 ) is taken into account in eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath40 which is invariant under unitary transformation . because we restrict in the regime of applied voltage not sufficient to overcome the charging energies resulting from @xmath41 and @xmath42 , therefore",
    ", we ignore @xmath41 and @xmath42 terms in this study.@xmath2    the emitter current can be calculated using the nonequilibrium keldysh green s functions , which can be found in refs.[7,8 ] .",
    "wang et al have pointed out that the displacement current arising from ac applied voltage is crucial to maintain gauge invariance , which will be satisfied when the condition of total charge conservation is satisfied.@xmath43 the time - dependent emitter current is consisted of the collector current and base current @xmath44.the collector current satisfying the charge conservation and gauge invariance is given by @xmath45\\\\ \\nonumber & \\times & [ -ima^r_e(\\epsilon , t)-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d|a^r_e(\\epsilon , t)|^2}{dt}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 denotes the retarded ( advanced ) green s function of electrons . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) we assume that tunnelling rates @xmath48 are energy - and bias independent . to solve the spectral function of electrons @xmath49 , the retarded green s function of electrons @xmath50 is derived to obtain @xmath51 with @xmath52 two branches exist in eq .",
    "( 4 ) ; one corresponds to the electron resonant energy level of @xmath53 with a weight of @xmath54 , and the other corresponds to the exciton resonant level of @xmath55 with a weight of @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , electrons injected into the energy levels of qds depends on not only the emitter and collect voltages , but also on the hole occupation number @xmath57 , which is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "the retarded green s function of holes is given by    @xmath60    where the time - dependent applied voltage v(t ) denotes a rectangular pulse with duration time @xmath61 and amplitude @xmath62.the time translation symmetry of @xmath63 is destroyed by v(t ) ( note that it is a typical n - i - n set case ) .",
    "comparing to @xmath63 , the time translation symmetry of @xmath64 is destroyed by hole occupation number .",
    "therefore , it is expected that @xmath65 will be very different from the tunnelling current of typical n - i - n sets.@xmath66 the expression of base current arising from the electron - hole recombination of exciton state is given by @xmath67 where@xmath68 , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the refractive index and static dielectric constant of system , respectively .",
    "we see that @xmath72 is determined by the time - dependent interband joint density of states and the factors of @xmath73 . to simplify the calculation of eq .",
    "( 8) , we approximate it as @xmath74 where @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "although tunnelling currents are more interesting than electron and hole occupation numbers from the experimental viewpoint , we still numerically solve eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 10 ) and show the occupation number of electrons and holes as a function of time for different amplitudes of applied rectangular pulse voltage with @xmath77at zero temperature in fig .",
    "4 ; the solid and dashed lines denote , respectively , the amplitude @xmath78 mv and @xmath79 mv .",
    "when holes are injected into the qd , the exciton resonant energy level for electrons is yielded .",
    "consequently , the emitter supplies electrons into the qd via the exciton resonant energy level .",
    "in particular , some interesting oscillations superimpose on the charing and discharging processes of holes .",
    "such a oscillatory behavior can not be observed for electron tunnelling process .",
    "in addition , @xmath80 exhibits a retarded response with respect to time . for @xmath81",
    ", @xmath82 is still less than 0.2 although @xmath83 already reaches 0.8 .",
    "this is because @xmath82 is in proportion to @xmath84 and the electron - channel behaviors as an opened system since @xmath85  mev . on the other hand the hole channel behaviors as a closed system since @xmath86 .",
    "once electrons are injected into the qds , the collector current and base current occur .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) show the base current and collector current , respectively .",
    "when electrons tunnel into the qd from the emitter , photons are emitted from electron - hole recombination of exciton state , such photons should exhibit the antibounching feature with respect to time .",
    "although in ref.[13 ] the antibuching feature of photons was reported , electrons and holes are injected into a single layer with dilute density of qds .",
    "therefore , in ref.[13 ] the tunnelling current arising from the spontaneous radiation of interband transition should be included the particle size distribution.@xmath87 it is worth noting that the photon number correlation function used to examine the antibunching characteristics are relevant with the base current behavior .",
    "comparing to the base current , the exponential growth and decay of collector current are not so faster as that of base current",
    ". however , the collector current still mimics the behavior of base current . due to the collector current in the units of @xmath88 , the current gain defined as @xmath89",
    "can readily reach 100 for @xmath90mev .",
    "consequently , the response of small signal can be amplified through the output of collector electrode .",
    "as mentioned , lesets can be used as efficient sps detectors .    finally , figs .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) show the base current and collector current for two different tunnelling rates of hole .",
    "other parameters used are the same as those employed in figs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . due to smaller tunnelling rate for solid line ,",
    "hole occupation number is smaller in solid line than that of dashed line before pulse turns off .",
    "subsequently , the electron occupation number also becomes smaller for @xmath91 mev .",
    "consequently , the base current is suppressed for @xmath92 . however , the discharging time is enhanced for electrons and holes as @xmath91 mev , the base current at @xmath93 is larger at @xmath91 mev than @xmath94 mev .",
    "the physical picture of collector current can be understood through the interpretation of the base current .",
    "the results shown in figs . 5 and 6 indicate that the shape of collector current can be tuned by the combination of tunnelling rate and duration time of applied signal .",
    "this could be used to manipulate the shape of time - dependent current .",
    "we have studied the dynamic properties of lesets made from a single qd embedded in a matrix connected with the emitter , collector and base electrodes .",
    "electrons are transport carriers in the conduction band electrodes . as for valence",
    "band base electrode , holes created by light excition or carrier doping play a role of switch trigger for the base current and collector current .",
    "the high current gain @xmath89 can be readily reached using semiconductor engineering fabrication technique .",
