    "rogue waves ( rws ) appear in variety of physical systems , such as in oceans @xcite , in atmosphere @xcite , in optics @xcite , in plasma @xcite .",
    "a fundamental property of such extreme waves is that they appear from nowhere , reach heights up to twice the height of surrounding waves , and disappear without a trace @xcite .",
    "significant theoretical progress has been achieved in recent years in order to describe the formation of rws within the framework in weakly nonlinear evolution equations @xcite .",
    "in fact , rws may be modeled in a general context by exact breather solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xcite , which describe the propagation of stationary and pulsating wave packet dynamics in nonlinear dispersive media .",
    "an appropriate model to describe strong localizations in the medium of interest is the family of doubly - localized breather solutions , also referred to as akhmediev - peregrine ( ap ) solutions .",
    "the first - order solution is known as the peregrine breather ( pb ) solution @xcite ; it is localized in space and in time , since it is the limiting case of time - periodic kuznetsov - ma solitons @xcite as well as space - periodic akhmediev breathers @xcite , when the period of these periodic solutions tends to infinity .",
    "furthermore , the ap amplifies the amplitudes of the carrier by a factor of three and higher .",
    "pb dynamics has been validated experimentally in optics @xcite , in water waves @xcite and in plasma @xcite .",
    "more recently higher - order breathers have been observed as well @xcite .",
    "there are indeed several interesting rw pattern solutions which the nls may admit .",
    "fundamental patterns may consist of a simple central high peak , surrounded by several gradually decreasing solitonic peaks , an equal height triangular pattern , or a circular pattern @xcite .",
    "doubly - localized ap solutions are symmetric with respect to both the spatial and the temporal co - ordinate in theory",
    ". however , several non - symmetrical rogue waves under fundamental pattern have been observed in water tank , see for instance figs .",
    "4 - 6 in @xcite , figs . 3 , 4 and 6 in @xcite ,",
    "figs . 3 - 9 in @xcite .",
    "the observed non - symmetry of wave profiles in the wave flume is due to higher - dispersive and to the effect of the mean flow , not captured in the nls , which can be explained by more accurate evolution equation , such as the generalized nls in optics and the modified nls ( mnls ) in water waves @xcite .    independently from these higher - order effects , it is an interesting task to derive doubly - localized and non - symmetric solutions of the nls .",
    "physically , non - symmetric structures have different and fundamental distribution of energy and would be of interest for several physical applications . in this work ,",
    "we derive exact solutions of the manakov system up to third - order and as a special class corresponding family of non - symmetric doubly localized solutions of the nls .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate the physical accuracy of the derived solutions to describe strong localizations in water waves by generating experimentally the derived second - order solution in a water wave tank .",
    "it is shown that the expected amplitude amplification of the background is reached .",
    "moreover , the experimental results are in very good agreement with numerical mnls simulations .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the lax pair of the manakov system and solve the lax pair equations , with spectral parameter @xmath0 , from a periodic _ seed _ solution .",
    "in other words , we derive eigenfunctions of the manakov system , associated with the spectral parameter @xmath0 . in section 3",
    ", we give a determinant representation of the @xmath1th - order vector rws of the manakov system . in particular , exact expressions for the first- , second- and third - order rw solutions of the nls equation , localized in both time and space are reported .",
    "the latter solutions have the property to be non - symmetric with respect to the spatial co - ordinate .",
    "furthermore , the differences between the non - symmetric and corresponding symmetric doubly - localized rws of the nls equation are discussed in detail . in section 4 , we shall compare experimental data , related to the evolution of the non - symmetric solution , derived in this work , in a water wave tank , with nls maximal wave profile predictions as well as with numerical mnls simulations .",
    "finally , we summarize the main results in section 5 .",
    "recently , rw solutions of the multi - component soliton equations have been derived .",
    "these solutions attracted the scientific interest @xcite .",
    "the manakov system @xcite is an important integrable two - component nls system and can be applied to optical as well as hydrodynamic systems @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath2 is a solution of the manakov system @xmath3 then @xmath4 is a solution of the nls equation @xmath5 in the present paper , we shall construct the solutions of the manakov system under the condition @xmath6 by the darboux transformation ( dt ) from a periodic _ seed _ solution , which imply several non - symmetrical extreme localizations of the nls equation .",
    "the dt is a powerful method to generate soliton @xcite , breather @xcite , rw @xcite solutions of the nls equation .",
    "the breather solution of the manakov system @xcite has been constructed by the dt from a periodic _ seed _ solution .",
    "a crucial step of the dt method is to find the solutions , i.e. eigenfunctions of the linear partial differential equations , defined by the lax pair of the soliton equations .",
    "therefore , we shall first solve the eigenfunctions of the manakov system in this section in order to provide necessary preparatory work for the dt in next section .",
    "the manakov system is produced by the compatibility of the associated lax pair equations : @xmath7 where @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is a vector eigenfunction associated with the spectral parameter @xmath0 .",
    "+ to obtain rw solutions of the manakov system , we start with periodic _ seed _ solutions , @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",

    "<S> the derived non - symmetric doubly - localized second - order solution is generated experimentally in a water wave flume for deep - water conditions . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results , confirming the characteristic non - symmetric pattern of the solution , are in very good agreement with theory as well as with numerical simulations , based on the modified nonlinear schrdinger equation , known to model accurately the dynamics of weakly nonlinear wave packets in deep - water </S>",
