    "a widely used technique to search for large - scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of crs is the analysis in right ascension ( ra ) , using harmonic analysis or another convenient method .",
    "the major difficulty in this approach consists of the evaluation of the directional exposure of the experiment , which is distorted by instrumental errors and weather conditions . in the case of the yakutsk array data , only at energies above @xmath1",
    "eev = @xmath0 ev do these effects appear marginal compared to the statistical errors in the estimation of extensive air shower ( eas ) parameters rising with energy .",
    "accordingly , we divide our target energy range into 2 parts : below and above @xmath2 eev , where different methods of analysis are applicable . in practice ,",
    "measurement below @xmath3 is complicated by the need to correct the counting rate for instrumental and atmospheric effects , which must be done to prevent the introduction of artificial variations in the cr flux .",
    "for example , the east - west method , being based on a differential technique , was designed to avoid introducing such corrections , preventing the possible associated systematics to affect the results .",
    "the original idea@xcite was proposed to be applied in the analysis of the data from the mt .",
    "norikura array .",
    "the method was analyzed in detail by bonino et al.@xcite using simulations reproducing realistic conditions of a ground experiment subject to artificial modulations at both the diurnal and the seasonal time scales .",
    "they explain the principle of the east - west method as : `` ... aimed at reconstructing the equatorial component of a genuine large scale pattern by using only the difference of the counting rates of the eastern and western hemispheres .",
    "the effects of experimental origin , being independent of the incoming direction , are expected to be removed through the subtraction '' .    in this paper ,",
    "another approach is used , named the south - north method ( snm ) , which is based on comparison of the data samples in independent right ascension circles .",
    "the principle of the method and results of the analysis as applied to the yakutsk array data are given in section 2 .",
    "above @xmath3 the array exposure can be assumed uniform in ra , and a version of harmonic analysis adapted to test for uniformity of the distribution focusing on the first harmonic phase is used here .",
    "the method is described in section 3 .",
    "a subset of the yakutsk array data consisting of 590887 eas events in the energy range @xmath4 eev with zenith angles @xmath5 detected within the array area during the observation period 19742000 is used in the analysis . the rest of the data detected after 2000 will be analyzed later .",
    "earth s rotation gives the possibility for the surface arrays to scan celestial sphere mapping as the right ascension distribution of cr arrival directions .",
    "scintillation counters of the yakutsk array have a 24-hour duty cycle resulting in an almost uniform directional exposure.@xcite however , at energies below @xmath0 ev , there are deviations from the uniformity , which are caused by detector malfunctions and variations of the atmospheric conditions .",
    "estimation of the diurnal and seasonal variations of the yakutsk array exposure have been given previously.@xcite    in this paper , however , estimations of the array exposure and corrections are not used . instead , the ra distribution of crs within the declination interval is tested for uniformity .",
    "the main assumption is that there is only one separable source of crs vs isotropic background in the data observed , if any ; and it is restricted in angular size . dividing a bulk of the data into samples within declination bins , say , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , one can compare ra distributions using the @xmath9-test with statistic @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are observed and expected frequencies in @xmath12 intervals .",
    "a choice of the particular goodness - of - fit test is based on the result of comparative analysis@xcite of the statistical power of the most popular tests in the case of simple hypotheses @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a known parameter .",
    "it was shown that the pearson @xmath9 test with asymptotically optimal grouping is the most powerful test in comparison to anderson - darling @xmath15 , mises @xmath16 , and kolmogorov - smirnov tests .",
    "a distinctive feature of the method is the same instrumental and weather non - uniformities of the distributions observed in different declination bins .",
    ", needed to reject a null hypothesis if there is a separable source of crs giving a fraction , @xmath17 , of the total flux . ]    if there is no significant deviation of the samples from each other , one can conclude that : i ) the distributions are uniform ( taking into account the array exposure ) ; or ii ) the same source is lurking in both samples .",
    "the restricted angular size of the source excludes the second alternative , especially in the case of 3 or more samples .",
    "the statistical power of the method is its efficiency depending on the sample size @xmath18 .",
    "a lower limit of @xmath18 must be found , needed to reject the isotropic hypothesis , @xmath19 , at a confidence level of 99% when an alternative hypothesis , @xmath20 , is true . to estimate @xmath21 , @xmath20",
    "was used consisting of a separate cr source as a @xmath22-function located in @xmath23 , yielding the fraction @xmath17 of the total cr flux , and all other sources forming an isotropic background that provide @xmath24 of the flux .",
    "the second sample consists of the isotropic crs .",
    "a monte carlo algorithm is used to model @xmath19 and @xmath20 with the sample sizes provided by the yakutsk array data .",
    "the result of the snm simulation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] compared to the rayleigh test.@xcite the former method appears to be somewhat more powerful than the latter .",
    "a sample of @xmath25 eas events is needed in both cases , for example , to reject the null hypothesis if there is a point source providing @xmath26 of cr flux .",
    "right ascension distributions of cr arrival directions are sampled in energy , @xmath27 , and declination bins , @xmath28 .",
    "the energy range suitable for the south - north method is @xmath29 ev in the case of the yakutsk array data .",
    "the resultant samples of data are bounded into 4 energy and 3 declination bins .",
    "the ra interval is divided into @xmath30 equidistant bins .    in a given energy interval ,",
    "3 samples of ra distribution ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) are compared in pairs using pearson s @xmath9 goodness - of - fit test with 8 degrees of freedom .    in table 1",

    "@xmath35% 2 samples are significantly different .",
    "all pairs exhibit the probabilities above this limit .",
    "one can conclude that 3 samples : @xmath36 in declination bins are compatible , so there is no separable source of crs with the angular size below @xmath37 in the 4 energy intervals considered .",
    "upper limits of the fraction of crs from the source under the @xmath20 hypothesis have been derived , using the statistical power of snm applied to the pair of data samples detected with the yakutsk array in declination bins .",
    "the monte carlo code comprises a point source in the case of @xmath20 , however , for the number of equidistant intervals @xmath30 used here to calculate the @xmath9-statistic , it is equivalent to the source of the width @xmath38 .    for a given number of events , @xmath18 , there is a limited fraction of crs from a separable source , indistinguishable to the statistical test",

    "harmonic analysis in ra of cr arrival directions detected with the yakutsk array before 2000 had found no statistically significant deviation from an isotropic distribution.@xcite however , the telescope array collaboration reported@xcite on a cluster of events , a ` hotspot ' , found above 57  eev in the northern sky at a significance level of 5.1@xmath41 .    additionally , the first harmonic phase exhibits a non - uniform behavior : a gradual increase with energy in ra.@xcite this finding is potentially interesting , because with a real underlying anisotropy , a consistency of the phase measurements in ordered energy intervals is indeed expected to be revealed with a smaller number of events than that needed to detect the amplitude with a high statistical significance .    while the most convenient way of testing for the uniformity of arrival directions seems to be an analysis of the minimal width of the distribution@xcite , here another approach is followed , motivated by the findings mentioned above , aimed at the phase behavior , namely , analysis of the first harmonic phases ; in other words , double harmonic analysis of the ra distribution .    the phase of the first harmonic points to the excess flux of crs in ra distribution , if there is a source , or is uniformly distributed otherwise .",
