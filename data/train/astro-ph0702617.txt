    "x - ray flares have been detected during the early afterglows in a significant fraction of gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the amplitude of the x - ray flare can be a factor of up to @xmath0 for grb050502b @xcite , and in most cases a factor several , compared with the background afterglow component .",
    "the rapid rise and decay behavior of some flares suggests that they are caused by internal dissipation of energy due to late central engine activity .",
    "therefore the inner flare photons , when they are passing through the forward shocks , must interact with the shocked electrons and get boosted to higher energies @xcite .",
    "see fig.1 for a cartoon illustration .",
    "the observed overlapping in time between flares and afterglows indicates that these two kind of particles ( i.e. photons and shocked electrons ) have indeed interacted with each other around the overlap time@xcite .",
    "this process is expected to occur whether the x - ray flares are produced by internal shocks or by other internal energy dissipation mechanisms , as long as they occur inside the inner edge of the forward shock region .",
    "let us now estimate the flux of this ic component .",
    "we consider an x - ray flare of duration @xmath1 superimposed upon an underlying power law x - ray afterglow around time @xmath2 after the burst , as observed in grb050502b .",
    "we find that the energy density of flare photons in the comoving frame of the forward shock is larger than the magnetic energy density ( @xmath3 ) when @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the equipartition factor for magnetic field in forward shocks .",
    "since the flux of the x - ray flare is also much larger than that of the underlying x - ray afterglow which may represent the synchrotron luminosity , we conclude that generally the cooling of forward shock electrons is dominated by scattering the x - ray flare photons .",
    "it is also shown that when the x - ray flare flux is larger than a critical flux @xmath6 , we have @xmath7 , and all the newly shocked electrons will cool , emitting most of their energy into the ic emission@xcite .",
    "this critical flux is usually much lower than the x - ray flare flux averaged over its duration , so we conclude that the flare photons can effectively cool the electrons in the forward shock and most energy of the newly shock electrons will be lost into ic emission .",
    "so the total ic energy is @xmath8 and the averaged ic flux is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the peak time of the flare @xcite .",
    "the observed ic @xmath12 flux peaks at @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the peak of the flare energy spectrum .",
    "the ic emission occurs right inside the glast window and has a total fluence about @xmath15@xmath16 for @xmath17 , so it should be detected by glast . for the strongest bursts with @xmath18 , the gev photons",
    "could even have been detected by egret , such as from grb940217 @xcite .",
    "agile may also be able to detect this high energy component from strong bursts .    if described approximately as broken power law , the ic energy spectrum(@xmath19 ) has indices of @xmath20 and @xmath21 before and after the break at @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the @xmath21 power law spectrum can extend to a maximum energy @xmath23 , above which the ic falls into the klein - nishina regime . requiring the ic scattering to be in the thomson regime,@xmath24 , gives @xmath25 .",
    "the optical depth due to @xmath26 absorption on the x - ray flare photons for the maximum energy @xmath23 is @xmath27 . due to the low absorption depth and the flat spectral slope above @xmath23",
    ", tev photons associated with bright x - ray flares are expected to be detectable with detectors such as magic , milagro , h.e.s.s . ,",
    "veritas and argo etc .",
    "the incoming x - ray flare photons , which moves out in radial direction , are anisotropic seen by the isotropically distributed electrons in the forward shock , so more head - on scatterings may decrease the ic emission in the @xmath28 cone along the direction of the photon beam ( corresponding to the angle less than @xmath29 relative to the photon beam direction in the comoving frame ) @xcite , but enhance the emission at larger angles , with about a fraction of @xmath30 of total emission falling into the angles between @xmath28 and @xmath31 @xcite . in the comoving frame of the forward shock ,",
    "the ic emission power depends on the relative angle @xmath32 between the scattered photon direction and the seed photon beam direction as @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath34 results in more power emitted at large angles relative to the seed photon beam direction . by simple algebraical calculation ,",
    "one can obtain the fraction of photons scattered into the angles @xmath35 in the shock comoving frame ( corresponding to the @xmath28 cone of the relativistic afterglow jet in the observer frame due to aberration of light ) , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , one can get that the fraction of photons falling into the cone of @xmath31 ( corresponding to @xmath37 ) is @xmath20 .",
    "so the effect of anisotropic scattering can decrease the ic emission in the @xmath28 cone along the direction of the photon beam , but enhance the emission at larger angles .",
    "however if the opening angle is @xmath38 , the jet geometry can be approximately regarded as a sphere , and the observed ic power after integration over angles should be the same in every direction in the observer frame @xcite .",
    "supposing that the flare photons and forward shock ejecta have a @xmath39 solid angle ( i.e. not jet ) , then the ic emission in the observer frame should have the same flux in every direction with a flux level as estimated in the above section .",
    "hence the received ic component fluence is not reduced .",
    "the anisotropic scattering effect does affect the temporal behavior of the ic emission .",
    "ic emission will be lengthened by the forward shock angular spreading time , which is also influenced by the anisotropic ic effect , so the ic component would not be correlated strictly with the flare light curves . since a large fraction of the ic emission is falling within angles @xmath40 between @xmath28 to @xmath31 , the ic component will peak at @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the flare peak time .",
    "the ic component light curves is shown as the thick solid line in fig.2 .",
    "the self - ic of x - ray flares may also produce a high - energy component , but its light curve should be correlated with the x - ray flare itself to some extent @xcite , as shown in the thin solid line .",
    "glast might be able to distinguish these two different processes in future with the temporal behavior of the very high - energy emission and therefore provides a useful approach for distinguishing whether x - ray flares originate from late central engine activity or from external shocks .",
    "the enhanced cooling of the forward shock electrons by the x - ray flare photons may suppress the synchrotron emission of the afterglows during the flare period@xcite .",
    "due to more head - on scatterings with electrons moving in angles larger than @xmath29 relative to the photon beam direction in the comoving frame and less scatterings with electrons within @xmath29 , the anisotropic scattering effect may weaken the cooling effect of flare photons on the afterglow electrons ( which are moving within @xmath29 in the comoving frame and moving within @xmath28 in the observer frame correspondingly ) , hence reduce the extent to which the flare photons affect the afterglow flux intensity . to suppress the synchrotron afterglow emission significantly ,",
    "the cooling induced by the flare photons should be higher than that by the magnetic field . as a result",
    ", only bright flares are expected to significantly suppress the optical afterglow flux during the flare period , such as seen in grb050904 @xcite .",
