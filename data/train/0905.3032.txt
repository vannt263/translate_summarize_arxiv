    "models with warped extra dimensions  @xcite offer a rich new avenue towards our understanding of the stability of the electroweak ( ew ) scale against ultraviolet physics .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite applied to models compactified on a slice of ads@xmath2  @xcite , resulted in an ads@xmath2/cft dictionary relating the 5d models to their dual 4d strongly coupled field theories .",
    "the intensive effort put into the study of models with warped extra dimensions has resulted in a number of realistic models of natural electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) based on them  @xcite .",
    "custodial symmetry  @xcite and a custodial protection of the @xmath3 coupling  @xcite have proven essential to get realistic models with light enough new particles to make them accessible at the lhc .",
    "surprisingly , the immense majority of the models follow the original in the choice of background , ads@xmath2 , and the way the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken , by suddenly ending the extra dimension in what is called the infrared ( ir ) brane .",
    "this hard wall realization of the spontaneous breaking of the conformal invariance corresponds , in the dual 4d picture to a breaking by an operator of infinite scaling dimension .",
    "instead , one could replace the ir brane with a soft wall so that the extra dimension expands to infinity but there is a departure from conformality in the ir either by a modification of the metric or by the introduction of a dilaton .",
    "this corresponds in the dual picture to conformal breaking by an operator of finite dimension .",
    "soft wall models were introduced in  @xcite to model the observed regge trajectories in hadronic resonances through five - dimensional duals ( hard wall models in ads@xmath2 give a mass scaling @xmath4 instead of the observed @xmath5 ) . very recently",
    ", soft wall realizations of models of ewsb were presented in  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of new resonances is affected by the soft wall , with behaviors that range from a ( modified ) discrete spectrum to a continuous spectrum with or without a mass gap .",
    "this provides new realizations of hidden - valley like models  @xcite and unparticle physics  @xcite ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "an analysis of the bosonic sector of these models shows that the constraints on the masses of new particles from the @xmath6 parameter alone can be relaxed with respect to hard wall models and new bosonic resonances as light as @xmath7 tev , or even lighter , are compatible with current limits on the @xmath6 parameter  @xcite .",
    "earlier attempts  @xcite used a smooth deviation from ads in the ir given by a power law , instead of the exponential form we will use , and considered the higgs to be localized at a fixed position in the bulk ( on a non - gravitating brane ) .",
    "the result was that the bound on the mass of the lightest kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes did not appreciably change with respect to the case of a hard wall in the family of parameterizations used .",
    "the fermionic sector , however , was not studied in detail in either of these works and was not included in the analysis of the ew constraints .",
    "this is fine in general for the lighter fermions , which can to a good approximation be considered as fields living in the uv brane .",
    "the large mass of the top quark , however , does not allow us to neglect the fact that third generation quarks have to propagate in the bulk .",
    "this results , in hard wall models , in an important effect of the top sector in ew precision tests through their contribution mainly to the @xmath8 parameter and the @xmath3 coupling at the loop level .",
    "the aim of this work is to systematically study bulk fermions in soft wall models .",
    "this allows us to discuss the impact of the top sector on ew observables and therefore obtain reliable bounds on the mass of the new resonances . also ,",
    "although considering light fermions as bulk fields is irrelevant regarding ew observables , it is not regarding the flavor structure of the model .",
    "out formalism provides the tools to analyze the flavor constraints in soft wall models .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ fermions ]",
    "we consider bulk fermions in warped extra dimensions with a soft wall .",
    "we develop tools that allow us to study the implications of bulk fermions , from the light generations to the top quark , in ew precision tests and flavor physics . in section  [ ew",
    ": constraints ] we use these tools to analyze the ew constraints in custodial models with a soft wall , including for the first time the effect of the top sector in such models .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] is devoted to a discussion of our results , including the distinctive collider implications of soft wall models , and to our conclusions .",
    "we have included in appendices  [ background ] and  [ bosons ] technical details on the background and the expansion of bosonic fields for completeness .",
    "a soft wall can be implemented in models with warped extra dimensions either through the position dependent vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a dilaton field or by a modification of the metric in the ir .",
    "we choose the former approach and work in an ads@xmath2 background , @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the coordinate along the extra dimension and @xmath13 is the inverse ads@xmath2 curvature scale .",
    "the end - point at @xmath14 is commonly denoted as the ultraviolet ( uv ) brane .",
    "the soft wall is generated by the @xmath15-dependent vev of a dilaton field @xmath16 .",
    "the matter action reads @xmath17 the spectrum of bosonic fields is sensitive to the dilaton profile .",
    "in particular , depending on its behavior at large @xmath15 , it can lead to a discrete or continuous spectrum ( with or without a mass gap ) . in the case of a discrete spectrum",
    ", the inter - mode spacing also depends on the dilaton profile . in this article",
    "we will focus on a quadratic dilaton profile @xmath18 which gives rise to a discrete spectrum with masses scaling as @xmath19 as opposed to the usual @xmath4 found in hard wall models . note that @xmath20 here is not the position of any brane but the scale at which the effect of the dilaton becomes sizable and the solution departs from standard ads .",
    "still , @xmath21 determines the mass gap and if we want our soft wall model to solve the hierarchy problem , we should have @xmath22 tev .",
    "this background can be obtained dynamically as a solution to einstein equations in the presence of an extra bulk tachyonic scalar , as was shown in  @xcite . the solution for bulk bosonic fields",
    "were analyzed in detail in that reference and we just collect the relevant results in the appendices .",
    "bulk fermions were also discussed in  @xcite but they are somewhat problematic in soft wall models and not many details could be investigated .",
    "the main result of this article is to develop the tools needed to analyze in great generality the phenomenological implications of bulk fermions in soft wall models .",
    "consider a five - dimensional fermion , @xmath23 , in our soft wall background .",
    "its action reads @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 run over five dimensions in the curved and the tangent spaces respectively , @xmath26 is the fnfbein , @xmath27 is the gravitationally covariant derivative , @xmath28 are the dirac matrices in 5 dimensions and @xmath29 is a bulk dirac mass that is left unspecified for the moment . after integration by parts",
    "the action can be written as @xmath30 \\psi   = \\int d^5x \\ , \\bar{\\psi } \\big [ i \\cancel{\\partial } + \\partial_5 \\gamma^5 - a m \\big ] \\psi ,   \\label{bulk : fermion : action}\\ ] ] where in the second equation we have defined @xmath31 the action written in terms of the field @xmath32 shows the main problem .",
    "the dilaton and the metric have disappeared from the action , except for the factor of the metric multiplying the dirac mass .",
    "this latter term is actually very important . in the absence of a bulk mass , even in hard wall models",
    ", fermions would know nothing about the background and their kk expansion would be in terms of trigonometric instead of bessel functions .",
    "a constant bulk dirac mass allows the fermions to have a kk expansion more according to the ads@xmath2 background and for a particular value @xmath33 they behave exactly the same as bulk gauge bosons in the same background .",
    "unfortunately this is not enough in soft wall models .",
    "if we assume the standard choice of a constant bulk dirac mass , then the corresponding zero mode , when allowed by the boundary conditions , does not go to zero rapidly enough at large @xmath15 .",
    "even when it is normalizable , it will invariably have strong coupling with some gauge boson kk modes .",
    "the situation would not improve if we modeled the soft wall with a modified metric instead of a dilaton . in that case",
    ", the modification of the metric goes in the direction of making it go to zero faster than @xmath34 ( for instance exponentially ) at large @xmath15 .",
    "the effect of the bulk mass is then even less important and the zero mode is simply not normalizable .",
    "the authors of  @xcite noted that , if the higgs has a @xmath15-dependent profile that grows towards the ir , as would be expected in a model that solves the hierarchy problem , its yukawa coupling to fermions induces a bulk mass term that shields the fermions from the deep ir and can thus solve this problem .",
    "unfortunately this solution is difficult to implement in practice , since the yukawa coupling gives a @xmath15-dependent mass that mixes two different 5d fermions . even neglecting inter - generational mixing ,",
    "this @xmath15-dependent mixing makes it impossible to get analytic solutions except in the very particular case of common bulk dirac mass for the two five - dimensional fermion fields coupled through the higgs .",
    "this idea has been further explored recently , for common bulk dirac masses and different values of the higgs profile in  @xcite .",
    "a full analysis of the implications of bulk fermions in ew and flavor physics requires , however , to go beyond the particular case of common bulk dirac masses .",
    "recall that the only link that bulk fermions have to the background they live in comes from the mass term .",
    "a constant mass term gives information about the metric but it does not about the dilaton .",
    "a natural assumption is therefore to consider that , besides the constant bulk dirac mass , bulk fermions acquire a @xmath15-dependent mass that comes from a direct coupling to the dilaton .",
    "this mass provides the the missing link with the soft wall , shielding the fermions from the deep ir without the need of the yukawa coupling . in the most general case",
    ", this mass can mix different generations , which would make the coupled first order equation impossible to solve analytically .",
    "however , we can neglect inter - generational mixing in the bulk dirac masses and introduce it through yukawa couplings .",
    "provided we do not introduce too large 5d yukawa couplings we can treat ewsb perturbatively in which case the inter - generational mixing given by the yukawa couplings does not represent any technical problem .",

    "a standard expansion in kk modes , @xmath41 with @xmath42 gives the equations for the fermionic profiles @xmath43 the orthonormality condition @xmath44 then gives the action as a sum over four - dimensional dirac kk modes and possibly massless zero modes , @xmath45 \\psi^{(n)}.\\ ] ] the first order coupled equations for the fermionic profiles can be iterated to give two decoupled second order differential equations @xmath46 f_n^{l , r}(z ) = 0.\\ ] ] inserting the expression of the metric and the mass , we get for the lh profile , @xmath47 f_n^l = 0\\,,\\ ] ] while the rh solution is identical to the lh one with the identification @xmath48 .",

    "the linear equations of motion guarantee that once one of the two profiles is normalized , the other one also is .",
    "the masses and the possible presence of zero modes is determined by the boundary conditions ( bc ) .",
    "model building in hard wall models makes use of four different combinations of bc for fermions .",
    "$ ] where a @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) means that the rh ( lh ) chirality has dirichlet bc ( it vanishes ) at the corresponding brane .",
    "the first and second signs correspond to the uv and ir branes respectively .",
    "more complicated bc are sometimes needed , but they can be constructed in general from these basic building blocks , that we would like to be able to realize in soft wall models .",
    "the bc at the uv brane can be imposed in exactly the same fashion as in hard wall models . on the other hand ,",
    "the ir bc in the soft wall are fixed to the normalizability condition and we can not impose further bc in the ir . as we will see , however , the choice of the sign of @xmath58 allows us to simulate , in the soft wall , the effect that different ir bc have in hard wall models .",
    "let us start with the analysis of * zero modes*. if we set @xmath59 , the two first order differential equations decouple and we can solve for them immediately , @xmath60 if we choose @xmath61 $ ] uv bc , then @xmath62 and similarly @xmath63 $ ] implies @xmath64 .",
    "thus we can only have at most one chiral zero mode .",
    "this chiral zero mode will be normalizable only if @xmath65 , for a lh zero mode , or @xmath66 for a rh mode .",

    "it is obvious that for @xmath111 , for which we can obtain hierarchical fermion masses through wave function localization , similar scaling with the masses as the one that leads to a rs gim protection occurs in the soft wall .",
    "thus , one would expect that models with a soft wall behave in a very similar way as hard wall models do regarding flavor physics  @xcite .",
    "the validity of the approximation we are employing in this work , namely a perturbative treatment of ewsb , has been recently subject to debate in hard wall models ( see for instance  @xcite ) . in such models , it is clear that , if one was able to include the full tower of kk modes and diagonalized the infinite resulting mass matrix , the results should be equivalent to including ewsb effects exactly through the equations of motion .",

    "the validity of a perturbative treatment of ewsb is not so obvious in soft wall models , since the extra dimension extends to infinity and higgs effects in the deep ir could modify the equations of motion in a way that can not be reproduced with a finite number of modes computed in the absence of ewsb and a perturbative inclusion of the latter .",

    "however , the kk expansion in the absence of ewsb is well defined and all fields , including the zero modes are shielded from the deep ir .",
    "we can therefore expect , in general , ewsb effects to be a small perturbation and a finite number of kk modes to give a good enough approximation .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to check the validity of the approximation at the quantitative level , especially in the case of the top quark , which is expected to suffer the strongest deviations . even more so in soft wall models due to the fact we mentioned above that heavier kk modes propagate deeper in the ir and therefore get larger mass mixings .",

    "we use the calculation of these two observables presented in  @xcite , which extended previous calculations  @xcite to a general enough set - up able to accommodate our fermionic spectrum .",

    "first , we are using as an example a very minimal fermionic spectrum , with no particularly light fermion kk modes .",
    "this is enough to prove that models of ewsb with a soft wall are compatible with ew precision tests for relatively light kk gauge boson modes .",
    "however , one could expect a richer behavior , similar to the one observed in hard wall models , if a more complicated fermionic spectrum , including twisted bc and bulk mixing terms is considered .",
    "second , we have mentioned above that heavy kk modes propagate deeper in the ir and therefore they couple more strongly to the higgs .",
    "this results in a slower decoupling of heavy modes regarding their contribution to the @xmath8 parameter ( the @xmath176 coupling is less sensitive to this effect ) .",
    "in fact , we have observed that the @xmath8 parameter is quite unstable against the addition of new fermion kk modes for the first few modes and it stabilizes into a fixed value only after the inclusion of a relatively large @xmath225 number of kk levels .",
    "note that , because of the scaling @xmath226 , the addition of many modes does not mean that we have to go to very high scales before the @xmath8 parameter is stable .",
    "this effect worsens the more towards the ir the higgs is localized ( _ i.e. _ the larger @xmath205 is ) . for values",
    "@xmath227 , the number of modes required to stabilize the @xmath8 parameter gets close to the limit of strong coupling and it is difficult to make precise quantitative predictions .",
    "thus , we will show most of our results for @xmath228 , although we have checked that these results do not change qualitatively when @xmath205 gets closer to @xmath229 .     as a function of @xmath230 for different values of @xmath231 with fixed @xmath232 tev , @xmath233 , @xmath234 and @xmath228 .",
    "[ tvsc0 t ] ]    the results we have obtained for the @xmath8 parameter and the @xmath210 coupling can be summarized as follows .    * the * @xmath8 parameter * is negative in a large portion of parameter space , as was already observed in hard - wall models with the same fermionic quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "it is negative , with a very mild dependence on @xmath235 for values @xmath236 , whereas it develops a strong dependence on the two parameters @xmath235 for values of @xmath237 becoming quickly positive and of order one .",
    "this behavior can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ tvsc0 t ] where we plot the @xmath8 parameter as a function of @xmath230 for different values of @xmath231 .",
    "the behavior shown extends to positive values of @xmath230 without any significant change . *",
    "the * @xmath3 coupling * is much less sensitive to the different localization parameters , @xmath223 .",
    "in fact , it is not even very sensitive to the particular value of @xmath20 ( provided it is of @xmath238 tev@xmath239 size ) for a fixed value of the higgs profile .",
    "the reason is that , increasing @xmath21 , which makes the kk modes more massive and therefore should decouple them , also makes the higgs more ir localized , which increases the required value of @xmath99 and the coupling among the heavy kk modes in such a way that both effects almost cancel each other giving rise to an essentially constant value of the @xmath176 coupling @xmath240 .",
    "this effect is in principle also present in the @xmath8 parameter but it is overcome by the larger number of heavy modes that contribute in that case and the strong dependence on @xmath235 .",
    "our analysis of the contribution to ew precision observables from the fermionic sector showed two main features for the class of models we have considered : the @xmath176 coupling receives a non - negligible , almost constant correction @xmath241 , and the @xmath8 parameter can get essentially any value for @xmath242 . using these features",

    "the main reason is the almost constant contribution to the @xmath176 coupling that creates some tension in the fit .",
    "of course , a richer fermionic spectrum than we have considered in our minimal model could result in a different value of this coupling and therefore a smaller bound .",
    "models with warped extra dimensions and a soft ir wall represent a more general approach to ewsb than hard wall models .",
    "the spectrum of kk excitations is sensitive to the details of the soft wall and an analysis of the bosonic sector , assuming the sm fermions to be localized at the uv brane , shows that current ew constraints are compatible with very light @xmath238 tev new resonances .",

    "we have developed the tools to analyze bulk fermions in soft wall models with great generality . by assuming a position dependent dirac mass for the bulk fermions , which could be generated by a direct coupling to the soft wall , we can perform the kk expansion of bulk fermions in a very general set - up .",
    "our construction reproduces well the most relevant features of bulk fermions present in hard wall models , like the effect of non - trivial ir boundary conditions , the presence of ultra - light modes for twisted boundary conditions , flavor universality of couplings of uv localized fermions to kk gauge bosons or hierarchical yukawa couplings through wave function localization . using these techniques",
    "we have studied the flavor structure of realistic models with the result that a similar flavor protection as the one observed in hard wall models can be expected .",
    "similarly , we have computed the contribution of the top sector to ew precision observables and shown that simple realistic models with custodial symmetry and kk excitations as light as @xmath249 can be compatible with all ew precision tests . furthermore , the particular realization of the soft wall we have considered predicts a linear scaling of the mass _ squared _ of the kk excitations . as an example , for certain higgs profile ( @xmath228 ) we can have , at the @xmath245 c.l . , the following spectrum of new gauge boson kk masses @xmath250 detailed analyses in hard wall models showed that masses @xmath251 tev in the case of kk gluons  @xcite and @xmath252 tev in the case of kk excitations of the ew bosons  @xcite could be reached at the lhc with @xmath253 .",
    "it would therefore seem that the first and maybe even the second mode of kk gluons could be observable at the lhc although a detailed analysis , taking into account the details of the spectrum in our model , is required to fully assess the lhc reach .    regarding the fermionic sector , we have chosen a very minimal set - up , with just the minimal number of five - dimensional fields to reproduce the observed spectrum .",
    "in that case no particularly light kk fermions are present in the spectrum . due to the boundary conditions , the kk excitations of @xmath214 , which from the sm point of view is an @xmath162 doublet of hypercharge @xmath216 are among the lightest new fermions with a mass @xmath254 tev .",
    "this multiplet includes a charge @xmath255 quark that was shown to be easily reachable in an early lhc run through pair production provided it is light enough  @xcite .",

    "most likely , masses as heavy as the ones we obtain are not reachable at the lhc through pair production .",

    "this simple fermionic spectrum was chosen for simplicity .",
    "it is not a constraint coming from the soft wall .",
    "richer structures are easy to implement . for instance",
    ", one could simulate the spectrum used in hard wall realistic models of gauge - higgs unification  @xcite by introducing further bulk fermions with twisted boundary conditions and a position dependent mass term mixing them . in that case",
    "we can only solve analytically for a common @xmath15-independent mass , which is still tolerable for the top quark .",
    "this richer fermionic spectrum would lead to lighter quarks associated to the top and could make new regions in parameter space compatible with ew precision data through their contribution to ew precision observables .",
    "bulk fermions can be also implemented in actual composite higgs models in the soft wall  @xcite using the techniques developed in this work .",
    "our results show that soft wall models have the potential to become realistic models of ewsb readily accessible at the lhc .",
    "we have gone a step forward towards this goal by including with great generality bulk fermions in these models .",
    "however , several further steps need to be taken before we can consider these models a full satisfactory solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "one of the most pressing open questions is that of the stability of the soft wall and the corresponding @xmath257 hierarchy . also , given the new bounds and the different patterns of masses and mixings that can be obtained in soft wall models , a new analysis of the lhc reach would be welcome",
