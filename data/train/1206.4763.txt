    "the main part of the results of multi - loop calculus in high - energy physics has been done as an expansion in terms of @xmath7 that is the parameter of dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "however , one - loop massless diagrams can be calculated in all order in @xmath7 and can be represented in terms of appell s hypergeometric function @xcite . to calculate any loop ( in momentum space ) integral it would be good to have a technique that reduces number of loops by one in a recursive manner .",
    "such a method exists in @xmath0 space - time dimensions for triangle - ladder diagrams .",
    "it was discovered in early eighties by belokurov and usyukina @xcite .",
    "we refer to that construction as to belokurov - usyukina loop reduction technique . as to our knowledge",
    ", there was no analog of this loop reduction procedure in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "the result of calculation of the triangle ladder diagrams in @xmath0 is ud functions @xcite .",
    "their properties , in particular the invariance with respect to fourier transform , have been studied in refs . @xcite and",
    "their mb transforms have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose generalization of the belokurov - usyukina loop reduction technique to non - integer dimensions .",
    "in particular , we consider a two - loop triangle diagram in which the propagator indices in the position space are @xmath9 or 1 .",
    "we use uniqueness method and method of integration by parts @xcite . the detailed step - by - step construction for @xmath0 space - time dimensions",
    "is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we construct analogs of fig .",
    "( 2 ) and fig . ( 3 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite with slightly modified indices of line in order to apply uniqueness technique to the case of triangle ladder diagram in non - integer number of dimensions .",
    "the result of the reduction is presented in three figures , fig.(2 ) is continuation of fig.(1 ) , and fig.(3 ) is continuation of fig . ( 2 ) .",
    "the transformations depicted in the diagrams are integration by parts , triangle - star and star - triangle relations ( for review of these relations , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as we can see , the final result depicted in fig .",
    "( 3 ) is a sum of one - loop diagrams .",
    "each of the diagrams on the r.h.s . of fig.(3 ) can be transformed to the momentum space in which the result for each one of them is a combination of appell s functions @xcite . to our knowledge , it is the first known case when two - loop diagram in non - integer number of dimensions can be reduced to the appell s function @xmath3 in all order in the regularization parameter @xmath7 for arbitrary kinematic region in the momentum space .",

    "@xcite is assumed in the position space to avoid powers of @xmath13 in figures .",
    "the factor @xmath14 that appears in figures ( 1)-(3 ) is @xmath15 this generalizes the corresponding factor @xmath14 of ref .",
    "the condition for auxiliary parameters @xmath16 remains the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath17 at the end of the calculation we have to take the limit of vanishing these @xmath7-terms .",
    "we have shown that the loop reduction in non - integer number of dimensions apparently exists .",
    "the two - loop diagram in @xmath8 dimensions has been represented as one - loop diagrams in the same kinematic region in the momentum space .",
    "we have considered an arbitrary kinematic region and even on - shell external momenta can be taken . in that case the result remains finite and regularized dimensionally in terms of poles in regularization parameter @xmath4 however , not all of the indices in the position space are @xmath18 this index in the position space means index 1 in the momentum space , which corresponds to the physical case of momentum propagator in the regularized ( @xmath19)-dimensional theory .                      v.  a.  smirnov , `` evaluating feynman integrals , '' springer tracts in modern physics * 211 * ( 2004 ) , springer , germany z.  bern , l.  j.  dixon and v.  a.  smirnov , `` iteration of planar amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory at three loops and beyond , '' phys .  rev .",
