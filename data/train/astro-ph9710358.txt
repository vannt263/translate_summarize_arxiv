    "the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ) is a survey of flat - spectrum radio sources whose primary purpose is the discovery of new radio - loud gravitational lens systems .",
    "a survey of 10,000 radio sources is being undertaken .",
    "those sources which , when observed with the vla at 8.4  ghz at a resolution of 200  mas , are found to possess multiple components or very complex structure are followed - up at higher resolution with merlin and the vlba .",
    "higher resolution allows one to separate the genuine lens systems , which consist of multiple flat - spectrum components , from systems containing a flat - spectrum core and steep - spectrum extended radio emission .",
    "the discovery of the lenses b1600 + 434 , b1608 + 656 and b0712 + 472 has already been announced ( jackson et al . 1995 ; myers et al . 1995 ; jackson et al .",
