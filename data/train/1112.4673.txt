    "in the present paper we study the curvature of a free boundary which comes up in some obstacle type problems , more specifically laplacian growth ( hele - shaw flow moving boundary problem ) , quadrature domains and partial balayage .",
    "the final aim of the investigations is to show that the free boundary in question satisfies a certain inner ball condition ( a specific upper bound on the curvature ) .",
    "this goal has previously been achieved in the case of two dimensions ( see @xcite and @xcite ; compare also @xcite ) . here",
    "we shall give some partial results ( but no complete solution ) in higher dimensions , and in passing also obtain a new proof for the two dimensional case .",
    "the geometric property we aim at proving can most easily be stated in terms of quadrature domains for subharmonic functions @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 a positive borel measure with compact support in @xmath1 .",
    "a bounded open set @xmath2 is called a _",
    "quadrature open set _ for subharmonic functions with respect to @xmath0 if @xmath3 and @xmath4 for all integrable ( with respect to lebesgue measure @xmath5 ) subharmonic functions @xmath6 in @xmath7 . a quadrature open set which is connected is a _",
    "quadrature domain_. there is a natural process of balayage of measures to a prescribed density ( partial balayage ) by which @xmath7 can be constructed from @xmath0 when it exists , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this balayage process is also equivalent to solving a certain obstacle problem @xcite .    in terms of the difference @xmath8 between the newtonian potentials of @xmath0 and @xmath7 , the latter considered as a body of density one ,",
    "the quadrature property spells out to @xmath9 the function @xmath10 appearing here is sometimes called the modified schwarz potential of @xmath11 , see @xcite for example .",
    "what has been proved in two dimensions , and what we like to extend to higher dimension , is that @xmath7 in the above situation can be written as the union of open balls centered in the closed convex hull @xmath12 of @xmath13 : @xmath14 here @xmath15 denotes the radius of the ball at @xmath16 , allowing the possibility @xmath17 , i.e. , that the ball is empty .",
    "we refer to ( [ innerball ] ) as @xmath7 satisfying the inner ball property with respect to @xmath12 . for further discussion and motivations in the present context , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the inner ball property concerns the geometry of @xmath11 outside any closed half - space @xmath18 containing @xmath13 . by a certain `` localization '' procedure the part @xmath19 of @xmath7 which is outside",
    "@xmath18 can be shown to be identical with a quadrature open set for some positive measure with support on @xmath20 , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for this reason it is enough to prove ( [ innerball ] ) in the case that @xmath0 has support in a hyperplane , and by a further localization one may even assume @xmath0 to have a continuous density on it .",
    "for convenience we shall take the hyperplane in question to be @xmath21 .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite , @xcite ) that given any positive measure with compact support in this hyperplane , which we identify with @xmath22 , there is a uniquely determined quadrature open set , which moreover is symmetric about the hyperplane and is convex in the @xmath23-direction ( i.e. , the intersection with any straight line perpendicular to the hyperplane is connected ) .",
    "thus the quadrature open set can be described in terms of a graph of a function @xmath24 defined in an open subset @xmath25 of the hyperplane .",
    "it is known from the regularity theory of free boundaries ( see @xcite , @xcite , and in the present context @xcite ) that this function @xmath24 is real analytic .",
    "it will be enough to consider the case that @xmath25 is connected , because in the disconnected case the discussions will apply to each component separately .",
    "in the paper we shall therefore study the geometry of quadrature domains for a measure with support in the hyperplane @xmath22 , the corresponding modified schwarz potential @xmath10 , and various differential geometric objects derived from it .",
    "the paper consists of two main parts .",
    "the first part starts with some differential geometric preliminaries ( section  [ sec : diffgeom ] ) and ends up with a proof of equivalence of several different formulations of the inner ball condition ( section  [ sec : innerball ] ) .",
    "this part is analogous to a corresponding part in @xcite , but new difficulties appear in the higher dimensional case . in the second part of the paper , section  [ sec : boundaries ] ,",
    "we develop tools for studying the geometry by means of vector fields and differential forms defined in terms of @xmath10 .    to briefly explain , in terms the two dimensional situation , what we do in the second part of the paper , let @xmath26 denote the part of the quadrature domain which lies in the upper half space ( half plane ) and let @xmath27 be the schwarz function ( see @xcite , @xcite ) of @xmath28 .",
    "this is in our case given by @xmath29 , it is analytic in @xmath26 , and equals @xmath30 on @xmath28 .",
    "what we study in the second part of the paper is the higher dimensional counterpart of the mapping @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 the last member referring to polar coordinates .",
    "we also study in higher dimensions that curve @xmath33 which in two dimensions is defined by @xmath34 . in the two dimensional case",
    "a proof of the inner ball property can be based on the topological property of @xmath33 that it separates the two domains @xmath35 and @xmath36 from each other , see @xcite .",
    "there seems to be no direct counterpart of this kind of proof in higher dimensions .",
    "a slightly different proof in two dimensions uses the argument principle for @xmath37 , see corollary  [ cor : main ] in the present paper .",
    "we have not been able to generalize this proof either to higher dimensions , even though we think that such a proof may not be completely out of reach .",
    "at least we have computed the relevant mapping degree of @xmath37 in higher dimensions , and this result , theorem  [ thm : main ] , may be considered to be the main result in the second part of the paper . another avenue which we have pursued to some extent is the investigation of the general behaviour of the curve @xmath33 .",
    "this curve starts out at the origin and reaches @xmath28 only at points where the largest inner ball centered at the origin touches @xmath28 , see proposition  [ prop : gamma ] .",
    "if we could establish for example that @xmath33 were a smooth curve ( no branchings ) a proof of the inner ball property would not be far away .",
    "thus we hope that the partial results we obtain in this paper will turn out to be useful in forthcoming attempts to prove the inner ball property for quadrature domains , explicitly formulated in conjecture  [ conj : main ] .",
    "in this section we decompose the coordinates in @xmath1 typically as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "we denote by @xmath41 the upper half space .",
    "let @xmath24 be a positive , twice continuously differentiable function defined in a bounded domain @xmath42 and assume that @xmath43 as @xmath44 ( the boundary as a subset of @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is convenient to set @xmath45 for @xmath46 , and then @xmath24 is defined and continuous on all @xmath22 .",
    "set @xmath47 and for any subset @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the normal line of @xmath28 at a point @xmath50 is given in parametrized form as @xmath51 and it intersects the hyperplane @xmath22 for @xmath52 , i.e. , at the _ foot point _ @xmath53 let @xmath54 be the part of the normal line which is between the base point on @xmath28 and the foot point .",
    "the length of @xmath55 is @xmath56    for any point @xmath57 there is at least one closest point @xmath50 on @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath58 and , in particular , @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath55 is one of the radii in @xmath60 .",
    "it follows that we always have inclusions    @xmath61    also , @xmath62      we shall discuss @xmath28 from a differential geometric point of view .",
    "we consider it as a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath63 and with coordinates @xmath64 .",
    "the riemannian metric is that inherited from @xmath1 .",
    "we shall write certain quantities considered as vectors in @xmath1 in bold .",
    "these involve the `` moving point '' on @xmath28 ( or lift map @xmath65 ) @xmath66 its differential ( a vector - valued differential form ) @xmath67 the unit normal vector @xmath68 and its differential @xmath69 ( which becomes somewhat complicated when written out in components ) . for a point @xmath57",
    "we sometimes write it in bold if we think of it as the vector from the origin to @xmath16 .    a tangent vector @xmath70 on @xmath28",
    "may be thought of in an abstract way as a derivation : @xmath71 letting this @xmath70 act on the moving point @xmath72 or , equivalently , letting the differential @xmath73 act on @xmath70 gives the same tangent vector regarded as a vector embedded in @xmath1 : @xmath74    in classical differential geometry ( see for example @xcite ) one associates to any hypersurface in euclidean space two fundamental forms .",
    "the first fundamental form is the metric tensor , which gives the inner product on each tangent space .",
    "it is in our case @xmath75 where the dot denotes the scalar product in @xmath1 .",
    "the second fundamental form is ( up to a sign ) @xmath76 it contains information on how @xmath77 rotates in different directions , i.e. on how @xmath28 is curved within @xmath1 .",
    "the above expression for @xmath78 can be derived as follows : since @xmath77 is orthogonal to @xmath28 we have @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",
    "therefore @xmath81 proving the formula .",
    "both fundamental forms are symmetric covariant 2-tensors , i.e. , symmetric bilinear forms on each tangent space .",
    "when considered as bilinear forms we shall call them @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively ( namely @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) .",
    "the above formulas then mean that for ( abstract ) tangent vectors @xmath70 and @xmath86 we have @xmath87 note that @xmath82 is positive definite .",
    "the principal curvatures of @xmath28 and the corresponding principal directions are the eigenvalues and eigendirections of the derivative of the gauss normal map , taking any point @xmath88 onto the normal vector at the point : @xmath89 ; the derivative is the induced linear map between the tangent spaces , intuitively @xmath90 . in terms of abstract tangent vectors this becomes @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , and one can also say that it is the map obtained when expressing the second fundamental form in terms of the first : @xmath93    it is well - known ( and easy to prove ) that these eigenvalues and eigendirections coincide with the stationary points and corresponding stationary directions for the quotient of the fundamental forms , namely for the map @xmath94 ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) . for example , the smallest eigenvalue ( the smallest principal curvature ) coincides with the minimum value of @xmath97 .",
    "next we introduce the function @xmath99 namely half of the squared distance from points on @xmath28 to the origin .",
