    "the continuing development and utilization of microwave applications today make electromagnetic interference a serious problem that needs to be solved .",
    "although high conductivity metals are very effective for high frequency electromagnetic wave shielding , in many cases they are not suitable when weak or zero reflection is required ( such as for radar stealth technology ) .",
    "while metals shield the object by reflecting the incident radiation away , microwave absorbing materials ( mam ) are designed to absorb the radiation and therefore effectively reduce the reflection . strong absorption and weak reflection",
    "will lead to a large negative value of reflection loss ( @xmath6 ) and are therefore identified as two strict requirements for high loss mams .",
    "minimum @xmath6 values as low as down to less than @xmath12 db have been reported for some materials , most of them are ferri / ferro - magnetic based nanoparticles or composites , _",
    "e.g. _ carbonyl iron@xmath13batio@xmath14 composite ( @xmath15 db ) @xcite , zno@xmath13carbonyl - iron composite ( @xmath16 db ) @xcite , la@xmath17sr@xmath18mno@xmath14@xmath13 polyaniline composite ( @xmath19 db ) @xcite , etc , indicating the dominant role of magnetic losses over the others such as dielectric and conduction losses .",
    "dielectrics usually have small permeability and , visa versa , most magnetic materials have small permittivity . to maximize the absorption capability by combining dielectric and magnetic losses , and",
    "since zero reflection can be achieved in a mam that has equal permittivity and permeability ( @xmath20 ) to satisfy the impedance matching condition @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the impedance of the free space ) , much attention has been paid to multiferroic and magneto - dielectric materials .",
    "la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 is known as a dielectric compound that has a colossal dielectric constant of up to more than @xmath23 at room temperature @xcite .",
    "while la@xmath24nio@xmath2 is an antiferromagnet , the substitution of sr for la introduces holes into the system and suppresses the antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "experimental magnetic data show that la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 is a paramagnet at room temperature @xcite , suggesting that the magnetic loss may be negligibly small .",
    "with such a large imbalance between permittivity and permeability , @xmath25 , and insignificant magnetic loss , the material is therefore not expected to have a low @xmath6 . in this letter , we show that la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 in fact exhibits a strong microwave absorption capability at the resonant frequencies ; for a layer of 3.0 mm , the minimum @xmath6 reaches down to @xmath26 db at @xmath279.7 ghz .",

    "it is possible that a resonance peak for this sample would occur at a frequency very close to ( but higher than ) 18 ghz , considering the variation of the resonance frequency @xmath34 on the thickness , as presented below .",

    "[ fig.2]a exhibits a deep minimum of @xmath57 db at @xmath58 ghz , which is very close to the frequency @xmath35 ( @xmath27 14.0 - 14.3 ghz ) where @xmath59 @xmath9 .",
    "the close value of @xmath34 to @xmath35 would suggest that the strong microwave absorption would be attributed to the resonance caused by impedance matching .",
    "however , the resonance could also be caused by a phase matching if the phases of the reflected waves from the two sample s surfaces differ by @xmath60 . in this case , the resonance frequency and its harmonics are given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the speed of light in the incident medium and @xmath63 , 1 , 2 , ... nevertheless , since the closest @xmath37 value ( 13.9 ghz , obtained for @xmath64 ) is also quite close to @xmath34 , it is difficult to determine conclusively which mechanism is responsible for the deep negative @xmath6 at @xmath34 for this @xmath56 mm sample .",
    "the phase - matching calculation for the @xmath65 mm sample predicts @xmath66 ghz for @xmath67 and @xmath2718 ghz for @xmath68 ; both are the lower and upper frequency limits of our measurement system .    figs .",
    "[ fig.2]b and [ fig.2]c display the @xmath48 and @xmath52 curves for the @xmath69 mm and 3.0 mm samples . with increasing thickness from 1.5 mm to 3.0 mm , the resonance shifts to lower frequencies while the notch in @xmath6 becomes deeper . for @xmath69 mm ,",
    "the minimum of @xmath6 appears almost at the same frequency as that of @xmath70-matching while the phase matching frequency is a little higher , i.e. , @xmath71 ghz and @xmath72 ghz for @xmath64 .",
    "similar scenario is also obtained for @xmath73 mm : @xmath74 ghz whereas @xmath75 ghz .",
    "it is quite clear that , although the shift of the resonance to lower frequencies is qualitatively in agreement with the phase matching model , there is still a considerable difference between the calculated values of @xmath37 and the measured @xmath34 that seems to even develop with increasing the sample s thickness .",
    "hence , both of the increasing deviation of @xmath37 from @xmath34 and the coincidence of @xmath34 and @xmath35 indicate that the resonance observed in these samples belongs to the @xmath70-matching mechanism .",
    "dielectrics absorb microwave s energy and convert it to heat via the rotation of polar molecules at high frequencies and the ion - drag at low frequencies .",
    "the @xmath70-matching resonance itself does not necessarily cause any energy dissipation of the electromagnetic wave , but favors the wave s propagation into the sample and hence promotes the absorption .",
    "the @xmath48 curves in figs .",
    "2a - c show that there are at least two frequencies ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) where the @xmath76 condition is satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , a strong absorption is obtained only at @xmath35 while there is no observable anomaly ( except for a shoulder for the @xmath56 mm sample ) in the @xmath52 curve at @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that , although @xmath70-matching occurs at both @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the energy dissipation is not promoted at @xmath36 . according to eq .",
    "[ eqn2 ] , perfect energy absorption , @xmath77 , occurs if @xmath78 @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath79 @xmath9 and the imaginary part @xmath80 .",
    "a deviation of @xmath81 from zero will reduce @xmath6 to a finite value ; the larger the relative value of @xmath38 is , the larger the minimum @xmath6 will be at the resonance .",
    "our data show that the @xmath56 mm sample has @xmath82 @xmath9 and 317.2 @xmath9 at @xmath35 and @xmath36 , while those for @xmath73 mm are @xmath83 @xmath9 and 242 @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the larger values of @xmath38 may explain the absence of resonant absorption at the @xmath36 frequencies .",
    "this seems to be similar to the analysis reported by pang _",
    "@xcite where the authors introduced an entity of imaginary thickness component that becomes zero at the absorption resonance .",
    "in addition , the variation of @xmath38 at @xmath35 ( see table [ table1 ] ) is also in agreement with the decrease of the minimum @xmath6 values ( from @xmath84 db to @xmath26 db ) as @xmath5 increases from 1.5 mm to 3.0 mm .",
    "@xmath38 is therefore could be considered as the mismatch at the @xmath70-matching condition .",
    "it is also noticeable that the @xmath52 curves do not show any deep minimum at the phase matching frequencies .",
    "the reason may lie into the use of the transparent backing plate for the samples .",
    "the electromagnetic wave reflects at all the boundaries between two different impedance media .",
    "however , without a metal backing plate , the internal reflection at the back side of the sample would be much weaker than the reflection at the front side .",
    "moreover , the internal reflection wave is also absorbed again by the sample .",
    "so even the phase matching resonance does occur , no significant cancelation of the reflected signals would be detected .",
    "the shoulder appearing in the @xmath85 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig.2]a may belong to the phase matching effect because of the sample s small thickness ( @xmath49 mm ) . the @xmath70-matching solution for this shoulder",
    "is ruled out due to the large value of @xmath38 at @xmath86 .",
    "considering the proximity of @xmath87 and @xmath37 , we expect that using metal backing plates for these la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 absorbers would either further decrease the minimum of @xmath6 or widen the absorption band by combining the two matching effects .    with further increasing the thickness to 3.5 mm , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.2]c , the microwave absorption is strongly suppressed .",
    "no @xmath70-matching condition could be observed as the whole @xmath48 curve lies well above @xmath22 .",
    "though , the @xmath52 curve still exhibits a notch at @xmath88 ghz . a calculation",
    "according to the phase matching model gives @xmath89 ghz ( with @xmath64 ) , which is far above @xmath34 .",
    "apparently , none of the mentioned matching phenomena would be the mechanism for the absorption peak at @xmath88 ghz .",
    "however , since @xmath90 reaches its minimum of 718 @xmath9 at 8.4 ghz that is closely equal to @xmath34 , this minimum in @xmath90 could be responsible for the deep of @xmath6 at @xmath34 .",
    "in summary , we have observed very low microwave @xmath6 values for the powders of la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 nanoparticles despite the large imbalance between permittivity and permeability . for @xmath91 mm ,",
    "the resonance takes place according to the @xmath70-matching mechanism , where @xmath38 could be considered as a mismatch parameter .",
    "the smallest minimum @xmath6 is observed for the absorber with the matching thickness of @xmath7 mm and in the radar x - band .",
    "the @xmath70-matching condition is not attained in thick samples ( @xmath92 mm ) that have @xmath11 at all frequencies but the peak absorption occurs where the impedance reaches its minimum .",
    "we suggest that ( i ) using a metal backing plate to combine the @xmath70- and phase - matching resonances and ( ii ) mixing la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 with magnetic fillers to balance out @xmath93 and @xmath94 would further improve the material s microwave absorption performance .",
