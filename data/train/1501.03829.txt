    "the evolved laser interferometer space antenna ( elisa ) is a mission concept proposed as a large ( l - class ) space mission of the european space agency ( esa ) designed to detect low - frequency gravitational radiation .",
    "it will be formed by three drag - free spacecraft in triangular configuration with one - million - kilometer arms , with each spacecraft containing one or two `` free - falling '' macroscopic bodies called test masses ( tms ) @xcite .",
    "gravitational wave ( gw ) detection requires interferometry measurement at the picometer level between two test masses along an arm due to the tidal deformation of spacetime caused by gws .",
    "for this reason , the environment where such bodies will be located must be very quiet ( in relation to disturbances exerting forces in the bodies ) , otherwise the motion provoked by the different noise sources perturbing the free floating bodies would conceal the gw signal . the lisa top - level requirement in terms of acceleration noise @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) in the frequency band between @xmath3",
    "is plotted in fig.[fig : req ] . at frequencies below 1 mhz , the noise is dominated by the residual acceleration noise of @xmath4 caused by magnetic or temperature forces among others @xcite . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the sensitivity is limited by the arm - length - measurement noise in the interferometer @xcite .    ]    owing to the magnetic properties of the tms , more precisely their magnetization @xmath5 and magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 , one of the main contributions to the total acceleration noise budget is the magnetic field @xmath7 in the spacecraft .",
    "the force on the tm volume @xmath8 induced by a magnetic disturbance is given by    @xmath9{\\bf b }             \\right\\rangle v.\\ ] ]    since the magnetic background in the spacecraft can induce a residual acceleration noise on the tms and therefore deteriorate the efficiency of the instrument , its magnetic contribution needs to be quantified and suppressed from the main data stream . for this reason ,",
    "magnetic sensors are needed to map the environmental magnetic field and its gradient .",
    "these magnetometers can not be placed at the sites of the tms , which is the region of interest , in consequence an interpolation method needs to be implemented@xcite .",
    "the low - frequency noise limits the performance of the on - board instrumentation .",
    "hence , magnetometers and optimized electronics need to be assessed in the lisa bandwidth , since at sub - mhz frequencies , sensor noise is usually dominated by the @xmath0 contribution and thermal drifts .",
    "previous studies on this subject were carried out with magnetoresistance - based magnetometers , suggesting the technology as a potential option for elisa@xcite .",
    "we are currently investigating sensors based on alkali - vapor cells @xcite as an alternative to fluxgate magnetometers , which are commonly employed in space applications .",
    "alkali - vapor magnetometers are absolute sensors , since the spin - precession frequency is related to the magnitude of the field by fundamental constants . in this regard",
    ", they are unlike fluxgates and magnetoresistances , which measure small changes in the field but not its actual value without precise calibration .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that atomic magnetometers might be better for low - frequency applications . theoretically , their sensing elements are not subject to intrinsic @xmath0 noise , although in practical situations , there are noise sources that might be relevant at very low frequencies .",
    "for instance , drifts in the power , wavelength , or polarization of the pump and probe lasers will determine the `` light shift '' ; a light - induced shift in the alkali zeeman energy sublevels which can mimic the effects of an applied magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the overall light shift will also be influenced by changing cell temperature or alkali - vapor density , which will affect attenuation of the beams within the vapor .",
    "other potential sources are the drifts in the phase or duty cycle of the pump laser waveform , intrinsic noise and temperature dependence of the electronics and changes in the stray magnetic field from the components surrounding the vapor cell . by definition ,",
    "the latter is not categorized as magnetometer noise .",
    "nevertheless , it is crucial to disentangle the influence of magnetic - field drifts so that we may study the intrinsic sensor noise .",
    "it is important to remark that elisa is a demanding mission in terms of low - noise / low - frequency concepts . for these reasons ,",
    "the study below the corner frequency of the @xmath0 noise is critical and it differs from the wideband applications , where usually only the noise floors are of concern . some of the estimates we performed are based on the @xmath0 behavior , which is characterized by the white - noise floor and the corner frequency .",
    "other parameters also critical in the low - frequency band , such as ambient temperature fluctuations , are derived from laboratory measurements .",
    "atom - based magnetometers are the most sensitive devices to measure magnetic fields , furthermore they do not need the bulky and expensive cryogenic refrigeration required in superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) . the _ spin - projection - noise - limited _",
    "sensitivity @xmath10 of an atomic magnetometer during a measurement period @xmath11 is given by @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the atoms and @xmath10 scales with the size and temperature of the cell by means of the coherence time @xmath14 and the total number of atoms @xmath15 .",
    "since the fundamental sensitivity limit of atomic magnetometers is much better than the required sensitivity for elisa , we can trade off sensitivity for size / temperature of the cell , motivating the technology for space missions .",
    "previous results assuming the spin - projection noise as the limiting noise source , suggest that magnetometer containing optimized cells with a size between @xmath16 and @xmath17 can reach noise levels around @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding cell temperature may vary from room temperature for the largest cell to @xmath20 for the @xmath17 cell@xcite .",
    "various techniques to measure the larmor precession frequency @xmath21 of atomic spins have achieved excellent sensitivities at room temperature , although most of these techniques have been studied at higher frequencies ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "our interest consists in the detection of small magnetic fluctuations in the low - frequency region and at ambient temperature .",
    "hence , based on the experience with the magnetic diagnostics for lisa pathfinder ( elisa s precursor mission ) constituted by a set of four tri - axial fluxgate magnetometers and two coils@xcite , the main sensor selection criteria for elisa are viability for miniaturization , low noise in the millihertz region and small back - action effect on the spacecraft environment .",
    "this is due to , firstly , the fact that space applications have strict requirements in size and weight , and smaller sensors allow more of them to be incorporated in the spacecraft .",
    "furthermore , spatial resolution is increased with a more compact sensor head .",
    "secondly , regarding the sensor noise and frequency range , in the more demanding scenario both shall be one order of magnitude lower than the lisa pathfinder requirement ( @xmath23 at @xmath24 ) .",
    "this implies a noise level in the measurement system of    @xmath25    finally , the selected magnetometer should have sufficiently low magnetic and thermal back - action effects on the spacecraft environment to avoid disturbances on the tms @xcite .",
    "a sensor fulfilling these requirements would also be well - suited for use in magnetically sensitive fundamental physics experiments requiring long integration time , such as the search for a permanent electric dipole moment of the neutron @xcite and high - precision measurements of the weak equivalence principle using space atom interferometry in ste - quest @xcite .",
    "chip - scale magnetometers based on magnetic - resonance phenomena can be driven either with radio frequency ( rf ) fields or with modulated light .",
    "a coil - driven magnetometer@xcite with micro - fabricated vapor cell has demonstrated noise levels of @xmath26 for a bandwidth from 1 to 100hz , however the magnetic field created by the rf coils for this method could constitute a potential source of disturbances to the elisa performance @xcite .",
    "similar noise level has been measured in a frequency - modulated bell - bloom magnetometer ( fm bb ) , using also millimeter - scale cells @xcite .",
    "for the two previous arrangements the cell needs to be heated to create sufficient atomic density for the measurement , which could also be detrimental for the quiet thermal environment required in the tm region ( @xmath27 at @xmath24 for lisa pathfinder ) @xcite . in this work",
    "we study the low - frequency noise in a magnetometer prototype based on nonlinear magneto - optical rotation ( nmor ) @xcite , which retains the all - optical excitation with the advantage that the vapor cell is at room temperature and heaters are not utilized @xcite . in sec.[sec : set - up ] we discuss the test setup using nonlinear magneto - optical rotation with amplitude - modulated light ( am - nmor ) . in sec.[sec",
    ": electronic ] we analyze the noise contributions of two important circuits for the magnetic field measurements in the experiment .",
    "the experimental results are shown in sec.[sec : results ] and , finally , the main conclusions of the work are summarized in sec.[sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the sensor core is a 1-cm diameter and 3-cm long cylindrical antirelaxation - coated cell containing @xmath28 atoms .",
    "the light of a distributed - feedback ( dfb ) laser @xcite is split in a two - beam arrangement with linearly polarized probe and pump light , and it is frequency stabilized near the @xmath29 line by means of a dichroic - atomic - vapor laser lock ( davll ) @xcite .",
    "the linearly polarized pump beam is square - wave modulated with a @xmath30 duty cycle at a frequency of @xmath31 in order to generate atomic alignment @xcite .",
    "this amplitude modulation is provided by an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) with a rf of @xmath32 such that it drives the coherent precession of the atoms about the external magnetic field to be measured @xcite . the continuous probe and modulated pump beam pass through the vapor cell with approximately the same time - averaged light power of @xmath33 .",
    "finally , the amplitude of the probe optical rotation is measured with a balanced polarimeter at the modulation frequency @xmath34 , where the current difference between the two silicon photodiodes ( osd 15 - 0 ) is changed to voltage by a transimpedance amplifier ( tia ) and is then demodulated with a phase - sensitive detector .",
    "the experimental schematic is shown in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "there are different ways to measure the magnetic - resonance frequency with the same setup : we can map out the whole resonance curve by stepping the modulation frequency , or we can make a single - point measurement of the dispersive trace near the center of the resonance . for the former open - loop method ,",
    "the dynamic range and the measurement rate are limited by the narrow resonance and the slow scan of the resonance curve , respectively .",
    "the latter method requires a continuous closed - loop mode to keep the in - phase component locked , i.e. , a digital controller that follows the null output of the quadrature component or the equivalent phase signal by tuning the frequency of the pulse generator which drives the modulation .",
    "this method of magnetometer operation is also useful to track slow drifts in the measured magnetic field . as can be seen in fig.[fig : fo ] during long - term measurements ( @xmath35 hours ) , the magnetic - resonance signal used to measure the larmor frequency shows variations in the amplitude of the in - phase ( absorptive ) component , as well as the quadrature ( dispersive ) component obtained from the lock - in amplifier output . barring fluctuations in the phase of the resonance , the zero - crossing of the dispersive term ( at @xmath36 ) does not shift when either the amplitude or the width of the resonance changes .",
    "such changes can arise from variations in the cell temperature or laser power .    ) and dispersive ( @xmath37 ) components of the magnetic - resonance signal .",

    "bottom : equivalent amplitude and phase .",
    "[ fig : fo],title=\"fig : \" ]    for noise measurements , the cs cell is placed inside a five - layer @xmath38-metal shielding equipped with a solenoidal coil to apply a bias field along the probe - beam path .",
    "an external field is applied to operate the magnetometer at a frequency higher than the linewidth of the resonance , where synchronous optical pumping is employed .",
    "magnetic field fluctuations inside the shield can be caused by the thermal magnetization noise , johnson noise currents within the magnetic shield itself and unshielded ambient magnetic field fluctuations , but they are not expected to be the dominant source in our measurement ( @xmath39)@xcite . one of the critical parts of the setup in the low - frequency band is the stability of the magnetic field created by the coils , which is mostly a requirement on the coil current source .",
    "hence , special care needs to be taken in the design of the current source to avoid it becoming the dominant noise contribution in the millihertz regime and obscuring the intrinsic noise of the sensor .    in order to address the equivalent magnetic field noise of the magnetometer",
    "we record the setup parameters , namely power , wavelength , current and temperature of the laser diode , power of the pump light , current through the coil , room temperature and magnetic field , polarimeter outputs ( single - sided and differential ) and lock - in amplifier outputs .",
    "these measurements help us disentangle the different contributions to study the magnetometer noise , e.g. , how the temperature drifts can affect the electronics .",
    "the setup contains table - top optics in order to facilitate the optimization of the different parts and parameters of the experiment .",
    "however , future work will include efforts to miniaturize the magnetometer .",
    "the miniaturized design can be based on fully integrated chip - scale magnetometers@xcite or microfabricated remote sensor heads coupled to the laser and photodiodes through optical fibers@xcite .",
    "the evident benefit of the first design is the possibility to include all the components in a single chip .",
    "in contrast , the advantage of the latter approach is to keep the cell clear of possible magnetic disturbances caused by the proximity of the laser and electrical connections . besides , the second design is specially useful when an array of sensors is required since some parts can be shared , as for example the stabilized laser , aom and optical elements .",
    "as mentioned in sec.[introduction ] , there are many potential sources of magnetic - resonance frequency drift and intrinsic noise in the magnetometer setup . in this analysis",
    "we focus on two circuits that need to be carefully designed in order to minimize their contribution to the resultant total noise , these circuits have been analyzed at two different frequencies . at millihertz scales ,",
    "an important electronic noise contribution might be attributed to the leading - field current source . at higher frequencies",
    "@xmath40 , the noise of the probe - beam polarimeter can dominate the noise floor ; which is relevant to making measurements with high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the davll also uses a balanced polarimeter to provide an error signal which locks the laser to the atomic resonance .",
    "this signal is dc , so slow drifts in the electronic output of the davll polarimeter can cause slow wavelength fluctuations in the laser , thus creating a time - varying light shift within the vapor .",
    "we are presently investigating this potential source of magnetometer noise but have reason to believe that it is small compared to the noise contributions studied here because the linearly polarized pump beam contributes a negligible systematic shift to the magnetic - resonance frequency @xcite .",
    "other than the two aforementioned circuits the rest of the electronic boxes shown in fig.[fig : setup ] have been selected from commercial instrumentation .      among the different coil",
    "current source topologies that have been analyzed for the experiment , the _ floating - load _ current source shown in fig.[fig : load_loop_noise ] has been selected on the grounds of its slightly lower noise and better thermal performance .",
    "for the analysis , the noise sources that have been identified in the electronics are the input noise of the operational amplifier , the johnson noise and the temperature coefficient ( tc ) in the resistors , as well as thermal dependences of the operational amplifier parameters .",
    "the latter are composed of the thermal drift in the bias current tc(@xmath41 ) , offset current tc(@xmath42 ) and offset voltage tc(@xmath43 ) of the operational amplifier , and they can be neglected since their overall effect is much smaller ( @xmath44 ) than the thermal effect of the resistance ( @xmath45 ) . hence , the overall power spectral density of the current source @xmath46 is approximated as    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the op - amp current and voltage noise spectral density , @xmath50 is the johnson noise component , @xmath51 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath52 is the current source resistance , @xmath11 is the temperature , @xmath53 is the voltage noise of the voltage reference , @xmath54 is the output of the voltage reference , @xmath55 is the tc of the resistors and @xmath56 is the room temperature fluctuations in power spectral density .",

    "support for this work came from project aya2010 - 15709 of the spanish ministry of science and innovation ( micinn ) , esp2013 - 47637-p of the spanish ministry of economy and competitiveness ( mineco ) , and 2009-sgr-935 ( agaur ) .",

    "<S> noise measurements have been carried out in the lisa bandwidth ( 0.1mhz to 100mhz ) to characterize an all - optical atomic magnetometer based on nonlinear magneto - optical rotation . </S>",
    "<S> this was done in order to assess if the technology can be used for space missions with demanding low - frequency requirements like the lisa concept . </S>",
    "<S> magnetometry for low - frequency applications is usually limited by @xmath0 noise and thermal drifts , which become the dominant contributions at sub - millihertz frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic field measurements with atomic magnetometers are not immune to low - frequency fluctuations and significant excess noise may arise due to external elements , such as temperature fluctuations or intrinsic noise in the electronics . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , low - frequency drifts in the applied magnetic field have been identified in order to distinguish their noise contribution from that of the sensor . </S>",
    "<S> we have found the technology suitable for lisa in terms of sensitivity , although further work must be done to characterize the low - frequency noise in a miniaturized setup suitable for space missions .    </S>",
