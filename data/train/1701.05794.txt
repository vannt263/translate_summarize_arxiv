    "content is the following  rings with non - trivial ideal and fields collapse simultaneously \" ,  fields and algebraically closed fields collapse simultaneously \" : if facts can be shown to be contradictory inside the theory of algebraically closed fields , using dynamical proofs , they are contradictory as well inside the theory of non - trivial rings , and the second contradiction can be explicitly constructed from the first one .",
