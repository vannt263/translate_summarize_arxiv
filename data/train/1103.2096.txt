    "<S> ultracold atomic gases have been used extensively in recent years to realize textbook examples of condensed matter phenomena . recently , </S>",
    "<S> phase transitions to ordered structures have been predicted for gases of highly excited , `` frozen '' rydberg atoms . </S>",
    "<S> such rydberg crystals are a model for dilute metallic solids with tunable lattice parameters , and provide access to a wide variety of fundamental phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate theoretically how such structures can be created in four distinct cold atomic systems , by using tailored laser - excitation in the presence of strong rydberg - rydberg interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail the experimental requirements and limitations for these systems , and characterize the basic properties of small crystalline rydberg structures in one , two and three dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction[secintroduction ]    since the development of techniques to cool and trap atomic gases with laser radiation in the 1990 s , it has been possible to realize and study many - body phenomena in dilute , ultracold gases . </S>",
    "<S> some of these phenomena are straight out of solid - state textbooks , such as the mott - hubbard transition @xcite : the transition from a `` conducting '' state to an `` insulator '' state . in optical lattices , which are artificial crystals of light created by standing - wave laser beams , bosonic atoms could be trapped with a filling factor of unity , and a superfluid to mott - insulator transition could be observed </S>",
    "<S> .    one serious shortcoming of such cold atom experiments with regard to the comparison with condensed matter physics is that neutral ground - state atoms interact via short - range van der waals interactions , which are of course much weaker than the coulomb interactions between electrons in solids . </S>",
    "<S> a much closer realization of a strongly - coupled condensed matter system would arise if the atoms could be separated into ions arranged on a lattice , and surrounding electrons that provide the conductance phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> the question then arises how this could be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> ultracold gases can be made strongly - interacting by using feshbach resonances  @xcite , however , it does not mean that the system is automatically strongly - coupled  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these gases are typically very dilute , such that the van der waals range @xmath0 of the ground - state atoms , where @xmath1 is the atomic mass and @xmath2 the van der waals coefficient , is much smaller than the average distance between the particles @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the density . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling parameter @xmath5 that indicates the transition between weakly coupled and strongly - coupled systems , is given by the ratio of interaction energy @xmath6 and kinetic energy @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> even for a unitary fermi gas  @xcite , which is by definition strongly interacting , the coupling parameter is smaller than 1 : @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the fermi energy .    </S>",
    "<S> one way to study strongly interacting and strongly coupled atomic systems is by using ultracold rydberg atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rydberg exitations into electronic @xmath10 states interact , similar as the ground - state atoms , via van der waals interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the van der waals coefficient scales very rapidly with the principal quantum number as @xmath11 , and therefore it is possible to reach the regime @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> robicheaux and hernndez predicted already in 2005 many - body correlations which can rise from the rydberg blockade effect ( also referred to as dipole blockade effect ) in a disordered gas  @xcite , hinting at the possibility of ordered structures . </S>",
    "<S> later , weimer _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  showed that a phase transition could occur from a strongly interacting rydberg gas to a crystalline phase  @xcite , for positive detuning from the ground - state to rydberg transition . since then several proposals have been made to create correlated systems that involve rydberg atoms : for instance by means of dynamical crystallization of rydberg atoms starting from ground - state atoms  @xcite , or by weakly dressing ground - state atoms to form super - solid droplet crystals  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate a very practical scheme which was first proposed by pohl , demler and lukin  @xcite , which allows for a laser - assisted , adiabatic self - assembly of a rydberg atom lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the robustness of a tailored excitation scheme to build up a correlated crystal state from a disordered atomic gas . </S>",
    "<S> although this paper has a theoretical nature , our investigations are based on the present ultracold atom set - up in our group in eindhoven . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment contains also an accelerator infrastructure ( see fig.[fi : exp_setup ] ) , which provides us with a tool to detect correlated rydberg crystal structures .        </S>",
    "<S> the set - up contains a magneto - optical trap for rubidium atoms with appropriate 780 nm trapping lasers . </S>",
    "<S> we routinely trap @xmath13 @xmath14rb atoms at densities up to @xmath15 atoms / m@xmath16 and with temperatures below 1 mk . </S>",
    "<S> both pulsed ( 10 ns yag - pumped dye ) and continuous - wave , single - frequency ( 300 mw solid - state ) 480 nm lasers are present for rydberg excitation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the atom trap is built inside an accelerator , followed by a beam transport system that allows one to create magnified images of both ions and electrons onto a microchannel plate and phosphor screen assembly that is observed with a cooled ccd camera . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration field can be switched on to 10kv / cm on sub nanosecond time scales . </S>",
    "<S> this set - up has been used to study electron and ion beams generated from the laser - cooled atoms by near - threshold photo - ionization and by field - ionization of rydberg atoms . </S>",
    "<S> both ions and electrons can be detected with a multichannel plate as a measure for the total number of rydberg atoms produced . by directly ionizing the sample , and thus creating an ultracold plasma , followed by a rapid extraction of charged particles </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrated that this technique can be used to produce cold bright beams of ions and electrons , with temperatures in the beam of the ions of t=1mk and for the electrons of t=10k  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows : in section [ systemdescription ] we give a theoretical desciption of a cold atomic gas in the frozen gas limit , and the corresponding hamiltonian that describes it . in section [ seccreatingcrystals ] </S>",
    "<S> we argue how rydberg crystals can be created by adiabatically chirping the laser frequency . in section [ secphysicalsystems ] </S>",
    "<S> we look in detail into four distinct cold atomic systems which we consider for creating rydberg lattices . in section [ secperformingchirp ] </S>",
    "<S> we present our results for crystal formation using tailored excitation pulses for one - dimensional systems . in section [ sechigherdimensionalsystems ] </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a few basic crystal properties of two- and three - dimensional systems , and finally we conclude in section [ secconclusions ] .    </S>",
    "<S> system description[systemdescription ] throughout this paper we will be working in the frozen gas limit , where the excitation dynamics happen on a time scale so fast that we can neglect all motion of the atoms @xcite , i.e. ,  ignore their kinetic energy .    </S>",
    "<S> we will investigate four different systems : ( i ) atoms in a deep optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) condensed atoms in a bec , where the thomas - fermi approximation can be made . ( </S>",
    "<S> iii ) thermal atoms in a dipole trap , where temperatures can be in the @xmath17k regime . and </S>",
    "<S> finally , ( iv ) thermal atoms in magneto - optical trap ( mot ) conditions , with temperatures typically in the sub - mk regime .    under all of the above conditions , the frozen gas approximation is satisfied . even for the highest temperatures in the mot , it takes tens of @xmath17s for atoms to move significantly on the crystal scale of @xmath18 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the doppler limit , which gives rise to the temperature of the atoms in the mot , can be expressed as a velocity that is about 0.14 m / s for rubidium . with this velocity , at the time scales of interest of @xmath19s , we can safely assume that the interaction energy between rydberg atoms is constant . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a dephasing mechanism based on doppler broadening due to the thermal motion of the atoms could potentially frustrate lattice formation . </S>",
    "<S> in the following sections , we show how crystal creation relies on adiabatic changing of system parameters . in [ dephasing ] </S>",
    "<S> we verify , in a two - particle picture , that doppler broadening does not affect such dynamics .    in general , </S>",
    "<S> the systems that we describe consist of @xmath20 atoms in a laser field . </S>",
    "<S> we assume an effective laser coupling between the ground state and a particular rydberg state , such that we can describe each atom as a two level system . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20-body excitation state can then be represented by basis states of the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a @xmath20-dimensional vector with elements @xmath23 , indicating whether the @xmath24-th atom is in the ground ( 0 ) or excited ( 1 ) state . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the special situation in which the @xmath20 atoms are localised at fixed positions . </S>",
    "<S> we will shortly show how this picture can be applied to more general systems . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the @xmath20 atoms are denoted with the @xmath25 vector @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the position of the @xmath24-th atom . in the rotating frame , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian governing the dynamics of the excitation state vectors @xmath21 of the atoms is given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 counts whether the @xmath24-th atom is excited , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 change the state of the @xmath24-th atom . </S>",
    "<S> the first two terms in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqh ] ) describe the atom - laser interaction , with @xmath32 the laser detuning and @xmath33 the effective rabi frequency of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the third term equals the van der waals interaction between atoms in the rydberg state .    in practice </S>",
    "<S> there are often many individual atoms spaced so closely together , that we can safely say that within a certain group of atoms there will never be more than one excitation due to the rydberg blockade . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can not ( e.g.  because of detection resolution ) , or need not , distinguish which particular atom carries an excitation . </S>",
    "<S> such groups of atoms can be said to coherently share an excitation , and are commonly called superatoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can partition the space into @xmath34 volumes @xmath35 , @xmath36 , each of which contains a group of @xmath37 atoms which together represent the @xmath38-th superatom . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ eqh ] ) can be equivalently applied to describe superatoms instead of single atoms , where the positions @xmath39 are taken to be weighted averages of atomic positions within a superatom , and the rabi frequency @xmath33 is replaced by a collective rabi frequency @xmath40 for the @xmath38-th superatom @xcite : @xmath41 this collective rabi frequency reflects the fact that there are multiple atoms in a superatom , and that the superatom as a whole is more susceptible to the laser light . </S>",
    "<S> this latter fact becomes important later on , once we consider dense , inhomogeneous systems . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ secperformingchirp ] we shall perform simulations of the @xmath20-body system and superatoms will prove to be a useful means for reducing the size of the hilbert space under consideration .    </S>",
    "<S> having introduced the hamiltonian for a collection of particles localised at fixed positions , it is now time to turn our attention to more general systems such as bose - einstein condensates with fully coherent wavefunctions , or statistical mixtures found in thermal clouds . to this end , we expand the hilbert space @xmath42 of excitation configurations @xmath21 , with the hilbert space of @xmath20-body spatial wave functions @xmath43 , to form the total product hilbert space @xmath44 .    a convenient basis for this statespace is given by states @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the state with all @xmath20 particles localised at positions specified by the @xmath47-dimensional vector @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian operator ( [ eqh ] ) is straightforwardly extended to the total hilbert space : @xmath48 it is in this final step where the frozen gas approximation becomes apparent : in absence of kinetic energy , the hamiltonian @xmath49 is diagonal in the spatial components .    using the basis states ( [ eqbasis ] ) , and assuming that all particles start in the ground state @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> , we can write the general state of the system at @xmath51 as @xmath52 when @xmath53 , this state starts to evolve under the action of the hamiltonian ( [ eqhtotal ] ) , written down formally with the time evolution operator @xmath54 : @xmath55 the frozen gas hamiltonian ( [ eqhtotal ] ) however can not make transitions between states with different spatial parts @xmath56 , with @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the time evolution operator of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqpsit ] ) will only affect the excitation part @xmath21 of the many - particle state @xmath58 , and not the spatial part @xmath46 , so that we can write @xmath59 here , the time evolution operator @xmath60 governs the excitation state of all the particles under the action of the hamiltonian ( [ eqh ] ) , given the fact that they are pinned at definite locations @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the general time - dependent state in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqpsit ] ) can then be written as @xmath61 where we have defined excitation state vectors @xmath62 that describe the excitation state of a given atomic configuration @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the frozen gas hamiltonian ( [ eqhtotal ] ) only affects the excitation part @xmath63 , which thus carries the time dependence whereas the spatial part @xmath46 remains `` frozen '' . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that @xmath64 and @xmath65 thus satisfy separate normalisation conditions given by @xmath66 from the above discussion , we can conclude that the time evolution of a system in the state ( [ eqpsi0 ] ) can be broken down into the time evolution of the individual , position basis components @xmath46 that make up the total state . </S>",
    "<S> each such component evolves completely independent from the others as a result of the diagonality of the hamiltonian ( [ eqhtotal ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> expectation values of observables of interest , @xmath67 , that are independent of momentum , such as the excitation density , are computed for each of the individual time evolved configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the results are combined in an incoherent sum , in which the coefficients @xmath64 only appear in terms of their modulus squared : @xmath68 similarly , expectation values of observables in statistical mixtures , such as thermal clouds in a trap , are also computed using incoherent sums over individual time - evolved configurations . here , </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath69 in eq . ( [ eqobs ] ) </S>",
    "<S> are replaced by the statistical probabilities of finding a particular atomic configuration @xmath26 . in the remainder of this paper </S>",
    "<S> we shall therefore employ eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqobs ] ) for both coherent states as well as thermal clouds , with the understanding that the @xmath69 coefficients are statistical probabilities in the latter case .    </S>",
    "<S> adiabatically creating rydberg crystals[seccreatingcrystals ] in the previous section we have argued how the time evolution of the many - particle state can be broken down into the time evolution of the individual , position - basis states @xmath70 that make up the total state @xmath71 of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqpsisuper ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> to see how a crystal state can adiabatically evolve in the frozen gas limit , we now single out a particular component configuration @xmath46 of the atoms , and analyse the time evolution of the corresponding excitation state @xmath63 . </S>",

    "<S> are eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ eqh ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy @xmath73 of each state @xmath21 assumes a simple linear dependence on the detuning : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the total number of excited atoms in the state @xmath21 , and @xmath76 is the total interaction energy between the excited atoms in this particular configuration . clearly , the energies of all states with the same number of excited atoms have the same slope as function of the detuning @xmath32 </S>",

    "<S> the basic ingredients for such a chirp are as follows .    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> start by switching on the laser and increase the coupling strength @xmath33 from zero up to some final value . </S>",
    "<S> this is done at a large , negative detuning with all particles starting in their atomic ground state , coinciding with the many body ground state . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> once the coupling @xmath33 is sufficiently high , the detuning can be increased from its initial value towards its final target value @xmath141 between @xmath99 and @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   switch off the laser , by lowering the coupling strength back to @xmath81 again .    </S>",
    "<S> the above three steps should be carried out as adiabatically as possible , yielding a crystal state at the end of the chirp , such as depicted in the insets of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figdmindmax ] . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ figsimresults1 ] , panels ( a ) , we show various typical chirps , modified by a computer algorithm to maximise adiabaticity given a constrained time frame of @xmath142 in which it is to be carried out . </S>",
    "<S> each chirp is tailor made for a specific system . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figsimresults1 ] will be discussed in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ secresults ] .    starting with step _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ of the chirp , the first feature to be noted is the shape of @xmath143 in the first section , which is roughly exponential . as the coupling is still small , </S>",
    "<S> the energy levels are closely spaced together , and only small changes to the hamiltonian can be made without making transitions to excited states . when the coupling is stronger , the ground state gets pushed to lower energies and separates further from the other energies , and as a consequence we can make larger changes to the hamiltonian and increase the rate of change of the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> as the final value is reached , the ramp abruptly stops and @xmath33 remains constant . since the schrdinger equation is a first order differential equation in time , such sharp changes in slope do not affect adiabaticity and there is no need to smoothen the chirp .    </S>",
    "<S> when in the second step the detuning is increased , we found that the maximum slope varies non - monotonically throughout the chirp . </S>",
    "<S> regions where the detuning can only be changed relatively slowly are not necessarily correlated to the critical detunings @xmath144 described in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ secphysicalsystems ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is a sign of a complicated underlying energy landscape , whose details are beyond the scope of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the most critical step of the chirp is the final step , switching off the laser and lowering @xmath33 back to zero again . </S>",
    "<S> when the detuning is large and positive , the energy scales in the system become larger , such that the coupling strength becomes relatively smaller . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the case of a non - uniform density , such as the odt or bec , the @xmath145 enhancement of the coupling in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ superatomomega ] ) necessitates a very fine control over the final stages of switching off the coupling , as even small intensities can still couple strongly to the central , high density region of the excitation volume . </S>",
    "<S> because of these two phenomena , step @xmath146 takes up by far the greatest amount of time of the total crystal creation procedure . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the time scale for switching off the laser is an order of magnitude larger than the combined time for switching it on and chirping the detuning . </S>",
    "<S> again it should be noted that the rate of change in @xmath33 varies , as another sign of a complicated underlying energy landscape . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that it is favourable to _ decrease _ the detuning slightly while ramping down the intensity .    simulating excitation dynamics we now have all the necessary ingredients to perform a realistic chirp and simulate an attempt to create a rydberg crystal in each of the four systems described in sec . </S>",

    "<S> we aim to create 5 or 6 excitations in total , due to limitations imposed by the computational complexity .    following the ideas outlined in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ systemdescription ] , the simulation can be broken down into two parts . </S>",
    "<S> the first part consists of simulating the time evolution of the excitation dynamics of a given set of atoms at fixed positions . </S>",

    "<S> we assume @xmath147 particles in the excitation volume , whereas in the case of the bec and the odt we assume @xmath148 atoms in the excitation volume , and @xmath135 in that of the mot . </S>",
    "<S> since the parameter space for @xmath20 two level systems scales as @xmath149 , we need to make some approximations to make the simulations tractable . </S>",
    "<S> the first approximation consists of reducing the @xmath150 atoms in the odt and bec to @xmath151 superatoms , by employing the algorithm suggested in ref . </S>",

    "<S> but even the resulting @xmath153 states space is too large to handle , and we reduce the number of states further following the suggestions put forth in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where we omit all states with more than a certain maximum number of excitations ( @xmath154 in our case ) , and also omit all states where the excitations are spaced too close together . </S>",
    "<S> this latter approximation is made under the assumption that these states will never be significantly populated due to the rydberg blockade . </S>",

    "<S> [ figsimresults1 ] show clearly what happens during the three steps of the chirp . </S>",
    "<S> when the laser is switched on in the first step , the initial state @xmath173 with all atoms in the ground state becomes a superposition of states with @xmath164 or @xmath92 excitations . </S>",
    "<S> then , as the detuning is increased while the intensity is at its maximum , states with higher numbers of excitations start to mix into the system state . </S>",
    "<S> no particular number of excitations has a high probability of occurring ( panel ( b ) ) , and the location of the excitations is also spread out across the excitation volume ( panel ( c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> only when in the final step the laser is switched off do the excitations localise at regularly spaced positions , and the rydberg crystal takes shape . </S>",
    "<S> first , the outermost excitations localise , and then excitations crystallise progressively inwards towards the center of the excitation volume . in panel ( i.c ) for the excitation density of the optical lattice , one can distinguish the individual atoms at each lattice site , and see how the excitations are initially shared among all atoms and crystallise only at the end of the chirp .    </S>",
    "<S> the middle section of the chirp takes the shortest time in the systems with high particle numbers , the bec ( ii ) and the odt ( iii ) , as a result of the enhanced @xmath145 coupling in the superatom picture [ see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ superatomomega ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of this enhanced coupling is also clearly visible in panels ( a ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figsimresults1 ] for systems ( ii ) and ( iii ) , where a disproportionally long time is needed to ramp down the last few percents of laser intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the center panels ( b ) show that in this long flat tail of the intensity chirp there are still large changes in the excitation number probabilities .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figsimresults2 ] shows the excitation density ( [ eqexcdens ] ) at the end of the chirp ( column ( a ) ) , and correlation function ( [ eqg2 ] ) at the end of the chirp ( column ( b ) ) , for each of the four systems ( i ) - ( iv ) of interest .    starting with the excitation density in the optical lattice in the top left panel ( a.i ) , we see that the excitations are more or less perfectly localised on individual lattice sites . upon close inspection </S>",
    "<S> there are small probabilities discernable , for finding the excitation at neighbouring lattice sites , indicating that the time evolution has not been perfectly adiabatic . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation density of the bec in panel ( a.ii ) also exhibits distinct and well - separated peaks . </S>",
    "<S> however , the excitation density of the thermal cloud in an odt in panel ( a.iii ) shows peaks that , although clearly visible , are not entirely separated spatially . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the boundaries of the excitation volume not being as sharply defined as those of the bec . in the odt , </S>",
    "<S> the spread in the position of the outermost particles is largest of all four systems . </S>",
    "<S> even the mot excitation density in panel ( a.iv ) shows better separated peaks . due to the sharp boundary of the excitation volume in this system ( see sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ secphysicalsystems ] ) the peaks show a roughly similar shape to those of the bec . </S>",
    "<S> however , they exhibit a larger spread around their mean positions , reflecting the much lower number ( @xmath135 ) of particles present in the excitation volume . in effect </S>",
    "<S> , the low particle number offers fewer positions for the excitations to localise on , and the optimal positions leading to the lowest energies are often not occupied in a particular monte carlo simulation .    finally , moving to column ( b ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figsimresults2 ] , showing the correlation function for each system , we can extract the following information . interpreting the correlation functions @xmath169 as histograms for the distances between pairs of excitations </S>",
    "<S> , we clearly see that there are never two excitations within one peak of the excitation densities in column ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> should this have been the case , then we would find nonzero probabilities at distances smaller than the inter - peak distance of @xmath174 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first peak in @xmath169 appearing around @xmath175 is the distribution of pair separations of excitations in _ neighbouring _ peaks in the excitation density . </S>",
    "<S> likewise the second peak in @xmath169 is the distribution of pairs in peaks separated by a single other peak , followed by the pair distributions of excitations in peaks separated by two peaks , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the height of the peaks in the correlation function @xmath169 directly reflects the number of pairs of peaks separated by @xmath176 other peaks , leading to a linear decay in height . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the peaks signifies how regularly the excitations are spaced . </S>",
    "<S> again , in case ( iii ) of the odt the peaks are the least sharply defined , as a direct result of the excitation volume not being bounded sharply . in case ( i ) , the optical lattice , there are small sub - peaks visible again , which are correlations between the large peaks and sub - peaks of the excitation density in panel ( a.i ) .    higher dimensional systems[sechigherdimensionalsystems ]    . initially , when there are few rydberg atoms , all excitations reside on the boundary of the excitation volume in order to maximise the interparticle distance . </S>",
    "<S> as the number of rydberg atoms confined in the circular volume increases , the inner region of the excitation volume starts to fill as well . at @xmath177 the first particle appears in the center , followed at @xmath178 and @xmath179 by a second and third one respectively . at @xmath180 , </S>",
    "<S> an additional shell starts to form at the center , progressively filling up ( @xmath181 , .. ) until there are so many particles in the interior that boundary effects become negligible and a transition to bulk behaviour is observed , where a hexagonal lattice is formed in the central region ( @xmath182 and @xmath183 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding energies of these configurations are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fit2d3d](a).,width=302 ]    in the previous section , we focused in detail on the adiabatic creation of one - dimensional rydberg crystals . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dimensionality of the crystal structures can be controlled by the shape of the volume set up by the excitation lasers . as 1d structures are produced by a needle - shaped light field , so can 2d structures be created by a sheet of light intersecting the atomic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> 3d structures can arise in a light volume where excitations are not prohibited by dimensional restrictions . in this section </S>",
    "<S> we take a closer look at what type of 2d and 3d structures may arise when applying the same type of laser excitation techniques in 2d and 3d light volumes , and investigate the energy of the ground states as function of the number of rydberg atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this latter quantity is of importance when determining the critical detunings @xmath96 described in sec [ secphysicalsystems ] at which the system transitions from an @xmath1-excitation ground state to an @xmath97-excitation ground state .        while in the 1d case the crystal structures are basically similar to regularly spaced chains of rydberg excitations , in higher dimensions the structures can be quite complicated </S>",
    "<S> however , for simplicity , we assume that the crystal structures with @xmath1 excitations are confined by a circular plane ( 2d ) or spherical volume ( 3d ) , which have hard wall boundaries and where the interior can be considered as homogeneous with no external potential .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the optimal crystal structures by using a conjugate gradients @xcite minimization of the energy of @xmath1 point particles interacting via a repulsive two - body van der waals @xmath184 potential : @xmath185 the minimization is performed with respect to the particle positions @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> since this energy represents a very complex @xmath186 ( 2d ) or @xmath187 ( 3d ) dimensional energy landscape , with many local minima , we have performed hundreds of minimizations for each rydberg particle number @xmath1 with random initial conditions , and recorded the lowest energy configuration thus found as a good approximation for the global minimum . </S>",
    "<S> there exists a large body of literature in the field of coulomb crystals where similar procedures are found to find crystal structures of trapped ions , see e.g. refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and references therein .     and [ fig3d ] . when the number of atoms is increased , additional shells appear ( blue / red fuzzy lines ) that move toward greater radial distance to make room for yet more inner shells . </S>",
    "<S> a large part of the atoms resides on the boundary of the system , corresponding to the bright line at radial distance @xmath188 . in the 2d system </S>",
    "<S> , the onset of lattice formation and breakdown of shell structure can be observed near @xmath189 for high atom numbers where the shell structure becomes more diffuse . ]    in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2d ] and [ fig3d ] examples can be seen of crystal structures of rydberg excitations , for a given number of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> typically , we observe in @xmath190 that at low particle numbers @xmath1 all particles are located on the boundary of the volume , maximizing the distances between the nearest neighbours . as @xmath1 is increased the boundary fills up , until at a certain point it becomes energetically favourable for the new particle to be placed in the center of the volume . </S>",
    "<S> as the particle number is increased further , more particles will be located near the center , forming a ring shaped structure . </S>",
    "<S> this process continues until , in turn , a particle appears in the center of this ring again , starting the cycle anew . for even larger particle numbers , there are so many particles located in the interior that boundary effects become negligible and the particles assume a hexagonal lattice structure typical of bulk behaviour </S>",
    "<S> .    generally speaking , for larger numbers of excited atoms a competition occurs between lattice structures in the interior , and shell structures near the boundaries of the system , an effect familiar from coulomb crystal studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> positions on the boundary of the system are energetically favourable due to the ( partial ) absence of neighboring atoms , leading to boundary effects ( shell structures ) , propagating inward until the boundary is sufficiently far away such that bulk behavior ( lattice structures ) start to dominate . for a sufficiently large number of rydberg atoms , the structure can then be regarded as a ( quasi ) periodic , homogeneous lattice . however , for small atom numbers we enter the regime of mesoscopic physics , where we create symmetric few - body clusters .    in @xmath191 systems we see the same chain of events , with consecutive shells forming when the particle number is increased . here </S>",
    "<S> , we expect lattice formation in the interior only at much higher rydberg atom numbers since surfaces of spheres can accomodate much more particles than the circular boundary in the @xmath190 case . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that up to @xmath192 we still see distinct shell structures in @xmath191 .    as a function of the number of rydberg atoms in the lattice , we show in fig .  </S>",
