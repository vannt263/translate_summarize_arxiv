    "[ introduction ]    the meson production reaction in nucleon - nucleon collisions near threshold has the potential to yield information on hadron properties  @xcite and also plays an important role for exploring the baryon spectroscopy  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the experimental database on the reaction of @xmath11 near threshold has been expanded significantly .",
    "in addition to the measurements of the @xmath12 total and differential cross sections , below the threshold of the production of the @xmath1 meson , performed experimentally with cosy-11  @xcite and anke  @xcite detectors at the cooler synchrotron cosy in germany , there are invariant mass distributions of various subsystems obtained at excess energies @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 mev  @xcite and in dalitz plots  @xcite",
    ". the total and differential cross sections are also available for the @xmath16 reaction above the @xmath1 meson threshold determined by the anke  @xcite collaboration and the disto  @xcite collaboration .    in response to this wealth of data",
    "there have been theoretical investigations for the @xmath17 reaction above @xmath1 meson production  @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical investigations of this reaction below the @xmath1 meson threshold are scarce . below the @xmath1 meson threshold",
    ", the main contribution to the production of @xmath6 pair could be through the scalar mesons @xmath8 and @xmath7 , thus , the original motivation for the study of the @xmath17 reaction near threshold was to investigate the enigmatic properties of the scalar resonances @xmath8 and @xmath7  @xcite .    unlike the production of the @xmath1 meson above threshold , in the low energy region we do not need to separate the non@xmath18 from the @xmath1 contribution , and the fact that the data were spread over a wide range of @xmath6 invariant masses gives a special advantage to investigation of the scalar mesons @xmath8 and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "these two mesons , which have been studied by a large number of theoretical works , are commonly explained as conventional @xmath19 mesons in the constituent quark model  @xcite , tetraquark states by jaffe  @xcite , and @xmath20 molecules  @xcite . besides",
    ", within the chiral unitary approach , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 scalar mesons are dynamically generated from the interaction of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 treated as coupled channels in @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "both couple strongly to the @xmath20 channel .",
    "inspired by those results obtained from the chiral unitary approach , for the @xmath25 reaction , we take the final state interaction ( fsi ) between @xmath26 and @xmath27 into account by using the techniques of the chiral unitary approach as in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this sense",
    "the contributions from scalar mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 occur through the @xmath9 fsi .",
    "this approach has been used in the investigation of the fsi of mesons in different processes in order to get a better understanding of the nature of the meson resonances as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite    it has been suggested that the @xmath4 could play an essential role on the kaon pair production through the @xmath28 process  @xcite and this process seems more important than the contributions from the scalar mesons  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the role played by the @xmath4 state is crucial for reproducing the @xmath29 mass distribution  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reaction of @xmath17 has been studied by assuming that the @xmath29 final state originates from the decay of the @xmath4 , where the @xmath30 resonance acts as a doorway state for the production of @xmath4 . however , the model calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite underestimate the total cross sections of the @xmath17 reaction near the kinematical threshold ( see fig .",
    "4 of ref .",
    "so , in the present work , within the effective lagrangian approach , we restudy the @xmath17 reaction below the threshold of the @xmath1 meson production by considering the contribution from the nucleon pole . additionally , different forms of the couplings ( pseudoscalar and pseudovector ) for the @xmath31 interaction and different strength for the proton - proton fsi are also investigated .",
    "in the next section , we will present the formalism and ingredients necessary for our estimations , then numerical results and discussions are given in sec .",
    "finally , a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "[ formalism ]        we study the @xmath17 reaction below the threshold of the production of the @xmath1 meson within an effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the basic feynman diagrams for this process are depicted in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] , where we pay attention to the contribution from the nucleon pole for the production of the @xmath32 pair and @xmath33 pair , while the @xmath29 pair is produced by the decay of the off - shell @xmath3 and the subthreshold @xmath4 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "because of the large @xmath31 coupling and the small pion mass , the underlying mechanism will be dominated by the @xmath35 exchange .",
    "thus , the contributions from the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 exchanges are neglected in the present calculation .    to compute the amplitudes of these diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] , we need the effective lagrangian densities for the interaction vertexes .",
    "there are two forms for @xmath31 interaction commonly employed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "one is the pseudoscalar ( ps ) coupling , @xmath39 and the other one is the pseudovector ( pv ) coupling , @xmath40    following the su(3 ) flavor symmetry , the @xmath41 interaction lagrangian densities are similar to the @xmath31 interaction , @xmath42 @xmath43    in addition , the effective @xmath44 coupling is also needed  @xcite , @xmath45    the coupling constants in the above lagrangian densities are taken as  @xcite : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .    on the other hand ,",
    "we need to include the form factors because the hadrons are not point - like particles .",
    "we adopt here the common scheme used in many previous works . in our calculation , for the @xmath10 vertex , we take the form following that used in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the four - momentum , mass , and cut - off parameter for the exchanged pion meson , respectively . for the cut - off parameter @xmath52 , we take the value of @xmath53 gev  @xcite .",
    "the form factors for the off - shell nucleon , and the hyperon @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are taken in the form advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the four - momentum and the mass of the exchanged hadron , respectively . in the present calculation ,",
    "to minimize the number of free parameters , we use the same cut - off parameters for those hadrons for simplicity , @xmath57 ,",
    "the value of the cut off parameter will be discussed in the following .",
    "then , according to the feynman rules , the scattering amplitudes for the @xmath59 reaction can be obtained straightforwardly with the above effective couplings . here , we give explicitly the amplitude of fig .  [ diagram ] ( a ) with @xmath3 exchange and in the case of ps coupling for @xmath31 and @xmath60 vertexes as an example , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent respectively the spin projection and four - momentum of the initial or final protons ; @xmath64 [ @xmath65 is the propagator for the exchanged @xmath66 meson [ nucleon ] .",

    "in addition , the propagator of the @xmath4 resonance is written in a breit - wigner form  @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the energy - dependent total width of the @xmath74 resonance , which can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath75 with @xmath76 @xmath77    according to fig .",

    "we choose five channels @xmath6 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 which are denoted from 1 to 5 , to calculate the amplitude @xmath85 in the charge eigenstates directly .",

    "the loop integration variable is regularized with a cutoff @xmath94 and @xmath95 = 1030 mev as used in refs .  @xcite . with this value ,",
    "the scalar mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 were dynamically generated as poles of the @xmath87-wave amplitudes .",
    "thus , in the present case , the contributions from scalar mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 occur via the fsi between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    for the fsi of the proton and proton in the final state",

    "the factor @xmath117 before the @xmath118 function comes from the two identical protons in the final state , while the flux factor @xmath119 in the above equation is @xmath120    since the relative phase between @xmath3 and @xmath4 exchanges is not known , the interference terms between these parts could be small and are ignored in our concrete calculation .",
    "with the formalism and ingredients given above , the total cross section versus excess energy @xmath121 for the @xmath17 reaction is calculated by using a monte carlo multi - particle phase space integration program .",

    "[ tcsa ] . in our calculation , we take two types ( ps and pv ) of @xmath31 and @xmath41 couplings , and two sets of proton - proton fsi parameters . therefore , there are a total of four combinations as shown in tab .",

    "the experimental data are taken from refs .",
    "the solid , dashed , dotted , and dot - dashed curves stand for the results obtained with the parameters of sets i , ii , iii , and iv , respectively . ]    however , the contributions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are different between ps and pv couplings .",
    "these results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ tcsb ] , where the dashed and dotted lines stand for contributions from @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the results shown in individual panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) are obtained with set i , ii , iii , and iv .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath3 hyperon plays a dominant role in the case of ps coupling , while the @xmath4 also has a significant contribution .",
    "in contrast , in the case of pv coupling , the @xmath4 contribution is predominant while the @xmath3 hyperon contribution is rather small and can be neglected .",
    "since we only pay attention to the @xmath17 reaction below the threshold of the production of the @xmath1 meson and also near the @xmath4 threshold , it is expected that @xmath4 would play an important role in this energy region  @xcite .",
    "although the ps coupling can also reproduce the total cross section data , it seems that the pv coupling is more favored . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pv coupling is more general than the ps coupling . besides , it is also shown that , for the @xmath124 reaction , the effect of the @xmath5 fsi on the toal cross section can be adjusted by modifying the cut off parameters in the form factors of the intermediate proton and @xmath3 .          to show the effect from the @xmath6 fsi",
    ", we give the results for the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath17 reaction at an excess energy @xmath121 = 23.9 mev in fig .",
    "[ kk239 ] , where panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) stand for the results obtained with the parameters of sets i , ii , iii and , iv , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ kk239 ] , the dashed lines are pure phase space distributions , while the solid lines are full calculations from our model . by comparing our theoretical results with the experimental data , we found that the @xmath6 fsi employed within a chiral unitary approach plays an essential role in describing the line shape of the @xmath6 .",
    "the peak near the @xmath6 threshold can be well reproduced by including the @xmath6 fsi with the techniques of the chiral unitary approach , where the scalar mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 were dynamically generated . in this sense , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons play an important role in the @xmath125 reaction below the threshold of the production of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath5 fsi can also slightly influence the @xmath6 invariant mass distribution .",
    "here , we find again that the ps and pv couplings are both good enough to reproduce the experimental data , and the effects of @xmath5 fsi on the differential cross sections can also be adjusted by the cut off parameters .            finally , in figs .",
    "[ kk10 ] and [ kk28 ] , with the parameters of set iii , we give our model predictions of the differential cross sections for the @xmath17 reaction at excess energies @xmath121 = 10 and @xmath121 = 28 mev together with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that our theoretical calculations can reasonably describe the experimental data at both excess energies @xmath121 = 10 and @xmath121 = 28 mev , especially for the @xmath6 and @xmath5 invariant mass distributions , which is because we have included both the @xmath6 fsi and the @xmath5 fsi .    from fig .",
    "[ kk28 ] , one can see that , although we have considered the contributions from the @xmath4 state , we still can not well reproduce the invariant @xmath2 mass distribution .",
    "this indicates the strong @xmath2 fsi . in ref .",

    "it is shown that the kaon - exchange term , which is mostly dominated by the high energy @xmath4 pole , is crucial to produce the line shape of the @xmath131 [ @xmath132 .",
    "thus , the kaon - exchange mechanism should be also important in the present case , especially for producing the line shape of the @xmath2 .",
    "however , our model can give a reasonable description of the experimental data on the total cross section and most differential cross sections in the considered energy region .",
    "meanwhile , our calculation offers some important clues for the mechanisms of the @xmath12 reaction and makes a first effort to study the @xmath6 fsi with the chiral unitary approach .",
    "hence , we will leave the issue of the strong @xmath133 fsi to further studies .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the @xmath17 reaction within an effective lagrangian model . with the assumption that the kaon pair production is mainly through the nucleon pole , @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ", our calculation can reproduce the total cross section at the energy region below the threshold of the production of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "we adopted the pseudoscalar and pseudovector couplings for the @xmath10 interaction .",
    "it is found that both pseudoscalar and pseudovector couplings can describe the experimental data , but , the @xmath3 plays an important role in the case of the ps coupling , while the @xmath4 contribution is predominant for the pv coupling .",

    "in addition to the @xmath5 fsi using the jost function , the @xmath6 fsi is also studied with the chiral unitary approach , where the scalar mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 were dynamically generated as poles of the @xmath87-wave amplitudes . in this sense",
    "the role of mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 are played through the @xmath9 fsi . after taking the @xmath5 and @xmath6 fsi into account ,",
    "the experimental data on the invariant mass distributions of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 are well reproduced at an excess energy @xmath121 = 23.9 mev .",
    "besides , it can also be seen that the contribution from the isospin zero channel is much stronger than the isospin one channel in the @xmath134 process in a chiral unitary approach  @xcite , which agrees with the experiment data analysis given by ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the fsi of the four body @xmath135 is extremely complex .",
    "nevertheless , taking the @xmath5 and @xmath6 fsi into account , the energy dependence of the total cross sections below the threshold of the production of the @xmath1 meson can be well reproduced by considering the contributions from the nucleon pole , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "however , the strong @xmath2 fsi is still required to study by further theoretical works because it always connected with the controversial @xmath4 state .",

    "<S> nucleon pole contribution in the @xmath0 reaction below the threshold of the production of the @xmath1 meson is studied within the effective lagrangian approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that the @xmath2 final state originates from the decay of the hyperons @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the @xmath5 final state interaction ( fsi ) parametrized using the jost function , we have also considered the @xmath6 fsi with the techniques of the chiral unitary approach , where the scalar mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 were dynamically generated . hence , the contributions from scalar mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 occur through the @xmath9 fsi . it is shown that the available experimental data are well reproduced , especially the total cross sections and the invariant mass distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , different forms of the couplings ( pseudoscalar and pseudovector ) for the @xmath10 interaction and different strengths for the proton - proton fsi are also investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the contributions from hyperon @xmath3 and @xmath4 are different between these two kinds of couplings . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the proton - proton fsi can be adjusted by the cut off parameters used in the form factors . </S>"
