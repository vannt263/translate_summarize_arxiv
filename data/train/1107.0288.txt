    "topological quantum computation requires the existence of topologically ordered states whose low energy excitations follow non - abelian statistics .",
    "the subspace of states corresponding to a fixed number of quasiparticles is degenerate , to an exponential precision , in the separation between quasiparticles , and an exchange of the positions of these anyonic excitations , also known as braiding , leads to a unitary transformation within this low energy subspace .",
    "these unitary operations are insensitive to the exact path used to perform the braiding operation and in many cases , for an appropriate encoding , braiding operations correspond to `` standard '' one- and two - qubit gates within the low energy subspace .",
    "these operations can be used as building blocks for fault tolerant quantum computation .",
    "there are many candidate systems for experimental realizations of topological phases of matter with these properties .",

    "spin - triplet @xmath1 pairing superfluidity occurs in the a - phase of @xmath2 @xcite and in strontium ruthenates @xcite , in which half quantum vortices would be non - abelian @xcite .",
    "there are also proposals to realize chiral p - wave superconductors in ultra - cold atom systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore there have been many advances towards producing topological states of matter in layered heterojunction systems @xcite .",
    "virtually all current experimentally viable proposals for platforms for topological quantum computation only support ising type anyons which are carried by majorana fermion modes . colloquially speaking these fermions are half of a regular fermion .",
    "more precisely they are self - adjoint operators @xmath3 which can be written as a sum of an annihilation and creation operator for one fermion mode and which satisfy the algebra : @xmath4 any two majorana fermion operators can be combined into a regular fermion mode @xmath5 and its adjoint @xmath6 via @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    the topological qubit is made up of four spin polarized mbss @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these can be combined into two sets of creation and annihilation operators:@xmath11 for the logical basis it is convenient to work in the even fermion parity subspace . the qubit basis can be chosen to be @xmath12 and @xmath13 where the @xmath14 s and @xmath15 s refer to the occupation numbers relative to the complex fermion operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : operators ] ) . because of fermion parity conservation , any operation that does not entangle the states with the environment can not mix even and odd fermion parity states for the qubits . as such",
    ", all gates acting on the topological qubit should not take the system out of the logical subspace .",
    "furthermore all the operators of the single spin clifford group may be produced by braiding the four vortices of our qubit leading to potentially topologically protected gates @xcite .",
    "in particular the various single qubit operations in our logic basis may be conveniently written in terms of the majorana operators . for future use",
    "we note that in this encoding @xmath16 here all the sigma matrices are with respect to the logic basis @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ". we will primarily be interested in correlators of the form @xmath19 .",
    "we will proceed to calculate these below .",
    "the majorana operators are zero modes of some mean field hamiltonian @xmath20=0 $ ] so it can be argued that these modes are protected from decoherence as the mean field hamiltonian when restricted to the subspace generated by these modes is zero .",
    "one of the open tasks of topological quantum computation is associated with understanding the extent of this protection .",
    "this is the subject of this paper .",
    "in this section we outline the setup of the rest of the paper .",
    "we present the relevant hamiltonian and discuss its basic properties .",
    "we describe the type of qubit we will focus on in the text , a localized majorana mode , and give an overview of some other encodings we shall not consider in this paper . we describe the kinds of calculations of memory coherence we are going to do in this paper .",
    "we also give a section by section outline .",
    "we begin our discussion with relevant hamiltonians .",

    "( [ eq : tunnelinghamiltonian ] ) .",
    "furthermore the fermions in the bath will always be assumed to be gapped , for example , electrons in an insulating or superconducting material ( environments composed of gapless fermions , instead , would obviously lead to decoherence ) .",
    "there are many examples of microscopic situations where hamiltonians of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tunnelinghamiltonian ] ) arise , one is as follows .",
    "if one writes the mode expansion of the electron creation and annihilation operators in the ( superconducting ) system of interest , one finds that : @xmath25 here @xmath26 stands for the eigenoperators of the bdg equations , with non - zero energies , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the components of the corresponding eigenmode of the bdg equations .",
    "@xmath29 is the majorana fermion corresponding to the zero energy mode .",
    "now consider an insulating substrate below a system which may be described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : decopositionfield - intro ] ) above .",
    "a concrete example is given by the bulk of a topological insulator in tunneling contact with a superconductor as shown in ref .  .",
    "for a static hamiltonian the bulk and surface states are orthogonalized , but dynamical effects such as phonons or two - level defect systems can alter the original hamiltonian and turn on a hybridization .",
    "this perturbation takes the form of a tunneling between the electrons : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 controls the amplitude of fluctuations of the tunneling coupling .",
    "@xmath31 can be due to phonons , two - level systems , or even classical sources of noise .",
    "the electrons @xmath32 come from the insulating ( gapped ) system , which comprise the fermionic component of our bath .",
    "this illustrates one of the many ways to arrive at hamiltonians of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : tunnelinghamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the coupling hamiltonian that is derived in the paragraph above is local .",
    "the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tunnelinghamiltonian ] ) are local and couple to only one majorana mode , with no long distance coupling between the modes of any form . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on sets of baths that couple to each majorana individually .",
    "we would like to stress now and henceforth that even by coupling to individual modes , one at a time ( with no cross mode coupling ) , the bath can be very damaging , in many cases leading to zero coherence for long times .",
    "below , we look at decoherence by analyzing qubit correlations such as @xmath19 , which , as we show in this paper , factorizes when the baths that couple to each majorana are uncorrelated with one another : @xmath33 thus , even though the qubit is defined non - locally using spatially separated majorana fermions , below we will show that the decay of the memory is controlled by the product of the two - time correlations of the separate majorana modes .",
    "it then suffices to understand the effect of the bath on each majorana fermion separately .    at this point",
    "its worthwhile to stress that the qubit encoding given above is not unique .",
    "a particularly interesting example of a different encoding , given by akhmerov  @xcite , is a fermion parity protected encoding .",
    "there , the qubit is made from fermion parity preserving operators : @xmath34 that commute with both the tunneling hamiltonian and the hamiltonian for the environment . here",

    "mid gap carroli matricon degennes states in vortex cores , this compound qubit is very efficient",
    ". however we stress that , in the presence of a bath ( say made by continuum states ) , the construction of an operator that is protected because of parity conservation requires a product of infinitely many operators : which is not practical or easily experimentally measurable .",
    "one could also truncate the product so as to account for a system , and the terms omitted are those assigned to the bath , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - systemenvironmenttunneling ] . in this case , however , because the operator lacks degrees of freedom assigned to the bath , parity can leak to the environment decohering the qubit .",
    "as such we will ignore all `` compound '' encodings for the rest of the paper .",
    "depiction of the separation between system and bath degrees of freedom . for infinite baths",
    ", one can not construct a local operator of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : parity - string ] ) , one that is a product of a finite number of terms .",
    "if the product is truncated , parity leaks into the bath . ]    finally , we would also like to mention that the above scheme , with simple , non - compound , majorana encoding , generalizes to multiple qubits . one possible encoding ( though not the most economical ) is to use four vortices and as such four majorana modes per qubit . for this and any other encoding",
    "all possible correlators for the quantum memory may be expressed as expectation values of various products of majorana operators@xcite .",
    "all quantum coherences for our qubits may then be computed by studying majorana mode correlators which we study below .    in carrying out this program",
    ", we will analyze two distinct types of environments : the first is when couplings @xmath23 change suddenly but remain static thereafter , and the second when the environment changes dynamically .",
    "we show that that in the static environment case the tunneling hamiltonian merely leads to a finite depletion of the majorana two - time correlations . in this case , much of the information stored in these modes survives for arbitrarily long times .",
    "more generally , for dynamic environments , we obtain an expression for the rate of loss of information stored in the majorana operators that depends on the spectral density of the noise and of the fermionic bath .",
    "we present several examples of noise that can be studied essentially exactly , for instance classical telegraphic noise , as well as both classical and quantum gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the results in the paper are presented as follows :    * in section [ sec : dynamics ] we present general considerations involving the coherence properties of majorana modes .",
    "we show that under reasonably generic initial conditions the coherence of the majorana modes does not depend on their initial states .",
    "furthermore we show that the two time correlation functions , coherences , factorize as a product over coherences for individual majorana modes , that make up the quantum memory , interacting with their individual environments . as such we may reduce the problem of the coherence of the quantum memory to the problem of the coherence of one majorana mode in tunneling contact with a ( gapped ) fermionic reservoir . * in section [ sec : keldysh ]",
    "we take a first step towards a calculation of the coherence of a single majorana mode .",
    "we begin by describing the keldysh technique relevant to majorana modes .",
    "we present combinatorial tricks that make is possible to efficiently convert keldysh computations using a mixture of majorana and regular fermionic modes into a more familiar computation which uses only regular fermion modes .",
    "we then present an example where , for simplicity , we treat the fermions in the bath as free ( non - relaxing approximation ) .",
    "we also present a general formula for the coherence of a majorana qubit that is used several times in the remaining analysis . * in section [ sec : fluctuating - hamiltonians ] we present several related classical models for the fluctuations of the bath .",
    "we solve these models essentially exactly , by mapping the problem of the coherence of a single majorana mode to the problem of a particle undergoing classical diffusion .",
    "we use this technique to study classical fluctuations of the tunneling amplitudes and energy levels of the reservoir ( we primarily focus on gaussian fluctuations ) . in all cases",
    "we find decoherence with a rate that depends on the spectral density of the fluctuations in the reservoir . in many cases",
    "the decoherence due to an individual fermion mode has a power law time dependence but it will turn out that a bath made of many weakly interacting modes leads to exponential decay of coherence for intermediate times . * in section [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude . in light of the results we obtain in this paper ,",
    "we critically examine the degree in which quantum memories can be encoded using majorana fermions when these are in contact with a dynamical environment .",
    "we show that the coherence of the majorana mode is controlled by the coherence of the bath it interacts with . * in appendix",

    ", we would like to specify the initial conditions or equivalently the density matrix when the system is initialized at @xmath37 .",

    "we note that , because the initial , @xmath37 , state breaks time - translation invariance , generically these correlators are functions of both @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here",

    "the key results of this section , which are used repeatedly later in the text , may be summarized by saying that even though the factorization form given in eq .",

    "we know that the expectation value of any operator @xmath63 .",
    "finally , because @xmath53 is hermitian , it also follows from the properties above that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are hermitian as well .",

    "we see that this factorization formula is independent of the initial state of the density matrix of the bath . as such our formalism captures highly non - equilibrium initial conditions .",
    "the degree of persistence of memories assembled using majorana fermions can be quantified by the correlation between the qubit state , encoded as in eq .",

    "this is a reasonable simplified model for say the surface sates formed when an sti is placed in proximity to an s - wave superconductor .",

    "very similar arguments may be used to show that the sum ( [ eq : sumbounds ] ) is bounded for tunneling contact with any gaped material such as an insulator with the chemical potential of the p - wave superconductor lying within the gap . indeed quite generically for an itinerant system we may write the hamiltonian as @xmath482 which means that the eigenvectors of @xmath81 are similar to those of an s - wave superconductor so the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : integral ] ) above also has exponential decay for large momentum as the solutions of @xmath483 would behave almost like bessel functions . because of the gap condition there will be no finite momentum divergences either , leading to a finite integral .",
    "this argument may be extended to models with band structure . by `` folding out '' appropriate bands from the first brillouin",
    "we may convert the sum @xmath484 ( where the integral is over the first brillouin zone ) into an integral over all of k - space @xmath485 . as",
    "any possible divergence would come from high energy bands where the dispersion is essentially quadratic and the wavefunction is essentially of the continuum model , we may reduce the problem to a previously solved case .",

    "such a structure merely leads to a various matrix elements between the majorana mode and surrounding states .",
