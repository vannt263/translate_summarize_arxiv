    "the ad field is assumed to have a negative effective mass term , called a hubble - induced mass term , due to a finite energy density of the universe via supergravity effects , which implies that it obtains a large vev during and after inflation . as the energy density of the universe decreases , the effective mass decreases .",

    "the whole scenario is much simpler than the conventional scenario of adbg .",

    "note that there may be a renormalizable coupling such as w y x h_u h_d .",
    "if @xmath167 is sufficiently small , the decay rate is determined by this term and is given by t_rh 6 10 ^ 8   gev ( ) ( ) ^1/2 .",
    "however , the coupling constant @xmath83 should be suppressed by a factor of @xmath208 not to affect the inflaton potential , so that the reheating temperature is at most @xmath209  @xcite .",
    "in order to kick the phase direction and generate @xmath0 asymmetry , we need a nonzero value of @xmath168 breaking parameter @xmath167 .",
    "however , the @xmath168 breaking term makes the inflaton decay into gravitinos efficiently via supergravity effects and its decay rate is the same order with that of eq .",
    "( [ inflaton decay rate in chaotic inf ] ) . therefore , there is a gravitino problem from inflaton decay .",
    "we can avoid the problem by assuming that the gravitino is sufficiently heavy ( @xmath210 ) so as to decay before the bbn epoch and the r - parity is violated for the lsp not to overclose the universe . or",
    ", we can assume that gravitino is sufficiently light ( @xmath211 ) , in which case they do not overclose the universe .",
    "the former possibility might be well motivated partly because the observed @xmath212 higgs mass favours a heavy squark mass of order @xmath213 for a small @xmath214  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated a new scenario that the affleck - dine mechanism works just after the end of inflation .",
    "the ad field stays at a large vev by a negative hubble - induced mass term during inflation and then starts to oscillate around the origin by a positive one after inflation . at the same time , its phase direction is kicked by an a - term and @xmath0 asymmetry is generated . since its dynamics",
    "is determined by hubble - induced terms , the resulting @xmath0 asymmetry is independent of parameters in low - energy susy models .",
    "this fact makes our scenario very simple . in particular , q - balls , which sometimes form after the conventional scenario of adbg , do not form in our scenario .",
    "the a - term depends on inflation models , so that the resulting @xmath0 asymmetry does in our scenario .",
    "we have investigated the scenario and calculated the produced amount of @xmath0 asymmetry in f - term hybrid and chaotic inflation models in supergravity .",
    "we have found that our scenario requires a higher reheating temperature than the one required in the conventional scenario .",
    "this implies that adbg works in larger parameter spaces than expected in the literature .",
    "in particular , in the f - term hybrid inflation model , the required reheating temperature is naturally consistent with the gravitino overproduction bounds .",
    "the required reheating temperature is not unnaturally small even if the vev of the ad field is so large that its backreaction to inflaton dynamics becomes relevant .",
    "since the backreaction can make the spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio consistent with observations  @xcite , this is another advantage of this scenario .",
