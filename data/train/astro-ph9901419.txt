    "in the last few years , a lot of progress has been achieved in uncovering the galaxy distribution behind the milky way through various multi - wavelength approaches .",

    "theoretical predictions applied to the recent deeper sampled galaxy surveys covering volumes out to @xmath4  kms@xmath1  are reviewed , to see whether they give new indications of unknown or unsuspected prominent structures in the zoa .",
    "systematic optical galaxy catalogs are generally limited to the largest galaxies ( typically with diameters d @xmath5 , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  lauberts 1982 ) .",

    "these surveys are not biased with respect to any particular morphological type .",
    "most of the zoa has meanwhile been surveyed ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 , in kraan - korteweg 1998 ) , revealing many galaxy overdensities uncorrelated with the patchy , optical extinction distribution . analysing the galaxy density as a function of the galaxy size , magnitude and/or morphology in combination with the foreground extinction has led to the identification of various important large - scale structures and their approximate distances .",
    "although the zoa has been considerably reduced in this way ( to about 10% of the sky ) , this method does not find galaxies in the thickest extinction layers of the milky way , _",

    "the latter might be connected to the triangulum - australis cluster .",
    "recent consensus is that the great attractor ( ga ) is probably an extended region ( @xmath21 ) of moderately enhanced galaxy density ( lynden - bell 1991 , hudson 1994 ) centered behind the galactic plane at ( @xmath7 ) @xmath12 ( @xmath22 ) ( kolatt _ et  al . _  1995",
    ") .    based on a deep optical galaxy search and subsequent redshift follow - ups , kraan - korteweg _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) and woudt ( 1998 ) have clearly shown that the norma cluster , a3627 , at ( @xmath23 , 4882 ) is the most massive galaxy cluster in the ga region known to date and probably marks the previously unidentified but predicted density - peak at the bottom of the potential well of the ga overdensity .",
    "the prominence of this cluster has independently been confirmed by rosat observations : the norma cluster ranks as the 6@xmath24 brightest x - ray cluster in the sky ( bhringer _ et  al . _",
    "it is comparable in size , richness and mass to the well - known coma cluster .",
    "redshift - independent distance determinations ( r@xmath25 and i@xmath25 band tully - fisher analysis ) of the norma cluster have shown it to be at rest with respect to the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background ( woudt 1998 ) .",
    "one can not , however , exclude the possibility that other unknown rich clusters reside in the ga region . finding a hitherto uncharted",
    ", rich cluster of galaxies at the heart of the ga would have serious implications for our current understanding of this massive overdensity in the local universe .",
    "woudt ( 1998 ) found various indications that pks1343 - 601 , the second brightest extragalactic radio source in the southern sky ( @xmath26  jy , mcadam 1991 , and references therein ) might form the center of yet another highly obscured rich cluster .    at ( @xmath27 ) , this radio galaxy lies behind an obscuration layer of about 12 magnitudes of extinction in the b - band , as estimated from the dirbe / iras extinction maps ( schlegel _ et  al . _",

    "= 3872  kms@xmath1  ( west & tarenghi 1989 ) this galaxy can be identified with a giant elliptical galaxy .",
    "pks1343 - 601 has recently been observed in the x - ray band with the asca satellite ( tashiro _ et  al . _",
    "this source is not detected in the rosat all sky survey due to the large foreground extinction , i.e.  the soft x - ray emission is totally absorbed . however , extended diffuse hard x - ray emission at the position of pks1343 - 601 has been detected with asca .",
    "the excess flux , kt = 3.9  kev , is far too large for it being associated with a galactic halo surrounding the host galaxy , hence it might be due to the inverse compton process  or indicative of emission from a cluster .    as this prospective cluster is so heavily obscured , little data are available to substantiate the existence of this cluster . in figure  1 , a comparison of the a3627 cluster at ( @xmath28 ) and a mean extinction in the blue of @xmath29 is compared to the prospective pks1343 cluster at ( @xmath30 ) with an extinction of 12@xmath31 .",
    "the top panel shows both sky distributions .",
    "one can clearly see that at the low galactic latitude of the suspected cluster pks1343 , the optical galaxy survey could not retrieve the underlying galaxy distribution , especially not within the abell radius ( the inner circle in the top right panel of figure 1 ) of the suspected cluster . if pks1343 - 601 marks the dynamical center of the cluster , then the abell radius , defined as 1@xmath327/@xmath33 where @xmath33 is the redshift , corresponds to 2.2@xmath34 on the sky at the redshift - distance of pks1343 - 601 .    interestingly enough , the shallow blind zoa - multibeam hi  survey ( henning _ et  al",
    ". _ , this volume ) picks up a number of prospective cluster members even though the shallow survey is sensitive only to the most hi - rich galaxies at the cluster velocity : over 60% of the galaxies in the shallow survey with velocities from 3000 to 5000  kms@xmath1  lie in the cluster area , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  within 13% of the area covered by the shallow survey .    the velocity distribution as a function of distance from the cluster center for the pks1343 - 601 region ( bottom panel ) provides further evidence for the existence of this cluster .",
    "all measured velocities lie within a narrow range of the central radio source , showing a similar distribution as in the norma cluster .",
    "one of the first data cubes from the full sensitivity multibeam zoa survey that has been finished covers the prospective pks1343 cluster area .",
    "a quick inspection gives further support for this prospective cluster : between @xmath35  kms@xmath1  a statistically significant peak is evident in the velocity distribution ( juraszek _ et  al .",
    "_ , 1998 , priv",
    ". commun . ) .",
    "we will image the prospective cluster within its abell radius in the near infrared ( woudt _ et  al .",
    "_  in progress ) .",
    "these observations will allow us to determine whether or not pks1343 - 601 is embedded in a centrally condensed overdensity of galaxies , comparable to the rich and massive norma cluster .",
    "the iras point - source catalog ( psc ) has been exploited in the last decade to identify galaxy candidates behind the zoa . however ,",
    "confusion with galactic sources at low galactic latitudes still leave a considerable `` zoa '' of over 10% . moreover , bright spiral and starburst galaxies dominate these samples , and cluster cores are hardly visible .    the advantage of using the iras survey for lss studies are the homogeneous sky coverage ( all data from one instrument ) , and the various systematic redshift follow - ups , complete to given flux limits , _",

    "1995 ) , and @xmath12 15000 galaxies to f@xmath38  jy ( saunders _ et  al .",
    "_ , in prep . )",
    "considerable improvement towards filling the zoa has been made through the confirmation of about 1000 iras galaxy candidates in the zoa from k - band snapshots ( saunders _ et  al .",
    "_ in prep . )",
    "using the iras survey , dedicated searches for large - scale clustering within the whole zoa ( @xmath39 ) have been made by japanese groups ( _ cf .",
    "_  takata _",
    "et  al . _",
    "1996 , for a summary ) .",
    "they used iras color criteria to select galaxy candidates which were subsequently verified through visual examination on sky surveys such as the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) of the northern hemisphere and the eso / src ( united kingdom science research council ) southern sky atlas .",
    "because of their verification procedure , this data - set suffers the same limitations in highly obscured regions as optical surveys .",
    "based on redshift follow - ups of this zoa iras galaxy sample , they established various filamentary features and connections across the zoa .",
    "most coincide with the structures described in section 2.1 .",
    "both crossings of the perseus - pisces arms into the zoa are very prominent  considerably stronger in iras compared to optical data  and the puppis , hydra , centaurus and a3627 connections are clearly visible .",
    "they furthermore identified a new structure : the cygnus - lyra filament at ( @xmath40 ) .      in the regions of the highest obscuration and infrared confusion ,",
    "the galaxy is fully transparent to the 21-cm line radiation of neutral hydrogen .",
    "hi - rich galaxies can readily be found at lowest latitudes through the detection of their redshifted 21-cm emission .",
    "early - type galaxies generally are very gas - poor and will not be uncovered in hi  surveys . furthermore , low - velocity extragalactic sources ( blue- and red - shifted ) within the strong galactic hi  emission will be missed , and  because of baseline ripple ",
    "galaxies close to radio continuum sources may also be missed .    as demonstrated by the first results from systematic hi - surveys ( _ cf . _",
    "et  al . _ ,",
    "et  al . _ , and juraszek _",
    "et  al._in this volume ) , these surveys clearly are very powerful in tracing spiral and hi - rich dwarf galaxies through the deepest extinction layer of the milky way .",
    "in particular , the results from the deep multibeam zoa survey will be very exciting as they will trace the galaxy distribution across the zoa to a depth of @xmath12 10000  kms@xmath1(_cf . _  fig .  2 in kraan - korteweg _ et  al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "near infrared ( nir ) surveys are sensitive to early - type galaxies , tracers of massive groups and clusters missed in iras and hi  surveys , and have little confusion with galactic objects .",
    "moreover , they are less affected by absorption than optical surveys . here , the recent nir surveys such as 2mass ( skrutskie _ et  al . _",
    "1997 ) and denis ( epchtein 1997 ) provide a new tool to probe the zoa .",
    "first results from denis data are very promising ( _ cf .",
    "_  schrder _ et  al .",
    "_ , this volume ) .",
    "they are complementary to other surveys in the sense that they finally uncover early - type galaxies at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "furthermore , a fair fraction ( @xmath12  65% ) of the heavily obscured spiral galaxies detected in blind hi  surveys can be reidentified on denis images .",
    "the combination of hi  data with nir data allows the study of the peculiar velocity field via the nir tully  fisher relation  `` in the zoa '' compared to earlier interpolations of data `` adjacent to the zoa '' and this will , for instance , provide important new input for density field reconstructions in the zoa ( _ cf . _",
    "section  3 ) .",
    "the milky way is transparent to the hard x - ray emission , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  above 0.5 - 2.0 kev .",
    "rich clusters generally are strong x - ray emitters .",
    "hence , the x - ray surveys such as heao-1 and the rosat all sky survey provide an optimal tool to search for clusters of galaxies at low galactic latitude .",
    "so far , this possibility has not yet been pursued in any systematic way , even though a large number of x - ray bright clusters ( _ e.g. _ ,  pks0745 - 191 ) are located at low galactic latitude ( _ cf .",
    "_  fabian 1994 ) .",
    "this tool is of particular interest because it can unveil cores of clusters as , for instance , the suspected cluster surrounding pks1343 - 601 .",
    "these are dominated by early - type galaxies and therefore difficult to trace in other wavelengths .",
    "various mathematical methods exist to reconstruct the galaxy distribution in the zoa without having access to direct observations .",
    "one possibility is the expansion of galaxy distributions adjacent to the zoa into spherical harmonics to recover the structures in the zoa , either with 2-dimensional catalogs ( sky positions ) or 3-dimensional data sets ( redshift catalogs ) .",
    "a statistical method to reconstruct structures behind the milky way is the wiener filter ( wf ) , developed explicitly for reconstructions of corrupt or incomplete data ( _ cf .",
    "_  lahav 1994 , hoffman 1994 ) . using the wf in combination with linear theory allows the determination of the real - space density of galaxies , as well as their velocity and potential fields .    the potent analysis developed by bertschinger & dekel ( 1989 ) can reconstruct the potential field ( mass distribution ) from peculiar velocity fields in the zoa ( kolatt _ et  al . _",
    "the reconstruction of the potential fields versus density fields have the advantage that they can locate hidden overdensities ( their signature ) even if `` unseen '' .",
    "because of the sparsity of data and the heavy smoothing applied in all these methods , only structures on large scales ( superclusters ) can be mapped .",
    "individual ( massive ) nearby galaxies that can perturb the dynamics of the universe quite locally ( the vicinity of the local group or its barycenter ) will not be uncovered in this manner .",
    "but even if theoretical methods can outline lss accurately , the observational efforts do not become superfluous .",
    "the comparison of the real galaxy distribution @xmath42 ( * r * ) , from _",
    "e.g. _ ,  complete redshift surveys , with the peculiar velocity field * v*(*r * ) will lead to an estimate of the density and biasing parameter ( @xmath43 ) through the equation @xmath44 _ cf . _",

    "early reconstructions on relatively sparse data galaxy catalogs have been performed within volumes out to @xmath45 5000  kms@xmath1 . despite heavy smoothing",
    ", they have been quite successful in pinpointing a number of important features :    @xmath9 scharf _ et  al .",

    "@xmath9 hoffman ( 1994 ) predicted the vela supercluster at ( @xmath47 ) using 3-dimensional wf reconstructions on the iras 1.9 jy redshift catalogue ( strauss _ et  al . _",
    "1992 ) , which was observationally discovered just a bit earlier by kraan - korteweg & woudt ( 1993 ) .",

    "its density peak  to lie behind the zoa at ( @xmath48 ) . shortly thereafter , kraan - korteweg _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) unveiled the cluster a3627 as being very rich and massive and at the correct distance .",
    "it hence is the most likely candidate for the central density peak of the ga .",
    "recent reconstructions have been applied to denser galaxy samples covering larger volumes ( 8 - 10000  kms@xmath1 ) with smoothing scales of the order of 500  kms@xmath1  ( compared to 1200  kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "it therefore seemed of interest to see whether these reconstructions find evidence for unknown major galaxy structures at higher redshifts .",
    "the currently most densely - sampled , well - defined galaxy redshift catalog is the optical redshift survey ( santiago _ et  al . _  1995",
