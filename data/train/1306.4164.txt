    "a topological index of a graph is a number attributed to a graph in a way that it is derived from the structure of the graph but so that it does nt depend on the labeling of vertices in a graph .",
    "chemical graph theory is a branch of graph theory whose focus of interest is finding topological indices of chemical graphs ( i.e. graphs that represent chemical molecules ) which correlate well with chemical properties of the corresponding molecules .",
    "one of the most famous topological indices is wiener index , defined as the sum of all distances between different vertices of a molecular graph , introduced by wiener in 1947 ( see @xcite ) in a paper concerned with boiling points of alkanes . in a research that followed many other useful properties of wiener index",
    "were discovered ( for a survey of mathematical properties and chemical applications of wiener index one can look into @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "but , contrary to chemical intuition , the contribution of close pairs of vertices to the overall value of the index was much smaller than that of distant vertices . to deal with this inconsistency ,",
    "the new index was proposed which was named harary index ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "harary index is defined as the sum of all reciprocal values of distances between different vertices of a molecular graph .",
    "properties of harary index were then extensively researched ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "but it turned out that this modification of wiener index has not solved the inconsistency as expected . in order to improve the performance of harary - type indices ,",
    "several modifications were proposed recently . in @xcite",
    "the authors increased the attenuation of contributions of vertex pairs with their distance .",
    "in @xcite an attempt was made in a different direction , the authors introduced a correction that gives more weight to the contributions of pairs of vertices of high degrees .",
    "this modification was named additively weighted harary index .",
    "the aim of this paper is to establish the upper and lower bound for the value of additively weighted harary index on the class of unicyclic graphs and to characterize all extremal graphs .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce necessary definitions and preliminary results . in section 3",
    "we characterize all maximal unicyclic graphs by introducing several graph transformations which increase the value of additively weighted harary index and which , when applied combined finitely many times , lead to extremal unicyclic graphs . in section 4",
    "we do the same for minimal unicyclic graphs with respect to additively weighted harary index . finally , in section 5 we give the conclusion and directions for further research .",
