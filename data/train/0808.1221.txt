    "the neutral current @xmath3 production in neutrino interactions plays an important role in the background studies of @xmath6 oscillations in the appearance mode as well as in discriminating between @xmath7 and @xmath8 modes  @xcite .",
    "this process can also help to distinguish between production of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in some oscillation scenarios at neutrino energies much below the @xmath11 production threshold but above the pion threshold  @xcite .",
    "the recent results on neutral current induced pion production in neutrino oscillation experiments at k2k  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite have generated great interest in studying these processes . in this context , the proposed experiments by t2k  @xcite and no@xmath1a  @xcite collaborations plan to study this process with better statistics .",
    "the neutral pions can also be produced by electromagnetic interactions if @xmath12 have diagonal and/or transition magnetic moments .",
    "this process would in principle contribute additional events to the neutral current reaction and would modify the energy and angular distributions of the neutral pions , which may be observed in future experiments .",
    "it is thus possible , in principle , to get information about the magnetic moment of neutrinos(antineutrinos ) from studying neutral current induced @xmath5 production from nucleons and nuclei . while the minimal extensions of standard model predict very tiny diagonal magnetic moments  @xcite , there are models of electroweak interactions which predict enhanced transition magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "the present limits for the magnetic moment of neutrinos come from neutrino - electron scattering for @xmath13 and from @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "these limits for @xmath16 and @xmath9 magnetic moments are @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite .    the data from neutrino oscillation experiments from sudbury neutrino observatory and super - kamiokande have also been analysed to obtain improved limits on the neutrino magnetic moments for @xmath13 and @xmath15  @xcite . a recent analysis of the borexino experiment claims to improve these limits on the magnetic moments of @xmath13 and @xmath15 by 3 orders of magnitude@xcite .",
    "we would like to consider the possibility of obtaining new bounds on the neutrino magnetic moment using high statistics data on neutral current induced @xmath5 production from nucleons and nuclei in future experiments . such a possibility was earlier discussed by kang et al .",

    "these pions are produced on nuclear targets like @xmath90 . in the case of nuclear targets , there are incoherent as well as coherent production of @xmath3 which have different angular and momentum distributions .",
    "an analysis of these experiments in order to study the neutrino magnetic moment would require an understanding of nuclear effects in the incoherent and coherent production of @xmath3 induced by the neutral currents as well as by the neutrino magnetic moment on nuclear targets in the energy region of 1 gev .",
    "we would like to conclude that it is possible in principle to study the neutrino magnetic moment from the observations of neutral current induced @xmath3 production from nuclear targets in the near detector in future neutrino oscillation experiments by t2k & no@xmath1a collaborations .",
    "however , with the present limits on @xmath4 the magnetic moment induced @xmath3 production cross sections are quite smaller then the weak neutral current induced cross sections .",
    "it is , therefore , not a feasible method to constrain the neutrino magnetic moment beyond the present experimental limits .",
