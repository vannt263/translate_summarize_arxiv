    "<S> one useful expedient is to extract them from the oc measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> since the dominant optical peak appears near @xmath70 , we can estimate @xmath71@xmath72 ev for na@xmath10iro@xmath11 based on the existing oc data , which exhibits a one - peak structure around 1.6 ev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ev ) , our results for the oc and rixs spectra in figs .  [ fig4](c ) and ( f ) are both indeed in good quantitative agreement with the experiments  @xcite , except for a double - peak structure around 0.7 ev ( @xmath75 ) observed in the rixs experiment , instead of a single peak found in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](f ) . here , our calculations assume the cubic crystal field . </S>",
    "<S> however , the crystal structure of na@xmath10iro@xmath11 is known to display the additional trigonal distortion  @xcite , thus significantly departing from the ideal iro@xmath76 octahedra  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this additional distortion can mix the relativistic @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals , and lead to the splitting of the dominant rixs peak of the local @xmath7-@xmath7 transition into multiple subpeaks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that the single peak found in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](f ) is split into two ( or multiple ) subpeaks in the presence of the trigonal distortion  @xcite ( see also refs .  </S>",

    "<S> as discussed in supplemental material  @xcite , the low - energy peak attributed to the local @xmath7-@xmath7 transition [ ` a ' in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the experimental fact that the intensity of the low - energy peak near 0.3 ev is much weaker than that of the dominant peak around 1.2 ev suggests that the strength of @xmath86 is not as large as the theoretical estimation  @xcite .    </S>",
