    "the discovery of giant magnetoresistance in 1988 @xcite gave birth to a new field in condensed matter , the magneto- or spin  electronics @xcite .",
    "contrary to the conventional electronics it is the spin of the electron and not its charge which plays the central role .",
    "key compounds to maximize the efficient of the devices based on spintronics are the so - called half - metallic materials which are ferromagnets where there is a band gap at the fermi level ( @xmath0 ) for the minority spin band while the majority spin band is metallic .",
    "attractive candidates for half - metallic materials are the half - heusler alloys and it is mainly nimnsb which has attracted most of the attention .",
    "nimnsb was also the first material to be predicted to be a half - metal in 1983 by de groot and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "there exist several other ab - initio calculations on nimnsb reproducing the results of de groot @xcite and galanakis _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the gap arises from the hybridization between the @xmath1 orbitals of the ni and mn atoms @xcite .",
    "its half - metallicity seems to be well - established in the case of single crystals ; infrared absorption @xcite and spin - polarized positron - annihilation @xcite gave evidence supporting it .",
    "the interest in the case of nimnsb films has been focused mainly to films grown along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "several experimental groups have grown such films @xcite and they were found not be half - metallic @xcite ; a maximum value of 58% for the spin - polarization of nimnsb was obtained by soulen _",
    "also several ab - initio calculations exist on the ( 001 ) surfaces films and all the results agree that the half - metallicity is lost due to surface states @xcite . on the other hand van roy and collaborators",
    "have managed to grow ( 111 ) films of nimnsb on top of gaas(111 ) substrates @xcite .",
    "these films were found to contain inclusions of mnsb and nisb @xcite and to show a large amount of defects @xcite but their magnetic properties have not been studied .    in this communication",
    "i study the ( 111 ) surfaces of the half - metallic nimnsb heusler alloy .",
    "i take into account all possible six terminations and show that in all cases there is a minority surface states in the region of the gap . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "i discuss the structure of the surface and the computational details and in section [ sec3 ] i present and analyze my results .",
    "finally in section [ sec4 ] i summarize and conclude .",
    "in the calculations i used the the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green s function method @xcite within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) in conjunction with the local spin - density approximation @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential @xcite . the asa calculations take into account the full charge density . to simulate the surface i used a slab with 33 metal layers embedded in half - infinite vacuum from each side .",
    "this slab thickness is enough so that the layers in the middle exhibit bulk properties ; they show a spin - down gap of the same width as in the bulk and the same relative position of the fermi level and finally the magnetic moments differ less than 0.01@xmath2 from the bulk values . here",
    "i should mention that this number of layers is much larger than the one needed in the case of the ( 001 ) surfaces @xcite due to the very intense surface states pinned at the fermi level ( see results in next section ) .",
    "i have also converged the * q*@xmath3-space grid , the number of energy points and the tight binding cluster so that the properties of the surfaces do not change ( similar dos and spin moments ) .",
    "so i have used a two - dimensional 30@xmath430 * q*@xmath3-space grid to perform the integrations in the first surface brillouin zone . to evaluate the charge density one has to integrate the green s function over an energy contour in the complex energy plane ; for this 42 energy points were needed .",
    "a tight - binding cluster of 51 atoms was used in the calculation of the screened kkr structure constants @xcite . finally for the wavefunctions i took angular momentum up to @xmath5 into account and for the charge density up to @xmath6 .",
    "schematic representations of the ( 111 ) surface .",
    "each layers has a single atomic character .",
    "if i neglect the chemical character of the atoms in the @xmath7 structure of nimnsb then the lattice is the bcc .",
    "note also that there are two different terminations for each element , _",
    "e.g. _ when the surface is terminated by ni the subsurface layers can be either a mn one or an sb one . in the figure",
    "i show both of them together with the corresponding sequence of atoms .",
    "`` s '' stands for surface and `` 1 , 2 , 3 '' are the positions within the surface unit cell for succesive layers . ]    in figure [ fig1 ] i present the structure of the ( 111 ) surfaces in the case of nimnsb .",
    "nimnsb crystallizes in the @xmath7 structure .",
    "if one neglects the difference in the chemical character of the atoms then the underlying lattice is a simple bcc .",
    "thus along the [ 111 ] direction the alloy is consisted from alternating layers containing only one chemical element . in the case of a ni terminated surface , as the one shown in the figure , there are two different possibilities : either to have a mn subsurface layer or an sb one .",
    "i denote the first case as ni@xmath8 and the second as ni@xmath9 . similarly mn and sb terminated surfaces can have either a ni subsurface layer or one consisted from voids ( denoted as vd in the article ) .",
    "of course in real systems no voids exist but its use is obligatory in the calculations to take correctly into account the charge distribution in the vacuum .",
    "the surface unit cell is a rhombus and when passing from one layer to a neighboring one , the atoms slide along the big diagonal and are positioned at 1/3 or 2/3 of its length ( in the figure atoms in successive layers are denoted by 1 , 2 or 3 ) .",
    "i have used in all my calculations the experimental lattice constant of nimnsb of 5.909 @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "finally i should mention that since my slab is made of 33 atoms i have two inequivalent surfaces .",
    "for example if the one surface is the ni@xmath8 then the other one should be the ni@xmath9 surface .",
    ".atomic spin moments given in @xmath2 for the ni terminated ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "`` s '' denotes the surface layer . in parenthesis the bulk values .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < , > , < , > \" , ]     following the same arguments as for mn , one can understand also the behavior of the spin moments for the sb terminated surfaces presented in table [ table3 ] .",
    "the absolute value of the sb spin moment at the surface layer increases with respect to the bulk as was also the case for the mnsb terminated ( 001 ) surfaces @xcite",
    ". when the subsurface layer is the vd one , the hybridization effects are less important and the sb spin moment can reach a value of -0.20 @xmath2 almost triple the bulk value of -0.07 @xmath2 and double the value for the ( 001 ) surface of @xmath11 @xmath2 .",
    "the change in the sb @xmath12-bands influences also through hybridization the bands of the transition metal atoms for which now the minority bands population increases leading to smaller spin moments of the ni and mn atoms at the subsurface layers .",
    "the phenomenon is more intense in the case of sb@xmath13 where the ni layer is just below the sb surface layer and the reduction in the spin moments of ni and sb is much larger than the sb@xmath14 case .",
    "same as figure [ fig2 ] for the mn@xmath15 and sb@xmath15 terminated surfaces . ]    finally in figure [ fig3 ] i have gathered the dos for the first four layers in the case of ni subsurface layers .",
    "results are similar also when i have the voids as subsurface layer . in the case of the mn terminated surface",
    ", there is a minority surface state pinned exactly at the fermi level which destroys the half - metallicity and which survives also at the ni subsurface layer .",
    "but at the next mn layer ( not shown here ) it vanishes .",
    "overall the dos s are similar to the bulk case and the increase of the mn spin moment at the interface is taken care of high - energy lying majority antibonding @xmath1-states which in the bulk are above the fermi level but now move below it pushing also somewhat lower in energy the majority bands @xcite .",
    "also in the case of the sb terminated surface there is a minority surface state slightly below the fermi level but which also destroys the half - metallicity at the surface .",
    "its intensity is large also for the ni at the subsurface layer but already for the mn atom it starts to smear out .",
    "i have studied using an ab - initio technique the electronic and magnetic properties of the ( 111 ) surface of nimnsb taking into account different terminations . in all cases there",
    "is a minority surface state which kills the half - metallicity at the surface .",
    "it is pinned at the fermi level for the ni and mn terminated surfaces but it is slightly below the fermi level for the sb one .",
    "it is localized close to the surface region and normally vanishes within four atomic layers .    in the case of the ni surface with mn as subsurface layer , ni@xmath8 , the loss of three out of the four sb first neighbors leads to a doubling of the ni spin moment while in the ni@xmath9 case it is near the bulk value . for the mn and sb terminations the lowering of",
    "the coordination increases the surface spin moments and the enhancement is larger when there is a subsurface layer made by voids .",
    "finally i should add that from point of view of transport a single surface state does not affect the magnetoconductance since the wavefunction is orthogonal to all bulk states incident to the surface .",
    "it is the interaction of the surface state with other defect states in the bulk and/or with surface defects which makes these states conducting and leads to the low spinpolarization values for films derived by andreev reflection measurements .",
