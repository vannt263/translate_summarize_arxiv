    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) are a softer class of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with a @xmath6 spectrum that peaks at energies @xmath7  kev  @xcite .",
    "they make up around a third of the grb population and their defining characteristic is a high x - ray fluence ( @xmath8 ) relative to their gamma - ray fluence ( @xmath9 ) such that log[@xmath10/@xmath9]@xmath12 .",
    "classical grbs have log[@xmath8/@xmath9]@xmath13 , and bursts with intermediate fluence ratios are referred to as x - ray rich ( xrr ) bursts .",
    "all three classes of burst are distributed isotropically on the sky and share many temporal and spectral properties .",
    "their prompt emission light curves are similar in duration and structure , and their spectra are well fit by the ` band ' function  @xcite .",
    "the differentiating feature in the context of the band model is the spectral break energy .",
    "most grbs have observed peak energies in the range @xmath14  kev  @xcite , whereas xrfs have @xmath15  kev that can be as low as 3  kev  @xcite .",
    "other similarities exist in a number of empirical laws that are satisfied by all three classes of bursts .",
    "the burst populations form a continuum in the [ @xmath16  kev ) , @xmath17-plane  @xcite , and the amati relation  @xcite is satisfied by at least three xrfs  @xcite , which relates a grb s peak energy @xmath18 to its isotropic equivalent energy @xmath19 such that @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "theoretical models that aim to explain the origins of xrfs include ( 1 ) grbs at high redshift  @xcite , which in this context is at redshifts @xmath21 , ( 2 ) a baryon loaded fireball ( dirty fireball model )  @xcite , ( 3 ) a clean fireball ( @xmath22 ) where the difference in lorentz factor between colliding shells is small  @xcite , ( 4 ) a photosphere - dominated model  @xcite , and ( 5 ) classical grbs seen off - axis , either within the context of a uniform jet model  @xcite or a universal structured jet model  @xcite .",
    "the broad range of properties shared by xrfs , xrr bursts and grbs suggests that all three classes are due to the same underlying phenomenon and that there should be a single model to explain their origins . @xcite and @xcite suggested a dominating baryonic photosphere with an extended optically thick region caused by pair - producing shocks as a source of excess x - ray emission .",
    "however , such a model requires additional considerations to account for those bursts with @xmath23  kev , as is the case for xrf  020427  @xcite , xrf  020903  @xcite and xrf  010213  @xcite .",
    "models that require the grb jet to be observed off - axis have been particularly successful at explaining observations of xrfs ( e.g. fynbo et al .",
    "2004 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2005 ) , and their ability to describe both grbs and xrfs in a unified way have made them increasingly popular .",
    "afterglows have now been detected for a number of xrfs from the x - ray down to radio wavebands  @xcite .",
    "the first x - ray and radio afterglows were discovered in 2001 ( xrf  011030 ; taylor et al .",
    "2001 ; harrison et al .",
    "2001 ) , and in 2002 the first xrf optical afterglow was observed ( xrf  020903 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2004 ) . since then only a handful of xrfs",
    "have had associated optical counterparts ( e.g. xrf  030429 , xrf  030528 , xrf  030723 , xrf  040916 , xrf  050315 , xrf  050416a ) , with the earliest observation of an optical afterglow detection taking place 31.3  mins after the initial burst ( xrf  030723 ; smith et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in this paper we describe _ swift _ observations of xrf  050406 , focusing in particular on the optical / uv band data ( see  @xcite for a detailed analysis of the x - ray data ) .",
    "these are the earliest observations taken of an xrf optical counterpart to date , beginning only 88  s after the initial emission . in section  [ sec : obs ] we review the observations made by all 3 instruments on - board _ swift _ followed by an analysis of the temporal and spectral behaviour of the xrf in the uv , optical and x - ray energy bands in sections  [ sec : lc ] and [ sec : spec ] . in section  [ sec : disc ] we discuss the results and investigate their implications for xrf theoretical models .",
    "the conclusions are summarised in section  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "on 2005 april 6 the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ) triggered and located on - board xrf  050406 , at 15:58:48 ut  @xcite .",
    "the bat location calculated on - board was ra = @xmath24 , dec=@xmath25 ( j2000 ; parsons el al . 2005 ) .",

    "this corresponds to a galactic latitude of @xmath30 with a local reddening of @xmath31 = 0.022 mag  @xcite and a galactic column density of @xmath32  @xcite .",

    "the burst was very soft , with most flux emitted below 50  kev .",
    "the time - averaged spectrum was well fit by a simple power - law model ( @xmath35 for 73 d.o.f . ) , a cutoff power - law model ( @xmath36 for 72 d.o.f . ) , and the band spectral model ( @xmath37 for 71 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the best fit @xmath18 value in the latter two models was @xmath38  kev and @xmath39  kev .",
    "a simple power - law spectral fit does not constrain the value of @xmath18 . however",
    ", the steep best - fit spectral index of @xmath40 suggests that the observed @xmath1-ray spectrum corresponds to the high - energy portion of the band model . in this case",
    "a spectral break must have occurred near or below the lower limit of the bat energy band , at @xmath41  kev .",
    "the @xmath42 fluence in the 15 - 350  kev band was @xmath43  @xmath44 , with @xmath45  @xmath44  lying in the 15 - 50  kev band , and @xmath46  @xmath44  in the 15 - 100  kev band , making up more than @xmath47 of the total fluence .",
    "the spacecraft executed an automated slew to the bat position , and within 72  s the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows et al .",
    "2005a ) was on target and imaging the field .",
    "ground analysis of the data revealed a fading x - ray source within the bat error circle @xmath48 from the bat position  @xcite .    the ultra - violet / optical telescope ( uvot ; roming et al .",
    "2005a ) began settled observations of the field of xrf  050406 88  s after the bat trigger , and carried out an automated series of observations amounting to 89 exposures in 3 optical and 3 ultra - violet filters .",
    "the first exposure taken was a 100  s _",
    "v_-filter ` finding chart ' followed by 10  s exposures in each passband for 9 rotations of the filter wheel , after which a series of @xmath49  s and then @xmath50  s exposures were made .",

    "v_@xmath52  @xcite .",
    "however , analysis of the _ v _ band image data , which is processed on the ground , revealed a faint source @xmath53 above background within the reported @xmath54 radius xrt error circle , with @xmath55 .",
    "the initial lack of detection was the result of the difference in the drift corrections applied on - board to that applied on the ground processed data .",
    "the lower accuracy of the on - board drift corrections caused the optical afterglow to be lost within the background noise in the first dataset analysed .",
    "the position of the uncatalogued source is ra = @xmath56 , dec = @xmath57 ( j2000 ) with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath58 , consistent with the position reported by  @xcite who detected a faint source in r and i band observations taken with the magellan / clay telescope .",
    "the source was no longer observed above background in any of the subsequent _",
    "v_-band images , either in the individual or co - added exposures .",
    "the source was detected in the uvot _ b _ and _ u _ bands , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 at 423  s and 226  s after the prompt emission , respectively .",
    "@xmath61  s after the burst trigger the source was no longer detected above background in either the _ v _ , _ b _ or _ u _ band , confirming this source as the fading afterglow of xrf  050406 . a co - added image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ubvimage ] ) constructed from all exposures in the _ v _ , _ b _ and _ u _ bands up to 1000  s after the burst provided a @xmath62 level detection .",
    "photometry of the images was carried out using a @xmath63 radius aperture , which was found to maximise the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the source detection .",
    "this is smaller than the psf fwhm corresponding to each filter , and therefore a correction was applied to account for the loss of source photon counts in the wings of the psf .",
    "the best - fit power law decay indices to the _ b _ and _ u _ light curves are poorly constrained due to the faintness of the source , with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and a combined fit to both filters yields @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "all errors quoted in this section are at the @xmath68 level .    to obtain a higher s / n light curve the neighbouring pairs of _ u _ and",
    "_ b _ exposures were co - added , on the assumption that there was no colour evolution during this time period .",
    "it is possible that the cooling break could have passed through the optical bands at this time , causing a spectral break between the bands and a difference in their temporal decay rate .",
    "the quality of the data does not allow for this to be verified .",
    "however , such a migration of the cooling frequency is typically observed to occur at later times , on the order of @xmath69  s ( e.g. see blustin et al . 2005 ) , thus making such an assumption reasonable . this provided a total of nine images with an effective exposure of @xmath70  s and two images with effective exposures of @xmath71  s , where the last two co - added exposures provided only upper limits .",
    "the co - added _ ub _ exposures yield a best - fit power - law decay index of @xmath72 over the time interval @xmath73t+200 to @xmath73t+6000  s. this is consistent with the _ v _ band observations where the afterglow must have decayed at a rate of @xmath74 to account for the drop in count rate from 0.22  @xmath75  down to below the background level in @xmath76  s. the _ v _ band light curve consists of a 100  s exposure , a @xmath77s exposure and a 900  s exposure , and is shown against the _ ub _ light curve in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the source magnitudes for the independent _ v _ , _ b _ , and _ u _ exposures and the combined _ ub _ exposures upto @xmath78  s are listed in table  [ tab : timephot ] .",
    "observations that have count rates lower than @xmath79  @xmath75are treated as upper limits , and it is the error on the background subtracted count rate that is given as the upper limit .",
    "event - mode data are available for all filters for the first 1200  s of uvot observations , in which timing information is stored with a resolution of 11  ms .",
    "the source count rate in the _ v _ filter during the first 100  s of data was only @xmath80  @xmath75 , which restricts the temporal information available during this time interval . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test was performed to compare the temporal distribution of counts during the first 100  s _ v _ exposure ( t+88 to t+188 sec ) with that observed from a source decaying as a power - law with photon index @xmath81 ( corresponding to the _ ub _ light curve decay rate ) .",
    "the probability that the model and observed dataset derive from the same distribution is @xmath82 . for comparison ,",
    "the observed dataset is consistent to constant emission with a probability @xmath83 , and it has a probability @xmath84 of being consistent to a source brightening as a power law with photon index @xmath85 . to illustrate the difficulty associated with determining the optical afterglow temporal behaviour in the first 100s uvot observations , figure  [ fig : vlc ] shows the change observed in the _ v _ band light curve when the finding chart exposure is split up into segments of differing lengths .",
    "a rising behaviour is derived when the finding chart is split into three segments of 35  s , 35  s and 30  s exposures , whereas a @xmath86s split produces a decaying light curve .",
    "it is worth noting that during this time period a bright flare is observed in the x - ray light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , bottom panel ) , where the light curve brightened by a factor of 6 between 150 and 213  s post - burst . based on the best - fit decay slope to the co -",
    "added ub filters , which predicts a flux of @xmath87  @xmath75   at 213  s , an equivalent re - brightening in the optical band during this time would have caused the flux to be 3.78  @xmath75 ; more than 8 times the observed count rate in the first ub bins .",
    "the multi - wavelength observations carried out by the uvot provide spectral information in the wavelength range @xmath88  -@xmath89   . using each optical and uv filter as an energy bin ,",
    "a spectrum was produced for the time period 220 - 950  s after the bat trigger .",
    "this interval is when the filters are cycling rapidly , ensuring that each band is sampling the same average in the decay curve .",
    "all quoted errors on the best - fit spectral parameters are at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the uvot exposures taken during this time period were co - added according to filter , producing an @xmath90  s exposure for the _ v_-band , and @xmath91  s exposures in all other filters .",
    "uvot source and background data files compatible with the spectral fitting code xspec ( v12.2.0 ; arnaud 1996 ) were created using the tool ` uvot2pha ' .",
    "the source extraction region used was selected to optimise the s / n ratio . to maintain consistency throughout the filters",
    "the source aperture size was chosen to contain @xmath92 of the counts emitted by the afterglow , which varied between @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and an aperture size correction was applied .",
    "the background was determined from an annular region around the source .",
    "the count rates and corresponding fluxes for each of the uvot exposures used in the spectrum are listed in table  [ tab : specphot ] .",
    "a fit using a simple power law model that took into account galactic reddening provided a statistically unacceptable fit ( @xmath95 for 4 d.o.f . ) , with best - fit photon index @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the addition of a lyman absorption edge at a free floating redshift significantly improved the fit ( @xmath98 for 2 d.o.f . ) , and yielded a spectral index of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the analysis was repeated employing cash statistics  @xcite , which uses a likelihood function to fit a model to the data .",
    "this is more appropriate given the low source photon count rate and provides more rigorous confidence intervals",
    ". a re - fit to the spectrum using a power - law model with galactic absorption and extinction included and a lyman absorption edge at a free floating redshift produced best - fit parameters consistent with those found with a @xmath101 minimisation fit .",
    "the fit yielded @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    to provide tighter constraints on the spectral behaviour of the afterglow the uvot and xrt data were combined to produce a broadband spectrum .",
    "good xrt events were extracted from time interval t+350 to t+950  s after the prompt emission , in order to exclude the x - ray flare .",
    "this only provided 27 events , which were therefore binned into one data point . using cash statistics , the best - fit parameters for a power law model with galactic absorption and reddening and neutral gas incorporated at a free floating redshift were @xmath104 and @xmath105 , consistent with the results from a @xmath101 statistics fit , which had a reduced @xmath106 ( 2.3/3 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the derived redshift is typical of that measured in the _ swift _ sample , which has a mean redshift of @xmath107  @xcite , and the best - fit spectral index is in agreement with that inferred from the x - ray data alone ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "there is therefore no indication of a spectral break between the x - ray and optical bands at this time .",
    "this fit is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the optical observations of the xrf  050406 taken with the _ swift_/uvot telescope comprise the earliest detection of an x - ray flash optical counterpart to date . combining the optical / uv observations with simultaneous x - ray data provide multiwavelength temporal and spectral information on the characteristics of the very early burst afterglow .",
    "analysis of this early time data constrains the nature of xrfs and the various theoretical models that have been put forward to explain their origin .",
    "the flare observed in the x - ray light curve has been ascribed to emission from internal shocks several hundred seconds after the end of the @xmath1-ray emission  @xcite .",
    "previous early observations made of grb optical counterparts have shown evidence for both uncorrelated ( grb  990123 ; akerlof et al .",
    "1999 , grb  050401 ; rykoff et al . 2005 ) and correlated ( grb  041219a ; vestrand et al .",
    "2005 , blake et al . 2005 ) @xmath1-ray and optical behaviour .",
    "however , the lack of such a flare in the optical / uv flux suggests that there is little contribution to the optical emission from internal shocks in this burst .",
    "excluding the flare , the x - ray light curve is well fit by a broken power - law with a best - fit early time index @xmath109 , flattening out to a decay rate of @xmath110 at @xmath111  s  @xcite .",
    "the x - ray decay rate before the break and the x - ray spectral index ( @xmath108 ) are consistent with afterglow emission in the fast - cooling regime for @xmath112 , or the slow - cooling regime for @xmath113  @xcite , where an electron power - law distribution index p=2.5 is obtained in both cases . assuming an electron power - law distribution index p=2.5 , the optical decay index is only consistent with a fireball in the fast - cooling regime interacting with a wind circumburst environment , where @xmath114  @xcite .",
    "however , the flattening observed in the x - ray light curve can not be explained with such a model .    the x - ray decay index after @xmath111  s is consistent with that observed in the optical , and the flat decay in both energy bands could be the result of long lasting engine activity that continues injecting energy into the fireball through refreshed shocks  @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism has been invoked to explain the shallow decay observed in grb  050319  @xcite and grb  050401  @xcite .",
    "the continuous luminosity injection of the central engine is denoted by @xmath115 , and it is dominant over the fireball emission when @xmath116  @xcite .",
    "the fireball model with additional energy injection is consistent with observations for @xmath117  @xcite , and a wind environment in the slow cooling regime gives temporal decay indices closest to observations .",
    "a small spread in the lorentz factor of the ejecta could also cause a shallow decay flux in the range of @xmath118 .",
    "faster shells with larger lorentz factors would be slowed down through interactions with the surrounding circumburst material , and as the slower shells caught up , on - going shocks would reduce the cooling rate  @xcite .",
    "this ` shallow ' flux decay would only be expected to continue until @xmath69  s , after which the blandford - mckee self similar external shock evolution would become dominant and cause a steepening in the temporal decay , as is observed for a significant number of the _ swift _ grb sample  @xcite . in the case of xrf  050406",
    "the x - ray light curve continues to decay at a constant rate with power law index @xmath119 , until it is no longer detected after @xmath120  s. in order to account for this extended period of shallow flux additional factors have to be incorporated into this model  @xcite ( see romano et al . 2005 ) .",
    "another explanation is that the shallow decay is caused by a structured jet observed off - axis , where the amount of flux received from the wings of the jet would increase with time as the ejecta slowed down and the lorentz factor decreased  @xcite .",
    "if the shallow decay is the result of continual engine activity or emission from late - time shocks , the early x - ray steep decay can only be attributed to the standard afterglow if the fireball energetics during this time dominate .",
    "alternatively , the steep decline could be the result of an additional flux component no longer significant after @xmath111  s. this source of hard emission could be either the tail of the prompt emission or continual x - ray flaring , both of which would not be expected to contaminate the optical band . such flaring has been observed in other _ swift _",
    "grbs  @xcite , although they typically have decay indices in the range @xmath121 .",
    "the curvature effect should cause the light curve to fall as @xmath122  @xcite , which is much steeper than the decay observed in the x - ray before @xmath111  s. however , this decay rate assumes a uniform jet that is powered by a central engine which abruptly turns off at some time , after which the high - latitude emission is observed .",
    "a model in which the central engine activity is reduced would produce a shallower decay , as would also an off - axis structured jet , where both the energy and lorentz factor vary with jet angle  @xcite . at viewing angles larger than the core jet angle , emission from the core",
    "would be observed at later times , and the drop of flux would therefore be slower . an additionally factor that can also flattern the tail emission decay is an underlying forward shock component .",
    "the detection in the three optical filters and upper limits obtained at wavelengths blue - ward of @xmath123    firmly constrain the redshift of the burst to @xmath124 , beyond which the lyman edge is shifted into the optical wavebands .",
    "a model fit to the broadband spectrum that incorporates a lyman absorption edge provides a best - fit redshift of @xmath125 . at such a redshift xrf  050406",
    "would have an @xmath126  kev , nearly a factor of 10 lower than that of a grb at @xmath127 with a typical observed peak energy value @xmath128  kev .",
    "the softer spectrum observed in xrf  050406 can not , therefore , be solely accounted for by a high - redshift burst .",
    "a decelerating baryon loaded fireball ( @xmath129 ) , referred to as a ` dirty ' fireball , can produce transient emissions that are longer lasting and most luminous at x - ray energies  @xcite .",
    "in such a model the non - thermal synchrotron emission is produced by a relativistic blast wave that decelerates and radiates by sweeping up particles from the circumburst medium ( external shock model ) , and the hardness and duration of the burst is a function of the baryon load .",
    "the observed peak frequency is strongly dependent on @xmath130 , with @xmath131  @xcite and the timescale over which the bulk of the power is radiated is the deceleration timescale @xmath132  @xcite where @xmath133 .",
    "thus a dirty fireball with an initial lorentz factor @xmath134 makes the blast wave very inefficient at emitting @xmath1-rays , and produces a long lasting soft burst .    a soft burst with a peak energy value @xmath18 of e.g. an order of magnitude smaller than that observed in typical grbs ( @xmath135  kev ) would have a @xmath130 value a factor of around two smaller .",
    "such a burst would therefore produce a burst with peak power output lasting a factor of @xmath136 longer .",
    "the prompt emission from xrf  050406 only lasted 5.7  s , which is around a factor of 6 shorter than typical long grbs , whose duration distribution peaks at @xmath137  s. furthermore , at a redshift of 2.44 the rest frame burst duration would be @xmath138  s , placing it into the extreme short tail of long grbs .",
    "a dirty fireball model therefore fails to simultaneously account for the shortness of this burst as well as its softness .",
    "an alternative mechanism that can produce a burst with soft prompt emission is an internal shock model in which the fireball has a high average lorentz factor @xmath139 , and a fairly even @xmath130 distribution within the ejecta  @xcite . using a simplified internal shock model to simulate a large number of bursts @xcite found that ejected matter with an overall large average lorentz factor @xmath139 but small variation in the lorentz factor within the material reproduced well the observed properties of xrfs . whereas the dependence on redshift , duration and injected power remained fairly similar between xrfs and grbs , the small contrast in @xmath130 between colliding shells reduced the efficiency of energy dissipation through internal shocks , thus causing the prompt emission of these bursts to be weak and soft .",
    "a measure of the efficiency of a burst is provided by the ratio of the @xmath1-ray fluence in the 15 - 350  kev energy band , @xmath9 , to the x - ray flux during its afterglow phase , 1 hour after the burst  @xcite . for typical grbs",
    "this ratio produces a continuum on a log  @xmath9-log  @xmath140 plot  @xcite .",
    "if the softer spectrum observed in xrf  050406 is indeed the result of lower efficiency during the prompt phase of the burst then one would expect the @xmath141 ratio to be small relative to classical grbs . on a log  @xmath9-log",
    "@xmath140 plot xrf  050406 lies within a @xmath142 band of the @xmath141 distribution for a sample of 22 grbs ( see fig .  3 of roming et al .",
    "there is therefore no evidence for lower efficiency in the prompt emission of xrf  050406 .",
    "another possible model to explain the observed properties of xrfs is a grb viewed off - axis .",
    "there are two main sub - categories related to the structure of the collimated flow : a uniform jet or a structured jet . in a uniform jet the lorentz factor and energy distribution is constant within the jet but has a sharp cutoff at the edges , whereas in the structured jet model the bulk lorentz factor and the energy per unit solid angle vary with the angular distance from the jet - axis @xmath143 .    in the case of a uniform jet an xrf",
    "is presumed to be a grb observed at an angle greater than the jet half - opening angle , @xmath144 .",
    "radiation is beamed into an angle @xmath145 , where @xmath130 is the initial bulk lorentz factor of the relativistic outflow , and at lines of sight outside of the jet , the bulk of the radiation that is observed is at lower energies with frequencies @xmath146 , where @xmath147\\simeq [ 1+\\gamma^{2}(\\theta_{v}-\\theta_{j})^{2}]/2\\gamma$ ] is the doppler factor  @xcite ; @xmath148 therefore decreases as the viewing angle increases . as the lorentz factor drops the radiation",
    "is beamed into a larger angle and a greater portion of the radiation reaches the observer .",
    "this , combined with the fading nature of the source afterglow , produces a flatter or even rising early - time light curve relative to that observed from a grb viewed on - axis  @xcite , and it peaks when @xmath149 . from here on the radiation from the jet core is beamed into the line of sight , and the light curve then begins to decay .",
    "for on - axis grbs a break in the light curve is expected at a time @xmath150  @xcite , where @xmath151 is the jet opening angle , and this is typically ascribed to breaks observed on the order of several hours to days after the prompt emission . in the case of a grb observed off - axis , @xmath152 , and therefore a break in the light curve occurs at a later time than is typically observed for on - axis grbs . assuming a jet opening angle of @xmath153 , @xcite modelled the resultant afterglow light curve observed from a grb viewed at various off - axis angles ,",
    "they found a viewing angle @xmath155 , close to the edge of the jet , produced a peak in the light curve at t @xmath156  s. any peak in the optical light curve of xrf  050406 occurred in the first few hundred seconds after the prompt @xmath1-ray emission . in an off - axis uniform jet model",
    "this would require an anomalously small jet opening angle , which causes difficulties in standard afterglow models and observations  @xcite .",
    "alternatively we consider a structured jet in which the energy @xmath157 and lorentz factor @xmath130 per unit solid angle is a decreasing function of angular distance from the centre @xmath143 .",
    "in such a model a softer spectrum can be observed for viewing angles @xmath158 , provided that they are close to the outer edges of the jet where the energy per solid unit angle is lower . from the onset",
    "the emission from material in the observer s line of sight will dominate over that produced within the jet core .",
    "the light curve is , therefore , primarily composed of a single decaying component from emission regions in the line of sight , with an underlying flux component originating from the core of the jet .",
    "the resultant light curve would be observed to decay from the start but at a slower rate than if observed on axis .",
    "this model is in good agreement with observations of xrf  050406 , which has a shallow optical decay index @xmath159 , and late time shallow x - ray decay index @xmath110 .",
    "another consequence of a structured jet model is a smoother prompt light curve . as in the case of the afterglow ,",
    "the prompt emission will be dominated by material along the line of sight . at large viewing angles strong variability in the lorentz factor",
    "is hard to produce  @xcite , causing internal shocks to be an inefficient source of radiation .",
    "external shocks are therefore expected to dominate the prompt emission and this produces a much smoother prompt light curve containing a single wide peak .",
    "this is indeed what is observed in the case of xrf  050406 .    within the universal structured jet model several jet morphologies",
    "have been explored with varying functional dependencies on the energy density and lorentz factor on the jet axis angle . a simple power - law structure , in which the energy varies with jet axis angle as @xmath160 , has difficulties reproducing the observed xrf , xrr burst , and grb distribution  @xcite , and greatly over - predicts the number of xrfs .",
    "@xcite addressed this by proposing a gaussian - like jet energy distribution .",
    "several other models have been explored , such as a jet with two or more components  @xcite .",
    "however a much greater data sample of bursts with early time observations is required before the range of possible jet morphologies can be narrowed down .",
    "it is important to note that an off - axis grb should appear less luminous than one observed on - axis as a result of a lower lorentz factor in the emission regions of the observed radiation .",
    "this is consistent with both optical and x - ray observations of xrf  050406 , which had optical and x - ray fluxes in the order of @xmath161  @xmath162  and @xmath163  @xmath162  at @xmath49  s after the prompt burst emission . as a reference ,",
    "this is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the bright burst grb  050525 at similar timescales after the prompt emission . @xcite",
    "have argued that an xrf s lower luminosity should limit their detectability to only modest redshifts ( z@xmath164 ) , so raising a question as to whether the best - fit redshift for xrf  050406 of @xmath125 is consistent with it being a grb viewed off - axis . the apparent paradox between the suggested off - axis viewing angle and redshift of xrf  050406 could be the cause of an intrinsically very luminous xrf , although the results of @xcite were reached on the basis of a grb having a uniform , rather than a structured jet .",
    "furthermore , with only small changes in the parameters of their model @xcite were able to extend the detectability of off - axis grbs to redshifts of up to @xmath165 .",
    "these included a decrease in the collimated jet angle down to angles @xmath166  rad , an increase in the assumed standard energy constant @xmath167 from @xmath168  @xmath44  to @xmath169  @xmath44 , a steeper high energy spectral index from -2.5 to -3 , and a modification of the spectral functional form of @xmath170 .      if xrfs do indeed have the same origin as grbs and xrr bursts they should follow the same empirical laws .",
    "it has been shown that the relation @xmath20",
    "@xcite , applicable to grbs , is also consistent with the @xmath18 limits for xrf  020903 and xrf  030723  @xcite , and recently xrf  050416a has also been shown to satisfy the relation  @xcite . at the best - fit redshift value of @xmath171",
    ", xrf  050406 has an equivalent isotropic energy of @xmath172  erg , which when using the amati relation , provides an estimated peak energy of @xmath173  kev in the observer frame .",
    "although the @xmath18 values from spectral fits to the prompt emission are not well constrained , they are consistent within errors to the estimated @xmath174 .",
    "this would give support to the hypothesis that grbs and xrfs form a continuum , and that a unified model is therefore necessary to explain both classes of bursts .",
    "we have presented early - time optical data for xrf  050406 , beginning 88  s after the burst trigger .",
    "this constitutes the earliest detection of an x - ray flash in the optical band to date .",
    "the properties of the light curve and spectrum constrain the possible models that explain the soft spectrum from the prompt emission .",
    "the lack of lyman absorption down to @xmath3    in the uv / optical spectrum provides a firm upper limit of @xmath4 on the redshift , and broadband spectral modelling yields a best - fit redshift @xmath105 , and spectral index @xmath104 .",
    "a fit to the optical light curve provides a decay rate of @xmath175 . combining this information with the prompt @xmath1-ray emission and x - ray afterglow",
    "we conclude that the soft spectrum observed in the initial emission from xrf  050406 is most likely the result of a grb with a structured jet observed off - axis .",
    "this model is able to account for the lack of a peak in the x - ray or optical afterglow in the order of @xmath176  s or later after the prompt emission , as well as the shallow decay rate observed in both energy bands .",
    "it also predicts a smooth prompt emission light curve .    in order to continue to further constrain the possible models that describe the origins of xrfs , further prompt observations of these objects are necessary .",
    "it is only during the early stages of emission , when the internal mechanisms that power these bursts are probed , that many of these models can be differentiated .",
    "it is also important to increase the sample of xrfs with spectroscopic redshifts to gain information on their rest - frame properties .",
    "the classification of bursts as x - ray flashes is based on observer frame properties .",
    "however , only knowledge of the rest - frame properties will reveal the underlying differences between xrfs , xrr bursts and grbs . at a redshift of @xmath171 xrf  050406",
    "would have a peak energy @xmath177  kev , at which stage there begins to be an overlap between the intrinsic properties of xrfs that are at redshifts @xmath178 and nearby grbs",
    ". continued prompt and deep observations of xrfs attainable with _ swift _ together with an increase in spectroscopic redshifts acquired from rapid follow - up ground - based observations promise to provide the data necessary to further constrain the possible origins of xrfs .",
