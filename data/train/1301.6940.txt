    "full continuum images at 535.7  nm ( bandwidth 0.5  nm ) are recorded by sodism @xcite every minute with a spatial resolution of about 1 square arcsecond on a @xmath1 ccd . for telemetry reasons ,",
    "these images are downgraded to @xmath2 pixels ( about 8x8 arcsecond ) by a simple onboard binning before being transmitted to ground .",
    "we have analyzed a dataset covering 209 consecutive days ( 2011/04/16 - 2011/11/10 ) with a duty cycle of @xmath3 .",
    "the gaps are mostly due to interruptions for the other picard program ( astrometric measurements at different wavelengths ) and to the crossing of the south atlantic anomaly , which is the location of transient signals generated by trapped protons exposing low - altitude , sun - synchronous orbiting satellites , like picard , to strong radiations .",
    "figure  [ fig : diags ] ( top ) shows the @xmath0-@xmath4 diagram obtained from this 209-day dataset for angular degree up to @xmath0=300 .",
    "as expected from the instrumental resolution , a spatial aliasing for spherical harmonics above @xmath0=200 is present .",
    "we can also see a temporal aliasing for frequencies above 4.5 mhz .",
    "this is the signature of a spurious cycle in the 2-min sampling slots corresponding to the astrometric program sequences .",
    "figure  [ fig : diags ] ( bottom ) illustrates a @xmath5-@xmath4 diagram for @xmath0=90 clearly showing the s - shape signature of the differential rotation .",
    "figure  [ fig : params ] shows the mode parameters modelled using the asymmetrical line profile formula of nigam and kosovichev @xcite and fitted using a maximum likelihood estimator minimization @xcite . for a given mode ( @xmath6,@xmath0 ) , the 2@xmath0 + 1 @xmath5-components of the multiplets are fitted simultaneously using an expansion on orthogonal polynomials @xcite with up to 9 so - called a - coefficients .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath5 mode leakages are included in the fitting process .",
    "positive peak asymmetries are obtained as expected from previous analyses of intensity signal .",
    "the @xmath7 splitting coefficients plotted as a function of the mode turning point proxy @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , exhibit a gradient which is a typical signature of the solar tachocline .",
    "improvements of the peak - fitting process are currently underway .",

    "symmetric part of the internal solar rotation rate with respect to the equator .",
    "iso - contours are shown every 10  nhz from 300  nhz up to 480  nhz .",
    "this was obtained by inverting the frequency splittings estimated from picard / sodism intensity images over the period from april 16 to november 10 2011 . the solution below 0.3@xmath10",
    "is poorly constrained by the data and is not shown . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : rot ] shows a regularized least - square ( rls ) inversion @xcite of the measured rotational splittings of 769 modes from @xmath0=1 to @xmath0=99 .",
    "the steep gradient of the tachocline at the base of the convection zone around 0.7  @xmath10 is clearly seen .",
    "the inferred rotation rate is similar to the one previously obtained from velocity data @xcite : a radial gradient is obtained close to the surface followed by a latitudinal differential rotation persisting through the whole convection zone .",
    "the radiative interior is roughly rigid at a rate of @xmath11  nhz which corresponds to the surface rate for latitudes between @xmath12 and @xmath13 degrees .",
    "finally , we note that a local maxima is found close to the equator near @xmath14 .",
    "these preliminary results are very encouraging .",
    "we are currently working in order to extend the peak - fitting analysis towards higher @xmath0 and to increase the number of fitted @xmath15-coefficients thus improving the resolution of our inversion .",
    "the reversal of peak asymmetry observed between velocity and intensity power spectra is linked to the effect of a background component correlated to the modes @xcite .",
    "the complete two years of picard observations available to date should then be used to confront the details of internal rotation studies obtained using simultaneous velocity and intensity data from sdo / hmi or gong . by fitting intensity , velocity , their phase difference and coherence signals simultaneously , we hope to nail down systematics in either observables and better understand the correlated background noise @xcite .",
    "this will help to better interpret the fitted frequencies and frequency splittings in terms of internal structure and dynamics .",
    "every 2 minutes , the full resolution of picard / sodism images are kept in an annulus of 22 pixels around the solar limb ( increased to 31 pixels since april 2012 ) . in april 2011 and april 2012 ,",
    "3 consecutive days were dedicated to helioseismic measurements at 535.7  nm without interruption for the other picard objectives . these datasets with a duty cycle above 95@xmath16 have been used in order to study the expected mode amplification at the extreme limb @xcite .",
    "intensity data from soho / mdi and sdo / hmi were also used for comparison .",

    "figure  [ fig : complnu ] shows the comparison between the @xmath0-@xmath4 diagram obtained from a classical spherical harmonic transform of full images ( left ) and the @xmath17-@xmath4 diagram ( right ) resulting from the limb transform as described above . a frequency shift between ridges of the same radial order",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "we carried out simulations in order to understand this shift and the link between the two diagrams @xcite .",
    "for a given @xmath17 , it can be shown that the limb response are non zero for value of @xmath0 higher than @xmath17 .",
    "since the mode frequencies increase with the degree , the leaks will appear at higher frequencies than the original anticipated frequency .",
    "the leaks will then appear as an asymmetry at higher frequency with a decreasing amplitude when @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is indeed what is shown in figure  [ fig : simu ] , where the observed ridge profiles obtained from picard / sodism and soho / mdi intensity data are compared to the simulated profiles . from these simulations , we are able to understand :    * why the peak in the @xmath17-@xmath4 diagram is shifted with @xmath0 ( the shift with the original @xmath0-@xmath4 ridge increases as @xmath0 increases ) ; * why the peak gets closer to the original ridge as we get closer to the limb ; * why the @xmath17-@xmath4 ridge leaks towards higher frequencies .",
    "figure  [ fig : amp ] ( left ) shows that the energy in the p - mode range peaks at the extreme limb , as was already seen using mdi intensity images @xcite or the guiding pixels of soho / loi @xcite . if we normalize this by a proxy of the noise level obtained by integrating the energy in the low - frequency band ( right panel ) , we can see that we effectively have an amplification of the signal - to - noise ratio at the extreme limb for the three instruments",
    "this peak is however slightly shifted inward for sodism .",
    "this may be an instrumental effect but this needs further investigations .",
    "the first helioseismic analyses of sodism full - continuum images have been carried out for both the medium-@xmath0 and limb programs .",
    "we fitted mode parameters for a wide range of eigenmodes .",
    "the fitted peak asymmetries and frequency splittings are consistent with what is known from previous studies .",
    "we performed a first inversion of the rotational splittings and infered the internal rotation rate down to the radiative zone .",
    "the steep gradient of the tachocline is clearly seen at the base of the convection zone .",
    "the signature of p - modes can also be observed in limb data and a signal amplification was detected at the extreme limb . by computing the response of any mode to the limb transform , we explain most of the features of the power spectra observed at the limb when compared to spectra built using full images . however , we have to face strong instrumental and orbital effects that affect both the photometric signal and the geometry of the solar images . we know from the past that our capacity in assessing the reliability of the details of many features analyzed using helioseismology ( tachocline shape , polar jet , meridional flows , surface effects for structure inversions , etc .",
    "see e.g. @xcite ) greatly benefit from the cross - analysis made using different instruments ( e.g. gong and soho / mdi ) .",
    "we are therefore still working on improving our calibration procedure and we hope that picard will be extended at least one year in order to gather more intensity data that can be compared and cross - calibrated with sdo / hmi intensity and velocity images .",
    "the data were provided by the picard / sodism , soho / mdi , and sdo / hmi instrument teams .",
