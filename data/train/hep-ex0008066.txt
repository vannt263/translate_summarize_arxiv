    "the accuracy in the determination of the @xmath7 element in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix  @xcite plays an important role in the study of the unitarity triangle and in the related tests of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "in particular , a non - vanishing @xmath7 is essential to preserve the possibility to describe cp violation within the sm and its value places a direct constraint on the magnitude of the cp violating phase @xmath10 .",
    "the first determination of the magnitude of @xmath7 was obtained from the yield of leptons produced with momentum above the kinematic limit for @xmath11 transitions , first reported by cleo  @xcite and soon confirmed by argus  @xcite .",
    "however this method is sensitive to only @xmath12  10% of the inclusive charmless semileptonic ( s.l . )",
    "yield , and the extraction of @xmath7 is subject to a large model dependence .",
    "more recently , exclusive @xmath13 and @xmath14 decays have been measured by cleo  @xcite . the determination of @xmath7 from exclusive s.l .",
    "decays has still a significant model dependence .",
    "first lattice estimates of the relevant form factors indicate that a significant reduction of these uncertainties may be expected in the future .",
    "the extraction of @xmath7 from the distribution of the invariant mass @xmath15 of the hadronic system recoiling against the lepton pair peaked , for @xmath1 , at a significantly lower value than for @xmath11 was proposed several years ago  @xcite , and it has recently been the subject of new theoretical calculations  @xcite . if @xmath4 transitions can be discriminated from the dominant @xmath3 background up to @xmath16 , this method is sensitive to @xmath12  80% of the charmless s.l .",
    "@xmath0 decay rate .",
    "further , if no preferential weight is given to low mass states in the event selection , the non - perturbative effects are expected to be small and the ope description of the transition has been shown to be accurate away from the resonance region .",
    "the experimental challenge comes from the requirement to isolate the @xmath4 contribution to the s.l .",
    "yield from the @xmath12  60 times larger @xmath3 one while ensuring a uniform sampling of the decay phase space to avoid biases towards a few exclusive low - mass , low - multiplicity states , such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in principle , this method is well suited for the lep experiments , where the recorded statistics is not sufficient for studying the exclusive decay modes with good accuracy while the significant boost of the @xmath0 hadrons , the separation of @xmath19 and @xmath20 decay products in opposite hemispheres , and the good secondary vertex reconstruction capabilities make the study of inclusive decay @xmath0 decays possible .",
    "the analysis techniques adopted by the aleph  @xcite , delphi  @xcite and l3  @xcite collaborations are based on the observation that @xmath1 decays can be inclusively discriminated from @xmath11 by exploiting the differences in the invariant mass and kaon content of the secondary hadronic system , in the decay multiplicity and in the decay vertex topology .",
    "these features have been used differently in the three analyses , resulting in determinations of the charmless s.l . branching fraction obtained from samples with varying efficiency and purity and with systematic uncertainties that are only partially correlated .",
    "the analyses consist of three main steps : i ) inclusive selection of s.l .",
    "@xmath0 decay candidates , ii ) definition of a subsample enriched in @xmath4 transitions and iii ) measurement of the charmless s.l . branching fraction .",
    "all experiments started from a sample of events containing an identified electron or muon selected from a combined data set of @xmath12 8.2  m hadronic @xmath21 decays .",
    "aleph and delphi also imposed @xmath19-tag criteria to reject light quark and charm backgrounds .",
    "aleph used two neural networks ( nn ) to separate charged and neutral @xmath0 decay products from fragmentation particles , reconstructed the secondary hadronic system and the @xmath0 rest frame and computed twenty @xmath4 discriminating kinematical variables in this frame .",
    "delphi also reconstructed the secondary hadronic system mass and the @xmath0 rest frame , but using a particle likelihood variable and an iterative topological reconstruction procedure and estimated the lepton energy in the @xmath0 rest frame @xmath22 for each event .",
    "l3 adopted a consecutive cut analysis based on the kinematics of the two most energetic hadrons in the same hemisphere as the tagged lepton .",
    "all the three experiments observed a significant excess of events with the characteristics expected for @xmath23 decays .",
    "aleph combined the selected discriminating variables by means of another nn to obtain a global discriminant variable nn@xmath24 ( see figure  [ fig : aleph ] ) .",
    "the number of @xmath1 candidates in the data was extracted by a binned likelihood fit to the nn@xmath24 and converted into the charmless s.l .",
    "delphi divided the reconstructed events in four classes on the basis of the @xmath15 value and of enrichment criteria based on the relative position of the lepton w.r.t .",
    "the secondary vertex and the presence of tagged kaons . of these classes",
    "the @xmath25 1.6  gev/@xmath26 - @xmath4 enriched one was expected to contain almost 70% of the s.l .",
    "@xmath4 decays while the other classes , depleted of signal events , were used to monitor the background modeling in the simulation ( see figure  [ fig : delphi ] ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath27 was extracted , together with the overall data / mc normalization , from the fraction of @xmath1 candidates observed in the data using a two parameter likelihood fit to the number of events in each of the four classes and to their @xmath22 distributions .",
    "finally l3 extracted the charmless s.l .",
    "@xmath0 branching fraction by counting the excess of events over the estimated background after having applied their selection criteria .    starting from a natural signal - to - background ratio , s / b , of about 0.02 , aleph obtained s / b = 0.07 with an efficiency @xmath28 11% , delphi s / b = 0.10 with @xmath28 6.5% and l3",
    "s / b = 0.16 with @xmath28 1.5% .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : summary ] .",
    "several consistency checks were performed by the three experiments .",
    "aleph explicitly used vertexing variables , delphi performed a search for fully reconstructed @xmath13 , @xmath18 decays and l3 validated the excess of events by constructing a @xmath4 discriminating nn ( see figure  [ fig : l3 ] ) .",

    "the sources of correlated systematics belong to both the description of background @xmath3 and to the modeling of signal @xmath4 transitions .",
    "the differences in the analysis techniques adopted by the three experiments are reflected by differences in the sizes of the systematic uncertainties estimated from each common source .",
    "important common systematics are due to the charm topological branching ratios and to the rate of @xmath35 decays .",
    "aleph and l3 are also sensitive to the uncertainties in the @xmath19 fragmentation function due to the use of kinematical variables for enriching in @xmath1 .",
    "the delphi result depends on the assumed composition in @xmath19 hadron species due to the use of kaon anti - tagging to reject @xmath3 , thus rejecting also @xmath36 and @xmath37 decays .",
    "the signal @xmath4 systematics have been grouped in _ inclusive model _ and _ exclusive model _ and assumed to be fully correlated .",
    "the first corresponds to the uncertainty in modeling the kinematics of the @xmath19-quark in the heavy hadron .",
    "it has been estimated from the spread of the results obtained with the accmm model  @xcite , a shape function , describing the distribution of the light - cone residual momentum of the heavy quark inside the hadron  @xcite and the parton model  @xcite in the aleph and delphi analyses and from the uncertainties in the single @xmath38 and the lepton energy spectra for l3 . the _ exclusive model _",
    "uncertainty arises from the modeling of the hadronic final state in the @xmath1 decay .",
    "these uncertainties have been estimated by replacing the parton shower fragmentation model in jetset  @xcite with the fully exclusive isgw2  @xcite model by aleph and delphi and by propagating a 100% uncertainty on the @xmath13 rate by l3 . using the inputs from table  [ tab : summary ] , the lep average value for br(@xmath1 )",

    "the value of the @xmath7 element has been extracted by using the following relationship derived in the context of heavy quark expansion  @xcite @xmath39 with @xmath40 where the value @xmath41 = ( 4.58 @xmath2 0.06 )  gev / c@xmath42 has been assumed  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties have been convoluted together assuming them to be gaussian in br(@xmath1 ) , with the exception of the theoretical uncertainty on @xmath43 assumed to be gaussian in @xmath7 .",

    "this result agrees with the recent cleo determination  @xcite using the exclusive @xmath14 decay branching fraction giving @xmath50 where the uncertainty is dominated by a 17% model systematic mostly uncorrelated with that of the lep measurement .",
