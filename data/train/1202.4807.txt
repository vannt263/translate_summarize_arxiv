    "the general theory of relativity ( gr ) based on the einstein@xmath2hilbert action can not explain the acceleration of the early and late universe .",
    "therefore , gr does not describe precisely gravity and it is reasonable to modify it in such a way that the theory admits the inflation and imitates the dark energy .",
    "in addition , the mach principle is not included in gr . thus , the economical strategy is not to introduce extra fields to resolve the cosmological problems but to modify the einstein@xmath2hilbert action by introducing proper @xmath5-gravity .",
    "such theory can describe the inflation and dark energy or , in other words , the early - time inflation and late - time acceleration , and can solve the cosmological constant problem .",
    "it should be noted that the modified gravity ( @xmath5-gravity ) is the phenomenological model describing local tests and observational data .",
    "gr was tested in the solar system in weak - field and slow motion approximation but at the scale of galaxies and clusters and strong gravity has been tested with poor accuracy .",
    "the fundamental theory of relativity has to be the renormalizable quantum gravity which may describe quantum of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "corrections introduced by renormalization are quadratic in scalar curvature and are realized in @xmath6-gravity but not , in general , in non - linear @xmath5-gravity .",
    "there are difficulties to quantize @xmath5-gravity because it is the higher derivative ( hd ) theory . in hd theories",
    "there are additional degrees of freedom and ghosts present so that unitarity of the theory is questionable .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath5-gravity can resolve the coincidence problem , explains the existence of dark matter , and gives detailed account of the transition from deceleration to acceleration @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not investigate the cosmological perturbations because within @xmath5-gravity , which is the hd theory , the perturbation theory has not been constructed yet .",
    "@xmath5-gravity can be reformulated in a scalar - tensor form and scalar fields may play the role of dark matter .",
    "it should be mentioned that the string theory at low energy gives a scalar - tensor ( brans@xmath2dicke ) theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we formulate a model of modified gravity with the born@xmath2infeld - like lagrangian density .",
    "we obtain a bound on the parameter @xmath1 with the dimension ( length)@xmath7 . static solutions corresponding to de sitter phase with matter ( @xmath8 ) and without matter are obtained in sec.3 . in sec.4 , we describe frw cosmology when the universe accelerates . the scalar - tensor form of the model is considered and the potential of the scalar field is obtained in sec.5 .",
    "we demonstrate that the de sitter space is unstable and a solution with zero curvature scalar is stable .",
    "the cosmological scenario is described . in sec.6",
    "the matter stability in the model is investigated and we show that there is no matter instability . the summary of results obtained is presented in conclusion .",
    "we use the minkowski metric of the form @xmath9=diag(-1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) and assume that the speed of light @xmath10 and planck s constant @xmath11 to be unity .",
    "greek indices run 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 and latin indices run the spatial values 1 , 2 , 3 .",
    "let us consider @xmath5-gravity with the lagrangian density @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the planck mass . other variants of born@xmath2infeld type gravity were considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from equation ( 1 ) that the scalar curvature has to obey the restriction @xmath15 .",
    "one can say that the smallest size of the universe ( during the big bang ) can not be less than @xmath16 . implying that the constant @xmath1 with the dimension of ( length)@xmath7 is small , @xmath17 , we obtain from ( 1 ) the taylor series @xmath18 thus , at small value of the constant @xmath1 introduced , one comes to the einstein@xmath2hilbert action @xmath19 ( @xmath20=det@xmath21 ) , as @xmath22 . because gr passes local tests the model under consideration also satisfies observational data at the definite bound on @xmath1 .",
    "the laboratory bound from the et - wash experiment @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) gives @xmath23 @xmath4 . from equation ( 1 ) , we obtain a restriction on the parameter @xmath1 : @xmath24 the taylor series ( 2 ) contains all powers in ricci curvature @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the ricci tensor ) . at small @xmath1 series ( 2 )",
    "gives the approximate lagrangian density @xmath27 which was already considered in @xcite .",
    "such model , which was motivated to be renormalizable , results in the self - consistent inflation .",
    "@xmath6-term in this lagrangian prevents from the singular behavior in the past and in the future @xcite .    adding to ( 1 ) the lagrangian of the matter which is the perfect fluid with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is a pressure , @xmath30 is the energy density , and the four - velocity of the fluid obeys @xmath31 ) , one obtains equations of motion @xcite , @xcite    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a covariant derivative , @xmath34 .",
    "the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath35 gives the equation ( for friedmann@xmath2robertson@xmath2walker ( frw ) metric ) as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the hubble parameter , a(t ) is a scale factor and a dot above the variable denotes the differentiation with respect to the time . at the particular case when the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath38 , corresponding to the fluid with the property of the dark energy , the energy density @xmath30 becomes constant .",
    "now , we solve equation ( 4 ) for a novel lagrangian density ( 1 ) in a particular case when the ricci scalar is a constant @xmath39 .",
    "we also specify eos : @xmath40 with constant @xmath30 . for constant curvature ,",
    "equation ( 4 ) becomes @xmath41 solutions to equation ( 6 ) are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "we notice that for our model @xmath44 and the regime of antigravity @xmath45 is not realized .",
    "in addition , the condition of classical stability for schwarzschild black holes @xmath46 @xcite , @xcite leads to @xmath47 , i.e. the constant @xmath1 is positive , @xmath48 ( and @xmath49 ) . to have the real value of the scalar @xmath50 in the solution ( 7 )",
    ", the discriminant should be positive : @xmath51 .",
    "this inequality possesses two solutions @xmath52 according to the solar system test the constant @xmath1 has to be small and , therefore , we obtain the bound on the constant @xmath1 from the first inequality in ( 8) : @xmath53 for the region inside the earth @xmath54 ev@xmath55 , and using @xmath56 ev , we see that the condition ( 9 ) can be easily satisfied due to equation ( 3 ) . without the matter when @xmath57 , @xmath58 the parameter @xmath59 and solutions ( 7 ) read @xmath60 it is interesting that at @xmath61 from equation ( 7 ) , one has the same solutions ( 10 ) as for free space . for a particular case",
    "@xmath62 solutions ( 7 ) are degenerated and we arrive at @xmath63 it follows from ( 7 ) that if @xmath64 , we have two solutions for @xmath50 which are positive @xmath65 . thus , both of the solutions lead to the de sitter space , and we have probably the unification of early - time inflation with late - time acceleration .",
    "let us consider the spherically symmetric metric with the schwarzschild form @xmath66 then for eos @xmath40 and constant ricci scalar @xmath50 all @xmath5 theories admit schwarzschild@xmath2(anti-)de sitter solutions @xcite , @xcite with the function @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath69 is newton s constant .",
    "if @xmath65 , we have the de sitter space and for @xmath70 , one has the anti - de sitter space .",
    "according to equation ( 7 ) the solutions for the ricci scalar are positive @xmath71 and , therefore , in our model for a constant curvature the de sitter space is realized . for a free space , without the matter ( @xmath58 , @xmath57 ) , the non - trivial solution ( 10 ) @xmath72 gives the function ( 13 ) : @xmath73 thus , the classical stability for schwarzschild black holes leads again to @xmath48 .",
    "comparison of solution ( 14 ) with the solution of einstein s equation with cosmological constant @xmath74 leads to equality @xmath75 .",
    "this means that the model suggested mimics the cosmological constant ( or the dark energy ) for the space without any matter .",
    "this is the common property of @xmath5 models @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the entropy @xmath76 in @xmath5-gravity is given by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the area of the horizon . from equation ( 1 )",
    ", one finds @xmath79 it follows from ( 16 ) that instead of newton constant @xmath80 , one can introduce the effective gravitational coupling @xmath81 .",
    "for the nontrivial solution ( 10 ) ( @xmath72 ) , we arrive at the effective gravitational constant @xmath82 .",
    "in homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat frw cosmology the space - time metric is given by @xmath83 the scalar curvature r is expressed via the the hubble parameter as follows : @xmath84 . in this case equation ( 4 ) reduces to a system of two equations @xcite    @xmath85    @xmath86    for static solutions @xmath87 and these two equations are consistent with eos @xmath88 and reduce to equation ( 6 ) .",
    "then @xmath89 and from equation ( 10 ) , one obtains @xmath90 for a de sitter phase . as a result",
    "a scale factor becomes @xmath91 and describes the inflation phase .",
    "there is a link between modified @xmath5-gravity and scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite , @xcite .",
    "equation ( 1 ) presents modified gravity in the jordan frame with metric tensor variables @xmath21 .",
    "let us consider the einstein frame with conformally transformed metric @xcite @xmath92 then , in new variables ( 21 ) , equation ( 1 ) becomes @xmath93 where @xmath94 is defined in new metric ( 21 ) .",
    "we have introduced the scalar field @xmath95 and the potential @xmath96 as follows : @xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "the plot of the function ( 24 ) is presented in fig.[fig.1 ] .",
    "@xmath100 versus @xmath101 .",
    "there is maximum at @xmath102 and minimum at @xmath103.,width=288,height=192 ]    the potential function ( 24 ) possesses minimum at @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) and maximum at @xmath102 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "we find that for static solutions ( 10 ) the value @xmath106 corresponds to the minimum and @xmath72 corresponds to the maximum of the potential .",
    "thus , the zero scalar curvature is the stable state and the state with ricci scalar @xmath72 is unstable . from potential ( 24 )",
    ", we obtain the mass of a scalar state @xmath107 it follows from ( 25 ) that @xmath108 for @xmath106 ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath109 for @xmath72 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "thus , the solution with constant curvature @xmath72 leads to unstable de sitter space ( 12 ) , ( 14 ) .",
    "but the solution with zero scalar curvature @xmath106 gives the condition @xmath110 for a stability of the schwarzschild solution ( 13 ) ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "as the constant @xmath1 is small the squared mass @xmath111 is big and corrections to the newton law are negligible .",
    "one can describe the cosmological scenario as follows .",
    "the universe starts with the large finite positive curvature @xmath112 ( because the parameter @xmath1 is small ) corresponding to the field @xmath113",
    ". then the universe inflates and has the positive curvature @xmath72 being in de sitter s phase .",
    "this state is unstable and the universe rapidly expands with the hubble parameter @xmath89 ( for the constant @xmath50 ) which defines the expansion rate @xmath114 of the de sitter space",
    ". then the scalar curvature decreases ( rolls down ) and becomes small so that the rate of the expansion @xmath115 is small .",
    "the final state is stable and corresponds to the vanishing ricci curvature @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the universe approaches stable minkowski space .",
    "we have described the behavior of the scalar potential of our modified gravity model with the lagrangian density ( 1 ) .",
    "now we consider the equation of motion for a curvature scalar . taking the trace of left and right sides of equation ( 4 ) , one obtains @xmath116 where @xmath117 . to investigate the matter stability , we follow @xcite , and apply equation ( 26 ) for weak gravity objects .",
    "the flat minkowski metric can be used for weak gravitation so that @xmath118 . for spatially constant distribution ( @xmath119 is uniform ) equation ( 26 ) becomes @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "we consider a perturbative solution @xmath122 ( @xmath123 is the perturbed part , @xmath124 ) , where in the lowest order the curvature , according to gr , is @xmath125 inside the matter and @xmath126 outside the matter . from equation ( 27 )",
    ", one obtains ( see @xcite )    @xmath127}{3f^{(2)}(r_0)}=u(r_0)r_1 , \\label{28}\\ ] ]    where @xmath128    the system is unstable if @xmath129 because @xmath123 exponentially increases in the time .",
    "we find that for our model ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) the function @xmath130 is given by @xmath131 one can verify that for static solutions ( 10 ) @xmath132 that indicates on stability of the system . even for the least value of the scalar curvature @xmath133",
    ", we have @xmath132 . as a result",
    ", there is no matter instability and the model passes the matter stability test .",
    "thus , a modified theory of gravity with the born@xmath2infeld - like action is suggested and analyzed . at limiting case @xmath134",
    "the action introduced is converted into einstein@xmath2hilbert action .",
    "the jordan frame as well as the einstein frame were considered and the potential of the scalar field in scalar - tensor form of the theory was obtained and is presented in fig.1 .",
    "we have found the static schwarzschild@xmath2de sitter solutions of the model with the de sitter space to be unstable and the solution with zero ricci scalar to be stable .",
    "the constant @xmath1 introduced can be connected with the fundamental length @xmath135 so that the smallest size of the universe during the big bang is @xmath136 . from the local tests bound on the constant @xmath3 @xmath4 , and we obtain the restriction on the fundamental length @xmath137 cm . it was demonstrated that no matter instability in the model suggested .",
