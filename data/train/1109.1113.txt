    "in the last years bacteriophage therapies are attracting the attention of several scientific studies .",
    "they can be a new and powerful tool to treat bacterial infections or to prevent them applying the treatment to animals such as poultry or swine .",
    "very roughly speaking , they consist in inoculating a ( benign ) virus in order to kill the bacteria known to be responsible of a certain disease .",
    "this kind of treatment is known since the beginning of the 20th century , but has been in disuse in the western world , erased by antibiotic therapies .",
    "however , a small activity in this domain has survived in the ussr , and it is now re - emerging ( at least at an experimental level ) . among the reasons of this re - emersion we can find the progressive slowdown in antibiotic efficiency ( antibiotic resistance ) .",
    "reported recent experiments include animal diseases like hemorrhagic septicemia in cattle or atrophic rhinitis in swine , and a need for suitable mathematical models is now expressed by the community .",
    "let us be a little more specific about the ( lytic ) bacteriophage mechanism : after attachment , the virus genetic material penetrates into the bacteria and use the host s replication mechanism to self - replicate .",
    "once this is done , the bacteria is completely spoiled while new viruses are released , ready to attack other bacteria . it should be noticed at this point that among the advantages expected from the therapy is the fact that it focuses on one specific bacteria , while antibiotics also attack autochthonous microbiota .",
    "roughly speaking , it is also believed that viruses are likely to adapt themselves to mutations of their host bacteria .    at a mathematical level , whenever the mobility of the different biological actors is high enough , bacteriophage systems can be modeled by a kind of predator - prey equation .",
    "namely , set @xmath0 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1 ) for the bacteria ( resp .",
    "bacteriophages ) concentration at time  @xmath2 .",
    "consider a truncated identity function @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 , @xmath5 whenever @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 . then a model for the evolution of the couple @xmath9 is as follows : @xmath10s_t{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t\\\\ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}q_t & = \\left[d - mq_t - k \\sigma(q_{t})s_{t}+k \\ , b \\ , e^{-\\mu { \\zeta } } \\sigma(q_{t-{\\zeta}})s_{t-{\\zeta}}\\right]{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t , \\end{aligned } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the reproducing rate of the bacteria and @xmath12 is the adsorption rate . in equation ( [ e : truncada2 ] ) , @xmath13 also stands for the quantity of bacteriophages inoculated per unit of time , @xmath14 is their death rate , we denote by @xmath15 the number of bacteriophages which is released after replication within the bacteria cell , @xmath16 is the delay necessary to the reproduction of bacteriophages ( called latency time ) and the coefficient @xmath17 represents an attenuation in the release of bacteriophages ( given by the expected number of bacteria cell s deaths during the latency time , where @xmath18 is the bacteria s death rate ) .",
    "a given initial condition @xmath19 is also specified .",
    "when modeling biological phenomena , one usually assumes models like ( [ e : truncada2 ] ) , where @xmath20 is replaced by the identity function .",
    "we have considered here the truncation of the identity @xmath20 in order to manipulate bounded coefficients in our equations , but our parameter @xmath21 can also be interpreted as a maximal infection rate of bacteria by bacteriophages .",
    "one should also be aware of the fact that the latency time @xmath22 ( which can be seen as the reproduction time of the bacteriophages within the bacteria ) can not be neglected , and is generally of the same order ( about 20mn ) as the experiment length ( about 60mn ) .    according to the values of the different parameters of the system and of the initial conditions , different types of equilibriums for equation ( [ e : truncada2 ] ) might emerge .",
    "we shall focus in the sequel on the simplest of these regimes , namely when @xmath13 is large enough ( the exact condition is @xmath23 ) .",
    "this makes the mathematical analysis easier , and it corresponds to the existence of a unique stable steady state @xmath24 for our system ( in particular bacteria have been eradicated ) .",
    "notice however that we can perfectly assume the regime @xmath23 since the treatment allows to inject high quantities of viruses .",
    "one should also mention a natural generalization of our problem : consider the action of several varieties bacteriophages , which is an option widely considered among practitioners .",
    "we have restricted our analysis here to a simplified situation for sake of readability .",
    "it is perfectly assumable that noise will appear when collecting data from laboratory tests .",
    "moreover , when one wishes to go from in vitro to in vivo modeling , it is commonly accepted that noisy versions of the differential systems at stake have to be considered .",
    "this program has been carried out e.g. for hiv dynamics in @xcite and for bacteriophages in marine organisms in @xcite . in those references",
    "it is always assumed that the noise enters in a bilinear way , which is quite natural in this situation and ensures positivity of the solution .",
    "we shall take up this strategy here , and consider system ( [ e : truncada2 ] ) with a small random perturbation of the form @xmath25s_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t + { \\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}\\sigma(s_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}})\\circ{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}w^1_t\\\\ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}q_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon } } & = \\left[d - mq_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}-k \\sigma(q_{t}^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}})s_{t}^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}+k \\ , b \\",

    "our aim will then be to prove that for a time @xmath29 within a reasonable range , the couple @xmath30 is not too far away from its stable equilibrium @xmath31 .",
    "note that _ reasonable range _ is meant here as a time which corresponds to the order of both the latency delay and the time when the immune system of the animal can cope with the remaining bacteria .    as we shall see in the sequel ,",
    "the treatment of equation involves the introduction of some rather technical assumptions on our coefficients .",
    "for sake of readability , we have thus decided to handle first the following system without delay : @xmath32s_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t + { \\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}\\sigma(s_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}})\\circ{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}w^1_t\\\\ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}q_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon } } & = \\left[d - mq_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}+k(b-1)\\sigma(q_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}})s_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}\\right]{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t + { \\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}\\sigma(q_t^{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}})\\circ{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}w^2_t , \\end{aligned } \\right.\\ ] ] where we notice that the only difference between and is that we have set @xmath33 in the latter .",
    "the main advantage of equation lies into the fact that we are able to work under the following rather simple set of assumptions :    [ hyp : coeff - sde ] we will suppose that the coefficients of equation ( [ e : truncada ] ) satisfy :    _ ( i ) _ the initial condition @xmath19 of the system lies into the region @xmath34\\times[d / m , m].\\ ] ]    _ ( ii ) _ the coefficient @xmath35 is strictly positive and @xmath36 .",
    "we shall also use extensively the following notations :    the letters @xmath37 will stand for universal constants , whose exact value is irrelevant . for a continuous function @xmath38",
    ", we set @xmath39 .",
    "then the previous loose considerations about convergence to @xmath31 can be summarized in the following theorem , which is the main result of our paper for our bacteriophage system without delay :    [ thm : concentration - equilibrium ] given positive initial conditions , equation ( [ e : truncada ] ) admits a unique solution which is almost surely an element of @xmath40 .",
    "assume furthermore hypothesis [ hyp : coeff - sde ] , set @xmath41 and consider 3 constants @xmath42 .",
    "then there exists @xmath43 such that for any @xmath44 and any interval of time of the form @xmath45 $ ] , we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant satisfying @xmath48 .    relation ( [ eq : concentration - equilibrium ] ) can be interpreted in the following manner : assume that we observe a noise with intensity @xmath49 .",
    "then the kind of deviation we might expect from the noisy system ( [ e : truncada ] ) with respect to the equilibrium @xmath31 is of order @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "this range of deviation happens at a time scale of order @xmath52 .    a second part of our analysis",
    "is then devoted to the more realistic delayed system , for which we obtain a result which is analogous to theorem [ thm : concentration - equilibrium ] :    [ thm : concentration - equilibrium - delayed ] equation still holds for the delayed system , under some slightly more restrictive conditions on the initial condition which shall be specified at hypothesis  [ hyp : coeff - delay ] .",
    "theorem [ thm : concentration - equilibrium - delayed ] can be seen as the main result of the current paper , and deserves some additional comments :    * ( 1 ) * we have produced a concentration type result instead of a large deviation principle for equation ( [ e : truncada ] ) , because it seemed more adapted to our biological context . indeed , in the current situation one wishes to know how far we might be from the desired equilibrium at a given fixed time , instead of producing asymptotic results as in the large deviation theory . at a technical level",
    "however , we rely on large deviation type tools , and in particular on an extensive use of exponential inequalities for martingales .    * ( 2 ) * let us compare our result with @xcite , which deal with closely related systems .",
    "the interesting article @xcite is concerned with a predator - prey system similar to ours , but it assumes that a linearization procedure around equilibrium in the highly nonlinear situation  ( [ e : truncada ] ) can be performed .",
    "the analysis relies then heavily on this unjustified step .",
    "as far as @xcite is concerned , it roughly shows that if the noise intensity of the system is high enough , then hiv epidemics can be kept under control ( in terms of exponential stability ) .",
    "this is a valuable information , but far away from our point of view which assumes a low intensity for the noise .",
    "we should also mention the related thorough deterministic studies  @xcite    * ( 3 ) * mathematically speaking , it would certainly be interesting to play with the rich picture produced by equation ( [ e : truncada2 ] ) and its perturbed version in terms of stable and instable equilibrium .",
    "we have not delved deeper into this direction because it did not seem directly relevant to the biological problem at stake .",
    "it should be pointed out however that the analysis of our random dynamical system is non standard due to the coefficient @xmath13 , which accounts for the bacteriophage inoculation .",
    "many of our considerations below will be devoted to handle this problem .",
    "our article is structured as follows : section [ sec : preliminaries ] is devoted to some preliminary considerations ( existence and uniqueness results for our stochastic systems , convergence to equilibrium for the corresponding deterministic equations ) .",
    "then we show our concentration results at section [ sec : fluctuations ] .",
    "finally some simulations are lead at section [ sec : numerics ] in order to illustrate the theoretical results .",
    "in this section , we give some basic results concerning our competition system .",
    "we first establish existence and uniqueness for the solution to the perturbed system ( [ e : truncada - delayed ] ) , starting from the simpler system ( [ e : truncada ] ) .",
    "then we deduce some properties for the equilibria of the deterministic counterpart of both systems and ( [ e : truncada ] ) .",
    "recall that we are considering the perturbed problem ( [ e : truncada - delayed ] ) , with a coefficient @xmath20 and some initial conditions of the following form :    [ hyp : sigma ] the coefficients of our differential systems satisfy the following assumptions :    _ ( i ) _ the function @xmath3 is such that @xmath4 , and satisfies @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath53 for all @xmath54 , with a constant @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .    _",
    "( ii ) _ as far as the initial condition is concerned , we assume that it is given as continuous positive functions @xmath57 . in case of the non delayed system  ,",
    "it is simply given by two positive constants @xmath19 .",
    "due to the fact that we have assumed a bounded coefficient @xmath20 , the existence and uniqueness of the solution to our differential system is a matter of standard considerations .    for any positive initial condition there",
    "exists a unique solution of , which is defined for all @xmath58 .",
    "it is readily checked that the coefficients of the equation are locally lipschitz with linear growth .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of the solution is then a direct consequence of classical results ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) for the non delayed system and @xcite for the delayed one ) .",
    "positivity of the solution is also an important feature , if we want the quantities @xmath59 to be biologically meaningful .",
    "moreover , part of our analysis will rely on this property , that we label for further use :    [ prop : positivity - sq ] if we take positive initial conditions @xmath60 , @xmath61 for all @xmath62 $ ] for the system , then the solution fulfills @xmath63 , @xmath64 for all @xmath65 .    let us first consider the system with @xmath66 for all @xmath67 , namely : @xmath68s_t^{{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}}{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t + { \\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}s_t^{{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}}\\circ{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}w^1_t\\\\ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}q_t^{{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon } } } & = \\left[d - mq_t^{{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}}-kq_t^{{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}}s_t^{{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}}}+k \\ , b \\",

    ", we shall prove that @xmath70 for all @xmath58 almost surely .",
    "indeed , after the change of variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 , we can recast into the following system of differential equations with random coefficients : @xmath73 with initial conditions @xmath74 , @xmath75 for all @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "then , the positivity of @xmath76 is immediate from the representation @xmath77    in order to see the positivity of @xmath78 let us observe that for @xmath79 we have @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , for all initial condition @xmath81 there exists @xmath82 such that @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",
    "let us suppose now that @xmath85 for some @xmath65 , and let @xmath86 .",
    "due to the continuity of the solution we have that @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath88 , which is impossible since it would yield @xmath83 for @xmath89 for @xmath90 small enough .",
    "this contradiction means exactly that @xmath91 for all @xmath58 .",
    "now that we have the positivity for system , we can prove the positivity for in the following way .",
    "let us first handle the case of @xmath92 , and assume that the initial condition is such that @xmath93 .",
    "set then @xmath94 and observe that @xmath95 is a stopping time for the natural filtration of the brownian motion @xmath96 , such that @xmath97 has remained positive until @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , the strong markov property for @xmath98 entails that the process @xmath99 also satisfies on the set @xmath100 , with an initial condition @xmath101 . with these considerations in mind",
    ", we can assume that the initial condition of our differential system satisfies @xmath102 .",
    "with such an initial condition we can conclude the positivity of @xmath92 until the stopping time @xmath103 as we have done for the system , since up to time @xmath104 we have @xmath105 .",
    "then , invoking again the strong markov property , we can also guarantee positivity until time @xmath106 as above .",
    "we are now in a position to obtain the positivity of @xmath92 until time @xmath107 , once again with the same reasoning than for the system .",
    "the global positivity of @xmath108 on any interval of the form @xmath109 $ ] for @xmath110 now follows by iteration of this reasoning .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath111 .",
    "this is easily obtained by combining the following two ingredients :    _ ( i ) _ the increments @xmath112 form a i.i.d sequence by a simple application of the strong markov property .    _",
    "( ii ) _ owing to the specific coefficients we have for equation , it can be checked that for any @xmath113 one can find @xmath114 small enough such that @xmath115 .",
    "details of this assertion are omitted for sake of conciseness .",
    "we let the reader check that the positivity of @xmath116 can be obtained along the same lines , which ends the proof .",
    "using the a priori positivity properties stated above , we could have also obtained existence and uniqueness of the solution for system ( [ e : sq1 ] ) .",
    "we did not include those developments for sake of conciseness .",
    "this section is devoted to the analysis of the non perturbed system corresponding to ( [ e : truncada ] ) .",
    "namely , we shall consider the following dynamical system : @xmath117s_t{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t\\\\ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}q_t & = \\left[d - mq_t+k(b-1)\\sigma(q_t)s_t\\right]{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t . \\end{aligned } \\right.\\ ] ] we will give some sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique stable equilibrium @xmath31 and then show exponential convergence to this equilibrium .",

    "moreover , the bacteria - free equilibrium @xmath31 is asymptotically stable for @xmath122 and @xmath123 .    to obtain the equilibria , we have to find the solutions of the following equation : @xmath124 where @xmath125 , @xmath126 are positive constants .",
    "owing to the first equation we have either @xmath127 or @xmath128 .",
    "since @xmath127 and the second equation imply @xmath129 , we have that bacteria - free equilibrium @xmath31 exists for any value of the parameters . in the case",

    "then , using the second equation in , we have @xmath134 which is positive only for @xmath135 .",
    "so we have proved the first part of the result .",
    "for the second part , the jacobian matrix of system at @xmath31 is @xmath136 the eigenvalues of this matrix are easily shown to be @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which are negative for @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we now wish to study the rate of convergence towards the @xmath31 equilibrium in the stable case ( i.e. , when @xmath139 and @xmath123 ) .",
    "the main result we obtain to this respect is :    [ thm : exp - cvgce - deterministic - nodelay ] under hypothesis [ hyp : coeff - sde ] and [ hyp : sigma ] , the solution of system with initial condition @xmath140\\times[d / m , m]\\ ] ] exponentially converges to the equilibrium @xmath31 : @xmath141 where we recall that @xmath142 .    in order to prove our claim",

    "this leads to the system    @xmath147    notice that , according to our set of assumptions concerning the initial conditions , we have @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "thus the solution to ( [ e : sq_origin ] ) will remain positive for all @xmath65 ( it can be deduced from @xmath150 being invariant , or can be proved just like in proposition [ prop : positivity - sq ] ) .",

    "owing to the second equation in ( [ e : sq_origin ] ) and using positivity properties of the solution , we also get @xmath154    finally , the variation of constants method will lead to the stated result , following the same steps we will detail later in the proof of theorem [ thm : exp - cvgce - deterministic ] .",
    "we now try to generalize the results of section [ sec : determ - non - delayed ] to our deterministic delayed system . to this aim",
