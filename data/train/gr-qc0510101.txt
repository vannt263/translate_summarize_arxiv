    "it plays also an important role in a study of radiative properties of gravitational fields .",
    "namely , in the case of nonvanishing cosmological constant it may provide us with an insight into the character of radiation , which in the asymptotically nontrivial spacetimes is not yet well understood . in refs .",

    "the parameter @xmath52 defines a range of the angular coordinate @xmath54 , and thus it governs a regularity of the @xmath29 symmetry axis .",
    "typically , the axis has a conical singularity which corresponds to a string or strut . by an appropriate choice of @xmath52 , a part of the axis",
    "can be made regular .",

    "objects on the axis are physically responsible for the of black holes .    the constant @xmath6 parametrizes the acceleration of the black holes .",
    "but it is not a simple task to define what it is the _ acceleration _ of a black hole .",
    "the acceleration of a test particle is defined with respect of a local inertial frame given by a background spacetime .",
    "however , black holes are objects which deform the spacetime in which they are moving ; they define the notion of inertial observers , and they are actually dragging inertial frames with themselves . therefore , it is not possible to measure the acceleration of black holes with respect to their surroundings .",
    "the motion of black holes can be partially deduced from a structure of the whole spacetime , e.g. , from a relation of black holes and asymptotically free observers , and partially by investigating a weak field limit in which the black holes become test particles and cease to deform the spacetime around them .",
    "namely , in the limit of vanishing mass and charge , the spacetime reduces to the anti - de  sitter universe with black holes changed into worldlines of uniformly accelerated particles .",
