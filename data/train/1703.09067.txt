    "it is well - established the non - existence of two - body bound states made of neutrons and/or @xmath5 s , the lightest hyperon .",
    "the situation is much more cumbersome for three- , four- and in general few - body systems made of nucleons and hyperons  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been proposed that dineutrons could become bound in the presence of additional nucleons  @xcite .",
    "this is the mechanism responsible for the properties of some bound nuclei that have a neutron excess , like @xmath6li , where a pair of external neutrons form a remote halo around the core of @xmath7li  @xcite .",
    "such possibility has been recently drawn in a lighter system by the experimental hyphi collaboration  @xcite , suggesting the existence of a neutral bound state of two neutrons and a @xmath5 hyperon , @xmath8 .",
    "they analyze the experimental data obtained from the reaction @xmath9li + @xmath10c at 2a gev to study the invariant mass distribution of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the signal observed in the invariant mass distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 final states was attributed to a strangeness - changing weak process corresponding to the two- and three - body decays of an unknown bound state of two neutrons associated with a @xmath5 , @xmath8 , via @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is an intriguing conclusion since one would naively expect the @xmath15 system to be unbound . in the @xmath15 system",
    "the two nucleons interact in the @xmath4 partial wave while in the @xmath16 system they interact in the @xmath17 partial wave .",
    "thus , since the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath18 ) interaction in the @xmath4 channel is weaker than the @xmath17 channel , and the @xmath16 system is bound by only 0.13 mev , one may have anticipated that the @xmath15 system should be unbound .",
    "the absence of binding of the @xmath15 system was first demonstrated by dalitz and downs  @xcite using a variational approach , and later from the solution of the faddeev equations with separable interactions @xcite .",
    "the theoretical debate on the possible existence of a neutral bound state of two neutrons and a @xmath5 hyperon , @xmath8 , is still open and has lately deserved an important theoretical effort  @xcite .    in the four - body case",
    ", the analysis of the missing - mass spectrum in the double - charge - exchange reaction @xmath19he(@xmath20he,@xmath20be ) at 186 mev / u has unveiled the possible existence of a tetraneutron resonance @xmath21 mev above the threshold of four - neutron decay with a significance level of 4.9@xmath22  @xcite . in 2002",
    "one collaboration claimed to have found a bound tetraneutron in a @xmath23be breakup reaction  @xcite .",
    "this result remains unconfirmed , and theorists quickly showed that based on the best knowledge of the @xmath18 interaction the existence of a bound tetraneutron was nearly impossible , although they could not rule out the existence of a short - lived resonant state on the basis of a dineutron - dineutron structure  @xcite .",
    "the stability of a tetraneutron state can not be established even with potentials made artificially deeper to produce a dineutron bound state ( the dineutron is a virtual state 66 kev above the two - neutron threshold ) , due to the pauli principle which forbids two identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state . for four - neutrons",
    "only one pair can be in the lowest - energy state , forcing the second pair into a state of higher energy , thereby making the tetraneutron unstable .",
    "thus , one could think of the stability of a modified tetraneutron with bose statistics , where a pair of neutrons is replaced by a pair of neutral light baryons enforcing in this way antisymmetrization with all particles in the lowest - energy state .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath3 = @xmath24 recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and suggested as a possible borromean state .",
    "the relevance of the addition of further baryons on an almost bound two - body system has also been discussed recently by some of us looking for stable bound states of @xmath25 s and @xmath26 s . in ref .  @xcite we pointed out that when a two - baryon interaction is attractive , if the system is merged with nuclear matter and the pauli principle does not impose severe restrictions , the attraction may be reinforced .",
    "simple examples of the effect of a third or a fourth baryon in two - baryon systems could be given .",
    "the deuteron , @xmath27 , is bound by @xmath28 mev , while the triton , @xmath29 , is bound by @xmath30 mev , and the @xmath31 particle , @xmath32 , is bound by @xmath33 mev .",
    "the binding per nucleon @xmath34 increases from @xmath35 .",
    "a similar argument could be employed for strangeness @xmath36 systems . whereas there is no evidence for dibaryon states , the hypertriton @xmath37h , @xmath38 ,",
    "is bound with a separation energy of @xmath39 kev , and the @xmath40h , @xmath32 , is bound with a separation energy of @xmath41 mev  @xcite .",
    "this cooperative effect of the attraction in the two - body subsystems when merged in few - baryon states was also made evident in the prediction of a @xmath42 quasibound state in the @xmath43 channel very near threshold  @xcite .",
    "such @xmath42 quasibound state has been recently suggested in @xmath44 reactions at 600 mev / c  @xcite .",
    "thus , if a second @xmath5 would be added to the uncertain @xmath15 state , the weakly attractive @xmath2 interaction  @xcite and the reinforcement of the @xmath45 potential without paying a price for antisymmetry requirements , may give rise to a stable bound state .",
    "this would be our goal in this paper , to address the study of the @xmath3 state making use of potentials compatible with the low - energy data and phase - shifts of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 systems .",
    "a first examination of this problem has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite based on potentials with a single yukawa attractive term or a morse parametrization .",
    "for the identical pairs , @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the s wave interaction is in the @xmath4 channel due to the pauli principle , while for the @xmath45 pair both @xmath4 and @xmath17 channels contribute . as it is well - known , the @xmath18 @xmath4 channel is almost bound , the virtual state lying slightly below the @xmath0 threshold in the unphysical sheet . in the case of the @xmath18 @xmath4 channel",
    "we use the malfliet - tjon i model  @xcite with the parameters given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for the two - body interactions containing @xmath5 s , @xmath45 and @xmath2 , we use the most recent update on the esc08c nijmegen potentials  @xcite . regarding the two - body interactions containing a single @xmath5 , they are constrained by a simultaneous fit to the combined @xmath18 and @xmath46 scattering data , supplied with constraints on the @xmath46 and @xmath47 interaction originating from the g - matrix information on hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 strangeness @xmath48 interaction is mainly determined by the @xmath18 and @xmath46 data , and su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it gives account of the pivotal results of strangeness @xmath48 physics , the nagara  @xcite and the kiso  @xcite events .",

    "@xcite ) , concludes that the @xmath50 attraction in the esc08c potential is consistent with the @xmath26-nucleus binding energies given by the emulsion data of the twin @xmath5-hypernuclei .",

    "the effect of the repulsive core on the singlet two - body channel is crucial to get this result , while the repulsion on the triplet two - body channel has almost no effect on the binding .",
    "in fact , if the repulsive core in the singlet partial wave is not considered the triton gains around 2 mev of binding ( see table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . based on predictions for separable potentials , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is suggested that the inclusion of the tensor force in the triplet interaction changes the binding energy by 0.3 mev .",
    "indeed , this is the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where as can be seen in table iii a five channel calculation ( s and d partial waves ) differs from a two channel calculation ( only s partial waves ) about 0.3 mev .",
    "the influence of local tensor forces in malfliet - tjon yukawa type interactions has also been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that the inclusion of tensor forces reduces the binding energy of the three - body problem by 1 to 1.5 mev , depending on the d wave percentage .",
    "thus , the local yukawa - type potentials with tensor interaction would lack binding in the three - body problem at difference of separable potentials that would drive to overbinding  @xcite .",
    "note that in the @xmath3 the @xmath18 @xmath17 partial wave does not contribute , thus although this system is free of any uncertainty related to the triplet partial wave , the repulsive core on the singlet @xmath18 channel might play some role .",
    "the four - body problem has been addressed by means of a generalized variational method .",
    "the nonrelativistic hamiltonian will be given by , @xmath58 where the potentials @xmath59 have been discussed in the previous section .",

    "for the description of the four - body wave function we consider the jacobi coordinates : @xmath67 the total wave function should have well - defined permutation properties under the exchange of identical particles .",
    "the most general s wave radial wave function may depend on the six scalar quantities that can be constructed with the jacobi coordinates of the system , they are : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we define the variational spatial wave function as a linear combination of _ generalized gaussians _ , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of gaussians used for each spin - isospin component .",
    "@xmath76 depends on six variational parameters : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , one for each scalar quantity .",

    "as can be seen the agreement is good .",
    "once we have described the phase shifts , the @xmath45 and @xmath2 potentials include in an effective manner the coupling to other two - body channels as it may be the @xmath99 or @xmath100 two - body systems .",
    "we have also tested the two - body interactions in the three - body problem of systems made of @xmath25 s and @xmath5 s .",
    "the hypertriton is bound by 144 kev , and the @xmath15 system is unbound .",
    "the reasonable description on the two- and three - body problem gives confidence to address the study of the @xmath101 state .",
    "using the variational method described in the last section , we have evaluated the binding energy of the @xmath101 system with quantum numbers @xmath57 .",
    "the system is unbound appearing just above threshold and thus it does not seem to be borromean , a four - body bound state without two- or three - body stable subsystems . an unbound result was also reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , although in this case the authors made use of repulsive gaussian - type potentials for any of the two - body subsystems ( see the figure on pag .",
    "475 ) what does not allow for the existence of any bound state .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the binding on the strength of the attractive part of the different two - body interactions entering the four - body problem . for this purpose",
    "we have used the following interactions , @xmath102 with the same parameters given in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the system hardly gets bound for a reasonable increase of the strength of the attractive part of the @xmath2 interaction , @xmath103 . although one can not exclude that the genuine @xmath2 interaction in dilute states as the one studied here could be slightly stronger that the one reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , one needs @xmath104 to get a bound state , what would destroy the agreement with the esc08c nijmegen @xmath2 phase shifts .",
    "note also that this is also a very sensitive parameter for the study of double-@xmath5 hypernuclei  @xcite . taking a factor @xmath105 in the attractive part of the @xmath4 @xmath18 interaction , that would make the @xmath4 @xmath18 potential as strong as the @xmath17  @xcite and thus the singlet s wave would develop a dineutron bound state , the four - body system would start to be bound .",
    "the situation is slightly different when dealing with the @xmath45 interaction .",
    "we have used a common factor @xmath106 for attractive part of the two @xmath45 partial waves , @xmath4 and @xmath17 .",

    "the method used to solve the four - body problem is similar to the one we have used in our calculation , thus the results might be directly comparable . our improved description of the two- and three - body subsystems and the introduction of the repulsive barrier for the @xmath4 @xmath18 partial wave , relevant for the study of the triton binding energy ( see table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , leads to a four - body state just above threshold , that can not get bound by a reliable modification in the two - body subsystems .",
    "as clearly explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the window of borromean binding is more an more reduced for potentials with harder inner cores .    as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , many effects are still to be taken into account after arriving to any definitive conclusion . among the refinements that would eliminate uncertainties",
    ", it would be a future challenge to consider three - body forces that may have an attractive component as suggested when studying the triton and @xmath19he  @xcite .",
    "although by fitting the @xmath45 phase shifts , the coupling to the @xmath99 system has been included in an effective manner , it would also be interesting to unfold the effective @xmath55 interaction , separating the contribution from @xmath109 . as it has been discussed in the literature  @xcite the hypertriton",
    "does not get bound by considering only @xmath110 channels , but it is necessary to include also @xmath111 channels .",
    "similar considerations hold from the @xmath112 coupling , that is expected to play a minor role in this case , because the nucleon generated in the transition must occupy an excited @xmath113shell , the lowest @xmath114shell being forbidden by the pauli principle  @xcite .",
    "in brief , based on a reasonable approach to the interactions of two - body subsystems contributing to the @xmath57 @xmath101 state , it does not present a bound state .",
    "we have fitted not only the low - energy parameters of the two - body subsystems , but also the phase - shifts .",
    "we have considered the repulsive barrier in the two - body interactions , that it is relevant for a correct description of the triton binding energy .",
    "we have also studied the strange three - body subsystems involved in the problem , the hypertriton bound by 144 kev , and the @xmath15 system that it is unbound .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 four - body system does not seem to be borromean . finally , although our arguments on the unbound nature of the @xmath3 are strong , one should bear in mind how delicate is the few - body problem in the regime of weak binding , as demonstrated in ref .  @xcite .",
