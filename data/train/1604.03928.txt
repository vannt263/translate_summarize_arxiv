    "there have been many studies of dynamical predator - prey systems that simulate biological processes .",
    "particularly interesting early work was done by bell @xcite , who showed that the immune response can be modeled quite effectively by such systems . in bell",
    "s work the time evolution of competing concentrations of one antigen and one antibody is studied .",
    "the current paper shows what happens if we combine two antibody - antigen subsystems _ in a @xmath0-symmetric fashion _ to make an immune system in which there are _ two _ antibodies and _ two antigens_. an unexpected conclusion is that even if one antigen is lethal ( because the antigen concentration grows out of bounds ) , the introduction of a _ second _ antigen can stabilize the concentrations of _ both _ antigens , and thus save the life of the host .",
    "introducing a second antigen may actually drive the concentration of the lethal antigen to zero .",
    "we say that a classical dynamical system is @xmath0 _ symmetric _ if the equations describing the system remain invariant under combined space reflection @xmath1 and time reversal @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "classical @xmath0-symmetric systems have a typical generic structure ; they consist of two coupled identical subsystems , one having gain and the other having loss .",
    "such systems are @xmath0 symmetric because under space reflection the systems with loss and with gain are interchanged while under time reversal loss and gain are again interchanged .",
    "systems having @xmath0 symmetry typically exhibit two different characteristic behaviors .",
    "if the two subsystems are coupled sufficiently strongly , then the gain in one subsystem can be balanced by the loss in the other and thus the total system can be in equilibrium . in this case",
    "the system is said to be in an _ unbroken _ @xmath0-symmetric phase .",
    "( one visible indication that a linear system is in an unbroken phase is that it exhibits rabi oscillations in which energy oscillates between the two subsystems . )",
    "however , if the subsystems are weakly coupled , the amplitude in the subsystem with gain grows while the amplitude in the subsystem with loss decays .",
    "such a system is not in equilibrium and is said to be in a _ broken _ @xmath0-symmetric phase .",
    "interestingly , if the subsystems are very strongly coupled , it may also be in a broken @xmath0-symmetric phase because one subsystem tends to drag the other subsystem .    a simple linear @xmath0-symmetric system that exhibits a @xmath0 phase transition from weak to moderate coupling and a second transition from moderate to strong coupling consists of a pair of coupled oscillators , one with damping and the other with antidamping .",
    "such a system is described by the pair of linear differential equations @xmath3 this system is invariant under combined parity reflection @xmath1 , which interchanges @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and time reversal @xmath2 , which replaces @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",

    "it is equally easy to find physical nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric physical systems .",
    "for example , consider a solution containing the oxidizing reagent potassium permanganate @xmath8 and a reducing agent such as oxalic acid @xmath9 .",
    "the reaction of these reagents is self - catalyzing because the presence of manganous @xmath10 ions increases the speed of the reaction .",
    "the chemical reaction in the presence of oxalic acid is @xmath11 thus , if @xmath12 is the concentration of permanganate ions and @xmath13 is the concentration of manganous ions , then the rate equation is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the rate constant .",
    "this system is @xmath0 invariant , where @xmath1 exchanges @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath2 replaces @xmath6 with @xmath7 . for this system , the @xmath0 symmetry is always broken ; the system is not in equilibrium .",
    "the volterra ( predator - prey ) equations are a slightly more complicated @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear system : @xmath16 this system is oscillatory and thus we say that the @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken .",
    "these equations are discussed in ref .",

    "the usual procedure is to make the _ ansatz _ @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this reduces the system of differential equations to a polynomial equation for the frequency @xmath19 .",
    "we then associate unbroken ( or broken ) phases with real ( or complex ) frequencies @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath19 is real , the solutions to both equations are oscillatory and remain bounded , and this indicates that the physical system is in dynamic equilibrium .",
    "however , if @xmath19 is complex , the solutions grow or decay exponentially with @xmath6 , which indicates that the system is not in equilibrium .    for more complicated nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric dynamical systems ,",
    "we still say that the system is in a phase of broken @xmath0 symmetry if the solutions grow or decay with time or approach a limit as @xmath20 because the system is not in dynamic equilibrium .",
    "in contrast , if the variables oscillate and remain bounded as @xmath6 increases we say that the system is in a phase of unbroken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "however , in this case the time dependence of the variables is unlikely to be periodic ; such systems usually exhibit _ almost periodic _ or _",

    "we construct and examine in detail a @xmath0-symmetric dynamical model of an antigen - antibody system containing _ two _ antigens and _ two _ antibodies .",
    "this system is similar in structure to that in ( [ e6 ] ) .",
    "we show that in the unbroken region the concentrations of antigens and antibodies generally become chaotic and we interpret this as a chronic infection .",

    "the foreign material provoking the response is called an _ antigen _ and the immune response",
    "is characterized by the production of _ antibodies _ , which are molecules that bind specifically to the antigen and cause its destruction .",
    "the time - dependent immune response to a replicating antigen may be treated as a dynamical system with interacting populations of the antigen , the antibodies , and the cells that are involved in the production of antibodies .",
    "a detailed description of such an immune response would be extremely complicated so in this paper we consider a simplified mathematical model of the immune response proposed by bell @xcite .",
    "bell s paper introduces a simple model in which the multiplication of antigen and antibodies is assumed to be governed by lokta - volterra - type equations , where the antigen plays the role of prey and the antibody plays the role of predator .",
    "while such a model may be an unrealistic simulation of an actual immune response , bell argues that this mathematical approach gives a useful qualitative and quantitative description .",
    "following bell s paper we take the variable @xmath33 to represent the concentration of antibody and the variable @xmath34 to represent the concentration of antigen at time @xmath6 . assuming that the system has an unlimited capability of antibody production , bell s dynamical model describes the time dependence of antigen and antibody concentrations by the differential equations @xmath60 according to ( [ e7 ] ) , the antigen concentration @xmath61 increases at a constant rate @xmath62 if the antibody @xmath50 is are not present .",
    "as soon as antigens are bound to antibodies , the antibodies start being eliminated at the constant rate @xmath63 .",
    "analogously , the concentration of antibody @xmath50 decays with constant rate @xmath64 in the absence of antigens , while binding of antigens to antibodies stimulates the production of antibody @xmath50 with constant rate @xmath65 .",

    "if @xmath75 and @xmath77 , there is an inspiral ( the antigen approaches a limiting value in an oscillatory fashion ) . *",
    "if @xmath75 and @xmath78 , the system exhibits exactly periodic oscillations .",
    "this behavior is unusual in a nonlinear system and indeed ( [ e6 ] ) does not exhibit exact periodic behavior .",
    "subsequent to bell s paper @xcite there have been many studies that use two - dimensional dynamical models to examine the antigen - antibody interaction @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we construct a _",
    "four_-dimensional model consisting of two antigens and two antibodies .",
    "let us assume that an antigen @xmath61 attacks an organism and that the immune response consists of creating antibodies @xmath50 as described by ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "however , we suppose that the organism has a second system of antibodies and antigens @xmath24 .",
    "this second subsystem plays the role of a @xmath0-symmetric partner of the system @xmath79 , where parity @xmath1 interchanges the antibody @xmath50 with the antigen @xmath80 and the antigen @xmath61 with the antibody @xmath50 , @xmath81 and time reversal @xmath2 makes the replacement @xmath82 .",

    "we assume that because antibodies may have many possible binding sites , @xmath50 can also bind to antigen @xmath80 and that antibody @xmath51 can also bind to antigen @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , for this model we assume that we can scale the dynamical variables so that this interaction is the same as the interaction @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "<S> the study of @xmath0-symmetric physical systems began in 1998 as a complex generalization of conventional quantum mechanics , but beginning in 2007 experiments began to be published in which the predicted @xmath0 phase transition was clearly observed in classical rather than in quantum - mechanical systems . </S>",
    "<S> this paper examines the @xmath0 phase transition in mathematical models of antigen - antibody systems . </S>",
    "<S> a surprising conclusion that can be drawn from these models is that a possible way to treat a serious disease in which the antigen concentration is growing out of bounds ( and the host will die ) is to inject a small dose of a _ second _ ( different ) antigen . in this case </S>",
    "<S> there are two possible favorable outcomes . in the unbroken-@xmath0-symmetric phase the disease becomes chronic and is no longer lethal while in the appropriate broken-@xmath0-symmetric phase the concentration of lethal antigen goes to zero and </S>",
