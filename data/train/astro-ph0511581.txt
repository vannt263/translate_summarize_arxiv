    "the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies ( hereafter , e / s0s ) has been a major subject of research during the past decades .",
    "both theoretical and empirical studies indicate that the stellar mass density of the etg population has increased by at least a factor of two between @xmath1 and the present day @xcite at the same time , studies at @xmath2 show that massive e / s0s were already several @xmath11 old at that epoch @xcite .",
    "it is an intriguing puzzle to explain these seemingly contradictory results in one picture describing early - type galaxy formation .",
    "these results hinge on determining galaxy masses , which remains very hard to do at high redshift .",
    "typically , mass estimates for high-@xmath12 galaxies are obtained by comparing their photometric properties with stellar population models in order to infer a mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath13 ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such sed - fitting methods are intrinsically uncertain , and dynamical mass calibrations are needed to overcome the large uncertainty in the low mass end of the initial mass function ( imf ) , dark matter content , and , most importantly , to verify the validity of stellar population models .",
    "a more quantitative approach is to use the fundamental plane ( fp , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to directly measure the evolution of @xmath13 at rest - frame optical wavelengths out to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "although the measurement of the evolution of @xmath13 itself is model independent , the inferred age and formation redshift are sensitive to the choice of the parameters ( e.g. , imf and metallicity ) of the stellar population model , and even the choice of the model . by measuring the evolution of @xmath13 at other wavelengths than the rest - frame @xmath5-band , the formation redshift can be established independently , and the range of possible model parameters constrained . furthermore",
    ", the validity of different models can be verified .",
    "more specifically , different models predict a different evolution of the @xmath13 in the near infra - red ( nir ) relative to the evolution of the optical @xmath13 .",
    "an advantage of measuring the evolution of the nir @xmath13 is that the nir luminosity is less affected by the presence of a low mass young stellar population . since measuring the evolution of @xmath13 provides a luminosity - weighted age estimate",
    ", the evolution of the nir @xmath13 provides a less biased age estimate . with the arrival of the near infra - red array camera ( irac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the spitzer space telescope , studying the rest - frame nir properties of the high-@xmath12 e / s0 population has become feasible . in this _",
    "letter _ we combine irac imaging with our high-@xmath12 fp study @xcite , such that the evolution of @xmath13 in the rest - frame @xmath0-band is measured for the first time . a calibration of galaxy masses derived from nir luminosities is thus provided .",
    "@xcite provide a spectroscopic sample of 29 distant galaxies in the cdfs with accurate velocity dispersions .",
    "spitzer gto data are available , providing irac imaging in four channels ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ) of a field containing the chandra deep field - south ( cdfs ) . using the irac data we derive the rest - frame nir photometry of those 20 galaxies in the spectroscopic sample with early - type morphologies and sufficiently high @xmath19 spectra ( @xmath20 per  ) .",
    "the average redshift of this sample is @xmath21 and the average mass is @xmath22 .",
    "12 galaxies in this sample are regarded as the primary sample : these objects are all at @xmath23 and satisfy all selection criteria applied by @xcite .",
    "the other objects , mostly galaxies at @xmath24 , are referred to as the secondary sample. the irac data are sufficiently deep ( 500s ) to obtain high @xmath19 photometry of all galaxies in the sample , certainly in the two shortest wavelength channels .",
    "the irac fluxes were measured by matching the point spread functions of all available optical / nir / irac images to the @xmath18 irac image ( which has the lowest spatial resolution , @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xmath26 diameter aperture fluxes were measured using sextractor @xcite to derive colors .",
    "color gradients are ignored , but because the sizes of the @xmath2 galaxies are much smaller ( @xmath27 ) than the size of the irac psf this will only have a very small effect .",
    "the median formal errors in the irac fluxes of the galaxies in the sample are 0.01 , 0.01 , 0.10 and 0.13 mag for the four channels , respectively . additionally , the systematic uncertainty in the irac zero - points is 0.03 mag .",
    "we transformed the observed colors to rest - frame @xmath28 colors using a procedure similar to what is described by @xcite .",
    "the typical error in the rest - frame @xmath28 color is 0.06 mag , excluding the systematic error of 0.03 mag .",
    "total luminosities were derived from the structural parameters as obtained from the acs @xmath12-band images and the colors are described above .    from the higher resolution @xmath0-band",
    "image we checked whether the irac photometry of our sample suffers from confusion .",
    "three of the objects in our sample have close neighbors with such magnitudes that our photometry might be erroneous .",
    "however , we do not see a difference between these contaminated objects and the rest of the sample in either color , @xmath13 , or any other parameter . in figure 1",
    "we show the seds of three high - redshift e / s0s . as an illustration we overplot a @xcite model spectrum for a @xmath29-old stellar population , demonstrating that the observed seds have reasonable shapes .",
    "we also measured the colors of a sample of 41 e / s0s in the cdfs at @xmath30 .",
    "these were morphologically selected by eye from the acs imaging .",
    "the redshifts are taken from combo-17 @xcite .",
    "we use the average @xmath28 color of this sample to complement the @xmath28 evolution of the galaxies in the fp sample .",
    "if galaxies evolve passively , the offset of high-@xmath12 galaxies from the local fp is a measure of the difference between the @xmath13 of the distant galaxy and the @xmath13 and their local counterparts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the rate of evolution is a measure of the relative age difference between the local and distant galaxies .    to obtain the @xmath13 evolution in the @xmath0-band",
    ", we compare the nir properties of the distant galaxies with the local fp in the @xmath0-band @xcite , i.e. , we need effective radii ( @xmath31 ) and surface brightnesses ( @xmath32 ) of the distant galaxies in the rest - frame @xmath0-band . however , the spatial resolution of irac is too low to measure galaxy sizes at @xmath2 .",
    "instead we assume that @xmath33 and determine the surface brightness at this radius .",
    "although this causes some error in the fp , previous work has shown that the combination of @xmath31 and @xmath32 which enters the fp is very stable against such errors @xcite .",
    "the nir surface brightness within the optical effective radius is provided by @xcite for a local sample of cluster galaxies . for the distant sample",
    "we compute @xmath34 from @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath36 is the color inside the effective radius .",
    "it is calculated from the total @xmath28 color by correcting for the negative color gradient measured by @xcite .",
    "the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath36 is -0.07 mag .",
    "the local @xmath0-band fp is based on cluster galaxies , but our sample consists of field galaxies .",
    "@xcite have shown that field galaxies have @xmath37 lower @xmath10 than cluster galaxies . assuming that this difference is caused by either a difference in age or metallicity",
    ", this translates into a 2% difference in @xmath3 , which follows from stellar population models from @xcite .",
    "we take this difference into account when comparing the fp at high and low redshifts .",
    "we show the evolution of @xmath3 with redshift in figure 2 .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath3 evolves significantly from @xmath2 to the present .",
    "the evolution of the sample is @xmath38 , obtained from a least squares linear fit .",
    "the primary sample alone evolves at a similar rate : @xmath39 . comparing these numbers to the evolution of @xmath10 ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively )",
    ", we see that the evolution in @xmath3 is somewhat slower than the evolution in @xmath10 . the scatter in @xmath42",
    "is @xmath43 , which is not much smaller than the scatter in the @xmath5-band ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "this is much larger than can be accounted for by measurement errors , and is most likely caused by an age spread of the stellar populations of the galaxies , as has been demonstrated before @xcite . in the @xmath5-band",
    "the measured evolution is strongly mass - dependent @xcite , mostly due to selection effects , but partially due to intrinsic differences between high- and low - mass galaxies @xcite . in the @xmath0-band",
    "the difference is much less pronounced , and only marginally significant .",
    "the galaxies in the primary sample with masses higher than @xmath45 evolve as @xmath46 ; galaxies less massive than that as @xmath47 . in the @xmath5-band",
    "these numbers are , respectively , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the model prediction that @xmath3 is less sensitive than @xmath10 to the age of a stellar population and recent star formation .    concluding , we find that the evolution of @xmath3 from @xmath1 to the present is @xmath50 slower than the evolution of @xmath10 .",
    "we note that this direct measurement deviates from previous determinations of the evolution of @xmath3 that were based on extrapolating observed seds ( including the @xmath0-band as the longest wavelength data ) to the rest - frame @xmath0-band at @xmath2 using stellar population models .",
    "such studies found that @xmath3 evolves at least twice as slow as @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this demonstrates that extrapolating observed @xmath0-band photometry of high-@xmath12 galaxies to rest - frame @xmath0-band @xmath13 is hazardous and strongly model dependent .",
    "our results allow us to compare the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath3 directly with predictions from stellar population models .",
    "we compare our results with the predictions of three models : @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( hereafter , bc03 , v96 , and m04 , respectively ) .",
    "a critical aspect of the models is the method that is used to implement late stellar evolutionary phases . bc03 and",
    "v96 compute isochrones up to the early agb phase , and include an empirical prescription for the thermally pulsating- ( tp- ) agb phase . on the contrary ,",
    "m04 adopt the fuel consumption approach , which allows implementation of short - duration but very luminous evolutionary stages , such as the tp - agb phases , in an analytical and numerically stable way .    in figure 3",
    "we compare the evolution from @xmath1 to the present of @xmath10 and @xmath3 , and the related change in the rest - frame @xmath28 color . the bc03 model with solar metallicity and a salpeter imf",
    "does not fit the data : the predicted evolution of @xmath3 against @xmath10 is significantly slower than observed . before investigating different models and model parameters ,",
    "we consider several possible explanations for an apparently fast evolution of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath10 that are unrelated to stellar populations .",
    "first , a difference in dust content between local e / s0s and @xmath2 e / s0s could lead to redder colors at @xmath1 than expected from dust - free models .",
    "however , the amount of reddening required to match the bc03 model with solar metallicity and a salpeter imf is considerably large for half of the galaxies in our sample ( @xmath51 ) , and several even require @xmath52 .",
    "although the optical spectra show no indication of such high opacities , observations at longer wavelengths with spitzer can constrain the presence of dust - enshrouded populations which might contribute in the k - band .",
    "one might expect to observe irregular morphologies or irregular intensity profiles if the absorption were so high .",
    "we note that the galaxies do not show such effects at the acs resolution .",
    "second , the red colors might be produced by agn in the @xmath2 sample that are obscured in the optical , but not entirely in the nir .",
    "next , we test whether changing parameters within the single - burst bc03 model can improve the consistency between the model and the data .",
    "increasing the metallicity does not change the predictions by much .",
    "changing the star formation history ( sfh ) does not lead to better fits to the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath3 , unless models with constant star formation rates or exponentially declining star formation rates with e - folding time scales of several @xmath11 are adopted .",
    "these models , however , have very blue colors that do not match the @xmath28 colors of the galaxies in our sample , nor the colors of the local population .",
    "flattening the slope of the imf ( from 1.35 to 0.35 ) does shift the model curve toward our data points , leading to an acceptable fit .",
    "finally , we compare our results to other models .",
    "as can be seen in figure 3 , the v96 and m04 models with a salpeter imf and solar metallicity provide better fits than bc03 .",
    "note that the differences between the models with identical parameters are very large ; e.g. , bc03 predict a correlation between color and @xmath53 , whereas m04 does not .",
    "we note that the spread of the data points representing the individual galaxies is large , but that there is no clear correlation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 . even assuming a flat imf ,",
    "the bc03 model can not reproduce the data points at the bottom right part of figure 3b .",
    "the m04 model does fit to those data points . on the other hand , data points at the upper left of figure 3b",
    "are not fit well by the m04 model .",
    "however , all but one of the these data points can be fit with a model with an exponentially declining star formation rate with @xmath56 .",
    "we can use the simple single burst models to estimate the average , luminosity - weighted formation redshift of the stellar populations of the galaxies .",
    "the formation redshift as estimated from the evolution of @xmath10 is @xmath57 and @xmath58 , using the models from bc03 and m04 , respectively , with a salpeter imf and solar metallicity . according to the same models",
    ", the evolution of @xmath3 suggests that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the bc03 model with a flat imf provides a better fit to our results than the bc03 model with a salpeter imf and produces @xmath61 , both from the evolution in the @xmath10 and the evolution in @xmath3 .",
    "as can be seen , the constraints on @xmath62 are not improved by measuring the evolution of @xmath3 .",
    "this is entirely due to the rather large model uncertainty in the rest - frame @xmath0-band evolution .",
    "obviously , it is of the greatest relevance to improve our knowledge of both the agb phase and the dust content of high redshift elliptical galaxies , as dust may mimic some of the results we see .",
    "finally , we note that e / s0s are thought to be relatively simple systems , with simple sfhs .",
    "it is likely that the model uncertainties are even higher for galaxies with a more complex sfh .",
    "irrespective of the causes of the discrepancies between the models and the observations , the results presented here suggest that the rest - frame @xmath0-band photometry of such galaxies may be difficult to interpret .",
    "further studies of the role of dust and agn would be valuable .",
    "if they do play a role in the photometric bands analyzed here , proper modeling of the colors is more complex than thought before . in the next paper",
    ", we will explore full sed fitting , the uncertainties in determining stellar masses , and distinguish between the applicability of different stellar population models .",
