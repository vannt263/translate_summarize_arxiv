    "in the functional one may neglect the interactions that are fixed as `` boundary datum '' since they can not contribute to the minimisation ( and they also may give an infinite contribution , which is safer to take away ) .",
    "that is , the set  @xmath4 splits @xmath3 and its complement into four sets , two inside  @xmath3 , namely  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 , and two outside  @xmath3 , namely  @xmath7 and  @xmath8 , see figure  2 .",
    "then the functional is the collection of the interactions of the points in  @xmath9 and  @xmath10 with the points in  @xmath11 and  @xmath12 , with the exception of the interactions of points in  @xmath10 with the ones in  @xmath12 , that are `` fixed by the boundary values '' .",

    "the interaction  @xmath17 that was considered in  @xcite is @xmath18 for any disjoint , measurable sets  @xmath19 , @xmath20 and for a fixed  @xmath21 .",
    "the restriction on the range of  @xmath22 is natural , since the integrals in   diverge in general when  @xmath23\\cup[1/2,+\\infty)$ ] ( more precisely , for  @xmath24 the contributions at infinity become unbounded , while for  @xmath25 the problem arises from point  @xmath26 and  @xmath27 arbitrarily close to each other ) .",
    "the functional in   naturally produces a minimisation problem : that is , one says that  @xmath3 is @xmath22-minimal in  @xmath2 if  @xmath28 for any measurable set  @xmath29 that coincides with  @xmath3 outside  @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) .",
    "the necessary compactness and semicontinuity properties to ensure the existence of such @xmath22-minimisers are proved in section  3 of  @xcite , and the following result was obtained :    [ 99 ] let  @xmath31 be a bounded lipschitz domain and @xmath32 be a given set .",
    "there exists a set  @xmath3 , with  @xmath33 such that @xmath34 for any  @xmath29 such that  @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite @xmath22-minimisers are proved to satisfy a suitable integral equation , that is the euler - lagrange equation corresponding to the functional in  .",
    "namely suppose that  @xmath3 is @xmath22-minimal in  @xmath2 and that  @xmath36 : then , namely @xmath37 ] @xmath38 from the geometric point of view ,   states that a suitable average of  @xmath3 ( centred at any point of  @xmath39 ) is balanced by the average of its complement .",
    "due to the singularity of the denominator , only makes sense for smooth sets : at this level , without knowing any a priori regularity for the set",

    "one may somehow turn around this difficulty by reducing the minimisation problem in   to a pde problem in  @xmath41 . for this , given  @xmath42 , one introduces the extension of  @xmath43 as @xmath44 here we used the notation  @xmath45 , and  @xmath46 is a normalising constant . given  @xmath47 and  @xmath48 , we define @xmath49 then we have the following result :    [ 73 ] the set @xmath3 is an @xmath22-minimiser in a ball  @xmath20 if and only if the extension  @xmath50 of @xmath51 satisfies @xmath52 for all bounded lipschitz domains @xmath47 with  @xmath53 and all functions  @xmath54 that equal  @xmath50 in a neighbourhood of  @xmath55 and take the values  @xmath56 on  @xmath57 .    notice that the restriction for  @xmath54 to take values  @xmath56 `` on the trace ''  @xmath58 ( that is , to `` agree with a set '' on  @xmath59 ) causes several analytical difficulties in the choice of the admissible perturbations of  @xmath50 .",
    "one of the main questions addressed in  @xcite is the one of the regularity of the @xmath22-minimisers : that is , it is shown there that  @xmath22-minimisers are smooth sets outside a singular set of  @xmath60-hausdorff dimension :    [ s989 ] if @xmath3 is an @xmath22-minimiser in  @xmath61 , then @xmath62 is , to the possible exception of a closed set  @xmath63 of finite  @xmath60-hausdorff dimension , a @xmath64-hypersurface around each of its points .",
    "notice that one expects  @xmath39 to be `` an @xmath65-dimensional object '' , so the statement that  @xmath63 is `` an @xmath60-dimensional object '' states that  @xmath63 is somehow negligible inside  @xmath39 , hence  @xmath39 is smooth near `` the majority of its points '' .",
    "on the other hand , theorem  [ s989 ] leaves many questions open : for instance , is there any singular set at all ?",
    "are there any singularities if the dimension  @xmath66 is small enough ?",
    "what do the @xmath22-minimisers look like ?",
    "some of these questions will be discussed in further detail in   [ 8855]-[88811 ] .",
    "as for the latter problem , it is quite embarrassing to admit that , at the moment , there is a real lack of explicit examples : indeed , the only explicit @xmath22-minimiser known is the half - plane ( which is in fact a minimiser in any domain  @xmath2 ) : this was proved in corollary  5.3 in  @xcite and the proof is based on a comparison principle ( i.e. , if an  @xmath22-minimiser is contained in some strip outside  @xmath2 , then it is contained in the same strip inside  @xmath2 too ) . notice that this lack of explicit examples does not prevent @xmath22-minimisers from existing ( recall theorem  [ 99 ] ) . in any case , at the moment , no @xmath22-minimiser with a non - void singular set is known .",

    "_    one may also wonder if there are sets satisfying the euler - lagrange equation in   that possess a non - void singular set : the answer is in the affirmative , and a simple example is given by the classical cone in the plane @xmath68 see figure  3 .",
    "of course , @xmath69 has a singularity at the origin , and , by symmetry , one sees that @xmath70      up to now , the reason for which we think that the functional in   is a `` fractional perimeter '' may seem mysterious to a reader not familiar with the subject .",
    "the motivation arises for the asymptotics as  @xmath71 in which the functional  @xmath72 ( suitably renormalised ) approaches the classical perimeter ( as usual , we use the notation  @xmath73 for the surface of the @xmath65-dimensional sphere ) :    [ 888990 ] @xmath74    * let  @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and  @xmath3 be a set with  @xmath64-boundary in  @xmath78 .",

    "also , @xmath81 approach  @xmath3 uniformly in  @xmath86 , meaning that for any  @xmath89 there exists  @xmath90 ( possibly depending on  @xmath91 and  @xmath92 ) such that if  @xmath93 then  @xmath94 and  @xmath95 are contained , respectively , in an @xmath92-neighbourhood of  @xmath3 and of  @xmath96 .",
    "also , one can show that the convergence of the functional in   to the classical perimeter as  @xmath71 holds in a suitable  @xmath97-convergence sense : see  @xcite . in any case",

    "in particular , we may take  @xmath112 in   for a smooth  @xmath113 ( the smoothness of  @xmath3 ensures that  @xmath114_{g , s_o}$ ] is finite and the boundedness of  @xmath3 that  @xmath115 ) : we conclude that @xmath116_{g , s}^2 \\\\&\\qquad = c_n \\| \\chi_e\\|_{l^2({\\mathds{r}}^n)}^2=c_n { { \\mathscr}{l}}^n(e).\\end{split}\\ ] ] the asymptotic behaviour as  @xmath98 in the general case is slightly more complicated and it is dealt with in  @xcite : the main difficulties are that the limit may not even exist and , when it does exist , it is a suitable convex combination of the normalised lebesgue measure of  @xmath117 with the one of  @xmath118 , with the convex interpolation parameter depending on the `` shape of  @xmath3 outside  @xmath2 '' .",
    "more precisely , one introduces the parameter @xmath119 and the normalised lebesgue measure  @xmath120 . notice that @xmath121 hence  @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "then , in some sense ( that we will make precise below in theorem  [ ts 0 ] ) , the asymptotic behaviour as  @xmath98 is given by the formula @xmath123 notice that when  @xmath3 is a smooth subset of  @xmath2 , then  @xmath124 for some  @xmath76 , hence @xmath125 i.e.  @xmath126 and so   boils down to  .",
    "moreover , states that the @xmath22-perimeter ( suitably normalised , which has a non - local nature ) approaches as  @xmath98 the convex combinations of two measures `` localised '' in  @xmath2 ( namely  @xmath127 and  @xmath128 ) , but the combination parameter  @xmath129 takes into account the contribution of  @xmath3 `` coming from infinity '' . though this is rather attractive , a rigorous statement has to take into account the possibilities that the above limits do not exist , and the precise result on the asymptotics as  @xmath98 reads as follows :    [ ts 0 ] let  @xmath3 be such that  @xmath130 for some  @xmath131 and suppose that the limit defining  @xmath129 in   exists . then the limit in   holds true .    also ,",

    "the existence condition on the limit defining  @xmath129 in   can not be removed from theorem  [ ts 0 ] , since @xcite also provides an example when such limit does not exist ( and the limit in   does not exist as well ) .",

    "an example for which the limit as  @xmath98 of the fractional perimeter does not exist . _",
    "very roughly speaking , the example ( as grossly depicted in figure  4 ) considers a set  @xmath3 which `` looks like a cone '' of a small opening in the annulus  @xmath133 , then like a cone of a big opening in the annulus  @xmath134 , and so on , alternating cones of small and big openings in subsequent annuli , with  @xmath135 to be chosen appropriately .",
    "then , the idea is that  @xmath129 would `` feel alternatively '' the small and the big cone openings in the asymptotics and consequently the limit in   does not exist ( of course , some computation is needed to relate the `` spatial oscillation '' in the annuli with the parameter  @xmath98 , see example  2.7 in  @xcite for details ) . anyway , from theorems  [ 888990 ] and  [ ts 0 ] , with a slight abuse of notation , one may think that the fractional perimeter interpolates the classical perimeter with a weighted lebesgue measure when the parameter @xmath22 varies in the range  @xmath136 .",
    "now we go back to the regularity issue of the @xmath22-minimal sets .",

    "one also improves theorem  [ s989 ] , obtaining that the singular set @xmath63 in  @xmath59 has finite  @xmath158-hausdorff dimension ( instead of  @xmath159 : and we do not know whether or not this is optimal , see theorem  [ n ] below ) .",
    "the last claim in theorem  [ 2 ] somehow states that fractional geodesics in the plane are straight lines , as happens in the classical case .",

    "the finite  @xmath237-hausdorff dimension statement in theorem  [ n ] improves ( when  @xmath22 in the `` right range '' ) the previous ones mentioned in theorem  [ s989 ] and right below theorem  [ 2 ] .",
    "unfortunately the proof of theorem  [ n ] uses a compactness argument , therefore nothing is known on  @xmath238 ( except that it is a positive , universal quantity , depending only on  @xmath66 , but no explicit bound is available ) . of course , from theorem  [ 2 ] we know that  @xmath239 is fine for the regularity theory when  @xmath137 ( but this really comes from  @xcite and it can not be proved with the argument in  @xcite ) .",
    "of course , any explicit bound on  @xmath238 would be welcome to make theorem  [ n ] applicable in concrete cases .",
    "notice also that , in view of theorem  [ ts 0 ] , we know that for  @xmath22 close to  @xmath240 the @xmath22-minimal sets seem related to the minimisers of the lebesgue measure , for which no regularity result is possible ( a set can have a small lebesgue measure and possess a very wild boundary ) . therefore , the regularity of @xmath22-minimal sets when @xmath22 is close to  @xmath240 ( if it holds true ) is conceivably more difficult than in the case in which @xmath22 is close to  @xmath228 .",
    "classical minimal surfaces naturally arise in phase transition models .",
    "similarly @xmath22-minimisers of the functional in   arise in non - local phase transition models , in which the classical diffusion term is replaced by the fractional laplacian . to see this ,",

    "these heuristic considerations can be made rigorous by introducing a parameter  @xmath92 and by considering the rescaled minimiser @xmath246 scaling  @xmath43 to @xmath247 in   ( and normalising by a multiplicative factor of order  @xmath248 which does not change the notion of minimisers ) , one is lead to study the functional @xmath249 then , the following classical result holds true :      * as  @xmath250 , @xmath251 @xmath97-converges to the classical perimeter functional , i.e. , for any set  @xmath3 of locally finite perimeter , the following holds : * * for any @xmath252)$ ] converging to  @xmath51 in  @xmath253 , we have that @xmath254 * * there exists  @xmath252)$ ] that converges to  @xmath51 in  @xmath253 such that @xmath255 * the following compactness properties holds : if @xmath252)$ ] and @xmath256 then there exists  @xmath3 and a convergent subsequence such that  @xmath247 converges to  @xmath51 in  @xmath253 . *",

    "the aim of the following pages is to present what happens to these results in the fractional framework and to discuss some possible consequences . for this , we first introduce a domain notation by setting @xmath265 the set  @xmath266 will represent the natural domain of a non - local interaction between particles in  @xmath59 : namely this interaction is represented by an integral over  @xmath267 , but we will remove from this integral the contribution given by two particles both lying in the complement of  @xmath2 , since this will be considered fixed by the datum ( this is the same type of renormalisation procedure performed in  ) . more concretely , for any  @xmath268 we consider the functional @xmath269 notice that the functional  @xmath270 differs from the functional  @xmath271 in   since the gradient part ( i.e. , the @xmath272-seminorm of  @xmath43 in  @xmath2 ) is replaced here by a double integral of gagliardo type , which tries to mimic a long - range particle interaction energy . the euler - lagrange equation associated with  @xmath270",
    "is @xmath273 which may be seen as a fractional variant of the classical allen - cahn equation in   ( see , e.g. , @xcite for applications to fractional mean curvature flows ) . to obtain a functional on which a @xmath97-convergence problem is well - posed , we proceed as before , taking  @xmath247 as in  , and scaling  @xmath43 to @xmath247 in  : unlike the classical case , here it is also necessary to normalise by a multiplicative factor that depends on  @xmath22 , namely  @xmath274 if  @xmath21 , @xmath248 if  @xmath275 and  @xmath276 when  @xmath177 ( often , in fractional problems , a logarithmic correction at  @xmath177 is necessary to match the case  @xmath21 with the case  @xmath275 ) .",
    "this procedure leads to the following functional @xmath277      in this non - local setting for phase transitions , one may recover the @xmath97-convergence and density estimates results of theorem  [ sd9fffffff ] , though they now provide an alternative selection of local and non - local limit interfaces , according to the cases  @xmath21 and  @xmath278 .",
    "namely , the limit problem reduces to the @xmath22-perimeter functional - perimeter functional is defined only for  @xmath21 while the fractional allen - cahn equation for any  @xmath268 . ]",
    "when  @xmath21 and to the classical perimeter functional when  @xmath278 .",
    "this is somehow consistent with the fact that the @xmath22-perimeter reduces to the classical perimeter as  @xmath71 ( recall theorem  [ 888990 ] ) .",
    "also , from the point of view of the applications , it suggests that the limit interfaces of the non - local allen - cahn phase transition may be either local or non - local according to whether the fractional parameter  @xmath22 is above or below the critical threshold  @xmath228 ( that is , when  @xmath25 the nonlocal effect is lost by the limit interface ) . in further detail ,",
    "the result obtained reads as follows : and a careful analysis of the one - dimensional case was also performed in  @xcite . ]      * as  @xmath250 , @xmath279 @xmath97-converges to the @xmath22-perimeter functional when  @xmath21 and the classical perimeter functional when  @xmath278 * the following compactness property holds : if @xmath252)$ ] and @xmath280 then there exists  @xmath3 and a convergent subsequence such that  @xmath247 converges to  @xmath51 in  @xmath253 .",
    "* fixed  @xmath80 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 , if  @xmath247 minimises @xmath279 in  @xmath78 and @xmath261 then @xmath262 provided that  @xmath263 .",
    "also , @xmath264 approaches  @xmath3 uniformly in  @xmath86 , and  @xmath3 minimises either the @xmath22-perimeter or the classical perimeter in  @xmath86 with respect to its boundary data ( depending on whether  @xmath21 or  @xmath278 ) .",
    "we try to translate the statement of theorem  [ d88fdghjww ] into an evocative picture that involves the parameters  @xmath92 and  @xmath268 .",
    "namely , in figure  11 , @xmath22 ranges horizontally and  @xmath92 vertically ; on the top of the picture ( corresponding to the case  @xmath281 ) we have a phase transition function  @xmath247 whose level sets as @xmath250 approach some  @xmath39 , which is drawn in the bottom of the picture ( which corresponds to the case  @xmath282 ) .",
    "when  @xmath21 this  @xmath39 is an  @xmath22-minimal set , while for  @xmath278 it is a classical minimal surface ( since `` classical minimal surfaces are nice '' and `` @xmath22-minimal sets might be somewhat wild '' the picture is trying to distinguish between them by showing either smooth surfaces or singular cones ) .          as a matter of fact",
    ", the bottom of figure  11 should be reconsidered in the light of theorem  [ n ] : namely , at least when  @xmath232 , the @xmath22-minimal sets should not look as `` wild '' as they were depicted , at least for  @xmath231 ( and , when  @xmath137 , for any  @xmath21 , recall theorem  [ 2 ] ) : we try to take into account this further regularity property in figure  12 , by extending the picture of the `` nice '' surface down to an unknown exponent  @xmath283 .",
    "many outstanding mathematicians have given fundamental contributions to this problem and we can not do justice here to all the results obtained and of all the important generalisations performed ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a recent review on the topic ) : here we will just mention that conjecture  [ con ] is known to have an answer in the affirmative when  @xmath288 and in the negative when  @xmath289 . also , it is conceivable that conjecture  [ con ] was inspired by the relation between the phase transitions and the minimal surfaces ( recall theorem  [ sd9fffffff ] ) and by the rigidity and regularity features of the minimal surfaces .    of course , a natural question is whether or not results inspired by conjecture  [ con ] hold true when the classical allen - cahn equation   is replaced by the fractional allen - cahn equation  .",
    "this question was addressed in  @xcite when  @xmath137 and  @xmath177 , in  @xcite when  @xmath137 and  @xmath268 , in  @xcite when  @xmath290 and  @xmath177 and in  @xcite when  @xmath290 and  @xmath278 .",
    "we summarise these results in the following statement :    [ dg s ] let either @xmath291 or @xmath292 let  @xmath284 be a solution of the fractional allen - cahn equation   in the whole of  @xmath59 and suppose that  @xmath285 for all  @xmath286 .",
    "then @xmath43 is one - dimensional .",
    "clearly , theorem  [ dg s ] leaves many questions open .",
    "for instance , unlike the classical case , no counterexample is known in a higher dimension ( it is conceivable , but not trivial to prove , that the counterexample in  @xcite works for  @xmath289 and  @xmath278 ; the other ranges of  @xmath66 and  @xmath22 seem to be completely unknown ) .",
    "furthermore , the ranges in   and   are still rather mysterious .",
    "one may think that these ranges are somehow reminiscent of the limit behaviour of the interfaces , according to theorem  [ d88fdghjww ] . in this spirit",
    ", one may suspect that the symmetry result in theorem  [ dg s ] under condition   is a byproduct of the complete regularity theory of the minimisers of the related perimeter functionals ( i.e. , of the classical minimal surfaces when  @xmath278 , and of the @xmath22-minimal sets when  @xmath21 , by theorem  [ 2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , one may suspect that the threshold  @xmath177 of condition   is an offspring of the same threshold that appears in theorem  [ d88fdghjww ] , i.e. that the symmetry properties in theorem  [ dg s ] may break down in general when  @xmath21 due to the `` wilderness '' of the limit @xmath22-minimal sets .",
    "these arguments lead to the feeling that the threshold @xmath177 in   is optimal .    on the other hand",
    ", some other observations may lead to an opposite conclusion , that is the feeling that the threshold @xmath177 in   may be lowered a bit ( maybe in dimensions  @xmath293 ) .",
    "indeed , the proofs of theorem  [ dg s ] do not explicitly use any regularity properties of the ( possibly fractional ) minimal surfaces and the threshold @xmath177 in   does not come from geometric considerations but from analytical energy estimates .",
    "moreover , if any relation between symmetry results for phase transitions and regularity results for ( possibly fractional ) minimal surfaces really holds true , then these regularity results for @xmath22-minimisers hold true up to a threshold  @xmath294 , so it seems conceivable that the symmetry properties may hold even slightly below  @xmath177 at least when  @xmath287 ( recall theorem  [ n ] and figure  12 ) .",
    "so we believe that any further investigation into the possible regularity of the @xmath22-minimal sets and the possible symmetries of the monotone solutions of the fractional allen - cahn equation would be a pleasant challenge for the researchers involved and a welcome progress for mathematics ."
