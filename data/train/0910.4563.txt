    "the existence of astrophysical non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) has been established by its gravitational effect on galaxy rotation @xcite and the velocity dispersions of objects from dwarf galaxies @xcite through large galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "additional evidence of dm existence comes from cosmic microwave background measurements @xcite and gravitational lensing of galaxies by foreground galaxy clusters , for example , the evident separation of dark and baryonic matter in 1e0657 - 558 , the `` bullet cluster '' @xcite .    at present though , the existence of dark matter is solely inferred from its gravitational influence .",
    "the particle nature of dark matter is yet to be revealed through direct detection in terrestrial dark matter searches , its production in particle accelerators , or indirect dark matter searches looking for evidence of a flux of known particles produced by annihilation of dark matter particle pairs .",
    "here we report on an indirect dark matter search carried out using veritas located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona , usa , at an elevation of 1268 m @xcite .",
    "gamma rays can be produced either directly from the pair annhilation of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) or as secondary decay products from the primary particles produced in wimp annihilation .",
    "the former would produce a monoenergetic source of gamma rays equal to the wimp mass and would constitute definitive evidence for particle dark matter .",
    "the latter mechanism would produce a spectrum of gamma - ray energies with a cutoff at the wimp mass .    for astrophysical targets ,",
    "the wimp annihilation rate and associated gamma - ray flux are highly uncertain due to theoretical uncertainties and limited observational constraints on the dm halo profile .",
    "therefore , veritas has surveyed a variety of possible sources in its dark matter search .",
    "we present here results from observations of three dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) : draco , ursa minor , and willman 1 ; the globular cluster m5 ; and the local group galaxies m32 and m33 .",
    "the emphasis of the program has been to target dsphs due to their relative proximity and low expected background from known astrophysical gamma - ray sources .",
    "veritas can detect and measure gamma rays in the @xmath0100 gev - 30 tev energy range with an energy resolution of 15 - 20% , and angular resolution of @xmath1 per event .",
    "further technical description of veritas can be found in @xcite .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies typically have stellar velocity dispersions implying a high mass - to - light ( @xmath2 ) ratio indicative of their dynamics being dominated by dark matter",
    ". observations of the draco , ursa minor , and willman 1 dsph galaxies were performed in 2007 and 2008 in three and four telescope array configurations .",
    "details of the observations are summarized in table  [ tbl : obs ] .",

    "<S> a leading candidate for astrophysical dark matter ( dm ) is a massive particle with a mass in the range from 50 gev to greater than 10 tev and an interaction cross section on the weak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the self - annihilation of such particles in astrophysical regions of high dm density can generate stable secondary particles including very high energy gamma rays with energies up to the dm particle mass . </S>",
    "<S> dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the local group are attractive targets to search for the annihilation signature of dm due to their proximity and large dm content . </S>",
    "<S> we report on gamma - ray observations taken with the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) of several dwarf galaxy targets as well as the globular cluster m5 and the local group galaxies m32 and m33 . </S>",
