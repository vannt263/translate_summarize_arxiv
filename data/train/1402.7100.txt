    "the interest in spin dynamics operated by the electric current started with the suggestion @xcite to move domain walls in metals by the flow of spin - polarized electrons @xcite .",

    "slonczewski @xcite and berger @xcite demonstrated that a spin - polarized current could deliver a spin transfer torque that is sufficient to reorient the magnetic moment in a nanostructure .",
    "this suggestion triggered a wide - spread research on magnetic devices operated by spin - polarized currents @xcite .",
    "the field has progressed towards current - induced magnetization switching in the smallest nanostructures , including nanowires .",
    "the question we are addressing in this paper is whether some degree of the mechanical freedom of the nanostructure would assist or inhibit the process of the magnetization switching .",
    "this question may be of particular importance because electric currents needed to switch the magnetization are rather high .",
    "meanwhile , as is well known , the magnetization can be switched by the low amplitude high - frequency ac magnetic field .",
    "when absorbed in a resonant manner , it drives the magnetic moment up the energy barrier towards the reversal @xcite .",
    "the corresponding wavelengths of the electromagnetic field are typically in the centimeter range , making it difficult to selectively apply this method to small densely packed memory units .",
    "this prompted some researchers to use josephson junctions for generation of the ac field in a small magnet @xcite .",
    "the latter method , however , requires low temperatures .",
    "our work is motivated by the observation that , in the coordinate frame coupled to the magnetic anisotropy axes , the rotational vibrations of a magnet are equivalent to the ac magnetic field @xcite .",
    "consequently , for nanomechanical resonators with vibrational frequencies comparable to the frequency of the ferromagnetic resonance , the effect of rotational vibrations can be similar to the effect of the ac magnetic field . unlike the ac field",
    ", however , the mechanical vibrations can be localized at the nanoscale .",
    "the connection between the magnetization reversal and mechanical rotation has been known for almost a century .",
    "it is manifested in the barnett and einstein - de haas effects @xcite .",
    "coupling of mechanical resonators to classical magnetic moments has been studied in the past in the context of magnetization reversal in a thin magnetic film deposited on a microcantilever @xcite and nanomachines operated by the ac currents @xcite .",
    "einstein - de haas effect in a magnetic microcantilever has been measured @xcite and explained @xcite by the motion of a domain wall .",
    "various aspects of the electronic transport through magnetic molecules have been investigated together with the possibility of writing , storing , and reading spin information in memory devices based upon single - molecule magnets @xcite .",
    "switching of the molecular spin by a spin - polarized current through a molecule bridged between conducting leads has been proposed @xcite and the effect of a soft vibrating mode of the molecule on the electronic transport has been studied @xcite .",

    "we have studied the effect of torsional oscillations of the magnet on the magnetization switching induced by the spin - polarized electric current .",

    "it is , therefore , natural to ask whether the process can be assisted by other means . secondly , with various proposed designs of the magnetic memory operated by spin - polarized currents , it is not out of question that some magnetic elements would have a certain degree of mechanical freedom .",

    "our focus has been on the mechanically assisted magnetization switching ( mams ) that can reduce the minimal required current as compared to the slonczewski s limit .    in section",
    "[ mechanical ] we have shown that a mechanical kick alone , supplied to the oscillator , can switch the magnetization . in this case",

    "they transfer the angular momentum to the macrospin of the nanomagnet and drive it up the anisotropy barrier until the reversal occurs @xcite .",
    "as we have seen in section [ mechanical ] , torsional oscillations of the resonator have a similar effect on the magnetic moment .",
    "the conditions required for the magnetization reversal are that the angle of twist is suffiiently large and that the resonance frequency of the mechanical oscillator is comparable to the frequency of the ferromagnetic resonance .",

    "ghz nanomechanical oscillators are common .",
    "oscillation frequencies of hundreds of ghz have been reported in carbon nanotubes @xcite . even at lower frequencies ,",
    "however , one observation made in section [ current ] may be important for some of the existing devices that use spin - transfer torque to achieve the magnetization reversal .",
    "we have seen in the switching phase diagram that any degree of the mechanical freedom of the device may lead to its instability due to the chaotic coupled dynamics of the magnetic moment and the mechanical twist inside certain windows of the values of the parameters .",
    "this effect becomes progressively weaker , however , as the oscillator becomes heavier .    in the absence of the spin transfer torque delivered by the spin - polarized current",
    ", mams requires a large oscillation angle @xmath33 , which can be viewed as a trade - off for a large current needed without the mechanical assistance .",
    "the necessity of a large initial twist for the mams unassisted by the current is easy to understand by noticing that the effective ac magnetic field in the coordinate frame of the oscillator is proportional to the amplitude of the oscillations , @xmath119 . in section",
    "[ combined ] we have shown that combining the effect of the spins - polarized current with the effect of high - frequency mechanical oscillations one can reduce both , the critical current and the amplitude of the oscillations required for the switching .",

    "a fast mechanical twist can be supplied to the oscillator through features used in the existing nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) , by , e.g. , placing it in the electric field and delivering a field pulse simultaneously with a pulse of the spin - polarized electric current .",
    "while this may be a challenging task at the nanoscale , the fast progress of nanotechnology leaves no doubt about its feasibility .",
    "the exact realization of the proposed combined switching mechanism may be far from the one schematically depicted in fig .",

    "<S> switching of the direction of the magnetic moment in a nanomagnet is studied within a modified slonczewski s model that permits torsional oscillations of the magnet . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the latter may inhibit or assist the magnetization switching , depending on parameters . </S>",
    "<S> three regimes have been studied : the switching by torsional oscillations alone , the switching by the spin - polarized current with torsional oscillations permitted , and the magnetization switching by the current combined with the mechanical twist . </S>",
    "<S> we show that switching of the magnetic moment is possible in all three cases and that allowing torsional oscillations of the magnet may have certain advantages for applications . </S>",
    "<S> phase diagrams are computed that show the range of parameters required for the switching . </S>"
