    "a remarkable development was the creation of the first molecular condensate in an ultracold degenerate fermi gas@xcite , after which the condensation of fermionic pairs was soon detected and shown to be a superfluid @xcite .",
    "a relevant question in this fermionic context is if superfluidity can persist in a fermi gas with imbalanced spin population . in principle",
    ", superfluidity may still occur in a mismatched case , and some theories with unusual pairings and exotic phases have been proposed , such as the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase , among others @xcite .",
    "subsequently the search for experimental confirmation of these new phases has been conducted by different groups @xcite . until now , however , only paired and polarized phases have been detected in three dimensions .",
    "further remarkable developments have involved the optical confinement of ultracold atoms to one dimension ( 1d ) , whereby atoms are trapped and cooled in an array of 1d tubes .",
    "these systems include bosonic rb atoms @xcite and fermionic @xmath0k atoms @xcite .",
    "the most recent experimental breakthroughs involve 1d rb atoms in the attractive regime @xcite and the realization of a 1d spin - imbalanced attractive fermi gas of @xmath1li atoms under the degenerate temperature @xcite .",
    "this experimental work in 1d has highlighted the fundamental nature of exactly solvable models of quantum many - body systems .",
    "in particular , the bethe ansatz ( ba ) integrable models of lieb and liniger @xcite for spinless bosons and of yang @xcite and gaudin @xcite for two - component fermions . the experimental work has further highlighted the deep and enduring significance of the ba @xcite .",
    "more general ba integrable multi - component fermions were initially studied by sutherland @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine the ba integrable two- and three - component attractive 1d fermi gases with population imbalance .",
    "we shall see that these ultracold fermi gases may be used to create nontrivial and exotic phases of matter .",
    "they also pave the way for the direct observation and further study of fflo - like states .",
    "we begin by reviewing the exactly solved two - component model , with hamiltonian @xcite @xmath2 which describes @xmath3 @xmath4-interacting spin-@xmath5 fermions of mass @xmath6 constrained by periodic boundary conditions to a line of length @xmath7 and subject to an external magnetic field @xmath8 .",

    "this method was originally proposed by yang and yang @xcite for spinless bosons and received important contributions for fermions by takahashi @xcite , among others @xcite .",

    "the mixed phase can be considered as a 1d - analogue of the fflo phase ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "it is also expected that the analytical polylogarithmic function approach will play a central role in unifying the properties of attractive fermi gases of ultracold atoms with higher symmetries .",
    "for example , the tba equations for the 1d fermi gases with @xmath4-function attractive interactions and internal spin degrees of freedom may be reformulated according to the charge bound states and spin strings characterizing spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "thus for strong attraction , the spin fluctuations that couple to non spin - neutral charge bound states are exponentially small and can be asymptotically calculated @xcite . thus the low energy physics is dominated by density fluctuations among the charge bound states . the full phase diagrams and thermodynamics of the 1d attractive fermi gases",
    "can be analytically calculated via this polylogarithm function approach .",
