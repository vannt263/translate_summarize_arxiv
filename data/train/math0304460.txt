    "-5 mm    the results i will discuss are all motivated by the conjectures of physicists , without which it is hard to imagine that these results would have appeared . in all these cases the new methods discovered during the process to prove those conjectures often give us many more surprising new results .",
    "the common feature of the proofs is that they all depend on localization techniques built upon various parts of mathematics : modular forms , heat kernels , symplectic geometry , and various moduli spaces .",
    "elliptic genera were invented through the joint efforts of physicists and mathematicians @xcite . actually in section 2",
    "i will only discuss in detail a vanishing theorem of the witten genus , which is the index of the dirac operator on loop space .",
    "this is a loop space analogue of the famous atiyah - hirzebruch vanishing theorem .",
    "it was discovered in the process of understanding the witten rigidity conjectures for elliptic genera .",
    "a loop space analogue of a famous theorem of lawson - yau for non - abelian lie group actions will also be discussed .",
    "moduli spaces of flat connections on riemann surfaces have been studied for many years in various subjects of mathematics @xcite .",
    "the computations of the intersection numbers on such moduli spaces have been among the central problems in the subject . in section 3",
    "i will discuss a very effective way to compute the most interesting intersection numbers by using the localization property of heat kernels .",
    "this proves several beautiful formulas conjectured by witten @xcite .",
    "we remark that these intersection numbers include those needed for the verlinde formula .",
    "in section 4 i discuss some remarkable formulas about counting curves in projective manifolds , in particular in calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "i will discuss the mirror principle , a general method developed in @xcite-@xcite to compute characteristic classes and characteristic numbers on moduli spaces of stable maps in terms of hypergeometric series .",
    "the mirror formulas from mirror symmetry correspond to the computations of the euler numbers .",
    "mirror principle computes quite general hirzebruch multiplicative classes such as the total chern classes .",
    "-5 mm    let @xmath0 be a compact smooth spin manifold with a non - trivial @xmath1-action , @xmath2 be the dirac operator on @xmath0 .",
    "atiyah and hirzebruch proved that in such a situation the index of the dirac operator @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the hirzebruch @xmath5-genus @xcite .",
    "one interesting application of this result is that a @xmath6 surface does not allow any non - trivial smooth @xmath1-action , because it has non - vanishing @xmath5-genus .",
    "let @xmath7 be the loop space of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath7 consists of smooth maps from @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "there is a natural @xmath1-action on @xmath7 induced by the rotation of the loops , whose fixed points are the constant loops which is @xmath0 itself .",
    "witten formally applied the atiyah - bott - segal - singer fixed point formula to the dirac operator on @xmath7 , from which he derived the following formal elliptic operator @xcite :    @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a formal variable and for a vector bundle @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the symmetric operation and @xmath12 is the combinations of the symmetric products @xmath13 s by formal power series expansion .",
    "so @xmath14 , which is called the dirac operator on loop space , actually consists of an infinite series of twisted dirac operators with the pure dirac operator @xmath2 as the degree @xmath15 term .",
    "the index of @xmath14 , denoted by @xmath16 , is called the witten genus .",
    "the loop space analogue of our vanishing theorem is the following :    * theorem 2.1 : * ( @xcite ) _ let @xmath0 be a spin manifold with non - trivial @xmath1-action .",
    "assume @xmath17 for some integer @xmath18 , then the witten genus vanishes : @xmath19 . _",
    "here @xmath20 is the equivariant first pontrjagin class and @xmath21 is the generator of the cohomology group of the classifying space @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the natural projection from the borel construction .",
    "this theorem implies that under the extra condition on the first pontrjagin class , we have infinite number of elliptic operators with vanishing indices .",
    "the condition on the first equivariant pontrjagin class is equivalent to that the @xmath1-action preserves the spin structure of @xmath7 .",
    "if we have a non - abelian lie group acts on @xmath0 non - trivially , then for an @xmath1 subgroup , the condition @xmath24 is equivalent to @xmath25 which implies that @xmath7 is spin . as an easy consequence , we get :    * corollary 2.2 : * _ assume a non - abelian lie group acts on the spin manifold @xmath0 non - trivially and @xmath25 , then the witten genus , @xmath26 , vanishes . _",
    "this corollary should be considered as a loop space analogue of a result of lawson - yau in @xcite , which states that if a non - abelian lie group acts on the spin manifold @xmath0 non - trivially , then @xmath27 .",
    "our results motivated hoehn and stolz to conjecture that , for a compact spin manifold @xmath0 with positive ricci curvature and @xmath25 , the witten genus vanishes .",
    "so far all of the known examples have non - abelian lie group action , therefore our results applies",
    ". it should be interesting to see how to combine curvature with modular forms to get vanishing results .",
    "the proof of theorem 2.1 is an interesting combination of the atiyah - bott - segal - singer fixed point formula with jacobi forms .",
    "the magic combination of geometry and modular invariance implies the vanishing of the equivariant index of @xmath14 .",
    "similar idea can be used to prove many more rigidity , vanishing and divisibility results for @xmath14 twisted by bundles constructed from loop group representations .",
    "such operators can be viewed as twisted dirac operators on loop space .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite . in these cases",
    "the kac - weyl character formulas came into play .",
    "if we take the level @xmath28 representations of the loop group of the spin group in our general rigidity theorem , we get the witten conjectures on the rigidity of elliptic genera @xcite , which were proved by taubes @xcite , bott - taubes @xcite , hirzebruch @xcite , krichever , landweber - stong , ochanine for various cases .",
    "our method can actually go very far . recently in @xcite we proved rigidity and vanishing theorems for families of elliptic genera and the witten genus . in @xcite we proved similar theorems for foliated manifolds . in @xcite such theorems were generalized to orbifolds .",
    "more recently in @xcite we have proved a far general rigidity theorem for @xmath14 twisted by vertex operator algebra bundles .",
    "if we apply the modular invariance argument to the non - equivariant elliptic genera , we get a general formula which expresses the hirzebruch @xmath29-form in terms of the twisted @xmath5-forms @xcite .",
    "a @xmath30 dimensional version of this formula , due to alveraz - gaume and witten , called the miraculous cancellation formula , had played important role in the development of string theory .",

    "we first discuss the case when @xmath34 has one boundary component , @xmath31 is simply connected and the moduli space is smooth . a point in @xmath32",
    "is an equivalence class of flat connection on @xmath33 with holonomy @xmath21 around the boundary . in general",
    "we let @xmath36 denote the moduli space of flat connections on @xmath33 with holonomy around the boundary to be @xmath37 which is close to @xmath21 , or equivalently in the conjugacy class of @xmath38 .",
    "the following formula is essentially a refined version of the formula @xcite which witten derived from the path integrals on the space of connections .",
    "* theorem 3.1 : * ( @xcite , @xcite ) , _ we have the following identity : _ @xmath39    the notations in the above formula are as follows : @xmath40 is the canonical symplectic form on @xmath32 induced by poincare duality on @xmath34 ; @xmath41 is a pontrjagin class of the tangent bundle @xmath42 of the moduli space associated to the symmetric polynomial @xmath43 ; @xmath44 is the set of irreducible representations of @xmath31 identified as a lattice in @xmath45 which is the dual lie algebra of the maximal torus @xmath46 of @xmath31 ; @xmath47 where @xmath48 with respect to the killing form , and @xmath49 denotes the set of positive roots ; @xmath50 and @xmath51 are respectively the character and dimension of @xmath52 ; @xmath53 denotes the volume of @xmath31 with respect to the bi - invariant metric induced from the killing form ; @xmath54 denotes the number of elements in the center @xmath55 of @xmath31 and finally @xmath56 is the complex dimension of @xmath32 .    the starting point for",
    "the proof of this theorem is to use the holonomy model of the moduli space and the explicit heat kernel on @xmath31 .",
    "we consider the holonomy map @xmath57 with @xmath58z$ ] where @xmath59 is the conjugacy class through the generic point @xmath60 .",
    "it is well - known that the moduli space is given by @xmath61 where @xmath31 acts on @xmath62 by conjugation .",
    "we have the explicit expression for the heat kernel on @xmath31 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 are two points .",
    "the key idea is to consider the integral @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the induced bi - invariant volume form on @xmath67 .",
    "we compute @xmath68 in two different ways .",
    "first as @xmath69 , @xmath68 localizes to an integral on @xmath70 , which is the symplectic volume of @xmath36 with respect to the canonical symplectic form induced by the poincare duality on the cohomology groups of @xmath34 with values in the adjoint lie algebra bundle . to prove this we used the beautiful observation of witten @xcite that the symplectic volume form of @xmath36 is the same as the reidemeister torsion which arises from the gaussian integral in the heat kernel .    on the other hand",
    "the orthogonal relations among the characters of the representations of @xmath31 easily give us the infinite sum . in summary",
    "we have obtained the following more precise version of witten s beautiful formula for the symplectic volume of the moduli space ,    * proposition 3.2 : * ( @xcite ) _ as @xmath69 , we have _    @xmath71    here",

    "this is another key observation . by using the relation between the symplectic form on @xmath36 and that on @xmath32 , and then taking the limits we arrive at the formula in theorem 3.1 . for the details",
    "see @xcite and @xcite",
    ". another easy consequence of the method is that the symplectic volume of @xmath36 is a piecewise polynomial of degree at most @xmath79 in @xmath80 from which we get certain very general vanishing theorems for those integrals when the degree of the polynomial @xmath43 is relatively large @xcite .",
    "similar results for moduli spaces when @xmath34 has more boundary components can be obtained in the same way @xcite .",
    "more precisely , assume @xmath34 has @xmath81 boundary components and consider the moduli space of flat connections on the principal @xmath31 bundle @xmath33 with holonomy @xmath82 around the corresponding boundaries .",

    "recently the general verlinde formula has been directly derived along this line of idea @xcite .",
    "this localization method of using heat kernels can be applied to other general situation like moment maps , from which we derive the non - abelian localization formula of witten .",

    "this moduli space may have higher dimension than expected .",
    "even worse , its different components may have different dimensions . to define integrals on such space , we need the virtual fundamental cycle first constructed in @xcite and later in @xcite .",

    "a balloon manifold @xmath89 is a projective manifold with complex torus action and isolated fixed points .",
    "let @xmath112 be a basis of equivariant kahler classes .",
