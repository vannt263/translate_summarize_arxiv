    "one of the main goals of the high energy heavy - ion collision program is to look for the possible formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in the collision process",
    "the system may go through a phase transition from confined hadronic matter to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons which will be a transient state .",
    "the system then evolves from a very hot and dense qgp state to normal hadronic matter by undergoing cooling , expansion and hadronization .",
    "information obtained from various global observables ( e.g photon multiplicity ( @xmath0 ) , charged particle multiplicity ( @xmath1 ) and transverse energy ) is used to characterize the system formed in such collisions .",
    "study of photon production has shown a great promise in studying the various aspects of the reaction mechanism in such collisions and dynamics of particle production  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of photons in high energy physics experiments has been traditionally carried out using calorimeters . due to large spatial density of produced particles in the forward rapidity region in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions , and consequent overlap of showers",
    ", one can not use calorimeters beyond a certain region .",
    "in such a situation , a limited goal of photon study can be achieved using a preshower detector having a relatively thinner converter and restricting the development of shower .",
    "the preshower detector can only measure the spatial distribution of photons but not their energies .",
    "such a preshower photon multiplicity detector ( pmd ) has been employed in sps and rhic experiments and is planned also for the lhc experiment .",
    "in addition to extending the phase space coverage for the measurement of pseudorapidity distributions , the pmd data on spatial distribution of photons , along with other measurement of charged particle multiplicity and event centrality , has been able to address the following important physics topics related to phase transition and chiral symmetry restoration :    * determination of the reaction plane and the probes of thermalization via studies of azimuthal anisotropy and flow ; * critical phenomena near the phase boundary leading to fluctuations in global observables like multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions ; * signals of chiral - symmetry restoration ( e.g. disoriented chiral condensates ) through the measurement of charged - particle multiplicity ( @xmath2 ) also in a common part of phase space and study of the observables @xmath3 with full azimuthal coverage .",
    "the preshower detector for measuring photon multiplicity consists of a thin converter behind which is placed an array of sensitive detection elements ( cells or pads ) .",
    "the thickness of the converter is chosen such that it provides a reasonably large signal for electromagnetic particles , restricts shower size to a few cells and the response to charged hadrons is limited to preferably one pad or cell .",
    "the thickness of the converter and the granularity ( size , shape of one detection element ) have to be optimized using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "a second plane of similar granularity may be placed in front of the converter for improving the discrimination between charged hadrons and photons .",
    "the pmd for the fixed target sps experiments was made using plastic scintillator pads , with scintillation light being transported to readout devices using wavelength shifting fibers .",
    "the light at the fibre ends were converted to electrical signals and readout using the image intensifier ( ii ) and ccd camera systems obtained from the old ua2 experiment at cern .",
    "the basic parameters of the two detectors , used in the wa93 and wa98 experiments , are summarized in table  [ pmd - sps ] .",
    "these had only one plane of detection elements behind a 3  x@xmath4 thick lead converter .",
    "the first pmd , made for the wa93 experiment , consisted of 7500 plastic scintillator pads and had long wls fibers for transporting scintillation light to the ii+ccd camera readout system  @xcite .",

    "these were placed in four quadrants of a light - tight box , each quadrant having 1875 pads arranged in a matrix of 50  @xmath5  38 with a space for 5  @xmath5  5 pads left for the hole of the beam pipe .",
    "the fiber bundle from each quadrant was read out using one camera system .    the detector , mounted at 10.5 m from the target , covered the pseudorapidity region 2.8 @xmath6 5.2 of which the region 3.3@xmath74.9 had full azimuthal coverage .",

    "based on the experience gained during the operation of the wa93 pmd , the fabrication technology was modified for improvements in light collection and reduction of the distortion of the image at the ccd .",
    "the wls fibres of short length were coupled to long lengths of clear fibres to reduce light attenuation and a black paint was used in bundling the fibre ends to reduce spreading of the image on the ccd . to make the hit density nearly uniform over the detector ,",
    "four different pad sizes , ranging from 15 mm square to 25 mm square , were used , inner part having smaller pads and outer parts having larger pads .",

    "the pmd for the rhic and lhc colliders has been made in the form of honeycomb gas proportional counters using a novel concept of extended cathode . among the important studies at the sps are first observation of collective flow and a detailed study of localized charged - neutral fluctuation as a probe for dcc . in addition",
    "the pmd s contribution include study of pseudo - rapidity distributions of photons , scaling of photon multiplicity with number of participating nucleons , centrality dependence of @xmath46 of photons and event - by - event fluctuations in photon multiplicity .",
    "the pmd is taking data at the rhic collider and is expected to be installed in alice experiment at the lhc in 2007 . the rhic program has already paid dividends in the study of limiting fragmentation of identified particles . the study of dcc will be continued at the rhic using the pmd and the ftpc in star experiment and at the lhc using the pmd and the fmd in the alice experiment . at the lhc",
    ", larger multiplicity will be helpful in studying the event - by - event fluctuation in global observables with better precision .",
    "the experimental program for the study of quark - gluon plasma at cern and bnl is funded by the department of atomic energy and the department of science and technology of the government of india .",
    "in addition the program has also derived financial support from the university grants commission and the council of scientific and industrial research of the government of india , the star collaboration , the cern nms grants , and the indo - german exchange program in various stages of the work .",
    "we acknowledge the collaborative work of all the team members , past and present , of the wa93 collaboration , wa98 collaboration , star collaboration and alice collaboration .",
    "we acknowledge the extensive support received from the engineering and technical manpower and computer facility personnel at bnl and cern and also at all the collaborating institutions , namely vecc kolkata , iop bhubaneswar , panjab university chandigarh , university of rajasthan jaipur , university of jammu , jammu and gsi darmstadt .",
