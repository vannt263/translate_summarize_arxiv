    ". the origins of such variable emissions and mass - outflows from the vicinity of the black holes are also numerous .",
    "the accretion luminosity depends on the adopted accretion models and its accretion rates . when the accretion rate is not too high , the luminosity is directly proportional to the accretion rate and can be described successfully by the standard thin - disc model ( shakura - sunyaev , hereafter s - s , model ) @xcite .",
    "the standard model have been proven to be successful in studying the cataclysmic variables and later for neutron stars and black holes . however ,",
    "for highly luminous accretion discs whose luminosity exceeds the eddington luminosity as is found in the black hole candidate ss 433 or for very low luminous discs compared with the predicted accretion rate as the case of the supermassive black hole candidate sgr a * , the s - s model is not valid and alternative thick disc models , such as the slim disc model @xcite , the advection - dominated accretion disc model @xcite and the low angular momentum disc model @xcite , have been developed .",
    "numerous studies of the hot thick accretion flow around the black holes have been carried out both theoretically and numerically to promote the insights of the black hole physics .",
    "one of the important results of the hot accretion flows is that the inflow and outflow rates in the accretion flow follow a power - law function of radius . to explain the inflow - outflow rate versus radius relation , two types of models of the adiabatic inflow - outflow solution @xcite and the convection - dominated accretion flow model @xcite",
    "have been proposed .",
    "furthermore , the recent hydrodynamical ( hd ) and magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations result in new findings of such outflows , winds and jets in the field of hot accretion flows around the black holes @xcite .",
    "the details of the geometrically thick hot accretion flows are referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hot accretion flows show unstable behaviors of the outflows in most cases of the time - dependent numerical simulations . we have examined the thick accretion flows with low angular momentum and found that the outflows from the outermost boundary are always unstable , accompanying irregularly eruptive mass ejections @xcite .",
    "although we interpreted the unstable mass - outflow to be induced by the irregular radial oscillations of the centrifugally supported shock , the intrinsic origin of the unstable nature of mass - outflows is still an open question . in this paper ,",
    "focusing on the outflows from the hot accretion flow , we examine the unstable nature of the outflows in terms of the kelvin - helmholtz instability , using time - dependent 2d hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "finally , following the results of the unstable mass - outflow , we suggest a possible model which may explain the flaring events of sgr a*.",

    "we neglect the radiation transport assuming that the flow is optically thin .    in the equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ,",
    "we assume that all of the viscous dissipation energy is given to ions because an ion particle is much heavier than an electron particle and it is poorly known how the viscous dissipation energy is shared between the ions and electrons . however , as a representative case , we examined what result is obtained when half of the dissipation energy is shared to the electron and observed that the total luminosity is altered maximumly by a small factor of 1.5 due to the larger electron temperature in the intermediate region on the equator , although the mass - outflow rate is not altered largely .",

    "in particular , the variation for first one is less than 20 @xmath79 and for second one is by a factor of few . here , the luminosities are mainly dominated by the bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the mass - outflow rates increase with the increasing viscosity and conversely the luminosities decrease especially in the case of the maximum viscosity with @xmath80 . due to the viscous heating ,",
    "ion temperature becomes higher and therefore , the shock wave near the z - axis is pushed outward .",
    "hence , the outflow over the oblique shock is enhanced as seen in fig .  2 .",
    "on the other hand , the electron temperature behind the shock becomes lower when the shock is pushed away . as the dominant energy emission process is due to the free - free emission which mostly depends on the electron temperature behind the shock , the luminosity evetually becomes lower by a small factor .",
    "we wonder why the mass - outflow rates are considerably modulated chaotically in spite of the small modulations of the luminosity . to understand the outflow activity , it is useful to follow the animation of the time - dependent density and temperature contours .",

    "we have examined that the mass - outflows in the geometrical thick accretion flows such as cases a , b and c are generally unstable and the mass - outflow rates vary by more than a factor of few up to ten . in cases of a and b , the apparent origin of the outflow activity is ascribed to the formation of hot blobs and its evolution toward the outer boundary .",
    "we have examined such modulations of the mass - outflow rate in other simulations of 2d rotating accretion flows around a stellar - mass ( @xmath111 ) and a supermassive ( @xmath112 ) black holes over a wide range of input accretion rates as @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "in addition , examining 2d simulations for the disc of ss 433 at super - eddington luminosities , we found remarkable modulations of the accretion rate near the inner edge that results in the formation of recurrent hot blobs with high temperatures and low densities at the disc plane .",
    "based on this observation , we proposed that this may explain the massive jet ejection as well as the qpos phenomena observed in ss 433 @xcite .",
    "what is the intrinsic origin of the unstable nature of the outflows which is relevant to the hot blobs ? in this respect , we consider shear instability or kelvin - helmholtz instability that may lead to the hot blobs and the winding waves of density .",
    "the shear instability and the kelvin - helmholtz instability can generally occur when there exists a velocity shear in a single continuous fluid or if there is a velocity difference across the interface between two fluids .",

    "certainly , in cases a and b , there exists an interface between the outgoing flow and the downward accreting gas as the shock surface with discontinuous velocities and densities and the hot blobs are formed along this interface and are evolved toward the upper shocked region . for case c , the hot blobs exist along the interface between the outflow and the outer surface of the torus disc .",
    "therefore , the kelvin - helmholtz instability generated at the interface may be developed into the hot blobs and the winding waves .",

    "the unstable mass - outflow activities examined in this work demonstrate both small and large amplitude modulations of the total luminosity and the mass - outflow rate which seems to be relevant for explaining the flaring phenomena observed in sgr a*. the total luminosity found in cases b and c satisfactorily explains the existence of low luminosity of @xmath147 erg s@xmath71 for sgr a*. similarly , the irregularly eruptive mass - outflows may correspond to the flare activities of sgr a*.    the observations of sgr a * show that the duration of the x - ray and ir flares are typically of 1 - 3 hours and the flare events usually occurs few times per day . in the simulation of cases",
    "b and c , we find that the duration and the interval between the successive eruptive mass - outflows roughly are in agreement with the flares of sgr a*. but , the small modulations of luminosity does not correspond to the large amplitudes of the flare intensities observed at various wavelengths , because the amplitudes at radio , ir and x - ray are roughly varied by factors of 1/2 , 1 - 5 and 45 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the sub - milimeter flare lags the x - ray flare roughly by two hours . from these facts ,",
    "we propose a possible model of the unstable mass - outflow applicable to the flare phenomena of sgr a*. this is basically a scenario of the temporal sequence of disc - jet coupling observed in the x - rays , irs and radio wavelengths of the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 @xcite . here , we consider that the total emission in our models corresponds to the permanent emission of the quiescent state of sgr a * , whereas only the emission of sgr a * flare is produced at the distant region far away from the sgr a * through the interaction between the surrounding dense interstellar matter and the high - velocity jets .",
    "these jets are originated in the unstable mass - outflows as examined here .",
    "the ejected wind carries sufficient outflowing mass of rate @xmath148 ",
    "@xmath149 g s@xmath71 and a total kinematic energy of @xmath147 @xmath150 erg s@xmath71 to reproduce the flare phenomena .",
    "however , one needs to incorporated other mechanisms also so that the high - velocity wind could be accelerated up to the relativistic speed .",
    "this is because the outflow velocities at the outer boundary in cases b and c are limited to sub - relativistic regime as @xmath151 .",
    "when we consider the flare activities of sgr a * , it is required for us to treat mhd model because it is widely believed that the existence of the magnetic field is inevitable from the spectral analyses of sgr a * and that magnetic turbulence induced by magneto - rotationa l instability is responsible for the angular momentum transfer . in this respect , by analogy with the coronal mass ejection on the sun , youan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) proposed a mhd model for the formation of episodic jets from black holes associated with the closed magnetic fields in an accretion flow . in their model ,",
    "shear and turbulence of the accretion flow deform the field and result in th formation of a flux rope in the corona and the flux rope is ejected through the magnetic reconnection process in a current sheet under the magnetic field .",
    "although the unstable outflows examined here are restricted to the non - magnetized accretion flow , we notice that the comparative studies of 2d hydrodynamical and magneto - hydrodynamical accretion flows from a same thick torus around black holes show many similarities such as highly time - dependent accretion rate and kelvin - helmholtz instability in spite of the different mechanism of angular momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "they also show that , for strong magnetic field , a small fraction of outflows near the pole is escaped as a powerful mhd wind , whereas the outflows in the hydrodynamical simulations are bound .",
    "this suggests that the unstable nature of the outflows from the thick accretion flow may be furthermore enhanced in 2d magneto - hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "we examined the mass - outflow in the hot geometrically thick accretion flows such as the low angular momentum accretion flow and the advection - dominated accretion flow around black holes , using 2d time - dependent hd calculations .",
    "the results are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) in the low angular momentum flows , the inward accreting matter on the equatorial plane interacts with the outward moving gas and the centrifugally supported oblique shock is formed along the interface of both the flows provide the viscosity parameter @xmath0 is as small as @xmath1 .",
    "the hot blobs , which lead to the eruptive mass - outflow , are generated at the inner shocked region and grow up toward the outer boundary .",
    "\\(2 ) the advection - dominated accretion flows attain finally to a torus disc with the inner edge of the disc at @xmath152 and the center at @xmath3 .",
    "the hot blobs are formed near the inner edge of the torus disc and grow up along the outer surface of the disc .",
    "\\(3 ) in both models , the mass - outflow is unstable and eruptive in nature . as a result ,",
    "the luminosity and the mass - outflow rate are modulated irregularly and especially the relative modulation amplitudes @xmath153 of the mass - outflow rate are as large as a few to ten .",
    "\\(4 ) the origin of the unstable mass - outflow is ascribed to the kelvin - helmholtz instability which is ascertained by examining the richardson number criterion ( eq .",

    "\\(5 ) the flare phenomena of sgr a * may be explained by the unstable mass - outflow examined here , together with the scenario of the temporal sequence of disc - jet coupling observed in the x - rays , irs and radio wavelengths of the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "the unstable mass - outflow seems to be inevitable as far as we consider the thick accretion flows with small angular momentum around the black holes .",
    "the present study shows that both the models of the low angular momentum accretion flow and the advection - dominated accretion flow produce the eruptive mass - outflows .",
    "these models would reproduce the reasonable spectra fitted to the observed ones of sgr a * if we take in the appropriate model parameters , such as the accretion rate @xmath67 , the viscous parameter @xmath0 , the magnetic field strength @xmath34 and a hybrid electron population of thermal and nonthermal particles , following the idea and method described by @xcite .",
    "further , the evidence of angular momentum would confirm the validity of the models .",
    "moreover , it is required to perform magneto - hydrodynamical research instead of only the hydrodynamical one .",
    "this is because the magnetic field will play important roles not only in the small - scale region of the accretion flow but also the large - scale of the interstellar space ."
