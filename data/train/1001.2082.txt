    "the nonlinear effects are important in medical ultrasound and also plays a role in diagnostic program .",
    "some of diagnostic ultrasound instruments have implemented harmonic imaging into their devices by receiving the harmonics in the reflected ultrasound caused by nonlinear distortion of the signal propagating through the biological tissue .",
    "meanwhile , we should pay attention to observing hygienic limits of ultrasound exposition to avoid heating the unwanted tissue .",
    "the ability to predict the effects of nonlinear ultrasound propagation therefore becomes important .",
    "numerical simulations are currently the best means of making predictions of nonlinear ultrasound propagation .",
    "two of the numerical techniques suitable for providing solutions to the propagation problem are the finite difference time domain(fdtd ) method@xcite and the discrete exterior calculus(dec)@xcite .",
    "the westervelt equation is a model for the propagation of finite amplitude ultrasound , deriving from the equation of fluid motion by keeping up to quadratic order terms@xcite . in this paper , an conditional stable scheme for this equation using the techniques in dec",
    "is proposed .",
    "a significant advantage of this scheme is that it can be used to find numerical solutions on the discrete space manifold and the time , therefore is a generation of fdtd . in order to refine the space mesh to improve the accuracy of the solution given by the this scheme",
    ", the amount of work involved increases rapidly , since the length of time step should also be reduced .",
    "hence , two unconditional stable schemes are also proposed , namely the implicit and semi - implicit dec schemes for westervelt equation on manifold .",

    "the weservelt equation can be written in the following form : @xmath31 where @xmath27 is the acoustic pressure , @xmath32 is the are the ambient density , and @xmath33 is the ultrasound speed , @xmath34 is the diffusivity of ultrasound , @xmath35 is the coefficient of nonlinearity .    for some situations ,",
    "a source having azimuthal symmetry about its axis is considered . in this case ,",
    "2d triangular discrete manifold as the space is only need to be considered . and the eq.(2 ) on 3d space manifold and the time can also be solved numerically , using a similar approach .    the temporal partial derivatives with discrete differences , which can be obtained from taylor series expansions about each node of the computational mesh .",
    "temporal derivatives present in eq.(2 ) can be calculated as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the time step length , @xmath38 is the time coordinate .",

    "@xmath41 @xmath42    the higher order accuracy scheme for temporal derivatives can also be used in schemes(3 - 5 ) .",
    "the first two terms in ( 2 ) describe linear wave propagation at the small - signal sound speed .",
    "the third term describes the loss due to he viscosity and thermal conduction of the media .",
    "the fourth term describes the nonlinear distortion of the traveling wave due to amplitude effects . since the coefficients of third and fourth terms in eq.(2 )",

    "therefore , the stable condition for the wave equation @xmath45 is need to be satisfied .",
    "the wave equation can be discretized as @xmath46 the stable condition condition for scheme ( 6)@xcite is @xmath47 in fig.2 , the inequality ( 7 ) reduces to @xmath48 which is the stable condition for scheme ( 6 ) on square grid . the analysis of unconditional stability for schemes ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) can also be proved as the wave equations .    by the definition of truncation error ,",
    "the exact solutions of westervelt equation satisfy the same relation as schemes ( 3 - 5 ) except for an additional term @xmath49 .",
    "this expresses the consistency , and so the convergence for schemes ( 3 - 5 ) by lax equivalence theorem ( consistency @xmath50 stability @xmath51 convergence ) .",
    "the derivative in eq.(2 ) is approximated by first order difference in schemes ( 3 - 5 ) .",
    "equivalently , @xmath27 is approximated by linear interpolation function .",
    "this is to say that schemes ( 3 - 5 ) have first order spacial and temporal accuracy , according to the definition about accuracy of finite volume method .",
    "the dec schemes ( 3 - 5 ) for westervelt equation was implemented in c++ .",
    "the implementation consists of the following steps :    * set the simulation parameters .",
    "these are the dimensions of the computational mesh and the size of the time step , etc . ;",
    "* set the propagating media parameters .",
    "* initialize the mesh indexes . *",
    "assign current transmitted signal . *",
    "compute the value of all spatial nodes and temporarily store the result in the circular buffer for further computation . *",

    "not every simulation step needs to be visualized , especially when the time step size is too small .",
