    "the case @xmath70 follows immediately from the nonplanarity of @xmath71 ; we have included this value in the statement for completeness .      independently of the intrinsic value of learning some exact pagenumbers ,",
    "the importance of theorem  [ thm : exact1 ] is that we need these results in order to establish the following general result .",

    "although our techniques do not yield the exact value of @xmath80 for other values of @xmath0 , they give lower and upper bounds that imply sharp asymptotic estimates :    [ thm : main2 ] let @xmath81 be positive integers .",

    "theorem  [ thm : main2 ] gives the exact asymptotic value of this quotient .    in a nutshell ,",
    "the strategy to prove the lower bounds in theorems  [ thm : main1 ] and  [ thm : main2 ] is to establish lower bounds for @xmath80 obtained under the assumption that @xmath85 can not be @xmath0-page embedded ( for some integer @xmath86 ) .",
    "these results put the burden of the proof of the lower bounds in theorems  [ thm : main1 ] and  [ thm : main2 ] in finding good estimates of @xmath87 . for @xmath88 ( theorem  [ thm : main1 ] ) , these come from theorem  [ thm : exact1 ] , whereas for @xmath89 ( theorem  [ thm : main2 ] ) these are obtained from  @xcite*theorem 5 , which gives general estimates for such integers @xmath87 .",
    "the lower bounds for @xmath80 needed for both theorems  [ thm : main1 ] and  [ thm : main2 ] are established in section  [ sec : lower ] .    in section  [ sec : upper ] we prove the upper bounds on @xmath80 claimed in theorems  [ thm : main1 ] and  [ thm : main2 ] . to obtain these bounds ,",
    "first we find a particular kind of @xmath0-page embeddings of @xmath67 , which we call _ balanced _ embeddings .",
    "these embeddings are inspired by , although not equal to , the embeddings described by enomoto et al .  in  @xcite .",
    "we finally use these embeddings to construct drawings of @xmath80 with the required number of crossings .    using the lower and upper bounds derived in sections  [ sec : lower ] and  [ sec : upper ] , respectively , theorems  [ thm : main1 ] and  [ thm : main2 ] follow easily ; their proofs are given in section  [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "as we mentioned above , we found no general upper bounds for @xmath6 in the literature .",
    "we came across a rather natural way of drawing @xmath7 in @xmath0 pages , that yields the general upper bound given in the following statement .",
    "[ thm : upp1 ] let @xmath90 be nonnegative integers .",
    "let @xmath91 mod @xmath0 and @xmath92 mod @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath93    the proof of this statement is given in section  [ sec : cons ] .",
    "as we have already observed , for every even integer @xmath0 , every @xmath0-page drawing can be regarded as a @xmath63-planar drawing .",
    "thus , for every graph @xmath1 , @xmath94 .    since there is ( at least in principle ) considerable more freedom in a @xmath63-planar drawing than in a @xmath0-page drawing , it is natural to ask whether or not this additional freedom can be translated into a substantial saving in the number of crossings . for small values of @xmath32 or @xmath33 ,",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "indeed , beineke  @xcite described how to draw @xmath95 in @xmath96 planes without crossings , but by proposition  [ pro : extw ] , @xmath97 can not be @xmath0-page embedded ; thus the @xmath96-planar crossing number of @xmath95 is @xmath98 , whereas its @xmath0-page crossing number can be arbitrarily large . thus it makes sense to ask about the asymptotic behaviour when @xmath99 , and @xmath33 all go to infinity . letting @xmath100 , we focus on the question : is @xmath101 ?",
    "since we do not know ( even asymptotically ) the @xmath63-planar or the @xmath0-page crossing number of @xmath7 , we can only investigate this question in the light of the current best bounds available .",
    "in section  [ sec : conrem ] we present a discussion around this question .",
    "we conclude that if the @xmath63-planar and the @xmath0-page crossing numbers ( asymptotically ) agree with the current best upper bounds , then indeed the limit above equals @xmath19 .",
    "we also observe that this is not the case for complete graphs : the currently best known @xmath63-planar drawings of @xmath8 are substantially better ( even asymptotically ) than the currently best known @xmath0-page drawings of @xmath8 .",
    "we start by observing that for every integer @xmath33 , the graph @xmath3 can be embedded in @xmath66 pages , and so the pagenumber @xmath102 of @xmath65 is at most @xmath66 .",
    "thus we need to show the reverse inequality @xmath103 , for every @xmath4 .",
    "it clearly suffices to show that @xmath104 , for every @xmath4 .",
    "these inequalities are equivalent to @xmath0-colorability of certain auxiliary graphs . to this end",
    ", we define an auxiliary graph @xmath105 associated with a @xmath19-page ( circular ) drawing @xmath106 of @xmath7 as follows .",
    "the vertices of @xmath105 are the edges of @xmath7 , and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding edges cross in the drawing @xmath106",
    ".    we immediately have the following result , that is essentially due to buchheim and zheng  @xcite .",
    "[ lemma : chromatic ] one has @xmath107 if and only if the chromatic number of @xmath105 is greater than @xmath0 for all circular drawings @xmath106 of @xmath7 .    as a consequence we may decide if @xmath107 by considering all possible circular drawings @xmath106 of @xmath7 , and computing the chromatic numbers of the associated auxiliary graphs @xmath105 .",
    "the number of distinct circular drawings of @xmath7 may be computed using the classical _ orbit counting lemma _",
    ", often attributed to burnside , although it was certainly already known to frobenius .",
    "let a finite group @xmath108 act on a finite set @xmath109 denote by @xmath110 for @xmath111 the set of elements of @xmath112 fixed by @xmath113 then the number @xmath114 of orbits of @xmath108 on @xmath112 is the average , over @xmath115 of @xmath116 i.e. @xmath117    we will apply this lemma by considering that a circular drawing of @xmath7 is uniquely determined by the ordering of the @xmath32 blue and @xmath33 red vertices on a circle .",
    "we therefore define the finite set @xmath118 as the set of all @xmath119 such orderings .",

    "orderings are the same , i.e.  correspond to the same circular drawing of @xmath7 , if they belong to the same orbit of @xmath121 .",

    "we say that the white point @xmath52 has been _ converted into a @xmath231-cluster_.    to construct a @xmath0-page drawing of @xmath3 , we start by choosing ( any ) @xmath181 white points , and then convert each of these @xmath181 white points into an @xmath232-cluster . finally , convert each of the remaining @xmath183 white points into an @xmath233-cluster .",

    "white_. we describe the required embedding using the circular model .",
    "thus , we start with @xmath252 pairwise disjoint copies of a circle ; these copies are the pages @xmath253 . in the boundary of each copy we place the @xmath254 vertices , so that the vertices are placed in an identical manner in all @xmath252 copies .",
    "each edge will be drawn in the interior of the circle of exactly one page , using the straight segment joining the corresponding vertices .",
    "we now describe how we arrange the white and the black points on the circle boundary .",
    "we use the black - and - white arrangement proposed by enomoto et al .",
    "we refer the reader to figure  [ fig : rough1 ] .",

    "0.3 cm 0.3 cm 0.3 cm 0.3 cm 0.3 cm    it is a tedious but straightforward task to check that this yields an @xmath242-page embedding of @xmath241 .",
    "moreover , since every white vertex has load at least @xmath19 in every page , it follows immediately that the embedding is balanced .",
    "[ lem : corone ] for all positive integers",

    "we now describe a quite natural construction to draw @xmath7 in @xmath0 pages , for every @xmath296 .",
    "actually , our construction also works for the case @xmath70 , and for this case the upper bounds obtained coincide with the best known upper bound for @xmath42 .    for simplicity , we color the @xmath32 vertices black , and the @xmath33 vertices white .",
    "let @xmath297 be the nonnegative integers defined by the conditions @xmath298 and @xmath299 , and @xmath300 and @xmath301 ( note that the definitions of @xmath52 and @xmath166 coincide with those in the statement of theorem  [ thm : upp1 ] ) .",
    "our task is to describe a drawing of @xmath7 with exactly @xmath302 crossings .",

    "it seems worth gathering in a single expression the best lower and upper bounds we now have for @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath6 may exhibit an exceptional behaviour for small values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , it makes sense to express the asymptotic forms of these bounds .",

    "thus remains the question : can this additional freedom be used to ( substantially ) save crossings ? with this last question in mind ,",
