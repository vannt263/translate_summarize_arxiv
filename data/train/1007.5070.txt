    "regardless of the favored mechanism , two basic requirements for forming planets in a circumstellar disk must be satisfied : there must be enough material ( gas and dust ) in the right locations and a sufficient amount of time for the formation mechanism to operate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the former criterion amounts to a density threshold , suggesting that observational constraints on the spatial distribution of mass in young circumstellar disks are fundamental in constructing an empirical foundation for planet formation models .",
    "moreover , those same estimates of disk densities can be used to help characterize the viscous accretion process that determines how disk structures evolve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "their mass contents must be inferred from trace species , particularly from the dust grains that dominate the disk opacity . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the thermal continuum emission from these dust grains is optically thin and therefore provides an unique probe of mass in the disk midplane @xcite .",
    "if that emission can be resolved , properly interpreted with radiative transfer calculations , and assigned some nominal gas - to - dust mass ratio , it can be used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of disk densities .",
    "interferometric observations of dust and trace gas species have helped quantify densities in the outer parts of circumstellar disks @xcite , clearly established the presence of vertical temperature and density gradients @xcite , and even identified disks with large central cavities that exhibit very little dust emission @xcite .    in a previous study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we presented the initial part of a high angular resolution ( 03 @xmath11au ) survey of the 880@xmath1 m thermal dust emission from protoplanetary disks in the nearby ophiuchus star - forming region . to take advantage of these observations that are sensitive to the mass content inside the planet formation zone ( @xmath12au )",
    ", we developed a radiative transfer modeling toolkit to extract the two - dimensional temperature and density structures of these disks through a combined fit of their millimeter continuum visibilities and broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . through that modeling effort",
    ", we concluded that the disks had densities comparable to those expected for the outer parts of the primordial disk around the sun and very similar radial density gradients .",
    "the inferred density gradients indicate that whatever mechanism is responsible for generating viscosity in these disks acts with a nearly linear radial distribution ( i.e. , the viscosities vary as @xmath13 , with a median @xmath14 ) .",
    "moreover , we resolved large regions ( @xmath15 - 40au ) with very little millimeter emission in the centers of several disks , and speculated that these may be the signposts of young planetary systems .",
    "however , that initial sample was biased towards the targets that are exceptionally bright at millimeter wavelengths , and therefore considerably more massive than the typical disk in the ophiuchus region ( see * ? ? ? * ) . in this article , we extend the survey to double the sample and probe disk structures with millimeter luminosities down to the median value for @xmath21myr - old t tauri stars . in ",

    "candidates were selected based on the single - dish photometry compiled by @xcite .",

    "after this initial cut , we excluded targets that lacked sufficient information about their central stars . without stellar temperatures and luminosities , it is not possbile to interpret the observed millimeter data in detail ( see  3 ) . in practice , this second criterion amounted to an extinction threshold @xmath16 , as spectral classifications and luminosity estimates are rare and uncertain for more deeply embedded sources @xcite .",
    "the sample selection - space set by these criteria is shown in figure [ sample ] , with red points marking the selected target disks .",
    "the 880@xmath1 m flux densities for those points correspond to the values derived from the sma observations described here or in paper i. one selected target , wl 18 , falls below the designated millimeter emission threshold : previous 1.3 mm data led us to expect a larger 880@xmath1 m flux density than was observed .",
    "one other target , rx j1633.9@xmath102422 , meets the selection criteria but was not observed : its millimeter flux density was only recently published @xcite .",

    "high resolution maps of the continuum emission were created with a briggs robust = 0.2 - 0.7 weighting scheme for the visibilities , and maps of the co @xmath21=3@xmath102 line emission were made with natural weighting for the compact array data only .",

    "this dust structure is then irradiated by a central star of fixed temperature and luminosity to determine an internally - consistent disk temperature structure , using the two - dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code radmc @xcite .",
    "the results of the monte carlo simulation are then coupled with a post - processing raytracing code to compute a synthetic dataset for a given viewing geometry , consisting of both a broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and a set of millimeter continuum visibilities that sample the fourier plane in the same way as the sma data .",

    "the stellar properties used to generate the kurucz spectra that irradiate the disk structures are listed in table [ stars_table ] , based on both literature measurements and matches to the optical / near - infrared sed . because the spatio - kinematic information from the co line emission in these disks is sufficiently contaminated by the local cloud material , estimates of the disk inclinations and position angles were determined solely from the elliptical gaussian fits to the continuum emission described in  2 .",
    "unfortunately , the relatively faint continuum signals from some of these targets leads to considerable uncertainty in these viewing geometry estimates . these are still the best values available , but we caution that some systematic uncertainty will remain for the density parameters until better emission line data are available for these targets . with such a limited amount of spatially resolved information about the two components in the doar 24 e system ,",
    "a detailed modeling of this source is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "some important modifications to the modeling process were made for the sr 24 s disk , with the details provided in  4.2 .",

    "the latter two panels have the best - fit model behavior overlaid in red , and the sed panel also shows the input stellar spectrum as a dashed blue curve . because of its large central emission cavity , the modeling results for the sr 24 s disk are shown separately in figure [ results_trans ] , with inset images synthesized at higher angular resolution to facilitate a more detailed comparison .",
    "the modeling uncertainties and relationships between the observations and model parameters were already discussed in detail in paper i , so we will not repeat that effort here . instead , we focus on how this expanded sample enables new constraints on the spatial distribution of mass in @xmath21myr - old circumstellar disks .",

    "the light gray band inside 20au marks the survey resolution limit , while the dark gray boxes are reference points representing the minimal surface densities ( with uncertainties ) and presumed feeding zones for saturn , uranus , and neptune in the canonical model for the primordial solar disk @xcite .",
    "although the disks in this sample exhibit a wide range of masses ( @xmath27 ; figure [ histograms]a ) and characteristic radii ( @xmath26 ; figure [ histograms]c ) , we find a very narrow distribution of values for @xmath29 , the radial gradient of the surface density profile .",
    "as shown in figure [ histograms]b , that distribution is roughly normal with a peak at @xmath35 and a standard deviation of 0.2 . since that width is comparable to the modeling uncertainties on @xmath29 for an individual source ( @xmath20.2 - 0.3 ; paper i ) , the modeling results are consistent with a uniform @xmath29 value being representative of the entire sample .",

    "] moreover , by extending the survey to cover much fainter targets , we have confirmed that the shape of the surface density profile does not significantly change over a wide range of millimeter luminosities ( or disk masses ) .    despite the similar radial density gradients in these disks , the observations clearly show a wide variety of millimeter emission morphologies .",
    "some of that diversity is related to how the disks are heated by their central stars , a natural outcome of the assortment of stellar properties and vertical distributions of dust present in the sample ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "however , the density profiles plotted in figure [ sigma ] demonstrate that a significant range of characteristic radii and masses are also partly responsible .",
    "a close examination of those @xmath36 profiles reveals that the brighter disks at millimeter wavelengths tend to have both higher masses and larger characteristic radii .",
    "the former is no surprise , since the vast majority of the disk volume at these wavelengths is optically thin , but there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect the disk sizes to be correspondingly smaller for fainter sources .",
    "this relationship is not a modeling artifact , as there is an analogous empirical correlation between the brightness of the millimeter emission and how well that emission is resolved .",
    "figure [ median_vis ] demonstrates this explicitly by comparing the average 880@xmath1 m visibility profiles for disks that are brighter ( _ red _ ) or fainter ( _ blue _ ) than 0.5jy .",
    "these profiles were calculated by averaging the visibilities for each subset of disks into annular bins , after deprojecting the visibilities for individual disks according to their viewing geometries and normalizing their real ( correlated ) fluxes by dividing off their integrated flux densities .",
    "this comparison confirms that the millimeter emission from the brighter disks in this sample is more resolved by our sma data , exhibiting substantially less correlated flux on essentially all spatial scales .",
    "although the physical origins of this empirical relationship are not obvious , some speculations about its significance for understanding the viscous evolution process in these disks are presented in  5 .    in an effort to identify any trends among the disk structures or the characteristics of their stellar hosts , we performed a principle component analysis on a subset of such properties for the 12 disks with continuous density distributions in this sample .",
    "the analysis included the 5 free disk structure parameters , \\{@xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath26 , @xmath37 , @xmath31 } , the stellar properties \\{@xmath38 , @xmath39 } , and the accretion rates , @xmath40 ( see tables [ stars_table ] , [ structure_table ] , and [ viscous_table ] ) .",
    "due to the additional uncertainties of the stellar evolution models used to infer them , we did not include stellar ages , masses , or radii directly ( although those values are well - correlated with @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) . as alluded to above",

    "the first eigenvector from the principle component analysis , accounting for 40%   of the variance in the data , is dominated by a positive trend relating @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the trend indicates that the more massive disks in this sample are larger and orbiting more luminous - perhaps younger - stars that are accreting disk material at higher rates .",

    "although there is substantial overlap in the @xmath29 distributions from both surveys ( particularly when the disks with large central cavities are ignored ) , the differences can be attributed to the distinct approaches for interpreting the data and there is no obvious means of reconciliation at present .",
    "focusing on our results , we infer that the mass in @xmath21myr - old disks has a similar radial distribution regardless of the wide range of total masses ( @xmath53 - 0.1m@xmath6 ) probed in this sample .",
    "this implies that whatever mechanism is responsible for generating the viscosity in these disks insures that it has a roughly linear dependence on radius ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "since the physical origin of that viscosity is unclear , we adopt a simple prescription @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the sound speed and the viscosity coefficient @xmath45 describes the efficiency of the angular momentum transport @xcite . using the density structures and measurements of mass accretion rates @xmath57 ( see table [ viscous_table ] for references ) , we can estimate the value of the viscosity coefficient @xmath58 ( see the appendix in paper i for details ) .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath45 at @xmath59au is shown in figure [ vischist ] , with values for individual disks listed in table [ viscous_table ] .",
    "note that for the typical midplane temperature distribution @xmath60 , the viscosity coefficient is proportional to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "the model parameters and temperature distributions inferred for this sample have @xmath63 , meaning @xmath45 does not vary by more than a factor of @xmath22 - 4 across the disk .",
    "the inferred distribution of these viscosity coefficients appears bimodal , with peaks just below @xmath64 and above 0.01 .",
    "however , given the small sample , those peaks are not statistically significant ; they simply represent the clustering of the accretion rates in this sample .",
    "the range of inferred @xmath45 values is in reasonable quantitative agreement with magnetohydrodynamics simulations where the viscosity is generated by turbulence from the magnetorotational instability in slightly ionized disks @xcite .",
    "however , we should caution that these @xmath45 values are not yet well constrained : they suffer the combined uncertainties in the accretion rates and disk structure parameters , as well as from systematic issues with the inherent assumptions in their derivation ( e.g. , the dust traces the gas , viscous heating is insignificant , etc . ) .",
    "they represent only a first exploration of an improved empirical understanding of disk viscosities .    the interactions of gravitational and viscous torques control the evolution of disk structure over the vast majority of the disk lifetime .",
    "this viscous evolution process has two important , observable effects on that structure .",
    "first , the coupling of the viscosity and the keplerian orbital shear drives a net mass flow toward small radii , where material can be magnetically channeled onto the central star . that mass flow produces bright h emission lines , and the shock generated when it impacts the stellar surface gives rise to a strong ultraviolet continuum",
    "; both tracers can be used to estimate @xmath57 @xcite . to compensate for the angular momentum dissipated in that process , the material in the outer disk ( beyond some radius @xmath65 ; see table [ viscous_table ] and paper i ) is spread to larger radii .",
    "the results of that viscous diffusion - decreased average densities ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) and increased sizes ( @xmath26 ) - can be probed with resolved observations of the millimeter continuum emission . in principle , tracking these observational signatures as a function of time could provide strong constraints on the viscous evolution process .",
    "@xcite claim a significant correlation between their parameterization of @xmath26 and stellar age in a sample of taurus disks .",
    "no such correlation is evident in our larger sample of ophiuchus disks .",
    "more importantly , the search for such a trend within a single star - forming region is probably premature ; the ages of individual young stars can not be determined with sufficient accuracy to infer such evolutionary behavior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , even though it may exist .",
    "rather , the inferred disk structures could be considered representative of the diversity of evolutionary states and/or initial conditions at a  snapshot \" in the evolution sequence corresponding to some median cluster age ( in this case , @xmath21myr ) .    while there may not be much difference in the shapes of the @xmath36 profiles ( @xmath29 ) ,",
    "this sample includes disks with a wide variety of masses ( @xmath27 ) and characteristic size scales ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "as was demonstrated in figure [ median_vis ] , the disks with brighter millimeter emission have systematically larger masses _ and sizes_. this relationship is illustrated more directly in figure [ m_r ] , with a significant correlation ( 3.3@xmath43 ; spearman rank coefficient of 0.85 ) between @xmath26 and @xmath27 that can be approximated as a power - law , @xmath66 .",
    "the physical origin of the correlation is not clear .",
    "one potential explanation is that it reflects the range of initial conditions and viscous properties inherited at the disk formation epoch . in that case , note that the sense of the correlation is almost perpendicular to the evolutionary paths for individual disks that conserve angular momentum , @xmath67 . the spread along the correlation is then representative of the distribution of angular momenta imparted by the collapse of the parent molecular cloud cores .",
    "following @xcite , we can estimate the specific angular momenta in these cores that are needed to reproduce the inferred disk structures . assuming the centrifugal radius in the disk corresponds to the radius that contained @xmath290%  of the disk mass at the formation epoch ( here defined as approximately twice an initial scaling radius , @xmath22@xmath68 ) , then the specific angular momentum can be written @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the core radius ( see * ? ? ?",
    "precise values for the initial scaling radius are uncertain ( see below ) , but we can estimate upper limits on the @xmath71 values since @xmath72 by definition ( see paper i ) . substituting @xmath73 , @xmath74pc , and the stellar masses in table [ stars_table ] into eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we find @xmath75 - 20.9 in units of @xmath76s@xmath19 .",
    "radio observations of rotating molecular cloud cores have been used to infer similar or higher values , @xmath77 - 22.2 @xcite .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations have demonstrated that those measurements tend to overestimate @xmath71 by roughly an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "if that is the case , then the range of disk angular momenta inferred here are actually in good quantitative agreement with those determined for analogs of their parental molecular cloud cores .",
    "the low end of the @xmath71 distribution postulated by @xcite and not probed here could then be explained by a selection effect ( perhaps our flux - limited sample only recovers disks with large @xmath71 values ) , an unspecified mechanism for angular momentum loss ( e.g. , outflows or magnetic braking ) , and/or that @xmath78 in at least some cases .",
    "unfortunately , an unambiguous explanation of the _ shape _ of the @xmath27-@xmath26 correlation in this scenario is not possible , due to the fundamental degeneracy between the initial disk structures and the rates at which they evolve .",
    "the values of @xmath27 and @xmath26 change with time such that @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath68 were the initial disk mass and characteristic radius , respectively , and @xmath82 is a dimensionless parameter that tracks how many viscous timescales ( @xmath83 ) have elapsed , @xmath84 ( see paper i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that evolution is described by 2 equations with 3 unknown parameters , \\{@xmath81 , @xmath68 , @xmath83 } : the evolution rate can not be uniquely disentangled from the initial conditions",
    "however , the lack of significant outliers to the correlation may be related to the viscous evolution process itself .",
    "the  small and massive \" region in the upper left of figure [ m_r ] is depopulated because these disks spend only a short time with such compact density configurations early in their evolution ( @xmath85myr ) .",
    "likewise , the  large and low - mass \" region to the lower right in this parameter - space is empty because these @xmath21myr - old disks simply have not had enough time to evolve into it .",
    "alternatively , the inferred @xmath27-@xmath26 correlation could be the result of coupling the viscous evolution scenario described above with an internal dissipation process .",
    "recent theoretical calculations have suggested that the high - energy ( particularly far - ultraviolet , or fuv ) irradiation of the disk surface by the central star can drive significant mass loss from large disk radii ( @xmath86au ) in a photoevaporative flow @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the smaller , low - mass disks in this sample should be associated with an advanced stage in this photoevaporation process , perhaps because their central stars have more intense fuv radiation fields .",
    "unfortunately , direct constraints on the fuv emission from these extincted sources in the ophiuchus clouds are rare . instead , we can approximate the fuv luminosity as the sum of a fraction of the accretion luminosity ( @xmath87 ) and a chromospheric component ( @xmath88 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we find no evidence for an expected anti - correlation between disk masses / sizes and the fuv ( or x - ray ) luminosities in this sample : if anything , the larger and more massive disks tend to have more intense fuv radiation fields , whereas the less massive , smaller disks show a wide range of fuv luminosities . while this certainly does not exclude a role for",
    "photoevaporation in shaping disk structures , it does suggest that diverse initial conditions and viscous timescales are more significant contributors to the observed @xmath27-@xmath26 correlation at an age of @xmath21myr .",
    "comparisons of disk properties in different stellar populations will be required to definitively assess the relative impacts that initial conditions , viscous evolution , and dissipation effects like photoevaporation have on shaping disk density distributions over time .",
    "the key to disentangling the initial conditions from the viscous evolution timescale is to search for and characterize structural correlations , like the @xmath27-@xmath26 relationship found here , in disks around stars with a range of ages . in a scenario where viscous evolution dominates , the disks embedded in the envelopes of class 0/i sources should be massive and compact , providing direct constraints on the distributions of initial masses ( @xmath81 ) and sizes ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "conversely , the disks in older star - forming regions are expected to be larger and less massive , unless or until fuv photoevaporation can effectively dissipate the mass reservoir in the outer disk . tracking",
    "the evolution of disk masses and sizes in these older stellar populations can provide crucial insights into the distribution of viscous timescales , as well as into the timeframe where photoevaporation may dissipate much of the disk mass reservoir . to probe disk structures in these older star clusters",
    "that are typically at larger distances , instruments with increased sensitivity to millimeter continuum emission and access to higher angular resolution will be required .",
    "fortunately , there is great promise for a breakthrough in our understanding of viscous evolution and disk dissipation in the near future , based on extensive millimeter continuum surveys of disk populations with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "ultimately , the drive to understand this viscous evolution process lies in the desire to constrain how mass is re - distributed over time , and therefore where and when the conditions in a given disk are suitable for planet formation .",
    "all planet formation models require that the disk exceeds some density threshold as a necessary ( but perhaps not sufficient ) condition for making a planet . in light of the new constraints on disk densities presented here and in paper i , it is natural to compare them with the two basic recipes for giant planet formation ; disk instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and core accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the disk instability model , an over - dense region with a sufficiently short cooling time can fragment out of the global disk structure and precipitate a bound gaseous protoplanet very rapidly ( @xmath210@xmath89yr ; see the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "typically those conditions are only met at large disk radii @xcite ; such protoplanets must then migrate inward to reproduce the shorter period orbits observed in the solar system and elsewhere . in the core accretion model , a giant planet",
    "is produced from a relatively slow ( @xmath21 - 10myr ) collisional growth process that first builds up a large solid core and then rapidly accretes a massive gaseous envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming the dust traces 1%  of the gas mass , the disk structures presented here are stable against gravitational fragmentation , with the minimum local toomre @xmath90 values ranging from @xmath25 - 50 in most cases ( @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the keplerian orbital velocity ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the large , massive disks around",
    "doar 25 and gss 39 are potentially exceptions , with @xmath90 values approaching 2 at radii of @xmath265 and 150au , respectively .",
    "however , we should caution that the disk structures in both cases are particularly uncertain ( see  4.2 of paper i ) . while none of the sample disks are clear candidates for the efficient operation of the disk instability mechanism for planet formation in the current epoch ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) , their structures may have been less stable at earlier times . even without invoking some kind of mass loading mechanism @xcite",
    ", viscous evolution implies that these disks originally had denser , more compact structures , which might suggest a formerly lower minimum @xmath90-value and/or radius where the disk is least stable to fragmentation .",
    "a quantitative exploration of the history of @xmath94 in these disks grounded in our constraints on their viscous properties may well be worthwhile , but would require new radiative transfer calculations that incorporate some model for the thermal evolution of the disk material in each case .",
    "a similar comparison with the core accretion model is more challenging , primarily because resolution limitations do not yet permit a direct observation of the disk material inside @xmath9au .",
    "typically , core accretion model calculations impose a scaled minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) density structure for an initial disk , where @xmath95 @xcite and a total mass set to produce a formation efficiency commensurate with the observational constraints on disk lifetimes .",
    "although the mmsn surface density profile is too steep compared to those derived here ( where @xmath96 at the relevant radii ) , figure [ sigma ] demonstrates that the surface densities for the sample are generally compatible with those expected in the 20 - 40au region of the primordial solar disk .",
    "the shape of the @xmath36 profile should not adversely affect the likelihood of planet formation if sufficient mass is available , but it is expected to have an impact on the orbital architecture and migration properties of any resulting planetary system @xcite .",
    "some core accretion simulations have started to employ viscous disk density structures similar to those derived here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they still must populate that density structure with solid bodies orders of magnitude larger than those responsible for the observed millimeter emission .",
    "this last point highlights an important uncertainty in deriving densities from observations of young circumstellar disks : the conversion of emission to mass does not account for particles much larger than the observing wavelength .",
    "since this potential for substantially under - estimating the disk densities was already elaborated in paper i , we will not dwell on it here .",
    "the problem is not likely to be severe in the regions that can currently be probed observationally ( @xmath97au ) , as even optimistic estimates of particle growth timescales at those radii do not predict a substantial population of large solids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , at smaller disk radii those growth timescales can be considerably shorter , generating a dust emissivity that varies with radius inside the planet formation zone .",
    "more generally , it is worthwhile to emphasize that the observations are not yet sensitive to the midplane material for @xmath98au . inside that resolution",
    "limit , the densities could be dramatically different than inferred here if , for example , the dust size distribution is changed or the effective viscosity profile is modified ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . new data from alma and the expanded very large array ( evla ) will help alleviate these uncertainties at small radii , and should also help empirically guide our understanding of disk viscosities .    but despite our general ignorance of the inner disk structures , a subset of young disks show unambiguous evidence for evolution in the planet formation zone . in this sma survey of 17 disks ,",

    "<S> we present new results from a significant extension of our previous high angular resolution ( 03 @xmath0 40au ) submillimeter array survey of the 340ghz ( 880@xmath1 m ) thermal continuum emission from dusty circumstellar disks in the @xmath21myr - old ophiuchus star - forming region . </S>",
    "<S> an expanded sample is constructed to probe disk structures that emit significantly lower millimeter luminosities ( hence dust masses ) , down to the median value for t tauri stars . using a monte carlo radiative transfer code , the millimeter visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution for each disk </S>",
    "<S> are simultaneously reproduced with a two - dimensional parametric model for a viscous accretion disk that has a surface density profile @xmath3}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find wide ranges of characteristic radii ( @xmath4 - 198au ) and disk masses ( @xmath5 - 0.143m@xmath6 ) , but a narrow distribution of surface density gradients ( @xmath7 - 1.1 ) that is consistent with a uniform value @xmath8 and independent of mass ( or millimeter luminosity ) . in this sample , </S>",
    "<S> we find a correlation between the disk luminosity / mass and characteristic radius , such that fainter disks are both smaller and less massive . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this relationship is an imprint of the initial conditions inherited by the disks at their formation epoch , compare their angular momenta with those of molecular cloud cores , and speculate on how future observations can help constrain the distribution of viscous evolution timescales . </S>",
    "<S> no other correlations between disk and star properties are found . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred disk structures are briefly compared with theoretical models for giant planet formation , although resolution limitations do not permit us to directly comment on material inside @xmath9au . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is some compelling evidence for the evolution of dust in the planet formation region : 4/17 disks in the sample show resolved regions of significantly reduced millimeter optical depths within @xmath220 - 40au of their central stars . </S>"
