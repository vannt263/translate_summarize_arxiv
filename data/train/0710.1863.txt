    "it has become increasingly apparent in recent years that star formation is not just confined to the optically - bright parts of galaxies .",
    "signposts of low - level star formation , such as hii regions and uv - bright clusters , have been discovered in the far outer regions of galactic disks , well beyond the classical r@xmath0 radius ( e.g. @xcite ) , and in the tidal hi filaments of some interacting systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of star formation in these unusual environments , characterised by low metallicity , low hi column density and low interstellar radiation field , provides important constraints on star formation in galaxies , as well as the necessary conditions for sustaining a multi - phase interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "much theoretical effort has been devoted to understanding the formation of a cold molecular phase in the ism , a prerequisite for star formation .",
    "thermal instabilities are generally believed to be the primary mechanism for converting cool atomic gas into cold molecular gas once a minimum pressure or local threshold surface density is exceeded ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "additional mechanisms for forming unstable cold clouds include shocks from spiral density waves and swing - amplifier and magneto - jeans instabiities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the threshold column densities predicted for molecular cloud formation are on average a few times smaller than those inferred for massive star formation in galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "direct detection of molecular clouds in extreme environments provides a means to test ideas about cloud formation and survival .",
    "carbon monoxide ( co ) is the most abundant heteronuclear molecule ( i.e. with permitted rotational transitions ) and is excited by collisions at densities typical of molecular clouds , making co the standard tracer of molecular gas .",
    "concerns have previously been raised ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as to whether the physical conditions in the outskirts of disks are sufficient to excite co to detectable temperatures and whether the metallicities in these regions are sufficient to form enough co for detection . with the discovery of co emission out to 1.5  r@xmath0 in the disk of ngc  4414 @xcite and in high column density tidal hi filaments in the m81 group @xcite ,",
    "these concerns have been proven somewhat unfounded .    in this letter , we present the results of a search for molecular gas in the far outer disk of the nearby spiral ngc  6946 . while the study of molecular gas in ngc  4414 focused on high column hi regions @xcite , we have chosen to search for co emission in the vicinity of outer disk star - forming regions .",
    "ngc  6946 was previously identified through h@xmath6 observations to exhibit very extended massive star formation , out to @xmath7r@xmath0 @xcite , and thus presents an excellent opportunity to attempt to measure and quantify molecular gas at extreme radii .",
    "we also report on the null detection of molecular gas at two positions in the far outer disk of another spiral with extended star formation , ngc  1058 .",
    "our search was conducted using the iram 30 m telescope at pico veleta , spain during july 7 - 13 1999 in very good summer weather .",
    "the @xmath8co j@xmath9 and j@xmath10 transitions at 115.271 and 230.538 ghz were observed simultaneously in two polarizations ( h and v ) with the newly installed `` ab '' sis receivers .",
    "the filter bank back end was configured into four units of 256 x 1mhz channels , one for each polarization and each frequency , yielding a 650 km s@xmath11 bandpass and a channel separation of @xmath12  km s@xmath11 in the co(10 ) transition , respectively 330 and 1.3  km s@xmath11 in the co(21 ) transition .",
    "typical system temperatures ( t@xmath13 ) for the observations of ngc  6946 and ngc  1058 were 250  k at 115 ghz and 400  k at 230 ghz .",
    "all spectra are presented on the main beam temperature scale assuming forward and main beam efficiencies of 0.9 and 0.73 at 115 ghz and 0.84 and 0.51 at 230ghz .",
    "single pointings were obtained on or near hii regions lying at radii in the range 0.71.6  r@xmath0 in ngc  6946 ( see figure  [ galaxy ] ) , and 1.01.9  r@xmath0 in ngc  1058 .",
    "the iram 30 m beam size is 21@xmath14 at 115 ghz and 11@xmath14 at 230 ghz , corresponding to 560 and 280 pc respectively at the distance of ngc  6946 ( 5.5  mpc , see @xcite ) and 1  kpc and 0.5  kpc at the distance of ngc  1058 ( 10  mpc , see @xcite ) . as can be seen in figure [ galaxy ] ,",
    "the co beam size was usually larger than the size of the target hii regions .",
    "after eliminating obviously bad spectra and interpolating over occasional bad channels , spectra were summed for each transition and position . despite observing in position - switching mode with a reference position",
    "typically @xmath15 r@xmath0 from the galaxy , only a zero - order baseline subtraction was required .",
    "the results of our co search are presented in table 1 . in ngc  6946 ,",
    "co is clearly detected at 7 out of 10 positions , ranging from 0.71.3  r@xmath0 , with a further tentative detection at 1.4r@xmath0 ( p3 ) . in ngc  1058",
    ", no detections were made .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows the co(1 - 0 ) ( and co(2 - 1 ) when detected ) spectra of the eight positions in ngc  6946 with molecular gas emission .",
    "co(21 ) emission is detected at most positions with co(10 ) emission which suggests that the gas is not highly subthermally excited , as it might be if it were extremely diffuse .",
    "hi spectra extracted at the same positions and with the same synthesized beam size are overlaid , taken from the 21 cm data cube of @xcite .",
    "the hi and co velocities show excellent agreement , with the maximum offset being less than 3 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the co line widths , as determined from gaussian fits , are in the range 830  km  s@xmath11 and are greater than those expected from individual giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , even at the outermost positions .",
    "this implies that an ensemble of clouds is observed within the 560 pc co(10 ) beam in each case , similar to the findings of @xcite for the outer disk of ngc  4414 .",
    "the spectra at the two outermost positions warrant further discussion .",
    "the systemic velocity of ngc 6946 is very close to the velocity of the hi and co in the milky way , thus making comparisons at some positions more difficult than they would be in higher velocity systems .",
    "the detection at p8 ( 1.3  r@xmath0 ) could be called into question since the emission line is separated by only a single velocity channel from the narrow galactic line at this position . if the line emission were galactic in origin then we would expect it to have a significant spatial extent on the sky and to be detected at positions p5 and p4 . for a gmc lying 500  pc along the line of sight ( i.e. 100 pc above the galactic plane ) , p5 and p4 correspond to linear distances of 0.12 and 0.16  pc from p8 .",
    "no co emission at the velocity detected at p8 is seen at these positions .",
    "2 shows that weak hi is detected at the local velocity ( @xmath16 km  s@xmath11 ) by the wsrt in all positions but there is likely some spatial filtering out of the local hi signal . at p8",
    "the hi is much stronger at the velocity of the co we attribute to ngc 6946 , further strengthening our argument that the p8 detection is real and that the line belongs to ngc 6946 .",
    "we thus consider p8 to be a genuine detection of co emission from ngc  6946 .",
    "the line emission at 150  km  s@xmath11 towards p3 ( 1.4  r@xmath0 ) is statistically significant ( @xmath17 ) but another `` line '' of similar strength is seen at 270  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the precise agreement between the co and hi line velocities at this position certainly supports the reality of the co feature but the presence of the other peak casts some doubt . as a result , we consider p3 as a probable but still tentative detection .",
    "figure  [ beams ] shows a view of the spiral arm segment containing positions p2 , p7 , and p9p12 in the h@xmath6 line and in 8@xmath18 m emission , usually attributed to pahs , with hi contours overlaid . the pah emission was observed as part of the sings project with spitzer .",
    "while the locations of the hi , h@xmath6 , and pah 8@xmath18 m emission are closely correlated , the intensities of the emission at different wavelengths _ do not _ correlate .",
    "while p11 and p2 have similar h@xmath6 intensities ( see also table  1 ) , the 8@xmath18 m and co emission is much weaker further out .",
    "the n(h@xmath19)/n(hi ) ratio also decreases , by more than an order of magnitude , from 0.7 to 1.4 r@xmath0 and is largely driven by a sharp decrease in the co intensity as one crosses r@xmath0 ( p12 to p7 ) .",
    "table  1 also lists the implied h@xmath19 column density at each position , derived using a `` standard '' conversion factor of @xmath20 h@xmath19 @xmath2 per k km s@xmath11 @xcite , and the molecular gas mass within the beam , including a correction for helium .",
    "the masses inferred are in the range @xmath21 m  @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite studied molecular clouds in the far outer disk of the milky way ( presumably beyond r@xmath0 assuming a standard rotation curve ) and found clouds of much lower mass , in the range @xmath22 m  @xmath4 . if such clouds also exist in the outskirts of ngc  6946 , they would individually lie well below our detection limit of @xmath23 m  @xmath4 .",
    "we have presented evidence for the existence of molecular gas in the far outskirts of ngc  6946 and noted a rather abrupt decrease in the molecular gas fraction , as well as the pah emission , as one crosses r@xmath0 along an individual spiral arm .",
    "an important question is whether this behavior could be explained by metallicity variations in the underlying gas disk .",
    "indeed there is strong evidence for a radially increasing @xmath24 value ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as much higher values in low - metallicity systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicity in the outer disk of ngc  6946 varies by a factor @xmath25 from log(o / h)@xmath26 to @xmath27 @xcite while the i@xmath28/n(hi ) ratio decreases by a factor of @xmath29 . focusing only on the positions which bridge r@xmath0 ( p12 to p2 ) , the metallicity remains essentially constant while the i@xmath28/n(hi ) ratio decreases by a factor of @xmath30 . in the absence of a very strong radiation field ,",
    "the @xmath24 factor should not vary more than linearly with metallicity and @xcite estimates that @xmath31^{2/3}$ ] from a study of molecular clouds in local group galaxies .",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect that the @xmath24 ratio might be a factor 2  3 higher in the most distant points than at p9 , where the `` standard '' value is probably appropriate .",
    "such a correction is not sufficient to explain the strong decrease in i@xmath28/n(hi ) at r@xmath0 and we conclude that there is a genuine drop in the molecular gas content at the edge of the optical disk as defined by r@xmath0 .",
    "although our pointings were selected to lie on or near outer disk hii regions , the h@xmath6 luminosity contained within each beam shows significant variation and corresponds to local star formation rates ( sfrs ) ranging from @xmath32 m@xmath33 yr@xmath11 , using the @xcite calibration ( sfr@xmath34l(h@xmath35 erg s@xmath11 ) .",
    "the h@xmath6 emission in some regions is predominantly diffuse ( e.g. p12 and p7 ) and may more reflect ionization by photons produced elsewhere rather than _ in situ _ star formation @xcite .",
    "the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , defined as sfr / m(h@xmath19 ) , ranges from @xmath36 gyr@xmath11 ; eliminating the two outlier points ( p12 and p2 ) , the range reduces to @xmath37 gyr@xmath11 .",
    "the mere presence of a luminous hii region does not guarantee the detection of molecular gas .",
    "position p1 in ngc  1058 is the second most luminous star - forming region targeted in our study , and is our second most sensitive integration , yet co was not detected there .",
    "intriguingly , there is a potential correlation between the detection of co(21 ) emission and the presence of a luminous hii region in that the three non - detections of co(21 ) are among the four lowest h@xmath6 fluxes .    with the exception of p4 , the hi column densities at our observed positions within ngc  6946 are quite high , close to or greater than @xmath38@xmath2 on the scale of several hundred parsecs",
    ". the hi column density may be an important factor in determining whether molecular gas will be detected but a high hi column is clearly not a sufficient condition ( see also * ? ? ? * )",
    ".    it may be purely coincidental that n(h@xmath19)/n(hi ) changes abruptly across r@xmath0 in ngc  6946 .",
    "while r@xmath0 provides a means to characterise the optical extents of galaxies , it is not expected to relate to any underlying physical properties . in ngc  6946 , neither the metallicity , the hi surface density nor the surface brightness of the stellar disk exhibit unusual features at this location .",
    "interestingly , the azimuthally - averaged areal star formation rate in ngc  6946 does show a sharp decline near the edge of the optical disk ( @xmath39  r@xmath0 ) , although widespread low - level star formation is observed much further out @xcite .",
    "the rough correspondence between the star formation and molecular profile breaks could provide support for threshold models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although the physics that drives this behavior is still open to debate . pressure based @xcite and column density based @xcite models are very difficult to distinguish once the hi surface density exceeds that of the stars .",
    "larger - scale mapping of the outer disk of ngc  6946 and sensitive observations of the outskirts of additional galaxies are required in order to more thoroughly understand the molecular content and distribution at large galactocentric radii .",
