    "the deap / clean collaboration has proposed to use liquid argon and liquid neon as scintillating targets in large scale detectors to observe both @xmath3-solar neutrinos and dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )  @xcite . in particular , the miniclean experiment is designed to do a dark matter search with first liquid argon and then liquid neon as both a systematic check on backgrounds and as a precursor to a multi - tonne scale detector  @xcite . because of the expected @xmath4-dependence of the cross section for wimp - nucleon scattering  @xcite , filling the same detector alternately with argon and neon will change the expected dark matter signal in a known way while maintaining an identical level of external backgrounds . here",
    ", we extend previous studies of the scintillation properties of liquid neon  @xcite .    like the other liquefied noble gases",
    ", liquid neon is relatively inexpensive , is easily purified of radioactive contaminants , scintillates brightly when exposed to ionizing radiation and is dense enough to self - shield , reducing the background level in the center of a larger volume of liquid .",
    "the key for dark matter detection is to be able to suppress the electronic recoils that make up most of the backgrounds from the nuclear recoils that would make up a wimp signal by use of some combination of self - shielding and discrimination . because @xmath5 scattering also produces electronic recoils , discrimination does not improve the performance of a neutrino detector . however , neon has no long - lived radioactive isotopes and is more readily purified of such contaminants as @xmath6ar and @xmath7kr  @xcite than the heavier noble gases , rendering it an ideal target for low - energy neutrinos .    when ionizing radiation interacts in liquid neon or any other liquefied noble gas , ultraviolet light is produced via scintillation .",
    "the incoming radiation collides with an electron or nucleus in the liquid and deposits energy . the resulting electronic or nuclear recoil then excites or ionizes other neon atoms .",
    "the excited atoms quickly combine with surrounding ground state atoms to form dimer states , ne@xmath8 .",
    "the ions also bond with ground state atoms to form ionized molecules , ne@xmath9 , which can in turn recombine with free electrons to also form the excited dimer states . finally , the dimer states decay emitting scintillation photons with wavelength 80 nm . because these photons have insufficient energy to excite neon atoms  @xcite",
    ", the liquid does not absorb its own scintillation light and large light yields can be attained from liquid noble gas detectors .    the metastable molecules are produced in both singlet and triplet states .",
    "the singlet state decays in nanoseconds , while the triplet state undergoes a forbidden spin flip before decaying , extending the triplet lifetime to 15  @xmath10s in neon  @xcite .",
    "because nuclear and electronic recoils produce different ratios of singlets to triplets , pulse timing can be used to identify the source of the initial excitation via pulse shape discrimination ( psd )  @xcite . as the psd depends directly on the scintillation timing ,",
    "we have attempted to re - measure the time constants of liquid neon scintillation in this work .",
    "we discovered two additional time components in the light signals produced by ionizing radiation , and we also found that both the intensity and lifetime of each component changes significantly with the temperature and pressure of the liquid , a new feature that is not observed in the heavier noble gases .",
    "a second property of scintillation in liquefied noble gases is that nuclear recoils produce less light than electronic recoils of the same energy .",
    "the ratio of signal yields at zero electric field for the two event classes is known as the nuclear recoil scintillation efficiency , or @xmath1 . the value of @xmath1 in combination with the discrimination efficiency sets the nuclear recoil energy analysis threshold of a liquefied noble gas dark matter detector . because in general @xmath11 , two energy scales may be employed , denoted `` kevee '' and `` kevr . ''",
    "the actual energy deposited by a nuclear recoil is expressed in units of kev recoil or kevr .",
    "most calibration sources used in liquid noble gas detectors are @xmath12 or @xmath13 sources that produce electronic recoils in the liquid .",
    "therefore , the energy calibration gleaned from these sources refers to the energy deposited by an electronic recoil , or kev electron equivalent ( kevee ) . in practice",
    ", we often have no direct energy calibration for nuclear recoils and so use electron equivalent energies .",
    "the conversion factor is @xmath1 . at zero electric field @xmath14",
    "= e [ \\mathrm{kevr } ] \\times \\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{eff}.\\ ] ]    psd has been studied in argon  @xcite and xenon  @xcite .",
    "our group performed a measurement of psd in neon as well , but nuclear recoils were observed at only one energy  @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath1 has been measured in argon  @xcite and xenon  @xcite , but at only one energy in neon . in this paper , we report measurements of scintillation light in liquid neon over a wide energy range .",
    "we measure psd from 50 to 300 kevr and @xmath1 from 30 to 370 kevr .",
    "we also present results on the time dependence of liquid neon scintillation light as a function of temperature .",
    "the apparatus used in these measurements is named microclean and has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . a schematic",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] .",
    "the detector has an active volume of 3.14 liters viewed by two 200-mm - diameter hamamatsu r5912 - 02mod photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , which are specifically designed for use in cryogenic liquids .",
    "the active volume is defined by a polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) cylinder 200  mm in diameter and 100  mm in height , with two 3-mm - thick fused - silica windows at top and bottom .",
    "all inner surfaces of the ptfe and windows are coated with @xmath15 mg/@xmath16 of tetraphenyl butadiene ( tpb )  @xcite , which shifts the wavelength of the ultraviolet light to approximately 440  nm .",
    "the tpb thickness on the ptfe cylinder was reduced by @xmath17 relative to that used in  @xcite to mitigate tpb absorption of the wavelength - shifted light . the microclean vessel is contained within a stainless steel vacuum dewar for thermal insulation purposes .",
    "the gas handling system is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : gashandle ] .",
    "ultra - high - purity neon flows through a nupure omni 1000  @xcite getter and an external charcoal trap at 77 k ( not shown ) before passing into a vacuum cryostat through a tube at the top .",
    "previous studies have shown that activated charcoal provides a very effective purifier of many impurities in neon , including radon  @xcite . once inside the vacuum cryostat , the gas flows into a copper liquefier cell attached to the second stage of a cryomech model pt805 cryorefrigerator before dripping into the microclean vessel .",
    "there is a circulation loop inside the vacuum dewar for continuous purification of the neon , again using activated charcoal as the purifier .",
    "liquid neon flows out of the bottom of the microclean vessel into a nearby plumbing volume containing a heater .",
    "the heater ( labeled `` circ . pump '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : gashandle ] ) acts as a pump by boiling the liquid ; the resulting pressure differential between the heater and the liquefier drives gas up a tube through a charcoal trap mounted inside the cryostat before reentering the top of the liquefier , where gravity pulls the liquid back into the main chamber .",
    "the `` @xmath18kr@xmath19 generator '' shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gashandle ] refers to the setup for introducing @xmath18kr@xmath19 into the liquid neon for calibration purposes as described in sec .",

    "the @xmath18kr@xmath19 generator is connected to the gas inlet line just outside the vacuum dewar .",
    "the incoming gas can be diverted through the trap on its way into the detector to introduce @xmath18kr@xmath19 atoms into the neon .",
    "the data acquisition ( daq ) system consists of a 250 mhz , 12-bit caen v1720 waveform digitizer ( wfd ) .",
    "the two pmt channels are recorded with a record length of 64  @xmath10s  to collect as much of the long - lived triplet light as possible , and a sample trace is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sampletrace ] .",
    "the pmt signals are passed through a lecroy model 612am dual - output amplifier , with one copy passed to the wfd and the other copy sent to triggering electronics .",
    "the trigger is set in several different configurations . in most cases ,",
    "a trigger is generated when each pmt signal crosses a threshold of 1/2 times the mean height of a single photoelectron within a 100 ns coincidence window .",
    "for some low energy runs when an external detector is used as a coincidence tag , the trigger is generated when the sum of the two pmt signals crosses a threshold of roughly 1/2 the size of a photoelectron in coincidence with a signal in the external tagging detector . in each 64  @xmath10s",
    "data record , approximately 8  @xmath10s  of presamples are collected to measure the baseline of each pulse .",
    "the data collected by the daq software are saved in a root - based file structure for analysis  @xcite .",
    "the data processing is similar to that described in  @xcite .",
    "the presamples are averaged to obtain a baseline and a baseline root - mean - square , and the baseline is subtracted from each trace .",
    "we integrate each trace from 50 ns before the trigger ( defined as the time at which the voltage first rises above @xmath20 of its maximum value ) to 44  @xmath10s  after the trigger to determine the total area of each pulse . in performing this integral ,",
    "we restrict the range of integration to 100 ns windows around locations where the trace voltage crosses a threshold of three times the baseline root - mean - square .",
    "this integration method is a hybrid of single photoelectron counting and pulse integration .",
    "we reject data for which the trigger times of the two pmts differ by greater than 20 ns .",
    "we define an asymmetry parameter , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the signal areas in the top and bottom pmts .",
    "we reject data for which the asymmetry parameter is farther than @xmath24 from the mean value as determined by fitting a gaussian function to the asymmetry data .    as the triplet component of liquid neon scintillation",
    "is spread out over tens of microseconds , there are many single photoelectron pulses well separated in time in the tails of events . to obtain a single photoelectron spectrum for each pmt , the last 30 @xmath10s  of each trace",
    "is evenly divided into 150 ns windows",
    ". if the voltage spread in the first and last 30 ns of each 150 ns window is less than three times the size of the baseline root - mean - square , the peak height and pulse area of the window are collected in a 2-d histogram ; this restriction prevents inclusion of partial single photoelectrons in the data set .",
    "a gaussian is fit to the 1-d histogram of the pulse areas to determine the mean single photoelectron size .    in previous tests of the r5912 - 02mod",
    ", it was found that the gain dropped substantially at 30 k  @xcite .",
    "for the data presented here , we observe a sharp drop in pmt gain upon cooling to liquid neon temperatures , followed by a slow decrease in gain over several weeks before finally reaching a plateau .",
    "the low resulting gain necessitates the application of higher voltages to the pmts and amplification from the lecroy 610am amplifier ; for most of the data presented here , the pmts are biased at 1750 v , the absolute gain of the pmts is @xmath25 , and the pmt signals are further amplified by a factor of 10 with the lecroy amplifier .",
    "a single photoelectron peak is resolved in the bottom pmt but not in the top pmt . to improve pmt performance , we use two high voltage lines to bias the pmts , with a separate high voltage running directly to the first dynode . by tuning the first dynode voltage relative to the total voltage",
    ", we can achieve some improvement in the single photoelectron spectra but not enough to recover a resolvable single photoelectron peak in the top pmt .",
    "we use several radioactive sources for calibration purposes : the @xmath18kr@xmath19 generator described in  @xcite , a 10-@xmath10ci @xmath26na source for 511-kev and 1275-kev gamma rays , and a d - d neutron generator producing a monoenergetic beam of 2.8-mev neutrons  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18kr@xmath19 generator produces metastable @xmath18kr@xmath19 nuclei that decay via two electromagnetic transitions with energy 32.1 kev and 9.4 kev .",
    "the second transitions has a half life of 154  ns , and given the long time scale of liquid neon scintillation , both transitions are observed together as a single waveform of total energy 41.5 kev .",
    "the @xmath26na source produces positrons that immediately annihilate into two 511-kev gamma rays with opposite momenta ; we tag the second gamma ray using a nai crystal placed back - to - back with our apparatus to improve the data quality from the @xmath26na source and reduce backgrounds .",
    "we reject data where the trigger times in the nai crystal and the liquid neon differ by more than 30 ns , and we also make a cut to select events within 2@xmath27 of the 511-kev peak of the nai crystal .",
    "we also use a tagging detector when investigating nuclear recoils with the neutron generator .",
    "we require a pmt viewing bc501a organic scintillator to record an event within 200 ns of an event in the liquid neon .",
    "the organic scintillator is contained in a cylinder with a diameter of 127 mm and a depth of 127 mm .",
    "we also make a psd cut in the organic scintillator and a cut on the time - of - flight ( tof ) between the event in the liquid neon and the tagging detector .",
    "these cuts will be discussed in more detail in sec .  [",

    "[ fig : nuc_scatt ] . by changing the scattering angle @xmath28",
    ", we can choose the energy of the nuclear recoils that scatter just once in the liquid , @xmath29 , using simple kinematics : @xmath30,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the incident neutron energy and @xmath32 is the atomic mass of the target .",
    "we measure the angle by running a string marked at both ends and at its midpoint from the generator around the dewar and back to the generator .",
    "we mark the location of the midpoint of the string on the dewar and then repeat the process for the organic scintillator .",
    "the ratio of the arc length between the two points on the dewar to the circumference ( 175.6 cm ) provides the angle , @xmath28 .",
    "the accuracy is limited by our knowledge of the midpoint of the string , and by repeated measurements we estimate the uncertainty on the arc length to be 6.4 mm , for an uncertainty on the angle of 1.3 degrees .",
    "we obtain an energy calibration by comparing @xmath26na data with a simulation of the detector performed with the reactor analysis tool ( rat )  @xcite . combining geant4 and root  @xcite in a single simulation package",
    ", the rat simulation of microclean contains a complete optical model of the inner detector and pmts and has been used previously in studies of liquid argon scintillation  @xcite . in general , there are two features in the @xmath26na data that can be used for calibration purposes : a 511-kev photoabsorption `` hump '' and the compton edge .",
    "the analysis begins by first obtaining a rough estimate for the signal yield from the 511 kev hump , without using the simulation .",
    "we tune the parameters of the simulation to achieve the estimated light yield before simulating the @xmath26na source including a flat background contribution to account for the events observed above 600 kev from accidental coincidence of background events in the argon and 511 kev gamma rays in the nai detector .",
    "we then re - fit the data to the simulated spectrum , and the scale factor between the integrated charge from both pmts to the energy scale of the simulation provides the energy calibration ; an example of this fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lysim ] .",
    "while the energy resolution is not an explicit parameter of the fit , we do smear the photon counts from the simulated spectrum with a gaussian kernel having a standard deviation of @xmath33 , as this smearing provides better agreement between simulation and data .",
    "this additional smearing suggests a source of noise in the real experiment that is not being accurately modeled in the simulation , and a likely source of this noise is the poor gain dispersion characteristics of the pmts .",
    "it could also be a property of the liquid neon .",
    "the simulation does not accurately model the data below about 200 kev , predicting about @xmath34 fewer counts than observed down to the low energies where thresholding effects begin ( about 40 kev for the run shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lysim ] ) .",
    "this data excess is seen for a variety of different gain and trigger threshold settings , and it is currently unexplained , although asymmetry effects between the pmts smearing out very low energy events is one possibility , as is an additional source of background in the detector . given the discrepancy between data and simulation and the fact that that the trigger and gain settings were varied throughout the course of the run , the energy calibration fit is performed between 200 and 550 kev .    there is some tension between the best fit at the compton edge and the 511 kev hump , and the average @xmath35ndf is 2.5 for all runs with the nominal fit range .",
    "if the fit is restricted to the range between 350 kev and 550 kev , the agreement is much better , with an average @xmath35ndf of 1.4 .",
    "we estimate the systematic uncertainty caused by this tension to be @xmath36 by fitting each feature independently and taking the difference in the resulting energy scale relative to the nominal fit as the uncertainty . performing the fit without the flat background contribution in the simulation changes the calibration by less than @xmath37 .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty in this calibration are the statistics of fitting the simulated and observed spectra , but this source of uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath37 .",
    "we cross check the energy calibration obtained from the @xmath26na source with both higher and lower energy references . for our lower energy reference , we use the @xmath18kr@xmath19 source described in the next section which is the primary reason we believe the energy calibration is accurate to within our uncertainties .",
    "for the high energy reference , we look at the compton edges of the 1.4 mev and 2.6 mev gamma rays produced in the decay of @xmath38k and @xmath39tl , as there are a number of these events in background data .",
    "figure  [ fig : bgcomp ] shows background data with the energy scale derived from the @xmath26na calibration compared to a simulation of 1.4 mev and 2.6 mev gamma rays using the rat simulation .",
    "as the purpose of this simulation is solely to cross - check the accuracy of the energy scale derived from the @xmath26na at higher energies , we do not attempt to simulate any other sources of background ( i.e. lower energy gamma rays in the detector materials , cosmic rays , or other backgrounds ) ; therefore , we do not expect the simulation to agree with the data below 1 mev .",
    "we find evidence for a slight non - linearity in either the energy response of the liquid neon or the pmts at these energies , as the background data do not agree with the simulation if we assume a linear response of the detector up to 2.6 mev .",
    "the fit is improved if the observed energy ( as calibrated by the @xmath26na source ) is actually representing the following function of the deposited energy in the simulation : @xmath40 it is likely that this dependence is caused by a non - linearity of the top pmt , as a comparison using just the signal in the bottom pmt requires no energy scaling to provide agreement .",
    "we also find that the data are best fit with an energy resolution of @xmath41 . between 1 mev and 2.7 mev",
    ", we find a @xmath35ndf for this fit of 1.27 .",
    "na source by comparing background data to simulations containing @xmath38k and @xmath39tl components .",
    "we clearly see the two compton edges of the 1.4 mev and 2.6 mev gammas produced by these sources .",
    "we do not attempt to simulate any other backgrounds , so the divergence of data and mc below 1000 kev is not surprising .",
    "there is evidence for a non - linearity in the energy scale at these high energies that is likely related to a the response of the top pmt , and we correct for this using eq .  [ eq : energy].,width=302 ]      previously , we reported on use of a @xmath18kr@xmath19 generator as a source of low energy electronic recoils in liquid argon and neon  @xcite .",
    "this kr generator became available at the end of the experiment described here to provide a second , independent energy calibration at 41.5 kev , with a clear peak appearing in the data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kr ] .",
    "when the energy calibration is derived from the @xmath26na spectrum as described above , the energy of the @xmath18kr@xmath19 peak agrees with 41.5 kev within statistical uncertainties , suggesting both that the energy calibration is accurate and that the response of the microclean detector is linear between 9.4 kev and 511 kev ( recall that the @xmath18kr@xmath19 atoms emit two electrons at 9.4 kev and 32.1 kev to provide the full energy peak ) .",
    "the resolution of our detector at 41.5 kev is @xmath42 ( @xmath27/e of the gaussian fit shown in fig .  [ fig : kr ] ) .",
    "the energy calibration described above uses the total signal from both pmts .",
    "given the absence of a well - defined mean single photoelectron in the top pmt , the absolute signal yield is estimated from the bottom pmt alone by matching the energy calibration to the integrated charge of the bottom pmt divided by the size of the single photoelectron of the bottom pmt .",
    "after ending the liquid neon run described in this report , we filled the detector with liquid argon without warming up to room temperature or opening the system ; at the higher temperatures of liquid argon , we were able to resolve the single photoelectron response of both pmts . from these measurements , we determined that the top tube observes @xmath43 more signal than the bottom tube  @xcite , due to some combination of photon collection efficiency and photocathode quantum efficiency .",
    "therefore , we extrapolate the total light yield in the liquid neon to include both tubes based on the observed pmt efficiencies . using this method",
    ", we determine a photoelectron yield of @xmath44 photoelectrons / kevee from the @xmath18kr@xmath19 data .",
    "the total uncertainty includes an estimate of the uncertainty in the relative efficiency of the two tubes introduced by changing the temperature from 85 k to 25 k , but it is dominated by the single photoelectron response of the bottom pmt .",
    "we next use the @xmath18kr@xmath19 data to validate the @xmath26na calibration method . neglecting the systematic uncertainties from the pmt photoelectron response and efficiency , as they apply equally to both methods for determining the light yield , the standard @xmath26na energy calibration taken at the same time as the @xmath18kr@xmath19 data returns a light yield of @xmath45 photoelectrons / kevee , in agreement with the @xmath18kr@xmath19 calibration .",
    "this agreement provides confidence that we can trust the @xmath26na calibration for the data taken before the the @xmath18kr@xmath19 source became available .    as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : detstab ] , the signal yield was not stable throughout the course of the run ; the largest signal yield observed in this study was @xmath46 photoelectrons / kevee , a factor of about 3.5 larger than we achieved in our previous measurement ( 0.9 photoelectrons / kevee  @xcite ) .",
    "we attribute the increase to immersing the pmts in the liquid instead of viewing through pressure windows , improved photocathode coverage , and a change in the thickness of the wavelength shifter .",

    "[ fig : circulation ] , providing evidence that impurities were being contained by the charcoal .",
    "because we could not purge the internal charcoal trap while running the experiment , it is not clear whether all the impurities in the neon were removed or whether the trap became saturated .",

    "we disengaged the circulation pump for the remainder of the run , potentially allowing contaminants to build up in the neon and decreasing the observed light yield in the @xmath18kr@xmath19 data taken at the very end of the experiment to the @xmath44 photoelectrons / kevee reported above .    to account for the temperature effects ,",
    "the psd and @xmath1 data were collected at three different temperatures , 26.7 k , 27.8 k and 28.7 k , where each data set was taken over a roughly two week period .",

    "we therefore conclude that the detector signal yield was stable to better than 3@xmath50 for each temperature setting .",
    "we define the prompt fraction @xmath51 as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the voltage trace from the pmt , @xmath54 ns is an integration period determined to optimize the psd  @xcite , @xmath55 ns , @xmath56 @xmath10s , and @xmath57 is the trigger time .",

    "the probable cause for such a large amount of noise is the poor gain characteristics of the pmts and the use of an additional amplifier physically far away from the pmt itself , in addition to the factor of four longer integration period required for liquid neon scintillation . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : psdmodel ] shows the statistical model prediction in the ideal case where the additional noise is set to zero .",
    "we note that the effect of the additional noise is most relevant for energies above 100 kevr .        to test the hypothesis that the poor pmt response negatively affected the psd results , the signals in each pmt were analyzed separately . as expected given the single photoelectron distributions , the bottom pmt provided as much as an order of magnitude better psd compared to the top pmt above 150 kevr , dropping to a factor of about 2 at lower energies , although the combination of the two pmts still provides an improvement over just the bottom pmt alone .",
    "to achieve better overall psd , more effort will be needed to improve the response of the pmts at liquid neon temperatures ; as the two pmts exhibited different behaviors when cold , all pmts intended for use in a liquid neon detector may need to be cryogenically tested .",
    "another potential area of improvement would be a more sophisticated discrimination statistic . given the complicated nature of scintillation in liquid neon ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : temp ] ) , a psd analysis using more of the timing information along the lines of the multi - bin method described in  @xcite might prove rewarding .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is well known that nuclear recoils produce less scintillation light in liquid noble gases than electronic recoils do .",
    "there are several processes related to the linear energy transfer ( let ) of the incoming radiation that are known to contribute to the lower scintillation efficiency of nuclear recoils .",
    "the first of these is the lindhard effect  @xcite , where some of the energy deposited goes into heat instead of the creation of molecules .",
    "the lindhard effect has been shown to be sufficient to explain quenching in germanium  @xcite , but it is inadequate to explain @xmath1 for the noble gases .",
    "a second mechanism is known as bi - excitonic or hitachi quenching  @xcite , whereby @xmath66 when such a reaction occurs , the potential for creating two photons from the two original exciton states has been reduced to one photon via recombination of the single resulting ion .",
    "this reaction is more likely to occur in high density tracks like those produced by nuclear recoils .",
    "recently , a model has been proposed to phenomenologically tie this quenching to the stopping power  @xcite .",
    "lastly , some fraction of ionized electrons never recombine ; if these `` escape electrons '' are more likely for nuclear recoils than electronic recoils , this process would contribute to a smaller @xmath1 .",
    "this effect has been observed to lower @xmath1 in liquid xenon  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup for measuring the nuclear recoil scintillation efficiency has been described in  @xcite in the context of a measurement in liquid argon .",
    "one salient difference between the current analysis and the argon analysis is the absence of mc simulations of the neutron scattering .",
    "there are few experimental data on neon - neutron scattering , with geant4 switching discretely from data to a model for neutrons of energy @xmath67 mev .",
    "there are efforts underway to improve this situation for future studies  @xcite .    instead of fitting mc spectra to the data to determine the scintillation efficiency ,",
    "a simple gaussian function is fit to the data to determine the mean of the observed peak in units of kevee . given the non - gaussian nature of the single photoelectron distribution , we expect some skewing of the observed spectra towards high energies . in a simple mc of a similar situation in a larger detector ,",
    "the contribution of this skew is @xmath68 for the lowest energy point , below the level of our dominant uncertainties .",
    "hence , our scientific judgment is that the uncertainty introduced by this skew does not contribute significantly to our final uncertainty estimate .",
    "the final expression for @xmath1 is the observed mean of the signal yield divided by the expected energy of the recoil as predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : neutronscattering ] .",
    "data were taken at nine different scattering angles corresponding to energies ranging from @xmath69 kevr to @xmath70 kevr .",
    "each point , with the exception of the point at 178 kevr , was taken at the three different operating temperatures .",
    "the results at each temperature are consistent with each other to within the uncertainties of the measurement , so for the final determination of @xmath1 , all the data from each temperature are combined into one data set .",
    "figure  [ fig : peaks ] shows the final gaussian fits at each energy , and figure  [ fig : neonleff ] shows the observed nuclear recoil scintillation efficiency , along with the result from the previous measurement at 387 kevr  @xcite . to obtain @xmath1",
    "we assume that the signal yield from electronic recoils scales linearly with energy ( consistent with our observations between 40 kevee and 511 kevee ) and compare to the corresponding signal yield at each nuclear recoil energy .",
    "the mean value of @xmath1 thus obtained is 0.24 .",
    "because we expect there to be some contamination from multiple - scattering and gamma backgrounds into the distribution , as observed in argon data  @xcite , we limit the fit range in the region of the peak in the distribution ; the fit range is iteratively chosen to encompass plus and minus one sigma from the central value representing our estimate of the mean energy of the peak . the uncertainty associated with this choice of fit range",

    "one data selection cut requires that the two pmts trigger within 40 ns of each other and that the asymmetry parameter is within one sigma of the mean asymmetry value for the run . to select neutron - like events ,",
    "a psd cut was applied to the organic scintillator data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscpsd ] .",
    "we also apply a tof cut between an event in the neon and the tagging event in the organic scintillator .",

    "for all runs , neutron events formed a clear peak in the tof spectrum .",
    "as single - scattering neutrons are more likely to be found at the very beginning of the tof peak , the tof cut was located at the front side of the peak .",
    "first , the total number of counts in the neutron peak was found , and then the tof distribution was scanned until the number of counts in a 4-ns - wide bin exceeded @xmath36 of the total integral of the neutron peak ; this point set the left boundary of the tof window .",

    "these results provide confidence that the standard tof cut at the front side of the tof peak is selecting single - scattering events and eliminating multiple - scattering backgrounds .",

    "the size of the coincidence window between the trigger times of the two pmts was narrowed to 20 ns , and the cut was dropped entirely to study its effect .",
    "both the individual trigger cuts and the asymmetry cut were expanded to encompass the region within two sigma of the mean for the entire run . the range in pulse area of the organic scintillator psd cut was first narrowed and then scanned across the entire distribution of nuclear recoils ( the lower band in fig .",

    "the uncertainty associated with the tof cut , the width of the tof window was both narrowed to 6 ns and expanded to 16 ns , without changing the location ; as already discussed , moving the tof cut window away from the front of the tof peak eliminated any observable peak , so the location of the cut was not included as a systematic uncertainty .",

    "impurities in liquid noble gases can shorten the apparent triplet lifetime via absorption or non - radiative collisions .",
    "however , in the data of table  [ table : neonparameters ] , the shorter lifetime observed at higher temperature and pressure is not accompanied by a decrease in @xmath91 ; in fact , the contribution of the triplet component greatly increases with decreasing @xmath86 , contrary to what one would expect if decreasing @xmath86 was caused by impurities .    one possible mechanism that could explain the changing triplet lifetime without an accompanying reduction in @xmath91 is the presence of molecular bubble states analogous to those found in liquid helium",
    "; one could easily imagine that the radiative lifetime of the molecule changes depending on whether it resides within a bubble or not . if ne@xmath8 molecules are weakly bound in bubbles at these temperatures , then some fraction of molecules could be localized in bubbles with an additional fraction freely existing in the liquid , leading to the following model for the decay rate of triplet molecules , @xmath112 : @xmath113\\frac{<n_t>}{\\tau_{\\bar{b}}}.\\ ] ] here",
    ", @xmath114 is a function of temperature and pressure representing the fraction of molecules contained in bubbles , @xmath115 is the lifetime of molecules in bubbles and @xmath116 is the lifetime of molecules outside of bubbles .",
    "although such a model could account for the observed behavior , it is purely speculative given our lack of theoretical guidance for whether neon molecules truly do form stable bubbles .",
    "there are two intermediate components , one with a lifetime of order @xmath117 ns and the other with a lifetime of order @xmath118s .",
    "we can again draw a parallel to the situation in liquid helium and attribute some of this component to collisions between triplet molecules seeding the creation of singlet molecules that immediately decay as in the king and voltz theory . however",
    ", the kv theory can not entirely account for the intermediate exponential behavior , even if one modifies the kv model to include the decay of the triplet state .",
    "therefore , we attribute the longer - lived intermediate exponential component to either excited atomic states producing singlet molecules that immediately decay or to the decay of the long - lived atomic states themselves . in the first case ,",
    "the observed lifetime @xmath94 is equivalent to the reaction rate of excited atomic states with ground - state ne atoms ; if this collision rate increases with temperature or pressure ( perhaps because of increasing diffusion or bubble fluctuations ) , the observed lifetime would decrease . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath94 would be some combination of the true radiative lifetime of the atomic excitation and a quenching reaction .",
    "in contrast to the very long - lived exponential channel , the decreasing @xmath94 _ is _ accompanied by a decreasing @xmath100 , suggesting the existence of a non - radiative channel . taking the argument one step further , if we combine the two scenarios with the modification that three - body collisions of excited atomic states create _ triplet _ molecules , the non - radiative channel could result in the production of triplet molecules and the observed increase in @xmath91 .",
    "this interpretation could be consistent with the disappearance of a triplet atomic spectrum over several microseconds as observed by suemoto and kanzaki  @xcite .    in the future , understanding the effects of an applied electric field on liquid neon scintillation",
    "might illuminate some of the temperature / pressure dependencies observed in this work .",
    "a second study that would be useful in assessing whether molecules reside in bubble states would be further laser spectroscopy ; in liquid helium , molecular bubbles were first discovered in the absence of wavelength shifts for rovibrational structure in emission spectra of he@xmath8 between gaseous and liquid helium .",
    "these studies could be accompanied by theoretical work on the potential existence of molecular bubbles in liquid neon .",
    "third , the experimental conditions of microclean required that the liquid follow the saturation line , rendering it impossible to separate the temperature effects from those associated with pressure .",
    "it is likely that bubble interactions depend on the pressure more strongly than on the liquid temperature , and an experiment capable of probing the liquid phase space away from the saturation line and at higher temperatures could prove interesting .",
    "in this paper , we have reported measurements of scintillation light . with pmts immersed directly in liquid neon ,",
    "we have observed a substantial signal yield of up to ( @xmath119 ) photoelectrons / kevee . the observed signal yield is greater than what would be required for a @xmath3-neutrino measurement in clean and much larger than the signal yield assumed in previous simulations of a tonne - scale clean detector  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated the use of activated charcoal as a purifier to remove light reducing impurities in the liquid .",
    "we have quantified the performance of the prompt ratio psd method for liquid neon by measuring the erc for a nuclear recoil acceptance probability of approximately 0.5 between 50 kevr and 300 kevr , although we believe our measurement to be an upper limit on the discrimination power achievable with liquid neon due to noise in our system . as in previous studies of liquid argon",
    ", we observe a convergence of the @xmath51 parameter at low energies .",
    "we have also made a measurement of @xmath1 in liquid neon . finally , we have observed a very interesting time dependence of the scintillation of liquid neon , consisting of four distinct components and a clear temperature / pressure dependence in both intensity and timing .",
