    "collision - induced energy transfer involving h@xmath0 molecules plays an important role in many areas of astrophysics since hydrogen is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , dominating the mass of both dense and translucent molecular clouds . because h@xmath0 is a homonuclear molecule and lacks a dipole moment , its infrared emission is weak and it is difficult to observe directly . furthermore , because of the low mass of the hydrogen atom , the rotational levels of molecular hydrogen are widely spaced and require relatively high temperatures , @xmath5 100 k , to excite even the lowest levels appreciably via thermal collisions . nevertheless , with the current sensitivity of detectors deployed on space - based observatories , such as the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ and the former _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ , the detection and mapping of the pure rotational lines of h@xmath0 in a significant sample of galaxies is now possible @xcite .",
    "these observations , as well as others from the ultraviolet @xcite to the near infrared @xcite probe shock - induced heating and cooling and uv and x - ray irradiation of gas in the ism of galactic and extragalactic sources and star - forming regions .",
    "being the simplest diatom - diatom collision system and one in which all constituents are quantum mechanically indistinguishable , early work , notably by green and coworkers , carried out a succession of theoretical studies on rotational relaxation in h@xmath0+h@xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the relaxation cross sections involve the quantum mechanical scattering of the heavy particles on a potential energy surface ( pes ) which is computed using quantum chemistry techniques , accounting for the electronic motion for all relevant nuclear configurations of the constituent colliders .",
    "the availability of more realistic ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 potential surfaces has enabled considerable progress in obtaining a more reliable set of state - to - state collisional cross sections and rate coefficients . to date , the most comprehensive study has been made by @xcite and @xcite . within the rigid - rotor approximation , flower & roueff",
    "have made use of the ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 interaction potential of @xcite in a quantal coupled - channel method to determine the rate coefficients for rotational transitions in h@xmath0 + h@xmath0 collisions .",
    "rotational levels _ j _ @xmath6 8 and kinetic temperatures @xmath7 1000 k were employed and the results were compared with those reported by danby , flower , & monteiro ( 1987 ) based on an older potential surface .",
    "accurate determinations of rate coefficients for state - to - state transitions in small molecular systems such as the h@xmath0 molecule require a quantum mechanical description of the scattering process .",
    "a full quantum calculation of rovibrational transitions in the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 system is computationally challenging .",
    "so far , only a few studies have been reported that include both rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "pogrebnya and clary ( 2002 ) reported vibrational relaxation of h@xmath0 in collisions with h@xmath0 using a coupled - states approximation implemented within a time - independent quantum mechanical approach .",
    "panda et al . ( 2007 ) and otto et al . ( 2008 ) employed a time - dependent quantum mechanical approach and reported rotational transition cross sections in ortho - h@xmath0+para - h@xmath0 and para - h@xmath0 collisions .",
    "more recently , quemener et al . (",
    "2008 ) reported a full - dimensional quantum scattering calculation of rotational and vibrational transitions in the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 system that does not involve any dynamics approximation .",
    "all these calculations adopted the six - dimensional h@xmath8 pes developed by boothroyd et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . while this pes is useful for benchmarking full - dimensional quantum scattering codes for the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 system , comparisons with experimental data have shown @xcite that the pes predicts rotational transition rate coefficients between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 levels that are too small and that it is not appropriate for accurate determination of rotational transition rate constants in the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 system .",
    "since full - dimensional quantum calculations of four - atom systems are computationally demanding , especially for excited rotational levels , the rigid - rotor approximation is often employed .",
    "the adequacy of the rigid - rotor approximation for pure rotational transitions in h@xmath0-h@xmath0 collisions was recently demonstrated by otto et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who reported cross sections for rotational excitations in para - h@xmath0 using the rigid - rotor model and a full - dimensional quantum calculation .",
    "while these calculations have been performed using the bmkp pes , we believe that the conclusions are valid for the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 system in general .",
    "the accuracy of collisional data for astrophysical applications is limited by the uncertainty in the pes and the approximations employed in the dynamics calculations .",
    "it is a non - trivial task to judge the impact of the uncertainties in the collisional data , associated with the choice of the pes .",
    "accurate determination of the potential energy in the interaction region to the requisite level of accuracy of @xmath11 10@xmath12 hartrees ( or @xmath1110  k ) remains a challenge , as mentioned above .",
    "this is especially important at low temperatures where small uncertainties in the interaction potential translate into larger errors in the cross sections and rate constants .",
    "a further difficulty arises from fitting a limited number of ab initio potential energy points to obtain a surface over all configurations which are sampled in the scattering calculations .",
    "unphysical behavior in the fitted pes can result , particularly when bridging explicitly calculated energies at intermediate internuclear separations to long - range asymptotic forms .",
    "recently , a new and improved ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 rigid - rotor pes was computed by @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of this pes for rotational transitions in h@xmath0 has recently been demonstrated by comparing computed rate coefficients for @xmath13 rotational excitation against experimental results @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe that the new pes by diep & johnson ( 2000 ) could be employed to provide reliable values of rate constants for rotational transitions in the h@xmath0+h@xmath0 system . since the h@xmath0+h@xmath0 collision system is of astrophysical significance , it is crucial to establish whether the cross sections and rate coefficients for rotational energy transfer based on this pes are in agreement with the earlier data .",
    "therefore , we adopted this pes in the present quantum mechanical close - coupling calculations to obtain the rotational transition cross sections with initial levels @xmath1 8 for collision energies ranging from 10@xmath2 to 2.5 ev .",
    "the corresponding rate coefficients were computed for the temperature range of 2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath3 10,000  k. the present rate coefficients are compared with the results of @xcite and @xcite , which are to the best of our knowledge , the only comprehensive calculations available for rotational de - excitation rate coefficients .",
    "we also present h@xmath0-h@xmath0 cooling functions in the low - density limit and test the new rate coefficients in simulations of uv irradiated molecular gas .",
    "atomic units are used throughout unless otherwise specified , i.e. , distances are in bohrs ( a@xmath14 ) and energy in hartrees ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "recall that 1 a@xmath14 = 0.529177  , while 1 @xmath15 = 27.2114 ev = 219474.635156 @xmath16 = 627.51 kcal / mole .",
    "we carried out quantal coupled - channel calculations for collisions of h@xmath0 with h@xmath0 using a fixed bond length of 1.449 a@xmath14 ( 0.7668  ) .",
    "the rigid - rotor h@xmath0 target and projectile energy levels were calculated using a rotational constant of _ b _ = 60.853 @xmath16 . to solve the coupled - channel equations",
    ", we used the hybrid modified log - derivative airy propagator ( alexander & manolopoulos 1987 ) in the general purpose non - reactive scattering code molscat developed by @xcite .",
    "the log - derivative matrix is propagated to large intermolecular separations where the numerical results are matched to the known asymptotic solutions to extract the physical scattering matrix .",
    "this procedure is carried out for each partial wave .",
    "we have checked that the total integral cross sections are converged with respect to the number of partial waves , as well as the asymptotic matching radius ( e.g. , @xmath17 40 a@xmath14 ) for all channels included in the calculations .",
    "in addition to the partial wave convergence , we have checked that the results are optimized with respect to other parameters that enter into the scattering calculations .",
    "in particular , the parameters used for the analytical expression for the diep & johnson pes , @xmath18 where @xmath19 are radial expansion coefficients and @xmath20(@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) are bispherical harmonics .",
    "the angles @xmath21 , @xmath22 denote the two in - plane angles and @xmath23 is the relative torsional angle .",
    "we used 10 quadrature points each for integration along angular coordinates @xmath24 , and @xmath23 . from the diep & johnson",
    "fit to their numerical pes , the expansion coefficients @xmath19 are determined .",
    "they noted that only the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 terms make significant contribution to the potential .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we show a comparison between the pes adopted by flower & roueff , the @xcite potential , and the diep & johnson ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 pes for linear [ @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23]=[0 , 0 , 0 ] and parallel [ @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23]=[@xmath30/2,@xmath30/2,0 ] configurations , respectively . although the two potentials show close agreement for both configurations , the analytic pes of @xcite for ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 is known to be accurate only for pairs of hydrogen molecules with intermolecular separations not greater than @xmath31 a@xmath14 .",
    "the small discrepancy may be attributed to the improved accuracy in the diep & johnson pes which incorporates the correct long - range behavior .",
    "the present calculations consider the hydrogen molecules to be indistinguishable .",
    "symmetric basis sets were used for para - para and ortho - ortho collisions , whereas , for para - ortho collisions , asymmetric basis sets were chosen based on the order of the energy spectrum .",
    "the scattering cross sections for rotational transitions were computed for collision energies ranging between 10@xmath2 and 2.5 ev .",
    "four de - excitation cases with @xmath32 were considered ( i.e. , para - para and para - ortho ; ortho - para and ortho - ortho ) .",
    "note that a sufficiently large , but truncated basis set has been used to optimize the computation time and minimize the loss of numerical accuracy ( i.e. , to @xmath33 ) in the scattering cross section calculations .",
    "further details about the calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "rate coefficients for state - to - state rotational transitions were obtained by averaging the appropriate cross sections over a boltzmann distribution of the relative kinetic energy @xmath34 of the h@xmath0 molecules at a given temperature @xmath4 @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the boltzmann constant , and we have adopted the definition of the cross section for indistinguishable particles as given by @xcite . this definition differs from that adopted by flower & roueff which was given by @xcite . as discussed by @xcite , for single rotational excitation transitions",
    ", the cross section defined by @xcite must be divided by two if @xmath39 or @xmath40 to prevent double counting in the determination of the production rate of @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "the factor @xmath43 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) accounts for it .",
    "fig .  1 shows a comparison between the present theoretical results and the experimental rate coefficients of @xcite for the ( 0,0)@xmath44(2,0 ) excitation transition between 50 and 300  k , where we have used the notation ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the experimental and current theoretical rate coefficients are in good agreement as was shown previously in lee et al .",
    "the theoretical results obtained by @xcite , which used the older pes of schwenke , also shows good agreement with the measured and new calculated rate coefficients .    figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show the rotational de - excitation rate coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath47 for para - para and ortho - ortho collisions , respectively . for the para - para case ,",
    "the current rate coefficients for most transitions are found to be similar to those obtained by @xcite and @xcite , but for the important ( 2,0)@xmath44(0,0 ) transition , flower & roueff s result is @xmath1110% smaller for temperatures less than 1000  k colliders .",
    "we supplement these in figs . 2 and 3 , and in the discussion throughout , with additional data given between 1500 and 6000  k on david flower s website at ccp7.dur.ac.uk/cooling_by_h2/node1.html .",
    "] . on the other hand , ( 8,0)@xmath44(6,0 ) transition rate coefficients from @xcite and @xcite",
    "are larger compared to the current results and the agreement appears to deteriorate as the temperature increases above @xmath11400  k. the ( 4,0)@xmath44(2,0 ) transition , however , is in excellent agreement , but only below @xmath111000  k. likewise , for the ortho - ortho transitions , the rate coefficients of flower & roueff are similar to the current results , except at the highest temperatures",
    ".    figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) show the rotational de - excitation rate coefficients for para - ortho collisions .",
    "reasonable agreement was observed , except for the ( 8,1)@xmath44(6,1 ) , where the results of flower & roueff tend to be significantly larger than the present calculations .",
    "this behavior is essentially identical to that seen for the ( 8,0)@xmath44(6,0 ) transition shown in fig .",
    "discrepancies are also noted for all of the transitions at the highest temperatures .",
    "numerical values for the rate coefficients are given in table 2 .",

    "rate coefficients for endothermic transitions can be obtained by detailed balance which is implemented in the fortran routine .    because the accuracy of the pess for values of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( see eq .",
    "1 ) is uncertain , we did not explicitly compute the rate coefficients for @xmath59 transitions , except for two @xmath60 cases : ( 4,0)@xmath44(0,0 ) and ( 5,1)@xmath44(1,1 ) .",
    "the rate coefficients for these processes are typically a factor of @xmath1150 smaller than the @xmath46 rate coefficients , for the same initial state .",
    "transitions with @xmath61 are expected to have even smaller rate coefficients .",
    "while these two rate coefficients have been fitted , we estimate all other @xmath62 transitions with a version of the modified exponential energy gap law ( megl ) @xcite . with the megl ,",
    "the rate coefficients for @xmath59 transitions are obtained by scaling the @xmath63 rate coefficients with the following relation @xmath64 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath65/k_b$ ] is the difference in rotational binding energies in k and @xmath66 is usually adopted .",
    "we find that the ( 4,0)@xmath44(0,0 ) transition is fit with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the latter being nearly temperature independent .",
    "in order to investigate the effect of the new rate coefficients in astrophysical environments , we show in figure 4 low - density - limit cooling functions given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the cooling rate in erg cm@xmath12 s@xmath72 , @xmath73 is the number density of h@xmath0 in rotational state @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the emitted photon energy .",
    "here we consider transitions among the lowest four rotational states and plot the cooling rate due to para - h@xmath0 collisions on h@xmath0(@xmath76 ) and the total cooling rate for a statistical distribution of ortho- and para - h@xmath0 , i.e. ortho : para=3:1 , following the prescription given by @xcite .",
    "the new cooling functions are compared to those obtained by @xcite , based on the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 rate coefficients of flower & roueff , which are indicated to be valid between @xmath77  k. the two sets of cooling functions are generally in agreement to within @xmath1120% for @xmath78  k including cooling due to ortho - h@xmath0 collisions ( not shown ) .",
    "the level of agreement reflects differences in the collisional rate coefficients shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "however , above @xmath112000  k the cooling functions of @xcite are seen to depart significantly from the current results which is due to the divergence in the two sets of rate coefficients at the higher temperatures .    in a further test",
    ", we include the full set of h@xmath0-h@xmath0 rate coefficients in a model of a molecular photodissociation region using the spectral simulation code cloudy @xcite .",
    "model v3 of the pdr - code comparison study @xcite is adopted where the total density is taken to be 10@xmath79 cm@xmath12 and the intensity of the incident far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation field is 10 times the standard @xcite fuv field .",
    "other model parameters of the molecular region are given in @xcite .",
    "a nearly complete description of the electronic , vibrational , and rotational radiative and collisional properties of the h@xmath0 molecule was included as described by @xcite .",
    "figure 5a gives the h and h@xmath0 number densities and the temperature structure of the cloud as a function of depth .    in figure 5b ,",
    "the effect of the new h@xmath0-h@xmath0 rate coefficients are shown by plotting the ratio of the rotational populations @xmath80 determined from two separate models . in the numerator ,",
    "the standard set of h@xmath0-h@xmath0 rate coefficient fits given in @xcite are adopted , while in the denominator the current h@xmath0-h@xmath0 rate coefficients are used .",
    "h@xmath0-h and h@xmath0-he collisions are also included and taken from the recent calculations of @xcite and @xcite and used in both models .",
    "since the rate coefficients from the two calculations are in general agreement , most levels do not experience a significant change in population .",
    "however , differences are seen for cloud depths greater than @xmath81 cm which corresponds to an increase in the total h@xmath0 abundance and decreases in the h abundance and gas temperature .",
    "the abundance changes maximize the effect of h@xmath0 colliders reducing the importance of h collisions , though he collisions are still important . as such , while the discrepancies in the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 rate coefficients are maximum above @xmath111000  k , their effects at these high temperatures will be masked by the more important roles of h and he collisions .",
    "however , as the temperature decreases below 100  k and h@xmath0 collisions become more important , the discrepancies are related to the fact that the @xcite fits were not intended to be valid below 100  k. the largest differences are for the @xmath82 and @xmath83 populations , @xmath1150% and @xmath1120% , respectively .",
    "these differences are related to the increase in the rate coefficients to populate the levels as shown in figs .",
    "3a and 2a , respectively , for temperatures less than 200  k. as the temperature falls further , below @xmath1120  k , discrepancies in the @xmath10 and @xmath84 populations also become significant due to the fact that the current rate coefficients reach a minimum near this temperature , while the fits of @xcite go to constant values .",
    "we have performed an extensive quantum mechanical coupled - channel calculation , based on a recent and presumably more reliable ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 potential energy surface , to obtain rotational transition cross sections with initial levels @xmath1 8 .",
    "collision energies ranging between 10@xmath2 and 2.5 ev were considered .",
    "we have computed the corresponding rate coefficients for the temperature range from 2 to 10,000  k and have compared our results with the previous work of @xcite and @xcite , which were based on an older potential energy surface .",
    "we conclude that in some cases , the improvement made in the new potential energy surface and larger number of basis functions used in the present scattering calculations led to significant changes in the resulting state - to - state cross sections and rate coefficients .",
    "implementation of the new h@xmath0-h@xmath0 rate coefficients in calculations of the low - density - limit cooling function and in the rotational level populations in a molecular photodissociation region result in some differences compared to the use of the rate coefficients from flower & roueff .",
