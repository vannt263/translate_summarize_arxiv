    "the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) ser  x-1 has been known as an x - ray source from the early days of x - ray astronomy .",
    "it was discovered in 1965 ( friedman , byrom & chubb 1967 ) . its optical counterpart has proven more elusive , however . when an accurate ( 1arcmin ) position for the x - ray source became known ( doxsey 1975 ) , davidsen ( 1975 ) suggested that the optical counterpart was an ultraviolet excess object with @xmath2 .",
    "subsequently thorstensen , charles & bowyer ( 1980 ) used images obtained in better seeing conditions to show that this counterpart was actually two coincident stars ( dn and ds ) separated by 2.1arcsec .",
    "the southern one , designated mm  ser , was by far the brighter in the ultraviolet .",
    "the detection of an optical burst from ds , simultaneously with an x - ray burst ( hackwell et al.1979 ) , confirmed that the x - ray source was associated with ds .",
    "more recently , however , wachter ( 1997 ) has shown that ds is itself two unresolved stars ( dse and dsw ) , separated by only 1arcsec .",
    "wachter suggested that the brighter of the two stars , which is bluer , might be the true optical counterpart .",
    "silber ( 1998 ) has analysed rapid photometry which supports this , indicating that the brighter of the two stars is significantly variable .",
    "no convincing periodicity was found in these data , however .",
    "spectroscopy of mm  ser  was obtained at several epochs , before it was resolved into two stars .",
    "thorstensen et al .",
    "( 1980 ) obtained blue spectroscopy of both ds and dn .",
    "both showed h@xmath3  absorption , but ds in addition had a heii  4686  emission line .",
    "cowley , hutchings & crampton ( 1988 ) confirmed the presence of narrow heii  emission .",
    "their spectrum shows no h@xmath3  absorption , but possible niii4640  emission .",
    "shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported an almost featureless continuum spanning the full optical bandpass , albeit at a very low resolution which would be insensitive to weak emission features .",
    "an absorption feature around 5900  was attributed to a g star secondary .",
    "we report on further spectroscopy of mm  ser .",
    "our primary goal was to separate the spectra of dse and dsw and hence confirm which is the true optical counterpart to ser  x-1 .",
    "since the most recent published spectroscopy dates from 1988 we also were able to obtain a higher quality spectrum using modern instrumentation and hence study the properties of mm  ser  in more detail than previously possible .",
    "spectra of mm  ser  were obtained from the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on la palma on the nights of 2001 july 8 and 10 using the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) with the isis dual - arm spectrograph .",
    "the seeing was typically 1.01.5arcsec on july 8 and @xmath4arcsec on july 10 .",
    "the slit width was set to 0.83arcsec .",
    "the slit was aligned to pass through the two blended stars ( dse and dsw ) identified by wachter ( 1997 ) .",
    "the blue arm was used with the eev12 ccd and the r600b grating to yield a resolution of 1.9 .",
    "note that the blue spectrum is heavily vignetted at either end ; the useful coverage spans 37205260 . on july 8",
    "the red arm was used with the tek4 ccd and the r600r grating for a resolution of 1.5 . on july 10",
    "the r316r grating was instead used giving a resolution of 3.1 .",
    "a log of the spectra obtained of mm  ser  is given in table  [ obstable ] .",

    "unfortunately no suitable red arm flat field was obtained on july 10 , so it was necessary to use the july 8 one which was obtained with a different grating .    initially",
    "a combined spectrum of both stars was extracted using the iraf implementation of optimal extraction ( horne 1986 ; marsh 1989 ) .",
    "as there are actually two blended stars at the site of mm  ser , this will not truly be an optimal extraction in this case .",
    "the spectra extracted in this way were still far superior to a non - optimal extraction , however .",
    "wavelength calibration was interpolated relative to exposures of a cune+cuar lamp and checked against night sky lines .",
    "the rms scatter among the latter was 0.25  in the blue and 0.14  in the red , with no systematic offset in either case .",
    "flux calibration was applied relative to the spectrophotometric standard bd+33@xmath52642 ( oke 1990 ) ; this was also used to correct for telluric absorption features . as an 0.8arcsec slit",
    "was used significant uncertainty will be introduced in the flux calibration due to slit losses , especially as the slit was not aligned at the parallactic angle due to the need to follow the line of centres of the blended star .",
    "consequently , the flux calibration of the spectra is only approximate .",
    "the average extracted spectra ( a composite of the two blended stars ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ avspecfig ] .",
    "the presence of _ strong _ emission lines in the combined spectrum suggests that the brighter , bluer star is the optical counterpart to mm  ser  as suggested by wachter ( 1997 ) . to confirm this we also used the spectral deblending method of hynes ( 2002 ) to extract spectra of the two stars separately .",
    "three further spectra were obtained with the fors2 spectrograph at the very large telescope ( vlt ) on 2002 may 18 .",
    "the 1400v grism was used with an mit / lincoln labs mosaic ccd and an 0.7arcsec slit .",
    "the seeing was around 1.2arcsec .",
    "further details are given in table  [ obstable ] .",
    "images were debiased and flatfielded using starlink ccdpack routines . as no suitable psf template was available , and",
    "the contribution of the fainter star appeared very small , we only performed a single object ` optimal ' extraction with iraf as above .",
    "the images were marred by a number of bright spots , typically up to 2030pixels across .",
    "these originate from enhanced dark current in regions that had been heavily saturated during earlier observations .",
    "we examined the saturated images to identify which regions of the spectrum might be affected .",
    "fortunately , there were only a few mildly saturated regions coincident with the location of our spectra , and none of these correspond to apparent features in the extracted one - dimensional spectra .",
    "we therefore believe that this problem does not compromise our dataset .",
    "wavelength calibration was applied with respect to an arc image taken during the day .",
    "the wavelength was checked with respect to sky lines ( mainly [ oi ] 5577 ) .",
    "there was an offset of @xmath6  ( 13kms@xmath1 at 4686 ) which was corrected .",
    "this is within the expected flexure for fors2 ( szeifert 2002 ) .",
    "given the large slit losses due to poor seeing , no flux calibration of this spectrum was attempted .",
    "the final average spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ vltspecfig ] .",
    "to separate the two stars we applied the deblending algorithm of hynes ( 2002 ) to the july 10 red wht spectra .",
    "these had the best spatial resolution and were well exposed , and were the only spectra suitable for this work .",
    "the stars were not fully resolved ( fig .",
    "[ spatialprofilefig ] ) , but were sufficiently separated that they could be identified and deblended .",
    "we defined the spatial profile with a base voigt function , with width allowed to vary with wavelength , together with a wavelength independent numerical correction .",
    "the deblended spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ deblendfig ] .",
    "it is clear that the emission features detected do originate from the bright star .",
    "h@xmath0  is particularly striking , but hei  6678is also recognisable .",
    "these features are clear in both individual spectra as well as in the average .",
    "this provides further confirmation of earlier suggestions ( wachter 1997 ; silber 1998 ) that the brighter of the two stars , dse in the terminology of wachter ( 1997 ) , is the lmxb .    comparing the two components , at the epoch",
    "observed the fainter star contributes only about 1520percent of the total light in the 6000 - 7000  band . for comparison ,",
    "the magnitudes given by wachter ( 1997 ) correspond to contributions of 19percent at @xmath7 and 25percent at @xmath8 .",
    "the only emission lines clearly detected in the wht blue spectrum are heii  4686  and the niii  bowen blend around 4640 ; there are no strong balmer emission lines in the blue .",
    "the bowen blend contains at most weak ciii  emission . moving to the red ,",
    "the wht spectrum is dominated by h@xmath0 , with hei  5875 and 6678  also present .",
    "the vlt spectrum partially overlaps the wht blue - side , but also fills in coverage around 5500 .",
    "it shows the same blue lines , of niii  and heii  4686 , with a similar relative strength .",
    "the heii  5411  line is also clearly present .",
    "weak h@xmath3  emission does appear to be present , on the blue - side of a broad absorption trough .",
    "this is a ubiquitous feature in both black hole and neutron star lmxb spectra , e.g.  buxton & vennes ( 2003 ) ; see also soria et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and references therein for other black hole examples and hynes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and casares et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for other neutron star cases .",
    "if it is indeed associated with h@xmath3 , the large redshift ( @xmath9kms@xmath1 ) remains unexplained .",
    "it is possible that the apparent redshift is only due to filling in of the blue absorption by emission , however .",
    "such absorption troughs are usually attributed to the inner optically thick accretion disc ( e.g.soria et al .",
    "2000 ) , but a large redshift would not then be expected .",
    "apparent features are seen at 4605 and 4945 .",
    "they do not appear to be artifacts , but there is no obvious identification and no strong features are seen in other lmxbs at these wavelengths . given the inferior quality of the wht spectra",
    ", they would probably be undetectable there .",

    "[ profilefig ] , where the line profiles in velocity space are collated .",
    "the fwhm listed in table  [ linetable ] are based on single gaussian fits to the unbinned spectra .",
    "the contribution from the instrumental resolution has been corrected for , but is never dominant . for comparison the fwhm of heii  in 4u1822371 ( casares et al .",
    "2003 ) is fwhm 750kms@xmath1 , and the lines in 4u1735444 and 4u1636536 respectively have fwhms of @xmath27kms@xmath1 and 1220kms@xmath1 ( casares et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "such narrow emission lines are thus rather atypical for an lmxb",
    ". if they are disc lines , then the narrowness could indicate either a long period , and hence a large disc with a low outer velocity , or a low inclination , or a combination of both . without fully resolving the profiles and confirming that they are disc lines , it is of limited value to model them . applying some simple models to the heii  4686  line",
    ", however , suggests that for typical neutron star lmxb parameters , if the period is less than 1day then @xmath28 .",
    "a longer period allows a somewhat higher inclination ; for 10days then @xmath29 . these are not very robust estimates , however , as when system parameters are known , apparent sub - keplerian velocities are often inferred from disc line profiles ( marsh 1998 ) .",
    "alternatively the lines may not be dominated by the disc ; they could come from the companion star or stream - impact point , or some other region ( as in xte  j2123058 ; hynes et al.2001 ) , in which case the narrowness would be more natural . in this case , unless the inclination were low , we would expect the lines to move .",
    "there is clearly no large velocity difference between the two epochs , and the heii  4686  velocities measured are consistent within errors , especially allowing for some uncertainty in the absolute velocities .",
    "the wht spectra are individually too poor to search for shorter timescale radial velocity variations .",
    "the three vlt spectra are better suited .",
    "they are equally spaced and the 5577  night sky line is stable to @xmath30  between them .",
    "we measure gaussian fit velocities for heii  4686  in the individual spectra of @xmath31kms@xmath1 , @xmath32kms@xmath1 , and @xmath33kms@xmath1 respectively .",
    "these suggest a small drift ( over about an hour ) , but this is not significant at the 90percent confidence level and more observations would be needed to confirm any motion .",
    "the region around the niii  lines and heii  4686  is expanded and compared in fig .",
    "[ bowenfig ] .",
    "the niii  blend appears to show repeating structure with a strong peak corresponding to the 4641/42  lines and a weaker peak for 4634 .",
    "there is no evidence for ciii  4647/50/51 emission .",
    "that these components are resolved suggests that the individual components are narrow , like the isolated lines .",
    "the ratio of the bowen and heii  equivalent widths is @xmath4 , typical of galactic plane lmxbs which have values of 0.51.0 ( motch & pakull 1989 ) .",
    "our spectra show a number of interstellar features ; nad  lines , diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) and perhaps cah and k lines .",
    "we can use these to constrain the amount of reddening toward mm  ser , although since these measures depend on measurements of equivalent widths , it is only valid to use measures from the deblended red spectrum .",
    "shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that the strong nadfeature in the spectrum of mm  ser  indicated a g - type companion star .",
    "since the spectrum shows strong diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) , we instead feel that it is more likely that the nad  absorption is also of interstellar origin .",
    "caii  h and k lines ( 3933,3968 ) are also marginally detected in the blue spectrum , which should be dominated by the accretion light ; hence these favour an interstellar origin .",
    "the interstellar absorption is therefore likely large .",
    "the nad  doublet can be used as a reddening indicator , but is only reliable for small reddenings ( @xmath34 ) , as it is prone to be saturated at larger values ( munari & zwitter 1997 ) .",
    "we measure an ew for the nad  5890  line of @xmath35  from the deblended spectrum of dse . this is larger than any values given by munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) , which saturate at a maximum value of about 1.2 .",
    "there is a spread in the saturation values , however , as it depends on the relative velocities of the clouds contributing to the absorption .",
    "a larger maximum nad  ew is seen when multiple resolved components are present as this partly circumvents saturation .",
    "since all of the stars considered by munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) are at @xmath36kpc and mm  ser  has an estimated distance of 8.4kpc ( christian & swank 1997 ) , it is likely that a larger ew is possible in the latter , since nad  absorption will be spread over a wider range of velocities and hence be less affected by saturation .",
    "we can still use the nadstrength as a lower limit for the reddening ( if it is of interstellar origin ) , since the asymptotic linear relation between ew and @xmath37 at low reddenings defines the limiting case of unsaturated absorption .",
    "the relation given by munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) will then define a lower limit of of @xmath38 .",
    "we note that the ratio of the lines is also an indicator of reddening ( munari & zwitter 1997 ) , since the nad  5896  line is intrinsically weaker and so saturates more slowly . at low optical depths",
    "the ratio is 2.0 , but this decreases to 1.1 as the reddening increases .",
    "we measure a ratio of @xmath39 suggesting that at least some components are saturated and hence that the reddening is high , significantly larger than the lower limit .",
    "a relatively high reddening is supported by the strong dibs ; from the dib at 6203  we measure an ew of @xmath40m , implying @xmath41 ( herbig 1975 ) .",
    "the dib at 6283  may also be strong , but will not be reliable due to telluric contamination .",
    "this value is consistent with the column density of @xmath42@xmath43 estimated by christian & swank ( 1997 ) , since the latter would imply @xmath44 ( e.g.  bohlin et al.1978 ; predehl & schmidtt 1995 ) .",
    "we conclude that mm  ser  is moderately reddened , with all indicators consistent with a reddening @xmath45 .",
    "we have performed spectroscopy of mm  ser , the optical counterpart to ser  x-1 .",
    "we resolve the two close components identified by wachter ( 1997 ) and confirm earlier suggestions that the brighter of the two is an emission line source and hence the true counterpart .",
    "the spectra reveal emission lines of hi , hei , heii , and niii , as well as interstellar features .",
    "the emission lines are unusually narrow .",
    "since all lines show similar widths , the most likely explanation seems that they are disc lines , but that the binary inclination is very low .",
    "alternatively they could also originate from a more localised region such as the companion star or stream - impact point , but we would then require that the disc not dominate any of the optical lines .",
    "further time - resolved observations would be needed to search for motion of the lines and discriminate between these possibilities .",
    "higher resolution spectroscopy would also be beneficial to resolve the narrow line profiles better and study the substructure of the niii  blend .",
    "based on the strong interstellar lines , we have estimated a reddening consistent with estimates based on the x - ray derived neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath44 .",
