    "we are accustomed in string and related theories to the apparent need for more than four space - time dimensions . on the other hand , the conjectured equivalence ( duality ) , between some ordinary four dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories and string theories on certain ten dimensional space - time manifolds @xcite ,",
    "suggests that these extra dimensions may be but a mathematical device that conveniently reflects some other aspect of the underlying theory .    in the late 1970 s",
    ", we showed how a single extra compact dimension effectively arises in the context of the fishnet diagram model of a string world - sheet in a scalar quantum field theory with an @xmath7 global symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that in field theories with a richer symmetry , for instance @xmath8 , multiple compact dimensions ( perhaps @xmath9 ) will arise from the same mechanism .    as an important preliminary to extending the work of @xcite to higher symmetries ,",
    "we give in this article a new derivation of the main results of @xcite that does nt rely on indirect arguments , such as invoking @xmath10 symmetry ( modular invariance ) and the universality of the continuum limit .",
    "instead , we obtain all the results by direct and explicit computation . the methods used here are fairly standard , borrowed from the mathematical analysis of one - dimensional heisenberg spin chains by yang and yang @xcite and from that of the 6-vertex models by lieb @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "however our particular model involves several novel details , e.g. a non - standard lattice , not present in those classic treatments , and we think our direct approach illuminates these features in a useful way .    the fishnet model @xcite as formulated in @xcite is obtained in the context of a discretized light - cone parameterization of the propagators of an @xmath11 matrix quantum field theory : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 running over all positive integers .",
    "planar diagrams are singled out by t hooft s @xmath16 limit .",
    "all propagators of the fishnet diagrams ( see fig .",
    "[ fishgen ] ) of @xcite are restricted to @xmath17 .    for a fixed total @xmath18 and fixed evolution time @xmath19",
    ", this restriction achieves the maximal density of vertices , and is plausibly appropriate for strong coupling . in @xcite and also here , the focus is on how to deal with internal degrees of freedom carried by the propagators of these fishnet diagrams .",
    "we simply accept the simplest fishnet _ ansatz _ as a working model for string formation . as discussed in @xcite",
    "there is a lot of room for improvements in the fishnet model itself , but we do nt consider those issues here .",
    "thus the sum of fishnet diagrams provides a model of the discretized world - sheet @xcite of light - cone string theory @xcite .",
    "the main piece of physics we draw from the model is that @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which determine the size and shape of the lattice world - sheet , are determined by the @xmath22 , carried by the system of field quanta propagated by the diagram , and by the time span over which that system evolves . in the continuum limit @xmath23 , so that energy ( @xmath24 ) eigenvalues @xmath25 can be read off from the exponential dependence on @xmath21 of the sum over diagrams @xmath26 .",
    "notice that the fishnet diagram determines a novel two dimensional square lattice in which all links are rotated by 45 degrees .",
    "we refer to such a lattice as a diamond lattice .",
    "one of the lacunae in @xcite was the reliance on known results for a conventional square lattice plus the reasonable assertion that the continuum limit should be isotropic .",
    "our calculation here deals directly with the diamond lattice configuration , and the details of the computation are therefore new . in particular we develop an appropriate adaptation of the bethe _ ansatz _ @xcite to the diamond lattice .",
    "the field theory analyzed in @xcite is the special case @xmath27 of a matrix scalar field @xmath28 transforming as a vector under @xmath6 with quartic interaction terms that respect this symmetry : @xmath29 for @xmath27 it is convenient to define a single non - hermitian matrix field @xmath30 which carries a unit @xmath31 charge .",
    "the interaction terms then become @xmath32 the charge carried by a given line in a diagram is indicated by attaching an arrow pointing in the direction of charge flow .",
    "there are precisely six ( planar ) charge conserving vertices ( see fig .  [ 6vertices ] ) :    two with weight @xmath33 in which each adjacent pair carries charge 0 into the vertex , and four with weight @xmath34 in which two adjacent lines carry charge 2 into the vertex .",
    "scaling @xmath35 just multiplies the diagram by an overall factor @xmath36 , so we lose nothing by scaling @xmath33 to 1 , so the weights of the two classes of vertices are @xmath37 respectively . a typical fishnet diagram with these vertices",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ 6vfishnet ] .",
    "the sum of all such diagrams is thus seen to be equivalent to calculating the partition function for a 6-vertex model on a diamond lattice .",
    "the fishnet diagram can be thought of as a discrete ( imaginary ) time evolution of a state which is a tensor product of @xmath20 two state systems , ( `` spins '' ) , labeled by up and down arrows . because of the diamond lattice configuration , the basic discrete evolution is two time steps , and we define each element of the @xmath38 transfer matrix @xmath39 as the product of vertex factors associated with the subgraph that connects a given row of arrows with the row two time steps above it .",
    "it is easy to see that the state with all arrows up or all arrows down is an eigenstate of the transfer matrix with eigenvalue @xmath40 .",
    "let us next consider the states with one overturned arrow , i.e. @xmath42 up arrows and 1 down arrow . with periodic boundary conditions , even and odd locations for this down arrow are not equivalent , because of the diamond lattice .",
    "denote the state with down arrow at location @xmath43 by @xmath44 . then , by following the change in @xmath43 after two time steps we find the action of the transfer matrix @xmath45 note , by the way , that the action of @xmath39 is local in that the down spin migrates at most two sites after two time steps .",
    "thus , in representing a spin wave as a fourier transform with respect to location , we must allow for a phase shift in the even terms with respect to the odd terms : @xmath46 applying the transfer matrix to the state @xmath47 and shifting the sums over @xmath43 appropriately , we find that @xmath48 is multiplied by the factor @xmath49 for @xmath50 . for @xmath47 to be an eigenstate of @xmath39 , these two factors must agree , which determines a quadratic equation for @xmath51 : @xmath52 it is easy to see that interchanging the two solutions for @xmath53 interchanges the eigenstate @xmath47 with @xmath54 .",
    "thus we lose no generality in selecting the solution @xmath55 provided we allow @xmath56 the full @xmath57 range , @xmath58 .",
    "( keeping both solutions would require restricting the range of @xmath56 to @xmath59 to avoid double counting . ) when the transfer matrix acts on arrows near @xmath60 , it wraps around with the location 1 equivalent to @xmath61 , @xmath20 equivalent to 0 , etc .",
    "these terms must match for @xmath47 to be an eigenstate , which requires @xmath62 or @xmath63 putting the selected solution for @xmath51 back into one of the factors ( [ factors ] ) , we find the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix to be @xmath64 where @xmath65 it is a welcome outcome that the eigenvalue is automatically positive as long as @xmath66 .      moving on to two overturned arrows",
    ", we employ the bethe _ ansatz _ for two overturned arrows appropriate to our diamond lattice : @xmath68 { |l , m\\rangle}e^{ilk_1+imk_2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hskip2in\\mbox{}+a(1,2)\\bigl(k_1,\\xi_1 \\leftrightarrow k_2,\\xi_2\\bigr)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath69 overturned arrows , the bethe _ ansatz _ is the obvious generalization , wherein the sum over @xmath70 is replaced by a sum over all permutations of the spins , and @xmath71 is generalized to an @xmath72 for each permutation .",
    "@xmath72 factors into a product of @xmath73 for each pair interchange needed to accomplish the permutation .",
    "when the bethe _ ansatz _ succeeds , as it does for this model , the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix is just @xmath74 by explicitly analyzing the case @xmath75 , we find after much tedious algebra that @xmath76 where we have defined @xmath77 .",
    "finally , the conditions that the periodic boundary conditions are consistent with the _ ansatz _ being an eigenstate are @xmath78 since the permutation factor @xmath72 for @xmath69 overturned arrows is built up from pair factors , the @xmath75 case is sufficient to determine all of the information we need to handle the general case , which leads to the boundary conditions @xmath79",
    "for analyzing these equations it is convenient @xcite to map the @xmath81 onto new variables @xmath82 for which @xmath83 depends only on the difference @xmath84 .",
    "this is accomplished by the map @xmath85 note that our parameter @xmath86 is related to a similar parameter @xmath87 in @xcite by @xmath88 , which we shall also occasionally use .",
    "this version of the map is appropriate for @xmath89 , for which @xmath90 is a pure phase .",
    "the case @xmath91 must be handled separately .",
    "some special values of @xmath92 delineate the map : @xmath93 corresponds to @xmath94 which implies @xmath95 , and @xmath96 map to @xmath97 .",
    "( we are choosing @xmath56 to be in the range @xmath98 . )",
    "thus the whole range @xmath99 corresponds to @xmath100 . note that @xmath101 shrinks the range of @xmath56 to 0 , whereas @xmath102 represents the maximum range .",
    "it is straightforward to work out the following quantities in terms of the new variables : @xmath103 } + { \\sin\\nu\\over2[\\cosh\\alpha-\\cos\\nu]}\\nonumber\\\\ t(k)&=&\\left(\\cos k+{1\\over",

    "different choices for these integers lead to different solutions for the set of @xmath56 s .",
    "yang and yang @xcite encounter similar equations in their analysis of the @xmath106 heisenberg spin chain , and their techniques for solving them in the limit @xmath107 can be directly applied . for easy comparison , we attempt as far as possible to adopt their notation .",
    "we begin by first choosing the set of numbers @xmath105 to be consecutive with no gaps : @xmath109 .",
    "we define a kernel @xmath110 and density function @xmath111 by @xmath112 and then convert the equation for the @xmath56 s as @xmath107 into an integral equation @xmath113 this equation has the same kernel @xmath110 as the one analyzed in @xcite , but a different inhomogeneous term @xmath114 .",
    "the values chosen for @xmath115 determine the characteristics of the eigenstate .",
    "for example , the eigenstate with maximum eigenvalue @xmath116 for the transfer matrix corresponds to @xmath117 .",
    "the values of @xmath56 at the limits of this range are @xmath97 and clearly @xmath118 for these values . as long as @xmath119 , @xmath120 for all finite @xmath92 , so taking the whole range of @xmath92 corresponds to including in the expression for @xmath116 all values for @xmath121 greater than unity . for the continuum limit",
    "we are only interested in very large @xmath115 since then the eigenvalues will be close ( within @xmath122 ) of the maximum eigenvalue .    as shown in @xcite , the kernel @xmath123 , can be used to rewrite the equation for @xmath124 , which determines it over the whole range of @xmath92 , in terms of its values outside the range @xmath125 .",

    "is much more complicated than the 6-vertex model : each line of the diagram can be in @xmath226 states , and there are many more distinct vertices .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath227 case there are 19 vertices that conserve the 3-component of spin",
    ". these models are currently under study .",
    "the fishnet model is at best relevant only to the strong coupling behavior of the underlying quantum field theory .",
    "even then we do not yet fully understand how fishnets fit in to the most well - established string / field duality , ads@xmath228s@xmath229/@xmath230  susy yang - mills . optimistically ,",
    "the mechanism illustrated in this paper will shed light on the field theoretic origin of the s@xmath229 part of the ten dimensional space - time manifold : the yang - mills super - multiplet contains 6 scalar fields that transform under the vector representation of @xmath231 .",
    "the conjecture of the previous paragraph suggests that fishnets propagating only these scalars would describe the @xmath231 nonlinear sigma model , leading to the emergence of @xmath232 .",
    "but in its simplest presentation , the dense fishnet model produces flat minkowski space - time for the remaining non - compact dimensions , not anti - de sitter space - time .",
    "we believe that this flaw is present because the dense fishnets completely freeze out both fluctuations in the number of field quanta _ and _ fluctuations in the distribution of @xmath22 along string . properly including the gauge fields in the fishnet approach",
    "could improve this situation by allowing some of these fluctuations even at strong coupling @xcite .",
    "indeed , since the @xmath8 nonlinear sigma model is not conformally invariant for @xmath233 , consistency of the string interpretation requires a nontrivial dynamical interplay between the s@xmath229 degrees of freedom and the space - time degrees of freedom in the world - sheet action .",
    "as presently understood , the ads / cft connection @xcite implements this via the ads metric and the 5-form ramond - ramond flux on @xmath232 .",
    "more concretely , the light - cone treatment of string on ads@xmath228s@xmath229 @xcite indicates how these interactions appear in the world - sheet action , in which the 5th dimension plays a role similar to the liouville field in restoring conformal invariance .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the graph summation approach can adequately account for these features ."
