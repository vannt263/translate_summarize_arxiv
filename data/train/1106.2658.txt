    "the atmospheric optical turbulence is an effect that acts on the propagation of light waves through the atmosphere .",
    "its origin is on random variations of the refractive index associated to temperature fluctuations .",
    "atmospheric optical turbulence drastically affects to astronomical observations , limiting the capabilities of ground - based telescopes .",
    "the refractive index structure parameter , c@xmath1 , constitutes a quantitative measure of the atmospheric optical turbulence strength @xcite[e.g . ] which depends on the position .",
    "c@xmath1 as a function of the altitude is commonly referred to as optical turbulence profile , being a relevant variable in the definition of adaptive optics systems in astronomy .",
    "the scintillation detection and ranging ( scidar ) technique is an efficient technique to measure the optical turbulence profiles in astronomical observatories .",
    "scidar is based on the analysis of the intensity distribution ( scintillation patterns ) at the pupil plane ( classical - scidar ) or at a virtual plane ( generalized - scidar ) of a telescope when observing a double - star .",
    "atmospheric turbulence profiles are derived through the inversion of the normalized autocovariance of a large number of scintillation patterns .",
    "the scidar technique , in its classical or generalized versions , has been extensively explained in previous papers @xcite .",
    "the classical - scidar @xcite is not sensitive to turbulence at the observatory level while generalized - scidar @xcite is able to measure this turbulence by locating the analysis plane in a virtual position a few kilometers below the pupil plane .",
    "generalized scidar has been extensively used in astronomical sites to study the atmospheric optical turbulence for applications in the development of adaptive optics systems and site characterization @xcite . from the early experimental implementations of the technique",
    ", it was noted that generalized - scidar data processing leads to an overestimation of the optical turbulence strength @xcite that was assumed as negligible at any altitude .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this overestimation might be negligible or relevant strongly depending on the selected observational parameters  namely telescope diameter , double - star angular separation and analysis plane conjugation altitude . an analytical expression to calculate the actual errors induced during generalized - scidar data processing as well as a procedure for the correct recalibration of c@xmath1 profiles derived from generalized - scidar observations were also provided in @xcite .",
    "this procedure has been already applied to re - calibrate atmospheric optical turbulence profiles retrieved in mt graham @xcite , el teide @xcite , and san pedro mrtir @xcite observatories .    the atmospheric optical turbulence monitoring programme at the roque de los muchachos observatory ( orm hereafter ) started in 2004 .",
    "the classical data processing @xcite[see e.g. ] was performed to retrieved the c@xmath1 profiles from the generalized - scidar observations assuming negligible errors induced in the data treatment .",
    "results derived from the c@xmath1 profiles in the orm database were already published @xcite before the @xcite work . in this paper , we present the database of atmospheric optical turbulence profiles recorded at the orm through generalized - scidar observations , the largest database of c@xmath1(h ) for an astronomical site that has been published so far .",
    "we also perform the recalibration of the c@xmath1 profiles in the orm database to compensate for the errors introduced during data processing .",
    "we analyze the implications in the statistical results derived from this database before and after the recalibration . section  2",
    "presents the database of c@xmath1 profiles derived from generalized - scidar measurements at the orm .",
    "we also calculate the impact of the data processing error on retrieved c@xmath1 profiles and re - calibrate the full database following the proposed procedure in @xcite .",

    "the orm is located at an altitude of @xmath2 meters above sea level ( _ asl _ hereafter ) , at latitude @xmath3 n and longitude @xmath4 w on the island of la palma ( canary islands , spain ) .",
    "this astronomical site was one of the final candidates to locate the european extremely large telescope ( 42m - eelt ) .",
    "a monitoring program of the atmospheric turbulence structure at the orm began in 2004 using the generalized - scidar technique .",
    "the 1-m jacobus kapteyn telescope was used in combination with the cute - scidar instrument @xcite developed at the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( tenerife , canary islands , spain ) .",
    "each detector pixel of cute - scidar instrument covers a square 1.935 cm in size on the 1-m jacobus kapteyn telescope pupil .",
    "the generalized - scidar data were processed using the traditional procedure @xcite[see e.g. ] of deriving the normalized autocovariance from a series of scintillation patterns ( 1000 images in orm case ) .",
    "the autocovariance peaks allow the determination of c@xmath1(h ) using a numerical inversion .",
    "the c@xmath1(h ) systematic campaigns at orm were carried out from february 2004 to october 2006 and from january 2008 to august 2009 with a frequency of about 4 - 6 nights per month .",
    "useful generalized - scidar observations were obtained in 211 nights during these campains and 197035 individual c@xmath1 profiles constitute the database of turbulence profiles at orm ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , the largest c@xmath1 database published until now .",

    "@xcite , the effect of the induced error during data processing consists of an overestimation of the turbulence strength , but following the actual turbulence structure .",
    "generalized scidar observations in high - resolution mode were obtained when the normalized autocovariance showed no evidence of high - altitude turbulence layers , but stratified turbulence at low level ( the selection of this mode was subject to observer criteria and experience ) .",
    "moreover , the use of high - resolution mode presents a seasonal bias according to fig .",
    "[ relfre ] . for these reasons , the median high - resolution turbulence profile ( fig .",

    "this difference is well - explained taking into account the seasonal variation of the turbulence structure already reported for the canary islands observatories @xcite .",
    "most of the high - vertical resolution profiles ( 53 % ) were recorded between june and august ( see fig . [",

    "the relative frequency of turbulence profiles recorded in low - vertical resolution mode ( fig .",

    "useful generalized scidar measurements were obtained during 211 nights .",
    "the total number of individual c@xmath1(h ) profiles recorded at this site is 197035 .",
    "the error induced during generalized scidar data processing has been calculated , being more significant when using high - vertical resolution mode ( @xmath10 500 meters ) .",
    "following the procedure proposed by @xcite , we have re - calibrated the full database of turbulence profiles recorded at orm , showing the effects of theses errors in the calculation of statistical atmospheric parameters relevant for adaptive optics . combining the corrected turbulence profiles ,",
    "we have obtained the statistical high- ( @xmath10 500 meters ) and low - vertical ( @xmath11 500 meters ) resolution turbulence profiles to have a view of the turbulence structure at orm .",
    "the main conclusions that we have derived from this work can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "the generalized scidar data processing leads to an overstimation of the optical turbulence strength that it is not negligible for most of the observational configurations used at roque de los muchachos observatory . *",
    "the error introduced during the processing of the generalized scidar data can drastically affect the statistical values derived for atmospheric parameters relevant for adaptive optics ( namely total seeing , boundary - layer , free - atmosphere contributions and isoplanatic angle ) , being as large as 50 per cent for high - altitude layers in some generalized scidar configurations used at orm . *",
    "both the high- and low - vertical resolution profiles obtained for orm show that most of the optical turbulence is concentrated in the first 5 km .",
    "the most intense turbulence layer is at the observatory level .",
    "a lower strength turbulence layer is detected in mid - altitude levels ( 4 @xmath9 h @xmath9 8 km ) .",
    "the c@xmath1(h ) set recorded at the roque de los muchachos observatory constitutes the largest database of optical atmospheric turbulence profiles so far .",
