    "the theorem on loop formulas due to lin and zhao @xcite has contributed to understanding the relationship between the stable model semantics and classical logic . unlike other translations that modify the vocabulary of a logic program @xcite , the original theorem on loop formulas characterizes the stable models of a nondisjunctive program in terms of the models of its completion that satisfy the loop formulas of all loops of the program .",
    "this allows us to compute stable models using sat solvers , which led to the design of answer set solvers assat @xcite and cmodels @xcite .",
    "due to its importance in semantic understanding as well as in stable model computation , the theorem on loop formulas has been extended to more general classes of logic programs , such as disjunctive programs @xcite , infinite programs and programs containing classical negation @xcite , and programs containing aggregates @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been applied to other nonmonotonic logics , such as circumscription @xcite and nonmonotonic causal logic @xcite .",
    "the stable model semantics for first - order formulas given in @xcite is also closely related to the idea of loop formulas , as described in @xcite .    by slightly modifying the definition of a loop",
    ", lee  @xcite showed that loop formulas can be viewed as a generalization of completion  @xcite .",
    "the model - theoretic account of loop formulas give in  @xcite also tells us that the idea of loop formulas is closely related to assumption sets  @xcite or unfounded sets  @xcite . in a sense ,",
    "the theorem by lin and zhao is an enhancement of the unfounded set based characterization of stable models given in  @xcite .",
    "the unfounded set based characterization takes into account the loop formulas of _ all sets of atoms _ , while the theorem by lin and zhao considers the loop formulas of _ loops _ only .",
    "gebser and schaub @xcite improved this enhancement even further .",
    "they defined the notion of an elementary loop of a nondisjunctive program and showed that the theorem by lin and zhao remains correct even if we consider loop formulas of _ elementary loops _ only .    in this article , we reformulate the definition of an elementary loop of a nondisjunctive program by gebser and schaub , extend it to disjunctive programs , and study several properties of elementary loops , including how maximal elementary loops are related to minimal unfounded sets .",
    "based on the notion of an elementary loop , we present the class of head - elementary - loop - free ( hef ) program , which strictly generalizes the class of head - cycle - free ( hcf ) programs due to ben - eliyahu and dechter @xcite . like an hcf program",
    ", an hef program can be turned into an equivalent nondisjunctive program in polynomial time by shifting head atoms into the body  a simple transformation defined in @xcite .",
    "this tells us that an hef program is an `` easy '' disjunctive program , which is merely a syntactic variant of a nondisjunctive program .",
    "we also observe that several other properties of nondisjunctive and hcf programs can be generalized to hef programs .",
    "the main results from  @xcite and @xcite , characterizing stable models in terms of _ inherent tightness _ and _ weak tightness _ , respectively , can be extended to hef programs , and likewise the operational characterization of stable models of hcf programs due to leone _",
    "@xcite can be extended to hef programs .",
    "the properties of elementary loops and hef programs studied here may be useful in improving the computation of disjunctive answer set solvers , such as claspd @xcite , cmodels @xcite , dlv @xcite , and gnt @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : elm - nondis ] , we present our reformulated definition of an elementary loop of a nondisjunctive program and provide a corresponding refinement of the theorem on loop formulas , as well as some properties of elementary loops .",
    "these results are extended to disjunctive programs in section  [ sec : elm - dis ] . in section  [ sec : hef ] , we introduce the class of hef programs and show that their shifted variants preserve stable models . in section  [ sec : tight ] , we generalize the notion of inherent tightness to hef programs .",
    "an operational characterization of stable models of hef programs is presented in section  [ sec : msv ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "this paper is an extended version of the conference papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "after providing the relevant background on nondisjunctive programs , this section introduces elementary loops of nondisjunctive programs .",
    "we further refine elementary loops to elementarily unfounded sets , yielding a syntactic characterization of minimal unfounded sets .",
    "moreover , we show that elementary loops of nondisjunctive programs can be recognized in polynomial time .",
    "( the statements of the theorems and the propositions in this section which apply to nondisjunctive programs will be generalized to disjunctive programs or hef programs in later sections and the proofs will be given there . ) finally , we compare our reformulation of elementary loops with the definition by gebser and schaub @xcite .      a _ nondisjunctive rule _ is an expression of the form a_1 a_2,  ,a_m ,  a_m+1 ,  ,  a_n where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are propositional atoms . a _ nondisjunctive program _",

    "second , the two definitions do not agree on trivial loops : a trivial loop is an elementary loop , but not a gs - elementary loop .",
    "this originates from the difference between the definition of a loop in  @xcite and its reformulation given in  @xcite . as shown in the main theorem from @xcite , identifying a trivial loop as a loop admits a simpler reformulation of the lin - zhao theorem by allowing us to view completion formulas  @xcite as a special case of loop formulas .",

    "but note that @xmath26 is unfounded w.r.t .",
    "@xmath26 ; moreover , every singleton is also unfounded w.r.t  @xmath26 .",

    "the next section shows that such an anomaly does not arise with our definition of an elementary loop that is extended to disjunctive programs .",
    "after providing the relevant background on disjunctive programs , this section generalizes the notions of an elementary loop and an elementarily unfounded set to disjunctive programs .",
    "we also provide the proofs of the generalizations of the statements given in the previous section ; such generalized results also apply to the class of nondisjunctive programs as a fragment of disjunctive programs .",
    "furthermore , we show that , in contrast to nondisjunctive programs , recognizing an elementary loop is intractable in the case of arbitrary disjunctive programs , but stays tractable under a certain syntactic condition .      a _ disjunctive rule _ is an expression of the form l a_1 ;  ; a_k a_k+1 ,  , a_l ,  a_l+1 ,  ,  a_m ,  a_m+1 ,  ,",
