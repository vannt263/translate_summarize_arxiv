    "a recurring feature of the dilepton ( @xmath1 ) spectra measured in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath2 ) collisions has been the enhancement ( above known sources ) in the invariant mass distribution of the cross sections in the region of the vector meson ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) pole mass .",
    "this has been the case for experiments performed for bombarding energies ranging from as low as 1 gev / nucleon ( dls data  @xcite ) , through the sps energies ( 40 - 158 gev / nucleon )  @xcite to the energies employed by the phenix collaboration at rhic ( which correspond to invariant mass of 200 gev / nucleon )  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement seen at the sps energies are understood in terms of the modification of the @xmath5 meson spectral function in the hadronic medium @xcite .    however , the large dileptons yields observed in the dls experiment ( in @xmath6c + @xmath6c and @xmath7ca + @xmath7ca collisions at 1 - 2 gev / nucleon beam energies ) in the invariant mass ( @xmath8 ) range from 0.2 gev to 0.5 gev , are yet to be explained satisfactorily  @xcite .",
    "independent transport model calculations have been unable to describe these data fully even after including contributions from ( i ) the decay of @xmath5 and @xmath4 mesons which are produced directly from the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) and pion - nucleon scattering in the early reaction phase  @xcite , ( ii ) the in - medium @xmath5 spectral functions  @xcite , ( iii ) the dropping @xmath5 mass with corresponding modification in the resonance properties  @xcite , ( iv ) an alternative scenario of the in - medium effect - a possible decoherence between the intermediate meson states in the vector resonance decay @xcite .",
    "this led to term this discrepancy as `` dls - puzzle '' @xcite which persists even now .    in order to resolve this unsatisfactory situation the high - acceptance dielectron spectrometer ( hades )",
    "has been built  @xcite which allows to study the dilepton production in elementary proton - proton ( @xmath9 ) , proton - deuteron ( @xmath10 ) as well as in proton - nucleus ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath2 collisions with much wider acceptance region for beam energies up to 8 gev / nucleon . unlike the dls experiment hades also measures the dilepton yields in the quasi - free proton - neutron ( @xmath12 ) scattering .",
    "the first set of data has already been published  @xcite by this group on @xmath6c + @xmath6c collisions at beam energies of 1.0 and 2.0 gev / nucleon .",
    "the remarkable fact is that these data agree well with those of the dls collaboration .",
    "therefore , there is no longer any question against the validity of the dls data and the previous failures to explain them by various transport models have to do with problems in the theoretical calculations .    on the theory side , in a recent hsd transport model calculation  @xcite it has been shown that if one uses larger cross sections for elementary @xmath9 and @xmath12 bremsstrahlung processes the observed dilepton yields in the relevant invariant mass region for the @xmath6c + @xmath6c collisions at 1 - 2 gev / nucleon can be reproduced .",
    "the support for the enhanced elementary bremsstrahlung cross sections comes from the calculations of these processes presented in ref .",
    "@xcite within a model which is similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite . althought the calculations perfomed within the two models use the same input parameters yet the cross sections of  @xcite are larger than those of ref .",
    "@xcite by factors of 2 - 4 .",
    "it has been further argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that elementary bremsstrahlung cross sections larger than those of ref .",
    "@xcite were reported already in ref .",
    "@xcite within a similar type of model which employes however , realistic @xmath13 matrices to describe the initial nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) collisions .    in this paper , we examine the issue of the dilepton production in the elementary @xmath0 collisions in order to highlight and understand the differences seen in the predictions of various models @xcite for the corresponding cross sections .",
    "this is important for a proper theoretical description of the new data on the dilepton production in elementary @xmath9 and @xmath12 collisions which are likely to be announced soon by the hades collaboration .",
    "this will also have vital implications for the predictions of the different transport models for the hades dilepton yields in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "indeed , in a very recent urqmd transport model analysis of the hades @xmath14 + @xmath14 data  @xcite , it has been shown that even without using the enhanced elementary bremsstrahlung cross sections of ref .",
    "@xcite the observed dilepton yields can be described fairly well at the 2.0 gev / nucleon beam energy in the region of relevant @xmath8 values .",
    "although , this theory still underpredicts the data in this mass region at the 1.0 gev / nucleon beam energy .    the major difference between models of refs .",
    "@xcite lies in the method of implementing the gauge invariance of the @xmath0 bremsstrahlung amplitudes . to investigate this issue",
    ", we have recalculated the cross sections for the dilepton production in elementary @xmath9 and @xmath12 reactions within a fully relativistic and gauge invariant model which is similar to that used in refs .",
    "@xcite [ to be referred as full quantum mechanical model ( fqm ) ] except for the fact that we have used a pseudoscalar ( ps ) nucleon - nucleon - pion ( @xmath15 ) vertex instead of the pseudovector ( pv ) one employed by these authors .",
    "the reason is that with the ps coupling , the contact term ( seagull diagram ) is not involved in the total lagrangian which however , still remains gauge invariant for bare point like nucleons . with",
    "a pv @xmath15 coupling one needs to introduce a contact term to restore the gauge invariance of the total amplitude and different approaches  @xcite for constructing this contribution lead to very different results  @xcite . the use of the ps @xmath15 vertex makes our discussions free from this ambiguity .    in the computation of the amplitudes ,",
    "strong form factors are introduced to quench the contributions from high momenta and to include effects due to the compositeness of the nucleon . however",
    ", this leads to the loss of gauge invariance .",
    "we show here that form factors at various vertices ( hadronic as well as electromagnetic ) can still be implemented in our model without loosing gauge invariance .",
    "we make a detailed comparison of the ingredients and predictions of fqm with those of the models of refs .",
    "@xcite and examine their validity critically .",
    "the predictions of the fqm is also compared with those of the semiclassical models which are used to obtain the elementary @xmath0 bremsstrahlung and delta isobar contributions to the elementary dilepton production reactions in transport models to calculate the cross sections for this reaction in @xmath2 collisions .",

    "1a and 1b ) .",
    "there are also their exchange counterparts .",
    "in addition , there are diagrams of similar types where the virtual photon is emitted from the nucleon line on the right side .",
    "the internal meson lines can also lead to dilepton emission ( see fig 1c ) . to evaluate various amplitudes",
    ", we have used the same effective lagrangians for the nucleon - nucleon - meson , resonance - nucleon - meson , nucleon - nucleon - photon and resonance - nucleon - photon vertices as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite with the sole exception that for the @xmath15 vertex we have used the ps coupling @xmath16 instead of the pv one .",
    "the parameters of the model were taken to be the same as those of ref .",
    "@xcite where details of calculations of various amplitudes are given .",
    "the on - shell equivalence of the pseudoscalar and pseudovector couplings makes the parameters independent of the choice for the type of the @xmath15 vertex .    in the computation of the amplitudes corresponding to diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1 the problem of loosing the gauge invariance arises while using the electromagnetic form factors if the complete vertex function for the half - off - shell photon production is not used @xcite .",
    "the full vertex is given by @xmath17 where operators @xmath18 are defined as @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the nucleon mass .",

    "@xcite ) . the current conservation condition ( ccc )",
    "@xmath36 = 0 is satisfied if the contributions of diagrams 1(a ) and 1(b ) are added together . in case of the exchange of charged mesons however ,",
    "the sum of these two diagrams does not vanish and one has to also include the contributions from the diagram 1(c ) to fulfill the ccc .    in actual calculations",
    "the hadronic vertices also contain strong form factors that depend on the four momenta of the exchanged mesons .",
    "therefore , for uncharged mesons , it is sufficient to multiply all the vertices by the same form factor as that of the hadronic vertices in order to keep the gauge invariance . on the other hand , the four momentum of the meson changes in fig .",
    "1(c ) for the case of the charged meson exchange and the corresponding meson current no longer satisfies the continuity equation even after being multiplied by the same hadronic form factor .",
    "one needs to multiply this form factor in diagram 1(c )  @xcite by an additional factor @xmath37 which is obtained by letting @xmath37 multiply the mesonic current and then solving for the continuity equation .",
    "this leads to  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the cut - off parameter and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the four momentum transfers at the left and right vertices of graph 1(c ) , respectively .",
    "this result can be interpreted as the photon coupling to the regular pion ( first term ) and to `` heavy '' pion at the left and right vertices ( second and third terms , respectively ) .",
    "this way of gauging the strong form factor makes it possible to use a given form factor for the meson and a different one for the nucleon but still fulfill the wti .",
    "as far as form factors for the electromagnetic vertices of the nucleons are concerned , we note that for real photons , the gauge invariance mandates @xmath31 = 1 , @xmath35 = @xmath42 and @xmath32 = 0 , where @xmath42 is the magnetic moment of the nucleon . for the actual case",
    "there is a considerable uncertainty in these form factors .",
    "@xmath32 is never accessible by experiments since @xmath43 = 0 for any conserved current .",
    "as in previous studies  @xcite we have chosen not to include electromagnetic form factors for the nucleon .",
    "we now compare our model with those of refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , instead of the one - boson exchange picture of our model , the nucleon - nucleon interaction is included via a @xmath13-matrix that is based on the paris potential .",
    "however , the nucleon current is not gauge invariant in this model .",
    "these authors rectify this problem in an ad - hoc manner which may not have a microscopic basis . in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , a pseudovector @xmath15 coupling has been used . with this coupling gauge invariance",
    "is preserved with a contact term ( @xmath44 vertex ) added to the total lagrangian .",
    "however , once hadronic form factors are introduced the gauge invariance will be violated and a gauge restoration procedure has to be applied  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the same method as described above , has been used for restoring gauge invariance in the case of @xmath9 collisions .",
    "no contact graph due to pseudovector coupling appears in this case . for the @xmath45 case however ,",
    "a contact term is needed .",
    "different approaches for constructing the additional current contribution ( contact term ) to restore gauge invariance lead to different types of form factors  @xcite which can yield quite different results  @xcite .",
    "the usual practice is to choose a prescription which provides best agreement with the data .",

    "first of all we remark that the cross sections calculated in the present work are very similar to those reported in our earlier work  @xcite - their shapes are unchanged while absolute magnitudes of the former are slightly larger than those of the latter ( by about 10@xmath46 ) .",
    "however , the cross sections reported for the @xmath9 case in ref .  @xcite ( to be referred as djm ) are larger than ours for invariant mass ( @xmath8 ) @xmath47 0.25 gev at the beam energy of 1.04 gev while they are almost identical for 2.09 gev in this mass region . at both the beam energies , djm results are smaller than ours for @xmath48 0.25 gev . on the other hand , the cross sections of ref .",
    "@xcite ( to be referred at kk ) are larger than our results everywhere in the region of @xmath49 gev . an important point to note",

    ", it is worthwhile to note that for the real photon production , the covariant model calculations do not depend on the choice of the @xmath15 coupling ( ps or pv ) as is shown in ref .  @xcite . in case of dileptons , different results can arise for two couplings from the magnetic part of the @xmath50 vertex .",
    "in fact , in ref .  @xcite it is shown that @xmath9 dilepton bremsstrahlung contributions obtained with the pv @xmath15 coupling are actually smaller than those calculated with the ps one at the beam energy of 2 gev .",

    "we note that here too the kk cross sections are larger than ours by factors of @xmath52 2 at smaller values of m even though the two models have used the same ingredients and input parameters for this part and there is no ambiguity related to gauge invariance as the resonance vertex is gauge invariant by its very construction .",

    "the cross sections calculated within our model are folded with appropriate experimental filter and final mass resolution .",
    "the folded kk cross sections have been obtained by assuming that the folding procedure does not affect the ratios of the unfolded cross sections in the two cases . in this figure",
    "we have also shown cross sections for the @xmath53 dalitz decay ( @xmath54 ) which are the same as those shown in ref .",
    "it is seen that kk cross sections overestimate the dls data for @xmath55 0.3 gev where statistical errors are smaller .",
    "the data have larger error bars for @xmath48 0.3 gev . in this context the hades data on the elementary dilepton production reactions are expected to be useful because of their low statistical error .    in the several transport model calculations of dilepton production in the @xmath2 collisions ,",
    "the usual practice is to calculate the nucleon bremsstrahlung contributions within a soft photon approximation ( spa ) model  @xcite and the delta contribution within a dalitz decay ( ddd ) model  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding cross sections are added up to get the total elementary dilepton production cross sections .",
    "in the spa model , the radiation from the internal lines [ fig .",
    "1(c ) ] is neglected and the strong interaction vertex is assumed to be on - shell ( which is reasonable only for small photon energies ) .",
    "this cross section is corrected by including a multiplicative factor which is the ratio of the phase space available to the two - nucleon system with or without the emission of a dilepton of invariant mass @xmath8  @xcite .",

    "@xcite is not gauge invariant .",
    "an important point to note is that there is no overall multiplicative factor to differentiate our cross sections from those of ref .",
    "it is expected that the results from the hades group on the dilepton production in @xmath9 and @xmath10 collisions  @xcite would provide a fresh ground for differentiating between various models .",
    "calculations performed with a pseudovector @xmath15 coupling are more appealing because this coupling is consistent with the chiral symmetry requirement of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite and also because it leads to negligible contributions from the negative energy states ( pair suppression phenomena ) @xcite . however , in calculations with pv @xmath15 vertex the contact terms resulting from different prescriptions of restoring the gauge invariance will have to be carefully examined .",
    "this work is currently underway .",
    "we found that the total dilepton production cross sections in the elementary @xmath0 collisions as calculated within the semiclassical models and used in most transport calculations , differ noticeably from those predicted by the full quantum mechanical model .",
