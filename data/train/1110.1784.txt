    "heterogeneous nucleation also occurs in cell biology during the assembly of sickle hemoglobin @xcite , @xmath0-amyloid fibers @xcite , arp2/3 complex - mediated actin nucleation @xcite , and probably during clathrin - coat assembly @xcite . within biochemical applications , ligand - receptor binding",
    "can also be viewed as a particular paradigm of heterogeneous nucleation , where multiple ligands bind to a single receptor akin to an impurity seed in solid - state nucleation .",
    "viewed through this lens , nucleation is ubiquitous in cell biology .",
    "indeed , receptor loading levels control a variety of biochemical reactions , from viral entry to cell signalling .",
    "the chemical stoichiometries involved in ligand - binding events however , may limit the maximum number of ligands a receptor can hold to about a dozen .",
    "for example , hemoglobin can bind at most four oxygen molecules @xcite , virus - cell fusion occurs after a small number of cell surface receptors bind to a viral protein @xcite , and cell - signaling is initiated after a certain number of phosphates bind to specific enzymes @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to most physical and chemical systems where aggregation of an unlimited number of particles can lead to the emergence of macroscopic structures .",
    "seeds ( open hexagons ) are available to bind @xmath1 initial monomers ( filled dots).,width=316 ]    an even more critical feature of nucleation in cellular settings is the small system volumes involved and , as a consequence , the presence of a finite number of monomeric ligands driving the nucleation process . in the small volumes encountered in cells , ligand production and degradation are often slower processes than attachment and detachment to receptors , allowing certain ligands to be depleted @xcite .",
    "because there is no source to replenish the free ligand concentration , receptors in confined , isolated systems compete amongst themselves for the finite pool of free monomeric ligands , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for simplicity , throughout the remainder of this paper , the terms `` monomers '' and `` ligands '' will be used interchangeably , as will `` seeds '' and `` receptors . ''",

    "we study its _ heterogeneous _ counterpart , relevant for ligand - receptor kinetics in biology . while heterogeneous nucleation has been well studied ,",
    "most theoretical treatments focus on computing equilibrium partition functions for nucleation with specific forms for the free energy of monomer association @xcite .",
    "many other approaches focus on either the molecular details and geometry of an individual cluster particle @xcite , or on the asymptotic dynamics of even more coarse - grained continuum size distributions @xcite . in many applications , a constant source of monomers",

    ", we will instead consider the dynamics of a system with a total fixed number @xmath2 of monomeric ligands ( bound and unbound ) and a fixed number @xmath3 of receptor seeds .",
    "each receptor can bind at the most @xmath4 monomeric ligands according to the spatially - uniform mass - action equations we describe in the next section .",
    "two qualitatively different cases are analyzed . in section iii",
    ", we first consider irreversible binding , where the detachment rate is strictly zero so that once attached , monomers can not detach from clusters .",
    "irreversibility leads to a loss of ergodicity since only a fraction of the possible cluster configurations will be sampled during the dynamics , while many others will never be visited . as a result ,",
    "the final `` quenched '' or `` metastable '' cluster size distribution is not an equilibrium one and depends strongly on initial conditions .",
    "ergodicity is restored in the case of a non - zero detachment rate , where all possible cluster configurations are eventually sampled and where the cluster sizes approach an equilibrium distribution , independent of the initial configuration .",
    "reversible binding , in the limit of small unbinding rates , is in analyzed section iv .",
    "several studies of homogeneous nucleation have shown the existence of long lived metastable states followed by final equilibration , or `` coarsening '' , to a very different cluster size distribution .",
    "these results were found for nucleating systems driven by an infinite supply of monomers and while allowing clusters to grow without bound @xcite .",
    "our results for mass - conserving heterogeneous nucleation show a similar coarsening behavior .",
    "the steady - state cluster distributions arising from the irreversible and reversible dynamics are very different from each other , especially in the limit of small particle numbers and even in the case of vanishingly small detachment rates . in the latter case , when unbinding is very slow compared to binding , relaxation to the true equilibrium cluster size distribution occurs over the long time scales associated with unbinding . as a result ,",
    "cluster concentrations reach long - lived metastable plateaus that depend on initial conditions and that can be closely approximated by results obtained from considering irreversible dynamics , as treated in section iii . only at longer times ,",
    "after monomers start unbinding in appreciable numbers , does this metastable size distribution `` coarsen '' and cross over to the true equilibrium one .",
    "while the metastable and equilibrium cluster distributions are generally very different , we find a surprising result : for certain sets of parameters , special cluster sizes have identical metastable and equilibrium concentrations . for these clusters , the equilibration process appears to be dramatically accelerated . in section",
    "v we find the exact mathematical relationship leading to the apparent fast coarsening where certain clusters reach equilibrium concentrations well before the rest .",
    "our results are a consequence of total mass conservation , and do not arise in the case of receptors binding an unlimited supply of free ligand monomers .",
    "finally , in the conclusions , we discuss implications and future extensions of our work .",
    "to begin our analysis , we consider a model of heterogeneous nucleation for @xmath2 well - mixed monomeric ligands binding sequentially @xcite to any of the @xmath3 uniformly dispersed ligand seeds , neglecting fragmentation and aggregation that do not involve monomers , since they have been treated in other contexts @xcite .",
    "we also assume that each seed can accommodate at most @xmath4 monomers due to stoichiometry constraints and consider the mean - field mass - action equations for the number of clusters @xmath5 of size @xmath6 , where @xmath7 . here",
    ", @xmath8 indicates  naked seeds \" , with no bound monomers , and @xmath9 saturated ones , where no further binding is possible . in general , monomer attachment and detachment rates from a cluster of size @xmath6 can be explicitly @xmath6-dependent .",
    "specific forms for @xmath10 and @xmath11 have been used to describe cooperativity and the nucleation of clusters of various shapes and in different dimensions .",
    "for instance , @xmath12 and constant @xmath11 are typically used to model 2d nucleation of circular droplets when monomer binding is not diffusion - limited @xcite . in our work , we assume that while detachment is independent of the number of particles in the free monomer pool , the attachment process depends only on how many monomers remain unbound .",
    "the `` becker - dring '' equations for @xmath13 can thus be written as    @xmath14   \\dot{c}_{k } & = -p_{k}m(t)c_{k } - q_{k}c_{k } + p_{k-1}m(t)c_{k-1 } + q_{k+1}c_{k+1 } , \\\\[13pt ]   \\dot{c}_{n } & = - q_{n}c_{n } + p_{n-1}m(t ) c_{n-1}. \\\\ \\end{array }   \\label{odehetero2}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent monomer attachment and detachment rates , respectively .",
    "the attachment rate is proportional to @xmath17 , the number of free monomers available for binding    @xmath18    note , that although these equations are written assuming finite particle numbers , they can also describe concentrations , given a normalizing reference concentration .",
