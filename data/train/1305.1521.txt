    "<S> these states have exactly one spin on each triangle pointing in ( @xmath62)-direction which corresponds to an energy per site @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the duality to the kagome tfim then implies that the quantum fluctuations induced by the plaquette operators @xmath64 directly select a quantum disordered topologically ordered ground state ( a @xmath0 spin liquid ) which persists for any value of @xmath60 up to the limit of the bare toric code .    </S>",
    "<S> next we discuss under which conditions the low - energy physics of the toric code in an @xmath25-field is indeed contained in the charge - free sector . </S>",
    "<S> this question can be answered in the limit @xmath61 where all eigen states are classical states . </S>",
    "<S> a natural competitor to the charge - free states is then the fully - polarized state @xmath65 where all spins point in ( @xmath66)-direction , since this state minimizes the field term for @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> its energy per site is given by @xmath67 because one has @xmath35 and @xmath68 for all triangles and stars . </S>",
    "<S> the classical charge - free states therefore have a lower energy than the polarized state @xmath65 whenever @xmath69 for @xmath61 . </S>",

    "<S> the plaquette eigenvalues @xmath41 are still conserved quantities and each flux sector can be studied separately . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining degrees of freedom are then the charge excitations on triangles and stars which live on a dual dice lattice ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we give the explicit construction of such a duality mapping between the conventional toric code in a field on the square lattice and the fully - frustrated tfim on the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this construction can be generalized to other lattices in a straightforward manner . to be specific , we study @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and we assume @xmath52 without loss of generality . </S>",

    "<S> usually , positive couplings are considered . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy physics takes place in the charge - free sector with @xmath91 for all @xmath4 , and the well - known duality between the @xmath0 gauge theory and the _ unfrustrated _ tfim on the dual square lattice applies @xcite . as a consequence , a quantum phase transition in the 3d ising universality class between the topologically ordered phase and the polarized phase is detected for @xmath92 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics is strongly different for the choice with @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the topologically ordered ground state in the absence of the magnetic field @xmath39 is then in the _ charge - full _ </S>",
    "<S> sector @xmath94 for all sites @xmath4 ( @xmath95 for all plaquette operators @xmath96 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a finite magnetic field gives then rise to mobile fluxes which hop in the background of static charges . </S>",
    "<S> performing the same kind of duality mapping as above by introducing pseudo - spin operators on the sites of the dual square lattice ( of plaquettes ) , one finds that the charge - full sector is dual to the fully frustrated tfim on the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> note that such dualities between odd ising gauge theories and fully frustrated tfim have been already discussed in the context of quantum dimer models @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fully frustrated tfim on the square lattice realizes a 3d xy quantum phase transition @xcite between the polarized phase and a columnar ordered phase at a critical ratio @xmath97 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the extension of the topological phase ( corresponding to the polarized phase in the dual language ) is again enlarged due to the frustration . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the frustration in the tfim is induced by the presence of the background charge in the charge - full sector of the topological phase .    as for the perturbed toric code on the dice lattice , one has to investigate the role of other charge sectors for the low - energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the magnetic field term favors the fully polarized state @xmath24 where all spins point in @xmath98-direction . </S>",
    "<S> this state is in the _ charge - free _ sector and , as a consequence , one expects a first - order phase transition at a certain ratio @xmath55 when the charge - free sector contains the true ground state of the system . for @xmath99 , </S>",
    "<S> the classical energies per site are given by @xmath100 and @xmath101 such that the charge - full sector contains the ground state for @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is always possible to stabilize the charge - full sector including the 3d xy quantum phase transition by enlarging the ratio @xmath103 .    for the specific case with @xmath93 , we have calculated the ground - state energy per site @xmath104 of the topological phase up to order 8 in @xmath55 which is equivalent to the ground - state energy per site of the polarized phase in the dual fully frustrated tfim on the square lattice ( up to the constant energy due to the presence of charges ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy @xmath104 has to be compared to the ground - state energy per site of the charge - free sector . </S>",
    "<S> the latter sector is dual to the conventional unfrustrated tfim on the square lattice ( up to a constant energy offset due to the absence of charges ) and series expansions of @xmath105 for the ordered and disordered phase are available @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , by comparing both sectors , it can be clearly deduced that the low - energy physics takes place in the charge - full sector for @xmath55 well larger than the 3d xy quantum critical point at @xmath106 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the presence of the background charge , or equivalently the geometric frustration in the dual picture , leads to a different universality class compared to the charge - free ( unfrustrated ) case .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions  _ in this work we studied the impact of geometric frustration on topologically ordered quantum matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the robustness of topological order is enhanced if the kinetics of anyonic excitations is reduced due to the geometric frustration . </S>",
