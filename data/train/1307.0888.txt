    "there are several techniques for approximating @xmath40 in the literature .",
    "the most natural approach is to introduce a ( finite dimensional ) numerical approximation @xmath7 of @xmath1 and obtain an approximation @xmath41 using an expression similar to but involving the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the difficulty with this approach is that the direct evaluation of the resulting approximation is computationally very expensive .",

    "an alternative approach for approximating @xmath44 ( or a more general elliptic partial differential equation ) is based on a representation of @xmath43 via a `` neumann to dirichlet '' map @xcite .",
