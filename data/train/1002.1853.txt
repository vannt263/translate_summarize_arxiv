    "galaxies consist of vast numbers of stars formed from molecular clouds .",
    "it has therefore been suggested that the process of star formation in galaxies depends largely on the distribution , kinematics , and physical conditions of the molecular gas .",
    "one of the primary molecular gas properties critical to star formation is the number density .",
    "observational studies of molecular clouds in our galaxy suggest that stars are formed from the dense locale of molecular clouds , rather than the diffuse regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "extragalactic single - dish molecular gas observations indicate that the overall amount of dense molecular gas , which can be traced by the hcn(1  0 ) luminosity , is tightly correlated with the global star formation rate , which can in turn be traced by the far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity observed with the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) @xcite .",
    "this correlation is much tighter than that between the diffuse molecular gas , or in other words , the total amount of molecular gas that can be traced by @xmath0co(1  0 ) , and the global star formation rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite also raise the possibility of the fact that the hcn/@xmath0co luminosity ratio correlates well with the fir/@xmath0co luminosity ratio , namely the fraction of dense molecular gas correlates well with the star formation efficiency , and this suggests that hcn/@xmath0co is a good indicator for star formation .",
    "high spatial resolution interferometric observations toward the center of a galaxy with a high infrared luminosity indicate that extragalactic star forming regions coincide well with the distributions of dense molecular gas ( hcn ) @xcite .",
    "the distributions of diffuse molecular gas ( @xmath0co ) , on the other hand , only loosely match those of star forming regions . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the hcn/@xmath0co integrated intensity ratios are high ( @xmath6 ) in active star forming regions in the centers of galaxies with high infrared luminosity ( @xmath7 l@xmath8 ) , but low ( @xmath9 ) in the centers of galaxies with low star forming activities or post - starburst activities @xcite .",
    "star forming regions in the outer parts of galaxies , where normally have low infrared luminosities or low star formation rate , have low hcn/@xmath0co at giant molecular cloud scale @xcite .",
    "these results strongly imply that the density of molecular gas play a critical role in the active star formation phenomena .",
    "the relation between star formation and temperature , another important molecular gas property , has so far not been well established .",
    "there are several surveys observing @xmath0co(2  1 ) and @xmath0co(1  0 ) lines toward galaxies with various star formation activities ( such as starburst , interacting , and quiescent galaxies ) , and most of the surveys yield an average @xmath0co(2  1)/(1  0 ) of around unity @xcite .",
    "surveys focusing on the @xmath0co(3  2 ) and @xmath0co(1  0 ) lines indicate that variations in @xmath0co(3  2)/(1  0 ) tend to have somewhat larger dependence on star formation activities as compared to @xmath0co(2 ",
    "1)/(1  0 ) ; starburst galaxies tend to have higher @xmath0co(3  2)/(1  0 ) of around unity , but normal galaxies tend to have lower ratio of around 0.5 or lower @xcite .",
    "these multi - transition @xmath0co observations suggest that the @xmath0co lines in nearby normal and starburst galaxies are optically thick , with a tendency to be saturated to unity , namely thermalized , in the vicinity of certain star formation activities .",
    "it is therefore difficult to deduce correlations between star formation activities and multi - transition @xmath0co ratios .",
    "the intensities of the @xmath1co(1  0 ) lines , on the other hand , display more drastic changes than those of the @xmath0co lines with respect to star formation activities . in merging galaxies ,",
    "the @xmath1co(1  0 ) intensities tend to be very low , and @xmath0co(1 ",
    "0)/@xmath1co(1  0 ) often exceed 20 , in contrast to normal or starburst galaxies ( not including extreme starbursts ) that have an average value of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , this clear contrast in @xmath0co(1  0)/@xmath1co(1  0 ) is only manifested between merging galaxies and normal / starburst galaxies , and there exists only a weak trend between normal and starburst galaxies as a function of dust temperature or the 60  @xmath11 m and 100  @xmath11 m fir flux ratio @xcite .    in the study of m51 multi - line observations",
    ", we discovered an excellent density and temperature probe , the hcn(1  0)/@xmath1co(1  0 ) ratio ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ; @xcite ) .",
    "the utility of this ratio has been confirmed by higher - j interferometric @xmath0co observations @xcite .    in this paper , we present hcn(1  0 ) , @xmath1co(1  0 ) , and @xmath0co(1  0 ) observations toward galaxies with various levels of star formation activities , and discuss the relation between the physical conditions of molecular gas and the levels of star formation activities .",
    "in addition , we compare the ir properties of these galaxies , and show that the molecular gas and dust are localized in similar regions and strongly irradiated by the radiation from starburst regions .",

    "our sample galaxies extend over a wide range of the ir flux ratios , covering most of the range of the diagrams shown in @xcite and @xcite , thus ensuring the wide coverage of star formation activities .      among the starburst galaxy samples are m82 , ngc  253 , ngc  2146 , ngc  3504 , ngc  2903 , ngc  6946 , and ngc  6951 , whose fir luminosities are on the order of @xmath21  l@xmath8 @xcite .",

    "since these strong balmer absorption lines are typically found in the spectra of a - type stars , stellar populations of galaxies with such absorption lines are believed to be dominated by a - type stars .",
    "indeed , the stellar population synthesis analysis implies that the dominant stellar populations of ngc  4736 and ngc  5195 extend up to at most a4 to a7 , and that the optical light is dominated by these stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the likely mechanism for the creation of `` a - type star dominated ''",
    "galaxies is as follows : starburst phenomena produce enormous numbers of early to late - type stars , assuming a general initial mass function .",
    "early - type stars ( ob stars ) live at most @xmath26 years , so that at the time @xmath25 years after the beginning of the starburst , the early - type stars are burned out , with vast numbers of a - type stars remaining .",
    "therefore , galaxies with numerous a - type stars can be considered post - starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "molecular gas observations support the hypothesis that , in the balmer absorption dominated regions , there is little molecular gas @xcite . in some cases",
    ", molecular gas exists in the `` a - type star dominated '' galaxies , but it is stable against gravitational instability @xcite with almost no high - density gas present @xcite .",

    "<S> we performed @xmath0co(1  0 ) , @xmath1co(1  0 ) , and hcn(1  0 ) single - dish observations ( beam size @xmath2 ) toward nearby starburst and non - starburst galaxies using the nobeyama 45  m telescope . the @xmath1co(1  0 ) and hcn(1  0 ) emissions were detected from all the seven starburst galaxies , with the intensities of both lines being similar ( i.e. , the ratios are around unity ) . on the other hand , for case of the non - starburst galaxies , the @xmath1co(1  0 ) </S>",
    "<S> emission was detected from all three galaxies , while the hcn(1  0 ) emission was weakly or not detected in past observations . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that the hcn/@xmath1co intensity ratios are significantly larger ( @xmath3 ) in the starburst galaxy samples than the non - starburst galaxy samples ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the large - velocity - gradient model suggests that the molecular gas in the starburst galaxies have warmer and denser conditions than that in the non - starburst galaxies , and the photon - dominated - region model suggests that the denser molecular gas is irradiated by stronger interstellar radiation field in the starburst galaxies than that in the non - starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , hcn/@xmath1co in our sample galaxies exhibit strong correlations with the iras @xmath5 flux ratios . it is a well established fact that there exists a strong correlation between dense molecular gas and star formation activities , but our results suggest that molecular gas temperature is also an important parameter . </S>"
