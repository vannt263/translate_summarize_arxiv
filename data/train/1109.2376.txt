    "the search for higgs bosons and new physics particles and the study of their properties are among the prime objectives of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) , a single neutral higgs boson",
    "is predicted as a direct consequence of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . moreover , charged higgs bosons are predicted in extended versions of the sm , such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . since the discovery of such an additional higgs boson will be the evidence of new physics beyond the sm , there is increasing interest in theoretical and experimental studies to provide the basis for its accurate exploration .",

    "@xcite , which shows that a favorable scenario for @xmath8 associated production would be characterized by the conditions that @xmath9 and that @xmath10 are either close to unity or of order @xmath11 , then the @xmath12 bosons could not spring from on - shell top quarks and could be copiously produced at hadron colliders . a complete one - loop calculation of the loop - induced subprocess @xmath13 is presented in the framework of the mssm @xcite , which shows the cross section of @xmath13 can be comparable to that of @xmath6 due to the large number of gluons in the high energy proton beams at the lhc .",
    "technicolor theory @xcite is one of the important candidates for probing new physics beyond the sm , especially the topcolor assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) model proposed by c. t. hill @xcite  this combines technicolor with topcolor , with the former being mainly responsible for ewsb and the latter for generating a major part of the top quark mass . if technicolor is actually responsible for ewsb , there are strong phenomenological arguments that its energy scale is at most a few hundred gev and that the lightest technicolor pions are within reach of the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the tc2 model predicts three top pions ( @xmath14 ) , one top higgs ( @xmath15 ) and the new gauge bosons ( @xmath16 ) with large yukawa couplings to the third generation quarks , so these new particles can be regarded as a typical feature of this model .",
    "lots of signals of this model have already been studied in the work environment of linear colliders and hadron - hadron colliders @xcite , but most attention has been focused on the neutral top pion and new gauge bosons . here",
    "we wish to discuss the prospects of charged top pions .    for the production of charged top pion in association with a @xmath0 boson at the lhc",
    ", there are mainly two partonic subprocesses that contribute to the hadronic cross section @xmath17 : the @xmath18 annihilation and the @xmath1 fusion . ref .",
    "@xcite has already studied the process of @xmath19 associated production via @xmath18 annihilation at the tree level and the one - loop , which shows that the total cross section @xmath20 is rather large when @xmath21 is not very heavy . in this paper",
    "we shall discuss the production of top pions @xmath22 in association with sm gauge bosons @xmath23 via @xmath1 fusuion , including the contributions arising from top pions @xmath14 and top higgs @xmath15 , to search for new physics particles and test the tc2 model .",

    "this process is induced at the one - loop level by diagrams with quark - loops .",
    "the quark - loop diagrams can be subdivided into box - type diagrams and into triangle diagrams . in each box diagram , the quarks in the loop couple directly to the outgoing charged higgs boson @xmath25 , while in the triangle diagrams the quarks couple to one of the neutral top pion and top higgs boson .",

    "[ fig : eps2 ] , the total cross section @xmath77 as a function of @xmath78 for @xmath81 at the lhc with @xmath82 is given , in which the solid lines , the dashed lines , and the dotted lines denote , respectively , the cases of @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . from this diagram , we can see that ( i ) the total cross section decreases quickly as @xmath78 increase , changes the values from @xmath85 to @xmath86 with the range of @xmath78 , @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and from @xmath90 to @xmath86 for @xmath88 and @xmath91 , respectively ; ( ii ) the cross section is sensitive to @xmath70 and @xmath92 when @xmath78 is small , but this sensitivity will disappear for a rather heavy top pion ; and ( iii ) when @xmath80 , the cross section of @xmath74 associated production via @xmath1 fusion roughly @xmath93 , and is rather large .",
    "figure [ fig : eps3 ] gives the plots of the fully integrated cross section via gg fusion versus @xmath70 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we can observe that ( i ) the cross section is not sensitive to @xmath70 , and only decreases by @xmath96 in the range of @xmath97 for @xmath89 ; and ( ii ) the case of @xmath91 is almost the same as that of @xmath89 .",
    "we know that there are mainly two parton subprocesses that contribute to the hadronic cross section @xmath3 : the @xmath18 annihilation and the @xmath1 fusion . in order to look at the contributions from these two subprocess , we take @xmath98 and @xmath79 , @xmath99 and @xmath84 as an example and plot their total cross sections in fig . [",
    "fig : eps4 ] .",
    "we find from this figure , ( i ) when @xmath78 takes a small value , the total cross section @xmath100 via @xmath18 annihilation can reach several hundred femtobarns , however , the case of @xmath1 fusion is only a few dozen femtobarns , and it is evident that the former is far larger than the latter ; ( ii ) all the total cross sections from these two subprocess are only from one dozen to two dozens femtobarns for a large value of @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , the total cross section of @xmath74 associated production at the lhc should be the sum over these two parton subprocesses .",
    "as is known , at the lhc , the integrated luminosity is expected to reach @xmath82 per year .",
    "this shows that a cross section of @xmath101 could translate into about 60 detectable @xmath102 events per year @xcite . looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : eps4 ] , we thus conclude that , if @xmath80 and @xmath91 , depending on @xmath70 , one should be able to collect an annual total between @xmath103 and @xmath104 events .",
    "so the @xmath74 signal should be clearly visible at the lhc unless @xmath78 is very large .",
    "the total cross section of @xmath3 versus @xmath78 with @xmath91 for @xmath79 ( solid ) , @xmath99 ( dashed ) and @xmath84 ( dotted ) . ]    in conclusion , we have calculated the technicolor corrections to the cross section for @xmath74 associated production via @xmath1 fusion at the cern s lhc in the topcolor assisted technicolor model .",
    "we find that , the total cross section of @xmath2 , is several dozen femtobarns with reasonable values of the parameters , and the total cross section of @xmath3 can reach a few hundred femtobarns when we consider the sum of the contributions of these two parton subprocesses @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it is so large that the signal of the charged top pion should be clearly visible at the lhc .",
