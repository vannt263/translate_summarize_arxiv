    "following the detection of an apparent h  i bar within 2kpc of the galactic center , by liszt & burton ( 1980 ) , blitz & spergel ( 1991 ) found that the 2.4@xmath7 imaging data of matsumoto et al .",
    "( 1982 ) showed the presence of a tilted bar in the galactic bulge .",
    "that part of the bar closest to the sun was at positive galactic longitudes .",
    "these conclusions were primarily based on the observed fluxes for latitudes @xmath8=39@xmath1 and longitudes at @xmath9=0,@xmath510@xmath1 .",
    "stanek et al . ( 1994 , 1997 ) studied v and i photometry of red clump ( rc ) stars toward the bulge at longitudes of @xmath9@xmath21,@xmath55@xmath1 ( latitudes near @xmath10=@xmath114@xmath1 ) and found a systematically fainter rcs from positive to negative longitude .",
    "this was interpreted , and modelled , as a distance effect which was fit with a tri - axial structure , or tilted bar , with the near - side at positive galactic longitudes .",

    "in particular , they find that the bulge at @xmath118@xmath12 and @xmath114@xmath12 rotates cylindrically , as do boxy bulges of other galaxies",
    ".    recently , mcwilliam et al . (",
    "2010 ) and zoccali ( 2010 ) independently found evidence for two red clumps toward the galactic bulge region . in the current paper",
    "we outline and expand on the evidence of this joint discovery and map the extent of the double red clump over the bulge region .",
    "the data discussed here come from the following four photometric catalogs available in the literature :    _ i ) _ the 2mass point source catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "_ ii ) _ optical @xmath13 wfi photometry at the 2.2 m eso / mpg telescope at la silla , for a @xmath14 arcmin field at @xmath15 ( zoccali et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "_ iii ) _ near ir @xmath16 photometry from sofi at the ntt in la silla , for a @xmath17 arcmin field centered at @xmath18 ( zoccali et al .",

    "iv ) _ the ogle @xmath19 maps of the galactic bulge , from udalski et al . ( 2002 ) .    in figure  [ cmd_b6 ]",
    "we show the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the bulge region centered approximately at @xmath20 , along the minor axis , from four independent photometric data sets , all of them showing a double peaked horizontal branch red clump .",
    "the upper panels show the wfi ( left ) and ogle ( right ) optical cmds together with the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of rgb stars falling inside the diagonal strip marked in the cmd . the reddening free magnitude @xmath21 magnitude is defined as @xmath22 . ]",
    "was used , following rattenbury et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and adopting the extinction values given in sumi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the ogle fields .",
    "the ogle field shown here is the number 7 , centered at @xmath23 .",
    "it is worth noticing that rattenbury et al .",
    "( 2007 ) data also show a double peaked red clump in this field ( c.f . , their fig .  5 ) .",
    "the red thin histograms in both panels show the lf of the ogle field centered in baade s window ( sc46 ) , where the red clump is significantly narrower and uni - modal .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ cmd_b6 ] show the near ir cmds and lfs from the sofi photometry ( left ) and the 2mass point source catalog ( right ) .",
    "again , the red clump is double peaked in this field .",
    "the lf for baade s window is also shown as a red thin histogram .",
    "the latter was obtained by selecting a 0.8 square degree field , centered at at @xmath24 , from the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "unfortunately at @xmath25 the completeness of the 2mass catalog drops abruptly below the red clump , therefore the comparison is not as conclusive as the one for the ogle catalogs .",
    "the 2mass color - magnitude diagram in figure  [ fig - cmd-10 - 80 ] shows the two rcs at ( @xmath3)=(@xmath111,@xmath118 ) , which appear tilted , consistent with the predicted metallicity - dependence of the teramo isochrones ( pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 ) . the figure also clearly shows that the two rcs possess similar range and mean ( j@xmath11k ) colors ; as in figure  1 this suggests that the reddening is foreground and small , and that the two rc populations possess a similar range and mean metallicities .",
    "the mean ( j@xmath11k)@xmath26 color differences between bright and faint rcs for the 16 fields in this paper that contain both rcs is 0.017@xmath50.003 magnitudes .",
    "thus , the colors are practically identical , but in all cases the brighter rc is slightly redder than the faint rc .",
    "this systematic difference is in the right sense and size to be due to the change in color of the background red giant branch population between the bright and faint rcs .",
    "a small metallicity difference ( about 0.1 dex ) , between bright and faint rcs could produce the color shift , but it would still be necessary to subtract the red giant branch background effect ; thus , any metallicity difference must be smaller than @xmath20.1 dex .",
    "figure  [ cmd_b6 ] and [ fig - cmd-10 - 80 ] suggests that the double clump might be due to the presence of two populations at two different distances .",
    "a magnitude difference of @xmath27 at @xmath28 kpc would correspond to a distance difference of @xmath29 kpc .",
    "we note here for the first time that in the outer bulge , along the minor axis , bright and faint red clumps coexist , as if the near and far side of the bar both extend towards the minor axis .",
    "figure  [ cmd_b6 ] demonstrates that the horizontal branch red clump in the field at @xmath20 is significantly broader than the one of baade s window at @xmath25 .",
    "if the double - peaked rcs are due to the distances of two populations , the observations immediately appear inconsistent with a single tilted bar .",
    "it is , therefore , important to ask whether the double - peaked rcs could have resulted from stellar evolution , or to effects other than distance .",
    "a few points can be addressed by looking at these figures .",
    "first of all , the double clump is real .",
    "it is not an artifact of bad photometry , such as a bad match of mosaic data , because it is present in several independent catalogs .",
    "we have checked that it is present in each of the 8 chips of the wfi mosaic .",
    "second , the two peaks can not be due to the rgb bump ( nor the agb bump ) falling close to the rc because in that case the two would also occur in baade s window .    also , as we will see in figures  [ fig - lon ] & [ fig - lon7 ] , the relative strength of the two rc peaks changes dramatically with longitude ,",
    "while the population ratios of rgb bump , agb bump and hb red clump depend on the evolutionary time of these phases , and therefore should be independent of the line of sight",
    ".    the double clump can not be due to two extinction patches in this particular direction , because in that case the separation between the two peaks would be smaller in the @xmath30 band , compared to the @xmath31 band .",
    "instead , the separation is roughly comparable in all the filters .",
    "in addition , as mentioned above , the two peaks look very similar in the 8 chips of the wfi mosaic .",
    "this would not be the case if they were due to extinction patches .",
    "finally , were extinction responsible for the two peaks , the clump that is @xmath32 magnitudes fainter would also be @xmath33 magnitudes redder than the other one in @xmath34 , which is clearly not the case .    the predicted rc@xmath11rgb bump i - band magnitude differences from the teramo stellar evolution code ( e.g. , pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 ) increase with metallicity , and a match to the observed difference between our putative rcs occurs for 12gyr isochrone at solar metallicity .",
    "however , the predicted rc numbers exceed those of the rgb bump by roughly a factor of 10 .",
    "this presents a particularly severe problem for the negative longitude fields ( see figure  [ fig - lon ] ) , where the faint component dominates , so the proposed rgb bump population exceeds the rc , completely at odds with current stellar evolution ideas .",
    "the rgb bump / rc ratio for the negative longitude bulge fields of figure  [ fig - lon ] exceed the stellar evolution predictions by more than a factor of 30 .",
    "this might be qualitatively understood if metal - rich bulge stars largely terminate their evolution prematurely , after the rgb bump but before the rc , say if their metallicity is higher than currently realized and they experienced significantly enhanced mass - loss .",
    "however , as noted above , it would then be necessary to understand why stellar evolution on the giant branch is so different on the positive and negative longitude sides of the bulge ; as a result there would still be two separate bulge populations .",
    "the similarity of the j@xmath11k colors of the two populations suggests that there is very little metallicity difference .",
    "given these difficulties , the idea that our two rcs are due to rc plus rgb bump is not a tenable hypothesis .",
    "it is likely that the rgb bump is detected as a very small peak in some of the panels of figure  [ fig - lon ] ; the main effect of the rgb bump is to reduce the clarity of the fainter rc peaks .",
    "theoretical isochrone rc k - band magnitudes and ( j@xmath11k ) colors display metallicity - dependence : more metal - rich rc stars are redder in ( j@xmath11k ) and brighter in k. this effect is clearly evident in the teramo group stellar evolution models ( e.g. , pietrinferni et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions show that rc m@xmath35 is brighter for younger ages ; however , no single age can account for the observed 0.65 mag .",
    "difference in rc k@xmath36 seen of figure  [ fig - cmd-10 - 80 ] and [ fig - lon ] for solar - metallicity isochrones , unlike the case for the i - band .",
    "the closest that the theoretical rc predictions come to to the observations , at solar composition , is for ages at 2 and 14 gyrs , but this only accounts for @xmath37m@xmath35 of 0.28 mag .",
    "a combination of age and metallicity effects could explain the brightness of the observed rc peaks , but this requires unrealistic ages and a mean [ fe / h ] near @xmath110.5 dex , which is in conflict with measured bulge abundances .",
    "for latitude @xmath118@xmath12 the age explanation would require the majority of stars at positive longitudes to be 2gyr old and the majority of stars at negative longitudes to be 14 gyr , with a roughly equal mixture of both at longitudes near @xmath9@xmath20 .",
    "however , this is excluded by the age data of zoccali et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , at ( @xmath9,@xmath10)=(0.3,@xmath116.2 ) , and clarkson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) at ( @xmath9,@xmath10)=(1.3,@xmath112.7 ) .",
    "both studies find an old bulge @xmath3810 gyr with almost no trace of a younger population . again",
    ", this would not explain how two vastly different age stellar populations could be maintained on opposite sides of the galactic center .",
    "we conclude that it is not possible to account for the observed k - band rc magnitudes with two stellar populations of different ages at a single distance .",
    "thus , we attribute the observed differences in rc magnitude as primarily a distance effect .",
    "we note the similarity of our bulge - wide double rc to the double rc in the bulge globular cluster terzan  5 , found by ferraro et al .",
    "it is tantalizing that the galactic longitude of terzan  5 puts it very close to the peak of our bright rc ( but closer to the plane than our fields ) , and that ferraro et al.s preferred terzan  5 distance , at 5.9@xmath50.5 kpc , is very similar to our estimated distance for the bright rc , at 6.5 @xmath50.2 kpc .",
    "ferraro et al . ( 2009 ) fit the rc region using two isochrones , one at 12 gyr with [ fe / h]=@xmath110.2 dex , and a brighter one with an age of 6 gyr and [ fe / h]=@xmath390.3 dex .",
    "the young population is critical for explaining the terzan  5 double rc .",
    "if this explanation were true for the bulge - wide double rc found here it might indicate that the bright rc is due to a huge accreted stellar system .    while a second , young , metal - rich , population is acceptable for an individual globular cluster , it is in conflict with the distribution of _ cmd _ ages found by zoccali et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and clarkson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who find almost no trace of bulge stars with ages less than 10  gyr .",
    "the zoccali et al .",
    "( 2003 ) field is closest to our fields near @xmath40=@xmath41 , which shows a large fraction of bright and faint rc star populations .",
    "thus , for double rcs due to age and metallicity , rather than distance , there should be large numbers of both young and old populations in the zoccali et al .",
    "( 2003 ) field ; yet no significant 6  gyr population is evident in the zoccali et al .",
    "( 2003 ) data .",
    "the two rcs in ter  5 @xmath42 are shifted in mean ( j@xmath11k ) color by @xmath20.15 magnitudes , consistent with the claimed [ fe / h ] difference .",
    "however , for our bulge - wide fields the bright and faint rcs have nearly identical mean colors , no matter what the reddening , suggesting no significant metallicity differences . without a metallicity difference the required ages of the two bulge - wide rc populations , for [ fe / h]@xmath2@xmath110.2 , needs to be 2 and 14 gyrs , as stated above ; such age differences are easily ruled - out . thus , there seems to be no way to appeal to an acceptable combination of age and metallicity to explain the brightness and color of the two bulge - wide double rcs discussed in this paper ; thus , we assume that the double rcs reflect a distance effect .",
    "a caveat is that this conclusion relies on the assumption that the age distribution at @xmath40=@xmath41 is similar to the old ages in the @xmath43 field of zoccali et al .",

    "[ fig - lon ] we show some of these regions for latitude @xmath46 , with longitudes ranging from @xmath47@xmath12 to @xmath48@xmath12 .",
    "the mean reddening of each field was estimated from the mean 2mass ( j@xmath11k ) color of the red clump . here",
    "we adopt an unreddened 2mass ( j@xmath11k)@xmath36=0.61 for the @xmath118@xmath1 bulge red clump , based on the alves ( 2000 ) mean cit v@xmath11k=2.35 for solar neighborhood rc stars , the alonso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) color - t@xmath49 relations and the cit2mass color transformations of carpenter ( 2005 unpublished ) .",
    "the mean metallicity of the alves ( 2000 ) solar neighborhood rc stars is similar to the mean metallicity of the @xmath118@xmath1 bulge field , at [ fe / h]=@xmath110.18 dex , based on a linear metallicity gradient computed with the metallicities of nearby fields from zoccali et al .",
    "thus , the alves ( 2000 ) rc calibration has the appropriate metallicity for this bulge field , and roughly the right t@xmath49 and ( j@xmath11k ) color , although because the bulge is significantly older the luminosity of the solar neighborhood rc stars is different .",
    "note that because the rc ( j@xmath11k ) colors show a small metallicity sensitivity our reddening values are close , but not strictly correct , for bulge fields with different mean metallicities . in our analysis",
    "we employ the winkler ( 1997 ) reddening law , from which we find a@xmath35=0.64 e(j@xmath11k ) .",
    "we note that nishiyama et al ( 2009 ) find a slightly different reddening law for the bulge , for which they obtain a@xmath35=0.528 e(j@xmath11k ) . our k - band extinction correction for ( @xmath9,@xmath10)=(@xmath111,@xmath118 ) at 0.10 mag .",
    "would be reduced to 0.08 mag .",
    "if we employed the nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reddening law .",
    "because these values are very small , being less than the bin width in the luminosity functions presented here , the choice of reddening law does not affect our conclusions .",
    "we prefer to use the ( j@xmath11k ) color difference to estimate the average reddening and k - band extinction for each field rather than the ( h@xmath11k ) color because the bulge rc ( h@xmath11k ) color , in our fields , suffers significant overlap with foreground disk main sequence and rc stars .",
    "we do not attempt to correct for extinction of individual rc stars using the reddening - free k@xmath50 magnitudes employed by nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , because this introduces unacceptable errors for our fields .",
    "the formula used by nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2005 ) effectively adopts reddening values for each star based on the h@xmath11k color distance from the mean rc value . however , the rc is not a discrete point , but has an intrinsic color width even for single populations ; in 47  tuc the rc has a 2mass color width of 0.10 magnitudes in ( j@xmath11k ) and 0.13 magnitudes in ( h@xmath11k ) . because the bulge contains stars with a range of metallicity",
    "the intrinsic width of the rc is even larger than in 47  tuc .",
    "for this reason , distance from the mean rc color is a poor reddening indicator in the low - extinction bulge fields considered here . if we employ k@xmath50 from nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2005 ) our bulge luminosity functions would effectively be convolved with an error distribution and the peaks more difficult to identify .    because the k - band extinctions of our fields are small , typically less than 0.10 magnitudes , it is more reliable to simply correct for the average extinction for each field , implied from the mean rc ( j@xmath11k ) color , than to employ the putative reddening - free k@xmath50 magnitudes for individual stars . because of the metallicity - dependence of the rc ( j@xmath11k ) and m@xmath35 values our adopted mean extinctions and implied distances are sensitive to systematic metallicity differences between fields .    in figure  [ fig - lon ]",

    "however , we expect that the signal will be diluted by contamination from foreground / background rgb stars in the faint / bright rc samples .    thus , while the v07 mean longitudinal proper motion differences between the two rc populations are not consistent with distance separation , both the mean proper motion and the proper motion dispersion in the latitude direction are consistent with the faint rc at a significantly greater distance .",
    "two radial velocity studies of the galactic bulge have been undertaken recently : the extensive brava fiber survey ( howard et al . 2008 , 2009 ) of bright bulge giants , and a fabry - perot investigation of bulge giants and rc stars by rangwala , williams & stanek ( 2009 , henceforth rws09 ) .",
    "the two studies show consistent mean velocities and velocity dispersions in the overlap regions .",
    "the brava study is quite extensive , covering a range of 20@xmath1 in longitude , at latitudes of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the resultant brava velocities are consistent with cylindrical rotation with a peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath2150 km / s for fields at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , or a maximum velocity of @xmath275 km / s .",
    "howard et al . ( 2008 , 2009 ) conclude that this is consistent with a pseudo - bulge , but not a classical bulge .",
    "shen et al . ( 2010 ) model the brava velocities and find a pure bar morphology with no trace of a classical bulge .",
    "because the brava survey did not reach the faint rc , it contains no information on the bright versus faint rc kinematics .",
    "a very important point is that both the brava and the rws09 velocities are consistent with orbital motion , showing the expected change in sign where stars at positive longitudes , near @xmath54 , are foreground , but background near @xmath101 .",
    "this strongly confirms our assumption that the fields near these longitudes are separated in distance , rather than at the same distance with differing rc magnitudes , due to unspecified population effects .",
    "one might ask how the brava velocity - longitude plots can appear continuous and symmetric when it samples stars on opposite sides of the galactic center that are asymmetrically distributed in longitude .",
    "the answer is that for a line of sight through a circular orbit the foreground and background have the same radial velocity , but opposite proper motions .",
    "the symmetry of the brava velocities with longitude indicates that the foreground and background populations are equally distant from the center of rotation .",
    "in addition to the overall velocity field rsw09 also dissected the rc into bright and faint components .",
    "they found bright minus faint rc velocity differences in their @xmath102 fields of @xmath1135@xmath511 km / s , which they attributed to non - circular streaming motions .",
    "closer to the minor axis , at @xmath103 , rsw09 found no velocity differences between the two rc populations .",
    "the velocity difference at @xmath55@xmath1 might be understood as the signature of off - center bar rotation , with the axis of rotation closer to the background rc population ; however , this possibility appears to be ruled - out by the symmetry of the brava velocities .",
    "rws09 noted that this velocity difference is opposite to the predictions of mao & paczyski ( 2002 ) : faint rc stars have more positive velocities , not the expected more negative values .",
    "thus , the bright / faint rc velocity differences of rws09 must be investigated further .",
    "although many metallicity studies of the galactic bulge have been undertaken , only rangwala & williams ( 2009 , henceforth rw09 ) have compared [ fe / h ] values from bright and faint rc stars .",
    "rw09 measured metallicities from the 8542  ca - triplet line in their earlier fabry - perot data .",
    "based on a calibration with high resolution [ fe / h ] values they inferred a mean [ fe / h ] for the field at @xmath104 of @xmath110.55@xmath50.03 dex , and @xmath110.17@xmath50.03 dex for the @xmath101 field .",
    "this metallicity difference suggests that the bright and faint rc are distinctly different populations .",
    "however , such a longitudinal , lop - sided , metallicity difference is very difficult to understand for most morphologies ; if correct , accretion of a dwarf galaxy seems plausible .    because a lop - sided metallicity trend would have significant implications for our understanding of the bulge ,",
    "independent verification of this result is critical .",
    "the presence of stars in the rw09 sample with reported [ fe / h ] up to @xmath393 dex gives cause for concern that large systematic uncertainties may be present .",
    "andreas koch ( 2010 , private communication ) has made provisional metallicity measurements from the brava spectra ; he found no significant asymmetry with longitude , contradicting the unusual metallicities of rw09 .",
    "we , therefore , significantly downgrade the weight given to the metallicity asymmetry claimed by rw09 .",
    "from 2mass k@xmath36 , ( j@xmath11k)@xmath36 color - magnitude diagrams we found two distinct rc populations towards the galactic bulge , separated by @xmath37k@xmath36@xmath20.65 magnitudes at latitude @xmath52 , and co - existing in fields over 13@xmath1 in longitude and 20@xmath1 in latitude .",
    "the presence of the two rc populations is particularly obvious at a galactic latitude of @xmath118@xmath1 .",
    "we detect the individual rc populations over a @xmath220@xmath10520@xmath1 area of sky , roughly symmetric about the galactic center .",
    "thus , the two populations cover essentially the entire galactic bulge / bar region ; however , the 2mass data do not probe the rc within @xmath25@xmath1 of the galactic plane , due to confusion limitations .",
    "we also find that the faint rc is dominant on the negative longitude side of the galactic center , while the bright rc is the principal population at positive longitudes .",
    "based on the age and metallicity sensitivity of the rc , predicted by theoretical stellar isochrones of the teramo group ( pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 ) , we find that the two rcs can not be due to any allowed combination of age or [ fe / h ] in the galactic bulge / bar at a single distance .",
    "number statistics firmly rule - out the possibility that the two luminosity peaks are due to rc plus red giant branch bump ( rgb bump ) or asymptotic giant branch bump ( agb bump ) .",
    "heretofore unknown stellar evolution effects are also militated against , due to the change in number ratio between positive and negative longitude sides of the galactic bulge .",
    "the obvious , and natural , explanation is that the faint and bright rc peaks reflect different distances of two populations . at ( @xmath3)=(@xmath4 )",
    "we estimate distances of 6.5 and 8.8@xmath106 kpc for the two rcs , based on m@xmath35=@xmath111.44 , computed with theoretical offsets from the observed 47  tuc k - band absolute magnitude , and assuming an age of 12 gyr and a mean [ fe / h]=@xmath110.18 dex .",
    "figure  [ distdot-8 ] and [ fig - x ] should be consulted for distances at other locations .",
    "we note that these distances are based on the assumption of a bulge age equal to that of 47  tuc , near 12 gyr ; our estimated distances increase for younger bulge ages .    radial velocity data , particularly from the brava survey ( howard et al . 2008 , 2009 ) , are consistent with the faint rc population being more distant than the bright rc population .",
    "proper motion results from sumi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and v07 are also generally consistent with a distance interpretation .",
    "an immediate conclusion is that these two co - existing populations are not consistent with the body of a bar , since the line of sight through a bar should occur at one distance , not two .",
    "other evidence against these populations being in the body of a bar is the fact that both populations mostly exist at fixed distances , independent of longitude ; in particular , the foreground rc peak k@xmath36 magnitude is unchanged over 9@xmath1 in longitude .",
    "this is in stark contrast to a bar , which other studies have claimed is pointed almost directly towards us , tilted by only @xmath220@xmath1 to the line of sight . for a bar tilted at 20@xmath1 the distance change over 9@xmath1 in longitude",
    "is expected to exceed 2kpc , or roughly 0.7 magnitudes .    when we plot distance of the peaks versus longitude for latitude @xmath52 , and add approximate number counts , we find that the faint and bright rc counts peak near longitudes @xmath107 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "a line joining these two maxima is tilted , approximately 20@xmath1 to the line of sight and crosses the @xmath70 line within 1@xmath71 of the distance to the galactic center , projected onto the @xmath52 plane ; this intersection point is roughly midway between the foreground and background populations .    as a function of latitude",
    "our luminosity plots show that the two rc peaks are closer in distance at lower galactic latitudes ( i.e. , toward the plane ) , mostly because of an increase in brightness of the background rc .",
    "the two rcs appear to merge around @xmath108 .",
    "when we make a crude correction to the rc m@xmath35 for the metallicity gradient with latitude along the minor axis , by zoccali et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we found that a vertical cut through the bulge / bar , at @xmath103 ( from @xmath109 to @xmath110 , i.e. , as viewed from the side ) shows an x - shaped morphology .",
    "the center of the x - shape occurs near 7.3@xmath50.3 kpc , which is equal to , within the uncertainties , the galactic center distance of ghez et al ( 2008 ) , at 8.0@xmath50.6 kpc .",
    "better agreement between these two centers would be obtained if the bulge is @xmath223 gyr younger than 47  tuc , or if the metallicity difference between bulge and 47 tuc rc stars is larger than we assume , or if there is an unspecified systematic error in the theoretical isochrones .",
    "the rc peak counts above the troughs in the double peaked rc luminosity functions gave a minimum estimate for the fraction of stars in the x versus stars in a broader rc distribution , perhaps from a bar or spheroidal component .",
    "this is a minimum because it is possible that the troughs are partly , or entirely , due to the overlapping wings of the distributions of the foreground / background rc components .",
    "we found that at ( @xmath3)=(@xmath4 ) the foreground / background rc x components are at least 20% of the total rc population ; at ( @xmath3)=(@xmath111 ) the foreground / background x - components must be close to 100% of the total rc ; on the other hand , near @xmath112 the estimated fraction due to foreground / background components ranges from almost negligible to 100% of the population .",
    "our analysis of the 2mass data contains no compelling direct evidence of a galactic bar , although one may be present in a smooth rc population between the rc peaks . as noted above , at ( @xmath3)=(@xmath111 ) , the 2mass data show no room for a bar .",
    "detailed modelling will be required to constrain a bar population in this data .",
    "it seems reasonable , however , that the x - shape may merge into a short bar at latitudes below @xmath113 .",
    "we note that the radial velocity data of the brava survey shows an increased dispersion near @xmath114 , as expected from a bar .",
    "detailed models of these radial velocities by shen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) provide excellent fits with a pure bar structure ; they found that a spheroidal component can be no more than 8% of the total .",
    "our finding that at least 20% of rc stars are in the x - shape component at @xmath52 , rather than a bar , may be in conflict with the 8% limit of shen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ; however , their limit refers to a spherical distribution , rather than arcs at the ends of a bar , so it is possible that no conflict exists .",
    "a reasonable , qualitative , model to explain the observations presented here is that the high - latitude bulge ( above @xmath1156@xmath1 ) is dominated by the vertical extent of stars near the foreground and background ends of a galactic bar . in this scenario stars extend in all directions from the ends of the bar , i.e. , in both longitude and latitude . in",
    "longitude the stars occupy arcs , or partial orbits , emanating from the bar ends . for this reason , a line connecting the peaks in the foreground/ background rc populations trace the direction of the bar , tilted at @xmath220@xmath1 to the line of sight , assuming that there is no significant rotational lag .",
    "the axis of rotation of the bar is marked by the point where this line intersects with @xmath70 . in figure  [ fig - x ] this point is located at 7.7 kpc from the sun ; it happens to lie roughly midway between the two rcs and within 1@xmath71 of the galactic center distance .",
    "this arrangement should produce symmetry in the mean radial velocity curve , similar to the brava observations .",
    "because the bar is almost end - on , the stars in the arcs , near the bar ends , spread almost tangentially to the line of sight , and thus appear at a nearly constant distance , as observed .",
    "however , at large angular distance , in longitude , from the bar ends , the stars along the arcs / orbits are closer to the galactic center distance , also observed .",
    "since stars emanating from the bar ends do so in all directions , they appear as two roughly circular areas , and take - on a peanut appearance when viewed nearly end - on to the bar ; a slight flattening of the peanut may be expected due to the gravitational potential in the latitude direction .",
    "when viewed from the side , the structure takes on an x - shape morphology , as the stars emanating from the bar ends merge into the bar . in this case the main component of the bar resides at low galactic latitudes , and perhaps for this reason the end components are relatively easy to detect at high latitude .",
    "an alternative description is that there is only an x - shaped component which extends to high latitudes , but without connecting to a bar .",
    "as before , since we are looking almost end - on to the axis of the x , the foreground and background appear at nearly constant distances .",
    "another , alternative , explanation of the observed two rc components is that we have detected concentrations in the thick disk near the ends of the bar .",
    "if correct , this scenario might naturally explain the similarity of the composition of thick disk and bulge red giant stars found by alves - brito et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "if our two populations represent extensions from the ends of a bar , then their velocities should show cylindrical rotation , similar to bar models , but with a distribution not considered by shen et al .",
    "one major difficulty is that our results suggest a end - to - end bar length of @xmath22.5 kpc , whereas the best fit model of shen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) indicates a bar half - length of 4kpc .",
    "x - shape , boxy , and peanut morphologies of extra - galactic bulges are well known phenomena , e.g. , ic 4767 , ngc 128 , ngc 4469 , ic 2531 ( e.g. , whitmore & bell 1988 ; bureau et al . 2006 . )",
    "the x - shapes are relatively minor components of extra - galactic bulges , and significant image processing is usually required to highlight them , in stark contrast to the strong signal we find here for the galaxy .",
    "n - body simulations of isolated disk galaxies and the growth of bars ( e.g. , patsis et al .",
    "2002 ; athanassoula 2005 ) find x - shape morphologies resulting from bar growth . in particular , the * x1v1 * resonance mode of patsis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) appears very similar to our results for the galaxy .",
    "if these predictions are correct , the implication is that the bulge x - shape resulted from bar instabilities , and that the galaxy contains a pseudo - bulge , and a bar , rather than a classical bulge .",
    "x - morphologies also result from mergers , although bars are still involved : mihos et al .",
    "( 1995 ) performed numerical simulations of satellite accretion by s0 galaxies , and found that prograde accretion induced the formation of bars , which subsequently buckled and produced x structures .",
    "since the formation of a bar from an isolated disk galaxy relies on interactions between its disk and halo , the overlap between these two mechanisms is greater than at first apparent .",
    "typical timescales for pseudo - bulge growth is @xmath21 gyr ( e.g. , athanassoula 2008 ) , which may be problematic for a rapid formation timescale for the galactic bulge ( e.g. , ballero et al .",
    "2007 ) , as implied by the enhanced [ mg / fe ] ratios ( e.g. , fulbright et al . 2007 ; lecureur et al . 2007",
    "; mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) ; although , both the timescale and the mg enhancements have associated uncertainties which may bring them into rough agreement .",
    "another difficulty is that pseudo - bulges / bars are thought to result in well mixed orbits , such that metallicity gradients may not be expected ( zoccali 2010 ; howard et al . 2009 . )",
    "however , the bulge metallicity gradient is well - known ( zoccali et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the metallicities correlate with kinematic properties .",
    "it is possible that the gradient simply results from the super - position of two populations ( zoccali et al .",
    "2010 ; babusiaux et al . 2010 ; hill et al .",
    "howard et al .",
    "( 2009 ) speculated that dissipative processes during bar formation might explain the metallicity gradient .    while an x - shape bulge qualitatively explains the 2mass photometry and much of the published kinematic data , some literature results are problematic .",
    "the @xmath1135 km / s radial velocity difference between bright and faint rc found by rws09 is difficult to understand ; asymmetric bar rotation could explain it , but such an asymmetry in velocities is not obvious in the brava data .",
    "also , the 0.4 dex difference in [ fe / h ] between @xmath116 and @xmath117 bulge components , found by rw09 , suggests an accreted system , rather than a bar or symmetric x - component ; however , provisional metallicities from the brava spectra , by koch ( 2010 , private communication ) do not support an [ fe / h ] asymmetry .",
    "perhaps the most important difficulty is that the x - shape is evident in our 2mass data when the dependence of mean [ fe / h ] on galactic latitude is taken into account , without the metallicity corrections the morphology is more k - shaped .",
    "this is a problem because the expectation is that the bar should not possess a metallicity gradient , and while x - morphologies are well known in external galaxies , we are unaware of k - morphologies .",
    "the final piece of confusing evidence is the lack of difference between the mean proper motions of bright and faint rc stars in the data of vieira et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "these apparent inconsistencies demand that future work on the kinematics and composition of rc bulge stars be pursued for a more complete picture of the galactic bulge region .",
    "it is particularly important to verify whether there is a metallicity gradient with latitude in the rc x - populations ; if so , this would support the idea of howard et al ( 2009 ) , that the bar formed with dissipation ; if not , then the bulge is k - shaped .",
    "if the gradient simply reflects a changing ratio between two populations with different mean [ fe / h ] , then composition studies of these two populations would be interesting and useful .",
    "a definitive investigation of the possible metallicity asymmetry with longitude proposed by rangwala & williams ( 2009 ) is also necessary .",
    "extant age studies by zoccali et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and clarkson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) should be supplemented with a photometric survey for the ages of bulge stars at @xmath40=@xmath118 , in order to completely rule - out the possibility that age is responsible for the luminosity difference between the two rcs at this latitude .",
    "other important future work includes detailed modelling of the 2mass data , in order to determine the relative proportions of a bar and the foreground / background rc components .",
    "a high spatial resolution infrared photometric survey , such as the vista variable in the va lctea survey ( vvv , minniti et al .",
    "2010 ) , covering roughly the same longitudinal extent as the current work , but going to much smaller latitudes will help to determine whether the x - shape continues to the galactic center , or joins the bar .",
    "analysis of the premilinary vvv catalogues is ongoing ( saito et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "independent verification of the foreground / background distances , at high latitude , with standard candles , such as miras , strong - lined rr lyrae stars , and eclipsing binaries , will also be very helpful .",
    "after this paper was submitted for publication nataf et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reported a split rc toward the galactic bulge .",
    "their findings are broadly consistent with the results of this paper ; in particular , they find very nearly equal ( v@xmath11i ) colors , consistent with similar metallicity for the two rc components .",
