    "the mechanism of diffusive particle acceleration at shock fronts is one of the best studied acceleration processes possibly at work in a wide variety of astrophysical environments . after the pioneering work carried out in the 70 s and early 80 s on non - relativistic shock fronts @xcite and slightly later on the extension of the acceleration process to the case of relativistic shocks @xcite numerous developments took place mainly driven by three scientific goals : 1 ) relax the assumption of _ test particles _ , therefore introducing the possibility of shock modification due to the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles on the shock itself ( see @xcite for a recent review ) ; 2 ) introduction of self - generation of scattering as a result of streaming instability ; 3 ) set the bases for a general theory that could be applied to shocks with arbitrary speed .    from the phenomenological point of view these efforts",
    "are motivated by the wealth of situations in which the acceleration process can potentially be at work , from the case of supernova remnants ( snrs ) to that of gamma ray bursts and more in general to the case of relativistic jetted plasma ejections from compact objects .",
    "the case of snrs is especially relevant for its potential implications for the origin of galactic cosmic rays .    the point 1 ) above",
    "has received much attention : the problem of dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles has been faced by using two - fluid models @xcite , kinetic models @xcite and numerical approaches , both monte carlo and other simulation procedures @xcite .",
    "all these approaches are however limited to non - relativistic shocks .",
    "the only case that we are aware of in which shock modification has been calculated for a relativistic shock is the numerical simulation of @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite have presented an semi - analytical solution of the combined problem of particle acceleration at modified shocks with self - generated alfven waves ( point 2 ) , though treating the wave amplification in the context of quasi - linear theory .    the point 3 ) above , namely the construction of a unified description of the acceleration process applicable to any shock , has been successfully solved , in the framework of a test particle approach , by @xcite , and applied to some cases of interest by @xcite .",
    "@xcite illustrated a wide variety of comparisons of the theory with existing work in both cases of non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic shocks .",
    "in the latter case , much work has been done by several authors , who used numerical methods @xcite or semi - analytical approaches @xcite , though limited to specific situations ( for instance small pitch angle scattering ) .",
    "this paper is the third of a series , in which the original calculations of @xcite are applied to investigate cases that can be of some phenomenological relevance .",
    "here we determine the changes to the spectral index of the accelerated particles , taking into account the possibility that different physical situations may change the equation of state of the plasma downstream of the shock .",
    "in particular collective plasma effects in the proximity of a collisionless shock may be responsible for different levels of thermalization of the electron and proton gas components behind the shock .",
    "these effects are expected to provide a channel of energy transfer from protons to electrons ( see for example @xcite ) though not through particle - particle collisions .",
    "other collective processes might result in the generation of a downstream turbolent magnetic field , which in turn may change the equation of state of the downstream fluid .",
    "we describe these effects in a phenomenological way , by introducing a parametrization of the energy exchange between electrons , protons and magnetic field energy densities in the downstream plasma , and we use such parametrization to infer the changes in the equation of state and the spectral slope of the particles accelerated at the shock front .    the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : jump ] we describe the jump conditions for a strong shock moving with arbitrary speed . in  [ sec : state ] we obtain the equation of state for the downstream plasma for different cases of interest .",
    "we present our results on the spectrum of accelerated particles in  [ sec : spectrum ] and conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the jump conditions describing the conservation of mass , momentum and energy across a shock front moving with velocity @xmath1 in a medium with density @xmath2 , pressure @xmath3 and energy density @xmath4 are as follows ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) : @xmath5 number densities ( @xmath6 ) , pressures ( @xmath7 ) and energy densities ( @xmath8 ) are all measured in the comoving frame of the plasma they refer to , while the lorentz factor @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) of the upstream ( downstream ) plasma are measured in the shock frame ( clearly @xmath11 ) .",
    "the indexes ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' refer to the upstream and downstream plasmas respectively .    the equations above can be easily generalized to the case of presence of non negligible magnetic fields upstream , but in the following we shall assume that the dynamical role of such fields is always fully negligible , and shall therefore ignore the corrections in the conservation equations .",

    "it is also easy to determine the velocity jump and the shock @xmath26 , which is a crucial parameter for the description of the process of particle acceleration at the shock front .",
    "in this section we consider several instances of equations of state for the downstream gas , in addition to the well known and widely used synge equation of state @xcite . in  [ sez3.1 ]",
    "we discuss the case of a downstream plasma made of two independent particle species that may thermalize to different temperatures . in  [ sez3.2 ] we introduce the possibility that the the proton and electron components are coupled in a collisionless way . in  [ sez3.3 ] we discuss the modification of the equation of state due to generation of a turbulent magnetic field in the downstream plasma . finally in  [ sez3.4 ] we make an attempt to consider the most general case in which all the effects described above are taken into account .",
    "an equation of state which is widely used in the literature was introduced by @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption is that the plasma consists of a single component with temperature @xmath27 , and @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the modified bessel functions . for @xmath32 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath33 ) eq .",

    "( [ sez3eq_synge_single ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the normalized variables introduced in the previous section : @xmath39 which has the functional form assumed in  [ sec : state ] with @xmath40 .",
    "the synge equation of state describes correctly the behaviour of the plasma in the ultra - relativistic and newtonian limits : applying the procedure illustrated in  [ sec : jump ] we easily find the velocity jump @xmath41 , which is plotted as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ sez3fig_eq_stato_p+e ] , as a function of the product @xmath42 . in the case of strong newtonian shocks",
    "the well known result @xmath43 is recovered . in the limit of an ultra - relativistic shock , when the downstream fluid obeys the ultra - relativistic equation of state for the gas , @xmath44 .",
    "the generalization of the synge equation of state to the case of two ( or more ) independent particle species with temperatures @xmath45 is rather straightforward .",
    "of particular interest is the case in which the temperature of the @xmath46th species is simply due to the isotropization of the velocity vectors at the shock surface . in this case",
    "the energy density of the @xmath46th species in the downstream plasma can be written as @xmath47 , or , in terms of dimensionless variables : @xmath48 independent of the type of particles . since the normalized energy density is the same for all species , the normalized pressures need to be the same too .",
    "it follows immediately that for the system as a whole one can write : @xmath49 where the total quantities have the subscript @xmath50 .",
    "the formation of collisionless shocks , both in the relativistic and newtonian regime still represents a subject of active investigation , in that the mechanisms that allow for an efficient transport of information among the particles in the plasma through the exchange of mhd waves are poorly known . on the other hand we know that such shocks do exist , which can be interpreted as an indirect proof of the importance of collective effects in collisionless plasmas .",
    "the same type of effects may also be responsible for total or partial thermalization of the different components of a plasma . whether electrons and protons downstream of the shock front are in thermal equilibrium or not is a matter of debate .",
    "most likely the answer depends on the specific conditions behind the shock of interest .",
    "in addition to the thermalization of the species , there are several other problems related to our ignorance of the complex physics that rules these effects : for instance even the spectrum of the _ thermal _ distribution of protons ( and respectively of electrons ) may not be a typical maxwellian , in particular if a background magnetic field makes the distribution of energy in the waves anisotropic . in these conditions",
    "one should probably introduce a plasma temperature along the field and perpendicular to it .",
    "the problem of the thermalization of the plasmas around collisionless shocks is also related to the issue of the _ thickness _ of a collisionless shock , which is usually assumed to be of the order of the gyration radius of the thermal proton component .",
    "the same collective effects also determine the efficiency of injection of particles in the acceleration cycle : it appears intuitively clear that in a collisionless shock the processes of thermalization and particle acceleration to non - thermal energies are intimately related to each other .    lacking a true theory of collisionless energy transport",
    ", we adopt here a phenomenological approach in that we parametrize the degree of equilibration between electron and proton temperatures in the downstream region by introducing a parameter @xmath51 , such that the temperatures of electrons and protons satisfy the relation @xmath52 . on very general grounds we expect @xmath53 , at least close to the shock , before any collisional effects may possibly equilibrate the two temperatures where the plasma has moved away from the shock front .",
    "if we assume that the electron and proton gas separately behave as perfect fluids , the pressures of the two components are related through @xmath54 .",
    "the equations of state of electrons and protons are easily found to be    @xmath55    here all the normalized quantities refer to the total matter density , namely @xmath56 . in order to solve the equations for the jump conditions at the shock surface",
    "we also need the total normalized energy densities and pressures :    @xmath57    we found the appropriate solutions for the jump conditions for several values of the parameter @xmath51 in the range @xmath58 .",
    "[ sez3fig_eq_stato_p+e ] shows the velocity ratio @xmath41 as a function of the product @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the case considered in section [ sez3.1 ] corresponds to @xmath62 , while @xmath63 represents the limit case with protons and electrons thermalized at the same temperature .",
    "the most peculiar feature of the curves plotted in fig . [ sez3fig_eq_stato_p+e ] is the presence of a peak approximately at the place where the shock becomes trans - relativistic .",
    "the nature of this peak and the phenomenological implications of its presence are rather interesting . in order to understand the origin of the peak we consider the unphysical case @xmath64 , which corresponds to completely cold ions in the downstream plasma .",
    "for all curves in fig .",
    "[ sez3fig_eq_stato_p+e ] we can clearly identify three regimes : 1 ) both electrons and protons downstream are non - relativistic ; 2 ) electrons are relativistic while protons are still non - relativistic ; 3 ) both electrons and protons are relativistic .",
    "the case @xmath65 ( or equivalently @xmath66 ) is the case that is usually studied in the literature . in the limit of",
    "non relativistic strong shocks this case leads to compression factor that asymptotically approaches 4 .",
    "the derivative of the compression factor with respect to @xmath67 in this non relativistic regime is zero , as can be shown by using the taub conditions eqs .",

    "moreover the asymptotic value of @xmath41 for ultra - relativistic shocks is always @xmath71 .",
    "this implies that at some point in between the compression factor has a peak where the derivative is zero and the compression factor is maximum .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",

    "the spectrum of the accelerated particles is however rather sensitive to the structure of the turbulent field in the downstream fluid . as we discussed in sec .",

    "we used the theoretical framework introduced by @xcite and @xcite to determine the spectrum of particles accelerated at shocks with arbitrary speed and scattering properties , with different equations of state of the gas downstream .",
    "in particular we investigated two situations : 1 ) the downstream gas is made of thermal electrons and protons that may exchange energy with each other , thereby changing the equation of state ; 2 ) the downstream gas includes a turbulent magnetic field .",
    "we also considered the case in which both effects are at work at the same time .    in the downstream frame",
    "the scattering has always been assumed to be in the spas regime , while in the upstream fluid we considered two scenarios , namely spas and regular field with no turbulent scattering .",
    "we limited our attention to the case of strong shocks , namely the case in which the inflowing plasma has zero pressure .      when the downstream plasma is made of electrons and protons and their temperatures are different , for newtonian and ultra - relativistic shocks the shape of the spectrum is not appreciably changed .",

    "we identified two situations of interest that arise when the magnetic field is introduced in the conservation equations at the shock surface : 1 ) the turbulent field is created downstream and is isotropic ; 2 ) the magnetic field downstream is the result of the compression of the turbulent field upstream ( only the perpendicular components are compressed ) . in the former case it can be demonstrated that the equation of state of the magnetic field is identical to that of an ideal relativistic gas , eq .",

    "the important effect consisting of a spectral steepening was found by @xcite and was attributed to the fact that the compression in the downstream gas makes the magnetic field quasi - perpendicular , thereby reducing significantly the probability of return from the downstream frame .",
    "this effect is limited , in the analysis of @xcite to the particles with gyration radius smaller than the coherence scale of the turbulent field .",
    "the steepening of the spectrum as found in our calculations , is due to a change in the equation of state of the downstream plasma ( electrons , protons and magnetic field ) and concerns all of the spectrum of the accelerated particles .",
    "the relevance of this finding for the phenomenology of several astrophysical sources of accelerated particles , in particular those where a relativistic shock is expected or observed , is evident ."
