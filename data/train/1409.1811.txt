    "a major impediment that prevents pressurized water reactors ( pwrs ) from operating at higher duty and longer cycles is the accumulation of boron within metal oxide scales that deposit on the upper spans of fuel assemblies .",
    "boron , in the form of boric acid ( h@xmath2bo@xmath2 ) , is added to pwr coolant to control the neutron flux while lithium hydroxide ( lioh ) is also dosed to control the acidity of the coolant and to reduce corrosion . because of the large neutron absorption cross section of @xmath3b , a small amount of accumulated b is sufficient to cause an abnormal decrease in the neutron flux , which shifts the power output toward the bottom half of the reactor core .",
    "this phenomenon , known as axial offset anomaly ( aoa ) , has been observed in high - duty reactors that run long fuel - cycles . in extreme form , aoa can decrease the reactor shutdown margin sufficiently to force major power reduction leading to substantial economic losses  @xcite .",
    "aoa modeling efforts traditionally assume that boron deposition within the metal oxide scales ( which are commonly referred to as crud , an acronym for chalk river unidentified deposits ) occurs predominantly through precipitation of lithium borate compounds such as libo@xmath0 , li@xmath0bo@xmath4 , li@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "although the retrograde solubility of these borates could explain the `` lithium return '' experienced during plant shutdown , they have never been observed experimentally in pwr crud .",
    "using mssbauer spectroscopy together with xrd on crud scrapes recovered from high duty pwrs , sawicki identified the precipitation of ni@xmath0febo@xmath5 as a possible mechanism for b deposition  @xcite .",
    "mesoscale crud models developed by short _",
    "_ , assume that supersaturation of boric acid leads to precipitation of boron trioxide ( b@xmath0o@xmath2 ) within the crud  @xcite .    in recent work",
    ", we combined _ ab initio _ calculations with experimental formation enthalpies to investigate the incorporation of b into the structure of nickel ferrite ( nife@xmath0o@xmath1 , nfo ) as a potential new mechanism for b deposition within crud  @xcite . assuming solid - solid ( and solid - gas ) equilibrium between nickel ferrite and elemental reservoirs of fe , ni ,",
    "b ( and o@xmath0 gas ) we found that it is thermodynamically favorable for b to form secondary phases with fe , ni , and o ( _ e . g. _",
    "b@xmath0o@xmath2 , fe@xmath2bo@xmath5 , and ni@xmath2b@xmath0o@xmath6 ) instead of entering the nfo structure as a point defect .",
    "building on previous works  @xcite , the present study attempts to deal with the same question , however , here the defect formation energies are evaluated assuming solid - liquid equilibrium between nfo and the surrounding aqueous solution of ni , fe and dissolved boric acid ( h@xmath2bo@xmath2 ) . to set up solid - liquid equilibrium ,",
    "the chemical potentials of individual aqueous species are defined as a function of temperature , pressure , and concentration and are linked to the chemical potentials of the ionic species in solid .",
    "this new scheme allows for the evaluation of defect formation energies under conditions that are specific to operating nuclear pwrs .",
    "the approach is quite general and applicable to a large variety of solids in equilibrium with aqueous solutions .",
    "the first - principles calculations required for the present study have been carried out within the density functional theory ( dft ) using the same computational parameters and crystal models that are specified in ref .  .",
    "the formation of a defect in a crystalline solid can be regarded as an exchange of particles ( atoms and electrons ) between the host material and chemical reservoirs .",
    "the formation energy of a defect _",
    "d _ in charge state _",
    "q _ can be written as  @xcite    @xmath7    in eq .",
    ", @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the total energies of the defect - containing and defect free solids , calculated within the dft .",
    "the third term on the right side of eq . represents the change in energy due to the exchange of atoms between the host compound and the chemical reservoir , where @xmath10 is the atomic chemical potential of the constituent _ i _ ( _ i _ = ni , fe , or b ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 represents the number of atoms added to @xmath12 or removed from @xmath13 the supercell .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the fermi energy referenced to the energy of the valence band maximum ( vbm ) of the defective supercell , @xmath15 .",
    "this value is calculated as the vbm energy of the pure nfo , corrected by aligning the core potential of atoms far away from the defect in the defect - containing supercell with that in the defect free supercell  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 represents the charge state of the defect , _",
    "i. e. _ the number of electrons exchanged with the electron reservoir with chemical potential @xmath14 .    under solid - liquid equilibrium conditions , the chemical potentials of the ionic species in the solid,@xmath17 , are equal to the chemical potential of the aqueous species in the saturated solution , @xmath18 .",
    "to derive an expression for defect formation energy , eq .",
    "has to be written in terms of ionic chemical potentials , @xmath17 , instead of atomic chemical potentials , @xmath10 .",
    "this can be accomplished by adding and subtracting the term @xmath19 from eq . .",
    "this term can be interpreted as the energy necessary to exchange electrons between the electron reservoir and the atomic species in the pure nfo . if we combine this energy with the atomic chemical potential ( third term in eq . )",
    "we obtain the ionic chemical potential of species in nfo :    @xmath20    in eq .",
    "@xmath21 represents the ionic charge , _ i. e_. the number of electrons exchanged with the electron reservoir to create the ionic species in nfo , and @xmath22 is the energy of the vbm in the pure nfo to which the energy of the electron reservoir @xmath23 is referenced . using eq .",
    "together with the solid - liquid equilibrium condition , @xmath24 , the defect formation energy becomes :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the energy difference between the defect containing and defect free supercells .",
    "therefore , to calculate the defect formation energy , the chemical potentials of the aqueous species have to be evaluated .",
    "the scheme described above has the advantage that it decouples the ionic charge from the charge state of the defect ; charge neutrality is achieved through exchange of electrons with the electron reservoir with energy equal to the fermi level .",
    "the chemical potential of the aqueous ions , @xmath27 , can be written as the sum of the standard chemical potential , @xmath28 , and a temperature dependent term      in eq .  , @xmath30 is the universal gas constant and @xmath31 is the activity of the ionic species @xmath32 in the aqueous solution . in the present case , because nfo is weakly soluble in water , the activity of the ionic species can be approximated by the concentration of ions in the solution .",
    "the gibbs energies of formation required for eq . are obtained from that supcrt database  @xcite which uses the revised helgeson - kirkham - flowers equation of state to predict the thermodynamic behavior of aqueous species at high temperature and pressure  @xcite .",
    "the chemical potentials of the solid phases @xmath37 are usually approximated by the total energy per atom of the elemental solid calculated within the dft framework .",
    "however , as pointed out in earlier work , this approach suffers from incomplete error cancellation when total dft energies of physically and chemically dissimilar systems are compared  @xcite . therefore , to compute the elemental - phase chemical potentials of the fe , ni , b , and o , we extend the database of 50 elemental energies published by stevanovic _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to include b. to do this we add 26 b - containing binaries to the large fitting set of 252 compounds that have been used by stevanovic _",
    "et al . _ and solve the overdetermined system of 278 equations for 51 elements using a least - square approach , as described in refs .  .",
    "the calculated dft energies and experimental formation enthalpies of the 26 b - containing binaries are listed in table  [ table1 ] , while the 51 elemental - phase chemical potentials are given in table  [ table2 ] in the appendix .",
