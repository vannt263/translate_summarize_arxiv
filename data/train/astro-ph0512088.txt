    "neutron stars can be considered as natural laboratories for studying the properties of matter under extreme physical conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in their cores",
    "the density @xmath0 may exceed @xmath1 g @xmath2 and the temperature @xmath3 lies typically between @xmath4 and @xmath5  k , but their thermal emission depends on the properties of the outer envelopes with lower @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "the temperature decreases in the heat - blanketing envelopes ( at @xmath6 g @xmath2 ) to @xmath7 near the radiative surface ( at @xmath8@xmath9 g @xmath2 , depending on the stellar parameters ) , where @xmath10 is the _ effective surface temperature _ related to the thermal flux through the stefan s law . in these envelopes",
    ", the magnetic field strength @xmath11 may reach @xmath1 g ; most often @xmath12 g. to calculate spectra of neutron - star emission that can be compared with the observations , one should take into account nonideality of the plasma in the envelopes and the effects of strong magnetic fields on the properties of the plasma and electromagnetic radiation .    in the cases where @xmath13@xmath9  k ( characteristic of middle - aged neutron stars , i.e. , of age @xmath14@xmath9 yr ) and @xmath15  g , the spectrum of thermal emission from a neutron star forms in an stellar _ atmosphere_. in a strong magnetic field , the state of matter can change significantly ( for review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , at @xmath16  k , an atmosphere composed of hydrogen might be treated as fully ionized if the magnetic field were zero , but there can be a significant fraction of bound h atoms , if @xmath17  g. at lower @xmath3 ( characteristic of older stars ) and sufficiently high @xmath11 , _ magnetic condensation _ may occur , resulting in formation of a solid or liquid metallic surface , composed of a strongly coupled coulomb plasma and covered by a thin gaseous atmosphere .",
    "although the possible importance of these effects has been realized long ago , they were not included in neutron - star atmosphere models until recently ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "early considerations of partial ionization in the magnetized neutron - star atmospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ; also reviewed briefly in @xcite ) were not very reliable because of oversimplified treatments of atomic physics and nonideal plasma effects in strong magnetic fields .",
    "however , in the last decade the studies of dense nonideal plasmas in the strong magnetic fields made a spectacular progress , that now allows one to calculate the spectrum and polarization of electromagnetic radiation formed in an extended partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere or emitted from a condensed metallic surface of a magnetic neutron star .",
    "in this paper , we briefly review these achievements .",
    "motion of electrons and ions in a magnetic field is quantized in the landau orbitals . in neutron - star atmospheres ,",
    "the field is usually _ strongly quantizing _ for the electrons ( see , e.g. , companion paper @xcite for basic definitions ) . when @xmath18  g , the properties of atoms and molecules change drastically @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the center - of - mass motion of an atom is coupled to the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this effect is important for both the equation of state ( eos ) and radiative opacities of the plasma . in this section",
    ", we briefly review these effects for the case of the hydrogen plasma , the only one that has been studied in detail up to now .",
    "this case is quite realistic , because even a small amount of hydrogen on the surface of the neutron star is sufficient to fill the entire atmosphere .",
    "for instance , for a `` canonical '' neutron star ( with mass @xmath19 solar masses and radius @xmath20 km ) , the total mass of the hydrogen atmosphere is @xmath21  g , where @xmath0 is the bottom atmosphere density in g @xmath2 and @xmath22  k. this mass of hydrogen can be accreted from the interstellar medium or from a nebula surrounding the star , or produced in spallation of heavy nuclei by highly energetic plasma discharges in the polar - cap regions of a pulsar .",
    "the eos for partially ionized hydrogen at @xmath23  g@xmath24  g was calculated and discussed in @xcite ; recently it was extended to the case @xmath25",
    "g@xmath26  g @xcite and tabulated @xcite .",
    "the treatment is based on the free energy minimization .",
    "the free energy model is in essence a generalization of the nonmagnetic model of saumon and chabrier @xcite .",
    "we consider a plasma composed of @xmath27 protons , @xmath28 electrons , @xmath29 hydrogen atoms , and @xmath30 molecules in a volume @xmath31 , the number densities being @xmath32 .",
    "the helmholtz free energy is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the free energies of ideal gases of the electrons , protons , and neutral species , respectively , @xmath37 takes into account the coulomb plasma nonideality , and @xmath38 is the nonideal contribution which arises from interactions of bound species with one another and with the electrons and protons .",
    "ionization equilibrium is given by minimization of @xmath39 with respect to particle numbers under the stoichiometric constraints , keeping @xmath31 and the total number of protons ( free and bound ) constant .",
    "the formulae for each term in ( [ fren ] ) are given in @xcite .",
    "the employed minimization technique is similar to the one presented in @xcite for the nonmagnetic case .",
    "once the free energy is obtained , its derivatives over @xmath0 and @xmath3 and their combinations provide the other thermodynamic functions .",
    "these functions are affected by the strong magnetic field . in the domain of strongly quantizing field ( @xmath40 ,",
    "see @xcite ) , the electron degeneracy is reduced and the eos becomes softer than it would be at @xmath41 .",
    "if the field is weakly quantizing ( @xmath42 ) , the second - order thermodynamic functions oscillate with increasing @xmath0 around their field - free values ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ phase ] shows the domains of partial ionization in the @xmath43 plane for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "the higher @xmath11 , the greater @xmath3 at which the bound species are important .",
    "the calculated atomic fractions @xmath44 are needed to obtain the radiative opacities in the atmosphere ( see  [ sect : opacity ] below ) .",
    "our model becomes less reliable at relatively low @xmath3 where molecular chains h@xmath45 can be important @xcite .",
    "generally , this occurs within the @xmath43 domain where @xmath46 ( i.e. , to the left of the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ phase ] ) .",
    "a magnetic field affects the properties of electromagnetic radiation in plasmas ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at photon energies",
    "@xmath47 much higher than @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electron plasma frequency and @xmath0 is the density in @xmath50 , radiation propagates in the form of two so - called _",
    "normal modes_. these modes have different polarization vectors @xmath51 and different absorption and scattering coefficients , which depend on the angle @xmath52 between the radiation propagation direction and the magnetic field .",
    "the two modes interact with each other via scattering .    in a partially ionized atmosphere",
    ", the opacity for each normal mode is contributed by electrons , ions , and bound species .",
    "the scattering cross section includes contributions from the electrons and protons : @xmath53 ( the subscript @xmath54 denotes a basic photon polarization  longitudinal , right or left circular  with respect to the magnetic field direction ) .",
    "the absorption cross section @xmath55 includes contributions from absorption by plasma electrons and protons ( mainly by free - free transitions due to the electron - proton collisions , @xmath56 ) , transitions between discrete states of an atom ( bound - bound absorption , @xmath57 ) and photoionization ( bound - free , @xmath58 ) .",
    "thus , for the hydrogen atmosphere , we can write @xmath59 for the hydrogen in a strong magnetic field , the cross sections @xmath57 were studied in @xcite , @xmath58 in @xcite , and @xmath56 in @xcite .",
    "the bound species affect the dielectric tensor of the medium and hence the polarization properties of the normal modes .",
    "these effects were studied in @xcite , with use of the kramers - kronig relation between the imaginary and real parts of the plasma polarizability .",
    "the full account of the coupling of the quantum mechanical structure of the atoms to their center - of - mass motion across the magnetic field proved to be crucial for the correct evaluation of the plasma polarization properties and opacities .",
    "an example of the opacities is shown in fig .",
    "[ opacity ] . in this case , the ionization degree is high ( @xmath60 ) , but the account of the bound species is still important : in the photon energy ranges corresponding to the bound - bound and bound - free atomic transitions , the model of a fully ionized plasma underestimates the opacities by a factor of @xmath61 .    these results are used in modeling the spectra of radiation from the neutron - star atmospheres @xcite .",
    "an example shown on the left panel of fig .  [ spectrum ] clearly demonstrates the importance of the partial - ionization effects .",
    "the notion that an isolated magnetic neutron star has a condensed surface was first put forward by ruderman @xcite , who considered the fe surface .",
    "lai & salpeter @xcite ( see also @xcite ) studied the phase diagram of strongly magnetized hydrogen and showed that , if @xmath10 is below a critical value ( which is a function of @xmath11 ) , the atmosphere can undergo a phase transition into a condensed state .",
    "the thermal emission from the magnetized fe surface was studied in @xcite and most thoroughly in paper @xcite . for a smooth condensed surface ,",
    "the overall emission is reduced from the blackbody by less than a factor of 2 , whereas for a rough surface , the reduction can be negligible ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum exhibits modest deviation from blackbody across a wide energy range , and shows mild absorption features associated with the ion cyclotron frequency and the electron plasma frequency in the condensed matter .",
    "examples of the spectrum for different models of the surface are shown on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] .",
    "we have briefly reviewed the main effects of strong magnetic fields on the eos , opacities and properties of electromagnetic radiation in the surface layers of neutron stars . in order to calculate realistic spectra of thermal radiation from neutron stars",
    ", one must carefully take these effects into account .",
    "we expect that comparison of the calculated models with observations will help to improve the constraints on neutron star parameters ( for example , their effective temperatures , see @xcite ) and thus provide a powerful tool for testing the theories of superdense matter in neutron star interiors .",
