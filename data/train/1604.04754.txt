    "lattice networks are frequently employed to describe the mechanical response of materials and structures that are discrete by nature at one or more length scales , such as 3d - printed structures , woven textiles , paper , or foams . for lattice networks representing fibrous microstructures for instance , individual fibres",
    "can be identified with one - dimensional springs or beams .",
    "further examples are the models of e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "the reason why lattice models may be preferred over conventional continuum theories and finite element  ( fe ) approaches , is twofold .",
    "first , the meaning and significance of the physical parameters associated with individual interactions in the lattice networks is easy to understand , whereas the parameters in constitutive continuum models represent the small - scale mechanics only in a phenomenological manner .",
    "an example is the young s modulus or ultimate strength of a spring or beam ( fibre or yarn ) versus that of the network .",
    "second , the formulation and implementation of lattice models is generally significantly easier compared to that of alternative continuum models .",
    "large deformations , large yarn re - orientations , and fracture are for instance easier to formulate and implement ( cf .",
    "e.g. the continuum model of  @xcite that deals with large yarn re - orientations ) .",
    "thanks to the simplicity and versatility of lattice networks , they are furthermore used for the description of heterogeneous cohesive - frictional materials .",
    "the reason is that discrete models can realistically represent distributed microcracking with gradual softening , implement material structure with inhomogeneities , capture non - locality of damage processes , and reflect deterministic or stochastic size effects .",
    "examples of the successful use of lattice models for such materials are given by  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "as lattice models are typically constructed at the meso- , micro- , or nano - scale , they require reduced - model techniques to allow for application - scale simulations .",
    "a prominent example is the quasicontinuum  ( qc ) method , which specifically aims at discrete lattice models .",
    "the qc method was originally introduced for conservative atomistic systems by  @xcite and extended in numerous aspects later on , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "subsequent generalizations for lattices with dissipative interactions ( e.g. plasticity and bond sliding ) were provided by  @xcite . in principle , the qc is a numerical procedure that can deal with local lattice - level phenomena in small regions of interest , whereas the lattice model is coarse grained in the remainder of the domain .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to develop a qc framework that can deal with the initiation and subsequent propagation of damage and fracture in the underlying structural lattice model .",
    "because such a phenomenon tends to be a highly localized and rather unstable process , sensitive to local mesh details , the qc framework must fully refine in critical regions _ before _ any damage occurs in order to capture the physics properly , cf .",
    "[ sect : introduction : fig:1 ] . moreover ,",
    "as the entire problem is evolutionary , the location of the fully resolved region must evolve as well , which requires an adaptive qc framework .",
    "several previous studies have also focused on adaptivity in qc methodologies , but they were always dealing with atomistic lattice models at the nano - scale , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "contrary to that , this contribution focuses on structural lattice networks for materials with discreteness at the meso - scale .",
    "the qc approach aimed for is schematically presented in fig .",
    "[ sect : introduction : fig:1 ] .",
    "the macro - scale fracture emerges as individual interactions failures at the lattice level .",
    "their damage leads to strain - softening and hence , the fracture process zone remains spatially localized .",
    "consequently , only the crack tip and the process zone have to be fully resolved .",
    "the displacement fluctuations elsewhere remain small , allowing for efficient interpolation and coarse graining .",
    "due to the spatial propagation of the crack front through the system of interest , available qc formulations need to be generalized to involve dissipation induced by damage , and an adaptive meshing scheme that includes a suitable marking strategy needs to be developed .",
    "the theoretical framework employed in this contribution is closely related to our variational qc formulation for hardening plasticity discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the present work can be viewed as an extension towards lattices with localized damage and with an adaptive refinement strategy . in principle , the overall procedure is based on the variational formulation by  @xcite , developed for _ rate - independent _ inelastic systems .",
    "this variational formulation employs at each time instant  @xmath0 an incremental potential energy  @xmath1 , that can be minimized with respect to the observable ( kinematic ) as well as the internal ( history , dissipative ) variables , i.e. @xmath2 where  @xmath3 denotes a generalized state variable .",
    "hence , this formulation is different from the one employed in the virtual - power - based qc framework of  @xcite , which is based on the virtual - power statement of the lattice model in combination with a coleman - noll procedure .",
    "note that earlier variational formulations for rate - independent systems can be found e.g. in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical concepts of the variational formulation and its application to damaging lattice models are discussed in section  [ sect : varform ] .    after the incremental energy is presented for the full lattice system ,",
    "two reduction steps can be applied to it in analogy to the standard qc framework , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the first step , _ interpolation _",
    "constrains the displacements of all atoms according to the displacements of a number of selected representative atoms , or _",
    "repatoms _ for short .",
    "this procedure reduces the number of degrees of freedom drastically . in the second step ,",
    "only a small number of atoms is sampled to approximate the exact incremental energy  @xmath1 , its gradients , and hessians , analogously to the numerical integration of fe technology .",
    "this step is referred to as _ summation _ , and it entails also a significant reduction of the number of internal variables .",
    "together , the two steps yield a reduced state variable  @xmath4 and an approximate incremental energy  @xmath5 .",
    "in section  [ sect : qc ] , a more detailed discussion about qc techniques , adaptive modelling , marking strategy , and mesh refinement will be provided .",
    "consequences of the proposed mesh refinement strategy will be discussed also from the energetic point of view .",
    "the minimization problem   provides governing equations presented in section  [ sect : sol ] , where a suitable solution strategy is described .",
    "incremental energy minimization procedures often employ some version of the alternating minimization  ( am ) strategy , see e.g.  @xcite . the approach used here",
    ", however , minimizes the so - called _ reduced energy _ , i.e. the energy potential  @xmath1 with eliminated internal variables , cf .",
    "@xcite or  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the overall solution process simplifies and is more efficient compared to the am approach .    in section  [",
    "sect : examples ] , the proposed theoretical developments are first applied to an l - shaped plate test . the force - displacement diagrams and crack paths predicted with the adaptive qc approach are compared to those predicted with full lattice computations .",
    "further , the energy consistency during the entire evolution is assessed and the errors in energies are discussed .",
    "the second numerical example focuses on the antisymmetric four - point bending test , described e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "it demonstrates the ability of the adaptive qc scheme to predict nontrivial , curved crack paths .",
    "finally , this contribution closes with a summary and conclusions in section  [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we recall the general variational theory for rate - independent systems , followed by the geometric setting , description of state variables , and by the construction of energies .",
    "the entire exposition will be confined to 2d systems , but the extension to 3d is straightforward .",
    "let us note in addition that throughout this work the term `` atoms '' will be used to refer to individual lattice nodes or particles , consistently with the original qc terminology developed for atomistic systems .",

    "<S> lattice networks with dissipative interactions can be used to describe the mechanics of discrete micro- or meso - structures of materials such as 3d - printed structures and foams , or more generally heterogeneous materials . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution deals with the crack initiation and propagation in such materials and focuses on an adaptive multiscale approach that captures the spatially evolving fracture . </S>",
    "<S> lattice networks naturally incorporate non - locality , large deformations , and dissipative mechanisms taking place directly inside fracture zones . because the physically relevant length scales for fracture are significantly larger than those of individual interactions , discrete models are computationally expensive . </S>",
    "<S> the quasicontinuum  ( qc ) method is a multiscale approach specifically constructed for discrete models . </S>",
    "<S> this method reduces the computational cost by fully resolving the underlying lattice only in regions of interest , while coarsening elsewhere . in this contribution , </S>",
    "<S> an incremental energy potential corresponding to the full lattice model with damageable interactions is constructed for engineering - scale predictions . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , using a variational qc approach the incremental energy along with governing equations for the upscaled lattice network are derived . in order to deal with the spatially evolving fracture zone in an accurate , yet efficient manner </S>",
    "<S> , an adaptive scheme is proposed that utilizes the underlying lattice . </S>",
    "<S> implications induced by the adaptive procedure are discussed from the energy - consistency point of view , and theoretical considerations are demonstrated on two examples . </S>",
    "<S> the first one serves as a proof of concept , illustrates the consistency of the adaptive schemes , and presents errors in energies compared to the fully - resolved solution . </S>",
