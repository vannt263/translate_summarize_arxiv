    "over the past decade , taking the higher - categorical nature of various mathematical structures seriously has turned out to be a very fruitful idea in several areas of mathematics . in particular , the theory of _ @xmath0-categories _ ( or more precisely _ @xmath4-categories",
    "_ ) has found many applications in algebraic topology and in other fields . however , despite the large amount of work that has been carried out on the foundations of @xmath0-category theory , above all by joyal and lurie , the theory is in many ways still in its infancy , and the analogues of many concepts from ordinary category theory remain to be explored . in this paper",
    "we begin to study the natural analogue in the @xmath0-categorical context of one such concept , namely that of _ enriched categories_.    enriched categories in the usual sense are ubiquitous in modern mathematics : the morphisms between objects in naturally occurring categories often have more structure than just that of a set . however , there are a number of important situations where the classical theory of enriched categories has turned out to be insufficient in ways that lead us towards considering the higher - categorical version of enrichment . in algebraic topology ,",
    "for example , the categories that arise typically have a _ space _ of morphisms between any two objects  but it is usually only the ( weak ) homotopy types of these spaces that matter .",
    "navely , we might guess that this means we should consider these categories as enriched in the _ homotopy category _ of spaces , but this turns out to lose information that is important for most applications .",
    "we are therefore forced to consider the homotopy theory of categories enriched in topological spaces ( or any other model for the homotopy theory of spaces , such as simplicial sets ) , with respect to the appropriate notion of weak equivalences , which takes us outside the usual theory of enriched categories .",
    "it is possible to consider this homotopy theory in the context of quillen s model categories ( as was originally done by bergner @xcite for simplicial categories ) , but the resulting model structures are in some ways not very well - behaved , essentially because these `` strictly enriched '' categories are in a sense too rigid .",
    "this makes it hard to understand the correct homotopy types of the spaces of functors between them , and also makes homotopy - invariant constructions ( such as homotopy limits and colimits ) problematic to set up .",
    "an additional problem is that many naturally occurring composition laws between spaces are not strictly associative , but only associative up to coherent homotopy .",
    "this makes them difficult to model as simplicial or topological categories .",
    "it is therefore often more convenient to work with a notion of `` category enriched in spaces '' where composition of morphisms is only associative up to coherent homotopy .",
    "this is the idea behind the theory of _",
    "@xmath0-categories_. roughly speaking , the notion of @xmath0-category is a generalization of the notion of category where in addition to objects and morphisms we also have homotopies between morphisms , homotopies between homotopies , and so on , and composition is only associative up to a coherent choice of higher homotopies .",
    "there are several ways to make this idea precise , such as _ segal categories _ , _ complete segal spaces _ , and _",
    "quasicategories_. it turns out that working with @xmath0-categories also avoids the other problems with simplicial or topological categories mentioned above , such as the difficulty of constructing functor categories .",
    "a similar situation arises in other areas of mathematics , such as algebraic geometry or representation theory , where there are many examples of _ derived _ categories .",
    "these have traditionally been thought of as _ additive _ categories , which is to say categories enriched in abelian groups , equipped with the additional data of a _",
    "triangulation_. recently , however , it has been found that derived categories , and other triangulated categories , are not rich enough for many applications  the extra structure of the triangulation must be replaced by the more refined and intrinsic notion of a _ differential graded _ structure , i.e. an enrichment in chain complexes .",
    "the correct notion of an equivalence between these _ dg - categories _ does not require a dg - functor to be given by isomorphisms on chain complexes of maps , however  instead , the functor need only induce _ quasi - isomorphisms_. on the other hand , it is again not enough to consider these categories as simply enriched in the homotopy category of chain complexes ( i.e. the derived category of abelian groups )  just as a differential graded algebra ( or more generally an @xmath5-algebra ) is a much richer and more subtle object than a homotopy associative multiplication on a chain complex , the composition in a dg - category contains far more information than an enrichment in the homotopy category of chain complexes .",
    "homotopy - coherent compositions also occur in this context  a key example here is the _ fukaya categories _ of symplectic geometry .",
    "these can often be described using _",
    "@xmath5-categories _ , but unfortunately the theory of @xmath5-categories is not as well - behaved as a replacement for that of dg - categories as @xmath0-categories are as a replacement for simplicial categories .",
    "a third example of this type is _ spectral _ categories ( or categories enriched in spectra ) , of which there are many interesting examples in algebraic topology .",
    "these are much more general than dg - categories , and tend to arise in examples where the mapping spectra can only be extracted up to homotopy . to emphasize the subtleties of the situation , the very existence of a symmetric monoidal model for the homotopy theory of spectra ( under the smash product ) was only fairly recently resolved , after being an open question for several decades . moreover , in this context no notion of homotopy - coherent enrichment has so far been proposed ; this is a problem , for example because many important functors that are known to preserve @xmath5-structures , such as algebraic k - theory or topological hochschild homology , can not be realized as lax monoidal functors to a model category of spectra .",
    "now , just as spaces are the higher - categorical analogue of sets , spectra are the higher categorical analogue of abelian groups or chain complexes , and the sophisticated nature of these objects means that we require a more conceptual and less ad hoc approach to the homotopy theory of spectral categories than what is often sufficient in the theory of dg - categories . one way to do this is to set up model category structures on enriched categories  it is possible to treat the homotopy theory of dg - categories @xcite , spectral categories @xcite , or even categories enriched in other sufficiently nice monoidal model categories @xcite in this way .",
    "however , the resulting model categories suffer from the same problems as that of simplicial categories . in the case of dg - categories , for example , the correct spaces of dg - functors have only recently been explicitly described by ton @xcite , using a fairly complex construction ; there are earlier constructions of functor categories between @xmath5-categories @xcite , but these are also problematic .    in this paper we propose a different approach , namely to set up a general theory of weak or homotopy - coherent enrichment .",
    "specifically , we will define and study @xmath0-categories enriched in _",
    "monoidal @xmath0-categories _ , which are @xmath0-categories equipped with a tensor product that is associative and unital up to coherent homotopy .",
    "this theory encompasses , for example , analogues of spectral categories and dg - categories where composition is only associative up to coherent homotopy . for the former we consider @xmath0-categories enriched in the @xmath0-category of spectra , while for the latter we enrich in the _ derived @xmath0-category _ of abelian groups , in the sense of @xcite , i.e. the @xmath0-category obtained by inverting the quasi - isomorphisms between chain complexes of abelian gropus .",
    "the resulting homotopy theories of enriched @xmath0-categories are much better behaved than those of strictly enriched categories  for example , we have naturally defined enriched @xmath0-categories of functors between enriched @xmath0-categories .",
    "moreover , the resulting homotopy theories are _ equivalent _ to those of ordinary enriched categories , as is proved in @xcite .",
    "thus , our theory gives a more flexible approach to the homotopy theory of dg - categories and spectral categories , which we expect will make many construction in these settings easier to carry out .",
    "the idea of `` weak '' enrichment is also implicit in the concept of higher category theory itself : an @xmath6-category should have @xmath7-morphisms between @xmath8-morphisms for @xmath9 , so there is an @xmath10-category of maps between any two objects . as is well known , however , to obtain a good notion of @xmath6-category for @xmath11 it is not sufficient to just consider @xmath6-categories as _ strictly _ enriched in @xmath10-categories , as in most naturally occurring examples composition is only associative up to invertible higher morphisms .",
    "we can avoid this issue by instead applying our @xmath0-categorical theory of enrichment : iterating the enrichment procedure starting with the category of sets gives an inductively defined notion of fully weak @xmath6-category .",
    "starting instead with spaces we obtain a theory of @xmath3-categories , and we can also similarly define ( weak ) @xmath12-categories , which are @xmath6-categories where the @xmath13-morphisms are all invertible for @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the resulting homotopy theories are equivalent to those of existing models for @xmath6-categories and @xmath3-categories ( as is also proved in @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to the foundational work of lurie , we are able to set up our theory of enrichment entirely within the context of @xmath0-categories ( rather than working with model categories , say ) . apart from greater generality , working in this setting",
    "gives a theory with many good properties , including the following :    a.   weak ( or homotopy - coherent ) enrichment is the only natural notion of enrichment which is possible in this language , which allows us to define our enriched @xmath0-categories in the obvious way as `` many - object associative algebras '' in a given monoidal @xmath0-category .",
    "( in other words , the @xmath0-categorical analogue of `` strictly enriched '' categories automatically results in the appropriate `` weakly enriched '' theory . )",
    "b.   it is both easy and natural to consider enriched categories with _ spaces _ of objects rather than just sets of objects , which turns out to make the resulting homotopy theory both nicer and simpler to set up , analogous to the way in which ( complete ) segal spaces are better behaved than segal categories . c.   we automatically get very good naturality properties , some of which would have been difficult even to formulate in a model - categorical framework  for example , our @xmath0-categories are natural with respect to functors between monoidal @xmath0-categories that are lax monoidal in the appropriate @xmath0-categorical sense .",
    "this means that we can easily apply functors such as group completion , algebraic k - theory , and topological hochschild homology ( which are lax monoidal as functors of @xmath0-categories , but do not arise from lax monoidal functors between model categories ) to construct spectral @xmath0-categories .",
    "d.   we obtain the correct @xmath0-categories of enriched functors between enriched @xmath0-categories simply as the internal hom objects right adjoint to the natural tensor product of enriched @xmath0-categories . from the point of view of the model - categorical approach to enrichment",
    "this is in some sense the most subtle and useful feature  subtle because the homotopically correct internal hom must be invariant under enriched equivalences ( the primary defect of simplicial categories as a model for @xmath0-categories ) and useful because the existence of these functor @xmath0-categories makes constructions in , and the further development of , enriched higher category theory possible .",
    "e.   beyond just constructing a homotopy theory , our theory gives a good setting in which to develop @xmath0-categorical analogues of many concepts from enriched category theory , as we hope to demonstrate in future work .",
    "in addition to setting up the homotopy theory of enriched @xmath0-categories , we also construct several non - trivial examples : we show that lurie s _ stable @xmath0-categories _ from @xcite are all enriched in the @xmath0-category of spectra , and that the _ @xmath15-linear @xmath0-categories _ of @xcite are enriched in the @xmath0-category of @xmath15-modules , where @xmath15 is an @xmath16-ring spectrum .",
    "moreover , we prove that every closed monoidal @xmath0-category is enriched in itself .",
    "this gives us , for example , the natural @xmath6-category of functors between any two @xmath6-categories , generalizing the familiar fact that the category of categories is enriched over itself .",
    "we also discuss a number of simple applications of the theory .",
    "as mentioned above , we provide a reasonable definition of the @xmath0-category of weak @xmath17-categories for any @xmath6 and @xmath18 , which has the advantage of not relying on families of diagrams parametrizing coherence conditions and which agrees with those of barwick , bergner - rezk , joyal , and others . in this context",
    "we give a proof of `` baez - dolan stabilization '' for ( weak ) @xmath6-categories ( generalizing that of lurie for @xmath19-categories ) .",
    "this is the idea that , for @xmath20 , an @xmath18-tuply monoidal weak @xmath6-category is precisely an @xmath21-tuply monoidal weak @xmath6-category ( for example , putting two compatible monoidal structures on a category makes it a _ braided _ monoidal category , while three or more monoidal structures makes it _ symmetric _ monoidal ) .",
    "we also show that ( for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) an @xmath24-monoidal @xmath25-category is the same thing as an @xmath26-category with a single ( distinguished ) object and a single @xmath27-morphism for @xmath28 . finally , we show that we can easily construct , as spectral @xmath0-categories , certain homotopy theories of presheaves that are expected to be equivalent to familiar stable @xmath0-categories , such as the description of genuine @xmath29-spectra as the @xmath0-category of modules for the spectral @xmath0-category of stable orbits , or as modules over a spectral burnside @xmath0-category .",
    "the theory we set up in this article is the first completely general theory of weak enrichment .",
    "weak enrichment in _ cartesian _",
    "monoidal model categories has previously been defined as _",
    "segal enriched categories _ as studied by pellissier  @xcite , lurie  @xcite , and simpson  @xcite ( generalizing bergner s model structure on segal categories  @xcite).it is important to note that many of the interesting examples of enriched categories are cases ( such as abelian groups , chain complexes , and spectra ) in which the monoidal structure is not cartesian ; so , while more complicated to describe , allowing for non - cartesian enrichment is necessary to support the standard examples of interest .    in the non - cartesian case ,",
    "there is a theory of @xmath5-categories , which gives a notion of weak enrichment in chain complexes , and more recently bacard  @xcite has set up a model - categorical theory of weak enrichment in a class of symmetric monoidal model categories that can be applied to many interesting examples .",
    "a definition of enriched @xmath0-categories different from ours has also been given by lurie  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 4.2.1.28 ) , but he does not develop this theory beyond defining the objects .",
    "we will see in  [ sec : selfenr ] that in many cases we can extract an enriched @xmath0-category in our sense from one of lurie s , and we hope to be able to extend this construction to a comparison between our theory and lurie s in the future .      in  [ sec :",
    "fromto ] we introduce our definition of enriched @xmath0-categories in terms of ( generalized ) non - symmetric @xmath0-operads , and motivate it by explaining how it relates to ordinary enriched categories .    in  [ sec : nsop ] we briefly describe the non - symmetric version of lurie s theory of ( generalized ) @xmath0-operads , and prove some ( straightforward , for the most part ) extensions of lurie s results .",
    "the most technical results , particularly those building towards the construction of colimits of algebras , have been relegated to appendix  [ sec : algcolims ] .",
    "the theory of @xmath0-operads lets us define , for a monoidal @xmath0-category @xmath1 , an @xmath0-category @xmath30 of @xmath1-enriched @xmath0-categories ; this is our object of study in ",
    "[ sec : algcat ] .",
    "the main result is that if the @xmath0-category @xmath1 is presentable and its tensor product preserves colimits in each variable , then this @xmath0-category is also presentable .",
    "we also compare this model of enriched @xmath0-categories to a certain @xmath0-category of presheaves that satisfy analogues of the segal condition for segal spaces .",
    "in  [ sec : cativ ] we construct the correct @xmath0-category of enriched @xmath0-categories by inverting the fully faithful and essentially surjective functors in @xmath30 . here",
    "we prove the main theorem of this article : we can obtain this localization as the full subcategory of @xmath30 spanned by the _",
    "complete _ @xmath1-@xmath0-categories  those @xmath1-@xmath0-categories @xmath31 such that the underlying space of objects in @xmath31 is equivalent to the classifying space of equivalences in @xmath31 .",
    "we also prove that the resulting @xmath0-category has the expected naturality properties .",
    "in  [ sec : appl ] we describe some simple applications of our construction : first we set up a theory of @xmath12-categories and prove the `` homotopy hypothesis '' in this setting .",
    "we then prove that enriching in an @xmath19-category gives an @xmath32-category of enriched @xmath0-categories ; from this the baez - dolan stabilization hypothesis for @xmath7-tuply monoidal @xmath6-categories follows easily if we define @xmath6-categories to be @xmath3-categories enriched in sets .",
    "we also show that @xmath24-algebras in an @xmath24-monoidal @xmath0-category @xmath1 embed fully faithfully into _ pointed _",
    "@xmath1-enriched @xmath3-categories .",
    "this last result has a number of interesting corollaries , such as a description of @xmath24-monoidal @xmath0-categories as @xmath33-categories with a single object and a single @xmath27-morphism for @xmath34 , and a simple construction of endomorphism algebras .    in  [ sec : selfenr ] we construct an important class of examples of enriched @xmath0-categories : if an @xmath0-category @xmath31 is right - tensored over a monoidal @xmath0-category @xmath1 in such a way that the tensor product @xmath35 has a right adjoint @xmath36 for all @xmath37 , we show that @xmath31 is enriched in @xmath1 with the maps from @xmath38 to @xmath39 given by @xmath40 .",
    "there are several interesting special cases : a closed monoidal @xmath0-category is enriched in itself , and all stable @xmath0-categories are enriched in the @xmath0-category of spectra .",
    "we prove this result by considering lurie s definition of enriched @xmath0-categories and observing that we can extract an enriched @xmath0-category in our sense by means of lurie s construction of an @xmath0-category of `` enriched strings '' .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ sec : algcolims ] we prove some more technical results about non - symmetric @xmath0-operads .      in this article we will work throughout in the setting of @xmath4-categories , by which we mean ( heuristically ) higher categories in which the @xmath6-morphisms are invertible for @xmath41 .",
    "specifically , we will make use of the theory of quasicategories , as , due to the work of joyal and lurie , it is currently by far the most highly developed theory of @xmath4-categories .",
    "following lurie we will refer to these objects as @xmath0-categories , however .",
    "we generally recycle the notation and terminology used by lurie in @xcite ; here are some exceptions and reminders :    * @xmath42 is the simplicial indexing category , with objects the non - empty finite totally ordered sets @xmath43 : = \\{0 , 1 , \\ldots , n\\}$ ] and morphisms order - preserving functions between them . *",
    "@xmath44 is the category of pointed finite sets ( so , by our convention , @xmath45 is the _ opposite _ of the category of pointed finite sets ) .",
    "* generic categories are generally denoted by single capital bold - face letters ( @xmath46 ) and generic @xmath0-categories by single caligraphic letters ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "specific categories and @xmath0-categories both get names in the normal text font : thus the category of small @xmath48-categories is denoted @xmath49 and the @xmath0-category of small @xmath1-@xmath0-categories is denoted @xmath50 .",
    "* @xmath51 is the category of simplicial sets , i.e. the category @xmath52 of set - valued presheaves on @xmath42 .",
    "* @xmath53 is the @xmath0-category of spaces ; this can be defined as the coherent nerve @xmath54 of the full simplicial subcategory @xmath55 of @xmath51 spanned by the kan complexes .",
    "* we say a class of morphisms in an @xmath0-category _ satisfies the 2-out - of-3 property _ if given morphisms @xmath56 and @xmath57 , if any two out of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 are in the class , so is the third . *",
    "if @xmath31 is an @xmath0-category and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are objects of @xmath31 , then we write @xmath63 ( or just @xmath64 if the @xmath0-category @xmath31 is obvious from the context ) for the space of maps from @xmath61 to @xmath62 in @xmath31 . in the context of quasicategories",
    "there are a number of explicit models for these mapping spaces as simplicial sets ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , but for our purposes it suffices to think of @xmath63 as an object of the @xmath0-category of spaces .",
    "constructions of such a `` mapping space functor '' @xmath65 can be found in @xcite and @xcite . * to distinguish the @xmath0-categories of non - symmetric @xmath0-operads and their algebras from their symmetric counterparts we use a superscript `` @xmath66 '' for the non - symmetric versions and a superscript `` @xmath67 '' for the symmetric versions .",
    "thus the @xmath0-category of non - symmetric @xmath0-operads is denoted @xmath68 and the @xmath0-category of symmetric @xmath0-operads @xmath69 . however , we take the non - symmetric versions to be the default ones in this paper and thus often do not include the superscript  for example , if @xmath70 and @xmath71 are non - symmetric @xmath0-operads we will generally denote the @xmath0-category of @xmath70-algebras in @xmath71 by @xmath72 . *",
    "we make use of the elegant theory of _ grothendieck universes _ to allow us to define ( @xmath0-)categories without being limited by set - theoretical size issues ; specifically , we fix three nested universes , and refer to sets contained in them as _ small _ , _ large _ , and _ very large_. when @xmath31 is an @xmath0-category of small objects of a certain type , we generally refer to the corresponding @xmath0-category of large objects as @xmath73 , without explicitly defining this object . for example , @xmath74 is the ( large ) @xmath0-category of small @xmath0-categories , and @xmath75 is the ( very large ) @xmath0-category of large @xmath0-categories . *",
    "if @xmath31 is an @xmath0-category , we write @xmath76 for the _ interior _ or _ underlying space _ of @xmath31 , i.e. the largest subspace of @xmath31 that is a kan complex . *",
    "we write @xmath77 for the @xmath0-category of left fibrations over @xmath31 ( for example obtained from the covariant model structure on @xmath78 ) .",
    "similarly , we write @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the @xmath0-categories of cartesian and cocartesian fibrations to @xmath31 , respectively , i.e. the @xmath0-categories associated to the cartesian and cocartesan model structures on @xmath81 . *",
    "we denote by @xmath82 the @xmath0-category of presentable @xmath0-categories and colimit - preserving functors . *",
    "if @xmath83 is left adjoint to a functor @xmath84 , we will refer to the adjunction as @xmath85 . * if @xmath86 is a simplicial set we write @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the _",

    "if @xmath31 is an @xmath0-category , we can interpret @xmath90 and @xmath91 as the @xmath0-categories obtained by freely adjoining an initial object and a final object to @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "we denote the `` cone points '' coming from @xmath92 in @xmath93 and @xmath94 by @xmath95 and @xmath0 , respectively . *",
    "a simplicial set @xmath86 is _ sifted _ if it is non - empty and the diagonal map @xmath96 is cofinal ; see @xcite for alternative characterizations .",
    "the key point is that sifted colimits are generated by filtered colimits and colimits of simplicial objects , and small colimits are generated by sifted colimits and finite coproducts .",
    "as far as possible we argue using the `` high - level '' language of @xmath0-categories , without referring to their specific implementation as quasicategories . following this philosophy we have generally not distinguished notationally between categories and their nerves , since categories are a special kind of @xmath0-category .",
    "however , we do indicate the nerve ( using @xmath97 ) when we think of the nerve of a category as being a specific simplicial set ; by the same principle we always indicate the nerves of simplicial categories .",
    "this should hopefully not cause any confusion .",
