    "weak localization is one of longest studied of mesoscopic phenomena , and its discovery in the 1980s provided one of the earliest demonstrations of how transport in disordered conductors may be influenced by phase coherence of the wavefunction @xcite . arising from the coherent interference of time - reversed pairs of feynman paths , which return to their origin after a sequence of elastic scattering events , this _ coherent backscattering _ enhances the resistance above its drude value .",
    "the size of this quantum correction is governed by the presence of inelastic scattering in the system ( such as that which can arise from electron - phonon or quasi - eleastic electron - electron interactions ) , which introduces an effective cut - off in the feynman - path length for which the coherent backscattering can occur @xcite .",
    "the weak localization can also be quenched by the application of a magnetic field , which breaks the time - reversal symmetry required for coherent backscattering and generates a negative magneto - resistance .",
    "a notable variation on this scenario is provided in systems with strong spin - orbit coupling , in which the additional berry phase accumulated during backscattering leads to weak antilocalization , the quenching of which in a magnetic field is manifested as a _ positive _ magneto - resistance @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been renewed theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite interest in weak localization , motivated by its various manifestations in graphene .",
    "the unusual aspects of the bandstructure of this material , namely its linear dispersion , its equivalent ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) valleys , and the chiral nature of its carriers , give rise to a rich variety of phenomena , not normally associated with weak localization in more conventional systems @xcite . also important is the nature of the impurities , or defects , responsible for scattering , with exact backscattering being forbidden for remote impurities that generate long - range scattering @xcite . as such , this behavior corresponds to weak antilocalization , in spite of the very weak spin - orbit coupling intrinsic to graphene .",
    "this behavior is modified , however , in the presence of inter - valley scattering generated by short - ranged impurities , and the trigonal warping of the graphene bands .",
    "these processes suppress weak antilocalization , and restore the negative magneto - resistance associated with weak localization , the features of which therefore reflect a complex interplay among a number of characteristic scattering times .",
    "these effects have now been explored in several experiments @xcite .    among the large number of studies of weak localization that have been undertaken in graphene , as well as in more conventional materials , the vast majority have focused on inferring information on the localization process from studies of the _ linear _ conductance .",
    "more specifically , most of these works have addressed the manner in which the localization is suppressed by the application of a magnetic field , which breaks time - reversal symmetry and introduces an effective decoherence into electron diffusion @xcite .",
    "in contrast , far fewer studies have considered the manner in which weak localization is affected under conditions of nonlinear transport .",
    "notable exceptions to this include early works that demonstrated the inability of an electric field to break time - reversal during coherent backscaterring @xcite , and more later experiments on the differential conductance of gaas / algaas quantum dots @xcite , short metallic nanobridges @xcite , and graphene transistors @xcite . in spite of these studies ,",
    "the fact remains that there is still relatively little that is understood about the manner in which weak localization in graphene ( as well as in other dirac materials ) is affected under nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "it is this specific problem that we address in this paper , in which we derive an expression for the nonlinear differential conductance of weakly - disordered graphene in the presence of weak localization .        in one of the earliest theoretical works to address the role of weak localization , gor'kov , larkin , and khmel'nitski @xcite derived the logarithmic variation of the conductivity that is the hallmark of this phenomenon .",
    "their linear - response calculation revealed a diffusion picture of transport , in which the electron momentum is gradually reversed through a series of elastic - scattering events , thereby accounting for the backscattering that is the source of the localization .",
    "this picture was subsequently developed into a comprehensive linear - response theory , in which the localization correction to the classical diffusion current is related to a two - particle propagator known as the cooperon @xcite .",
    "the cooperon consists of a quasiparticle that follows a diffusive path , and which interferes with its time - reversed partner , providing the natural viewpoint from which to discuss weak localization . as a linear - response construct ,",
    "however , the cooperon may only be utilized under equilibrium , or quasi - equilibrium , conditions , and hence is not applicable in the nonlinear regime of interest here .",
    "we therefore adopt an alternative approach to treat weak localization , as proposed by shon and ferraz @xcite and also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to calculate the charge current flowing through the system under the application of an electric field , by employing nonequilibrium green functions that allow the ( nonequilibrium ) distribution of its electronic structure to be accessed . under spatial averaging ,",
    "one obtains different classes of diagrams that correspond to distinct physical properties .",
    "we specifically distinguish here between rainbow and maximally - crossed diagrams , which provide the impurity - limited average scattering lifetime in the self - consistent born approximation , and the weak - localization correction , respectively .",
    "( mixed diagrams are omitted since their contributions are generally smaller by an order of magnitude or more , in , for example , the scattering potential . )",
    "as noted above , to calculate the weak - localization correction , and its dependence on voltage bias , we derive an expression for the charge current and the differential conductance of the system , in terms of the nonequilibrium distribution of its electronic structure . with the graphene contacted by a pair of metallic leads",
    ", its electronic structure is calculated subject to the boundary conditions imposed by the couplings to these leads . to introduce weak disorder into the graphene layer , we include short - range scattering centers that play the role of atomically - sharp defects .",
    "( the role of long - range disorder , such as that which is typically generated by substrate impurities , is therefore not considered here . in this sense ,",
    "our analysis is pertinent to intrinsic graphene , in the presence of local imperfections and defects , but free of any substrate interactions . ) by performing an impurity average of the electronic structure , we then obtain a description that is local in momentum space , and in which the scattering self - energy can be classified in terms of either rainbow or maximally - crossed diagrams ( with mixed diagrams being omitted ) .",
    "previously @xcite , it has been shown that , in order to capture the features of weak localization in graphene , it is necessary to include all hikami boxes when calculating the cooperons . in our approach , this amounts to calculating the correction introduced by the maximally - crossed diagrams @xcite . in doing so , it is neccessary to recognize the importance of the intra- and inter - valley scattering @xcite , a particular feature of bi - partite lattices such as that in graphene .",
    "using the methods outlined above , we determine the weak localization correction in graphene , and its dependence on the presence of an applied voltage .",
    "the essential outcome of our analytical calculation is that the voltage introduces an additional dephasing time ( @xmath2 ) in transport , which in many ways is analogous to the effective dephasing that can also be induced by a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "if we consider a scenario in which all other sources of dephasing can be neglected , this voltage - induced dephasing represents an unavoidable source of decoherence that places a cut - off on the maximum path length that may be involved in coherent interference ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - wl1 ] ) . in practice , this mechanism will co - exist with other sample - dependent sources of decoherence , including electron - phonon and electron - electron scattering .",
    "the voltage - induced dephasing can also be expected to arise in other graphene - like materials , including topological insulators @xcite and magnon dirac materials @xcite .",

    "our approach here involves employing a commonly used model for pristine graphene , namely the tight - binding lattice . to account for lattice imperfections , and for other kinds of defects that may be present in graphene",
    ", we introduce a random collection of short - ranged impurities into the lattice .",
    "care is necessary in this process , because of the presence of two inequivalent sub - lattices on which the impurities may be located . in our calculations , we will assume that there are equal numbers of impurities in each sub - lattice , since this situation should best correspond to a random - distribution scenario .",
    "the role of long - ranged impurities ( such as those associated with some supporting substrate ) is not considered in this work , allowing us to identify the intrinsic aspects of weak localization in this material .",
    "we begin by first of all modeling pristine graphene with the following hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the electron operator in the @xmath6- and @xmath7- sub - lattice , respectively , the intersite hopping rate is denoted by @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denotes a summation over nearest neighbors . under the assumption of a spin - degenerate system ,",
    "the spin subscript @xmath10 becomes redundant and is therefore henceforth omitted .",

    "free electrons have the dispersion relation @xmath28 around the @xmath0-points @xmath29 , where we have introduced the fermi velocity @xmath30 .",
    "finally , in @xmath31-space the scattering potential assumes the form @xmath32/\\omega$ ] , where @xmath33 is the volume of the system .",
    "in order to compute its conductance , the disordered graphene flake is placed in the junction between a pair of metallic leads , which we model here with hamiltonians @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where the chemical potentials @xmath36 are related to the applied voltage @xmath37 by @xmath38 .",
    "tunneling between the leads and the graphene is modeled using @xmath39 , where the row vector @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) denotes the tunneling rate between the left ( right ) lead and the graphene , and the pseudo - spinor @xmath42 .",

    "( [ eq - i ] ) , it can be seen that the essential physics that we aim to describe is contained in the lesser and greater green functions .",
    "the task in the following sections is to provide a coherent picture of the transport properties in terms of these correlation functions .",
    "in this section , we discuss how we use green function techniques to calculate the electronic structure properties , and thus the weak localization correction , in graphene .",
    "since we assume nonequilibrium conditions , we have to expand on the keldysh contour and nonequilibrium green functions .",
    "absence of time - dependent fields and processes allows for a conversion to fourier space , keeping in mind that the propagators are functions of the complex variable @xmath53 and that physical quantities are obtained through analytical continuation .",

    "resorting to numerical simulations , we can make analytical progress here by performing impurity averaging of each contribution in the above expansion .    before proceeding",

    "( [ eq - vexpansion ] ) leads to a corresponding expansion of the current , allowing it to be expressed in the form @xmath59 .",
    "the leading term here contains impurity scattering to the level of the self - consistent born approximation , in which scattering from different impurities is taken to be independent , and so only provides a lifetime broadening in the density of electron states .",
    "it is the correction @xmath60 , on the other hand , that pertains to weak localization , and in the remainder of this article we therefore focus on determining this term , without paying any further attention to @xmath61 .    due to the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq - vexpansion ] ) , and to the impurity averaging , the decomposition of the current can be viewed as an effect of the lesser / greater green function , which can be written as @xmath62 here , the retarded / advanced green function @xmath63 includes scattering up to the level of the self - consistent born approximation .",
    "the self - energy @xmath64 accounts for the coupling to the leads , and hence the nonequilibrium nature of the problem , and describes impurity scattering up to the level necessary to capture weak localization . as we shall see below , @xmath64 is included in @xmath65 also , allowing us to write @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a matrix comprising the impurity scattering not included in @xmath68 .",
    "this naturally leads to the decomposition of the current in terms of its regular component @xmath61 and a correction @xmath60 attributed to weak localization .      to calculate the weak localization correction to the conductance",
    ", we make an average over impurities located at positions @xmath69 , thereby accounting for their presence in a mean - field form that surrenders the non - locality of the green function in reciprocal space . to first order in the scattering potential ,",

    "[ fig - fig1](a ) . under the assumption of equal numbers of impurities in the two sublattices , @xmath71 ,",
    "we can write @xmath72 where @xmath73 defines the concentration of impurities . this leads to the result that the first - order correction to the reciprocal space green function is given by @xmath74 applying the same procedure to the second - order component in eq .",

    "[ fig - fig1](b ) and [ fig - fig1](c ) , respectively .",
    "we notice here that the distribution of impurities between the two sub - lattices leads to a restricted contribution from @xmath76 , such that it picks out just the diagonal components .",
    "while this structural organization is unimportant for the second - order contribution , we shall see below that it can be extremely important for some of the higher - order ones .",
    "the second - order correction can be summarized as @xmath77\\bfg^3_\\bfk      +      cu^2\\bfg_\\bfk\\tilde\\bfg\\bfg_\\bfk      , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 . here , again , the first term is structureless and so unimportant to our discussion , since it can be absorbed into the single - particle energy .",
    "the last term , on the other hand , is of major interest since it provides the first diagram in the class of rainbow diagrams , see fig .",
    "[ fig - fig1](c ) . a partial summation over this class of diagrams leads to a dressed graphene green function and , hence , to the electronic structure in which the effective impurity limited scattering life - time @xmath79 is included .",
    "taking this observation as guidance , we define the self - energy in the self - consistent born approximation in terms of the impurity averaged green function @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 ) @xmath82 where the impurity averaged green function is given in terms of the dyson equation @xmath83)^{-1}$ ] . by making the ansatz @xmath84 for the retarded form of the self - energy",

    "we may therefore neglect @xmath87 , and retain only the approximate inverse life - time @xmath94    summation over all diagrams of this ( self - consistent born approximation ) type describes the essential non - zero temperature transport for the materials that we consider .",
    "for instance , in the case of two - dimensional metals this leads to the usual ohmic current - voltage dependence , whereas the scattering processes which involve a higher degree of correlations between the feynman paths give only a negligible contribution . in the low - temperature regime",
    "this statement is not valid any longer as we shall see in the subsequent discussion .    in the high - temperature range",
    ", one can essentially argue from assumptions @xcite that , since all relevant momenta and energies are confined to the neighborhood of the fermi surface , any difference in magnitude between higher - order diagrams of type ( g ) and ( h ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig1 ] must lie in the angular integrations .",
    "for diagrams of type ( g ) , each of the three green functions yields a contribution of @xmath88 where @xmath79 is the elastic scattering life - time , which leads to an overall contribution of order @xmath95 . for diagrams of type ( h ) , on the other hand ,",
    "only two green functions contribute to @xmath96 and angular integration of the third leads to a contribution of the order of @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the fermi energy .",
    "the ratio between these two types of diagrams is therefore of order @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the fermi momentum and @xmath101 is the impurity mean free path ( with @xmath102 the fermi velocity ) .",
    "while this line of argument applies well to conventional metals , the situation is somewhat more subtle for graphene .",
    "nonetheless , at sufficiently high temperatures , the above arguments are satisfactory .      in the theory of weak localization for weakly - disorded metals",
    ", it is well known that diagrams containing crossed impurity lines are smaller by a factor @xmath103 than those ( of the same order in the impurity potential ) without any such lines @xcite . on the other hand , the maximally - crossed diagrams give rise to a contribution that is of the same order of magnitude as that generated by the uncrossed ones .",
    "hence , in constructing the self - energy functional for the kinetic equation , it is necessary to sum over the maximally - crossed diagrams .",
    "an example of a maximally - crossed diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig1](h ) , which represents the lowest order diagram in this class .",
    "algebraically , this diagram can be written as @xmath104 where @xmath105 , again under the assumption that the number of impurities @xmath106 .",
    "an alternative way to represent the diagram corresponding to this lowest order maximally - crossed diagram is given in fig .",

    "before we continue with the evaluation of this diagram , we make a few observations concerning the matrices @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "first , these matrices are projections , such that @xmath110 , and they are clearly orthogonal ( @xmath111 ) . moreover , for a general @xmath112 matrix @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 and @xmath115 , while @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where @xmath118 . hence , any matrix product on the form @xmath119 can be reduced to @xmath120 due to this latter property of the matrix structure , we can perform all evaluations of the crossed diagrams element by element . while these calculations are somewhat straightforward , we briefly go through some of their important features here .",
    "firstly , working under our assumption of spin - degeneracy , the diagonal components of the graphene green function are equal and we , therefore , only have to consider one of them .",
    "an analogous observation holds for the off - diagonal components .",
    "secondly , calculation of all matrix components in the self - energy is fundamentally important since the coupling between the pseudo - spin degrees of freedom plays a central role in the theory of weak localization in graphene @xcite . making use of these properties , along with those of the crossed diagrams summarized in eq .",
    "( [ eq - matrixstructure ] ) , we write the upper left and right components to @xmath121 as    @xmath122    where the subscripts refer to matrix components and where    @xmath123    to evaluate the momentum summation contained in the expression for @xmath124 , we expand the green functions around the nodes in the two valleys @xmath125 .",
    "the influence of both intra- and inter - valley scattering , necessary to the theoretical description of weak localization @xcite , is included in this problem by individually expanding the green functions in the two valleys , in the product above .",

    "the denominator @xmath143 then becomes proportional to @xmath144 , resulting in the final form shown on the right - hand side of this equation .",

    "we can now write the kernels @xmath124 according to    @xmath145    then , by finally performing the angular integration , we arrive at the expressions    @xmath146    where in the result for @xmath147 we have replaced @xmath148 by @xmath149 ( since @xmath150 ) and in that for @xmath141 we have neglected a minor contribution proportional to @xmath151 .",
    "in fact , the second contribution to @xmath141 can also be omitted since it merely renormalizes the final expression without changing its vital properties pertaining to weak localization .",

    "( [ eq - tau ] ) is a consequence of the linear energy dispersion of graphene , but is not unique to this material ; it has also been obtained in studies of topological insulators @xcite , and in magnon dirac materials @xcite . a similarly energy - dependent lifetime",
    "has moreover been found in experimental and theoretical studies of the influence of individual and multiple scattering centers in graphene @xcite , in which systems the width of the impurity resonance typically decreases the closer the resonance is to the dirac point .",
    "the same property , namely the energy dependence of the impurity resonance width , is retained also in the presence of impurity averaging , as would be expected from the self - consistent born approximation .      in fig .",
    "[ fig - digr](a ) , we show the calculated differential conductance due to weak localization at several different temperatures .",

    "the weak localization is responsible for the suppression of the differential conductance near zero bias . reflecting the thermal broadening introduced by the fermi functions , the strength of this suppression grows steadily as the temperature is lowered .",
    "qualitatively , at least , these behaviors resemble those reported in recent experiments @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig - digr](b ) , we re - plot the differential - conductance data of panel ( a ) with voltage indicated on a logarithmic axis , revealing the presence of a temperature - dependent threshold beyond which the conductance increases logarithmically with voltage .",
    "a careful inspection of these data shows that the crossover from an invariant to a logarithmically increasing conductance occurs once the size of the energy window ( @xmath183 ) opened by the applied voltage exceeds the thermal energy ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "this should provide a quantitative prediction for comparison with future experiment .",
    "in summary , in this theoretical study we have explored the manner in which the quantum correction due to weak localization is suppressed in weakly - disordered graphene under the application of a nonequilibrium voltage .",
    "our calculations of the charge current and the resulting differential conductance reveal the typical logarithmically - divergent behavior associated with weak localization in more conventional metals and semiconductors .",
    "the main finding of our work is that the non - zero voltage bias destroys the weak localization contribution in graphene , by introducing a voltage - dependent dephasing time ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "the voltage - induced dephasing process arises from the fact that the wave packets traversing the closed scattering loops have an energy spread which leads to a decreased efficiency of the constructive interference from which the weak localization emerges .",
