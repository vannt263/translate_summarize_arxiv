    "in recent years there has been an extensive debate over the origin of hot subdwarf stars , largely because they seem to provide the best explanation for the uv - upturn seen in elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  yi , demarque & oemler 1997 , 1998 ; han , podsiadlowski & lynas - gray 2007 ) .",
    "the production of such stars in globular clusters , where they are often referred to as _ extreme horizontal branch _ ( ehb ) stars , has been a long - standing mystery ( see , e.g. , van den bergh 1967 ; sandage & wildey 1967 ; soker 1998 ; han 2008 ) .",
    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are believed to be helium - core - burning stars with masses @xmath0 , posessing very small ( @xmath1 ) hydrogen - rich envelopes ( heber 1986 ; saffer et al .",
    "their formation has been studied in some detail by han et al .",
    "( 2002 & 2003 ) , who showed that binary evolution can account for the properties of the observed sdb stars .",
    "other authors have suggested enhanced mass - loss from single red - giant stars in order to try to explain the formation of sdb stars ( e.g.  yi et al .",
    "1997 ; see also han , podsiadlowski & eggleton 1994 ) , or mixing driven by a very late helium flash ( sweigart 1997 ; brown et al .",
    "2001 ) , or that interactions with planets can eject the envelopes of red giants ( soker 1998 ; nelemans & tauris 1998 ) .",
    "subdwarf o ( sdo ) stars are assumed to be related to sdb stars .",
    "stroeer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have examined the formation of sdo stars and concluded that the sdo stars with a subsolar photospheric helium abundance ( ` helium - deficient ' ) have a different origin to the ` helium - enriched ' ( he - rich ) sdo stars ( which they define as having a super - solar helium abundance ) . specifically , stroeer et al .",
    "found that the helium - deficient sdo stars are likely to be evolved sdb stars , but that the he - rich sdo stars can not be explained through the canonical evolution of sdb stars .",
    "proposed formation channels for those he - rich sdo stars include mergers of two helium white dwarfs ( saio & jeffery 2000 ) and the ` hot flasher scenario ' ( e.g.  moehler et al .",
    "2007 ; miller bertolami et al .  2008 ) .",
    "though neither of these models seems entirely satisfactory , one piece of evidence which apparently favours the white - dwarf merger scenario is the very low binary fraction of the he - rich sdo stars ( see , e.g. , heber et al .",
    "2006 ; heber 2008 ) .",
    "here we show that the existence of he - rich sdo stars , including single ones , is a natural consequence of one of the binary formation channels for sdb stars .. ]    section [ sec : explanation ] explains the proposed formation channel , where section [ sec : evolutions ] presents evolutionary calculations and section [ sec : populations ] compares population synthesis expectations to the observed sample of he - rich sdo stars .",
    "section [ sec : doublecore ] then introduces a new formation channel for double hot subdwarfs and examines its possible implications .",
    "the merger of a helium white dwarf ( wd ) with a post - sdb star is predicted in one of the important binary channels for the formation of sdb stars ( han et al .",
    "2002 ; 2003 ) , but has not been considered in detail before . here",
    "we propose that such mergers are the natural progenitors of he - rich sdo stars .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 2002 & 2003 ) showed that a significant fraction of sdb stars is expected to exist in short - period binaries containing a helium wd ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : initdist ] ) .",
    "this is the result of the ` second common - envelope channel ' , where a wd spirals into the giant envelope of the sdb progenitor , thereby ejecting that envelope .",
    "after the helium - burning phase of the sdb star has been completed , the remnant will become a hybrid wd with a carbon - oxygen ( co ) core and a thick helium ( he ) envelope .",
    "if the orbital period is short enough , 7 hr for interaction within a hubble time ; see footnote [ fn : pmerge ] . ] gravitational radiation will drive the binary components towards each other until eventually mass transfer is initiated from the lighter helium wd onto the post - sdb he - co wd star .",
    "once a sufficiently thick helium shell has been built up around the co core , helium will ( re-)ignite in this shell . in the following section",
    ", we will show that such objects have all the main observational characteristics of he - rich sdo stars .    following the pioneering work of saio & nomoto ( 1998 ) , saio & jeffery ( 2000 , 2002 ) simulated the merger of white dwarfs ( first of two he wds and later of a 0.6 @xmath2 co wd accreting from a he wd ) .",
    "the situation we consider here is very similar ; even though our calculations in section [ sec : evolutions ] do not treat the mass - transfer / merger phase , the work of saio & jeffery strongly suggests that the post - merger star will undergo stable helium burning , with weak he shell flashes during the accretion phase .",
    "we can not completely exclude the possibility of catastrophic explosive he burning that could destroy the star or eject a large fraction of the accreted envelope , but the accretion rates in this case are significantly higher than those predicted to produce ` .ia ' supernovae ( see , e.g. , bildsten et al",
    ".  2007 ; shen & bildsten 2009 ) .",
    "however , since we can not properly calculate the burning during the accretion phase , we can not show how the newly - reignited systems behave during their approach to equilibrium . in principle , some of the observed he - sdos could be systems which have not yet attained their thermal equilibrium structure .",
    "not all of these systems should experience dynamically unstable mass transfer .",
    "the results of han & webbink ( 1999 ) indicate that the mass transfer from the helium white dwarf in these systems will usually be dynamically unstable , leading to a merger and ultimately a single he - rich sdo star .",
    "this may naturally explain the high fraction of apparently single he - rich sdo stars ( see , e.g. , stroeer et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , the systems which undergo a stable mass - transfer phase could potentially leave binary he - rich sdo stars . in this case",
    ", the sdo star could still be in a close binary with an orbital period @xmath3hr and be accreting at a low rate from a potentially very low - mass companion ( i.e.  a few 0.01m@xmath4 ; see , e.g. , fig .",
    "7 in rappaport , podsiadlowski & horev [ 2009 ] ; also see the case of the millisecond pulsar psr 1957 + 20 [ fruchter et al .  1988 ] ) .      for our stellar evolution calculations we used eggleton s stellar evolution code ( eggleton 1971 ; pols et al .",
    "1995 ) with a metallicity of 0.02 along with the convective overshooting calibration of pols et al .",
    "we first evolved a set of sdb stars using sdb models from han et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) in order to produce a set of post - sdb models onto which matter was added from an assumed helium wd companion .    for the sdb stars which undergo shell burning , we generally found it necessary to perform the merger very late in the growth of the sdb core , but before the helium burning had completely finished .",
    "this avoids having to ignite helium degenerately , though we still regularly found steep and numerically troublesome increases in the nuclear energy generation rate as we added the matter from the he wd . during the merger process",
    ", we artificially switched off the nuclear evolution of the object ( the energy generation continued as normal but the composition was frozen ) . to some extent , this enabled us to add the mass as slowly as was required for our models to converge ; we typically added mass at a rate that was over an order of magnitude smaller than the eddington - limited accretion rate .",
    "although the initial thermal structure of these objects will not be a perfect match to that of the actual merger products , it will adjust itself on a thermal timescale .",
    "hence we do not expect the subsequent nuclear evolution of the stars to be significantly affected .",
    "our 0.35 @xmath2 sdb stars are so cold and degenerate by the time that they have completely exhausted their core he that we could not follow mergers when starting from those structures .",
    "for these 0.35 @xmath2 objects , we were able to take less degenerate models ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the degeneracy parameter [ see , e.g. , kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ] ) with almost no core helium ( @xmath7 ) and set the core helium fraction to zero by hand .",
    "we could then add matter to the surface of these objects and follow the helium burning and subsequent evolution .",
    "when we tried to perform mergers using stellar structures where the core helium had not been reduced to zero , convection currents were driven by the residual core helium burning , leading to significant mixing throughout the star .",
    "we investigated whether the age of the post sdb wd affected its post - merger evolution , i.e. whether the core temperature and degeneracy parameter @xmath6 at the time of the merger were significant .",
    "this is not easy to study faithfully as our calculations often fail to converge when the point of helium ignition has become even mildly degenerate ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , we adopted an artifical way to test this .",
    "for a merger product which was not degenerate enough to cause numerical problems , we switched off the nuclear evolution whilst allowing the helium - burning energy generation to continue .",
    "we then forcibly cooled the core as much as possible . for lower helium wd masses ( e.g. 0.2 and 0.25 @xmath2 )",
    ", we were able to reach core temperatures as low as @xmath9 k , and in all cases below @xmath10 k. the initial core temperature appeared to have no discernible effect on the long - term evolution of the merger product once the artificial cooling was removed ; the core temperature increased again due to heat flowing inwards from the burning shell .",
    "we also note that compressional heating of the accreting star during the merger should reduce the degeneracy of the merger products compared to our hydrostatic calculations , potentially further reducing any small effect of the core temperature at the time of the merger .",
    "however , we can not guarantee that this effect can be totally ignored ; similar calculations have been performed by iben ( 1990 ) , who argued that the prior thermal history of the core was not negligible in the evolution of the post - merger star .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : logg_tracks ] and [ fig : hr_and_times ] .",
    "the majority of the helium - burning phase of the merger products is spent close to the majority of known he - sdo stars in the effective temperature  surface gravity diagram .",
    "this is particularly true for mergers of the 0.35@xmath11 post - sdb stars .",
    "furthermore , the trend from the 0.4 to 0.35@xmath11 models suggests that the lowest mass sdb stars in the population ( @xmath12 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : initdist ] ) might help to fill in the low - temperature end of the distribution .",
    "pronounced helium - giant phases are experienced late in the evolution of the merger products when the total mass exceeds @xmath13  m@xmath4 , in agreement with the behaviour described by trimble & paczynski ( 1974 ) for low - mass he stars .",
    "[ fig : lhist ]      we have generated a library of evolutionary sequences for post - sdb + he wd merger products , as described in the previous section .",
    "we then combined that library with the sdb population predictions by han et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to simulate the characteristic properties of the expected population of single he - rich sdo stars from this merger channel .",
    "figure [ fig : bps ] compares the results of such a population synthesis simulation to the properties of observed he - rich sdo stars from stroeer et al .",
    "we show the results for two assumptions : one where all of the he wd is accreted by the post - sdb star and one where 0.1 @xmath2 of the he wd is lost from the system , to take into account possible systemic mass loss or the formation of a disc around the merger product ; a real population is likely to have a more complicated combination of conservative and non - conservative mass - transfer histories .",
    "the correspondence between our models and the observations is quite good , especially when we apply a correction to mimic the effects of small amounts of hydrogen in the atmospheres of the sdo stars .",
    "our initial sdb models were completely hydrogen - free .",
    "however , even a thin hydrogen envelope layer significantly changes the appearance of a hot subdwarf ( han et al .",
    "2002 ) , making it cooler and reducing its surface gravity . to take this into account , fig .",
    "[ fig : bps ] shows the population synthesis results both with and without an ad - hoc correction for trace amounts of hydrogen , as estimated from figure 2 of han et al .",
    "we chose to uniformly spread each system in the @xmath14@xmath15 plane over a range given by the vector @xmath16 k in @xmath17 and 0.3 in @xmath15 . , i.e. we assumed a uniform spread in h content from zero to @xmath18",
    "in reality , both the magnitude and direction of this vector should change slightly with effective temperature . ]",
    "we note that stroeer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that he - rich sdo stars show higher carbon and nitrogen abundances than other sdo stars .",
    "this seems consistent with our proposed formation channel , as mixing during the merger phase could mix out material from the core of the post - sdb star . however ,",
    "the effect of these surface abundance changes has not completely been taken into account in our stellar evolution calculations .",
    "these abundances may also affect the atmospheric modelling of these stars ( e.g. lanz et al .",
    "2004 & stephan geier , priv .  comm . ) , hence some of the parameters of the observed he - sdo stars may change as the atmospheric models improve .",
    "it seems likely that our model could , in principle , account for most of the he - sdos above the helium main sequence .",
    "however , several he - sdos below the he main sequence can apparently only be accommodated by our simulations if their surface gravities decreased as a result of improved atmosphere calculations ; the work of hirsch & heber ( 2009 ) suggests that such an adjustment is very likely to occur .",
    "we now estimate the birthrate of single he - rich sdos , using the binary population synthesis calculations of han et al .",
    "the formation channel which produces sdb stars in close binaries with helium wds is their ` second common - envelope channel ' ( ce2 ) .",
    "their two common - envelope channels produce the sdb stars known to be in close binaries , which constitute about half of the known systems ( we will denote the fraction of sdb stars which are in close binaries as @xmath19 ) . for their model population which best fits the galaxy ,",
    "the ce2 birthrate is @xmath20 and the ce1 birthrate is @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22% of the close binary sdbs come from the ce2 channel .",
    "however , for the common - envelope parameters used in their preferred model , only @xmath23% of the binaries produced via the ce2 channel are close enough to merge within 10 gyr .",
    "this requires a post - common - envelope period @xmath24 hr , assuming that gravitational wave radiation is the only angular - momentum loss mechanism and taking representative component masses of 0.35 & 0.45 @xmath2 . ]",
    "hence we estimate the birthrate in the galaxy of he - rich sdos ( @xmath25 ) to be @xmath26% of the birthrate of close binary sdbs ( @xmath27 ) .    given the birthrates , we can estimate the relative number of sdb and he - sdo stars using their respective lifetimes .",
    "for the he - sdo population , we find a mean lifetime ( @xmath28 ) of @xmath29 10 myr and , for sdb stars , we adopt the canonical lifetime @xmath30 myr . the number of stars in the he - rich sdo population , @xmath31 ,",
    "is then related to the number of sdb stars , @xmath32 , according to @xmath33 i.e. , using the estimates above , @xmath34 thus , there should be @xmath35 times as many sdb stars as he - rich sdo stars in the _ intrinsic _ population . however , since he - rich sdos are on average much brighter , this need to be corrected for the different potential detection volumes in order to be able to derive an estimate for the relative number in the _ observed _ sample .",
    "figure [ fig : lhist ] shows the luminosity distribution of the predicted he - sdo population . while a representative luminosity for a sdb star is @xmath36",
    "l@xmath4 ( han et al .  2003 ) , the mean luminosity of the he - sdo population is @xmath37  @xmath38 ( see figure [ fig : lhist ] ) .",
    "this gives a relative detection volume of @xmath39 .",
    "this estimate implies that there should be one he - sdo star known for every @xmath40 sdb stars .",
    "this is clearly a very approximate number .",
    "it assumes that we know both the number of systems produced by the ce2 formation channel and the fraction of those systems which have short enough periods to merge within a hubble time .",
    "uncertainties in the ce2 channel include the treatment of common - envelope evolution itself , the extent to which the first mass transfer phase is non - conservative and the criterion for dynamically unstable mass transfer",
    ".    however , our estimate for the relative numbers of he - rich sdos and sdb stars seems to be a reasonable match to the observations .",
    "we are not aware of samples that can be compared precisely , but stroeer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) list 33 he - rich sdo stars ; in a companion paper , lisker et al .",
    "( 2005 ) state that over 200 sdb stars have been ` analysed for atmospheric parameters ' .",
    "heber ( 2008 ) increases that number to ` several hundred ' sdb stars .",
    "the palomar - green survey ( green , schmidt & liebert 1986 ) found @xmath41 1 he - sdo for every 4 sdbs .",
    "there seems to be little doubt that he - wd+he - wd mergers ( saio & jeffery 2000 ) and he - wd+post - sdb mergers ( this work ) both happen .",
    "the potential difference between the outcomes of those events is worth examining .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) and han ( 2008 ) have argued that double he - wd mergers can explain single _ h - rich _ sdb stars , whilst here we argue that he - wd+post - sdb mergers can produce _ h - poor _ he - sdo stars .",
    "the difference between the atmospheres of sdb and sdo stars should be able to account for this .",
    "groth , kudritzki & heber ( 1985 ) examined the occurence of convection zones in hot subdwarf stars as a function of temperature and composition ; they argued that the atmospheres of helium - rich sdo stars should be convective , whilst those of helium - poor sdos and sdb stars are mostly radiative ( see also heber [ 2009 ] ) .",
    "hence gravitational settling can operate in most sdb stars  producing he - poor photospheres  but not in he - sdos .",
    "the effective temperatures of the merger products thereby determine which remain he - rich ; the cooler merger products experience settling .",
    "the majority of he - wd mergers simulated in han et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are significantly cooler than the merger products in fig .",
    "[ fig : bps ] , consistent with the he - wd mergers producing h - rich sdbs and the merger channnel proposed in this work producing he - sdos .",
    "however , if that explanation is correct then the hotter he - wd mergers may also contribute to the he - sdo population .",
    "in addition , note that the boundary between the atmospheric regimes found by groth et al .",
    "is more complex than simply a division between sdo and sdb stars ; in particular , their calculations found that the temperature boundary which allows a convective atmosphere becomes cooler at lower surface gravities .",
    "hence we should also expect some he - sdb stars to be produced by he - rich merger products which have convective atmospheres but are cool enough to be sdb stars .",
    "this would be helpful to our model , since it seems that our merger products are too hot to explain he - sdb stars .",
    "naslim et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have stressed that it is logical to consider the evolutionary status of he - sdb and he - sdo stars together ; our merger scenario seems to require a second population to explain the he - sdbs : potentially some he - wd mergers account for the he - sdbs as well as for the some of the he - sdos .",
    "one outstanding and , as yet , unexplained piece of evidence is the observation that he - sdos come in both nitrogen - rich and carbon - rich classes , with a further subset enhanced in both c and n , whilst he - poor sdos are not c or n rich ( stroeer et al .",
    "if some he - wd mergers produce he - sdos ( perhaps , e.g. , the more massive he - wd mergers ) then they might conceivably produce one composition subclass whilst the he - wd+post - sdb mergers produce another subclass .",
    "saio & jeffery ( 2000 ) argue that the outcome of their double he - wd merger model could have cno - processed material at the surface ( i.e. n - rich ) , whilst saio & jeffery ( 2002 ) produce a c - rich star from their he - wd+co - wd merger ( _ not _ a he - sdo ) .",
    "our merger model is somewhere between those examples ; it is not clear which range of surface abundances our merger scenario might produce .",
    "the phase of accretion and ignition seems likely to be important for imprinting the surface carbon and nitrogen abundances of he - sdos ; we encourage future work to investigate this detail .",
    "the model described by this paper so far can explain the population of observed single he - rich sdo stars quite well . however , there are two known _",
    "double _ he - rich hot subdwarf stars , i.e. binaries where both components are he - sdo or he - sdb stars .",
    "interestingly , both of these systems contain two hot subdwarfs that appear to be he - rich .",
    "the best published example of such a system is pg 1544 + 488 ( ahmad et al .  2004 ) , which contains two he - rich hot subdwarf stars . the published mass ratio for that system is @xmath42 , though recent data may bring this value closer to 1 ( simon jeffery , priv .  comm . ) .",
    "the orbital period is 0.48 d. lisker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also report the existence of a system containing two ` very similar ' he - rich sdo stars ( he 0301 - 3039 ; see also stroeer et al 2007 ) .    a second formation channel is needed to explain these systems",
    ": we suggest that these systems are the products of a double - core common - envelope ( ce ) phase ( e.g. brown 1995 ; belczynski & kalogera 2001 ; dewi , podsiadlowski & sena 2006 ) .",
    "double - core ce evolution is a special case of common - envelope evolution where the envelopes of _ both _ stars in a binary are simultaneously ejected as both stellar cores spiral inwards inside an envelope produced by the union of their envelopes .",
    "this produces a close binary containing the exposed cores of both original stars ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : double_core_schematic ] ) .",
    "the onset of double - core evolution , should it occur , is not driven by the classical dynamical mass - tranfer instability , since the initial mass ratio of the two binary components has to be close to one , which generally leads to dynamically stable mass transfer . however , mass transfer onto the secondary , which is already trying to expand as a [ sub-]giant , causes it to swell further . both stars",
    "are then trying to overfill their roche lobes , leading to the spiral - in and ultimately the ejection of the shared envelope .",
    "double - core evolution has not been proven to exist in nature . however",
    ", if it is responsible for the production of double hot subdwarf binaries , then this may have potentially important implications for the production of double neutron - star binaries through an analogous channel ( e.g.  dewi et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the parameter space which is expected to lead to double - core ce evolution is quite small .",
    "the two stars in the binary must have almost equal initial masses , as the secondary must have already left the main sequence by the time the primary fills its roche lobe whilst the primary should fill its roche lobe before the tip of the first giant branch . in order to form two hot subdwarfs , there is a further constraint : both stars must be able to ignite helium .",
    "the consequence of this constraint depends on the initial mass of the stars ; there are two regimes which divide approximately into whether the secondary ignites helium degenerately or non - degenerately",
    ".    if the secondary is to ignite helium degenerately , its core mass must be within @xmath41 5% of the core mass at the tip of the giant branch when the envelope is removed ( han et al .",
    "this requirement also applies at the lower end of the mass range when non - degenerate ignition is possible .",
    "the likelihood of both components being within this range at contact is almost negligible , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : doublecore ] , which quantifies the parameter constraints for this channel .",
    "if we neglect the unlikely possibility that the secondary ignites helium degenerately , both components will be igniting helium non - degenerately . according to han et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , stars more massive than 2.265 @xmath2 will , at solar metallicity , ignite helium non - degenerately even if they lose their envelopes in the hertzsprung gap . ; hence adopting a lower metallicity seems likely to increase the birthrate from this channel . ]",
    "this allows a wider range of parameter space to potentially produce double - hot - subdwarf systems .",
    "figure [ fig : doublecore ] shows the width of the non - degenerate double - core channel . at the lower end of this mass range , the mass of the secondary has to be within @xmath43% of the mass of the primary , declining to @xmath44% .",
    "this is narrow but not completely negligible . if we make the standard assumption that the probability distribution of mass ratios is @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 ) , then , for non - degenerate ignition , around 1% of systems in the first common - envelope channel from han et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) meet this criterion . however in the preferred population model of han et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , only @xmath297% of the close sdb binaries are produced via non - degenerate ignition in the first ce channel .",
    "assuming that half of the known sdbs are in close binaries , then only one double - core system is born for every @xmath413000 normal sdbs .",
    "if that estimate is correct , then the birthrate from this channel seems somewhat lower than would comfortably account for seeing two such systems amongst several hundred known sdb stars .",
    "however , the two known systems consitute a very small sample size , and we do not attempt to account for observational selection effects .",
    "figure [ fig : doublecore ] also shows that hot subdwarf systems produced from this channel should have mass ratios @xmath47 , based on the ratio of allowed core masses.complete h - exhaustion ) , which is somewhat approximate for intermediate - mass stars at the end of the main sequence .",
    "]    a third possibility is that the core of the secondary star does not ignite helium at all .",
    "then the observed system would not contain two he - burning stars , but one he - burning star and one post - rgb star that is simply a hot young wd , cooling towards the main wd cooling sequence ( hd 188112 seems to be an example of such a non - he - burning hot subdwarf ; see , e.g. , heber et al .",
    "2003 ; stroeer et al .",
    "the lifetime of this cooling phase is short ( @xmath48 myr , depending on its mass ; driebe et al .",
    "1998 ; heber et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it seems unlikely to us that the non - he - burning secondary would resemble the primary for long enough to reproduce the systems we are considering here , but this possibility can not be totally excluded .",
    "the double - core ce evolution channel outlined above is not the only possible way to make a binary containing two hot subdwarfs .",
    "rappaport et al .  (",
    "2009 ) have outlined the evolutionary past and future of the spectroscopic binary regulus ( @xmath49 leonis ) . the current low - mass ( @xmath41 0.3 @xmath2 ) component could potentially be a very low - mass sdb star . in one of the possible paths for the future evolution of the system , the core of regulus ( the current main - sequence star with mass @xmath41 3.4 @xmath2 ) is exposed as a second sdb star , of mass @xmath41 0.5 @xmath2 . in such a scenario ,",
    "the lower - mass sdb star could easily be still burning helium after the second one has been formed .",
    "if the current low - mass star did not manage to ignite helium , then a system with only marginally different initial conditions should be able to do so .",
    "the regulus - like systems would produce a hot subdwarf binary with a mass ratio far from unity ( @xmath50 ) , similar to the published mass ratio of pg 1544 + 488 .",
    "there may well be even more channels which can produce double hot subdwarfs as binary evolution allows for a rich range of possibilities .",
    "however , the double - core channel tends to produce systems with mass ratios approaching one with minimal appeal to fine - tuning .",
    "in addition , one distinguishing feature of both pg 1544 + 488 and he 0301 - 3039 is that they seem to be he - rich . for a regulus - like channel",
    "it is not so obvious why this should produce abnormal sdb stars , as they are simply a combination of normal formation channels .",
    "hence it seems reasonable to ask whether double - core evolution might somehow tend to produce he - rich subdwarfs .",
    "as explained above , the double - core channel strongly favours non - degenerate helium ignition and hence intermediate - mass stars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : doublecore ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : compositionprofile ] shows that , during the relevant portion of their evolution , intermediate - mass stars can have extended regions outside their cores which have high helium abundances , whilst low - mass stars do not .",
    "this seems to provide a natural reason why the known double subdwarf stars are he - rich .",
    "if intermediate - mass stars tend to produce he - rich hot subdwarfs , then the mass distribution of that subdwarf population should be less strongly peaked than the general sdb population .",
    "this is because those sudwarfs from intermediate - mass stars can ignite helium non - degenerately , unlike those low - mass stars which experience the helium flash .",
    "we have calculated the evolution of post - sdb wd stars after they have accreted from ( or merged with ) a helium wd companion .",
    "these stars burn helium in a shell around the core , but spend a large part of their evolution with properties mainly determined by the sdb mass .",
    "their later radius evolution is mainly determined by the mass of helium gained from their wd companions .",
    "the only major uncertainty in our modelling is in the treatment of the merger phase and the degenerate he ignition , but the merger calculations of saio & jeffery ( 2000 , 2002 ) seem to support our assumptions .",
    "this demonstrates that one of the major binary channels for the formation of sdb stars considered by han et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) _ predicts _ objects which resemble he - rich sdo stars .",
    "this subset of sdo stars ` can not be explained with canonical single star evolutionary models ' ( stroeer et al .",
    "an extension of this model could include mergers of he wds with other low - mass co wds ; however , massive sdb stars which leave remnants resembling normal - mass co wds probably do not produce he - sdos ( see saio & jeffery 2002 ) .",
    "he - sdos produced by this scenario have relatively high luminositites compared to sdb stars , which may help to distinguish between this and alternative scenarios ( e.g. saio & jeffery 2000 ; miller bertolami et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "more speculatively , we have also argued that systems containing two hot subdwarfs ( e.g. , pg 1544 + 488 , ahmad et al .",
    "2004 ; he 0301 - 3039 , lisker et al .",
    "2004 ) could form through double - core common - envelope evolution .",
    "this generally requires that the subdwarfs have similar masses and favours intermediate - mass progenitors .",
    "since intermediate - mass giants have a rather different chemical profile , this may also naturally explain why hot subdwarfs in these systems are preferentially he - rich .",
    "we thank the participants at the bamberg & shanghai hot subdwarf conferences for enjoyable discussions , in particular stephan geier , uli heber , simon jeffery , gijs nelemans & roy stensen .",
