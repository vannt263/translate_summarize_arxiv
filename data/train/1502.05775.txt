    "information - theoretic ( it ) or unconditional security  widely acknowledged as the strictest notion of security has witnessed a renaissance since the 90 s , arguably following maurer s seminal work on secret key ( sk ) agreement by public discussion from correlated source sequences @xcite , @xcite .",
    "compared to computational complexity - based approaches , it - security provides a framework for _ provable security _ by bounding the adversary s total information .",
    "assumptions are made neither on the latter s computational or memory resources nor on the unproven computational hardness of certain problems . by harnessing noise and appropriate coding and signaling strategies at the _ physical layer _ ( the lowest layer in the protocol stack ) , it - security potentially complements conventional upper layer cryptographic protocols ( e.g. , rsa , diffie - hellman key exchange ) and is an important component of future communication networks @xcite .",
    "the paradigm is especially valuable for improving security in large - scale wireless networks and distributed networks with minimal infrastructure ( e.g. , mobile _ ad hoc _ sensor networks ) where the broadcast nature of the transmission medium makes it particularly vulnerable to attacks , and key distribution and management is difficult and computationally expensive @xcite .",
    "but for all its advantages , unconditionally secure key distribution is impossible to realize from scratch , for instance , if the legitimate parties are only given access to a noiseless public communication channel @xcite .",
    "this pessimism can however be relativized if the parties are additionally given access to simple auxiliary devices ( e.g. , noisy correlations or communication channels ) that are not completely under the control of an adversary @xcite .",
    "thus , information - theoretic reductions between such primitives are of great interest .",

    "in general , there are irreversible losses in exchanging noisy correlations in that , going from one noisy correlation to another and back is not lossless ( even asymptotically ) @xcite . in light of the resource character of noisy correlations in enabling sk agreement , and that of sk in simulating a tripartite correlation , quantifying such resources are of interest .    to make things precise , consider three distant parties , honest alice and bob , and an adversary eve who observe sequences @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 respectively , where the sequence triple @xmath3 has the generic component variables @xmath4 . starting with no initially shared sks , and using only local operations and unlimited public communication ( lopc ) over a noiseless , authenticated ( but , otherwise insecure ) channel , what is the maximum rate at which alice and bob can distil a sk ( i.e. , the maximum possible _ sk rate _ ) , such that eve s information ( @xmath5 and the entire public discussion ) about the generated sk is arbitrarily small ?",
    "conversely , starting with perfect sks , what is the _ sk cost _ of approximately simulating the correlated triple @xmath6 using only lopc ?",
    "we explore this duality between the secrecy extractable from @xmath7 and that required to simulate @xmath7 in light of a similar well - known operational duality between the two notions of common information ( ci ) due to gcs and krner @xcite and wyner @xcite .",

    "conversion of @xmath178 and @xmath184 is possible iff @xmath261 , i.e. , iff @xmath262 and @xmath263 . in theorem 3 , we have given necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving the second equality . more generally , monotones can be used to derive upper bounds on the asymptotic rate of conversion of @xmath178 to any other distribution @xmath264 ( e.g. , one which is relatively less favorable to eve ) .",
