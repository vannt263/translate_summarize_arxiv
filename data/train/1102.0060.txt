    "the drell - yan process  @xcite , in which a charged lepton pair is produced in a hadron - hadron interaction via the electromagnetic @xmath0 process , has provided unique information on parton distributions . in particular , the drell - yan process has been used to determine the antiquark contents of nucleons and nuclei  @xcite , as well as the quark distributions of pions , kaons , and antiprotons  @xcite .",
    "such information is difficult , if not impossible , to obtain from dis experiments .",
    "as the drell - yan process can be well described by next - to - leading order qcd calculations  @xcite , a firm theoretical framework exists for utilizing the drell - yan process to extract the parton distributions .    during the last two decades , a series of fixed - target dimuon production experiments ( e772 , e789 , e866 ) have been carried out using 800 gev / c proton beam at fermilab . at 800 gev / c ,",
    "the dimuon data contain drell - yan continuum up to dimuon mass of @xmath1 gev as well as quarkonium productions ( j/@xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 resonances ) . the drell - yan process and quarkonium productions often provide complementary information , since drell - yan is an electromagnetic process via quark - antiquark annihilation while the quarkonium production is a strong interaction process dominated by gluon - gluon fusion at this beam energy .",
    "the fermilab dimuon experiments covers a broad range of physics topics .",
    "the drell - yan data have provided informations on the antiquark distributions in the nucleons  @xcite and nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these results showed the surprising results that the antiquark distributions in the nuclei are not enhanced  @xcite , contrary to the predictions of models which explain the emc effect in term of nuclear enhancement of exchanged mesons .",
    "moreover , the drell - yan cross section ratios @xmath5 clearly establish the flavor asymmetry of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 distributions in the proton , and they map out the @xmath8-dependence of this asymmetry  @xcite",
    ". pronounced nuclear dependences of quarkonium productions have been observed for j/@xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 resonances  @xcite .",
    "several review articles covering some of these results are available  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we will focus on the recent results from experiment e866 and future prospect of dimuon experiments at fermilab and j - parc .",
    "in the cern na51  @xcite and fermilab e866  @xcite experiments on proton - induced dimuon production , a striking difference was observed for the drell - yan cross sections between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "as the underlying mechanism for the drell - yan process involves quark - antiquark annihilation , this difference has been attributed to the asymmetry between the up and down sea quark distributions in the proton . from the @xmath11 ratios",
    "the bjorken-@xmath8 dependence of the sea - quark @xmath12 flavor asymmetry has been extracted  @xcite .     at @xmath13 of 500 gev using various pdfs . ]",
    "future fixed - target dimuon experiments have been proposed at the 120 gev fermilab main injector ( fmi ) and the 50 gev j - parc facilities .",
    "the fermilab proposal  @xcite , e906 , has been approved and is expected to start data - taking around 2011 . two dimuon proposals ( p04  @xcite and p24  @xcite )",
    "have also been submitted to the j - parc for approval .",
    "the lower beam energies at fmi and j - parc present opportunities for extending the @xmath14 and the nuclear antiquark distribution measurements to larger @xmath8 ( @xmath15 ) . for given values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the drell - yan cross section is proportional to @xmath18 , hence a gain of @xmath19 times in the drell - yan cross sections can be obtained at the j - parc energy of 50 gev . since the perturbative process gives a symmetric @xmath20 while non - perturbative processes are necessary to generate an asymmetric @xmath20 sea , it would be very important to extend the drell - yan measurements to kinematic regimes beyond the current limits .",
    "another advantage of lower beam energies is that a much more sensitive study of the partonic energy loss in nuclei could be carried out using the drell - yan nuclear dependence  @xcite .    to disentangle the @xmath12 asymmetry from the possible charge - symmetry violation effect  @xcite",
    ", one could consider @xmath21 boson production in @xmath22 collision at rhic . an interesting quantity to be measured is the ratio of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 cross sections  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that this ratio is very sensitive to @xmath12 .",
    "an important feature of the @xmath21 production asymmetry in @xmath22 collision is that it is completely free from the assumption of charge symmetry .",
    "another advantage of @xmath21 production in @xmath9 collision is that no nuclear effects need to be considered .",
    "finally , the @xmath21 production is sensitive to @xmath20 flavor asymmetry at a @xmath25 scale of @xmath26 6500 gev@xmath27c@xmath28 , significantly larger than all existing measurements .",
    "this offers the opportunity to examine the qcd evolution of the sea - quark flavor asymmetry .",
    "figure 1 shows the predictions  @xcite for @xmath22 collision at @xmath29gev .",
    "the mrs s0@xmath30 corresponds to the @xmath31 symmetric parton distributions , while the other three parton distribution functions are from recent global fits with asymmetric @xmath14 sea - quark distributions .",
    "figure 1 clearly shows that @xmath21 asymmetry measurements at rhic could provide an independent determination of @xmath12 .",
    "first results from the lhc are also expected soon , and will provide additional information  @xcite .",
    "unlike the electromagnetic drell - yan process , quarkonium production is a strong interaction dominated by the subprocess of gluon - gluon fusion at 800 gev beam energy .",
    "therefore , the quarkonium production cross sections are primarily sensitive to the gluon distributions in the colliding hadrons .",
    "the @xmath4 production ratio , @xmath32 , is expected to probe the gluon content in the neutron relative to that in the proton  @xcite .",
    "cross section ratios for @xmath4 resonances as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding ratios for drell - yan cross sections are also shown .",
    "the error bars are statistical only . ]",
    "the @xmath33 ratios for @xmath34 production are shown in fig .   2 as a function of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "these ratios are consistent with unity , in striking contrast to the corresponding values for the drell - yan process , also shown in fig .   2 .",
    "the difference between the drell - yan and the @xmath4 cross section ratios clearly reflect the different underlying mechanisms in these two processes . for @xmath4 production",
    ", the dominance of the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess at this beam energy implies that @xmath35 .",
    "figure 2 shows that the gluon distributions in the proton ( @xmath36 ) and neutron ( @xmath37 ) are very similar over the @xmath17 range @xmath38 .",
    "the overall @xmath39 ratio , integrated over the measured kinematic range , is @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath4 data indicate that the gluon distributions in the proton and neutron are very similar .",
    "the upcoming fermilab e906 experiment is expected to provide a precise measurement of the @xmath41 ratio .",
    "these data should further test the equality of the gluon distributions in the proton and neutron .",
    "moreover , these data could identify emc effects for deuteron .",
    "it is interesting to note that analogous ratios measured in dis and the drell - yan can not be used to determine the emc effects for deuteron , since different parton distributions are being probed for the hydrogen and the deuterium targets .",
    "if one assumes that the gluon distributions are identical in proton and neutron , then any deviation of the @xmath41 ratio from unity would be attributed to the emc effects of gluon distributions in deuteron .",
    "despite a quarter century of significant experimental and theoretical effort , the specific origins of the observed @xmath42 dependence of the nuclear quark distributions have yet to be unambiguously identified .",
    "attempts to explain the emc effect have led to a large collection of theoretical models  @xcite , many of which are capable of describing the essential features of the data , however the underlying physics mechanisms in each model are often very different .",
    "a new calculation of the modifications of nucleon quark distributions in the nuclear medium has recently been reported  @xcite . in this approach by clot , bentz and thomas ( cbt )",
    ", the nambu  jona - lasinio model is used to describe the coupling of the quarks in the bound nucleons to the scalar and vector mean fields inside a nucleus .",
    "these nucleon quark distributions are then convoluted with a nucleon momentum distribution in the nucleus to generate the nuclear quark distributions  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of this model is that for @xmath43 nuclei ( where @xmath44 and @xmath45 refer to the number of neutrons and protons ) the isovector ",
    "vector mean field ( usually denoted by @xmath46 ) will affect the up quarks differently from the down quarks in the bound nucleons .",
    "therefore , this model has a novel prediction that the @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks have distinct nuclear modifications for @xmath43 nuclei .",
    "semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) on heavy nuclear targets , in which the flavor of the struck quark is tagged by the detected hadron , is a promising experimental tool to search for the flavor - dependent emc effect .",
    "recently , lu and ma  @xcite pointed out that charged lepton sidis off nuclear targets and the deuteron can be used to probe the flavor content of the nuclear quark sea , which can help distinguish between the various models of the emc effect .",
    "indeed , a sidis experiment  @xcite aiming at a precise determination of flavor dependence of the emc effect has also been proposed at the upgraded @xmath49gev jlab facility .",
    "( upper left ) , @xmath50 ( upper right ) and @xmath51 ( lower ) versus the predictions using nuclear pdfs of the cbt model for tungsten ( red solid ) and @xmath52 nuclear matter ( blue dashed ) . ]",
    "the flavor dependence of the emc effect is a promising experimental observable to distinguish among the plethora of models that can describe the emc effect . as discussed earlier",
    ", the nuclear dependence of proton - induced drell - yan process measured at fermilab has shown the surprising results that the antiquark distributions in the nuclei are not enhanced  @xcite , contrary to the predictions of many emc models .",
    "pion - induced drell - yan process provides another experimental tool with which search for flavor - dependent effects in the nuclear modification of the nucleon structure functions  @xcite .    to explore the sensitivity of pion - induced drell - yan processes to a flavor - dependent emc effect",
    ", we consider the three ratios @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath42 represents a nuclear , d a deuteron and h a hydrogen target . assuming isospin symmetry , which implies @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and keeping only the dominant terms in each cross - section , one readily obtains    @xmath60",
    "@xmath61    @xmath62    the up and down nuclear quark distributions are labeled by @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively , @xmath65 is the up quark distribution in the deuteron and @xmath66 the up quark distribution in the proton .",
    "eqs . 1 - 3",
    "demonstrate that these drell - yan cross - section ratios are very sensitive to the flavor dependence of the emc effect .",
    "3 shows the comparison  @xcite of the calculations of the pion - induced drell - yan cross - section ratios with the existing data .",
    "the top left panel shows the ratio of @xmath67 from the na10 experiment  @xcite .",
    "these plots contain both the @xmath68 and @xmath69gev data sets , which are very similar .",
    "the calculations are performed at @xmath70gev , since most of the data was obtained at this energy .",
    "the pdfs of the cbt model  @xcite at a fixed @xmath25 of @xmath71gev @xmath28 , which is approximately the mean @xmath25 of the na10 experiment , were used .",
    "the top right panel shows the ratio @xmath72 from the na3 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the data were collected using a @xmath73gev @xmath74 beam and the @xmath25 range covered was @xmath75gev@xmath28 .",
    "the calculations are performed for @xmath76gev and @xmath77gev@xmath28 .    the solid curves in fig . 3 are calculations using the flavor - dependent @xmath78 and @xmath79 from the cbt model with @xmath80 , corresponding approximately to the @xmath81 values for the au , w and pt nuclei .",
    "the dashed curves correspond to the calculated ratios using the nuclear pdfs from the cbt model for @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath82 in this case , the dashed curves are representative of the predictions for flavor - independent emc models .",
    "figure 3 shows that the na10 data do not exhibit a clear preference for the flavor - dependent versus flavor - independent nuclear pdfs .",
    "in contrast , the na3 data strongly favor the calculations using flavor - dependent nuclear pdfs .",
    "the existing drell - yan data are not sufficiently accurate yet , although the na3 data clearly favor the flavor - dependent over the flavor - independent nuclear pdfs .",
    "precise future pion - induced drell - yan experiments can provide unique constraints that will help distinguish the various theoretical models and most importantly shed new light on the origins of the emc effect .",
    "the study of the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions of the nucleon has received much attention in recent years as it provides new perspectives on the hadron structure and qcd  @xcite .",
    "these novel tmds can be extracted from semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) experiments .",
    "recent measurements of the sidis by the hermes  @xcite and compass  @xcite collaborations have shown clear evidence for the existence of the t - odd sivers functions .",
    "these data also allow the first determination  @xcite of the magnitude and flavor structure of the sivers functions and the nucleon transversity distributions .",
    "the tmd and transversity parton distributions can also be probed in drell - yan experiments . as pointed out  @xcite long time ago , the double transverse spin asymmetry in polarized drell - yan , @xmath83 , is proportional to the product of transversity distributions , @xmath84 . the single transverse spin asymmetry , @xmath85 , is sensitive to the sivers function  @xcite , @xmath86 of the polarized proton ( beam or target ) .",
    "even unpolarized drell - yan experiments can be used to probe the tmd distribution function , since the cos@xmath87 azimuthal angular dependence is proportional to the product of two boer - mulders functions  @xcite , @xmath88 .",
    "a unique feature of the drell - yan process is that , unlike the sidis , no fragmentation functions are involved .",
    "therefore , the drell - yan process provides an entirely independent technique for measuring the tmd functions .",
    "furthermore , the proton - induced drell - yan process is sensitive to the sea - quark tmds and can lead to flavor separation of tmds when combined with the sidis data .",
    "finally , the intriguing prediction  @xcite that the t - odd tmds extracted from dis will have a sign - change for the drell - yan process remains to be tested experimentally .",
    "no polarized drell - yan experiments have yet been performed .",
    "however , some information on the boer - mulders functions have been extracted recently from the azimuthal angular distributions in the unpolarized drell - yan process .",
    "the general expression for the drell - yan angular distribution is  @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the polar and azimuthal decay angle of the @xmath92 in the dilepton rest frame .",
    "boer showed that the @xmath93 term is proportional to the convolution of the quark and antiquark boer - mulders functions in the projectile and target  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the drell - yan cross section depends on the transverse spins of the annihilating quark and antiquark .",
    "therefore , a correlation between the transverse spin and the transverse momentum of the quark , as represented by the boer - mulders function , would lead to a preferred transverse momentum direction .",
    "pronounced @xmath94 dependences were indeed observed in the na10  @xcite and e615  @xcite pion - induced drell - yan experiments , and attributed to the boer - mulders function .",
    "the first measurement of the @xmath94 dependence of the proton - induced drell - yan process was recently reported for @xmath9 and @xmath10 interactions at 800 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to pion - induced drell - yan , significantly smaller ( but non - zero ) cos@xmath87 azimuthal angular dependence was observed in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 reactions . while the pion - induced drell - yan process is dominated by annihilation between a valence antiquark in the pion and a valence quark in the nucleon , the proton - induced drell - yan process involves a valence quark in the proton annihilating with a sea antiquark in the nucleon .",
    "therefore , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 results suggest  @xcite that the boer - mulders functions for sea antiquarks are significantly smaller than those for valence quarks .",
    "future fixed - target dimuon experiments have been proposed at the 120 gev fermilab main injector and the 50 gev j - parc facilities . as discussed earlier",
    ", the fermilab e906 experiment will extend the @xmath20 asymmetry measurement to larger @xmath8 region .",
    "another goal of this experiment is to determine the antiquark distributions in nuclei at large @xmath8 using nuclear targets .",
    "new information on the quark energy loss in nuclei is also expected .",
    "as discussed earlier , an advantage of lower beam energies is that a much more sensitive study of the partonic energy loss in nuclei could be carried out  @xcite .    with the possibility to accelerate polarized proton beams at j - parc  @xcite , the spin structure of the proton",
    "can also be investigated with the proposed dimuon experiments .",
    "in particular , polarized drell - yan process with polarized beam and/or polarized target at j - parc would allow a unique program on spin physics complementary to polarized dis experiments and the rhic - spin programs .",
    "specific physics topics include the measurements of t - odd boer - mulders distribution function in unpolarized drell - yan , the extraction of t - odd sivers distribution functions in singly transversely polarized drell - yan , the helicity distribution of antiqaurks in doubly longitudinally polarized drell - yan , and the transversity distribution in doubly transversely polarized drell - yan .",
    "it is worth noting that polarized drell - yan is one of the major physics program at the gsi polarized antiproton experiment ( pax ) .",
    "the compass experiment at cern will also measure @xmath74-induced drell - yan on transversely polarized targets to extract sivers functions from the single - spin - asymmetry .",
    "two recent letter - of - intent have also been submitted to rhic for measuring polarized drell - yan at rhic - spin , one in collider mode and the other utilizing internal targets .",
    "it is clear that the drell - yan process will continue to provide unique information on parton distributions in the forseeable future .",
