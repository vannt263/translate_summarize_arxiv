    "the study of nonlinear optical phenomena arising from the collective motion of atoms in dynamic optical fields has been an active field of predominantly theoretical research over the last decade .",
    "a large fraction of this work has been concerned with the collective atomic recoil laser ( carl ) @xcite . as part of the continuing progress in the production and investigation of ultracold atomic gases and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) ,",
    "there have been several experiments which have demonstrated the validity of these models and realized some of their predictions .",
    "examples include the observation of collective atomic recoil lasing by a cold thermal gas in a high - finesse cavity @xcite and the observation of superradiant rayleigh scattering by a bec @xcite .",
    "superradiant rayleigh scattering involves the production of pulses of coherently scattered radiation simultaneous with the splitting of the condensate into discrete momentum groups due to atomic recoil .",
    "several theoretical models have been used to describe the evolution of the superradiant scattering process @xcite , including an extension of the original classical carl model @xcite to include a quantum treatment of the atomic dynamics @xcite .",
    "recent experimental work by schneble _",
    "@xcite has shown that in addition to the superradiant rayleigh scattering process originally observed in @xcite , there is a second scattering regime termed  kapiza - dirac scattering  . during superradiant rayleigh scattering ,",
    "the scattering process involves only emission of scattered photons i.e. absorption of pump photons and emission of scattered ( probe ) photons . in contrast , during kapiza - dirac scattering the scattering process involves both emission _ and absorption _ of scattered ( probe ) photons i.e. absorption of probe photons and emission of pump photons .    in this paper it is shown that many features of the recent experiments of schneble _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite can be described using a one - dimensional mean - field quantum carl model , where optical amplification occurs simultaneously with the production of a periodic density modulation in the atomic medium . using this model ,",
    "we demonstrate that the two regimes of `` kapiza - dirac scattering '' and `` superradiant rayleigh scattering '' observed in @xcite , can be interpreted as the semiclassical and quantum limits respectively of carl lasing .",
    "it will be shown that the two regimes are distinguished by the relative size of the gain of the superradiant scattering process and the frequency separation of the absorption and emission peaks . a significant difference between the results presented here and those of other theoretical models of the experiments of schneble _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is that in this model the regime of scattering is not determined by the pump pulse duration , so the scattering process does not evolve in time from one to the other .",
    "the model used to describe the bec - light interaction is the mean - field quantum - carl model originally derived in @xcite .",
    "the model is one - dimensional and describes the evolution of a backscattered ( probe ) field arising from scattering of a pump laser field ( assumed to be of constant amplitude ) by an elongated bec . in the experiments of schneble",

    "if we assume that coupling between the endfire modes ( which are much weaker than the pump ) is negligible , each endfire mode can be assumed to evolve independently and the atomic motion is one - dimensional .",
    "[ fig1 ]    when the pump laser is sufficiently detuned from the atomic resonance , it leaves the atoms in the internal ground state .",
    "consequently radiation pressure due to absorption and subsequent random incoherent , isotropic emission of a photon , can be neglected . in this detuned regime",
    ", coherent scattering of the pump laser is the dominant process .",

    "in @xcite , the kapiza - dirac scattering regime and the superradiant rayleigh scattering regime are described as the `` short - pump pulse '' and `` long - pump pulse '' limits respectively .",
    "a problem with this classification is that it implies that for sufficiently long pump pulses the collective scattering makes a transition from kapiza - dirac scattering to superradiant rayleigh scattering , or in the terminology of this paper a transition from the semiclassical to the quantum regime of carl lasing .",
    "the results presented here however do not support this interpretation .",
    "they suggest that the distinguishing feature between the two experiments in @xcite is not the pump pulse duration , but the atom - field detuning ( which differs by an order of magnitude in the experiments of @xcite ) , which determines the atom - field coupling and consequently the timescale of the superradiant scattering process . rather than the ratio of the pump pulse duration relative to the two - photon recoil time ( the inverse of the two - photon recoil frequency ) ,",
    "it is the size of the superradiant decay time relative to the two - photon recoil time which determines whether or not the scattering consists of a sequence of emission processes , as observed in the `` superradiant rayleigh scattering '' regime @xcite , or simultaneous emission and absorption processes , as observed in the `` kapiza - dirac regime '' .",
    "a simple justification for this argument is as follows : the atoms are assumed to all be in the condensate initially , so that @xmath123 .",
    "the frequencies at which the probability of absorption ( @xmath124 ) and emission ( @xmath125 ) are maximum are non - degenerate and differ by a frequency of @xmath126 .",
    "a transition from ( @xmath125 ) will initiate superradiant or superfluorescent decay .",
    "the characteristic time of the superradiant decay is @xmath127 for @xmath128 @xcite , so the spectral width of the superradiant pulse is @xmath129 .",
    "if the spectral width of the sr pulse is much less than the absorption - emission frequency shift i.e. @xmath130 , then absorptive transitions will not occur because they are non - resonant and only ( @xmath125 ) transitions , i.e. absorption of pump photons and emission of probe photons , will occur .",
    "consequently the system evolves in the quantum carl limit when @xmath131 .",
    "in contrast , if the spectral width of the sr pulse is sufficiently large ( i.e. sr decay is sufficiently rapid ) that it is much larger than the absorption - emission frequency difference , so that @xmath132 , then absorptive transitions ( @xmath124 ) will be resonant and both emission and re - absorption of probe photons will occur .",
    "consequently the system evolves in the semiclassical carl limit when @xmath65 .",
    "it should be noted that in contrast to previous explanations @xcite of the experimental results in @xcite , in our argument the duration of the pump pulse is not a significant factor .",
    "the reason that the semiclassical carl or `` kapiza - dirac '' regime can be observed using a short pump pulse in @xcite is because the timescale of semiclassical superradiant decay , @xmath133 ( see eq.([g2 ] ) ) is much shorter than in the `` superradiant rayleigh scattering '' example as a result of the decreased pump - atom detuning . in ref .",
    "@xcite a suppression of quantum sr gain @xmath51 of eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) by around two orders of magnitude was observed and attributed in @xcite to the short duration of the pump pulse .",
    "the carl model described here explains the reduced gain observed in @xcite as a result of the fact that the sr scattering process is evolving semiclassically .",
    "consequently the sr gain is not given by @xmath51 as given by eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) but the semiclassical sr gain @xmath134 as given by eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "the semiclassical gain , @xmath134 , gives a value consistently smaller than the one predicted by the quantum superradiant gain , @xmath51 .",
    "using the same parameters as those used in figs  [ srs_snaps ] and [ fielda ] , the ratio is @xmath135 .",
    "it has been shown that many features of the recent experiments of schneble _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which show two different regimes of light scattering by the bec , can be described using a one - dimensional mean - field quantum carl model .",
    "the two regimes of light scattering observed in @xcite , described as `` kapiza - dirac scattering '' and `` superradiant rayleigh scattering '' in @xcite , can be interpreted as the semiclassical and quantum limits respectively of carl lasing . in the semiclassical limit ,",
    "when @xmath136 , the collective scattering process involves both absorption and emission of probe photons , and for sufficiently long times many momentum states are populated simultaneously . in the quantum limit , however , when @xmath137 , the collective scattering process involves emission of probe photons only , and a maximum of two momentum states are populated at any time .",
    "we provide a simple explanation of these results in terms of a comparison between the frequency separation of probe emission and absorption events and the spectral width of superradiant decay between the initial and recoiling condensates .",
    "in contrast to previous models of the experiments in @xcite , the pump pulse duration is not a significant factor in our interpretation .",
    "the results presented here support the view of the bec - light interaction as a strongly coupled atom - optical system where the atoms and light ( and consequently the matter - wave and optical gratings ) evolve dynamically and self - consistently .",
    "this picture gives a more correct and complete description of the interaction than models in which the dynamics of either the atoms ( matter - wave grating ) or the optical fields ( optical grating ) are neglected .",
