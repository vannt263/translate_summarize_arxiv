    "one of these branches is the ` soft - photon approximation ' for ionization of atoms by an extreme - ultraviolet ( xuv ) attosecond pulse in the presence of a synchronized ( assisting ) infra - red ( ir ) laser - field @xcite . in the above",
    "mentioned works , however , the use of sfa implies that the interactions between the photoelectron and the ion are neglected .",
    "this includes both attosecond delays from the coulomb electron motion and correlation effects .",
    "the influence of the asymptotic coulomb potential , known as the laser - coulomb coupling , has been studied within the eikonal - volkov approximation ( eva ) @xcite , but also by full numerical simulations , c.f .",
    "experiments using laser - assisted photoionization by attosecond pulses have evidenced that such atomic effects are measurable as relative ` atomic delays ' observed from different initial orbitals of the atoms @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the delays , @xmath1 , can be separated as the sum of the wigner - like delay , @xmath2 , of the electron from the xuv photoionization process plus a universal contribution from the interaction with the ir field , called the continuum  continuum delay ( cc ) or coulomb - laser coupling delay , @xmath3 @xcite @xmath4 in our earlier work we demonstrated the validity of eq .",

    "common to all above mentioned approaches is that the photoelectron is assumed to transfer directly into the continuum after absorption of the xuv photon .",

    "it is , in principle , necessary to convolute the two - photon matrix elements over xuv and ir bandwidth , but such a procedure can be avoided if the ir field is assumed to be monochromatic @xcite . in contrast , phase effects from the field envelopes in _ below_-threshold two - photon ionization or on resonances in the continuum have been identified , c.f .  ref .",

    "while this single - active electron potential was originally designed to model strong - field physics with low - frequency laser fields , it was soon also implemented in the theoretical analysis of xuv attosecond pulse trains within the so - called rabitt scheme @xcite .",
    "as expected @xcite , the lack of correlation effects leads to quite poor agreement with the experimental data close to the ionization threshold of the one - photon xuv photoionization process .",
    "it is possible to optimize the pseudo - potential in order to better match the experimental cross - sections , as was done by mauritsson et al . in ref .",

    "the sheer efficiency of pseudo - potentials has made it possible to couple the atomic response of high - order harmonic generation to simulations using the maxwell wave equation @xcite .",
    "for more detailed atomic calculations , methods that include correlation effects consistently are required .",
    "recently , an ab initio time - dependent configuration interaction singles ( tdcis ) method has been developed to go beyond the single - active electron approximation in describing the interaction of strong fields with atoms @xcite . in a recent review article , based on the phd thesis of pabst @xcite ,",

    "we have verified that both inter - shell and intra - shell rpae calculations are in good agreement for ionization from the @xmath6-orbital , which is in contrast to the tdcis method that shows marked different results between inter - shell and intra - shell correlation . in this way",
    ", we suggest that it is the missing double - electron excitations , from the ground - state correlation of the rpae method , that is the source of discrepancy in the tdcis method .",
    "while early photoionization experiments were limited to measuring the total cross - section by detecting the total number of ions produced by the incident radiation , partial cross - sections are today accessible using photoelectron time - of - flight spectrometers @xcite .",
    "as predicted by amusia , the photoionization from outer @xmath27 subshells involves strong intershell correlation leading to a dramatic change in the partial cross - section @xcite . in fig .",

    "the many - body perturbation theory by chang @xcite and the multi - configuration hartree - fock method by saha @xcite give the best agreement with the experiment close to the cooper minimum @xcite .",
    "our results including correlation within the @xmath0-shell ( blue @xmath9 ) show similar good agreement for the position of the cooper minimum . at higher energies",
    "our calculations show an exaggerated cross - section , which was also observed using the mbpt ( in the length gauge ) and the mchf method .",
    "our implementation of the rpae method , as well as the recent work on attosecond delays by kheifets @xcite , contains all angular - momentum allowed transitions and is closely related to the mbpt calculations by chang @xcite .    when ground - state correlation effects are neglected from the @xmath10-photoionization process ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_diagcorr ] ) , we observe a large shift of the entire cross - section to higher energies by roughly @xmath29ev .",
    "interestingly , when we include also the @xmath30shell ( black @xmath11 ) , composed of @xmath31 and @xmath32 orbitals , we observe a small shift toward lower energies , away from the experimental data . to our knowledge , this inner - core effect has not been pointed out before .",
    "we have verified that the addition of k - shell correlation does not further modify the cross - section .",
    "in this section we describe in detail how attosecond time delays in photoionization from noble gas atoms can be computed using correlated two - photon ( xuv+ir ) above - threshold matrix elements @xcite .",
    "in fact , time is not a direct observable in quantum mechanics , so there is no straight - forward way to calculate time delays .",
    "the work presented here is of more pragmatic nature because we emulate directly how the experimental measurements are made rather than trying to assign it a specific physical interpretation .",
    "the `` delay in photoionization '' is measured experimentally by recording a spectrogram of photoelectrons as a function kinetic energy ( or momentum ) and the delay between the xuv field and the ir field .",
    "this means that the quantum mechanical observable is the probability for creating a photoelectron with a given energy ( or momentum ) in the presence of the fields .",
    "if the incident xuv field is an attosecond pulse train , then it consists of odd high - order harmonics of the ir field : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which can lead to the final sideband state with energy @xmath35 by absorption and emission of an additional ir photon , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig_photonpicture](a ) centre and right blocks ) . in this setup , which is called rabitt @xcite , the signal arises from interference between two different two - photon processes . if instead the incident xuv field is composed of both even and odd high - order harmonics , or of a continuous xuv spectra , then the so - called ( i)proof signal @xcite arises from interference between one - photon and two - photon matrix elements ( see fig .",

    "finally , the streak - camera signal , which can be interpreted as the result of classical motion of the electron in the fields @xcite , involves all such combinations of photon diagrams ( including also higher order processes ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite it is shown that all such photon paths suffer approximately the same phase - shift due to the two - photon matrix element , and so the atomic delay is universal for all methods . as we will show here , the quantitative delays do depend on how the electron detection is made ( energy or angle - resolved momentum ) .",
    "in addition , all photon - paths much be convoluted over the bandwidth of the xuv and ir fields .",
    "this can make the use of photon matrix elements time - consuming for numerical calculations , so we have assumed that the ir field is monochromatic . the frequency of the xuv photon",
    "is then determined , e.g. @xmath36 for the absorption path .",

    "a similar study of the delay peak from the @xmath6-orbital showed that rpae , rpa and tda all show negative delay peaks , independent of the level of correlation included .",

    "in fact , we also showed that the negative delay peak was reproduced using a single - active electron potential @xcite .",
    "further , a simple interpretation of the atomic delays observed close to autoionizing resonances was presented .",
    "the implications of this model was that the usual interpretation of atomic delay measurements breaks down when the ir photon energy is comparable or larger than the energy width of the atomic resonances .",
    "qualitative numerical results for the ar@xmath170 autoionizing rydberg series were used to confirm our prediction .",
