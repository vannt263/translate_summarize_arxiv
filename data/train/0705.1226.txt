    "classical field theories are a widespread and flexible tool for the study of many aspects of the physics of ultracold bose gases .",
    "developed in particular to address time - dependent problems related to dynamical aspects of the bose - einstein phase transition  @xcite they can also be used to study thermal equilibrium properties of the weakly interacting bose gas @xcite . a major example is the quantitative prediction of the shift of the bose - einstein condensation temperature due to atomic interactions  @xcite that has been obtained by means of a monte carlo sampling of a classical field model  @xcite : as long as the physics of the system is determined by the low - energy modes , classical field models provide reliable results on the full quantum problem .",
    "classical field techniques have also been applied to obtain analytical and numerical predictions for reduced dimensionality bose systems  @xcite , including the calculation of the critical temperature for the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "however , an ultraviolet cut - off has to be introduced in most of these classical field techniques in order to avoid ultraviolet divergences analogous to the blackbody catastrophe of classical statistical mechanics , and this raises the problem of a possible cut - off dependence of some of the physical results .    on the other side ,",
    "several exact reformulations of the many boson problem have been developed .",
    "although they have successfully served as a starting point for quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite of the thermal properties of bose systems such as liquid helium and ultracold atomic gases @xcite , they often lack the intuitiveness of classical field theories where the physics is described in terms of a simple distribution function in the functional space of c - number fields .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the development , the validation , and the first application of a _",
    "semi_-classical field theory which tries to combine a regular behavior in the ultraviolet limit with a transparent intuition of the physics of the system .",
    "as in classical field theories , the density matrix of the bose system is written in terms of a distribution in the space of c - number fields . in the semi - classical theory , this distribution is however much more complex than a simple boltzmann factor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 would be the gross - pitaevskii energy of the field configuration , and has to be obtained as the result of an imaginary - time gross - pitaevskii evolution starting from an initially uniform distribution in functional space .    a first application of the method is then presented to the study of thermal vortices in a homogeneous two - dimensional bose gas , in particular their density and their pair distribution function .",
    "experimentally , the two - dimensional bose gas has been realized some time ago  @xcite , but it is only recently that several experiments have given indications of the presence of vortices in finite temperature samples  @xcite , and this raises the question of the link between observable quantities ( e.g the vortex density ) , and theoretical concepts such as the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition  @xcite .",
    "most of the existing theoretical treatments neglect all density fluctuations other than the ones in the vicinity of a vortex core , and eventually map the 2d bose gas problem onto the xy model of statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "although this approximation is expected to provide a good description of atomic gases trapped in 2d optical lattices  @xcite , it seems far from being accurate for spatially continuous systems : at temperatures of the order of the bkt transition temperature , the amplitude of the density fluctuations in the gas is not negligible as compared to the density itself @xcite .",
    "our work aims at going beyond this approximation so to fully include the effect of density fluctuations .",
    "the fact that it is based on c - number fields gives to the present semi - classical method an advantage over standard quantum monte carlo techniques in view of the study of vortices .",
    "the paper is divided in two main parts . in the first part ( sec.[sec : sc ] ) , we introduce the semi - classical method in the grand - canonical ( sec.[sec : gc ] ) and in the canonical ( sec.[subsec : itce ] ) ensembles , and we characterize its range of applicability ( sec.[sec : limits ] ) . in the second part ( sec.[sec : appl ] ) , we discuss the physics of the two - dimensional bose gas .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sec.[sec : numerical ] : different observables are considered , e.g.  the normal and non - condensed fractions , the density fluctuations , the vortex density , and the vortex pair - distribution function . in sec.[subsec : bog ] the effect of bose condensation on the vortex density in the finite size ideal gas is discussed analytically ; this requires the use of the canonical ensemble , which introduces new features with respect to the well - studied grand canonical case @xcite . in sec.[sec : analyt ] a simple model including the interacting case is developed to understand the numerical results , principally the ones for the vortex density @xmath2 : an activation law of the form @xmath3 is found in the low - temperature regime , and the dependence of @xmath4 on the system parameters such as the interaction strength and the system size is discussed : the main qualitative differences between the ideal and the interacting gas behaviors are pointed out .",
