    "geometrically frustrated quantum magnets display a fascinating variety of quantum ground states and associated emergent phenomena .",
    "typically , frustration gives rise to an extensive number of ground states in the classical limit and the addition of quantum fluctuations leads to exotic collective quantum behavior .",
    "perhaps the simplest and hence most tractable models featuring such an interplay of geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations are the fully - frustrated ising systems in a transverse field @xcite . on lattices like the square or the honeycomb lattice , the frustration results from the incompatibility of the odd number of ferro- and anti - ferromagnetic bonds in a single plaquette having an even number of bonds .",
    "all fully - frustrated transverse field ising models ( tfims ) exhibit a classical ground - state manifold with a macroscopic degeneracy which is lifted in the presence of an infinitesimal transverse field inducing quantum fluctuations . in the limit of high transverse fields ,",
    "all tfims realize a quantum disordered polarized phase .",
    "the situation for the opposite limit of weak fields is much more involved .",
    "a large number of frustrated tfims exhibits a nontrivial quantum ordered phase arising from classical disorder , a scenario which is also known as _ order by disorder _ @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the kagome lattice plays a distinguished role in two dimensions as it is very reluctant to order @xcite .",
    "this system is a quantum paramagnet for arbitrary transverse fields providing an instance of _ disorder by disorder _",
    "@xcite in which quantum fluctuations select a quantum disordered state out of the classically disordered ground - state manifold .",
    "the same kind of disorder by disorder scenario has recently been established for the topologically ordered toric code in a field on the dice lattice using a duality transformation @xcite .    to date , the only known tfim featuring such an unusual disorder by disorder scenario in one dimension is the sawtooth chain @xcite , a system of cornersharing triangles .",
    "the central objective of this paper is to give strong evidences for a disorder by disorder scenario for the frustrated tfim on a diamond chain .",
    "the latter system consists of cornersharing squared plaquettes with an even number of bonds and it therefore represents the first instance of disorder by disorder for such a system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly introduce the tfim on a diamond chain . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] we give technical details for the high - order series expansions and the exact diagonalizations .",

    "we study the ising model in a transverse magnetic field on a diamond chain .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 with pauli matrices @xmath2 acting on site @xmath3 , the antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor exchange @xmath4 , and the strength of the transverse magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "here we consider the two cases @xmath6 on every plaquette @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the unfrustrated tfim and @xmath9 is the fully - frustrated tfim on the diamond chain .    to be more specific , we consider the following two choices of ising couplings as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamond_chain ] @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) corresponds to the unfrustrated ( frustrated ) case and @xmath13 denotes the unit cell consisting of three sites @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . in the following we focus on @xmath17 .",
    "are equal , the system is unfrustrated ( upper panel ) .",
    "the system is highly frustrated if the ising coupling on the thick red bonds for each plaquette @xmath7 has a different sign compared to the other three bonds in the same plaquette ( lower panel ) . in both cases",
    "one can use the three - site unit cell with sites 1 , 2 , and 3 illustrated as a black box . ]",
    "starting from the high - field limit @xmath18 , we use perturbative continuous unitary transformations ( pcuts ) @xcite to derive a quasi - particle conserving effective hamiltonian in the zero- and one - particle sector up to high order in perturbation .    for this purpose , it is expedient to interpret the elementary excitations corresponding to single spin flips as quasi - particles above the vacuum which is given by the fully polarized state .",
    "the spin flips are then described in terms of hardcore bosons represented by creation and annihilation operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 . besides the usual bosonic commutation relations these operators meet the hardcore constraint @xmath21 which means that every site @xmath3 can be occupied at most by one boson as every spin is either up or down ( or in bosonic language : occupied or empty ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ising ] ) can then be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the perturbation parameter , , and @xmath24 is the local density on site @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the total number of sites .",
    "we identify the ising term as the perturbation @xmath26 which can be decomposed into a sum of @xmath27 operators incrementing ( or decrementing ) the number of quasi - particles by @xmath28 .",
    "the pcut maps the initial hamiltonian ( [ eq : initial_hamiltonian ] ) to an effective hamiltonian of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the coefficients @xmath31 are rational numbers .",
    "the constraint reflects the quasi - particle conserving property of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the terms @xmath32 can be interpreted as virtual fluctuations involving up to @xmath33 bonds .",
    "due to the linked cluster theorem only linked fluctuations have a finite overall contribution .",
    "hence , the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : eff_hamiltonian ] ) can be used to calculate the one - particle excitation energies in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the unfrustrated and the frustrated diamond chain have a three - site unit cell . the effective one - particle hamiltonian can therefore be written as @xmath34 in this definition we have introduced the annihilation and creation operators in momentum space defined by and @xmath35 specify the site inside the unit cell .",
    "note , that the number of unit cells @xmath36 is equal to @xmath37 .",
    "one therefore has three one - particle bands @xmath38 for both diamond chains which we have calculated as high - order series expansions in the perturbative parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the minimal one - particle energy @xmath40 corresponds to the one - particle gap which is the central quantity we want to analyze in the following sections .",
    "in this section we study the zero - temperature phase diagram of the unfrustrated tfim @xmath41 for @xmath42 , one has two degenerate ground states , either all spins point up or down . in the opposite limit @xmath43 , the ground state is unique corresponding to the fully polarized state where all spins point in @xmath39 direction . in between these two limits",
    ", one expects a second - order phase transition in the 2d ising universality class separating the polarized high - field phase from the @xmath0 symmetry broken phase present at small fields .",
    "we have calculated the one - particle bands @xmath38 as high - order series expansions up to order 12 in @xmath39 .",
    "let us stress that due to the reflection symmetry of the unfrustrated diamond chain with respect to the centerline of the chain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diamond_chain ] ) , the @xmath44 matrix @xmath45 is block - diagonal having an isolated band @xmath46 with odd parity and a @xmath47 subblock with even parity .",
    "the band @xmath46 is found to be exactly flat which can be understood in terms of a local one - particle mode ( see also ref .   for the physics of localized magnons )",
    "@xmath48 with @xmath49 . here",

    "this mode is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_modes]a . the locality results from exact destructive interferences due to the opposite amplitudes @xmath52 in the definition of @xmath53 following exactly the same principles already established in ref .  .",
    "however , contrary to the results on the kagome lattice , there are no fluctuations breaking the destructive interference pattern and the mode is local up to infinite order perturbation theory .",
    "the bands with even parity have a finite dispersion starting in leading order perturbation theory .",
    "the one - particle gap @xmath54 is located at @xmath55 and it has even parity . up to order 12 , the gap is given by @xmath56        apart from the one - particle gap @xmath54 obtained by series expansions , we use exact diagonalizations of finite systems to calculate the gap by taking the difference between the first two energy levels of finite systems up to @xmath57 sites .",

    "[ fig : uftfim_x_extrapolation ] .",
    "we find that many dlogpad approximants are defective displaying an unphysical pole at intermediate values of @xmath39 .",
    "restricting to the remaining approximants yields convincingly a quantum critical point at @xmath58 .",
    "this is also in good agreement with the exact diagonalization data .",
    "furthremore , the critical exponent @xmath59 is found to be @xmath60 from the dlogpad approximants fully consistent with the expected 2d ising universality class having @xmath61 .     as a function of @xmath39 for the unfrustrated tfim .",
    "lines correspond to dlogpad extrapolants while symbols represent exact diagonalization data of different finite - size samples with @xmath25 sites .",

    "in this section we aim at analyzing the fate of the polarized phase for the frustrated diamond chain .",
    "this is again done by comparing high - order series expansions of the one - particle excitations and exact diagonalizations .",
    "we find that all three one - particle bands @xmath62 are exactly flat for the frustrated diamond chain .",
    "the latter is found for the series expansion in the thermodynamic limit as well as for the lowest excitation energies calculated by exact diagonalization on finite clusters .",
    "this exact momentum independence can be understood ( again ) by means of the high - field limit in terms of local modes which are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_modes](b - c ) . for this purpose",
    "we define @xmath63 the resulting modes are local up to infinite order perturbation theory and the guiding priniciples are similar to those in ref .  . yet",
    ", the sign of the couplings @xmath64 play an essential role in the resulting locality of these modes and must be taken into account .",
    "this is exemplified in first - order perturbation theory for the local mode @xmath65 : @xmath66 .",
    "the destructive interference leftwards is caused by the different signs of the wave functions whereas the destructive interference rightwards is caused by the different signs of the couplings .",
    "this precept can be extended to infinite order perturbation theory , i.e.  the mode @xmath65 is an exact local mode such that @xmath67 .",
    "this is different for @xmath68 .",
    "the two other local modes @xmath69 are linear combinations of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "interestingly , we find that .",
    "in contrast , the off - diagonal components have only entries of even order . as a consequence , the relation @xmath72 holds .",
    "up to order 14 , the energies of the three flat bands @xmath73 are given by @xmath74    in the following we analyze the one - particle gap on the whole parameter axis in order to clarify whether the frustrated tfim on a diamond chain realizes a disorder by disorder scenario . at this point",
    "we assume that binding effects are small for the tfim and , consequently , multi - particle sectors play no role for the excitation gap ( for any @xmath75 ) .",
    "this assumption is reasonable since the leading contribution to the two - particle interaction is repulsive and of order @xmath76 perturbation theory .",
    "additionally , this is confirmed below by exact diagonalizations .    for the extrapolation it is convenient to perform an euler transformation @xmath77 which maps the parameter axis @xmath78 on the finite interval @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "one expects that the dlogpad extrapolants in @xmath80 are more stable within the finite interval @xmath81}$ ] allowing to estimate the gap for @xmath82 which corresponds to @xmath83 .",
    "the resulting extrapolations of the high - field gap are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fftfim_u_extrapolation ] .    for @xmath84 , all extrapolations are well converged .",
    "a closing of the gap in this region can therefore be excluded .",
    "note that the bare series of @xmath85 converges very slowly as the absolute value of the coefficients grows exponentially with ascending order and , additionally , as the sign of the coefficients alternate .",
    "this behavior is very similar to the analogue series for the kagome tfim @xcite . but",
    "also far beyond the high - field regime most extrapolants indicate the clear trend that there is no tendency to close the gap for any value of @xmath80 . additionally , most of the extrapolations approach a finite value @xmath86 for @xmath83 .     as a function of @xmath80 .",
    "lines correspond to dlogpad extrapolants in @xmath87 while symbols represent exact diagonalization data for different finite - size samples .",
    "_ inset _ : limiting value @xmath88 from ed as a function of @xmath89 . ]    these findings are fully confirmed by our ed results which are also displayed in fig .  [ fig : fftfim_u_extrapolation ] .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the elementary particle gap is already fully converged in ed on the full parameter axis for finite systems up to @xmath57 sites .",
    "indeed , even for @xmath83 one finds a value @xmath90 with almost no finite - size effects ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : fftfim_u_extrapolation ] ) .",
    "one can therefore conclude without any doubt that the frustrated tfim on the diamond chain realizes a disorder by disorder scenario at zero temperature . in comparison to the other two cases , namely the sawtooth chain and the kagome lattice ,",
    "the numerical accuracy is very high for the diamond chain .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the fact that the all one - particle excitations correspond to exact local modes for the diamond chain which is not the case for the other two systems .",
    "the perfect convergence of the frustrated tfim on the diamond chain , signaling a disorder by disorder scenario , motivates an investigation of the low - field limit @xmath91 in order to gain a deeper physical understanding . as shown above",
    ", an infinitesimal field lifts the extensive ground - state degeneracy of the pure ising model such that the ground state is unique and the elementary excitation is still @xmath36-fold degenerate which is associated with the local mode @xmath92 .",
    "the gap in the low - field limit @xmath93 is connected to the gap of the high - field limit by @xmath94 in the following , we use first - order degenerate perturbation theory about the low - field limit to pinpoint the quantum disordered nature of the ground state and to calculate the gap @xmath95 accurately .    for the unperturbed problem @xmath42 , one has the extensive number @xmath96 of ground states .",
    "in fact , any state is a ground state if it has exactly one frustrated bond per plaquette . here",
    "a frustrated bond corresponds to a ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) alignment of spins for an antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) ising coupling on a bond .",
    "it is then useful to introduce an intuitive picture and to describe the physics in terms of frustrated bonds , i.e.  a frustrated bond is viewed as a quasi - particle which is a hardcore boson living on the dual lattice of bonds as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dual_lattice](a ) .",
    "all states containing exactly one particle ( one frustrated bond ) per plaquette are ground states of the unperturbed ising model .",
    "note that ground states related by a global spin flip are mapped onto the same state in the language of frustrated bonds .     which take place inside a unit cell .",
    "black squares ( white squares ) correspond to the presence ( absence ) of a frustrated bond .",

    "( d ) processes of the hamiltonian @xmath100 acting on nearest - neighbor unit cells such that the number of frustrated bonds equals one in each unit cell . ]    in what follows we are deriving an effective hamiltonian using degenerate perturbation theory in @xmath101 without considering the unimportant constant energy of the unperturbed ising model . in first order",
    ", the effective hamiltonian contains all processes where different ground states are coupled by the transverse magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the action of the field on a site of the original model is such that the occupation of particles is inverted on all bonds containing this site . keeping in mind that the total number of particles in each plaquette must be one , the effective hamiltonian in terms of frustrated bonds ( fb )",
    "is given by @xmath102 with @xmath103 here , @xmath104 @xmath105 creates ( annihilates ) a frustrated bond on the plaquette @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dual_lattice](a ) ) .",
    "one has two different contributions @xmath107 and @xmath108 which reflects the fact that one has two different types of sites in the diamond chain .",
    "the upper and lower sites @xmath14 and @xmath16 are part of two bonds ( @xmath107 ) while the middle sites @xmath15 belong to four bonds ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the different processes are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dual_lattice](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : dual_lattice](d ) .",
    "interestingly , the parity @xmath109 in _ each _ plaquette with respect to reflections about the centerline of the diamond chain is conserved for the full hamiltonian @xmath110 . as a consequence ,",
    "the hilbert space decouples into @xmath111 blocks with fixed parities .",
    "it is therefore convenient to switch to the diagonal basis of the quadratic part @xmath107 in order to exploit these conservation laws . a single plaquette @xmath106 has four one - particle states yielding the eigenstates @xmath112 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dual_lattice](c ) .",
    "hence , the ground state of @xmath107 alone is @xmath111 degenerate which means that the extensive ground - state degeneracy @xmath96 of the ising model is only partly lifted .",
    "next , we consider the term @xmath100 in the diagonal basis of @xmath107 . due to the parity conservation in each plaquette ,",
    "matrix elements of @xmath100 acting on nearest - neighbor plaquettes split into four decoupled sectors @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 . for these four sectors",
    "one finds the following relations @xmath117 where @xmath118 and all other matrix elements vanish because of parity conservation .",
    "thus , the total spectrum of @xmath110 is invariant under the exchange of @xmath119 and @xmath120 in each plaquette .    in each parity sector , one is left with a pseudo - spin @xmath121 @xmath122 on each plaquette .",
    "one can therefore associate the state @xmath123 with spin up and the state @xmath124 with spin down .",
    "finally , for each parity sector one obtains the following hamiltonian @xmath125 with @xmath126 if both plaquettes @xmath106 and @xmath127 have the same parity ( @xmath113 or @xmath114 ) and @xmath128 if parities are different ( @xmath116 or @xmath115 ) .",
    "thus , nearest - neighbor plaquettes having the same parity are energetically favored due to the term @xmath129 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the ground state of @xmath110 is in the sector where all parities are either @xmath119 or @xmath120 resulting in a two - fold degeneracy .",
    "most importantly , the hamiltonian @xmath130 reduces to the conventional transverse field ising chain in these two parity sectors @xmath131 because all operators in @xmath130 which are asymmetric with respect to interchanging @xmath106 and @xmath127 cancel exactly .",
    "the transverse field ising chain can be solved exactly by fermionization @xcite . for the above prefactors ,",
    "one finds a disordered ( polarized ) ground state with an excitation gap @xmath132 fully consistent with our expectation of a disorder by disorder scenario for the diamond chain .",
    "next , we aim at calculating @xmath93 from @xmath130 which must be located in a different parity sector .",
    "physically , it is reasonable that this sector is the one with finite but minimal number of nearest - neighbor plaquettes having opposite parities .",
    "this suggests to consider the parity sector `` @xmath133 '' with one `` domain wall '' .",
    "the expected low - energy gap @xmath134 in units of @xmath135 calculated in sec .",
    "[ sec : fftfim ] for the limit @xmath136 should then correspond to the difference of the ground - state energies of this sector with the one without domain walls .    in order to check this reasoning ,",
    "we have introduced a parameter @xmath137 such that @xmath138 and we have set up a high - order series expansion in @xmath137 for this gap .",
    "up to order 16 , one finds the following expression    @xmath139    the amplitudes of this series decrease strongly with increasing order which originates from the facts that ( i ) the gap corresponds to a difference of ground - state energies of two protected parity sectors and ( ii ) the energy gaps to excited states inside each parity sector are large . as a consequence , we find that the gap @xmath140 at @xmath141 , which corresponds to original problem @xmath110 , is converged in the first four digits .",
    "this is in full agreement with the numerical findings of the frustrated tfim on the diamond chain presented in the previous section . in particular ,",
    "the domain wall excitation is localized as expected from the existence of the local mode @xmath92 discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fftfim ] .",
    "moreover , this perfect agreement essentially proves that the true ground state corresponds exactly to the one of the transvserse field ising chain in the effective low - energy description . as a consequence",
    ", we have demonstrated exactly that the frustrated tfim on the diamond chain realizes a disorder by disorder scenario .",
    "we have studied the unfrustrated and frustrated tfim on a diamond chain at zero temperature .",
    "the unfrustrated model is found to be in the expected 2d ising universality class separating a @xmath0 broken state and a quantum disordered polarized phase .",
    "in contrast , convincing evidences have been found that the frustrated diamond chain realizes a disorder by disorder scenario , i.e.  the ground state at infinitesimal fields is adiabatically connected to the high - field polarized phase .",
    "most strikingly , an effective low - energy description in terms of frustrated bonds allows to clarify exactly that the ground state of the frustrated tfim on the diamond chain is quantum disordered for an infinitesimal field .",
    "the elementary excitation in this effective language corresponds to a localized domain wall which is gapped .",
    "the fully - frustrated tfim on the diamond chain is therefore the third system displaying disorder by disorder .",
    "the other two cases are on lattices of cornersharing triangles , namely the one - dimensional sawtooth chain @xcite and the two - dimensional kagome lattice @xcite . in contrast",
    ", the frustrated diamond chain is made of cornersharing squared plaquettes and it is remarkable that all one - particle bands are exactly flat . in our opinion",
    "it is therefore important to study further families of frustrated tfims on lattices made of cornersharing plaquettes which we left for future studies .",
