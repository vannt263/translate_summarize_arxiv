    "transiting extrasolar planets provide much valuable information , not only planetary mass and radius , but also planetary atmospheric composition . because the optical thickness of a planetary atmosphere varies with wavelength depending on the atmospheric composition",
    ", one can probe atmospheric constituents by measuring transit radii with different wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far , this technique , known as the transmission spectroscopy , has been applied for several transiting hot jupiters orbiting nearby bright host stars , as represented by hd  209458b and hd  189733b . in the atmosphere of hd  209458b ,",
    "past observations detected many absorption and scattering features such as na , h @xcite , o , c @xcite , tio , vo , h@xmath19 , h@xmath19o @xcite , and co @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "hd  189733b has been revealed to have a featureless transmission spectrum over optical to possibly near infrared regions , while absorption features of na and h were detected .",
    "this featureless spectrum has been interpreted as rayleigh scattering due to high - altitude haze which dominates over molecular features .",
    "recently , it has become possible to expand this technique to low - mass planets , often referred to as exo - neptunes ( 10 @xmath20 @xmath21m@xmath22 @xmath20 30 ) and super - earths ( @xmath21m@xmath22 @xmath20 10 ) , thanks to the discoveries of transiting low - mass planets around nearby low - mass stars ( m dwarfs ) . because m dwarfs have smaller radii compared to sun - like stars , they show deeper transits for a same - sized transiting planet , enabling us to obtain high signal - to - noise - ratio transit signals , which are needed for transmission spectroscopy , even for small planets .",
    "the first two such examples are gj436b and gj1214b @xcite , both of which are orbiting nearby m dwarfs . they can be thought to be the representatives of exo - neptunes and super - earths , respectively , in the sense of their masses ( @xmath2323 and @xmath236.6 @xmath5 , respectively ) . as for gj436b , no firm molecular feature has been detected by transmission spectroscopy probably because of difficulties due to instrumental systematics @xcite and stellar activity @xcite , while a methane - poor and co - rich atmospheric model has been supported @xcite by combining the interpretation of the dayside spectrum obtained via secondary eclipse observations @xcite . the super - earth gj1214b has received much more attention since its discovery .",
    "intensive observations by many observational groups have revealed that gj1214b has a flat spectrum over optical to infrared wavelengths .",
    "this flat spectrum has been interpreted as the consequence of either a water - dominated atmosphere or a hydrogen - dominated but hazy / cloudy atmosphere , although which model is correct is still an open question ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "gj3470b , the target of this paper , is the third low - mass ( @xmath24 ) transiting planet discovered among nearby ( @xmath25 pc ) m dwarfs that provides a great opportunity of extending the atmospheric study for low - mass planets . because its mass , @xmath26 , is intermediate between those of gj436b and gj1214b , this planet should be a good sample for comparative study of atmospheric properties of low - mass planets .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter d13 ) have recently reported follow - up observations for this system including @xmath10/irac 4.5-@xmath11 m photometry of two primary transits of gj3470b .",
    "they precisely determined the planetary mass and radius as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , revealing its very low density ( @xmath29 g @xmath9 ) .",
    "this implies that gj3470b has a light - gas atmosphere with enlarged spectrum features , thus making this planet as an attractive target for transmission spectroscopic studies .",
    "nonetheless , no such study for this planet has been reported yet .",
    "here we present optical - to - near - infrared simultaneous photometric observations for a primary transit of gj3470b obtained by using the 188-cm telescope and the 50-cm mitsume telescope both at okayama astrophysical observatory .",
    "the simultaneous observations have a great advantage for transmission - spectroscopic study .",
    "if the host star has cool star - spots on its surface , transit depth ( square of planet - star radius ratio ) can vary with time due to the variations of apparent luminous area of the star according to the stellar rotation and appearing / vanishing of the star - spots ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this changes the apparent planetary radius with time .",
    "therefore , the simultaneous observations enable us to investigate the wavelength dependence of planetary radius without concern for this star - spot effect .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our observations in section [ sec : obs ] , followed by data reduction and analysis in section [ sec : data_reduction ] and section [ sec : mcmc ] , respectively .",
    "we discuss implications from our results in section [ sec : discussion ] , and summarize this study in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we conducted @xmath3-band photometric observations for gj3470 on the expected transit night of 2012",
    "november 15 , by using the near - infrared imaging and spectroscopic instrument isle @xcite , which is mounted on the cassegrain focus of the 188 cm telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory in japan .",
    "isle has a 1,024 @xmath30 1,024 hgcdte hawaii-1 array with the pixel scale of 0@xmath31.245 pixel@xmath32 , providing the field of view of 4@xmath33.3 on a side . for relative photometry",
    ", we introduced a comparison star ( 2mass:07591316 + 1525479 , j=8.73 ) onto the detecter simultaneously with the target star gj3470 , where the two stars are separated by 2@xmath33.9 . at the beginning of the observations ,",
    "the stellar positions on the detector were carefully set so that the both stellar images did not cover any bad pixels . during the observations ,",
    "the telescope was defocused so that the full width at half maximum of the stellar point spread function ( psf ) was @xmath2320 pixel , or @xmath235@xmath31 , in order to mitigate the incompleteness of pixel - to - pixel - sensitivity ( flat - fielding ) correction and to extend the exposure time as long as possible while avoiding saturation .",
    "the exposure time was set to 30 sec , with which the peak analog - to - digital - unit ( adu ) count of the brighter star ( the comparison star ) is well below the threshold of 25,000 adu , above which the ad converting relation deviates more than 1% from a linear relation . the dead time including readout time for each exposure was 6 s. an observing log is shown in table [ tbl : obslog ] .",
    "the 188-cm telescope is equipped with an offset guider system on the cassegrain focus , which can correct the telescope tracking error every one second at minimum by using a fast - readout ccd camera which can keep track of a bright star coming into the surrounding area of the main detector .",
    "however , it had been recognized from past observations with isle that the stellar centroid positions on the isle detector slightly ( a few pixels ) changed over several hours even when the guiding system was activated .",
    "this slight stellar displacement had introduced systematic errors into photometry . in order to correct this effect ,",
    "we have developed an offset - correcting system which corrects the reference point of the guide star on the guiding camera , by calculating the displacement of stellar centroids on the last isle images relative to a reference image .",
    "each correction needs an additional dead time for isle of 8 s. for the transit observations of gj3470b , we activated this system with the frequency of the offset correction as once in 10 isle exposures .",
    "as a result , the stellar centroid change during the observations was well suppressed with 1.1 and 0.6 pixels in root mean square ( rms ) for the x ( right ascension ) and y ( decrination ) directions , respectively .",
    "the centroid variation with time on the night is shown in figure [ fig : rawlc_isle ] .      at the same time with the isle j - band observations , we also conducted photometric observations for the same transit of gj3470b in optical wavelengths by using the 50-cm mitsume telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory .",
    "the telescope is equipped with three 1024 @xmath30 1024 pixels ccd cameras , enabling to obtain @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 band images simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the each camera has the pixel scale of 1@xmath31.5 pixel@xmath32 for the field of view of 26@xmath34 26@xmath33 .",
    "the telescope was defocused so that the fwhm of stellar psf is about 10 pixels , or @xmath2315@xmath31 , for the same purpose as the isle observations .",
    "we note that the contamination light from objects surrounding the target star is negligible because there is no object brighter than 20 and 16 magnitudes in any band within 10@xmath31 and 20@xmath31 , respectively , from gj3470 in the sdss photometric catalog @xcite .",
    "the exposure time was set to 60 s. the dead time including readout time for each exposure was 3 s for all bands .",
    "the observing log is compiled in table [ tbl : obslog ] .",
    "because this telescope has no mechanical auto - guiding system and previously caused large tracking error ( @xmath23100 pixels ) over several hours , we have developed a self - guiding software which calculates the displacement of stellar centroid positions on the last - observed @xmath2-band image relative to a reference image , then feeds back it to the telescope to correct the tracking error soon after the last image is obtained . by using this self - guiding software , the stellar centroid displacement during the observations for gj3470",
    "were kept with 1.4 and 0.5 pixels in rms for x ( right ascension ) and y ( declination ) directions , respectively , for all the three bands .",
    "the obtained isle images are reduced by the standard procedure , including dark - image subtraction and flat - fielding correction . for the flat - fielding correction ,",
    "100 dome - flat images obtained on the observing night are used to create a flat - fielding image .",
    "then , aperture photometry is done for the target and comparison star on the reduced images by using a customized tool @xcite , applying a constant aperture radius for all images .",
    "a light curve is created by dividing gj3470 s fluxes by comparison s ones .",
    "we eliminate apparent outliers due to such as passing clouds and cosmic - ray hitting from the light curve .",
    "the time for each data point is assigned as the mid time of each exposure in the time system of barycentric julian day ( bjd ) based on barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) , which is converted from the time stamp recorded on the fits header in the time system of julian day ( jd ) based on coordinated universal time ( utc ) by using the code of @xcite .    in order to select an appropriate aperture radius ,",
    "we create a number of trial light curves with changing the aperture radius by 1 pixel , and evaluate the dispersion of the out - of - transit ( oot ) part of these trial light curves .",
    "we find that the light curve produced with the aperture radius of 34 pixels gives the minimum dispersion , and therefore use this light curve for further analyses .",
    "the selected light curve is shown in figure [ fig : rawlc_isle ] .",
    "subsequently , in order to correct the systematic trend in the light curve , which is apparent in the oot light curve , we take the following procedure .",
    "first , we fit the oot light curve with several baseline models given by the following formulae : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the baseline flux , @xmath37 are variables , and @xmath38 are coefficients .",
    "generally , systematic trends could arise due to airmass change , slow variability of gj3470 and/or the comparison star themselves , and stellar displacement on the detector .",
    "therefore , for the variables @xmath37 , we test several combinations of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , where @xmath39 is airmass , @xmath40 is time , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the relative centroid positions in @xmath44 and @xmath45 directions , respectively .",
    "next , we evaluate the bayesian information criteria ( bic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the respective baseline models .",
    "the bic value for the oot light curve is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the @xmath48 value of the baseline fit for the oot part , @xmath49 is the number of free parameters , and @xmath50 is the number of oot data points .",
    "we find that the @xmath51 model gives the minimum bic@xmath52 value among all the baseline models , and therefore apply this model to correct the systematic trend in the entire light curve . in table",
    "[ tbl : amoeba ] , we list the bic@xmath52 values and the rms of the oot light curve ( rms@xmath52 ) for the four representative baseline models of @xmath53 = @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . noticeably , including @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath37",
    "provides a significant improvement on both the bic@xmath52 and rms@xmath52 values , from bic@xmath58 and rms@xmath52 @xmath59 for the @xmath54 model to bic@xmath60 and rms@xmath52 @xmath61 for the @xmath55 model .",
    "this fact indicates that the stellar displacements on the detector produces significant systematics on the photometry , and the displacements during our observations were enough suppressed such that the systematics can be corrected , owing to the development of the offset - correction system ( section [ sec : isle_obs ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : rawlc_isle ] , we also plot the the best - fit oot light curve with the baseline model of @xmath51 , along with the time variations of @xmath39 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the corrected light curve is shown in figure [ fig : fittedlc_isle ] .",
    "the selected baseline model of @xmath51 is , however , not so significantly favored compared to other baseline models of @xmath62 and @xmath57 , given the bic@xmath52 difference of only @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the choice of baseline model could be a cause of a systematic error on the final result , i.e. , transit parameters . in order to evaluate the impact of this systematic effect",
    ", we fit the entire light curves corrected by different baseline models with a transit model , and compare the resultant parameters .",
    "the transit parameters we use are the planet - star radius ratio , @xmath13 , the mid transit time , @xmath64 , the semi - major axis normalized by the stellar radius , @xmath65 , the impact parameter , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the orbital inclination , and the coefficients for stellar limb - darkening effect .",
    "we adopt the orbital eccentricity and orbital period as @xmath68 and @xmath69 days , respectively , from d13 . for a stellar limb - darkening model",
    ", we use the quadratic limb - darkening raw , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the intensity , @xmath11 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the line from the stellar center to the position of the stellar surface , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the coefficients . because @xmath72 and @xmath73 are heavily correlated and can not independently be constrained well , we let @xmath72 free while fix @xmath73 at a theoretical value during the fitting process ; we adopt @xmath74 , witch is the mean of the two values for \\{@xmath75 , @xmath76 } = \\{3600 , 4.5 } and \\{3600 , 5.0 } , where @xmath75 ( k ) is the stellar effective temperature and @xmath76 ( cgs ) is the stellar surface gravity , in the table given by ( the @xmath75 and @xmath76 values for gj3470 were derived by d13 as @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively ) . for calculating a transit model , we use the analytic formula given by @xcite , which is equivalent with that of @xcite when using the quadratic limb - darkening raw .",
    "the best - fit parameters are determined by the amoeba algorithm @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : fittedlc_isle ] , the best - fit transit model for the light curve corrected with the @xmath37 = @xmath55 model is plotted .",
    "the photometric errors are rescaled so that the reduced @xmath48 value for the best - fit transit model becomes unity .",
    "the derived best - fit values and uncertainties of @xmath13 , @xmath65 , and @xmath64 , as well as the @xmath48 values are listed in table [ tbl : amoeba ] . while the @xmath48 value for the @xmath37 = @xmath54 model is relatively large as expected ,",
    "those for the other three models of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are very close to each other . however , the @xmath13 values for these three models are slightly different , with the largest difference of 0.00081 between @xmath55 and @xmath57 , which is comparable to the 1-@xmath79 uncertainties of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we consider this discrepancy as a systematic error in @xmath13 , and will be taken into account in the study of wavelength dependency of @xmath13 discussed in section [ sec : radius_ratio ] . on the other hand , the baseline - model dependences on @xmath65 , @xmath80 , and @xmath64",
    "are negligible compared to their 1-@xmath79 uncertainties .",
    "the obtained mitsume images are reduced in the same way as the isle images . for the flat - fielding correction",
    ", 27 twilight - flat images for each band obtained on the observing night are used to create each flat - fielding image .",
    "we then apply aperture photometry for gj3470 and dozens of bright stars on the reduced images , with a number of trial aperture radii incremented by 0.5 pixels . among a number of combinations of aperture radii and comparison stars",
    ", we first visually select several good combinations which produce less - dispersed light curves with respect to a transit signature .",
    "next , we fit each trial light curve including the transit part with a transit + a tentative - baseline model , and select the least - dispersed light curve as the most appropriate one for each band .",
    "the reason of including the transit part is that , unlike the @xmath3-band data , the mitsume data do not have enough number of oot data . for the tentative baseline model",
    ", we use equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with @xmath37 = @xmath54 . as for the transit model",
    ", we use the same parameterization as section [ sec : reduction_isle ] . for the @xmath2- and @xmath1-band data , we fix @xmath73 at the theoretical values of 0.338 and 0.322 , respectively , while let @xmath72 free during the fitting process . for the @xmath0-band data , we fix both @xmath72 and @xmath73 at the theoretical values of 0.486 and 0.289 , respectively , because it is too poor to constrain @xmath72 nor @xmath73 by the current data .",
    "these theoretical values are derived by the same way as for the @xmath3-band data .",
    "in addition , we force @xmath65 and @xmath80 to the values derived from d13 , namely 13.4 and 0.40 , respectively .",
    "this is because the @xmath10 s data used by d13 is more precise than the mitsume s data , and we are more focusing on studying the wavelength dependence of @xmath13 ( see section [ sec : radius_ratio ] ) rather than constraining other parameters . as a result , we select the light curves produced with the aperture radii of 7.0 , 8.0 , and 6.0 pixels , and the number of comparison stars of 4 , 10 , and 8 , for @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 bands , respectively .",
    "we note that these results are robust over different baseline models .",
    "subsequently , in order to select appropriate baseline models for correcting systematic trends , we again fit the selected light curves with a transit + several baseline models . at this time",
    ", we test the three baseline models of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . we do not include @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath37 because we do not find any improvement for any bands when we preliminary fit the light curves by including @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in table",
    "[ tbl : amoeba_oao50 ] , we list the resultant bic and rms values for the three baseline models for each band . for the @xmath2 and @xmath0 bands ,",
    "we find that the baseline model of @xmath81 gives the minimum bic values , and therefore adopt it for correcting the systematic trends in these light curves . on the other hand , for the @xmath1-band data ,",
    "all the three baseline models give almost the same bic values , indicating that the three models have the same statistical significance .",
    "so , we decide to select the model @xmath84 among the three models , based on the fact that the rms values for @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath85 ) are slightly better than that for @xmath54 ( @xmath86 ) , and it is physically more straightforward to include airmass in the variables rather than just a polynomial function of time .    as also discussed in section",
    "[ sec : reduction_isle ] , the selection of baseline models could affect on the final result . in table [ tbl : amoeba_oao50 ] , we also list the resultant @xmath13 values for the respective models for each band .",
    "the largest differences of @xmath13 are 0.0014 , 0.0060 , and 0.009 , for the @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 bands , respectively .",
    "the differences for the @xmath2 and @xmath0 bands are comparable to and less than the 1-@xmath79 uncertainties of @xmath13 , respectively , while that for the @xmath1 band is more than 3 times the 1-@xmath79 uncertainty of @xmath13 .",

    "in order to derive the final transit parameters and their uncertainties , we analyze the corrected @xmath3- , @xmath2- , @xmath1- , and @xmath0-band light curves simultaneously by the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method by using a customized code @xcite . in this analysis , we treat @xmath80 , @xmath65 , and @xmath64 as common parameters for all the four light curves , while @xmath13 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 as independent parameters for the respective light curves so as to take the wavelength dependences of these parameters into account .",

    "next , we investigate the stellar mass and radius . the stellar density , @xmath110 , can directly be derived from @xmath65 and @xmath111 via the following relation assuming a circular orbit : @xmath112 @xmath113 . from our mcmc results ,",

    "in addition , metallicity dependence of this relation was not found in the samples , however , @xcite have recently found , based on interferometric radius measurements for 33 single k - m dwarfs , that a color - radius relation for low - mass stars clearly depends on metallicity .",
    "therefore , the relation adopted by d13 could potentially have a systematic offset . in figure",
    "[ fig : msrs ] , we plot a mass - radius relation for low - mass stars provided by @xcite ( green shaded region ) , which was derived based on the radius measurements for the 33 k - m dwarfs and an empirical mass - luminosity relation of @xcite , which is consistent with that of .",
    "we also plot a mass - radius relation for gj3470 drawn by connecting the two empirical relations that d13 adopted ( light - blue shaded region ) , where @xmath122 is used for the mass - luminosity calibration and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are used for the diameter - color - luminosity calibration .",
    "these two relations do not cross each other , implying that some systematic offset could exist , possibly in the diameter - color - luminosity relation of due to the small number of low - mass star samples and the unconsidered metallicity dependence .",
    "therefore , instead of using the same way as d13 , we solve @xmath125 and @xmath126 from @xmath110 by using the mass - radius relation of @xcite ( equation ( 4 ) in the paper ) .",
    "we note that any metallicity dependence of this relation was detected @xcite . in order to properly estimate @xmath125 , @xmath126 and their uncertainties ,",
    "we create probability distributions of these parameters by using a monte carlo ( mc ) technique .",
    "that is , the probability distributions are created by repeating the process that the values of @xmath65 and three coefficients of the mass - radius relation are taken according to their respective probability distributions , and then @xmath125 and @xmath126 are solved .",
    "for the probability distribution of @xmath65 , the posterior distribution created from the mcmc analysis is used , while for those of the three coefficients , gaussian distributions whose standard deviations are set to their 1-@xmath79 errors are used .",
    "the resultant median values and the 68.3% confidence intervals are calculated as @xmath127 @xmath118 and @xmath128 @xmath120 . in figure",
    "[ fig : msrs ] , we also plot the derived @xmath125 and @xmath126 values ( red circle ) as well as those reported by d13 ( brown triangle ) .",
    "our @xmath125 and @xmath126 values are both consistent with those by d13 within 1 @xmath79 .",
    "however , this agreement is by coincidence , because the derived stellar density is slightly inconsistent between this work and d13 by more than 1 @xmath79 , and the adopted calibration methods for deriving stellar mass and radius are different and also inconsistent between the two .",
    "thus , further follow - up observations to confirm the stellar mass and radius would be valuable ; photometric transit observations could test the stellar density , and astrometric observations for measuring the trigonometric parallax would provide a new insight into the stellar mass / radius calibration .",
    "finally , using the estimated @xmath125 and @xmath126 , we derive the relevant stellar and planetary parameters . for the planetary radius ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath13 value for @xmath3 band .",
    "this is because not only the @xmath3-band light curve has the highest photometric precision among the four light curves , but also , as will be discussed in section [ sec : radius_ratio ] , the planetary radii for the optical bands could be enlarged due to putative atmospheric haze , and the smaller @xmath3-band planetary radius could represent a haze - free planetary radius . for the planetary mass , we use the following relation assuming a circular orbit : @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is a parameter derived from radial - velocity data and @xmath131 m  s@xmath32  d@xmath132",
    "is adopted from d13 .",
    "the @xmath133 and @xmath134 values as well as other stellar and planetary parameters ( the stellar surface gravity , @xmath76 , the semi - major axis , @xmath135 , the planetary density , @xmath136 , and the planetary surface gravity , @xmath137 ) are derived by the same mc fashion as previously .",
    "the derived values and uncertainties are listed in table [ tbl : mc ] .",
    "the planetary mass , radius , and density are derived as @xmath138 @xmath5 , @xmath139 @xmath7 , and @xmath140 g  cm@xmath32 , respectively .",
    "although the planetary density is @xmath2330% larger than that by d13 ( @xmath12 g cm@xmath32 ) , it is still well lower than that of uranus ( 1.27 g  cm@xmath32 ) despite of its similar mass ( 14.54 @xmath5 ) , confirming the low density of gj3470b , firstly suggested by and recently uncovered by d13 .",
    "we note that the @xmath2330% difference of the planetary density comes mainly from the @xmath2310% smaller planetary radius ( the @xmath237% smaller stellar radius and the @xmath233% smaller planet - star radius ratio ) compared to d13 . in table",
    "[ tbl : mc ] , we also list the results derived from the mcmc analysis with @xmath80 prior , for reference .    in order to investigate the impact of the 10% difference of the planetary radius on the planetary bulk composition",
    ", we have modeled the internal structure of gj3470b that is consistent with the planetary mass and radius derived in this study .",
    "to do so , we have assumed that the planet is composed of three layers , namely , a cloud / haze - free hydrogen - rich atmosphere with solar composition , on top of an ice / water mantle , on top of a rocky core ( the water / rock mass ratio is set to 3 ) .",
    "two - layered structure ( hydrogen - rich atmosphere + rocky core ) is also examined .",
    "the equations of state adopted are scvh eos for hydrogen / helium @xcite , r - eos @xcite and sesame eos @xcite for water , and @xcite for rock ( details are described in kurosaki et al . in prep ) .",
    "we have found that the mass fraction of the hydrogen - rich atmosphere ranges 5% to 9% in the three - layer models and 12% to 19% in the two - layer models .",
    "these values are similar with those derived in d13 .",
    "therefore , the 10% difference in radius does not alter their conclusion that the planet possesses a hydrogen - rich envelope the mass of which accounts for approximately 10% of the planetary total mass .",
    "we note that this conclusion may be consistent with recent theoretical prediction : if the atmosphere embedded in a protoplanetary disk grows in mass beyond 10% of the planetary total mass , its accretion tends to proceed in a runaway fashion @xcite .",
    "thus , nebular - origin atmospheres of @xmath14210% of planetary mass are rarely detected .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the wavelength dependence of @xmath13 based on the results of the mcmc analysis with @xmath80 prior . in figure",
    "[ fig : rprs ] , we plot the @xmath13 values in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 bands , and that in the @xmath10 s 4.5-@xmath11 m band reported by d13 , along with the transmission curves for the respective passbands .",
    "the @xmath13 values in the @xmath2 and 4.5-@xmath11 m bands are larger than that in the @xmath3 band by @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "those in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands are also larger than that in the @xmath3 band , although the uncertainties in these bands are relatively large .    as discussed in section [ sec : reduction_isle ] and [ sec : reduction_mitsume ] , the choice of the baseline model could cause a systematic offset in @xmath13 .",
    "however , the alternative choices of the baseline models for the @xmath1- , @xmath2- , and @xmath3-band light curves work as expanding the discrepancies , as indicated by gray circles in figure [ fig : rprs ] , meaning that the systematics due to the baseline selections can not explain the observed discrepancies of @xmath13 .",
    "unocculted star - spots can also vary apparent @xmath13 with time , due to the variations of apparent luminous area of the star according to the stellar rotation and appearing / vanishing of the star - spots ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the observational epochs are different with @xmath235 months apart , there is a possibility that the observed @xmath13 difference between the @xmath3 and 4.5-@xmath11 m bands is caused by the star - spot effect .",
    "when a spotted host star induces the peak - to - valley variability of @xmath145 , @xmath146 , due to the unocculted star - spot effect , the host star itself will show a peak - to - valley flux variability of @xmath147 with a period consistent with the stellar rotation period .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath18 % difference of @xmath13 between the @xmath3 and 4.5-@xmath11 m bands were caused by star - spots , the host star would have to show at least @xmath148% peak - to - valley intrinsic variability . in order to estimate the maximum intrinsic variability of the host star , we have conducted a long - term photometric monitoring for gj3470 by using the 50-cm mitsume telescope , spanning @xmath2360 days .",
    "the resultant @xmath2-band light curve is shown in figure [ fig : longlc ] , along with the sky - flux variations .",
    "we have found that the rms of the nightly - averaged fluxes is 0.33% and the peak - to - valley variability is merely @xmath231% , indicating that gj3470 is not a very active star and star - spot variations can not account for the observed @xmath13 difference between the @xmath3 and 4.5-@xmath11 m bands , unless the stellar variability is unusually large only in infrared wavelength .",
    "in addition , the difference of @xmath13 between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands can not intrinsically be explained by the spot - rotation effect , because these data were obtained simultaneously .",
    "we note that a possible @xmath2325-day periodic variation seen in the long - monitoring light curve could potentially be due to a star - spot rotation according to the stellar rotation , however , we have found that a part of the flux variations ( jd @xmath149 2,456,258 ) could be correlated with the sky - flux variations , and therefore further monitoring is needed to confirm it ( more will be investigated in a future paper ) .",
    "more likely scenario would be that the planetary atmospheric opacity varies with wavelength due to absorptions and/or scattering by atmospheric molecules .",
    "the relative change in transit depth due to molecular absorptions as a function of wavelength can be approximated by @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the scale factor depending on the molecular opacity , which can be @xmath2310 for strong absorbers @xcite , and @xmath152 is the atmospheric scale height given by @xmath153 , where @xmath49 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath154 is the atmospheric temperature , and @xmath11 is the mean molecular weight . for gj3470b , h@xmath23250400 km when assuming @xmath155650k and a solar - composition atmosphere ( @xmath156 atomic mass ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath157 can be up to @xmath230.16% , which corresponds to the relative change in @xmath13 of @xmath23@xmath158 , indicating that the observed differences of @xmath13 can reasonably be explained by molecular absorptions .",
    "indeed , there are strong absorption bands of co and co@xmath19 around 4.5@xmath11 m , which makes @xmath13 in the 4.5-@xmath11 m band be larger . therefore , the observational result that @xmath13 in the 4.5 @xmath11 m band is larger than that in the @xmath3 band is qualitatively consistent with a co- and/or co@xmath19-containing atmosphere . on one hand ,",
    "the larger @xmath13 values in the optical ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 ) bands compared to that in the @xmath3 band could be explained by rayleigh scattering due to molecular hydrogen or small - sized ( @xmath200.1 @xmath11 m ) haze in the atmosphere , as is the case for hd  209458b and hd  189733b @xcite .",
    "especially , the transition wavelength below which the spectrum begins to rise due to rayleigh scattering is around @xmath159 m for @xmath230.1-@xmath11 m sized haze particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore the observed @xmath13 difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands could be explained well by such a hazy atmospheric model . in figure",
    "[ fig : rprs ] , we also plot a model spectrum which qualitatively fits the data ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "for the model spectrum , we adopt a model provided by @xcite in which a 0.3 @xmath30 solar - abundance atmosphere with @xmath160k containing 0.1-@xmath11 m tholin particles with a density of 1000 @xmath9 is assumed , and scale it so as to fit the scale height of gj3470b .",
    "we note that a quantitative discussion and fine - tuning of this model is beyond the scope of this paper , and to do so , further observational data are required .",
    "the observed @xmath13 variations also indicate that the planet would have no thick clouds in the sky , because if the atmosphere of gj3470b were covered by thick clouds at high altitudes , a much flat spectrum over optical to infrared wavelengths would be observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if true , this fact would offer a wealth of opportunity to probe many molecular features in the gj3470b s atmosphere through high - precision transmission spectroscopic observations , without being prevented by thick clouds . on the other hand , a constant fit to the observed five @xmath13 values",
    "yields the @xmath48 value of 11.6 , meaning that the statistical probability of exceeding this @xmath48 value assuming gaussian errors is 2.1% .",
    "thus , a fully - clouded atmospheric model still can not be ruled out by the current data .",
    "we should note that this is the first report on transit observations by using the 188-cm telescope / isle instrument and the 50-cm mitsume telescope .",
    "our observations for gj3470b demonstrate that these telescopes / instruments are quite useful for studying transiting planets , especially for probing planetary atmospheres by simultaneous observations through the optical to near - infrared wavelengths . nevertheless , the capability of the 50-cm mitsume telescope is limited due to the limited aperture size .",
    "it would be a great capability if 2 - 4 m class telescopes like the 188-cm telescope are equipped with a transit - dedicated camera which can take multi - color images through optical to infrared simultaneously .",
    "the grond instrument , mounted on the mpg / eso 2.2-m telescope in chile @xcite , is a pioneer for such an ambitious instrument , which can obtain seven images through @xmath0 to @xmath161 bands simultaneously for the southern hemisphere .",
    "recently , simultaneous transit observations by using the grond instrument have been reported , demonstrating the usefulness of such a multi - color imager for transit observations . however",
    ", this instrument had originally been developed for catching gamma - ray - burst afterglows and not been designed for high - precision transit observations @xcite .",
    "future developments of such instruments , but more dedicated to transit observations , for 2 - 4 m class telescopes in northern hemisphere will provide fruitful results on the exoplanetary atmospheric studies .",
    "we have presented optical ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) to near - infrared ( @xmath3 ) simultaneous photometric observations for a primary transit of the hot neptune gj3470b , by using the 188-cm telescope / isle instrument and the 50-cm mitsume telescope both at okayama astrophysical observatory .",
    "we have found that the planetary density is broadly consistent with that reported by @xcite ( d13 ) , who measured it based on the @xmath10/irac 4.5-@xmath11 m photometry , confirming its low density .",

    "<S> we derive the planetary mass , radius , and density as @xmath4 @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath7 , and @xmath8 g  @xmath9 , respectively , thus confirming the low density that was reported by demory et al . </S>",

    "<S> , this difference does not alter their conclusion that the planet possesses a hydrogen - rich envelope whose mass is approximately 10% of the planetary total mass . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we find that the planet - to - star radius ratio ( @xmath13 ) in the @xmath3 band ( @xmath14 ) is smaller than that in the @xmath2 ( @xmath15 ) and 4.5-@xmath11 m ( @xmath16 ) bands by @xmath17% and @xmath18% , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a plausible explanation for the differences is that the planetary atmospheric opacity varies with wavelength due to absorptions and/or scattering by atmospheric molecules . </S>",
    "<S> although the significance of the observed @xmath13 variations is still low , if confirmed , this fact would suggest that gj3470b does not have a thick cloud layer in the atmosphere . </S>",
