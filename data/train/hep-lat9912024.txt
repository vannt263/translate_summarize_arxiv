    "@xcite we have found that the vortices undergo a percolation transition which , when there exists a discontinuous phase transition at small higgs masses , accompanies the latter .",
    "the percolation transition persists at realistic ( large ) higgs mass  @xcite when the electroweak theory , instead of a transition , possesses a smooth crossover around some `` crossover temperature '' ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we worked in the @xmath1 formulation of the @xmath2 higgs model .",
    "this report is restricted to results obtained in the crossover regime ( assuming a higgs boson mass @xmath3 gev ) .",
    "details of the lattice model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the defect operators on the lattice have been defined in @xcite . a nonvanishing integer value of the vortex operator @xmath4 on some plaquette @xmath5 signals the presence of a vortex .",
    "the lattice gauge coupling @xmath6 is related to the @xmath1 continuum gauge coupling @xmath7 and controls the continuum limit @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",

    "however , an average over all vortices in a quantum ensemble clearly reveals a structure that can be compared with a classical vortex  @xcite .",
    "we have studied correlators of @xmath4 with various operators constructed on the lattice ( `` quantum vortex profiles '' ) .",
    "classically , in the center of a vortex the higgs field modulus turns to zero and the energy density becomes maximal  @xcite . what can be expected in a thermal ensemble",
    "is , that along the vortex soul the ( squared ) modulus of the higgs field and the gauge field energy density , @xmath13 , substantially differ from the bulk averages characterizing the corresponding homogeneous phase . indeed , in our lattice study they were found lower ( or higher , respectively ) , with the difference growing entering deeper into the `` broken phase '' side of the crossover  @xcite ( see figure  [ rhosg ] ) .    to proceed we have studied , among others , the vortex ",

    "if the quantum vortex profile should interpolate between the interior of the vortex and the asymptotic approach to the vacuum , we can only expect to describe the profile by such an ansatz for distances @xmath23 . the distance @xmath24 ( core size )",
    "should be fixed in physical units .",
    "therefore we choose ( in lattice units ) @xmath25=@xmath26 for @xmath6=8,16,24 which corresponds to @xmath27=@xmath28=@xmath29 .",
    "how successful this is to define the vortex core can be assessed studying @xmath30 _ vs. _ @xmath24 ( to be reported elsewhere ) .",
    "an example of the behaviour of the effective mass @xmath20 is shown in figure  [ vortexemass](a ) .",
    "the mass reaches its minimum at the crossover point @xmath31 .",
    "deeper on the symmetric side the quantum vortex profiles are squeezed compared to the classical ones due to debye screening leading to a smaller coherence length . approaching the crossover from this side the density of the vortices decreases thereby diminishing this effect . the extrapolation of the mass @xmath20 ( as defined at the crossover temperature ) towards the continuum limit is shown in figure  [ vortexemass](b ) .",

    "vortex interactions define the type of superconductivity .",
    "if two parallel static vortices with the same sense of vorticity attract ( repel ) each other , the substance is said to be a type ",

    "p_0_p_r=2 ( g_++-g_+- ) , where @xmath32 stands for contributions to the correlation functions from parallel / anti  parallel vortices piercing a plane in plaquettes @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "properly normalized , the correlators @xmath32 can be interpreted as the average density of vortices ( anti - vortices ) , relative to the bulk density , at distance @xmath16 from a given vortex .",
    "hence the long range tail of the function @xmath33 is crucial for the type of the vortex medium : in the case of attraction ( repulsion ) between same sign vortices @xmath33 exponentially approaches unity from above ( below ) while @xmath34 is always attractive , independently on the type of superconductivity .",
    "we have seen in our calculations @xcite that the tail of @xmath33 belongs to the attraction case ( with minimal slope at the crossover ) .",
