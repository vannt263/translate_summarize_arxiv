    "in recent years the `` cooling flow problem '' has been the focus of intense scrutiny as the solutions have broad impact on our theories of galaxy formation ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "current models predict that the most massive galaxies in the universe  brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs )  should be bluer and more massive than observations find , unless agn feedback intervenes to stop late - time star formation @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of galaxy clusters have given this hypothesis considerable traction . from the properties of x - ray cavities in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , @xcite concluded that agn feedback provides the necessary energy to retard cooling in the cores of clusters ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this result suggests that , under the right conditions , agn are capable of quenching star formation by heating the surrounding icm .",
    "if agn feedback is indeed responsible for regulating star formation in cluster cores , then the radio and star - forming properties of galaxy clusters should be related to the distribution of icm specific entropy . ] . in previous observational work ( see @xcite ) , we have focused on icm entropy as a means for understanding the cooling and heating processes in clusters because it is a more fundamental property of the icm than temperature or density alone @xcite .",
    "icm temperature mainly reflects the depth and shape of the dark matter potential well , while entropy depends more directly on the history of heating and cooling within the cluster and determines the density distribution of gas within that potential .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a large _ chandra _  archival project to study how the entropy structure of clusters correlates with other cluster properties .",
    "@xcite presents the radial entropy profiles we have measured for a sample of @xmath0  clusters taken from the _ chandra _  data archive .",
    "we have named this project the archive of chandra cluster entropy profile tables , or _ accept _  for short . to characterize the icm entropy distributions of the clusters",
    ", we fit the equation @xmath3 to each entropy profile . in this equation ,",
    "@xmath4  is the normalization of the power - law component at 100 kpc and we refer to @xmath5  as the central entropy .",
    "bear in mind , however , that @xmath5  is not necessarily the minimum core entropy or the entropy at @xmath6 , nor is it the gas entropy which would be measured immediately around the agn or in a bcg x - ray coronae .",
    "instead , @xmath5  represents the typical excess of core entropy above the best fitting power - law found at larger radii .",
    "@xcite shows that @xmath5  is non - zero for almost all clusters in our sample .    in this letter we present the results of exploring the relationship between the expected by - products of cooling , _",
    "e.g. _  @xmath1  emission , star formation , and agn activity , and the @xmath5  values of clusters in our survey . to determine the activity level of feedback in cluster cores , we selected two readily available observables : @xmath1  and radio emission .",
    "we have found that there is a critical entropy level below which @xmath1  and radio emission are often present , while above this threshold these emission sources are much fainter and in most cases undetected .",
    "our results suggest that the formation of thermal instabilities in the icm and initiation of processes such as star formation and agn activity are closely connected to core entropy , and we suspect that the sharp entropy threshold we have found arises from thermal conduction ( @xcite , in press ) .",
    "this letter proceeds in the following manner : in  [ sec : data ] we cover the basics of our data analysis .",
    "the entropy-@xmath1  relationship is discussed in  [ sec : sf ] , while the entropy - radio relationship is discussed in  [ sec : agn ] .",
    "a brief summary is provided in  [ sec : diss ] . for this letter",
    "we have assumed a flat @xmath7cdm  universe with cosmogony @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "all uncertainties are 90% confidence .",
    "this section briefly describes our data reduction and methods for producing entropy profiles .",
    "more thorough explanations are given in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "x - ray data was taken from publicly available observations in the _ chandra _  data archive . following standard ciao  reduction techniques",
    ", data was reprocessed using ciao  3.4.1 and caldb  3.4.0 , resulting in point source and flare clean events files at level-2 .",
    "entropy profiles were derived from the radial icm temperature and electron density profiles .",
    "radial temperature profiles were created by dividing each cluster into concentric annuli with the requirement of at least three annuli containing a minimum of 2500 counts each .",
    "source spectra were extracted from these annuli , while corresponding background spectra were extracted from blank - sky backgrounds tailored to match each observation .",
    "each blank - sky background was corrected to account for variation of the hard - particle background , while spatial variation of the soft - galactic background was accounted for through addition of a fixed background component during spectral fitting .",
    "weighted responses which account for spatial variations of the ccd calibration were also created for each observation .",
    "spectra were then fit over the energy range 0.7 - 7.0 kev in xspec  11.3.2ag @xcite using a single - component absorbed thermal model .",
    "radial electron density profiles were created using surface brightness profiles and spectroscopic information .",
    "exposure - corrected , background - subtracted , point - source - clean surface brightness profiles were extracted from @xmath11 concentric annular bins over the energy range 0.7 - 2.0 kev . in conjunction with the spectroscopic normalization and 0.7 - 2.0 kev count rate ,",
    "surface brightness was converted to electron density using the deprojection technique of @xcite .",
    "errors were estimated using 5000 monte carlo realizations of the surface brightness profile .",
    "a radial entropy profile for each cluster was then produced from the temperature and electron density profiles .",
    "the entropy profiles were fit with a simple model which is a power - law at large radii and approaches a constant value , @xmath5 , at small radii ( see  [ sec : intro ] for the equation ) .",
    "we define central entropy as @xmath5  from the best - fit model .",
    "one goal of our project was to determine if icm entropy is connected to processes like star formation .",
    "here we do not directly measure star formation but instead use @xmath1 , which is usually a strong indicator of ongoing star formation in galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is possible that some of the @xmath1  emission from bcgs is not produced by star formation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath1  emission unambiguously indicates the presence of @xmath12 k gas in the cluster core and therefore the presence of a multiphase intracluster medium that could potentially form stars .",
    "our @xmath1  values have been gathered from several sources , most notably @xcite .",
    "additional sources of data are m. donahue s observations taken at las campanas and palomar ( reported in @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . we have recalculated the @xmath1  luminosities from these sources using our assumed @xmath7cdm  cosmological model . however , the observations were made with a variety of apertures and in many cases may not reflect the full @xmath1  luminosity of the bcg .",
    "the exact levels of @xmath13  are not important for the purposes of this letter and we use the @xmath13  values here as a binary indicator of multiphase gas : either @xmath1  emission and cool gas are present or they are not .",
    "another goal of this work was to explore the relationship between icm entropy and agn activity .",
    "it has long been known that bcgs are more likely to host radio - loud agn than other cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , we chose to interpret radio emission from the bcg of each _ accept _  cluster as a sign of agn activity .    to make the radio measurements , we have taken advantage of the nearly all - sky flux - limited coverage of the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , @xcite ) and sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss , @xcite ) .",
    "nvss is a continuum survey at 1.4 ghz of the entire sky north of @xmath14 , while sumss is a continuum survey at 843 mhz of the entire sky south of @xmath15 .",
    "the completeness limit of nvss is @xmath16 mjy and for sumss it is @xmath17 mjy when @xmath18 or @xmath19 mjy when @xmath20 .",
    "the nvss positional uncertainty for both right ascension and declination is @xmath21 for sources brighter than 15 mjy , and @xmath22 at the survey detection limit @xcite . at @xmath23 ,",
    "these uncertainties represent distances on the sky of @xmath24 kpc . for sumss ,",
    "the positional uncertainty is @xmath25 for sources brighter than 20 mjy , and is always less than @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the distance at @xmath23 associated with these uncertainties is @xmath27 kpc .",
    "we calculate the radio power for each radio source using the standard relation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the 1.4 ghz or 843 mhz flux from nvss or sumss , @xmath30 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath31 is the central beam frequency of the observations .",
    "our calculated radio powers are simply an approximation of the bolometric radio luminosity .",
    "radio sources were found using two methods . the first method was to search for sources within a fixed angular distance of @xmath32 around the cluster x - ray peak .",
    "the probability of randomly finding a radio source within an aperture of @xmath32 is exceedingly low ( @xmath33 for nvss ) .",
    "thus , in @xmath0  total field searches , we expect to find no more than one spurious source .",
    "the second method involved searching for sources within 20 projected kpc of the cluster x - ray peak . at @xmath34 , @xmath35 equals 1 kpc , thus for clusters at @xmath36 , the 20 kpc aperture is smaller than the @xmath32 aperture , and the likelihood of finding a spurious source gets smaller .",
    "both methods produce nearly identical lists of radio sources with the differences arising from the very large , extended lobes of low - redshift radio sources such as hydra a.    to make a spatial and morphological assessment of the radio emission s origins , _",
    "i.e. _  determining if the radio emission is associated with the bcg , high angular resolution is necessary .",
    "however , nvss and sumss are low - resolution surveys with fwhm of @xmath37 .",
    "we therefore can not distinguish between ghost cavities / relics , extended lobes , point sources , re - accelerated regions , or if the emission is coming from a galaxy very near the bcg .",
    "we have handled this complication by visually inspecting each radio source in relation to the optical ( using dss i / ii ) and infrared ( using 2mass ) emission of the bcg .",
    "we have used this method to establish that the radio emission is most likely coming from the bcg .",
    "when available , high resolution data from vla first was added to the visual inspection .",
    "vla first is a 10,000@xmath38 high - resolution ( @xmath11 ) survey at 20 cm of the north and south galactic caps @xcite .",
    "first is also more sensitive than either nvss or sumss with a detection threshold of 1 mjy .",
    "luminosity . orange circles represent @xmath1  detections , black circles are non - detection upper limits , and blue squares with inset red stars or orange circles are peculiar clusters which do not adhere to the observed trend ( see text ) .",
    "a2151 is plotted using the 2@xmath39 upper - limit of the best - fit @xmath5  and is denoted by a green triangle .",
    "the vertical dashed line marks @xmath40 . note the presence of a sharp @xmath1  detection dichotomy beginning at @xmath41 . ]    of the @xmath0  clusters in _ accept _ , we located @xmath1  observations from the literature for 110 clusters . of those 110 ,",
    "@xmath1  was detected in 46 , while the remaining 64 have upper limits .",
    "the mean central entropy for clusters with detections is @xmath42 , and for clusters with only upper - limits @xmath43 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ha ] central entropy is plotted versus @xmath1  luminosity .",
    "one can immediately see the dichotomy between clusters with and without @xmath1  emission .",
    "if a cluster has a central entropy @xmath44 then @xmath1  emission is usually `` on '' , while above this threshold the emission is predominantly `` off '' . for brevity",
    "we refer to this threshold as @xmath45  hereafter .",
    "the cluster above @xmath45  which has @xmath1  emission ( blue square with inset orange circle ) is zwicky 2701 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "there are also clusters below @xmath45  without @xmath1  emission ( blue squares with red stars ) : a2029 , a2107 , exo 0422 - 086 , and rbs 533 .",
    "a2151 also lies below @xmath45  and has no detected @xmath1  emission , but the best - fit @xmath5  for a2151 is statistically consistent with zero and this cluster is plotted using the 2@xmath39 upper - limit of @xmath5  ( green triangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : ha ] ) .",
    "these five clusters are clearly exceptions to the much larger trend .",
    "the mean and dispersion of the redshifts for clusters with and without @xmath1  are not significantly different , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , and applying a redshift cut ( _ i.e. _  @xmath49 or @xmath50 ) does not change the @xmath5-@xmath1  dichotomy .",
    "most important to note is that changes in the @xmath1  luminosities because of aperture effects will move points up or down in figure [ fig : ha ] , while mobility along the @xmath5  axis is minimal .",
    "qualitatively , the correlation between low central entropy and presence of @xmath1  emission is very robust .",
    "the clusters with @xmath1  detections are typically between @xmath51 , have short central cooling times ( @xmath52 1 gyr ) , and under older nomenclature would be classified as `` cooling flow '' clusters .",
    "it has long been known that star formation and associated @xmath1  nebulosity appear only in cluster cores with cooling times less than a hubble time @xcite . however , our results suggest that the central cooling time must be at least a factor of 10 smaller than a hubble time for these manifestations of cooling and star formation to appear .",
    "it is also very interesting that the characteristic entropy threshold for strong @xmath1  emission is so sharp .",
    "@xcite have recently proposed electron thermal conduction may be responsible for setting this threshold .",
    "this hypothesis has received further support from the theoretical work of @xcite showing that thermal conduction can stabilize non - cool core clusters against the formation of thermal instabilities , and that agn feedback may be required to limit star formation when conduction is insufficient .",
    "for clusters with @xmath53 .",
    "orange symbols represent radio detections and black symbols are non - detection upper - limits .",
    "circles are for nvss observations and squares are for sumss observations .",
    "the blue squares with inset red stars or orange circles are peculiar clusters which do not adhere to the observed trend ( see text ) .",
    "green triangles denote clusters plotted using the 2@xmath39 upper - limit of the best - fit @xmath5 .",
    "the vertical dashed line marks @xmath40 .",
    "the radio sources show the same trend as @xmath1 : bright radio emission is preferentially `` on '' for @xmath41 . ]    of the @xmath0  clusters in _",
    "accept _ , 100 have radio - source detections with a mean @xmath54 of @xmath55 , while the other 122 clusters with only upper limits have a mean @xmath54 of @xmath56 .",
    "nvss and sumss are low resolution surveys with fwhm at @xmath57 which at @xmath58 is @xmath59 .",
    "this scale is larger than the size of a typical cluster cooling region and makes it difficult to determine absolutely that the radio emission is associated with the bcg .",
    "we therefore focus only on clusters at @xmath60 . after the redshift cut ,",
    "135 clusters remain  64 with radio detections ( mean @xmath61 ) and 71 without ( mean @xmath62 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : radzcut ] we have plotted radio power versus @xmath5 .",
    "the obvious dichotomy seen in the @xmath1  measures and characterized by @xmath45 , is also present in the radio .",
    "clusters with @xmath63 generally have @xmath64 .",
    "this trend was first evident in @xcite and suggests that agn activity in bcgs , while not exclusively limited to clusters with low core entropy , is much more likely to be found in clusters which have a core entropy less than @xmath45 .",
    "that star formation and agn activity are subject to the same entropy threshold suggests the mechanism which promotes or initiates one is also involved in the activation of the other . if the entropy of the hot gas in the vicinity of the agn is correlated with @xmath5 , then the lack of correlation between radio power and @xmath5  below the @xmath65 threshold suggests that cold - mode accretion @xcite may be the dominant method of fueling agn in bcgs .",
    "we have again highlighted exceptions to the general trend seen in figure [ fig : radzcut ] : clusters below @xmath45  without a radio source ( blue squares with inset red stars ) and clusters above @xmath45  with a radio source ( blue squares with inset orange circles ) .",
    "the peculiar clusters below @xmath45  are a133 , a539 , a1204 , a2107 , a2556 , awm7 , eso 5520200 , mkw4 , ms j0440.5 + 0204 , and ms j1157.3 + 5531 .",
    "the peculiar clusters above @xmath45  are 2pigg j0011.5 - 2850 , a193 , a586 , a2063 , a2147 , a2244 , a3558 , a4038 , and rbs 461 .",
    "in addition , there are three clusters , a2151 , as405 , ms 0116.3 - 0115 , which have best - fit @xmath5  statistically consistent with zero and are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : radzcut ] using the 2@xmath39 upper - limit of @xmath5  ( green triangles ) . all three of these clusters have detected radio sources .",
    "finding a few clusters in our sample without radio sources where we expect to find them is not surprising given that agn feedback could be episodic .",
    "however , the clusters above @xmath45  with a central radio source are interesting , and may be special cases of bcgs with embedded coronae .",
    "@xcite extensively studied coronae and found they are like `` mini - cooling cores '' with low temperatures and high densities .",
    "coronae are a low - entropy environment isolated from the high - entropy icm and may provide the conditions necessary for gas cooling to proceed . and indeed , 2pigg 0011 , a193 , a2151 , a2244 , a3558 , a4038 , and rbs 461 show indications that a very compact ( @xmath66 ) x - ray source is associated with the bcg @xcite .",
    "we have presented a comparison of icm central entropy values and measures of bcg @xmath1  and radio emission for a _",
    "chandra _  archival sample of galaxy clusters .",
    "we find that below a characteristic central entropy threshold of @xmath67 , @xmath1  and bright radio emission are more likely to be detected , while above this threshold @xmath1  is not detected and radio emission , if detected at all , is significantly fainter .",
    "the mean @xmath5  for clusters with and without @xmath1  detections are @xmath42  and @xmath43 , respectively . for clusters at @xmath68 with bcg radio emission the mean @xmath61 , while for bcgs with only upper limits , the mean @xmath62 .",
    "while other mechanisms can produce @xmath1  or radio emission besides star formation and agn , if one assumes the @xmath1  and radio emission are coming from these two feedback sources , then our results suggest the development of multiphase gas in cluster cores ( which can fuel both star formation and agn ) is strongly coupled to icm entropy .",
