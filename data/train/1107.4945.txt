    "we denote by @xmath21 the dual lattice @xmath22 of @xmath9 . given a facet @xmath23 of @xmath7",
    "we define its _ primitive outer normal _ to be the unique primitive lattice point @xmath24 such that @xmath25 for some ( uniquely determined ) @xmath26 .",
    "we call @xmath27 the _ local index _ of @xmath23 ; it is equal to the integral distance of @xmath20 from the affine hyperplane spanned by @xmath23 .",
    "reflexive polytopes were first introduced by batyrev in  @xcite in the context of mirror symmetry . in subsequent years",
    "they were intensively studied and classified as important examples of fano varieties in toric geometry , and used for the construction of calabi - yau varieties ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "they are also intimately connected to commutative algebra and combinatorics via the study of gorenstein polytopes  @xcite . here",
    "we present a natural generalisation of this setting , which we hope will be put to good use in future applications .",
    "a lattice polytope @xmath7 is called _ @xmath0-reflexive _ if , for some @xmath28 , the following conditions hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath7 contains the origin in its ( strict ) interior ; 2 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath7 are primitive ; 3 .   for any facet @xmath23 of @xmath7 the local index",
    "@xmath27 equals @xmath0 .",
    "we also refer to @xmath7 as a _ reflexive polytope of index @xmath0_.    the @xmath1-reflexive polytopes are precisely the reflexive polytopes of  @xcite .",
    "note that the requirement that the vertices are primitive prevents multiples of @xmath1-reflexive polytopes from being @xmath0-reflexive .",
    "let @xmath29 be a full - dimensional lattice polytope .",
    "the dual polyhedron @xmath30 is a ( not necessarily lattice ) polytope if and only if @xmath20 lies in the interior of @xmath7 .",

    "clearly @xmath31 is also a reflexive polytope .",
    "this characterisation has a natural reformulation for @xmath0-reflexive polytopes :    [ prop : duality ] let @xmath7 be a lattice polytope with primitive vertices , such that @xmath7 contains the origin in its interior",

    ", @xmath32 is also @xmath0-reflexive .",
    "this induces a natural duality for @xmath0-reflexive polytopes : @xmath33    note that the vertices of @xmath31 are precisely the points @xmath34 , for each facet @xmath23 of @xmath7 .",
    "analogously , the facets of @xmath31 are in one - to - one correspondence with the vertices of @xmath7 .    if @xmath7 is @xmath0-reflexive then @xmath35 , so any vertex of @xmath32 is primitive .",
    "moreover , any facet of @xmath32 is given as @xmath36 for some @xmath37 .",
    "since the vertices of @xmath7 are primitive , it follows that any facet of @xmath32 has local index @xmath0 .",
    "hence @xmath32 is also @xmath0-reflexive .",
    "conversely , suppose that @xmath32 is a lattice polytope having only primitive vertices .",
    "then for any facet @xmath38 we see that @xmath39 is a primitive lattice point .",
    "hence @xmath40 and @xmath7 is @xmath0-reflexive .    finally , since @xmath41 the duality   follows by symmetry .",
    "notice that when @xmath42 we recover the usual duality of reflexive polytopes .",
    "a reflexive polytope ( of index @xmath1 ) does not contain any lattice points besides the origin in its interior .",
    "this is , in general , not true for reflexive polytopes of higher index .",

    "the reader is invited to try to find some @xmath0-reflexive polygons before proceeding . whilst it is not too difficult to find all sixteen @xmath1-reflexive polygons ( draw any convex lattice polygon with no interior lattice points other than the origin ) , it is actually quite challenging to find examples of higher index .",
    "for instance , one quickly suspects that there is no reflexive polygon of index @xmath48 .",

    "we remark that gorenstein polytopes ( lattice polytopes where some @xmath62-multiple is reflexive ) may be regarded as being `` @xmath63-reflexive '' ; they also satisfy a beautiful duality and are related to the construction of mirror - symmetric calabi - yau complete intersections  @xcite .",
    "can we say something similar about `` @xmath64-reflexive polytopes '' ?    as we will illustrate below , we can not expect direct generalisations of most results given in this paper .",

    "since @xmath97 , we observe that a reformulation of theorem  [ thm : number24 ] holds for the @xmath48-reflexive polytope @xmath7 and its dual @xmath82 , where we understand @xmath100 to mean the edge in @xmath82 corresponding to @xmath101 .    in the example above we noted that @xmath97 .",
    "as a consequence , the `` @xmath103-property '' holds for the @xmath48-reflexive polytope @xmath7 .",

    "these are @xmath0-reflexive polytopes with exactly one interior point ; the corresponding toric fano three - folds have at worst canonical singularities .",

    "notice that the @xmath48-reflexive polytope @xmath112 in subsection  [ sec : edge ] is the image under multiplication by a matrix of determinant @xmath127 .",
