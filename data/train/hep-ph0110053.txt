    "the @xmath78 has @xmath82 , so the reaction @xmath83 is allowed by isospin conservation because the @xmath23 system can have i @xmath84 0 , 1 , or 2 . the reaction @xmath85 is forbidden for the usual @xmath5 because the @xmath86 system can only have i @xmath84 0 or 2 .",

    "it is tempting to think that the two neutral pions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are related to each other as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , but there are difficulties in forming such a model .",
    "the present evidence for two distinct neutral pions comes from antinucleon - annihilation reactions , but we believe that most other reactions produce @xmath13 and @xmath14 in equal abundance as occurs for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "since the main difference between the two neutral pions is that one has a lifetime @xmath12  s while the other has a lifetime from @xmath63  s to @xmath64  s , one might think that this short - lived @xmath5 would have been detected in the @xmath5 lifetime measurements  @xcite .",
    "however , because the usual @xmath5 has such a short lifetime , it is difficult to separate it from one with a shorter lifetime .",
