    "[ skizze_3well2 ]    we describe here a qw - qd - qw system with a qd layer ( dwell structure ) designed to emit in the midinfrared and potentially suitable as intersubband - laser gain medium .",
    "[ skizze_3well ] shows a structure designed to rely on electron - phonon scattering for creating inversion in the qds .    for the structure `` a '' in fig .",
    "[ skizze_3well ] we assume a cw field resonant with the transition between the lowest electronic level @xmath0 of the qd and the excited level @xmath1 , @xmath2 , which are degenerate . if a quasi - equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution is maintained in the dwell structure , a population inversion for the optically active states in the qd is not possible in steady - state , so that it is necessary to extract carriers out of the lowest electronic level of the dwell structure .",
    "this is achieved by an additional `` drain '' qw with electronic band edge @xmath3 that is offset roughly by a lo phonon energy from the lowest electronic level @xmath4 in the qd , i.e. , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is smaller than a few mev .",
    "we keep @xmath7 in the calculation because a perfect lineup of the structure is not necessary .",
    "since the wave - functions of the qd and drain qw states do not overlap appreciably , the scattering process is slow compared to a similar scattering process between the extended states and localized states in the dwell structure .",
    "we refer to the extended states in the dwell structure as `` top '' qw even though they are not pure plane waves , but have been orthogonalized to the localized qd levels . in particular",
    ", electron - electron scattering between qd and top qw states for a significant occupation of the top qw is extremely efficient .",
    "if the source for carriers is the top qw , the relaxation from the qd state @xmath0 to the states of the drain qw will be not efficient enough to extract electrons from level @xmath0 , and thus keep the transition @xmath8 inverted .",
    "carrier injection is therefore done in our structure from a second qw , referred to as `` source '' qw with a electronic band edge @xmath9 offset by an lo phonon energy from the excited levels @xmath10 and @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is also smaller than a few mev .",
    "we further assume in the following an energy difference @xmath13 , which leads to a so - called phonon bottleneck effect because transitions between the discrete electron states @xmath14 are inhibited .",
    "@xcite to facilitate steady - state population inversion for the optical active states electron - electron scattering processes that are assisted by transitions in the top qw should be suppressed as much as possible .",
    "this is achieved by the energy difference @xmath15 between the excited qd levels and the band edge @xmath16 of the top qw .",
    "with such a band lineup the carrier - density of the top qw and the electron - electron scattering contribution from this density is kept as small as possible .",
    "with the band lineup described so far , it remains to optimize the injection and removal of carriers for the operation as a light emitter . to this end ,",
    "the source and the drain qw wave functions need to have significant overlap with the qd wave functions , but the layers can not be too close to each other to avoid electrical breakdown between the source- and drain - qw .    as a variation of the structure `` design '' we will also consider carrier removal from the extended states in the top qw in addition to the removal process through the qd states .",
    "removal of carriers is provided through subbands of the surrounding heterostructure . in the structures analyzed here",

    "their theoretical treatment is contained in the following section .    in the semiconductor bloch equations   and",
    "also hartree - fock energy renormalizations arise , which can reach a few mev for highly populated qd states",
    ". however , energy shifts of only a few mev do not affect the scattering behavior significantly .",
    "moreover , the hartree - fock energy renormalization has the same effect on the steady - state result of the population inversion as a slight change of the material composition .",
    "an optimization of the electronic structure including hartree - fock energy renormalizations would require inverse quantum - engineering as described in ref .  , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we therefore neglect renormalization due to coulomb interaction . for the calculation with an optical field in sec .",
    "[ numerical3 ] , we are mainly interested in the qualitative dependence on the optical field intensity , which is treated as a parameter in our calculation .",
    "thus we also neglect hartree - fock contributions that result in and of the rabi energy , which would have to be included in a more comprehensive calculation where the dynamics of the optical field is also included .",
    "the scattering contribution @xmath46 includes both electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering .",
    "our treatment is described in more detail in appendix [ a_scatter ] , where the explicit expressions are given .",
    "here we only summarize our approach .    while electrons interact with longitudinal acoustic ( la ) and longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons , scattering effects due to acoustic phonons in qds",
    "are estimated to be very inefficient,@xcite as long as level spacing of the qds is much larger as the typical energy range of the acoustic phonons coupled to the qds , i.e. , below a few mev in ingaas qds or qd molecules.@xcite    scattering processes involving qd states connect discrete levels so that the influence of level broadening is much more pronounced than for scattering between continuum states in qws .",
    "thus , we follow ref .   and introduce an _ effective quasi - particle broadening _ for the scattering contributions . by using an effective quasi - particle broadening we work with polarons , i.e. , quasi - particles that include the effect of the coupling to phonons , instead of the `` naked '' qd electronic levels .",
    "we have determined this broadening from single - pole approximations to the zero - density qd polaronic spectral functions , see also in ref .",
    ", in the style of ref .   and neglected the coulomb - interaction contribution to the effective quasi - particle broadening .",
    "this is a valid approximation , if the continuum states , i.e. , especially the top qw , are not appreciably populated by carriers , which is necessary if gain , i.e. , inversion , for the optically active transition is desired , see sec .",
    "[ numerical1 ] .",
    "a constant level broadening around @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 , was calculated for typical inas qds .",
    "@xcite here , we assume the level broadening of a typical inas qd , because a precise calculation of the level broadening of the qd in our qw - qd - qw structure is too demanding with respect to computing time .",
    "the qd under investigation has rather a large level spacing .",
    "that is why the stated value for the broadening tends to result to an overestimation .",
    "because a small broadening reduces the electron - phonon relaxation from the excited to the ground state of the qd , the gain is reduced by an overestimation of the broadening .",
    "thus , to be on the safe side its better to slightly overestimate rather than to underestimate the broadening of the qd states .",
    "all in all , the precise value of @xmath51 does not affect the statements of our theoretical analysis , but it is important to get its order of magnitude right .    with the considerations above it turns out that the relaxation or scattering for the carrier distributions can not easily be computed using fermi s golden rule arguments because there is no straightforward energy conservation for transitions between polarons .",
    "thus , the calculated constant level broadening @xmath51 referring to the effect of the electron - phonon interaction on the polaronic spectrum in the form of complex renormalized energies of a single - particle qd state  @xmath52 has to be incorporated into the explicit scattering expressions by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a negligible energy shift ( hf correction and a small correlation contribution ) .",
    "the broadening  @xmath55 of the level @xmath52 is entirely due to correlations .",
    "this incorporation is done by following ref . for the derivation of the electron - phonon and electron - electron scattering .",
    "in contrast to ref .   all coherences are neglected .",
    "this is especially in the case of a small signal gain a valid approximation .",
    "we also assume that only conduction band states are involved in the scattering process , because only electrons in the conduction band are injected and extracted from the system under investigation .",
    "the explicit formula expressions for the electron - phonon and electron - electron scattering is given in appendix [ a_scatter ] .",
    "we next include a simplified model for current injection in the structure described above .",
    "we assume that the current injects carriers into the left side of the structure , i.e. , the source qw , and removes them from the right side , i.e. , drain or top qw .",
    "for an effective injection ( extraction ) of carriers from a qw , energetically close and local nearby subbands have to be provided from the surrounding heterostructure .    for the inclusion of the process , we extend the bloch equations for the source qw , according to ref .  , by a carrier injection term of the form @xmath56 where the pauli blocking factor @xmath57 prevents the pump from injecting carriers in occupied states .",
    "further , @xmath58 denotes an injection rate and @xmath59 is a fermi - dirac pump distribution .    the pump distribution model in the form   attempts to capture in a simple form the details of the injection process .",
    "it is based on the assumption that by the time the injected carriers reach the source qw they have thermalized by collisions and therefore their @xmath60 dependence can be described by a quasi - equilibrium pump distribution @xmath61 with the characteristic carrier density @xmath62 and the characteristic temperature @xmath63 as parameters , which are kept constant .",
    "this distribution is weighted by an injection rate @xmath64 .",
    "the temperature @xmath63 entering @xmath65 is taken to be the lattice temperature .",
    "the pump distribution @xmath65 should not be confused with a fermi - dirac distribution in the qw .",
    "note that we use the injection rate @xmath64 as the independent parameter and calculate the steady - state current density via @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the normalization area of the quantum well .",
    "this expression for the current will be used to compare to similar calculations for quantum well structures in section  [ numerical2add2 ] below .    to model the extraction of carriers by transport of carriers from the drain or top qw to the right side of the structure , we extend the bloch equations for the qws by the simple rate equation @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the occupation of the qw state @xmath60 .    with regard to the injection model",
    "we should also briefly discuss changes introduced to the band lineup in a biased structure .",
    "for realistic fields of several 10kv / cm along the growth axis one expects an energy shift of a few mev between nearby qw and qd states . in agreement with ref .",
    "we neglect these small energy corrections for the thin qw - qd - qw heterostructure under investigation . for a potential drop of more than about 15  mev over the active region ,",
    "the energy difference between the source qw band bottom and the excited qd level becomes too large for efficient carrier injection . in this case",
    "the design of the `` cold '' structure needs to be changed such that the bias - induced shift leads to a level lineup close to the one described in figs .",
    "[ skizze_3well ] and [ skizze_3well2 ] .",
    "in particular , for a field of 36kv / cm as chosen in sec .",
    "[ numerical2add2 ] the `` cold '' structure needs to be changed to a source - qw composition of in@xmath70ga@xmath71as and a drain - qw composition of in@xmath72ga@xmath73as to obtain approximately the same level lineup as described above .",
    "in this section we investigate under which conditions regarding the carrier densities of the qws an inversion between the ground and degenerate excited states in the qds is possible .",
    "therefore we investigate the behavior of the population inversion in the qds for fixed quasi - equilibrium distributions in the qws . because the carrier densities in the qws are kept fixed , no injection ( removal ) processes are included .    in the numerical calculation",
    "we start with given qw carrier densities and an initially empty qd system .",
    "importantly , electron - phonon and electron - electron scattering described by eqs .   and   leads to qd - qw electron scattering as well as intra - qd scattering processes ( see scattering processes ( iii ) and ( iv ) depicted in fig .",
    "[ skizze_qwqdqw ] ) .",
    "the carrier distributions are evolved until a steady - state is reached .",
    "for a weak optical field in resonance with the transition between the lowest and excited states of the qd the steady - state distributions remain unchanged .",
    "the intensity gain for such a weak optical fields is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75mev is the transition energy , @xmath76 ( gaas ) the background refractive index of the host material , @xmath77  @xmath78 the qd density , @xmath79  nm the heights of the active region , @xmath80 nm the dipole moment , @xmath81mev the polarization dephasing and @xmath82 the inversion of the optically active states .",
    "the intersubband dipole moment @xmath80 nm is five times larger than the interband dipole moment for the transition between the electron and hole ground state , which already has an appreciable magnitude .",
    "thus , for the same inversion @xmath82 , the gain on the intersubband transition is larger than that on an interband transition in the qd .",
