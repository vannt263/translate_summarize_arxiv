    "it is straightforward to establish from eq .",
    "( [ enden ] ) that the volume integral of the energy density is not negative : @xmath163 ) that this expression of the energy only vanishes in case of @xmath164 .",
    "this means that the casimir energy @xmath165 of the vacuum is always positive if a non - vanishing periodic electric background field is assumed .",

    "a similar equation appears in the classical case when a certain charge distribution moves in an electromagnetic field . integrating out the effect of the charged particle distribution it will result in a polarisation charge density term beside the common charge density in the equation of motion for the scalar potential . in eq .",
    "( [ mfeq ] ) the term @xmath179 corresponds to a polarisation charge density , so minimizing the energy with respect to @xmath180 leads to an equation similar to that of poisson s equation in a polarised medium .",
    "( [ mfeq ] ) can be solved directly for @xmath178 in principle without the need for solving any other equations .",
    "on the contrary to this the mean field equation ( [ mfeqact ] ) obtained by extremizing the effective action does not take the polarisation of the vacuum into account , in order to do this we have to solve a system of operator equations as well .",

    "it was shown that the necessary conditions of the extremum of the effective action and the minimum of the energy lead to different equations for the vacuum expectation value of @xmath82 .",
    "( [ mfeqact ] ) obtained by extremizing the effective action is the vacuum expectation value of the poisson s equation that does not include the polarisation of the vacuum due to one - loop radiation corrections .",
    "those are accounted for by separate operator equations for the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and for the dirac field . on the other hand eq .",
    "( [ mfeq ] ) obtained by minimizing the energy functional includes the polarisation effects of the vacuum .",
    "the expectation value of the component @xmath1 of the energy - momentum tensor was determined as the function of the amplitude @xmath53 and wave number @xmath181 of the static periodic scalar potential @xmath182 .",
    "it is found that the vacuum configuration with this periodic electric mean field is not favoured energetically compared to the normal vacuum .",
    "the volume integral of the energy density plotted against the amplitude @xmath53 in fig . [ thens ] shows that the energy of the system increases with increasing @xmath53 monotonically .",
    "the result obtained contradicts to our naive expectation discussed in the introduction .",
    "possibly , the reason is that the naive picture mentioned there does not take into account the uncertainty principle i. e. for a certain @xmath69 the energy spread of a wave packet localized in an interval of @xmath183 could be much larger than the amplitude of the potential and of course in this case our naive picture is not valid any more .",

    "this difference will depend on the accuracy of the eigenvalues , the number of the eigenvalues taken into account in the sum , the size of the chosen matrix and , of course , the parameters of the potential , the amplitude @xmath53 and the wave number @xmath69 .",
