    "numerous models of inflation based on effective field theory have been proposed , however , distinct predictions of a given model crucially depend on its ultraviolet completion . to construct a truly predictive inflationary model , it is clearly important to embed it into a consistent microscopic theory of quantum gravity such as string theory .    during the past few years",
    ", our understanding of the various ingredients for obtaining string inflation has been significantly expanded , and many models with increasing sophistication and striking signatures have been proposed ( for recent developments , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in the coming decade , beyond the ongoing sloan digital sky survey  @xcite and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe  @xcite , vastly improved cosmological data will become available from the advanced cmb observations  @xcite , the cmb polarization experiments  @xcite , the dark energy surveys  @xcite as well as the map of large scale structure  @xcite .",
    "they will allow us to constrain the parameter spaces of these models , and possibly to even rule out some of them .",
    "it is therefore of timely interest to perform a thoroughly updated and complete case study in such a direction . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on one of the most developed string inflation models in the literature , usually referred to as `` brane inflation '' .",
    "the original setup of brane inflation first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is to consider a pair of spacetime - filling d3-@xmath0 branes , separated at some distance greater than the local string length on a compact six manifold . as d3 and @xmath0 move towards each other under the coulombic attraction , the canonical inflaton",
    "is then identified as the separation between them .",
    "unfortunately in such a simple setup , the coulombic attraction is too strong for the slow - roll inflation to persist . to overcome this obstacle , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite considered instead placing the @xmath1-@xmath0 pair in a locally warped deformed conifold throat developed in a compact calabi - yau orientifold by background fluxes .",
    "the @xmath0 is then stabilized at the tip of deformed conifold , and d3 is attracted weakly by the warped down d3-@xmath0 potential given by @xmath2 here @xmath3 , @xmath4 $ ] is the d3 brane tension , @xmath5 $ ] is the warp factor at the tip of deformed conifold with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the quanta of nsns and rr three form fluxes , and @xmath8 is the d3-@xmath0 separation .",
    "furthermore , the factor @xmath9 is the universal khler modulus , whose role we shall discuss in detail later .",
    "notice that the first term in ( [ vd3d3bar ] ) gives the positive contribution and uplifts the total potential energy , whereas the coulombic attraction is highly suppressed by @xmath10 and only becomes dominating near the tip of deformed conifold .",
    "eventually when @xmath8 becomes comparable to warped string length @xmath11 , d3 and @xmath0 annihilate through open string tachyon condensation , rapidly terminates the brane inflation .",
    "there are two important further ingredients that have so far been missing in our discussion , and they are crucial for obtaining the inflationary phase and making detailed comparisons with observational data . the first ingredient is the stabilization of both closed and open sting moduli .",
    "they are usually stabilized by the perturbative flux potential  @xcite and the non - perturbative superpotential generated by wrapped branes  @xcite .",
    "the second ingredient is the ultraviolet corrections arising from embedding the warped throat into a compact calabi - yau orientifold .",
    "the bulk fluxes and the distant branes , or additional supersymmetry breaking and moduli stabilization sources can give significant perturbations to the inflaton potential derived from the local sources and geometry .",
    "the warped deformed conifold offers us an ideal venue to analyze these two ingredients .",
    "its explicit metric  @xcite allows for studying the moduli stabilization and the construction of the inflaton potential valid for the _ entire _ evolution , including precise identification of where inflation ends .",
    "furthermore while bulk physics is largely unknown , the spectrum of supergravity states in singular conifold has been tabulated in ref .",
    "the gauge / string duality then allows us to parametrize these symmetry breaking bulk perturbations to the inflaton potential by coupling dual ( approximately ) conformal field theory to these bulk modes  @xcite . combining these with the d3-@xmath0 interaction",
    ", we can schematically parametrize the total potential of the inflaton @xmath12 including both local and bulk effects , experienced by a mobile d3 brane in the warped deformed conifold as @xmath13 here @xmath14 arises from moduli stabilization and @xmath15 encodes all other possible perturbations from bulk physics such that the inflaton mass term @xmath16 is singled out . as @xmath17 is usually a combination of microscopic parameters , for the purpose of full parameter scanning we shall calculate @xmath14 in full detail and express it explicitly in terms of the microscopic parameters while treating @xmath15 as further perturbations . ] .",
    "most of the quantities specifying @xmath14 are exclusively related to the local geometry of the throat , e. g. the warp factor @xmath18 .",
    "however @xmath19 typically also depends on other quantities controlled by bulk physics , such as the one loop determinant of the non - perturbative superpotential .",
    "the quantities controlling @xmath14 are usually treated as free parameters and yield a landscape of possible inflaton potentials .",
    "the current observational data  @xcite enable us to make comparisons with the predictions yielded by different parameter sets and constrain their allowed values . in order for this exercise to be instructive ,",
    "it is crucial to include all the significant contributions to the inflaton potential .",
    "the existing literature in this direction  @xcite has mostly focused on the first two contributions in ( [ totalv ] ) without taking into account @xmath15 .",
    "however in light of recent results in ref .",
    "@xcite indicating that @xmath15 can be generically comparable to @xmath14 , it is clearly necessary to apply such general results and scan the enlarged parameter space to include the bulk corrections .    here",
    "we aim to provide some initial steps toward a complete systematic parameter scanning for warped brane inflation .",
    "we shall first consider a specific brane configuration and stabilize explicitly both universal khler modulus and some of the angular moduli of d3 .",
    "we then construct an example of @xmath20 valid for _ entire _ warped deformed conifold throat .",
    "this potential should be regarded as the infrared completion to the model obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite under the singular conifold limit ( see also @xcite for related work ) .",
    "it allows us to identify the end point of inflation , hence extrapolate precisely to the cmb scale . next we shall briefly review the parametrization of the bulk effects @xmath15 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and discuss the microscopic and observational constraints on the inflationary parameter scanning .",
    "finally we shall first present different degenerate parameter sets such that the resultant @xmath20 yields observationally consistent curvature power spectrum @xmath21 and the corresponding spectral index @xmath22 .",
    "we next demonstrate that the perturbations due to @xmath15 can have significant impact and need to be small to preserve these seemingly optimal parameter sets .",
    "these sample scannings aim to highlight the possible degeneracies and the important role of bulk effects .",
    "in this section , we shall explicitly consider the effects of moduli stabilization on the mobile d3 brane in the entire deformed conifold .",
    "this is important for accurate comparisons between the predictions and the observational data . in particular , this allows us to identify _ precisely _ the end point of inflation @xmath23 , defined to be the point where the slow - roll parameter @xmath24 ^ 2 \\approx \\frac{{m_{\\rm pl}}^2}{2 } \\left [ \\frac{{\\mathbb{v}}'(\\phi)}{{\\mathbb v}(\\phi ) } \\right]^2\\ ] ] becomes 1 so that the universe ceases accelerated expansion . here ,",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 is the field dependent hubble parameter and a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "note that the second approximation holds under the slow - roll limit .",
    "it is crucial to properly take into account the late evolution of the universe during inflation for making correct inflationary predictions .",
    "the form of the potential near the end of inflation can substantially lower the inflationary energy scale  @xcite , and the light fields other than the canonical inflaton can completely dominate the curvature power spectrum @xmath21 and the corresponding spectral index @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the post - inflationary evolution can also modify the spectral index at an observationally detectable level  @xcite .    in the context of warped brane inflation , @xmath27 is driven towards @xmath28 mostly by the d3-@xmath0 coulombic attraction , which is exponentially suppressed and only becomes significant inside the deformed conifold .",
    "moreover , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite when coulombic attraction is insignificant , @xmath27 remains small all the way to the tip for generic parameter sets .",
    "we therefore expect inflation persists well into the deformed conifold region , despite only a proportionally small number of @xmath29-folds is expected to be generated there .",
    "moreover as some of the inflationary predictions are already tightly constrained by observations to high degrees of accuracies , e.g. @xmath21 and @xmath22 , it is important to take into account such infrared completion in constraining the parameter space of brane inflation .",
    "the key component capturing the moduli stabilization effects on the mobile d3 is the @xmath30 supergravity @xmath31-term scalar potential , @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "let us discuss various contributions to ( [ defvf ] ) in turn .",
    "in the presence of a d3 brane , the universal khler modulus @xmath34 depends on the brane position @xmath35 and the usual complex bulk khler modulus @xmath36 . the indices in ( [ defvf ] )",

    "@xcite is invalid for the warped background , hence raises the question about the validity of ( [ eq : kahlerpotential ] ) itself in the warped deformed conifold .",
    "however , some interesting new development in ref .",
    "@xcite about the universal khler modulus indicates that ( [ eq : kahlerpotential ] ) can remain valid in the warped background",
    ". it would be useful to verify this by combining the earlier work on the dynamics of warped compactification , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite with the recent results , ref .",
    "we thank bret underwood for discussing with us about this issue . ] .",
    "to stabilize some of the geometric and khler moduli , we need to consider the total superpotential @xmath43 consisting of two contributions as @xmath44 the first term @xmath45 is the perturbative flux superpotential  @xcite , which allows us ( at least in principle ) to stabilize the complex structure moduli and dilaton - axion .",
    "one mechanism for stabilizing @xmath46 and some of the mobile d3 brane position moduli is to include non - perturbative effects through gaugino condensation on a stack of space - filling d7 branes ( or a euclidean d3 brane instanton ) , as appears in the second term of ( [ eq : superw ] ) .",

    ", we list them below .    *",
    "the string coupling @xmath160 should be small , i.e. @xmath161 to ignore the string loop corrections to the supergravity action .",
    "the physical radius of the three sphere at the tip of deformed conifold is @xmath162 ; thus , we also need @xmath163  @xcite .",
    "* the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath103 should be large such that @xmath164 for valid supergravity solution .",
    "this sets the upper bound on the displacement for @xmath12 , hence the total number of @xmath29-folds .",
    "moreover , the unit of five form flux @xmath165 controlling the size of conifold needs to be large for the supergravity approximation to be valid .",
    "these geometric requirements combine to give a strong bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath97  @xcite , @xmath166 where the @xmath167 sign is to indicate that bulk volume can also give significant contribution to @xmath168 .",
    "this can be obtained from the relation between the four dimensional reduced planck mass @xmath169 and the warped volume @xmath168 of the compact six manifold .",
    "given @xmath170 , the inequality ( [ defmp ] ) implies that warped brane inflation yields negligible tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "* the stabilized volume modulus @xmath114 should also be at large values for the @xmath171 corrections to be suppressed .",
    "this can be ensured by tuning the bulk flux to generate a large hierarchy between @xmath158 and @xmath157 , i.e. @xmath172 , since @xmath173 is typically smaller than 1 so that large @xmath114 can be readily produced . to avoid the backreaction of d7 branes on the deformed conifold , however , @xmath50 should also be such that @xmath174 .",
    "this ensures that the resultant geometry is smooth at the end of duality cascade , rather than cascading into singular conifold throat . * finally , the uplifting ratio @xmath112 is bounded within the range @xmath175 to ensure a small positive cosmological constant at the end of inflation .",
    "the upper bound here arises from preventing runaway decompactification .",
    "such requirement effectively couples the scale of @xmath176 and the scale of the uplifting term(s ) @xmath177 .",
    "in this section we shall first consider some generic features of the inflaton potential ( [ totalv ] ) with @xmath178 , i.e. involving only @xmath20 given by ( [ inflatonpotential ] ) .",
    "in particular , we discuss which parameters listed in ( [ localindepparameters ] ) have more impact on the overall scale or the detailed shape of the inflaton potential , as this is useful for an efficient full parameter space scanning .",
    "next , we shall present some sample parameter sets to demonstrate that @xmath20 can indeed yield observationally consistent results . such scanning for our complete potential",
    "is in line with the existing literature  @xcite .",
    "finally , we shall scan the perturbations due to @xmath15 on these observationally consistent local potential @xmath20 , and demonstrate that bulk contributions generically need to be highly fine - tuned to preserve such results .",
    "let us first consider the amplitude of the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath21 and the corresponding spectral index @xmath22 , which are tightly constrained by recent cosmological observations  @xcite . on the largest observable scales the slow - roll approximation holds at a good enough accuracy ( see later discussion ) , we can express them as @xmath179 at 95% confidence level . here , ( [ obsp ] ) and ( [ obsn ] )",
    "are evaluated at @xmath180 , the value of the canonical inflaton at the cmb scale , and should be determined by integrating backwards @xmath181 @xmath29-folds - fold is supposed to lie between 50 and 60  @xcite . but provided that the curvature power spectrum is nearly scale invariant it does not cause too significant differences .",
    "thus in the remaining text we evaluate @xmath21 and @xmath22 at 60 @xmath29-folds before the end of inflation . ] from the end of inflation .",
    "the inflationary scale is expected to be approximately constant around the cmb scale , and , in particular , for our model , it is expected to occur near the `` inflection point '' where the majority of @xmath29-folds is generated .",
    "explicitly , the combination @xmath182 largely sets the overall scale of inflation in our model .",
    "the deviation from ( [ vmp4 ] ) due to the motion of mobile d3 is essentially a small fluctuation around it .",
    "if the energy associated with the inflaton is too large , this would in fact lead to runaway decompactification  @xcite .",
    "the slow - roll parameter @xmath183 is also small around the cmb scale , but it varies more rapidly than @xmath184 .",
    "we therefore conclude to obtain an observationally consistent value of ( [ obsp ] ) , it is easier to fix the combination ( [ vmp4 ] ) which sets the overall scale , then vary other parameters such as @xmath185 and @xmath186 , which affect the shape of @xmath184 around @xmath187 .",
    "it is also worth noting that while the uplifting ratio @xmath112 or @xmath177 is fixed , one can still vary the ratio between the distant uplifting @xmath188 and contribution from @xmath0 at the tip of @xmath189 .",
    "this also varies the d3-@xmath0 coulombic attraction in ( [ vd3d3bar ] ) .",
    "however , as such highly warped attraction only becomes significant near the tip region , it is important to use the full scalar potential ( [ inflatonpotential ] ) to study any change in the trajectory .",
    "furthermore , at the relatively large distance where the cmb scale lies , the coulombic attraction is effectively absent .",
    "the variation of @xmath190 therefore should not affect significantly the observational predictions ) to study the effects of varying @xmath190 on the trajectory . ] .",
    "this is indeed the case as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure : potential ] and table  [ table : local ] .",
    "now we would like to present some sample parameter scannings for @xmath20 .",
    "the strategy is that we shall further systematically fix the parameters @xmath191 and @xmath112 to some appropriate fiducial values by hand .",
    "this allows us to roughly fix the overall scale of the inflaton potential following ( [ vmp4 ] ) .",
    "we then generate a range of observationally consistent parameter sets by scanning in @xmath185-@xmath186 or equivalently @xmath130-@xmath131 plane .",
    "let us briefly describe how the fiducial values for these other parameters are chosen .",
    "the number of probe d7s @xmath50 can first be fixed to be sufficiently small .",
    "this is because @xmath50 appears mostly with @xmath192 or in @xmath193^{1/n}$ ] . with @xmath194 and @xmath195 ,",
    "the dependence of the inflaton potential on @xmath50 is insignificant comparing with other parameters . to fix the values of @xmath196 and @xmath112 ,",
    "as mentioned earlier that their relative sizes are fixed by compactification constraints ( [ defsigmaf ] ) , we need to set the ratio @xmath197 large to ensure the volume modulus is fixed at large value @xmath114 .",
    "for the actual value of @xmath158 , we note that as @xmath158 is related to the dynamical scale @xmath198 at which gaugino condensation takes place  @xcite , therefore it is necessary to have @xmath199 .",
    "to fix the uplifting ratio @xmath112 , the resultant cosmological constant should be small and positive at the end of inflation , but not necessarily at our current value as , for example , there can be further dynamical processes , e.g. topological changes after inflation , which can change its value .",
    "the specific numerical values for @xmath200 used in our scanning are given in table  [ table : local ] .    with the full inflaton potential given by ( [ inflatonpotential ] ) and ( [ vbulk ] )",
    ", we can _ exactly _ solve the system and subsequently identify where inflation ends , i.e. @xmath201 .",
    "this is most easily done by solving , instead of the friedmann equation , the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath202 ^ 2 - 3{m_{\\rm pl}}^2[h(\\phi)]^2 + \\mathbb{v}(\\phi ) = 0 \\ , .\\ ] ] we can thus calculate the _ exact _ number of @xmath29-folds @xmath203 given by @xmath204 with @xmath183 defined as ( [ srepsilon ] ) and @xmath205 given by solving ( [ hjeq ] ) , and subsequently identify @xmath206 where @xmath207 .",
    "note that for @xmath23 , we explicitly consider two limiting cases , where the uplifting is exclusively by the distant sources or by the warped @xmath0 . as mentioned earlier and checked in our scannings that @xmath208 until the tip of deformed conifold for distant uplifting , thus @xmath209 in this case .",
    "whereas for warped @xmath0 , @xmath23 can also be determined at a small radius by solving ( [ srepsilon ] ) .",
    "essentially we expect that the end point @xmath23 will vary continuously as we dial between the two limit cases .",
    "furthermore , at any viable @xmath206 the potential is very flat so that @xmath210 , we therefore make use of the simplified slow - roll formulae ( [ obsp ] ) and ( [ obsn ] ) to estimate @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , instead of solving the perturbation equations mode by mode .    in table  [ table : local ] , we present three sets of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which give similar predictions on @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath211 .",
    "the values of @xmath212 and @xmath49 are the same in both cases 1 and 2 .",
    "the scanned results suggest that locally there exists a region of degeneracies in @xmath130-@xmath131 plane with the other parameters fixed , as explicitly demonstrated in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ figure : plots ] .",
    "furthermore , if the other parameters are allowed to vary , we can produce similar prediction in an even wider range of parameter sets . a sample parameter set with different @xmath158 and @xmath157",
    "is presented as case 3 in table  [ table : local ] .",
    "note that from fig .",
    "[ figure : plots ] , a fractional change of @xmath213% in either @xmath130 or @xmath131 can easily move the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 to observationally inconsistent regimes . here",
    ", we have scanned only the vicinity of a given @xmath214 , and it is not entirely clear ( although suggestive ) such @xmath215 tuning in @xmath130-@xmath131 plane holds for a wider range . it would be interesting to return to this issue in a more complete scanning in the future .",
    ".three sets of parameters that give the viable values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . we have fixed @xmath216 and @xmath217 for all the cases .",
    "the values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath218 and the non - linear parameter @xmath219 are unobservably small and hence we do not present them here .",
    "the first line of each case corresponds to the complete domination of the distant sources , while the second to that of the coulombic interaction . note that as shown in the first two cases , with a given set of @xmath50 , @xmath112 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , a different combination of @xmath130 and @xmath131 yields similar values of @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "also , in the last case with another set of @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 we can find observationally consistent values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     specifically , from table  [ table : bulk ] , we can see that a very slight disturbance of the bulk effects of magnitude @xmath220-@xmath221 for both @xmath222 and @xmath223 can push the otherwise viable predictions into the regions beyond 2-@xmath42 errors . as @xmath224 is negative definite",
    ", it pushes down the inflaton potential further so that the previously flat region becomes flatter or is even changed into a local minimum .",
    "naturally the amplitude of @xmath21 increases , while @xmath22 deviates further from 1 as the value of the coefficients @xmath222 and @xmath223 get larger . these tendencies are clearly shown in table  [ table : bulk ] . occasionally @xmath225 can improve the relevant predictions to be closer to the current observations .",
    "for example , in case 3 , the bulk terms move the value of @xmath21 to the central value of the observationally allowed region and leave @xmath22 more or less the same with small @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "one may thus hope that by adding @xmath226 to an unviable @xmath20 , observationally consistent results can be obtained .",
    "however , we expect in general @xmath222 or @xmath227 need to be of order @xmath221-@xmath220 to achieve such objective .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed in detail the inflaton potential governing the motion of a mobile d3 in the entire warped deformed conifold .",
    "in particular , we have included both the effects of moduli stabilization and other bulk physics .",
    "we then have performed some sample scannings to demonstrate that without the bulk perturbations , there can be significant degeneracies in the conifold deformation parameter @xmath185 and the d7 embedding parameter @xmath186 for producing observationally consistent predictions . however , as the bulk perturbations are included , we have explicitly shown that their magnitudes need to be @xmath221-@xmath220 to preserve the observationally consistent parameter sets really constitutes a significant fine - tuning , or they are just tied to the choice of having inflection point inflation in the throat . to answer this question",
    "fully , we believe it requires better than our current understanding of uv physics and beyond the scope of investigations here . ] .",
    "the results presented here provide the beginning systematic steps towards a complete brane scanning in the warped throat , and , in particular , highlight the importance of the bulk effects",
    ".    it would be very interesting to follow the steps outlined here and perform a full scanning over the parameters listed in ( [ localindepparameters ] ) .",
    "this clearly requires intensive computational undertakings .",
    "however given the rich parameter space and the degeneracies we have shown in the sample scannings , barring the observation of the primordial gravitational waves , it is likely that there remain significant regions in the parameter space for the warped brane inflation to match the future data .",
    "moreover , a variant of the inflation model presented here is recently proposed in ref .",
    "in such a construction the gravitino mass @xmath228 can be made smaller than the hubble scale @xmath229 , hence circumventing the phenomenological bound given in ref .",
    "it would clearly be interesting to generalize the analysis here and scan the parameter space for such variant , and search for an explicit example of a parameter set that gives tev scale gravitino mass and observationally consistent cosmological predictions .",
