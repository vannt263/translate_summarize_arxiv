    "it follows from the definition that two polygons that are @xmath174-isotopic are @xmath174-equivalent .",
    "the converse is not necessarily true : figure  [ f : visequivalent ] shows three polygons along with their respective visibility graphs .",
    "parts ( a ) and ( c ) are @xmath174-equivalent ( having identical visibility graphs ) but can not be deformed into one another without changing their underlying visibility graphs .",

    "let @xmath191 be the @xmath174-isotopic equivalence class containing the polygon @xmath0 and let @xmath192 be the set of all such equivalence classes of polygons with @xmath5 vertices .",

    "@xmath194 is obtained by adding one more edge to @xmath195 .",
    "2 .   there exists a continuous map @xmath185\\longrightarrow { { \\mathbb r}}^{2n}$ ] , such that @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and for every @xmath196 , @xmath189 for some polygon @xmath0 with @xmath197 , while for every @xmath198 $ ] , @xmath199 for some polygon @xmath16 with @xmath200 .",

    "taking the transitive closure of @xmath202 yields the _ deformation poset _ @xmath192 . a natural ranking exists on @xmath192 based on the number of edges of the visibility graphs .",

    ", we have forgone the labeling on the vertices .",
    "a polygonal representative for each equivalence class is drawn , along with its underlying visibility graph .",
    "each element of @xmath192 corresponds to a complex @xmath14 as displayed in figure  [ f : deformpolyhedra ] . notice that as the polygon deforms and loses visibility edges , its associated polytopal complex collapses into a vertex of @xmath9 .",
    "it is easy to see that the deformation poset @xmath192 is connected : notice that @xmath192 has a unique _ maximum _ element corresponding to the convex polygon . given any polygon @xmath0 in the plane , one can move its vertices , deforming @xmath0 into convex position , making each element of @xmath192 connected to the maximum element .",
    "since the vertices of @xmath0 are in general position , we can insure that the visibility graph of @xmath0 changes only by one diagonal at a time during this deformation .",
    "however , during this process , the visibility graph of the deforming polygon might gain and lose edges , moving up and down the poset @xmath192 .",
    "we are interested in the combinatorial structure of the deformation poset beyond connectivity .",
    "the maximum element of @xmath192 corresponds to the convex @xmath5-gon ( with @xmath204 edges in its visibility graph ) whereas the minimal elements ( which are not unique in @xmath192 ) correspond to polygons with unique triangulations ( with @xmath205 edges in each of their visibility graphs ) .",
    "this implies that the height of the deformation poset is @xmath206 we pose the following problem and close this paper with a discussion of partial results :      we can rephrase this open problem loosely in the deformation context : does there exists a deformation of any simple polygon into a convex polygon such that throughout the deformation the visibility of the polygon monotonically increases ? and moreover , does there exists a deformation of any simple polygon into a polygon with a unique triangulation such that throughout the deformation the visibility of the polygon monotonically decreases ?    for the remaining part of the paper , we focus on the monotonically increasing segment of the deformation problem .",
    "a natural approach is to discretize this problem into moving vertices of the polygon one by one .",
    "so a stronger claim is as follows : for any ( nonconvex ) polygon , there exists a vertex which can be moved in the plane that preserves the visibility of vertices and introduces a new visibility . in other words , for any polygon , there exists a vertex which can be moved such that we can always move up in rank in the poset .",
    "figure  [ f : counter ] provides an elegant counterexample to this claim @xcite , obtained by the participants of the first mexican workshop on computational geometry ( ` http://xochitl.matem.unam.mx/~rfabila/df08/ ` ) .",
    "a partial collection of the visibility edges of this polygon is given in red .",
    "for this polygon , no vertex can be moved to increase visibility without first losing its current visibility .",
    "we do have the following positive result in the special case of _ star _ polygons .",
    "a polygon @xmath0 is a star polygon if there exists a point @xmath208 such that @xmath209 is visible to all points of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a point in the _ kernel _ of @xmath0 , the set of points which are visible to all points of @xmath0 .",
    "choose an @xmath210-neighbourhood around @xmath43 contained in the kernel .",
    "for any @xmath211 , let @xmath212 be a point on the boundary of @xmath0 which is the intersection of the ray from @xmath43 passing through @xmath3 with the boundary .",
    "let @xmath213 and let @xmath4 be the point on the ray from @xmath43 passing through @xmath3 such that @xmath214 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the map from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "we thus construct a linear map @xmath215 \\rightarrow p$ ] where @xmath216 and @xmath217 and where @xmath218 for any two visible vertices @xmath3 and @xmath219 of @xmath0 , consider the triangle @xmath220 .",
    "there can not be any vertices of @xmath0 contained in the triangle . if for any vertex @xmath221 of @xmath0 , the ray from @xmath43 passing through @xmath221 intersects the line segment @xmath222 at a point @xmath223 , then @xmath224 and thus for no @xmath225 can @xmath226 .",
    "so no visibility is lost during the transformation , but notice that @xmath227 is a circle . however",
    ", if we apply @xmath228 only to the vertices of @xmath0 and map any point @xmath223 on an edge @xmath229 of @xmath0 to @xmath230 on the edge between @xmath228 and @xmath231 , we find that we get a polygon at every @xmath30 .",
