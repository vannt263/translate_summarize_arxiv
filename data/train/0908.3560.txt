    "several types of natural and artificial systems have a network structure , where nodes represent typical system units and edges play the role of interactions between connected pairs of units .",
    "this kind of description of complex systems as networks or graphs has attracted much interest in recent years .",
    "thus , complex networks have been used to model various types of real - life systems ( biological , social , economic , technological ) , and to study several processes taking place on them @xcite .",
    "some models of networks have been designed to explain empirical data in various fields .",
    "this is the case of the so - called small - world @xcite and scale - free networks @xcite , which incorporate different aspects of real systems .    in scale - free ( sf ) networks",
    "the degree distribution @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of links connected to a node , has a power - law decay @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this kind of networks have been found in the internet @xcite , in the world - wide web @xcite , for protein interactions @xcite , and in social systems @xcite .",
    "the origin of such power - law degree distributions was addressed by barabsi and albert @xcite , who found that two ingredients are sufficient to explain the scale - free character of networks : growth and preferential attachment .",
    "they concluded that the combination of these criteria yields non - equilibrium sf networks with an exponent @xmath6 .",
    "one can also consider equilibrium sf networks , defined as statistical ensembles of random networks with a given degree distribution @xmath3 @xcite , for which it is possible to analyze various properties as a function of the exponent @xmath2 .",
    "cooperative phenomena in complex networks display unusual characteristics due to their peculiar topology @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ising model has been thoroughly studied in scale - free networks @xcite , and its critical behavior was found to be dependent on the exponent @xmath2 . for finite @xmath7 ,",
    "a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition occurs at a finite temperature @xmath1 .",
    "however , when @xmath7 diverges ( as happens for @xmath8 ) , the spin system remains in an ordered fm phase at any temperature , so that no phase transition appears in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "here we study the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ising model in equilibrium ( uncorrelated ) scale - free networks with several values of the exponent @xmath2 .",
    "this model contains the two basic ingredients necessary to produce a spin - glass ( sg ) phase at low temperature : disorder and frustration . in some spin - glass models , such as the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , all spins",
    "are assumed to be mutually connected @xcite , whereas in others random graphs with finite ( low ) connectivity are considered @xcite . for the afm ising model on scale - free networks ,",
    "we expect to find features intermediate between these two cases .",
    "spin glasses on complex networks have been studied in recent years by using several techniques , such as transfer matrix analysis @xcite , replica symmetry breaking @xcite , defect - wall calculations @xcite , and an effective field theory @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we employ monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to study the paramagnetic to spin - glass phase transition appearing in scale - free networks . in this line , mc simulations have been carried out earlier to analyze spin - glass phases appearing for the afm ising model in barabsi - albert scale - free networks @xcite , as well as in small - world networks @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the networks and the computational method used here . in sec.iii we present results for the heat capacity , energy , and spin correlation , as derived from mc simulations .",
    "in sec.iv we characterize the spin - glass phase through the overlap parameter and transition temperature .",
    "the paper closes with the conclusions in sec.v .",
    "we consider sf networks with degree distribution @xmath0 .",
    "they are characterized , apart from the exponent @xmath2 and the system size @xmath9 , by the minimum degree @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "our networks are uncorrelated , in the sense that degrees of nearest neighbors are statistically independent .",
    "this means that the distribution @xmath13 of degrees of nearest - neighbor nodes fulfills the relation @xcite @xmath14 alternatively , one can use a correlation coefficient @xmath15 defined as @xmath16 where the averages are taken over all links and @xmath17 is the variance of the degree distribution .",
    "this coefficient @xmath15 is zero for uncorrelated networks .    for the numerical simulations we have generated networks with several values of @xmath2 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 .",
    "to generate a network , we first define the number of nodes @xmath18 with degree @xmath4 , according to the distribution @xmath3 , which can be conveniently done by using the so - called transformation method @xcite .",
    "then , we ascribe a degree to each node according to the set @xmath19 , and finally connect at random ends of links ( giving a total of @xmath20 connections ) , with the conditions : ( i ) no two nodes can have more than one bond connecting them , and ( ii ) no node can be connected by a link to itself .",
    "we have checked that networks generated in this way are uncorrelated , i.e. they fulfill eq .",
    "( [ kk1 ] ) , and @xmath21 .",
    "the networks considered here contain a single component , i.e. any node in a network can be reached from any other node by traveling through a finite number of links .    given a network with a particular set of links",
    ", we consider an ising model with the hamiltonian : @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , and the coupling matrix @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 this means that each edge in the network represents an afm interaction between spins on the two linked nodes .",
    "note that , contrary to the usually studied models for spin glasses in which both fm and afm couplings are present , in our model all couplings are antiferromagnetic ( similarly to refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    for a given network ,",
    "we carried out monte carlo simulations at several temperatures , sampling the spin configuration space by the metropolis update algorithm @xcite , and using a simulated annealing procedure .",
    "several variables characterizing the spin system have been calculated and averaged for different values of the considered parameters . for each set of parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath10 , @xmath9 ) ,",
    "1000 network realizations were generated , and the largest networks included 16000 nodes . in the sequel , we will use the notation @xmath27 to indicate a thermal average for a network , and @xmath28 $ ] for an average over networks with a given parameter set .",
    "we present first results for the heat capacity per site , @xmath29 , as a function of temperature for several values of the exponent @xmath2 .",

    "the temperature dependence of @xmath29 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for scale - free networks with various values of @xmath2 between 3 and 10 .",
    "the data shown correspond to networks including 8000 nodes . for increasing @xmath2 , we observe that the maximum of @xmath29 shifts to lower @xmath35 , and the peak becomes narrower .",
    "this narrowing is in line with that observed earlier for the heat capacity in the afm ising model on small - world networks , when the disorder is reduced @xcite . in our case of scale - free networks ,",
    "larger values of the exponent @xmath2 correspond to networks with a higher homogeneity in the node connectivities ( less dispersion in the degree distribution ) , causing a narrower peak in the heat capacity , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the peak shift to lower temperatures suggests a transition from a paramagnetic to a sg phase at a temperature @xmath1 that decreases as the exponent @xmath2 rises . for increasing @xmath2 ,",
    "one reduces the presence of nodes with a large degree , which in turn reduces the degree of frustration in the spin distribution ( see below ) .",
    "afm ordering on the considered random networks with power - law distribution of degrees is frustrated by the disorder in the link configuration , and in particular by the presence of loops with an odd number of nodes .",
    "the degree of frustration can be quantified by looking at the low - temperature energy of the system , which will be higher for larger frustration .",
    "given the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath10 defining the scale - free networks , we obtain a value for the minimum energy by extrapolating to infinite size the minimum energy reached in our simulations of finite-@xmath9 networks .",
    "this extrapolation has been performed by assuming a dependence of the energy on network size of the form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the energy per link for size @xmath9 , @xmath38 is its limit for @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is a fit parameter .",
    "this kind of dependence of the low - temperature energy in spin - glass systems was proposed by boettcher @xcite , and has been found to be followed by the results of our calculations using the simulated - annealing method .",
    "we have checked that our method to obtain a minimum energy for the afm ising model on complex networks gives similar results to those found by using extremal optimization @xcite . in particular , for spin glasses on random graphs with a poisson distribution of connectivities , we found results very close to those obtained by using this technique @xcite . in any case , the energy @xmath41 found here for each parameter set ( @xmath42 ) will be an upper limit for the lowest energy of the system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show results for the minimum energy per link @xmath38 found for three values of @xmath10 and several values of the exponent @xmath2 . for a given @xmath10 one observes an increase in @xmath38 as the exponent @xmath2 is reduced .",
    "this indicates that the presence of nodes with large degree ( hubs ) , which is favored for small @xmath2 , plays in our context the role of increasing the frustration in the spin arrangement . for a given @xmath2",
    ", one observes also in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] an increase in the energy @xmath38 for rising @xmath10 .",
    "this shows that an increase in the minimum connectivity ( or in the average degree @xmath43 ) , causes also a higher frustration in the afm ordering .",
    "a quantification of the short - range order present in the spin system on scale - free networks can be obtained by calculating the spin correlation @xmath44    \\ ; , \\label{xi}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath15 indicates that the average is taken for the ensemble of pairs of sites at distance @xmath15 .",
    "note that the dimensionless distance @xmath15 refers to the minimum number of links between two nodes , also called in the literature chemical or topological distance .",
    "the correlation @xmath45 is shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] for several values of the exponent @xmath2 at a temperature @xmath46 .",
    "this temperature is below the critical temperature @xmath1 of the paramagnetic - sg transition for all values of @xmath2 ( see below ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath45 decreases faster for smaller @xmath2 , due to the presence of nodes with large degree , and consequently a larger frustration of the afm ordering , as discussed above in connection with the minimum energy per link .    to obtain more direct insight into the reduction of @xmath45 with the distance",
    ", we display in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] @xmath47 on a semilogarithmic plot for various @xmath2 values .",
    "in general , after a short transient for small @xmath15 , one obtains an exponential decrease in the spin correlation with distance , as @xmath48 , @xmath49 being a parameter that depends on temperature as well as on the parameters defining the networks ( @xmath10 and @xmath2 ) . for the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we find a parameter @xmath49 that decreases from 1.01(3 ) to 0.386(5 ) when increasing @xmath2 from 3 to 10 , and reaches the limit @xmath49 = 0.321(4 ) for regular random networks with constant degree @xmath50 .",
    "we note that here the limit @xmath51 correspond to networks ( called regular @xcite ) , in which all nodes have the same degree @xmath10 , and consequently do not include any hub with high degree .",
    "in the study of spin glasses , it is usual to consider two copies of the same network , with a given realization of the disorder .",
    "then , one considers a spin system on each network , both with different initial values of the spins , and follows their evolution with different random numbers for generating the spin flips @xcite .",
    "a particularly relevant parameter is the overlap @xmath52 between the two copies , defined as @xmath53 where the superscripts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) indicate the copies .",
    "this parameter @xmath52 is defined in the interval @xmath54 $ ] , and the extreme values 1 and 1 correspond to pairs of networks with the same spin configuration ( apart from a trivial overall flip in the 1 case ) .",
    "we have calculated the overlap parameter @xmath52 for scale - free networks with various exponents @xmath2 , and derived the probability distribution @xmath55 from monte carlo simulations .",
    "results for @xmath55 are presented in fig .",
    "in particular , in fig .",
    "5(a ) we display the distribution of the overlap parameter for networks with @xmath6 at several temperatures . at high temperatures ( @xmath56 )",
    ", the distribution @xmath55 shows a single peak centered at @xmath57 , which is characteristic of a paramagnetic state .",
    "this peak has , however , a finite width , which results to be a finite - size effect .",
    "it should collapse to a dirac delta function at @xmath57 in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "when the temperature is lowered , @xmath55 broadens around @xmath57 , due to the appearance of an increasing number of frustrated links . at still lower temperatures ,",
    "frustration is more apparent , and `` freezing '' of the spins causes the appearance of two peaks in @xmath55 , symmetric respect to @xmath57 , and characteristic of spin - glasses @xcite .",
    "such a distribution @xmath55 is associated to the break of ergodicity occurring in the spin system at low temperatures .    in fig .",
    "5(b ) we show the distribution @xmath55 for three values of the exponent @xmath2 at a fixed temperature @xmath58 .",
    "the effect of decreasing @xmath2 for a given @xmath35 is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) for lowering the temperature for a given @xmath2 , in the sense that in both cases one passes from a high - temperature paramagnetic phase to a spin - glass with broken ergodicity . from the results displayed in fig .",
    "5(b ) , along with those presented in sect .",
    "iii ( specially fig .  1 for the heat capacity and fig .  2 for the minimum energy per link )",
    ", we expect that the freezing of the spins in the sg phase occurs at lower @xmath35 for larger @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , one expects that the transition temperature from paramagnetic to sg will decrease for rising @xmath2 .",
    "the overlap parameter @xmath52 can be further employed to obtain precise values of the paramagnetic - sg transition temperature . to this end",

    ", , \\label{binder}\\ ] ] which is restricted to the interval [ 0,1 ] . on one side , this parameter @xmath60 vanishes at high temperatures , as expected for a gaussian distribution @xmath55 in a paramagnetic state . on the other side",
    ", one has @xmath61 whenever the distribution @xmath55 vanishes everywhere except for @xmath62 , which corresponds to the case of a single ground state , and could be reached at low temperatures . this case ( @xmath61 )",
    "is clearly not expected here due to the onset of frustration , which gives rise to the spin - glass phase .    in general @xmath60 increases as temperature is lowered , and the transition temperature @xmath1 can be obtained from the single crossing point for different network sizes @xmath9 @xcite . by employing this method , we have calculated @xmath1 for scale - free networks with several values of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath2 , and the results obtained are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in this figure , we have plotted @xmath1 as a function of @xmath63 , and the limit @xmath51 corresponds to regular random networks with @xmath64 . this limit gives a reasonable extrapolation of the @xmath1 values obtained for @xmath2 values up to @xmath65 . for a given minimum degree @xmath10 , the transition temperature increases as @xmath2 is lowered . also , for a given value of @xmath2 , @xmath1 grows for increasing @xmath10 , similarly to the case of the minimum energy @xmath38 displayed in fig .",
    "we note that the transition temperature @xmath1 derived from the binder cumulant is in the order of the maximum ( negative ) temperature derivative of the heat capacity @xmath29 for finite networks , as can be seen by comparing results for @xmath66 in figs .  1 and 6 .",
    "the average degree @xmath43 of scale - free networks can be estimated rather accurately by replacing the sum @xmath67 by an integral .",
    "thus , one finds for networks with @xmath0 and @xmath68 , that the average degree scales as @xmath69 from this expression , it is clear that @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "since rising @xmath10 or lowering @xmath2 cause an increase in the transition temperature , we observe that in fact a rise in @xmath43 is accompanied by a rise in @xmath1 .    in this context",
    ", it is interesting to compare our results for @xmath1 in scale - free networks with those found for the paramagnetic - sg transition in other complex networks . in ref .",
    "it was studied the afm ising model on small - world networks generated by rewiring links in a regular lattice @xcite .",
    "it was found that the transition temperature decreases as the disorder ( number of random connections ) increases , in networks where the average degree was kept constant ( @xmath72 ) . in the limit of large disorder ,",
    "those networks approach random networks with a poisson distribution of degrees , and the transition temperature for the afm ising model was found to be @xmath73 .",

    "all this could suggest that the transition temperature @xmath1 is proportional to the average degree @xmath43 , irrespective of the details of the networks under consideration .",
    "this is , however , not the case , as can be inferred directly from the results displayed in fig .",
    ". looking for example at the data for @xmath75 , we observe that going from @xmath6 to the limit @xmath51 , @xmath43 decreases by a factor of 2 ( from 6 to 3 ) . on the other side ,",
    "@xmath1 is reduced by a factor @xmath78 . since lowering @xmath2 increases the inhomogeneity in the degree distribution , favoring the presence of nodes with degree much larger than @xmath43 , we find that this inhomogeneity helps to rise the transition temperature .",

    "@xcite studied the afm ising model on barabsi - albert scale - free networks , and found a paramagnetic - sg transition temperature @xmath79 .",
    "these nonequilibrium networks are characterized by an exponent @xmath6 , and those authors used the particular value of the minimum degree @xmath66 .",
    "for these parameters , we find for equilibrium networks a transition temperature @xmath80 , a value somewhat higher than that obtained in ref . .",
    "we note that the error bar in the transition temperature grows when @xmath2 is reduced .",
    "in fact , the actual value of the cumulant @xmath60 at the crossing point for different @xmath9 values ( network sizes ) decreases as @xmath2 is lowered , and is near zero for @xmath81 .",
    "this coincides with results shown for this cumulant in ref .   for barabsi - albert sf networks , where the value of @xmath60 at the crossing point was less than 0.01 .",
    "this means that the signal - to - noise ratio in @xmath60 becomes poor , and one has an increasing uncertainty in @xmath1 . for networks with @xmath82",
