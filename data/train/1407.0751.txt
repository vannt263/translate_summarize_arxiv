    "multipartite entanglement @xcite is one of the most fundamental and intriguing features of quantum mechanics and a resource for a variety of quantum information processing tasks @xcite . currently , optical quantum systems @xcite are prominent candidates for quantum information processing .",
    "based on the inherent nature of photons , a photon represents a qubit and photons can be made to interact with each other using cross - kerr nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in 2001 , knill _ et al _ @xcite have shown a scalable quantum computation , in principle , with linear optics , single - photon sources and detectors .",
    "motivated by this report , a series of searches for optical quantum information processing have been proposed in succession @xcite .",
    "there are several methods to prepare multi - photon entangled states based on linear optics and cross - kerr nonlinearities . as a standard method , experimentally ,",
    "a parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) source can emit one pair of polarization - entangled photons with a given probability @xcite .",
    "then , one can transform two pairs of polarization entangled photons into three - photon greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite , four - photon ghz state @xcite , hyperentangled state @xcite , and so on . on the other hand , in the regime of weak cross - kerr nonlinearities , one can construct quantum nondemolition detection ( qnd ) @xcite to project signal photons onto a desired subspace . in general",
    ", the signal modes may be fed by several single photons or some entangled photons .",
    "for example , nemoto and munro @xcite proposed a two polarization qubit entangling gate , and barrett _ et al _ @xcite described a method of nondestructive bell - state detection , where the detections of coherent probe beams in two schemes are all homodyne measurement of the position quadrature .    in this paper , we focus on the preparation and purification of four - photon ghz state .",
    "especially , we describe a method to purify the desired four - photon state in depolarization - noise channel .",
    "as is well known , when a short pulse of ultraviolet light passes through the @xmath0-barium - borate ( bbo ) crystal , a pair of polarization entangled photons may be prepared in spatial modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "also , another pair may be emitted in spatial modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 because of the function of a mirror .",
    "we suppose that two independent photon pairs are created in state @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) respectively represent four spatial modes , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) indicates the state of a horizontally ( vertically ) polarized photon . obviously , there are two cases , that is , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the two pairs are superposition of two spatial modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the other two @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "while , for @xmath12 , it means that there is one photon in each spatial modes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .    in fig.1 , each polarizing beam splitter ( pbs )",
    "is used to transmit @xmath13 polarization photons and reflect @xmath14 polarization photons .",
    "the beam splitters ( bss ) represent @xmath15 polarization - independent beam splitters .",
    "the half wave plate @xmath16 is used to convert the polarization state @xmath13 into @xmath14 or vice versa .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are the different spatial modes , respectively . through the setup towards the spatial modes",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 the involved components of eq.([product state ] ) evolve as @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) .",
    "it can be designed to obtain the desired states by a set of fourfold coincidence detections associated with spatial mode @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "specifically , for @xmath11 , after the equipment the satisfactory state reads @xmath34 while for @xmath12 , the state evolves as @xcite @xmath35 then , after four half wave plates and pbss , one obtains the desired four - photon entangled state containing entanglement in both polarization and spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "that is , for @xmath11 , the state @xmath36 can be created .",
    "while for @xmath12 , we obtain the state @xmath37.\\ ] ]    by far , we describe an efficient scheme to create four - photon eight - qubit ghz states which are entangled in polarization and spatial modes .",
    "we derive two representations , which contain all possible cases about emitted four photons , namely , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "in practice , we note that the prepared entangled photons may suffer from channel noise when traveling from a source to a destination ( i.e. , @xmath22 and @xmath21 ( @xmath25 ) ) . because an impact of noise on spatial modes can be easily avoided @xcite , we here suppose that only the polarization entanglement suffers from channel noise @xcite .",
    "the following task of our scheme is to purify the polarization entanglement by using spatial entanglement based on linear optics and multi - fold coincidence detections .    in a depolarization channel , the created entangled states @xmath38 and @xmath39 may suffer from bit - flip and phase - flip errors .",
    "now , let us take the state @xmath39 for example .",
    "we here suppose that two spatial modes @xmath27 and @xmath40 are faultless and only the photons in spatial modes @xmath22 and @xmath21 ( @xmath41 ) suffer depolarization . clearly , the initial state may be transformed to one of the following sixteen four - photon entangled states : @xmath42,\\ ] ] @xmath43,\\ ] ] @xmath44,\\ ] ] @xmath45,\\ ] ] @xmath46,\\ ] ] @xmath47,\\ ] ] @xmath48,\\ ] ] @xmath49.\\ ] ] after the action of the four half wave plates and pbss , as shown in fig.1 , the combined system then evolves as @xmath50,\\ ] ] @xmath51,\\ ] ] @xmath52,\\ ] ] @xmath53,\\ ] ] @xmath54,\\ ] ] @xmath55,\\ ] ] @xmath56,\\ ] ] @xmath57.\\ ] ]    so we can conclude that the errors both from phase - flip and bit - flip can be corrected based on fourfold coincidence detection and postselection . more specifically , after evolution of the equipment , if one of the four - fold coincidence detections @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ( or @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ) clicks , for example , we may conclude that the initial state @xmath66 suffers both phase - flip and bit - flip on one of the polarization qubits and evolves as @xmath67 .",
    "on the other hands , with the fourfold coincidence detector click , the four - photon hyperentangled state collapses into polarization entangle state @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) . in all",
    ", the phase - flip error can be erased in postselection and the bit - flip can be corrected by the following local bit - flip operation , which can be easily realized by some half wave plates .",
    "furthermore , extending the same procedure allows us to analyze the case @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth noting that in order to obtain four - photon ghz states rather than two - ghz - pair states ( entangled state @xmath70 , for example ) there is an additional constraint ( a set of spatial modes @xmath27 and @xmath40 , for example , are faultless ) for @xmath12 , while for @xmath11 there is not the above constraint . at last , without loss of generality , in order to obtain the four - photon polarization - entanglement ghz state @xmath71 , for example , we list the required operations on the four photons corresponding to the results of fourfold coincidence detections , as shown in table 1 .    *",
    "*    .operations on the four photons corresponding to the results of fourfold coincidence detections ( fcd ) for the cases @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 represent the identity operator and bit - flip operation , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "as a matter of fact , if we can not distinguish between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , two cases of the created four - photon , when fourfold coincidence detector clicks we do not tell exactly what operation is required and what state has been prepared .",
    "however , it is noting that the action to distinguish between two cases must not destroy the nature of entangled photons .",
    "thus , it becomes very important to distinguish the two cases in a nondestructive way .",
    "considering for @xmath11 there are two photons in each spatial mode @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , while for @xmath12 there is one photon in each spatial mode @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , one can distinguish between two cases by deciding whether there is one photon in each spatial mode @xmath1 and @xmath3 or not .",
    "now , in the regime of weak nonlinearities ( @xmath74 ) , we design a setup of qnd to determine the four photons created by pdc sources whether in the case @xmath11 or in the alternative @xmath12 .",
    "as shown in fig.2 , signal modes @xmath1 and @xmath3 are two spatial modes of the emitted photons , coherent probe beam @xmath75 followed by beam splitters , two single - qubit phase gates @xmath76s and cross - kerr nonlinearities are used to construct cross - phase modulation , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 are four spatial modes of the probe beams .",
    "after a series of transformations of the setup , the states of the combined system of the two signal modes and the probe beams @xmath77 evolve as @xmath78 respectively . here",
    "@xmath79 represents a two - spatial mode state , with @xmath80 photons in mode @xmath1 and @xmath81 photons in mode @xmath3",
    ". then we introduce an indirect photon number - resolving detection @xcite on spatial mode 2 by using another coherent state @xmath82 . here , the photon number - resolving detection serves two purposes .",
    "it is used to distinguish between the states @xmath83 and @xmath84 but do not distinguish @xmath85 from @xmath86 and project two signal photons onto a desired subspace , simultaneously .",
    "after the evolution of bss and cross - kerr medium followed by a projection @xmath87 on spatial mode 4 , one can obtain specific value of photon number @xmath81 in mode 2 , as described by lin _",
    "et al _ in @xcite . as a result , the value of projection @xmath88 corresponding to a vacuum state project two signal photons onto the state @xmath89 and then conclude that the two pairs are in case @xmath12 . on the other hand , for @xmath90 , two signal photons state",
    "is @xmath91 up to a phase shift @xmath92 , which can be erased according to the classical feed - forward result @xmath81 of the projection @xmath87 , and then claim that the two pairs are in case @xmath11 .",
    "notice that interference occur , in principle , as two photons coming from two different pairs arrive at a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "for the first experimental scheme of four - photon ghz state @xcite or the preparation of four - photon twelve - qubit hyperentangled state @xcite , only fourfold coincidence detections or qnd are used and thus the cases @xmath11 are discarded .",
    "surprisingly , in our scheme the two cases are all collected , and so , in a sense , the present scheme is efficient .",
    "in summary , we demonstrate a method of preparing and purifying four - photon ghz state .",
    "the present scheme has several notable features .",
    "firstly , because it contains two cases , that is , two entangled photon pairs emitted in four spatial modes and alternatively only in two spatial modes , our scheme is more efficient than the conventional schemes .",
    "secondly , we design polarization entanglement purification using spatial entanglement and thus there is a powerful error - correcting capability in noisy channels .",
    "thirdly , by putting an h operation ( a @xmath93 polarizer ) followed by single - photon detectors in the @xmath94 basis in any one set of detectors ( @xmath61 and @xmath65 , for example ) , one can also implement preparation for three - photon ghz state .",
    "finally , the strength of the nonlinearities required for the process of photon number - resolving detection are orders of magnitude weaker than threshold of becoming practical with electromagnetically induced transparency ( i.e. @xmath95 ) . in a word",
    ", we present an efficient preparation and purification scheme for four - photon ghz state with current technology .",
    "also , the present scheme can be easily extended to preparing some other multi - photon entangled states and some other degrees of freedom , frequency degree of freedom , for example .",
