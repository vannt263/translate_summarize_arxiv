    "it has long been appreciated that the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum contains enough information to precisely determine the standard model of cosmology @xcite .",
    "this promise has been realized through a series of increasingly sensitive experiments , most recently with the wmap satellite s 9-year full - sky observations @xcite and the arcminute - resolution maps from the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite and the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite .",
    "the combination of these measurements probes the temperature power spectrum on angular scales ranging from 90 degrees to 4 arcminutes , scales at which the primary cosmological temperature fluctuations dominate .",
    "the primordial fluctuations are well approximated as a gaussian random field @xcite , but act and spt have also detected the non - gaussian features due to gravitational lensing of the microwave radiation by the intervening large - scale structures @xcite . in this letter",
    "we present a joint analysis of the act , spt , and final wmap 9-year power spectra to obtain an estimate of the cosmological parameters from microwave background data alone .",
    "in figure [ fig : data ] we show the compilation of cmb temperature power spectra used in this analysis . at large angular scales we use the temperature and polarization data , and associated likelihood , from the 9-year wmap analysis ( hereafter wmap9 , * ? ? ?",
    "this measures the sachs - wolfe plateau and the first three acoustic peaks , @xmath4 . at smaller scales , @xmath5",
    ", we use data from act and spt .    here",
    "we follow the method introduced in @xcite to estimate the primary cmb bandpowers from both sets of spectra , marginalizing over the possible additional power from galactic and extragalactic emission , and the sunyaev - zeldovich effects .",
    "we use a gibbs sampling method to simultaneously estimate cmb bandpowers and a set of ten secondary parameters . for act",
    "we extract primary cmb bandpowers from the 148 and 218  ghz auto and cross power spectra from two regions ( act - e and act - s , @xcite ) of the sky @xcite , taking the multi - frequency bandpowers in the range 500@xmath610000 .",
    "we include spt 150  ghz data @xcite from 650@xmath63000 , and marginalize over a common model for secondary components @xcite .",
    "we impose a gaussian prior of @xmath7 at @xmath8 on the spt radio source poisson power , having subtracted @xmath9 of cosmic infrared background poisson power , treated separately in our likelihood , from the total expected poisson level @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the resulting act and spt lensed bandpowers are shown in figure [ fig : data ] , and the secondary parameters are consistent with those reported in @xcite .",
    "the errors shown are the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix , with the spt calibration error removed for consistency with act .",
    "the full covariance matrix includes correlations due to foreground uncertainty , beam error , and the overall calibration for spt .",
    "we then construct an act+spt likelihood from these cmb bandpowers , which can also be used for each experiment on its own .",
    "this is a gaussian distribution using 42 data points from act ( 21 each from act - e and act - s ) and 47 from spt , with an associated covariance matrix . for act",
    "we only use @xmath103500 bandpowers in the likelihood , where their distributions are gaussian .",
    "when combining act with spt , we use only act - e data to eliminate the covariance between act - s and spt , which observe overlapping sky regions .",

    "overall calibration errors are not included .",
    "[ fig : res ] ]    the addition of act and spt helps wmap constrain the basic six parameters due to a more precise determination of the higher order acoustic peak positions and amplitudes .",
    "the measurement of @xmath67 improves by a factor @xmath84 and the error on the baryon density is @xmath85 smaller compared to wmap9 alone .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , the increased acoustic horizon scale leads to a predicted distance , @xmath86 , to objects at redshift @xmath87 , in units of the sound horizon at recombination , @xmath88 , of @xmath89 , more than @xmath83 larger than measured by the boss experiment ( @xcite , @xmath90 ) .",
    "the prediction at @xmath91 , @xmath92 , is consistent at @xmath75 with the sdss dr-7 observations ( @xcite , @xmath93 ) .",
    "we find a preference for a scale - dependent primordial power spectrum at @xmath94 from the cmb , with @xmath1 at 68% confidence .",
    "the cmb power spectrum is sensitive to the composition of the universe .",
    "the radiation energy density is the energy density in photons plus the sum of the energy density in relativistic species that do not couple electromagnetically , including standard model neutrinos .",
    "we parametrize the energy density in other relativistic particles through @xmath95 . in the standard cosmological model ,",
    "@xmath96 @xcite describes the three known neutrino species .",
    "if there is an extra neutrino species that decouples at the same temperature as the standard neutrinos then @xmath97 . if , instead , there is another light weakly interacting stable particle that decouples earlier , it will increase @xmath71 by the cube of the ratio of the decoupling temperatures .",
    "the extra energy density in relativistic species has three noticeable effects on the cmb power spectrum @xcite : ( 1 ) it increases the expansion rate of the universe , which impacts both the acoustic and damping scale , an effect that is mostly degenerate with increasing the matter density , @xmath98 ; ( 2 ) it modulates the helium abundance from big bang nucleosynthesis , which in turn modifies the damping tail through free electrons available at recombination ; and ( 3 ) the relativistic particles will free stream out of density fluctuations and suppress the amplitude of the power spectrum on small angular scales ( an effect partially degenerate with increasing @xmath28 , which enhances the amplitude of the power spectrum on those scales ) .    in our analysis , we vary @xmath95 as a free parameter and we assume that the same relativistic species are present at nucleosynthesis .",
    "we keep other quantities that describe the damping tail set to standard values : the total available electron abundance ( determined by the primordial helium abundance @xmath99 ) is consistent with standard big bang nucleosynthesis ; the higher precision determination of recombination is used @xcite , as implemented in @xcite . combining the data we are considering in this work we find at @xmath100 confidence level : @xmath101 in figure [ fig : neff ] we show the distribution for @xmath95 from wmap9 combined with act and spt separately , and together .",
    "there is a @xmath102 difference between the act and spt estimates ; as noted in @xcite , the spt data prefer a higher value , indicating more suppression of the small - scale spectrum .",
    "the probability that this variation is given by statistical scatter is around @xmath103 , @xcite .",
    "based on the difference in the damping tail measurements , @xcite decided to not combine the act and spt data . in this paper",
    "we take a different approach and view the consistency sufficient for combination .",
    "as noted in @xcite , a bayesian model comparison shows no evidence in favor of adding an additional @xmath95 parameter beyond those of the standard cosmology .    the correlations among @xmath95 , @xmath28 , and @xmath104 are also shown in figure [ fig : neff ] ; the suppression of small scale power due to larger values of @xmath71 can be partially compensated by increasing @xmath28 and @xmath98 .",
    "this leads to a larger derived value of @xmath104 if the cmb peak positions are held fixed .",
    "since a higher value for @xmath71 requires a higher matter density today , it gives a higher amplitude of gravitational potential fluctuations and an increased gravitational lensing signal .",
    "measurements of the four - point function of the cmb temperature maps provide a measurement of the lensing deflection signal .",
    "the act @xcite and spt @xcite data constrain the amplitude of the lensing potential power spectrum at @xmath105 to be @xmath106 for act and @xmath107 for spt , yielding a combined @xmath108 . adding this constraint gives @xmath109 consistent with three neutrino species .",
    "current microwave background power spectrum measurements are consistent with the standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model , and independent data sets are consistent with each other , with a mild tension between the act and spt damping tails .",
    "upcoming maps from the planck satellite will provide independent measurements of the same sky regions with excellent foreground characterization .",

    "here we use a slightly adapted binning of the spectra compared to those used in @xcite and @xcite ; this is preferable as it gives the two act regions more similar bandpower window functions .",
