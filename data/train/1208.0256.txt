    "a deconfined state of nuclear matter has been predicted by large - scale numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "utilizing ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision ( urhic ) experiments , this new phase has been identified as a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp )  @xcite . with the advent of lhc , the endeavor of characterizing the properties of sqgp has entered a new stage  @xcite .",
    "heavy quarks , due to their large masses ( @xmath1gev for charm and @xmath2gev for bottom ) , are produced in primordial hard collisions  @xcite , and their number is expected to be conserved in the subsequent evolution of the medium . through interactions with medium constituents ,",
    "the spectra of hqs are modified , yet they may not fully thermalize .",
    "this makes them valuable probes of the hot and dense matter created in urhics  @xcite .",
    "the suppression of non - photonic electrons ( @xmath3 ) from hf decays measured in au+au(@xmath4gev ) at rhic  @xcite is surprisingly large , and their elliptic flow  @xcite indicates a substantial collectivity of charm quarks .",
    "it is difficult to explain these results within perturbative qcd approaches  @xcite for hq scattering in the qgp .",
    "they rather indicate the need for a non - pertubative treatment of hq diffusion in the low- and intermediate - momentum region  @xcite .    here , we report on applications of our recently developed non - perturbative framework for open hf transport in medium  @xcite to @xmath5- and @xmath6-meson observables at lhc , and predict upcoming rhic data for flavor - separated @xmath3 spectra .",
    "the kinetics of hqs in the qgp can be described by fokker - planck dynamics , which in practice is simulated through relativistic langevin diffusion  @xcite .",
    "the required transport coefficient is the hq thermal relaxation rate , @xmath7 .",
    "we employ the results from a thermodynamic @xmath0-matrix approach  @xcite for hq - light quark scattering with input potentials taken as the hq internal energy computed in thermal lattice qcd . while hq - gluon scattering was treated perturbatively in refs .",
    "@xcite , we here adopt a recent update also computed in the @xmath0-matrix formalism  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-matrices exhibit resonant states close to threshold at temperatures @xmath8@xmath9 , which accelerates the hq thermal relaxation by a factor of @xmath103 - 5 for the hq - light quark scattering ( factor @xmath102 for hq - gluon ) over leading order pqcd results  @xcite .",
    "after hadronization , the open hf mesons continue to diffuse in the hadronic fluid .",
    "the thermal relaxation rate of @xmath5 mesons has been calculated by using elastic scattering amplitudes from effective hadronic theory  @xcite . as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the charm diffusion coefficient @xmath11 $ ] is essentially continuous across the phase transition region , possibly indicative of  quark - hadron duality \" .",
    "the @xmath6-meson thermal relaxation rate used is obtained from that of @xmath5 mesons by scaling the relevant mass , assuming they have the same spatial diffusion coefficient ( in the large mass limit ) .",
    "the langevin simulations of hq diffusion in qgp are implemented into the space - time evolution of a background medium modeled by boost - invariant ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) was constructed from a parameterization of recent lattice - qcd data in the high temperature phase  @xcite , combined with a partial chemical - equilibrium eos for the hadronic phase .",
    "a compact initial - density profile with pre - equilibrium flow was introduced resulting in fair fits to multistrange - hadron observables close to the transition temperature , @xmath12mev , and to bulk - hadron observables at @xmath13mev .",

    "it is crucial that the correct thermal equilibrium limit is respected .",
    "we have verified this in the presence of the full space - momentum correlations generated from the hq langevin dynamics and hydrodynamic flow of the thermal light quarks . the relative partition between recombination and fragmentation is determined by a coalescence probability which is obtained from the hq @xmath0-matrix scattering rate , and thus consistent with the underlying transport coefficient  @xcite . at @xmath9 , the in - medium quark and meson masses are used : @xmath16gev , @xmath17gev , @xmath18gev , @xmath19gev and @xmath20gev , with @xmath5- and @xmath6-meson widths of @xmath21gev .",

    "our @xmath5-meson @xmath24 appears to be systematically slightly too high but it reproduces the @xmath15-shape of the data  @xcite rather well , largely induced by the falling momentum - dependence of the non - perturbative @xmath38-quark relaxation rate  @xcite .",
