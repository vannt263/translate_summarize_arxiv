    "the prospects for detecting gravitational waves from the inspiral of compact objects into massive black holes have motivated , over the past decade , research in effort to understand the general - relativistic orbital evolution in such systems .",
    "the underlying elementary theoretical problem is that of a pointlike mass particle in a strong - field orbit around a kerr black hole of a much larger mass .",
    "the dynamics of such systems can be described in a perturbative fashion in terms of an effective gravitational self - force ( sf ) @xcite ; knowledge of this force is a prerequisite for describing the precise evolution of the orbit and the phasing of the emitted gravitational waves .",
    "there is an active research program focused on the development of computational methods and actual working codes for the sf in kerr spacetime @xcite .",
    "this research agenda is being pursued in incremental steps , through exploration of a set of simplified model problems with increasing complexity and physical relevance .",
    "much of the initial work has concentrated on a scalar - field toy model @xcite , but more recently workers have begun to tackle the gravitational case @xcite .",
    "the state of the art is represented by three independent calculations of the gravitational sf for circular geodesic orbits in schwarzschild geometry @xcite .",
    "these calculations use different analytic and numerical methods ( and they even invoke different physical interpretations of the sf ) , but they were shown to be fully consistent with each other @xcite .",
    "these calculations were also shown to be consistent with results from post - newtonian theory in the weak - field limit @xcite .    in the current work",
    "we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter `` paper i '' ) from the special class of circular geodesics to generic ( bound ) geodesics of the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "this generalization is astrophysically relevant because real inspirals often remain quite eccentric up until the eventual plunge into the massive hole @xcite . at a more fundamental level ,",
    "the generalization to eccentric orbits is interesting because it allows us to start exploring in earnest the conservative effects of the sf  for instance , how it influences the orbital precession .",
    "eccentric orbits have already been considered in calculations of the scalar @xcite and electromagnetic ( em ) @xcite sfs by haas . while these calculations are of a less direct astrophysical relevance",
    ", they offer an important test - ground for computational techniques potentially applicable in the gravitational problem too . indeed ,",
    "many elements of our numerical method take their inspiration from haas work .",
    "the numerical code we present here takes as input the two orbital parameters of an eccentric schwarzschild geodesic ( the semi - latus rectum and eccentricity , to be defined below ) , and returns the value of the lorenz - gauge gravitational sf along this geodesic .",
    "the dissipative and conservative pieces of the sf are returned separately . here",
    "we do _ not _ consider the evolution of the orbit under the effect of the sf , but leave this important next step for future work .",
    "we envisage using , to this end , a version of the `` osculating geodesics '' method @xcite , which takes as input the value of the sf along geodesics tangent to the actual inspiral orbit . a systematic framework for analyzing the long - term evolution of the inspiral orbits , using multiple - scale perturbation methods ,",
    "was recently developed by hinderer and flanagan @xcite ( cf .",
    "vii of gralla and wald @xcite ) .",
    "our strategy is similar to that of paper i. its basic elements are ( i ) the lorenz - gauge perturbation formalism of barack and lousto @xcite , ( ii ) a finite - difference algorithm for numerical integration of the lorenz - gauge perturbation equations in the time domain , and ( iii ) mode - sum regularization @xcite .",
    "the perturbation formalism is based on a tensor - harmonic decomposition of the perturbed einstein equations in the lorenz gauge .",
    "the equations are augmented with `` gauge damping '' terms designed to suppress gauge violations @xcite , and are written as a set of 10 hyperbolic equations ( for certain linear combinations of metric components ) which do not couple at their principal parts .",
    "these equations are sourced by the ( tensor - harmonic modes of the ) particle s energy - momentum , modeled with a delta - function distribution along the specified eccentric geodesic .",
    "the equations are solved numerically mode by mode in the time domain using characteristic coordinates on a uniform 1 + 1-dimensions mesh .",
    "the non - radiative monopole and dipole modes can not be evolved stably in this manner ; instead , we solve for these two modes separately in the frequency domain , using the recently introduced `` extended homogeneous solutions '' technique @xcite to cure the irregularity of the fourier sum near the particle .",
    "the code records the value of the perturbation modes and their derivatives along the orbit ( each mode has a @xmath0 behavior at the particle and hence a well - defined value there , as well as a well - defined `` one - sided '' derivatives ) .",
    "these values are then fed into the `` mode - sum formula '' @xcite , which returns the physical sf through mode - by - mode regularization .",
    "one of the primary advantages of the time - domain approach is that eccentric orbits  even ones with large eccentricity  are essentially `` as easy '' to deal with as circular orbits , with computational cost being only a weak function of the eccentricity @xcite .",
    "also , a time - domain code for circular orbits can be upgraded with relative ease to accommodate eccentric orbits ( such a generalization is radically less straightforward in the frequency domain ) .",
    "still , there are several important technical issues which arise in the time - domain upgrade from circular to eccentric orbits , and need to be addressed .",
    "we list some of these issues below .",
    "* most obvious , the computational burden increases significantly because the parameter space for geodesics turns from 1d ( circular ) to 2d ( eccentric ) .",
    "moreover , for each given geodesic parameters the sf becomes a function along the orbit ( it has a constant value along a circular geodesic ) , and one is required to obtain this function over an entire radial period .",
    "the latter becomes a technical hurdle in situations where the radial period is very large ",
    ", close to the last stable orbit , or for orbits with very large radii . * in paper i",
    "we were able to improve the convergence rate of our finite - difference algorithm using a richardson - type extrapolation to the limit of a vanishing numerical grid - cell size .",
    "that was possible because in the circular - orbit case the numerical mesh could be easily arranged such that the local discretization error varied smoothly along the orbit .",
    "this can not be achieved in any simple way when the orbit is eccentric , and as a result one can not implement a similar richardson extrapolation .",
    "the practical upshot is that one is forced to implement a higher - order finite - difference scheme : a 2nd - order - convergent algorithm ( as in paper i ) proves insufficient in practice . for this work we developed an algorithm with a 4th - order global convergence .",
    "the algorithm takes a rather complicated form near the particle s trajectory , where the field ( the lorenz - gauge metric perturbation ) has discontinuous derivatives . to somewhat lessen this complexity ( and reduce the number of grid points needed as input for the finite - difference formula ) the algorithm makes use of suitable junction conditions across the orbit .",
    "the eventual numerical scheme is considerably more sophisticated  and involved  compared to that of paper i. * in the mode - sum scheme one first calculates the contribution to the `` full '' ( pre - regularization ) force from each tensorial - harmonic mode of the perturbation , and then decomposes this into _ spherical _ harmonics .",
    "the necessary input data for the mode - sum formula are the individual spherical - harmonic contributions .",
    "this procedure involves the implementation of a tensor ",
    "scalar coupling formula , whose details depend on the orbit in question .",
    "the coupling formula simplifies considerably in the circular - orbit case ; it reverts to its full complicated form [ eq .  ( [ eq : flfull ] ) with appendix [ app : ffull ] ] when",
    "eccentric orbits are considered . *",
    "the computation of the monopole and dipole contributions to the sf ( which we perform in the frequency domain , as mentioned above ) becomes much more involved in the eccentric - orbit case .",
    "first , the spectrum of the orbital motion now includes all harmonics of the radial frequency , and one has to calculate and add up sufficiently many of these harmonics . a second",
    ", more technically challenging complication arises from the fact that the perturbation becomes a non - smooth function of time across the orbit ( at a given radius ) , which disrupts the high - frequency convergence of the fourier sum at the particle ( a behavior reminiscent of the gibbs phenomenon ) .",
    "a general method for circumventing this problem in frequency - domain calculations was devised recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we implement it here for the first time . * in exploring the physical consequences of the sf it is useful to split the sf into its dissipative and conservative pieces , and discuss their corresponding effects in separate .",
    "this splitting is straightforward in the circular - orbit case : the conservative piece is precisely the ( schwarzschild ) @xmath1 component of the sf , while the ( schwarzschild ) @xmath2 components exactly account for the entire dissipative effect .",
    "this is no longer true for eccentric orbits , where each of the schwarzschild components mixes up both dissipative and conservative pieces , and it is not immediately obvious how to extract these pieces individually . here",
    "we suggest and implement a simple new method for constructing the dissipative and conservative pieces out of the computed schwarzschild components of the sf ( without resorting to a calculation of the advanced perturbation ) .",
    "the method takes advantage of the general symmetries of schwarzschild geodesics .    with the computational framework in place",
    ", we can start to explore the physical effects of the gravitational sf . in this article we concentrate on two such effects .",
    "first , we calculate the loss of orbital energy and angular momentum , over one radial period , due to the dissipative piece of the sf .",
    "we extract these quantities directly from the computed sf along the geodesic orbit ( for a sample of orbital parameters ) .",
    "these `` lost '' energy and angular momentum must be balanced by the total amount of energy and angular momentum in the gravitational waves radiated to spatial infinity and into the black hole over a radial period .",
    "we derive formulas for extracting these quantities from the far - zone and near - horizon numerical lorenz - gauge solutions , and demonstrate numerically that they agree well with the values computed from the local sf .",
    "our values for the energy and angular momentum losses also agree with those previously obtained by others using other methods .",
    "the second effect we consider is conservative , and can not be inferred indirectly from the asymptotic gravitational waves : it is the conservative shift in the location and frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the analysis of the isco shift requires knowledge of the sf along slightly eccentric geodesics near the last stable orbit , and our code provides the necessary sf data for the first time .",
    "we reported the results in a recent letter @xcite , and here we describe our analysis in full detail .",
    "the quantitative determination of the isco shift is important in that it provides a strong - field benchmark for calibration of approximate ( e.g. , post - newtonian ) descriptions of binary inspirals .",
    "our result for the isco frequency shift has already been incorporated by lousto _",
    "et al . _  in their `` empirical '' fitting formula for predicting the remnant mass and spin parameters in binary mergers @xcite ; and by damour @xcite for breaking the degeneracy between certain unknown parameters of the effective one body ( eob ) formalism .    perhaps of a more direct relevance to the problem of the phase evolution in binaries with extreme mass - ratio is the effect of the sf on the periapsis precession of the eccentric orbit  also a conservative effect .",
    "sf corrections to the precession rate have been analyzed for weak - field orbits and within the toy model of the em sf @xcite , but never before for the gravitational problem in strong field .",
    "our code generates the sf data necessary to tackle this problem for the first time .",
    "we leave the detailed analysis of sf precession effects to a forthcoming paper .",

    "<S> we present a numerical code for calculating the local gravitational self - force acting on a pointlike particle in a generic ( bound ) geodesic orbit around a schwarzschild black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is carried out in the lorenz gauge : for a given geodesic orbit , we decompose the lorenz - gauge metric perturbation equations ( sourced by the delta - function particle ) into tensorial harmonics , and solve for each harmonic using numerical evolution in the time domain ( in 1 + 1 dimensions ) . the physical self - force along the orbit is then obtained via mode - sum regularization . </S>",
    "<S> the total self - force contains a dissipative piece as well as a conservative piece , and we describe a simple method for disentangling these two pieces in a time - domain framework . </S>",
    "<S> the dissipative component is responsible for the loss of orbital energy and angular momentum through gravitational radiation ; as a test of our code we demonstrate that the work done by the dissipative component of the computed force is precisely balanced by the asymptotic fluxes of energy and angular momentum , which we extract independently from the wave - zone numerical solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the conservative piece of the self - force does not affect the time - averaged rate of energy and angular - momentum loss , but it influences the evolution of the orbital phases ; this piece is calculated here for the first time in eccentric strong - field orbits . as a first concrete application of our code we recently reported the value of the shift in the location and frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit due to the conservative self - force [ phys .  </S>",
