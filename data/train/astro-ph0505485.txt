    "a thorough understanding of interstellar matter and processes in the galaxy requires a full exploration of all phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in a variety of environments , ranging from the tenuous halo to the energetic nucleus .",
    "diffuse , warm ionized gas is one of the major phases of the ism of our galaxy ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "the warm ionized medium ( wim ) consists of regions of warm ( 10@xmath21 k ) , low - density ( 10@xmath22 @xmath11 ) , nearly fully ionized hydrogen with a scale height of 1 kpc , and appears to be present in every direction in the sky ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the origin and physical conditions within the wim remain poorly understood .",
    "recent observational studies of the wim in the solar neighborhood and in the perseus spiral arm of the galaxy highlight some of the problems , including how lyman continuum photons are able to penetrate the seemingly ubiquitous  to ionize the large - scale wim , and the inability of photoionization models to explain some of the optical line ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the temperature and ionization conditions of diffuse ionized gas in the _ inner _ galaxy are likely to differ significantly from the local conditions , given its higher star - formation rate , larger pressure , and stronger uv flux @xcite .",
    "the presence of the inner galactic molecular ring @xcite , for example , suggests that significant star formation is occurring interior to the solar circle .",
    "investigations of ionized gas through optical emission lines toward the inner galaxy , especially those regions close to the midplane where the ionizing stars are located , were thought to be prohibitive because interstellar dust severely obscures most of the optical light . as a result",
    ", studies of optical and ultraviolet emission sources near the plane are largely constrained to the nearest few kiloparsecs .",
    "a potential alternative to optical studies of ionized gas in the inner galaxy is provided through radio recombination lines ( rrls ) , free - free emission , and infrared emission , which penetrate the interstellar dust .",
    "however , the current sensitivity of rrl and free - free surveys limits these studies to only the brightest regions of ionized gas , with emission measures greater than @xmath23  @xmath24  pc @xcite .",
    "in addition , diffuse emission from rrls may need to be corrected for high @xmath25-level effects in order to derive accurate physical properties of the gas , which may be difficult to estimate @xcite .",
    "free - free continuum emission contains no kinematic information , making it difficult to determine the variations in the properties of the ionized gas along the line of sight .",
    "techniques for the detection and study of infrared emission lines from diffuse ionized gas are under development and are currently limited to emission from hydrogen @xcite .",
    "optical emission line studies , on the other hand , are sensitive to much lower apparent emission measures , down to @xmath26@xmath24  pc @xcite , and often include lines from a variety of ions from which physical properties of the gas may be inferred .",
    "they also have the advantage of being relatively strong and providing velocity information .",
    "the principal problem with optical lines is their sensitivity to interstellar extinction .    to overcome this shortcoming ,",
    "we can take advantage of the highly non - uniform distribution of interstellar dust , which allows us to see further into the plane at some locations compared to others .",
    "baade s window , for example , is a well known region of relatively low extinction , about 1@xmath27  in size , centered near @xmath28 @xcite . with a total @xmath29  of only @xmath30 out to the center of the galaxy @xcite , this piece of sky has been the focus of numerous uv , optical , and ir stellar photometric and spectroscopic investigations used to infer the properties of the galactic bulge ( see review by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while its small galactic longitude makes baade s window well suited for studies of the bulge , the lack of a radial velocity spread toward this direction makes emission line studies of the interstellar medium along the line of sight problematic .",
    "another much larger , and more suitable , window for ism studies lies in the direction of the so called ` scutum star cloud ' .",
    "this @xmath31 diameter ` cloud ' , centered near @xmath32 , is one of the optically brightest regions of the galaxy .",
    "its unusually high apparent stellar density led early astronomers to believe it was a region with an enhanced concentration of stars .",
    "subsequently , uv , optical , and ir spectrophotometry of these stars have shown that this area has unusually low extinction , with an @xmath29  @xmath33 out to a distance of 2 kpc @xcite .",
    "the presence of moderate and high velocity emission resulting from differential galactic rotation , and the observational imprint of dust clouds toward this ` cloud ' , are evident in the recently completed wham survey of the northern sky in h@xmath0  ( wham - nss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . figure  [ fig:1 ] provides an h@xmath0  map from this survey showing the emission at velocities @xmath34  between + 35 kms@xmath22  and + 65 kms@xmath22  toward the inner galaxy .",
    "the h@xmath0  emission is given in units of rayleighs .",
    "in this general direction , these velocities correspond to emission from the sagittarius spiral arm of the milky way , which is at a distance of about 23 kpc @xcite .",
    "the large dark feature extending from @xmath35 to @xmath36 is the aquila rift , a well - known , nearby dust cloud ( @xmath37 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is obscuring the emission behind it with @xmath34  @xmath38 + 25 kms@xmath22 .",
    "the three spectra underneath the emission line map in figure  [ fig:1 ] show more clearly the effect of extinction by dust .",
    "the middle spectrum , toward the scutum cloud , shows not only emission from the local neighborhood ( 0 kms@xmath22 ) and the sagittarius spiral arm ( @xmath39 ) , but the more distant emission from the scutum spiral arm ( @xmath40 ) and all the way out to the tangent point velocity ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the lack of detectable emission at some of these velocities in the other two directions is believed to be caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of interstellar dust . assuming that ionized gas resides in the sagittarius spiral arms at an @xmath42 , the leftmost spectrum shows only the weak emission from nearby interstellar gas in front of the aquila rift .",
    "the rightmost spectrum is in a direction which crosses both the sagittarius and scutum arms , and shows only emission from local sources and the sagittarius arm , with dust extinguishing the emission at larger distances .",
    "the green box in the emission map outlines the low extinction window , which shows emission all the way out to the tangent point velocity .",
    "of course , the h@xmath0  data alone are not enough to confirm that this picture of the distribution of dust along these lines of sight is correct , or that we are detecting emission at large heliocentric distances .",
    "the combination of the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  spectra that extend out beyond the tangent point velocity can verify that increased extinction is indeed associated with the emission at increasingly positive velocities .    here",
    ", we report on the detection of high velocity h@xmath0  and h@xmath1emission from the warm , diffuse ionized gas toward the inner galaxy , including directions toward the scutum cloud , and we investigate the nature of the diffuse ism toward this unique window .",
    "we describe our spectroscopic observations in  [ sec : obs ] , with particular emphasis on the importance of removing atmospheric lines that contaminate the spectra .",
    "we present these results in  [ sec : emission ] , confirming the presence of high velocity h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  emission and discussing their relative strengths . a method for estimating the extinction toward this window , based on the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  spectra ,",
    "is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : ext ] . in ",
    "[ sec : scale ] , we correct the h@xmath0  emission for this extinction and infer some intrinsic properties of the ionized gas , including its density and scale height . a comparison between the diffuse h@xmath0  and  emission in this window is presented in  [ sec : neutral ] , including estimates of the relative column densities and flux of ionizing photons in the inner galaxy .",
    "we compare our extinction measurements with the standard , empirical relationship between @xmath12and @xmath43 along these lines of sight in  [ sec : ebv ] .",
    "we discuss observations of [ ] @xmath18 , [ ] @xmath19 , and [ ] @xmath20 toward a small number of directions in the window and infer some basic physical properties of the ionized gas in ",
    "[ sec : ions ] .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "all of the observations were carried out with the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) spectrometer .",
    "wham consists of a 0.6  m siderostat coupled to a 15 cm dual - etalon fabry - perot system @xcite and produces an optical spectrum integrated over its circular , @xmath44 diameter field of view at a spectral resolution of 12 kms@xmath22  within a 200 kms@xmath22  wide spectral window that can be centered on any wavelength between 4800 and 7400  .",
    "wham was specifically designed to detect very faint optical emission lines from the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "it is located at the kitt peak national observatory in arizona and is completely remotely operated from madison , wisconsin .",
    "the wham northern sky survey ( wham - nss ) , carried out between 1997 january and 2000 april , has mapped the entire northern sky ( @xmath45 ) in h@xmath0  within @xmath46 kms@xmath22  of the local standard of rest @xcite .",
    "one of the many intriguing results from the wham - nss is the significant amount of h@xmath0  emission that appears to extend beyond the survey s positive velocity limit ( @xmath47 ) in a region with @xmath48 , particularly in the general direction of the scutum cloud .",
    "this prompted followup h@xmath0observations obtained between 2002 may and 2002 august that extended the original velocity coverage out to @xmath49 kms@xmath22  over an area within @xmath50 .",
    "because these velocities suggested that this emission may be arising from the inner galaxy , we also obtained h@xmath1  observations toward the same area over the same velocity interval .",
    "the h@xmath1  data allows us to quantify the total extinction and the variations of extinction with velocity along the line of sight , and to verify that the emission is arising from large heliocentric distances .",
    "these new observations were taken in the same manner as the original survey data @xcite .",
    "the observed region was divided into eight observational ` blocks ' , with each block covering a @xmath51 area .",
    "each direction was observed once in h@xmath0  and once in h@xmath1  for 30 sec and 60 sec , respectively . additionally , 13 individually pointed directions , those which showed the strongest evidence of high - velocity h@xmath0  emission , were observed with twice the above exposure times to obtain a higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "these same 13 directions were also observed in the lines of [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] .",
    "all of the spectra were contaminated by several weak atmospheric emission lines that tarnish the interstellar galactic spectra @xcite .",
    "the identification and removal of these terrestrial lines from the spectra is essential in order to compare accurately the spectral profiles and relative strengths of the components . in particular ,",
    "the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  spectra are affected by the relatively bright h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  geocoronal emission lines , produced by the excitation of neutral hydrogen in the earth s atmosphere from scattered solar ly@xmath1 and ly@xmath52 photons , respectively .",
    "an additional challenge in the data reduction was the difficulty in characterizing the continuum , because both interstellar and terrestrial emissions are present almost everywhere across the 200 kms@xmath22  spectral window . for each spectrum ,",
    "a least - squares fit was performed , which consisted of the the sum of a linear continuum , atmospheric lines , and the galactic emission .",
    "the determination of the best fit parameters for each of these components of the spectrum , and the subsequent removal of the contaminating atmospheric lines and the continuum , is outlined below for the h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and other emission line data separately .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the data reduction procedure of wham data can be found in @xcite .",
    "another source of systematic uncertainty is the shape of the underlying continuum due to stellar fraunhofer lines that may be present in diffuse starlight .",
    "this effect has yet to be studied quantitatively .",
    "the large natural width of the strongest stellar lines , as well as the kinematic broadening along a line of sight , reduces the magnitude of this effect .",
    "we see no evidence for significant absorption in our spectra , and have not attempted to make a correction for this effect .",
    "because of our interest in the ratio of the h@xmath0  to h@xmath1  emission as a function of velocity , calibrating the intensities of the two sets of data is important .",
    "the h@xmath0  spectra were calibrated using synoptic observations of a portion of the north america nebula ( nan ) , which has an h@xmath0  surface brightness of @xmath53= 800 r @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath1  spectra were calibrated by separate h@xmath0  and h@xmath1observations of part of the large  region surrounding spica ( @xmath0 vir ) , a nearby b1 iii star . in the absence of extinction ,",
    "the photon number ratio of @xmath53  to @xmath54  from photoionized gas at a temperature of @xmath55 k is 3.94 , set by the ` case b ' recombination cascade of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "we assume that the emission from the spica  region suffers no extinction because of its proximity ( @xmath56 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , high galactic latitude @xmath57 , and the low interstellar hydrogen column density , @xmath58 @xmath59 , to the exciting star @xcite .",
    "combining observations of the spica  region with nan , we obtained a @xmath53/ @xmath54  photon ratio of 5.1 toward nan , consistent with observations of extinction toward stars in the nebula @xcite .",
    "all of the h@xmath1  spectra were then calibrated assuming an @xmath54= 800/5.1 r = 157 r for nan .",
    "in addition , multiple observations of standard calibration directions were observed at different zenith distances to estimate the nightly transmittance of the atmosphere , allowing an airmass correction to be applied to data .    in order to compare accurately the strengths of [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] with h@xmath0 we needed to apply an additional correction for the difference in transmission of the wham instrument at the wavelengths of these lines .",
    "this was done by using the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  calibration , and assuming that the change in instrumental transmission is linear with wavelength .",
    "this correction is largest for the [ ]  data ( 36% ) , and very small for [ ]  and [ ]  ( 3% and @xmath60 1% , respectively ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the response of the spectrometer at the different wavelengths was not formally calculated , and may not vary linearly with wavelength . however , this level of this uncertainty is below the precision of the physical conditions inferred by the data and discussed in  [ sec : ions ] .",
    "in addition , changes in the _ ratios _ of these lines , which reflect trends in the physical conditions , are not significantly affected by this source of uncertainty .",
    "the geocoronal h@xmath0  emission line is the primary contaminant of the h@xmath0  data , with an intensity of @xmath61 r that varies with the height of the earth s solar shadow along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the line has a narrow width of @xmath62 ( fwhm ) , significantly narrower than the 12 kms@xmath22  spectral resolution of wham , and it is at rest with respect to the geocentric reference frame .",
    "the wavelength of this photo - excited transition is slightly different from that of the h@xmath0  produced by recombination @xcite . for these observations ,",
    "the geocoronal h@xmath0  line was significantly brighter than the relatively wide ( @xmath63 ) galactic emission features , facilitating the use of the geocoronal line as a velocity calibration in each spectrum .",
    "however , the motion of the earth with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , for the directions and times of these observations , placed the geocoronal line at a velocity @xmath34  between + 20 kms@xmath22  and + 40 kms@xmath22 , obscuring the galactic emission at these velocities . to remove this geocoronal emission from each spectrum",
    ", we modeled it as a single , narrow gaussian .",
    "a first estimate of the strength of the line was provided by visual inspection of the spectrum and theoretical models of the geocoronal line intensity ( s. nossal , private communication ) .",
    "several fainter atmospheric lines were also present in every spectrum .",
    "these lines have been well characterized through observations near the lockman window , the direction with the faintest galactic h@xmath0  and  emission in the sky @xcite .",
    "these lines are fixed in a geocentric velocity frame , have narrow widths of @xmath64 , and typical intensities of @xmath65 r. the intensity of the lines varies proportionally with the airmass of the observation , and their relative strengths are observed to remain fixed . to correct each spectrum for this effect",
    ", we followed a procedure similar to that for the wham - nss reduction .",
    "we used a single atmospheric line template based on data from @xcite , with one number , a scaling factor , parameterizing the underlying atmospheric line spectrum .",
    "the remaining artifact to be removed from the spectra is the continuum .",
    "as mentioned above , some of the spectra have emission that extends almost all the way across the entire 200 kms@xmath22  window . as a result , estimating the location of the continuum was difficult , and this significantly contributes to the overall uncertainty of the resulting interstellar emission profiles .",
    "we assume that the continuum is linear in shape @xcite , and took advantage of the fact that most of the spectra suffer from relatively high extinction , and do not appear to contain high - velocity galactic emission from the more distant gas .",
    "these spectral regions , which spanned @xmath38  50 kms@xmath22 , were used to estimate the zero point and slope of the continuum , and were consistent with the range of values found for the wham - nss data @xcite . to estimate the continuum for the spectra that _ do _ exhibit high - velocity emission , an average value of the slope and continuum for spectra within the same block , or nearby block observed on the same night , was used .",
    "however , the continuum level and slope is set by the atmosphere as well as the amount of starlight within the beam , which varies from one direction to another .    to remove all of these features from the data",
    ", we took additional advantage of the fact that each direction had already been observed once before in h@xmath0  during the completion of the wham - nss .",
    "these survey spectra have been intensity calibrated and corrected for atmospheric and continuum emission in a more systematic and complete manner , providing an excellent reference for the newer data .",
    "the survey data were also taken at a time when the earth s motion through the lsr placed the geocoronal line at a different velocity in the galactic spectrum compared to the newer data .",
    "we simultaneously fitted a geocoronal line , continuum , atmospheric line template , and wide ( fwhm @xmath66 ) galactic emission components to each spectrum .",
    "the parameters of the fit were first estimated as discussed above . the best fit continuum and atmospheric emission lines",
    "were then subtracted , and the resultant pure galactic spectrum was compared to the corresponding survey spectrum at the overlapping velocities ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "small adjustments ( generally less than 10% ) were then made to the strength of the geocoronal line , the scaling factor for the weaker atmospheric lines , and the shape of the continuum to match the shape of the corresponding survey spectrum .",
    "the remaining difference between the newer data and the survey spectrum , although small ( @xmath68 ) , form the largest part of the uncertainty in the h@xmath0  data .",
    "this systematic source of error comes from small changes in the sensitivity and flat - field of the instrument over a period of @xmath69 years between when the survey data and the newer data were taken .",
    "the h@xmath1  data were corrected in a similar manner as the h@xmath0 .",
    "each spectrum was modeled as the sum of a linear continuum , a narrow geocoronal h@xmath1  line , weak atmospheric lines , and galactic emission .",
    "however , there were no pre - existing , calibrated h@xmath1  data with which to compare these data . as a result , we were unable to remove the atmospheric contaminants and continuum with same accuracy as the h@xmath0  data .",
    "the geocoronal h@xmath1  line is about 10 times fainter than the geocoronal h@xmath0  line @xcite . with @xmath70 r",
    ", it is about as strong as the galactic h@xmath1  emission components , making its precise position more difficult to determine and thus complicating the removal of the line .",
    "a first estimate of the strength and position of the geocoronal h@xmath1line was made by a least - squares free fit to the spectra .",
    "a template of the weaker atmospheric lines was constructed from h@xmath1observations near the lockman window , as was done for the h@xmath0  data .",
    "a single scaling factor was then used to characterize the strength and position of these atmospheric lines in the spectra . identifying the continuum proved to be the most uncertain aspect of the h@xmath1  data reduction .",
    "lacking any pre - existing h@xmath1  observations , we adopted three values of the continuum that corresponded to a ) the best fit to each spectrum and b ) upper and lower limits as suggested by the data itself .",
    "the best fit was one that minimized @xmath71 , and the upper and lower limits placed the data points in the flat portions of the spectra entirely below and above the continuum , respectively .",
    "this conservative estimate for the continuum uncertainty was incorporated into the overall error estimates , and represents the largest uncertainty in the results .    a model fit to each spectrum was then used to remove the continuum and atmospheric emission lines , as was done for the h@xmath0  data .",
    "initial estimates of the parameters of the fit were further constrained by examining the ratio of the h@xmath0  to h@xmath1  spectra .",
    "if the gas is photoionized , then this ratio should remain constant or increase with velocity or path length , corresponding to a constant or increasing amount of dust along the line of sight .",
    "small changes ( @xmath10  10% ) were made to the strength of the geocoronal and atmospheric lines to ensure that the ratio did not decrease , within the uncertainties , over small velocity intervals that corresponded to the position and widths of the atmospheric lines .",
    "the small changes were within the generally observed fluctuations in atmospheric line intensity over the timescale of the observations .",
    "thirteen sightlines were observed in the additional lines of [ ] @xmath18 , [ ] @xmath19 , and [ ] @xmath20 .",
    "these sightlines were chosen based on a preliminary examination of the h@xmath0data that showed the strongest evidence for bright h@xmath0  emission at high velocity .",
    "the relative strengths of these lines with respect to h@xmath0  can be used to estimate the physical conditions of the emitting gas , and to search for potential changes in physical conditions with position in the galaxy .",
    "the quality of these data are not as high as the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  data .",
    "however , they allow us to search for important trends in the line ratios and demonstrate the feasibility of a future , more extensive observational campaign to explore physical conditions in the inner galaxy through nebular emission line diagnostic techniques .",
    "the [ ]  and [ ]  spectra were reduced in a similar manner as the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1 .",
    "they were all taken on one night , with each sightline observed once for 180 sec .",
    "each observation covered a velocity interval between -50 kms@xmath22  and + 150 kms@xmath22  lsr .",
    "to remove the atmospheric lines from these spectra , a template was used as discussed in  [ sec : haobs ] .",
    "emission was present across almost the entire spectrum , and therefore the location of the baseline was difficult to determine .",
    "the strength of the galactic emission was always significantly stronger than the @xmath72 0.1 r atmospheric lines ; therefore , while estimating the strength of the atmospheric lines was difficult , the error resulting from this uncertainty was small . to determine these parameters ,",
    "a least - squares fit to the spectra was performed , where the strength of the template and location of the baseline were changed to minimize the @xmath71 of the fit .",
    "the baseline and template was then subtracted from the spectra . since the atmospheric lines were much fainter than the galactic emission ,",
    "the resulting interstellar emission line profiles are not very sensitive to the particular choice of template strength .",
    "the [ ]  data were taken at two different tunes ( i.e. , two different positions for the center of the spectrometer s 200   kms@xmath22  passband ) to extend the velocity coverage beyond 200   kms@xmath22  and to help in characterizing the baseline .",
    "each direction was observed twice at each tune for 120 sec at a time .",
    "the spectra for each sightline at a given tune were averaged together , with the spectra at the different tunes stitched together .",
    "the velocity calibration was determined using a semi - empirical prediction based on the pressures of the two etalons .",
    "an attempt was made to remove the atmospheric lines based on a template .",
    "however , for several spectra the galactic emission intensity was only comparable to or less than the atmospheric lines , so that small variations in the unknown strength of the atmospheric lines yielded very large uncertainties in the galactic emission . therefore , for the [ ]  spectra , we adopted an on - off technique , whereby we subtracted one of the [ ]  spectra from the rest of the spectra .",
    "the off spectrum that was subtracted from the other spectra was toward ( 28@xmath27 , -2.6@xmath27 ) .",
    "this direction is close to the galactic plane where the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  data suggested the @xmath29  is high , and therefore the galactic [ ]  emission is likely very weak , particularly from the sagittarius and scutum arms at @xmath34  @xmath38 50   kms@xmath22 .",
    "since this spectrum was taken close to the other spectra in space and time , the atmospheric lines were accurately removed by this subtraction .",
    "this technique underestimates the galactic [ ] emission , particularly near the lsr , since there may be some galactic emission toward the off direction .",
    "the spatial distribution of the highest velocity h@xmath0  and h@xmath1emission is shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "these velocity channel maps cover a smaller area than shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] and highlight the region surrounding the low extinction window . both of the maps display emission integrated over the velocity range of @xmath73 , revealing a bright region centered near @xmath74 .",
    "the color scaling in figure  [ fig:2 ] has been histogram equalized to enhance the contrast of the features in the map .",
    "the morphology of the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  maps are very similar , with a faint halo of emission extending to the south of the brightest knot , and a patchy filament of emission near @xmath75 .",
    "the spectra toward this bright region , at longitudes @xmath76 , reveal distinct emission components centered near @xmath77 ( see figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the patchy spots of high velocity emission at lower longitudes ( @xmath78 ) , closer to the galactic center , are from the wings of much stronger emission centered at lower velocities . at these high velocities ,",
    "the h@xmath1  emission relative to the h@xmath0emission is about 2.5 times fainter than that predicted for ionized gas with no extinction @xcite , indicating a higher extinction for this gas compared to gas at lower velocities .",
    "( see  [ sec : ext ] below ) .",
    "a combination of spatial and spectral information about this high velocity emission is shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "fifty one directions were selected as having significant emission beyond @xmath34= + 85 kms@xmath22 , based on a visual inspection of figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  spectra toward each of these 51 directions is shown , with their position within this figure given by their galactic coordinates .",
    "the horizontal axis of each spectrum is the radial velocity @xmath34 , spanning a range of @xmath79  for each spectrum .",
    "the vertical axes are in arbitrary units , and determined individually from the intrinsic brightness of the lines . in two cases ,",
    "no reliable h@xmath1  spectra were available and are omitted from the figure .",
    "the h@xmath1  spectra are represented by the weaker , noisier dark lines , and have been multiplied by 3.94 , the expected @xmath53/ @xmath54photon ratio in the absence of extinction .",
    "most spectra have two strong , discrete emission features , centered near @xmath80 and @xmath77 .",
    "the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  spectra decrease in intensity away from the galactic plane , and the relative strengths of the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  lines also show that there is less extinction farther from the plane and at lower velocities .",
    "a formal multi - component fit was also made to each of the h@xmath0  spectra in figure  [ fig:3 ] , from which additional information about the nature of the emission and extinction within the window was obtained ( see  [ sec : ext ] below ) .",
    "each reduced spectrum was modeled as the sum of multiple gaussian components , using a @xmath71 minimization scheme similar to the data reduction procedure in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the fitted velocity of each component was recorded , and a histogram of those velocities appears in figure  [ fig:4 ] . on average ,",
    "five components were required for a good fit to each spectrum . the full - width half - max ( fwhm ) of each component",
    "was fixed at @xmath81 .",
    "this is the typical width of an h@xmath0  line in the wham - nss , and is a combination of thermal ( @xmath82k ) and non - thermal ( @xmath83 ) broadening @xcite .",
    "the structure of the histogram was not significantly altered when we allowed the widths of the components to be a free parameter , but not fixing the widths did complicate the fitting procedure , especially for faint , overlapping components .",
    "the width of the bins in figure  [ fig:4 ] is @xmath84 , half of the fwhm of the components and also the approximate spectral resolution of the wham instrument .",
    "the histogram in figure  [ fig:4 ] reveals a strong peak near @xmath34= 0 kms@xmath22 , which is emission from the local solar neighborhood .",
    "it is interesting to note that the peak is slightly red - shifted , consistent with the gas being just interior to the solar circle at these longitudes following a flat rotation curve .",
    "there is a second peak near @xmath85 , which can be interpreted as emission from the sagittarius spiral arm . beyond @xmath80",
    ", there is a wide range of velocities all the way out to the tangent point velocity ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "there is marginal evidence for a concentration of velocity peaks near @xmath87 , the expected kinematic signature of the scutum spiral arm .",
    "the small number of velocity peaks at @xmath34  @xmath88  + 120 kms@xmath22  beyond the tangent point velocity are associated with very faint ( @xmath89 r ) emission and were necessary for a good fit to the data .",
    "we note , however , these components may not be physical , and could be part of a higher velocity tail of emission from components at lower velocities with widths greater than @xmath81 . on the other hand , at least some of these highest velocity components do appear to be associated with gas near the tangent point but with a velocity in excess of that associated with circular rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to characterize further the nature of this high - velocity emission region , we combined the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  data to examine the role of dust extinction along each line of sight .",
    "an optically thin photoionized gas at a temperature @xmath90  k has an intrinsic line ratio of @xmath53/ @xmath54  = 3.94 in photon units @xcite ; this ratio is only weakly dependent on temperature ( @xmath91 ) and density .",
    "hydrogen gas ionized by other processes , such as shocks , will not emit h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  photons in the ratio given above .",
    "however , strong shocks from rare supernovae and weaker shocks from spiral arms do not provide enough power to sustain the ionization observed in the general wim @xcite , and therefore we will assume that the diffuse gas observed here is photoionized , and that the recombination ratio @xmath53/ @xmath54  can be used to infer the extinction .",
    "consider a line of sight with an optical depth @xmath92 at h@xmath0  and @xmath93 at h@xmath1  out to a point source of emission with an intrinsic brightness @xmath94 at h@xmath0  and @xmath95 at h@xmath1 .",
    "the ratio of the intensities of the two observed lines is @xmath96 we replace the intrinsic line ratio @xmath94/@xmath95 with 3.94 from above , to obtain @xmath97 the ratio of @xmath98 depends on the detailed absorption and scattering characteristics of the dust along the line of sight .",
    "however , extinction curves measured in the diffuse ism of the galaxy suggest that a fairly well defined relationship exists between the ratio of extinction at one wavelength compared to another .",
    "@xcite , for example , have developed semi - analytical fits to observed extinction curves which parameterizes these ratios through a single scaling factor , the total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath99 . for an @xmath100 , typical of the diffuse ism , the ratio of the optical depths @xmath98 = 0.70 . to convert the optical depth at h@xmath1  to the more standard quantity of extinction in the johnson @xmath101 band",
    ", we note that the ratio of optical depths @xmath102 = 1.16 . with the above relationships , and converting @xmath103 into magnitudes of extinction @xmath29 through the relation @xmath104",
    ", we obtain @xmath29 as a function of the observed @xmath53/ @xmath54  line ratio : @xmath105    note that observations of @xmath53  and @xmath54  are equivalent to the color excess , or the relative extinction , of the emitting gas . using equation  ( [ eq:2 - 3 ] ) with the definition of color excess , we see that ln@xmath106 = ( 1/1.086)\\ e(h\\beta - h\\alpha)$ ] .",
    "normalized extinction curves in the galaxy , which quantify the relationship between @xmath107 and @xmath108 , are linear at optical wavelengths , and the slope of this line in the optical is not very sensitive to @xmath109 ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , since the difference in the inverse wavelengths between h@xmath0  and h@xmath1 , is about the same as the difference between the johnson @xmath110 and @xmath101 bands , the color excess @xmath111 is similar in value to the commonly measured color excess @xmath12 . using the analytic formalism of @xcite ,",
    "the ratio of the two color excesses are @xmath112 thus @xmath113 and @xmath12 differ only by 10% for an @xmath100 , and never depart from each other by more than 30% for all values of @xmath109 in the galaxy ( @xmath114 ) . as a result ,",
    "observations of @xmath53/ @xmath54  can be used to infer the equivalent value of the color excess @xmath12  with an uncertainty of @xmath115 . however",
    ", a value of @xmath109 is required in order to quantify the _ total _ extinction to the emitting source , @xmath29 .",
    "we note that there is growing evidence that @xmath109 may be systematically lower in the inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and radio observations of planetary nebulae toward the galactic bulge suggest that @xmath109 may be as low as 2.0 @xcite . however , there is considerable uncertainty in the distances to these pne , their association with the bulge , and the derived values of @xmath109 .",
    "our discussion of @xmath29  below assumes a standard @xmath109 = 3.1 , but we note that this value may decrease with galactocentric radius .",
    "the discussion above holds true in cases where the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1emission comes from a point source and is subsequently removed from the observer s beam through dust absorption and scattering out of the line of sight .",
    "our observations , however , are of _ diffuse _ emission . in this case",
    ", dust can scatter diffuse light originating from another direction back _ into _ our 1@xmath27  diameter beam and @xmath53/ @xmath54  is a measure of the attenuation rather than extinction .",
    "this scattering effect complicates the conversion between the observed @xmath53/ @xmath54  line ratio and the standard definition of interstellar extinction . in order to quantify this effect accurately ,",
    "detailed radiative transfer models are required , which incorporate the ( unknown ) distribution of dust and emission , as well as poorly - constrained dust scattering properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this effect is expected to be minimal for emission sources that subtend solid angles that are small compared to the typical scattering angle , which is @xmath116 in the optical @xcite .",
    "consider a patch of emission in the sky at some distance , with diffuse emission isolated to only that patch in the sky .",
    "the solid angle subtended by this emission , as viewed from an average dust particle between the observer and the source , is small . for a patch of emission with an angular diameter of a few degrees , at a distance of a few kiloparsecs ,",
    "almost all of the dust along the line of sight absorbs and scatters the emission as if it were coming from a point source . as a result ,",
    "the relationship between @xmath29  and @xmath53/ @xmath54  in equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) is accurate for measurements toward regions in which the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  emission region is limited to a small region of the sky , with the intervening dust distributed along a large heliocentric distance , as is the case with the high velocity emission toward the scutum cloud .",
    "this accuracy diminishes with decreasing distance between the observer and the source , such as for the very extended emission from the local neighborhood near @xmath34  = 0   kms@xmath22 .",
    "there is an additional complication that must be considered in the relation between @xmath53/ @xmath54  and @xmath29 . in equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) , @xmath53and @xmath54  represent the total emission from a source , obtained by integrating the total number of h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  photons emitted from a single interstellar cloud at some distance , from which an @xmath29  to the cloud may be measured . however , our observations are of emission along an extended line of sight with sources at different velocities ( distances ) .",
    "each line of sight intersects multiple parcels of warm ionized gas , such as spiral arms , and each parcel has a fwhm @xmath117 .",
    "isolating which photons are coming from which ` cloud ' becomes formidable if the clouds are not sufficiently separated in velocity .",
    "therefore care must be taken in interpreting the value of @xmath29  at any one velocity point , especially at a velocity between well - defined peaks in the emission line profile or for profiles in which no strong peaks can be identified . in this case , the _ average _ value of @xmath29  over a velocity interval corresponding to the expected width of the line is more representative of the actual value of @xmath29 .",
    "we can verify the relationship between @xmath53/ @xmath54  and extinction by comparing our estimates of @xmath12  with direct measurements from stellar spectrophotometry in the same region of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite used a wide - field , balloon - borne uv imager to study a 6@xmath27  region centered on the scutum cloud . using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic distances",
    ", they mapped out the changes in @xmath12  with distance toward stars they detected in the uv .",
    "they identified a low extinction window within their 6@xmath27  field , which is coincident with the directions in which we see high - velocity h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  emission .",
    "the average of nine wham h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  spectra that lie in this window , as defined by @xcite , is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the shaded regions around the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  spectrum in figure  [ fig:5 ] represent the maximum extent of the uncertainty in the data , combining random and systematic uncertainties .",
    "since the uncertainty in the h@xmath0  data comes primarily from systematic uncertainty in the calibration , the uncertainty in one spectrum is correlated with the uncertainty in another .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty in the average h@xmath0  spectrum shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] was estimated by taking the difference between the average of the upper limits and the average of the lower limits of all of the spectra .",
    "the uncertainty in the h@xmath1  spectra , on the other hand , comes primarily from the uncertainty in the location of the continuum . assuming that the uncertainty in the location of this baseline is uncorrelated from one direction to another , we estimated the overall uncertainty in the average spectrum to be the average uncertainty of the continuum placement divided by the square root of the number of spectra ( 9 ) used to construct the h@xmath1  spectrum in figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "this same method is used for of the all of figures in the paper in which average h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  spectra appear .",
    "it is important to note that the shaded regions do not represent poisson errors , but rather the maximum allowable values of the data , given the random and systematic uncertainties .",

    "the shaded region around the dark line is the uncertainty in our inferred value of @xmath12 , calculated by combining the upper and lower limits of the average h@xmath0  and h@xmath1   spectrum . only those radial velocities with reasonably low values of the uncertainty are shown , which excludes @xmath34  @xmath118  and @xmath34  @xmath119 .",
    "the asterisks are from the data for the uv bright stars from @xcite , and have been placed on this diagram using a distance - velocity conversion from the galactic rotation curve of @xcite with @xmath120 kpc .",
    "this rotation curve is used throughout the paper .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the location of the tangent point velocity .",
    "photometric error bars and distance uncertainties for the stellar data are not provided in @xcite , but they are likely to be large for the faint , distant stars at @xmath121kpc , corresponding to a @xmath34  @xmath122 .",
    "we note that the scatter in the stellar @xmath12  data is larger than the uncertainty in the velocity - distance relation that may be caused by deviations from non - circular rotation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the scatter is likely related to either the patchiness of the extinction within this region or observational uncertainties .",
    "we find that our estimates of @xmath12  match those observed by @xcite , within this scatter .",
    "the assumptions that enter into the conversion between @xmath53/ @xmath54  and extinction appear valid , and we can therefore use with confidence our observations to estimate extinction toward the inner galaxy , well beyond that provided by stellar measurements ( see fig .

    "the measured values of @xmath29  at each velocity point allows us to correct our observed h@xmath0  profiles for extinction .",
    "figure  [ fig : hacor ] shows two spectra , one of which has been corrected for extinction . the ` observed ' spectrum is an average of nine spectra toward the window , and is the same h@xmath0  spectrum from figure  [ fig:5 ] .",

    "because of the ambiguity in the velocity - distance relationship in the inner galaxy , some of the emission near the tangent point could be from gas that lies beyond the tangent point . however , this gas is at a larger galactocentric distance and z - height , where the density , and contribution the corrected emission measure , is likely to be lower .",
    "the corrected spectrum maintains its multiple component features , implying enhanced emission from the sagittarius and scutum spiral arms and from the tangent point .",
    "correcting the observed h@xmath0  emission for extinction allows us to infer some intrinsic properties of the ionized gas in the inner galaxy .",
    "since the h@xmath0  emission is related to the emission measure of the gas , @xmath130 , we can extract information about the density and the vertical distribution of h@xmath9 by examining the change in the measured @xmath53  in both latitude and distance toward the window .",
    "following the formalism of @xcite , we assume that the ionized gas has a vertical distribution about the galactic plane with the form @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the density in the midplane and @xmath133 is the scale height .",

    "if we use @xmath137 to denote the line of sight filling fraction of the emitting gas , and assume that the temperature , filling fraction , and path length through an ionized region are not functions of vertical height @xmath138 , then we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq:7 ] ) as @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the extinction - corrected h@xmath0  intensity at the midplane . finally , we replace @xmath138 with @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the heliocentric distance to the emitting gas at a galactic latitude @xmath143 to obtain @xmath144 we now have a relationship between two observable quantities , @xmath53and @xmath143 , from which we may infer the root mean square ( rms ) midplane density @xmath145 and scale height @xmath133 .",
    "additionally , the low extinction window allows us to isolate emission from different distances and estimate the density and scale height as a function of galactic radius .",

    "these data are from spectra toward the low extinction window shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] that lie below the galactic plane . in order to perform a reliable extinction correction ,",

    "this averaging was required because of the finite width of the emission lines , and because some averaging is needed to produce smooth profiles at low intensities .    in order to convert the observed quantities shown in figure  [ fig:8 ] to the inferred quantities in figure  [ fig:9 ] ,",
    "the distance to the emitting gas @xmath142 and its pathlength @xmath146 must be known .",

    "these intervals encompass the location of the fitted velocity components shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] and represent emission from the sagittarius arm , scutum arm , and near the tangent point .",
    "the emission within each interval is assumed to occupy a pathlength @xmath148 kpc along the line of sight , centered at heliocentric distances @xmath142 = 3.0 , 4.5 , and 6.0 kpc , respectively .",
    "these distances are consistent with the standard spiral arm model of @xcite and the galactic rotation curve model from @xcite with @xmath149 kpc , as shown in figure  [ fig : kindist ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : kindist ] also includes the relationship between @xmath34  and @xmath142 for a flat rotation curve , and shows that the kinematic distances we adopt are not very sensitive to the particular rotation curve that is assumed . we see that the assumed path length , @xmath148 kpc , is the approximate change in kinematic distance over a @xmath81 interval for all three selected velocity intervals .",
    "we note , however , that non - circular rotation as well as random motions associated with spiral arms , expanding shells , and shear motion may be present along these lines of sight . the magnitude of these effects are generally thought to produce distance uncertainties of less than 10% , but may vary by more than this amount for any individual sight line @xcite .",
    "a definitive conversion between emission at a particular velocity and a specific distance therefore suffers from this uncertainty , and our adopted distances should be understood as estimates . from equation  ( [ eq:9 ] ) above , we note that the inferred scale height @xmath133 is directly proportional to the adopted distance @xmath142 .    in addition , it may be possible that we are detecting emission from ionized gas beyond the tangent point .",
    "this extremely distant emission would appear at lower velocities with increasing distance and , if present , would affect the @xmath150 kpc emission most , where the velocity ` turn - around ' occurs ( see figure  [ fig : kindist ] ) .",
    "since the overall emission decreases with increasing distance from the plane , the emission from beyond the tangent point , if present , would result in an overestimate of the emission at lower latitudes .",
    "however , because the emission beyond the tangent point , at a fixed latitude , is farther away from the plane , it is expected to be much fainter than the emission closer to the sun .",
    "we will assume that this effect is negligible for the @xmath151 kpc emission , and that for the @xmath152 kpc emission , the inferred midplane density may be overestimated and the scale height may be underestimated .    for each latitude in figure  [ fig:8 ] ,",

    "observations in the neighborhood of the sun of the warm ionized medium , which has a significantly lower rms density ( 0.05 @xmath11 ) and larger scale height ( 1 kpc ) than the ionized gas found here , show that it has a filling factor of @xmath166 @xcite .    if the product @xmath167 does not change considerably with distance , then the data in figure  [ fig:9 ]",

    "furthermore , the relatively small size of the window ( @xmath170 ) compared to the angular resolution of the h@xmath0  and  observations ( @xmath171 ) limits a morphological comparison of the two phases . nevertheless , some general spectral correlations seem to hold true in this region and provide some insight in the relationship between the  and .    from an examination of all of the h@xmath0  and  spectra in the direction of the scutum cloud",
    ", we find that in most cases , kinematically distinct emission components from  appear near the same velocity as the warm ( broad ) neutral  components , and that these velocity components correspond to the sagittarius and scutum spiral arms . however , there is little or no correlation between the _ strengths _ of the  and warm  emission .",
    "this is consistent with the likely ionization mechanism of hydrogen .",
    "if the  is photoionized , then as long as the  is opaque to lyman continuum photons ( @xmath172  @xmath59 ) , the emission measure from h@xmath0  is related only to the intensity of the ionizing flux and is thus unrelated to the total column density of .",
    "interestingly , there are some directions in which very little high velocity  emission is present , yet there is substantial h@xmath0emission .",
    "an example of this is seen in the inner galaxy near @xmath173 in the three rightmost panels of figure  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "this comparison would look even more dramatic if the 21 cm spectrum were compared to extinction corrected h@xmath0  profiles , as shown in figure  [ fig : hacor ] .",
    "these observations suggest that the ism is substantially ionized in these regions , with the  perhaps confined to small , unresolved  clouds that populate the inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "we can compare the column densities of the ionized and neutral gas .",
    "the midplane rms space density of electrons at different distances , over 1 kpc intervals , is estimated in  [ sec : scale ] and shown in figure  [ fig:9 ] . multiplying these space densities by 1 kpc yields midplane column densities @xmath174 at heliocentric distances @xmath175kpc , respectively . integrating the average  spectra at @xmath176 between @xmath177 from @xcite over the same velocity / distance intervals , yields midplane column densities @xmath178 .",
    "we note that column densities of @xmath179 are upper limits , because its volume filling fraction @xmath137 is less than 1 .",
    "in addition , the column densities of  may be lower limits , because of potential  self - absorption features in  spectra near the galactic plane ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , the fraction of gas that is ionized , @xmath180 , at each of these locations in the inner galaxy are upper limits . if @xmath137 and 21 cm absorption effects are the same at all distances , then the relative amount of  increases toward the galactic center , with values of @xmath181 at @xmath182kpc , respectively .",
    "the extinction - corrected values of @xmath53  are a direct measure of the flux of lyman continuum photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an  cloud illuminated on one side by a flux @xmath183 of ionizing photons emits one h@xmath0  photon for every 2.05 lyman continuum photons absorbed , provided the gas is optically thick to the lyman continuum photons and optically thin at h@xmath0  @xcite . for a cloud embedded in a uniform field of lyman continuum radiation , the intensity of h@xmath0",
    "is increased by a factor of 2 , because there are two illuminated surfaces in projection .",
    "therefore @xmath53  toward a collection of @xmath184 clouds bathed in a lyman continuum flux @xmath183 is given by @xmath185 with @xmath53  measured in rayleighs . from the fits shown in figure",
    "[ fig:8 ] , our observations indicate that the extinction corrected midplane h@xmath0  intensity is @xmath186 at heliocentric distances @xmath175kpc , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to a one - sided lyman continuum flux of @xmath187  and @xmath188  photons @xmath59 s@xmath22 . if there is the same number of clouds present in each 1 kpc interval over which @xmath53  was measured , then the flux of ionizing radiation increases by a factor of 4 from @xmath162kpc to @xmath163kpc .",
    "thus both the lyman continuum flux and the fractional amount of h@xmath9 appear to increase toward the inner galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with many observations that suggest an increase in star formation activity in the galaxy interior to the solar circle .",
    "in addition to the h@xmath0  and  spectra , a relationship appears to exists between features in the molecular co emission spectra and values of @xmath29  derived from the optical h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  emission .",
    "samples of these data are shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : ext ] , @xmath29  remains flat or increases with velocity ( distance ) in all directions , consistent with the cumulative effects of extinction with distance . in some cases ,",
    "a sharp rise in @xmath29  is evident , indicative of the presence of a dense concentration of dust .",
    "the leftmost panel in figure  [ fig:7 ] , near @xmath189 , shows an example of this .",
    "not suprisingly , we find strong co emission at the same velocities as this sharp rise in @xmath29 , confirming the well - known correlation between the presence of molecular gas and interstellar dust . in other cases , such as in the second panel from the left in figure  [ fig:7 ] ,",
    "@xmath29  rises smoothly in the absence of strong co emission , suggesting that interstellar dust is more smoothly distributed along the line of sight .",
    "these independent measurements of the extinction , when combined with  and co spectra , allow us to quantify the relationship between the dust and gas content toward the window .",

    "their observations traversed sightlines with @xmath192 , from which they determined a  definitive value \" of @xmath13/@xmath12@xmath193atoms @xmath59 mag@xmath194 .",
    "this quantity is cited often and is used to estimate color excesses ( and extinction corrections ) for objects in which @xmath12  can not be determined directly .",
    "the lines of sight to the low extinction window contain substantially more dust and gas than those studied in @xcite .",
    "however , the same kind of analysis can be made , and it can be compared with their canonical value . any cumulative change in this value over a very long distance can also be assessed .",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] summarizes this analysis .",
    "the top panel shows the average h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  spectra toward five lines of sight toward the scutum cloud . as with the previous figures , the total uncertainty in the spectra",
    "are shown as the shaded regions around the spectra , and the h@xmath1  spectra have been multiplied by 3.94 , the ratio of @xmath53/ @xmath54  in the absence of extinction .",
    "these five directions were chosen because of their low uncertainty in @xmath29 , presence of high - velocity emission , and low co emission line strength .",
    "this increased the accuracy of our determination of @xmath13/@xmath12 , and avoided directions where co self - absorption may be present @xcite .",
    "the second and third panels show the average  and co spectra within the wham beam in these directions , from the surveys of @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the straight line at high velocities in the co spectra indicate a lack of data at those velocities .",
    "the fourth panel shows the cumulative column density of , along with  +  2h@xmath195 , as a function of distance in units of @xmath196 @xmath59 .",
    "this is calculated by integrating the  and co spectra from @xmath197 out to each velocity point , using a co - to - h@xmath195 mass conversion factor of @xmath198  from @xcite .",
    "we note that while the co spectra appear quite noisy , there exists a positive signal which significantly contributes to the total neutral hydrogen column density at the higher velocities .",
    "the fifth panel shows the inferred values of the color excess @xmath12along with its uncertainty .",
    "the values of @xmath12  are only shown over the velocity interval in which the uncertainties are low .",
    "the bottom panel shows the ratio of @xmath12/@xmath13 , in units of mag per 10@xmath199 @xmath59 , along with a solid horizontal line at the location of the canonical value from @xcite .",
    "note that this is the inverse of the quantity @xmath13/@xmath12  discussed in @xcite .",
    "out to @xmath77 , our derived value agrees with the value from @xcite . beyond this velocity ,",
    "there is an increase in the amount of extinction per unit hydrogen column density , by about a factor of two .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig:10 ] , this is the result of an increase in @xmath12 .",
    "we note that the potential presence of very faint , broad h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  emission in the spectra would have been removed by our continuum subtraction process , particularly at the highest velocities .",
    "this effect would result in an underestimate of the h@xmath0  emission relative to h@xmath1 , and would increase the derived value of @xmath12/@xmath13  over its already enhanced value .",
    "in addition , since we are measuring the _ cumulative _ extinction and column density , this increase suggests that the local value of this number in the inner galaxy , at @xmath200kpc , is even higher than the observed value of @xmath10 0.3 mag per 10@xmath199 @xmath59 .",
    "if a constant , elevated value is present only over the last third of the distance out to the tangent point , as the figure suggests , than the local value near the tangent point is @xmath10 0.6 mag per 10@xmath199 @xmath59 , more than 3 times greater than the value near the sun .",
    "recent work by @xcite have found the opposite trend toward regions with very low reddening . using high sensitivity  observations at high galactic latitude , they find that @xmath12/@xmath13  @xmath10 0.1 mag per 10@xmath199 @xmath59 , which is almost half of the canonical value .",
    "their data included sightlines with  column densities that are @xmath201 times below those included in @xcite . when combined with our results",
    ", it appears that the amount of reddening per unit hydrogen atom in the galaxy is not a constant .",
    "another parameter , perhaps related to the total @xmath13  and/or galactic environment , may be important in understanding the relationship between @xmath12  and @xmath13 .",
    "we note that although our derived values within 4 kpc of the sun fall near the canonical value , there are several uncertainties in this analysis .",
    "most importantly , @xcite were able to directly measure both @xmath12  through stellar photometry as well as @xmath13  through uv absorption lines , whereas we have used @xmath53/ @xmath54  as a proxy for the extinction , and the emission lines from  and co to estimate the total neutral hydrogen column . to address some of the caveats regarding our estimates of the extinction , particularly with the potential blending of the emission components ,",
    "we have modeled the average h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  spectra as a sum of multiple gaussian components , and compared the ratio of these individual components to the smooth curve of @xmath12 .",
    "each of the five h@xmath0  spectra were fitted with five components , with fixed widths of @xmath81 .",
    "the h@xmath1  spectra were fitted by fixing both the width and location of the components , as determined from the fit to the corresponding h@xmath0  spectra , since this emission comes from the same atoms .",
    "the ratio of each of these components was converted into @xmath12 , and these are shown as dark circles in the fifth panel of figure  [ fig:10 ] .",
    "this method yields ratios that are consistent with the smooth , average curve , showing that the blending of the emission lines is not an important effect .",
    "in addition , the relationship between @xmath53/ @xmath54  and @xmath12  is not very sensitive to potential changes in @xmath109 along these lines of sight toward the inner galaxy , as discussed in  [ sec : ext ] .",
    "our calculation of @xmath13  is also subject to some uncertainty .",
    "the intensity of co spectra are near the level of the quoted uncertainty in the co survey . however , when integrated over all velocities , the integration yields a result several standard deviations away from the noise .",
    "the uncertainty in the cumulative co emission is smallest at the highest velocities .",
    "the subsequent conversion from this value to an h@xmath195 column density is not very well constrained . the conversion factor , @xmath202 ,",
    "is known to vary in different environments , particularly in regions with non - solar metallicities , as is the case in the inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "the higher metallicity in the inner galaxy would result in a conversion that overestimates the actual @xmath203 at the higher velocities , which in turn would further increase our derived value of @xmath12/@xmath13  over its already enhanced value .",
    "however , by selecting directions with low co emission line strengths , we may have introduced a bias in our results which may not hold true for other sightlines in the inner galaxy .",
    "if the dust properties in the _ ionized _ gas are similar to those in the neutral medium , then the increasing fraction of h@xmath9 toward the inner galaxy (  6 ) would correspondingly increase @xmath12/@xmath13 . however , the 40% increase derived for @xmath204is far too small to account for a factor of three increase in @xmath12/@xmath13 .",
    "the uncertainty in the beam filling factor of  and co emission within the 1@xmath27  wham beam also may bias our results .",
    "these measurements were taken with a single dish telescope , and therefore clumping of the emission into small knots can change the interpretation of the data .",
    "for example , consider a ` two - phase ' medium , in which the column density of dust and neutral gas are bimodally distributed between two values in the beam .",
    "for a fixed average column density , this clumpiness results in differentially more light passing through the lower extinction regions , reducing the effective optical depth .",
    "our analysis of @xmath12/@xmath13  has assumed that the radio emission is smoothly distributed over some path length within the beam .",
    "if this is not true , then our derived values of @xmath12/@xmath13  should be considered lower limits , with this ratio elevated toward higher - density ` clumps ' within a 1@xmath27  beam .",
    "the observed variation in the total column density of co and  among the five beams vary by a factor less than 2 .",
    "if a density contrast of a factor of 2 between two ` phases ' is present within a beam , then for an average total column density of @xmath205 @xmath59 , the effective @xmath12/@xmath13  is reduced by 10% at most , for all values of the relative areal filling factor of the two phases . a reduction by 50%",
    "is not reached until the density contrast reaches 10 , and then only for a limited range in areal filling factors .",
    "we conclude that our values of @xmath12/@xmath13  are not strongly affected by such systematic uncertainties .",
    "observations of the emission lines of [ ] , [ ] , and [ ]  can be used to explore the physical conditions of gas by comparing the strength of these lines to that of h@xmath0 .",
    "for example , [ ] /h@xmath0  traces variations in the electron temperature of warm ionized gas , assuming that the gas is photoionized and that that ionization fraction of n@xmath9/n is not changing @xcite .",
    "the line ratio of [ ] / [ ]  is nearly temperature independent and can be used to estimate the ionization fraction of s@xmath9/s , while the ratio [ ] /h@xmath0  is a measure of the higher ionization states of the gas .",
    "these lines have been used to characterize diffuse warm ionized gas within @xmath10 2 kpc of the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observations of these lines toward the low extinction window provide a new and unique opportunity to examine the potential changes in the physical conditions of the gas toward the inner galaxy .",
    "results from some of our observations of these lines are shown in figure  [ fig:11 ] .",
    "spectra taken at the same latitude within the window have been averaged over longitude and appear in each of the panels in the figure .",

    "there are several interesting trends in the data . while the h@xmath0emission becomes weaker at higher @xmath206 , both [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0increase . at a given latitude , [ ] / [ ]",
    "tends to decrease with increasing distance ( velocity ) .",
    "this effect is greatest for the @xmath207 data .",
    "there are significant changes in [ ] /h@xmath1  with both latitude and distance . at @xmath208 , there are two velocity components in the [ ]  spectrum that correspond to components in the h@xmath1  spectrum , with [ ] /h@xmath1  @xmath209  0.05 for both components . with increasing distances from the plane , [ ] /h@xmath1  associated with gas in the inner galaxy ( near the tangent point ) increase by a factor of four or more , from 0.05 at @xmath208 ( @xmath210 pc ) to about 0.2 at @xmath207 ( @xmath211 pc ) .",

    "the interpretation of [ ] / [ ]  also suffers from an uncertainty in the assumptions about the physical state of the gas .",
    "however , if variations in [ ] / [ ]  are due only to changes in the ionization fraction of s@xmath9/s ( i.e. , n@xmath9/n is constant ) , then the data suggest that s@xmath9/s increases from @xmath209  0.25 to @xmath209 0.4 with increasing @xmath206 for the nearby gas , and is relatively constant at @xmath209  0.25 in the inner galaxy , assuming s / h = 1.86@xmath215 @xcite .",
    "the [ ]  data for the inner galaxy show a definitive increase in [ ] /h@xmath0  with increasing distance from the plane .",
