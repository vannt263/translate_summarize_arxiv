    "a moving particle approaching a metal surface losses part of its energy as a consequence of the creation of electron - hole pairs and both bulk and surface collective excitations , i.e. , plasmons @xcite .",
    "a theoretical description of these electronic excitations is basic to understand the processes involved in several spectroscopies , such as x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) , auger - electron spectroscopy ( aes ) , and reflection - electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( reels)@xcite . equally , the interaction of moving ions with solids has represented an active field of basic and applied physics @xcite .    in this paper , we follow the theoretical framework developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and focus on the interaction of charged particles moving with constant velocity along a definite trajectory that is perpendicular to a jellium surface .",
    "previous linear - response calculations of the energy loss of charged particles entering a metal surface were carried out with the use of simplified models @xcite . here",
    "we present self - consistent calculations of the energy - loss spectra , as obtained in the framework of time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite .",
    "although in the case of charged particles moving inside a solid nonlinear effects may be crucial in the interpretation of energy - loss measurements @xcite , surface effects are expected to be well described within linear - response theory , unless the velocity of the probe particle is small compared to the fermi velocity of the solid @xcite .",
    "contributions to the energy loss coming from the excitation of bulk and surface plasmons are studied in detail , as well as the influence of an appropriate characterization of the electron density at the surface .",
    "the latter is found to be essential when the particle penetrates the solid , as the surface region is particularly perturbed when the particle crosses the surface . besides , interference effects occurring between the various parts of the ion trajectory are more relevant than in the case of charged particles moving at a fixed distance from the surface , which claims for the need of a self - consistent treatment of the surface electronic response .    in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly discuss general expressions for the energy - loss spectra of charged particles entering a solid surface along a trajectory that is perpendicular to the surface . in section 3 ,",
    "we report the results of our full self - consistent calculations , and the effect that the electronic selvage at a metal surface has on the energy - loss spectra is discussed by comparing our full calculations with those obtained for electron densities that drop abruptly to zero at the surface .",
    "unless otherwise is stated , atomic units are used throughout , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "let us consider a recoiless particle of charge @xmath5 moving with non - relativistic velocity @xmath6 along a definite trajectory that is perpendicular to a metal surface ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the moving particle will be characterized by a classical charge distribution",
    ". the solid will be described by a bounded free - electron gas normal to the @xmath7 axis , consisting of a fixed uniform positive background plus a neutralizing cloud of interacting electrons of density @xmath8 .    within linear - response theory ,",
    "the probability per unit time and unit energy for the probe particle at @xmath7 to transfer energy @xmath9 to the solid is found to be @xcite @xmath10\\int dq\\,q\\,{\\rm im}w(z , z';q,\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 represents a wave vector parallel to the surface and @xmath12 is the so - called screened interaction @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 being two - dimensional fourier transforms of the bare coulomb potential and the density - response function of the solid @xcite , respectively .",
    "the energy that the probe particle at @xmath7 looses per unit path length due to the creation of electronic excitations in the solid is simply @xcite @xmath16    in the framework of tddft , the interacting density - response function @xmath15 is fully determined from the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the kohn - sham equation of density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and the exchange - correlation ( xc ) kernel @xmath17 accounting for short - range xc effects ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) is taken to be zero . to compute @xmath15",
    ", we first take a jellium slab of thickness @xmath18 @xcite and electron density equal to the average electron density of valence electrons in al ( @xmath19 ) , and then solve the kohn - sham equation of dft in the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , by following the procedure described in ref .",
    "for comparison , we also consider simplified models for the screened interaction @xmath12 of a semi - infinite electron gas , which are derived for electron densities that drop abruptly to zero at the surface : these are a hydrodynamic model ( hdm ) @xcite , and a specular - reflexion model ( srm ) @xcite which expresses the screened interaction in terms of the bulk dielectric function @xmath20 .",
    "first of all , we show results for the probablity @xmath21 as a function of @xmath7 and for selected values of the energy @xmath9 , which we obtain either in the full self - consistent surface rpa , in the hdm , or in the srm with the bulk rpa dielectric function .",
    "we set the velocity @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the bohr velocity ) and @xmath24 , and our results can then be used for arbitrary values of @xmath5 , as the energy - loss probability is within linear - response theory proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "2 shows the probability @xmath21 for the moving particle to transfer either the energy @xmath26 [ @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the average electron density , i.e. , @xmath29 , corresponding to the excitation of a bulk plasmon , or @xmath30 [ @xmath31 , corresponding to the excitation of a surface plasmon .",
    "when @xmath26 [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , the energy - loss probability increases as the projectile enters the surface and reaches a constant value deep inside the solid . at the surface - plasmon energy [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] , the probability reaches a maximum when the probe particle is located near the surface , and diminishes in the interior of the solid where only electron - hole pairs can be excited with @xmath30 .",
    "it is well known that within a classical model consisting of a semi - infinite medium of local dielectric function @xmath32 the energy - loss probability @xmath33 would be maximum at @xmath34 .",
    "however , the actual dispersion of the surface plasmon , not included in the classical model , shifts the peak position of @xmath33 towards the interior of the solid .",
    "moreover , the so - called bregenzung or boundary effect reduces the coupling to bulk plasmons by the presence of surface plasmons .",
    "as the electronic selvage is changed from zero ( hd and srm ) to its actual structure ( rpa ) , the creation of electron - hole pairs increases and the bregenzung effect is more pronounced , thereby yielding larger surface - plasmon and smaller bulk - plasmon excitation probabilities .",
    "3 exhibits our full surface rpa ( solid line ) , hdm ( dashed line ) , and srm ( dashed - dotted line ) calculations of the stopping power , as obtained from eq .",
    "( 3 ) as a function of @xmath7 and with @xmath22 .",
    "as the projectile is entering the surface , our full surface rpa energy - loss calculations show a broader and smoother structure , which is mainly due to the presence of a non - abrupt electron - density profile at the surface . before entering the surface ,",
    "the selvage electronic structure yields a larger energy loss than predicted within srm . inside the solid",
    "the actual energy loss is smaller than in the srm , due to the bregenzung effect arising from the orthogonality of the surface and bulk plasmon modes . in the interior of the solid ,",
    "where the electron density is constant , both our full surface rpa and srm calculations coincide with the well - known rpa stopping power of a uniform electron gas ( horizontal dotted line ) . on the other hand , the hd calculation deep inside the solid coincides with the bulk hd , which differs from the bulk rpa .    in conclusion ,",
    "our full self - consistent rpa calculations of the energy loss of charged particles entering a metal surface indicate that a fully quantum - mechanical treatment of the electronic response of a metal surface is necessary to quantitatively describe the effect of the presence of the surface . a systematic self - consistent investigation of both rpa and beyond - rpa energy - loss spectra of charged particles moving along arbitrary trajectories is now in progress .",
