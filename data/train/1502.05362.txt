    "we have recently completed two major spectroscopic surveys of da stars using the spectroscopic approach where hydrogen balmer lines are fitted with the predictions of detailed model atmospheres .",
    "@xcite conducted a spectroscopic survey of over 1300 bright ( @xmath0 17.5 ) , hydrogen - rich white dwarfs based largely on the last published version of the mccook & sion catalog @xcite .",
    "the gianninas et al .",
    "sample included 56 known zz ceti stars , 145 photometrically constant da stars as well as several white dwarfs whose atmospheric parameters placed them within or near the empirical boundaries of the zz ceti instability strip ( see figure 35 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this includes the ultra - massive zz ceti star , gd  518 ( wd  1659 + 662 ) , discovered by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed an exhaustive spectroscopic survey of the superblink proper motion database ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) aimed at obtaining a complete sample of white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood within 40 pc of the sun .",
    "several zz ceti white dwarf candidates were also identified in this survey .",
    "the optical spectra for our zz ceti candidates have been secured using the steward observatory 2.3  m telescope equipped with the boller & chivens spectrograph .",
    "this provides wavelength coverage from @xmath1  @xmath2  38005200    with a resolution of 6    fwhm .    in table 1",
    ", we present the effective temperature , @xmath3 , and surface gravity , @xmath4 , for each star .",
    "these parameters were measured using the standard spectroscopic technique developed by @xcite , with recent improvements presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these fits were performed using our most recent grid of model atmospheres , based on the ml2/@xmath5  =  0.7 version of the mixing - length theory .",
