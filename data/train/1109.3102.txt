    "we consider in this work high data rate transmission in the ultra wideband ( uwb ) regime . to prevent disturbance of existing systems , e.g. gps and umts ,",
    "the federal communications commission ( fcc ) released @xcite a very low power spectral density ( psd ) mask for ultra - wideband ( uwb ) systems . to ensure that sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is maintained in the frequency band @xmath1$]ghz , as required by the fcc",
    ", the pulses have to be designed for a high efficient frequency utilisation .",
    "this utilisation can be expressed by the pulses normalized effective signal power ( nesp ) @xcite .",
    "several pulse shaping methods for pulse amplitude and pulse position modulation ( pam and ppm ) were developed in the last decade based on a fir prefiltering of a fixed basic pulse . due to the high sampling rates in uwb",
    "this fir filtering is realized by a tapped delay line @xcite .",
    "a snr optimization under the fcc mask constraints then reduces to a fir filter optimization @xcite .",
    "since the snr is limited , the amount of signals can be increased to achieve higher data rates or to enable multi - user capabilities . for coherent and synchronized transmission over memoryless awgn channels , an increased number @xmath0 of mutually orthogonal uwb signals inside the same time slot , known as @xmath0-ary orthogonal signal design ,",
    "improves the ber performance over @xmath2 and hence the achievable [ rev1rem1]rate of the system ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.4 ) . combining spectral shaping and orthogonalization is an inherently difficult problem being neither linear nor convex .",
    "therefore most methods approach this problem * sequentially * , e.g. combining spectral optimization with a gram - schmidt construction @xcite .",
    "this usually results in an unacceptable loss in the nesp value of the pulses @xcite .",
    "moreover these orthogonal pulses are different in shape and therefore not useful for ppm .",
    "furthermore , a big challenge in uwb impulse radio ( uwb - ir ) implementation are high rate sampling operations .",
    "therefore , an analog transmission scheme is desirable @xcite to avoid high sampling rates in ad / da conversion @xcite .",
    "usually , ppm is referred to an orthogonal ( non - overlapping ) pulse modulation scheme . to achieve higher data rates in ppm , pulse overlapping was already investigated in optical communication @xcite and called oppm .",
    "an application to uwb was studied for the binary case with a gaussian monocycle @xcite .",
    "to the authors knowledge , no orthogonal overlapping ppm ( ooppm ) signaling has been considered based on strictly time - limited pulses . in this work",
    "we propose a new analog pulse shape design for uwb - ir to enable an almost ooppm signaling which approximate the ooppm scheme up to a desired accuracy .    in our approach , we first design a time - limited spectral optimized pulse @xmath3 and perform afterwards a lwdin orthogonalization of the set of @xmath4 integer translates @xmath5 , which span the function space @xmath6 .",
    "this orthogonalization method provides an implementable and stable approximation @xmath7 to a normalized _ square - root nyquist pulse _ @xmath8 ( all integer translates are mutually orthonormal ) . using the _ fourier transformation _ for @xmath3 given by @xmath9[eq : fouriertransform ] for every @xmath10 , the square - root nyquist pulse @xmath8 can be expressed in the frequency - domain @xmath11 for @xmath12 almost everywhere , which is known as the _ orthogonalization trick _ @xcite . usually in digital signal processing , see fig .",
    "[ fig : appscheme ] , the time - continuous signals ( pulses ) in @xmath13 are sampled by an analog to digital ( ad ) operation ( either in time or frequency ) to obtain time - discrete signals in @xmath14 .",
    "then a discretization of the orthogonalization in yields a finite digital transformation @xmath15 to construct a discrete signal in the frequency domain which has again to be transformed by a da operation to obtain finally an approximation of the square - root nyquist pulse @xcite . + instead of using such an ad / da conversion to operate in a discrete domain ( depictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : appscheme ] by the digital box ) , we use the * democratic * [ rev1remii ] lwdin orthogonalization @xmath16 ( in the analog box ) , found by per - olov lwdin in @xcite , where all @xmath17 linear independent pulse translates are involved simultaneously by a linear combination to generate a set of time - limited mutual orthonormal pulses .",
    "hence the lwdin orthogonalization is order independent .",
    "the lwdin pulses constitute then an orthonormal basis for the span @xmath6 of the initial basis @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , as we will show in our main theorem  [ th : lozak ] , the lwdin orthogonalization @xmath16 is a stable approximation method to the construction in and operates completely in the analog domain .",
    "note , that a discretization of generates neither shift - orthonormal pulses nor a set of mutual orthonormal pulses .",
    "the important property of the lwdin method is its minimal summed energy distortion to the initial basis .",
    "it turns out that all orthonormal pulses maintain the spectral efficiency  quite well  .",
    "as @xmath19 tends to infinity the lwdin orthogonalization @xmath20 applied to the initial pulse @xmath3 delivers the square - root nyquist pulse @xmath8 , which allows a real - time ooppm system with only one single matched filter at the receiver . since the lwdin transform @xmath16 is hard to compute and to control we introduce an approximate lwdin orthogonalization ( alo ) @xmath21 and investigate its stability and convergence properties .",
    "it turns out that for fixed @xmath19 the transformations @xmath16 and @xmath21 are both implementable by a fir filter bank ( realised as a tapped delay line ) like the spectral optimization in @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath22 and @xmath23 _ approximate square - root nyquist _ pulses , since we observed that even for finite @xmath19 our analog approximation yields time  limited pulses with almost shift  orthogonal character since the sample values of the autocorrelation are below a measurable magnitude for the correlator .",
    "hence such a construction of approximate square - root nyquist pulses seems to be promising for an ooppm system .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : signalmodel ] we introduce the signal model and motivate our spectrally efficient @xmath0-ary orthogonal overlapping ppm design for uwb systems .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] we study certain properties of our filter design and investigate the combination of both approaches .",
    "furthermore , in section  [ sec : tfandonb ] we develop a connection between our result and the canonical tight frame construction .",
    "finally in section  [ sec : app ] , we demonstrate that the alo and lwdin transforms yields for sufficiently large filter orders compactly supported approximate square - root nyquist pulses , which can be used for ooppm having high spectral efficiency in the fcc region .",
    "moreover , the lwdin pulses provides also a spectrally efficient @xmath24-ary orthogonal pulse shape modulation ( psm ) @xcite .",
