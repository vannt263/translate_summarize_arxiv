    "in contrast , remark  [ r : whenvanish ] also shows that nonvanishing local cohomology of @xmath1 is not typically concentrated in a single cohomological degree .",
    "hence , the spectral sequence does not degenerate and one can not expect as simple a relationship between regularity and syzygies in the general situation . despite this , the syzygies of @xmath16 do provide a method for approximating the regularity of @xmath16 which captures the description in the special case .",
