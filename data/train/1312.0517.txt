    "the electromagnetic corrections are indeed below the @xmath217 level as assumed in the analysis of the compass data in ref.@xcite . however , with the results of the present work the radiative corrections ( as well as the leading isospin - breaking effect ) can be consistently taken into account in the analysis of a future high statistics experiment .",
    "in this appendix we study the virtual radiative corrections to elastic @xmath218 scattering . since @xmath219 is the strong interaction process underlying the charged pion - pair production @xmath220 , it is most instructive to investigate separately the radiative corrections for this simpler subprocess .",

    "based on the chiral @xmath10 contact - vertex at leading order , there are 10 associated photon - loop diagrams . for the four diagrams with external self - energy corrections the chiral tree amplitude @xmath221 in the isospin limit gets multiplied with twice the ( electromagnetic ) wave function renormalization factor of the charged pion : @xmath222 the two ( equal ) diagrams with a photon - loop in the @xmath223-channel ( either in the initial or the final state ) give together rise to a contribution to the @xmath8 scattering amplitude ,",
    "whose real part reads : @xmath224 here , we have used the ( concise ) spectral function representation of the scalar loop integral involving one photon and two pion propagators . in the same way one finds from the two photon - loop diagrams in the @xmath225-channel : @xmath226 { 1 \\over   \\sqrt{t^2 - 4 t } } \\ln { \\sqrt{4-t}+\\sqrt{-t } \\over 2 } \\nonumber",

    "the detailed comparison shows also that the term proportional to the low - energy constant @xmath2 in eq.(37 ) needs to be split up into two pieces and one part has been used in ref.@xcite to express the chiral tree amplitude @xmath239/f_\\pi^2 $ ] in terms of the physical neutral pion mass .    of particular interest",
    "is the threshold behavior of the last loop - function appearing in eq.(34 ) . by expanding this principal - value integral around @xmath240 for @xmath232",
    "one finds : @xmath241 where the first term corresponds to the well - known coulomb singularity proportional to the inverse pion velocity @xmath242 in the center - of - mass frame or the inverse relative velocity @xmath243 . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics the same electromagnetic initial- or final - state interaction effect",

    "the behavior close to threshold is governed by the coulomb singularity @xmath247 , which is shown separately by the dashed line in fig.16 .",

    "one is instructed that the result of the complete calculation in relativistic quantum field theory lies in between these two approximations .",
    "interestingly , the pure coulomb singularity @xmath247 provides the better approximation .",
    "although the sign and @xmath182-dependence are different , the magnitude of these virtual radiative corrections is comparable to the ones shown by the full line in fig.7 .",
