    "the goal of high energy physics is to identify the elementary constituents of matter and to understand their fundamental interactions . over the last twenty years",
    ", this endeavor has been extraordinarily successful .",
    "a gauge theory called the minimal standard model provides a satisfactory description of the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions of all the known elementary particles .",
    "there are very few discrepancies between theory and experiment , and most of them are at the level of a few standard deviations or less",
    ". however there is one process for which experimental results have differed from theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude : the production of charmonium at large transverse momentum at the tevatron .",
    "this dramatic conflict between experiment and theory presents a unique opportunity to make a significant step forward in our understanding of heavy quarkonium physics .    prior to 1993",
    ", the conventional wisdom on the production of charmonium in hadron collisions was based primarily on calculations in the _ color - singlet model_. in this model , the production of a charmonium state is assumed to proceed through parton processes that produce a @xmath1 pair in a color - singlet state .",
    "it is the predictions of the color - singlet model at lowest order in @xmath2 that disagree so dramatically with the tevatron data .",
    "the data can , however , be explained by combining two recent theoretical developments in heavy quarkonium physics .",
    "the first is the realization that heavy quarkonium at large transverse momentum is produced primarily by _ fragmentation _ , the hadronization of individual high-@xmath0 partons . in the color - singlet model",
    ", fragmentation first contributes at higher order in @xmath2 and thus was not taken into account in previous calculations .",
    "the second development is the realization that _ color - octet mechanisms _ , in which the @xmath1 pair is produced at short distances in a color - octet state , sometimes dominate the production of charmonium .",
    "these mechanisms can be analyzed systematically using a new factorization formalism for heavy quarkonium production that is based on an effective field theory called _",
    "nonrelativistic qcd _",
    "( nrqcd ) .",
    "the tevatron data can be explained by including a color - octet term in the fragmentation function for the formation of charmonium in a gluon jet .",
    "evidence in support of this explanation has been accumulating , but a great deal of work , both experimental and theoretical , will be required before it can be regarded as conclusive .    the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent theoretical developments in heavy quarkonium production .",
    "a brief review of these developments has been given previously by mangano @xcite .",
    "our main focus will be on the production of quarkonium in high energy colliders , where both fragmentation and color - octet mechanisms are important .",
    "the color - singlet model is reviewed in section 2 .",
    "we summarize its predictions for charmonium production in @xmath3 colliders , which are in dramatic disagreement with tevatron data .",
    "the production of quarkonium by fragmentation is reviewed in section 3 .",
    "we describe the factorization theorems of perturbative qcd that imply that fragmentation should dominate at large transverse momentum , and we illustrate them using the electromagnetic production of the @xmath4 in @xmath5 decay .",
    "we then discuss the predictions of the color - singlet model for fragmentation functions .",
    "color - octet mechanisms for producing quarkonium are reviewed in section 4 .",
    "we first discuss the production of p - wave states , where a color - octet mechanism is required for perturbative consistency .",
    "we then describe the nrqcd factorization formalism , which implies that color - octet mechanisms must also contribute to the production of s - wave states .",
    "we also discuss its implications for fragmentation functions . in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize applications of the recent theoretical developments to the production of prompt charmonium , bottomonium , and the @xmath6 at the tevatron and at lep .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with an outlook on the work that will be required to develop a comprehensive understanding of heavy quarkonium production in high energy processes .",
    "before 1993 , most predictions for charmonium production were based on the _ color - singlet model_. in this section , we review the color - singlet model and summarize its predictions at leading order in @xmath2 for charmonium production at large transverse momentum in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "we then describe the experimental results from the tevatron that have forced a reexamination of the problem of charmonium production .",
    "it is difficult to ascribe credit for the _ color - singlet model _ , since many physicists were involved in its early development .",
    "the decays of @xmath7 mesons into charmonium states through the process @xmath8 was first treated in the color - singlet model by degrand and toussaint , by wise , and by khn , nussinov , and rckl @xcite .",
    "the hadronic production of @xmath4 through the parton process @xmath9 was calculated by chang @xcite . a thorough treatment of charmonium production in hadron collisions through @xmath10 parton processes was later presented by baier and rckl @xcite .",
    "guberina , khn , peccei , and rckl @xcite applied the color - singlet model to charmonium production from the decay @xmath11 .",
    "berger and jones @xcite calculated the rate for photoproduction of charmonium , and emphasized the kinematical restrictions on the applicability of the color - singlet model .",
    "this model was also applied to the inclusive production of charmonium in @xmath12 annihilation by keung and by khn and schneider @xcite . a thorough review of the applications of the color - singlet model to heavy quarkonium production",
    "was recently given by schuler @xcite .",
    "an alternative model for quarkonium production called the _ color - evaporation model _ was developed around the same time @xcite . in this model",
    ", it was assumed that all @xmath1 pairs with invariant mass between @xmath13 and the @xmath14 threshold @xmath15 produce charmonium states .",
    "the fraction @xmath16 of the @xmath1 pairs that form a particular charmonium state @xmath17 is assumed to be independent of the production process .",
    "this model is incapable of describing the variation of the production ratios for charmonium states between processes and as functions of kinematical variables .",
    "it will therefore not be considered further .    to motivate the color - singlet model",
    ", we can think of the production of charmonium as proceeding in two steps .",
    "the first step is the production of a @xmath1 pair , and the second step is the binding of the @xmath18 pair into a charmonium state . in order to have a significant probability of binding",
    ", the @xmath1 pair must be produced with relative momentum that , in the @xmath1 rest frame , is small compared to the mass @xmath19 of the charm quark . otherwise , the @xmath20 and @xmath21 will fly apart and ultimately form @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons .",
    "we first consider the production of the @xmath1 pair .",
    "assuming that the @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not present in the initial state , any feynman diagram for the production of a @xmath1 pair must involve virtual particles that are off their mass shells by amounts of order @xmath19 or larger . the part of the amplitude in which all internal lines are off - shell by amounts of order @xmath19 or larger is called the _ short - distance _ part , and it is calculable using perturbation theory in @xmath24 .",
    "the parts of the amplitude in which the @xmath20 and @xmath21 lines are off - shell by amounts much less than @xmath19 can be considered part of the amplitude for the formation of the bound state .",
    "the short - distance part of the amplitude describes the production of a @xmath1 pair with a spatial separation that is of order @xmath25 or smaller .",
    "this follows from the fact that the short - distance part is insensitive to changes in the relative 3-momentum of the @xmath20 and @xmath26 that are much less than @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath25 is much smaller than the length scale associated with the charmonium wavefunction , the @xmath1 pair is essentially pointlike on that scale .",
    "thus we need only consider the amplitude for a pointlike @xmath1 pair to bind to form a charmonium state . this amplitude will necessarily depend on the charmonium state @xmath17 and on the quantum numbers of the @xmath1 pair .",
    "for any given charmonium state , the dominant fock state consists of a color - singlet @xmath1 pair in a definite angular - momentum state . we denote the two possible color states of a @xmath1 pair by @xmath27 for color - singlet and @xmath28 for color - octet .",
    "we use the spectroscopic notation @xmath29 for the angular momentum state , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the quantum number associated with the total spin , the orbital angular momentum , and the total angular momentum , respectively .",
    "thus the dominant fock state for a charmonium state @xmath17 is denoted @xmath33 for some appropriate values of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "for example , the dominant fock state for the @xmath4 is @xmath34 , while for the @xmath35 , it is @xmath36 .",
    "the _ color - singlet model _ is a simple model for the amplitudes for a pointlike @xmath1 pair to form a charmonium state .",
    "if the dominant fock state of the meson @xmath17 is @xmath33 , the amplitude is assumed to be 0 unless the pointlike @xmath1 pair is in a color - singlet @xmath29 state .",
    "for this state , the amplitude can be expressed in terms of the @xmath31th derivative of the radial wavefunction at the origin for the meson @xmath17 .",
    "for example , the amplitudes for producing the states @xmath37 and @xmath35 , plus some specific final state @xmath38 , are assumed to have the forms @xmath39 the @xmath40 s are amplitudes for producing color - singlet @xmath1 pairs with vanishing relative momentum in the angular - momentum states indicated .",
    "the factor @xmath41 is the radial wavefunction at the origin for the @xmath37 , while @xmath42 is the derivative of the radial wavefunction at the origin for the @xmath43 states . in the color - singlet model",
    ", it is assumed that the amplitudes @xmath40 can be calculated using perturbative qcd and that all nonperturbative effects can be absorbed into the wavefunction factors . from ( [ csm : amp - s ] ) and ( [ csm : amp - p ] ) , we deduce that the corresponding inclusive differential cross sections in the color - singlet model have the forms @xmath44 the color - singlet model has enormous predictive power .",
    "the cross section for producing a quarkonium state in any high energy process is predicted in terms of a single nonperturbative parameter for each orbital - angular - momentum multiplet .",
    "for example , the nonperturbative factor is @xmath41 for the s - wave states @xmath37 and @xmath45 .",
    "it is @xmath42 for the p - wave states @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , these parameters can be determined from decays of the charmonium states .",
    "for example , @xmath41 can be determined from the electronic width of the @xmath37 : @xmath50 thus the color - singlet model gives absolutely normalized predictions for the production rates of charmonium states in high energy collisions .    in spite of its great predictive power ,",
    "the color - singlet model is only a model .",
    "there are no theorems that guarantee that the amplitude factors in the simple way assumed in ( [ csm : amp - s ] ) and ( [ csm : amp - p ] ) .",
    "in particular , it was never proven that higher order radiative corrections would respect the factored form . in addition , the model is clearly incomplete .",
    "for one thing , relativistic corrections , which take into account the relative velocity @xmath51 of the quark and antiquark , are neglected .",
    "these corrections are probably not negligible for charmonium , since the average value of @xmath52 is only about 1/3 .",
    "the color - singlet model also assumes that a @xmath1 pair produced in a color - octet state will never bind to form charmonium .",
    "this assumption must break down at some level , since a color - octet @xmath1 pair can make a nonperturbative transition to a color - singlet state by radiating a soft gluon .",
    "the most glaring evidence that the color - singlet model is incomplete comes from the presence of infrared divergences in the cross sections for p - wave states .",
    "this problem and its solution will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "for the moment , we simply note that the infrared divergence violates the factorization assumption implicit in ( [ csm : sig - p ] ) .",
    "it implies that the cross section @xmath53 is sensitive to small momentum scales , so it can not be calculated reliably using perturbative qcd .",
    "most calculations of charmonium production prior to 1993 were based on two crucial assumptions .",
    "the first was that the amplitude for the formation of a charmonium state from a @xmath1 pair was accurately described by the color - singlet model .",
    "the second was that the dominant production processes for color - singlet @xmath1 pairs were the feynman diagrams that were lowest order in @xmath2 .",
    "the first thorough treatment of the problem of charmonium production at large transverse momentum in hadron - hadron collisions was given by baier and rckl in 1983 @xcite .",
    "in subsequent calculations @xcite , the contributions from @xmath7-meson decay into charmonium states were included .",
    "the results of these calculations are summarized below .",
    "we first introduce some terminology for describing charmonium production in high energy colliders .",
    "charmonium is called _ prompt _ if the point at which the charmonium state is produced and the collision point of the colliding beams can not be resolved using a vertex detector .",
    "prompt charmonium is produced by qcd production mechanisms .",
    "the decay of @xmath54-hadrons produces charmonium that is not prompt .",
    "if a @xmath54-hadron is produced with large transverse momentum , it will travel a significant distance before decaying weakly . for a @xmath54-hadron with @xmath0 around 10 gev , the displacement between the collision point and the secondary vertex where the charmonium is produced is typically a fraction of a millimeter .",
    "a charmonium state that is prompt , but does not come from the decay of a higher charmonium state , is called _",
    "direct_. for example , the @xmath37 is produced in the decays of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath55 with branching fractions of approximately 0.7% , 27% , 14% , and 57% , respectively .",
    "thus the prompt @xmath37 signal includes direct @xmath37 s and contributions from direct @xmath35 and direct @xmath55 .",
    "a charmonium state with large momentum is called _ isolated _ if there are no other hadrons whose momentum is nearly collinear .",
    "charmonium that is produced from the decay of a @xmath54-hadron with large transverse momentum is never isolated , because the remnant hadrons from the decay of the @xmath54-hadron will have momentum that is nearly collinear .",
    "we now consider the mechanisms for the production of charmonium with large @xmath0 in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "first we focus on charmonium production from the weak decay of @xmath54-hadrons .",
    "note that the decay of @xmath54-hadrons with large @xmath0 produces charmonium that is neither prompt nor isolated .",
    "the dominant mechanism for producing @xmath54-hadrons at large @xmath0 is the gluon fusion process @xmath56 , followed by the hadronization of the @xmath54 or @xmath57 .",
    "the inclusive branching fractions for any @xmath54-hadron to decay into charmonium states are presumably close to those for @xmath7 mesons .",
    "the inclusive branching fractions for @xmath7-meson decays are approximately 1.3% for @xmath37 , 1% for @xmath47 , and 0.5% for @xmath55 .",
    "the color - singlet model gives predictions for the production rate of charmonium from qcd mechanisms .",
    "if a @xmath1 pair is produced with large @xmath0 through parton collisions , there must be a recoiling parton to balance the transverse momentum .",
    "thus the production mechanisms that are of leading order in @xmath2 are @xmath10 parton processes .",
    "note that the charmonium states produced by these processes are prompt and isolated . in the color - singlet model ,",
    "the only @xmath10 process that can produce @xmath37 or @xmath55 is @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 processes that produce @xmath35 s with large @xmath0 are @xmath9 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the cross sections for these @xmath10 processes are all of order @xmath61 . at large @xmath0 , the parton differential cross sections @xmath62 scale like @xmath63 for the @xmath35 states and like @xmath64 for @xmath37 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus the parton cross sections for @xmath37 and @xmath55 are suppressed relative to those for @xmath35 by a factor of @xmath65 at large @xmath0 .",
    "we now summarize the predictions of the color - singlet model at leading order in @xmath2 for inclusive @xmath37 production in @xmath3 collisions @xcite .",
    "the contribution from @xmath54-hadron decay falls off the most slowly with @xmath0 and it was predicted to dominate at the tevatron for @xmath66 7 gev . of the prompt production mechanisms for @xmath37 ,",
    "the most important was found to be the decay of direct @xmath47 .",
    "the contributions from direct @xmath48 and direct @xmath37 were down by factors of about 4 and 18 at @xmath0 = 10 gev .",
    "thus the conventional wisdom before 1993 was that @xmath37 production at large @xmath0 at the tevatron should be dominated by @xmath54-hadron decay , with decays of direct @xmath47 and direct @xmath48 being the only other important mechanisms .    in the case of @xmath55 , the decay of @xmath54-hadrons",
    "was predicted to be the only important production mechanism at large @xmath0 .",
    "it should be emphasized that these predictions were based on the color - singlet model and on the additional assumption that the dominant parton processes were of order @xmath61 .",
    "the first substantial data on the production of charmonium in @xmath3 collisions came from the s@xmath3s operating at a center - of - mass energy of 630 gev .",
    "data collected by the ua1 collaboration contained indications of deviations from the predictions of the color - singlet model @xcite .",
    "the tevatron , which operates at the significantly higher energy of 1.8 tev , has provided an opportunity to investigate charmonium production in much greater detail .",
    "the cdf collaboration has accumulated large samples of data on the production of @xmath37 , @xmath35 , and @xmath55 at the tevatron .",
    "though analysis of the data from the 1988 - 1989 collider run was hampered by the inability to separate prompt charmonium from charmonium that is produced by the decays of @xmath54-hadrons , discrepancies between the data and the predictions of the color - singlet model were evident @xcite .",
    "however , assuming the conventional wisdom that @xmath37 production at large @xmath0 should be dominated by the decays of @xmath54-hadrons and direct @xmath43 s , cdf extracted a value for the @xmath54 quark cross section from their data on @xmath37 and @xmath43 production  @xcite .",
    "this value was shown to be too large by about a factor of 2 in the subsequent collider run  @xcite .",
    "before the 1992 - 93 run of the tevatron , cdf installed a silicon vertex detector that can resolve secondary vertices separated by distances greater than about 10 @xmath67 m from the @xmath68 collision point  @xcite .",
    "prompt charmonium is produced essentially at the collision point , while charmonium from the decay of @xmath54-hadrons is produced at a secondary vertex which is typically hundreds of microns away .",
    "thus the silicon vertex detector can be used to separate prompt charmonium from charmonium that is produced in @xmath54-hadron decays .    in the charmonium data sample collected during the 1992 - 93 run , it was found that only 20% of the @xmath37 s and only 23% of the @xmath55 s come from the decay of @xmath54-hadrons  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , only 32% of the @xmath37 s come from @xmath43 decay  @xcite .",
    "thus , the majority of the @xmath37 s and @xmath55 s must be produced by other mechanisms , in dramatic contradiction to the conventional wisdom .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of @xmath37 and @xmath55 from @xmath54-hadron decay does not increase appreciably with increasing @xmath0 , contrary to the predictions of the color - singlet model .",
    "an excellent review of the results on quarkonium production from the tevatron , and also from other experiments , has been presented by sansoni  @xcite .",
    "cdf has measured the cross sections for prompt @xmath37 and prompt @xmath55 production as a function of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the prompt @xmath37 signal has been resolved into those @xmath37 s that come from @xmath43 decays and those that do not  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ratio of the production rates of @xmath47 and @xmath48 has been measured .",
    "the most recent cdf data on the production of prompt @xmath37 s that do not come from @xmath43 decay , prompt @xmath37 s from @xmath43 decay , and prompt @xmath55 s , are shown in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "the prompt @xmath37 s that do not come from @xmath43 decay include direct @xmath37 s and @xmath37 s from the decay of direct @xmath55 s .",
    "the predictions of the color - singlet model at leading order in @xmath2 are shown as dashed lines .",
    "these predictions fall several orders of magnitude below the data at large @xmath0 .",
    "thus the predictions of the color - singlet model at lowest order in @xmath2 fail dramatically when confronted with the data on charmonium production from the tevatron .",
    "the first major conceptual advance in the recent revolution in heavy quarkonium production was the realization that _ fragmentation _ dominates at sufficiently large transverse momentum .",
    "fragmentation is the formation of a hadron within a jet produced by a parton ( quark , anti - quark , or gluon ) with large transverse momentum .",
    "as the parton emerges from the collision point , it radiates gluons and other partons , most of which are almost collinear .",
    "the partons ultimately coalesce into the hadrons that make up the jet . in the case of production of charmonium by fragmentation",
    ", the `` jet '' containing the charmonium state may not qualify as a jet by conventional experimental definitions .",
    "for example , if most of the momentum of the `` jet '' is carried by the charmonium state , it may not satisfy a jet criterion that requires a specified number of tracks above a certain momentum threshold .    the word _ fragmentation _ is sometimes used to describe the coalescence of partons into hadrons , whether or not these partons make up a jet .",
    "we prefer to use the word _",
    "hadronization _ to describe this general process .",
    "the word _ fragmentation _ will be reserved specifically for the formation of a hadron within the jet produced by a high-@xmath0 parton .",
    "thus fragmentation involves the hadronization of the partons in the jet , but hadronization also occurs in low energy processes that have nothing to do with jets .",
    "fragmentation is a useful concept because the probability for the formation of a hadron within a jet is universal , _",
    "i.e. _ it is independent of the process that produces the parton that initiates the jet .    in this section",
    ", we introduce the factorization theorems of perturbative qcd that guarantee that inclusive hadron production at large transverse momentum is dominated by fragmentation .",
    "we illustrate the factorization theorems using the simple example of the electromagnetic production of @xmath37 in @xmath5 decay .",
    "finally we discuss the color - singlet model predictions for the fragmentation functions of heavy quarkonium .",
    "one of the classic factorization theorems of perturbative qcd @xcite guarantees that inclusive hadron production in @xmath69 annihilation at sufficiently large energies is dominated by fragmentation . after describing this factorization theorem",
    ", we discuss its extension to inclusive hadron production at large transverse momentum in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "we consider the inclusive production of a hadron @xmath17 with energy @xmath70 in @xmath69 annihilation at large center - of - mass energy @xmath71 .",
    "we are interested in the cross section in the _ scaling limit _ in which @xmath72 with @xmath73 held fixed .",
    "the production of the hadron also involves lower momentum scales , such as the hadron mass and the scale @xmath74 associated with nonperturbative effects in qcd .",
    "the factorization theorem states that the cross section in the scaling limit has the form @xcite @xmath75 where the sum is over parton types @xmath76 and the integral is over the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath77 of the hadron @xmath17 relative to the parton @xmath76 . in ( [ fact : ee - h ] ) , @xmath78 is the differential cross section for producing a parton @xmath76 with total energy @xmath79 .",
    "this cross section is only sensitive to momenta on the order of @xmath70 , so it can be calculated using qcd perturbation theory .",
    "the effects of lower momentum scales can be systematically factored into the functions @xmath80 , which are called _ fragmentation functions _ or _ parton decay functions_. the fragmentation function @xmath80 gives the probability that the jet initiated by parton @xmath76 will include a hadron @xmath17 carrying a fraction @xmath77 of the jet momentum .",
    "the factorization theorem holds to all orders in perturbation theory . for a light hadron @xmath17 whose mass is on the order of @xmath74 , all corrections to the factorization formula ( [ fact : ee - h ] )",
    "fall like powers of @xmath81 .",
    "the essential ingredient in the proof of the factorization theorem was given by collins and sterman @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that a diagram that contributes to the inclusive cross section in the scaling limit can be separated into a hard - scattering subdiagram that produces hard partons , jet - like subdiagrams for each of the hard partons , and a soft part .",
    "the soft part includes soft gluon lines that can couple to any of the jet - like subdiagrams . after summing over all possible connections of the soft gluons",
    ", one finds that the effects of the soft parts cancel , leaving a factored form for this contribution to the inclusive cross section . in the case of inclusive hadron production ,",
    "these ideas were used by curci , furmanski , and petronzio and by collins and soper @xcite to provide field theoretic definitions of the fragmentation functions .",
    "the factorization theorem ( [ fact : ee - h ] ) requires the introduction of an arbitrary scale @xmath67 that separates the large momentum scale @xmath70 from the lower momentum scales .",
    "the parton cross sections and the fragmentation functions depend on the arbitrary scale @xmath67 in such a way that the cross section is independent of @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath67-dependence of the fragmentation functions is given by an evolution equation of the form @xmath82 the kernel @xmath83 describes the splitting of a parton @xmath76 into a parton @xmath84 with momentum fraction @xmath85 , and is calculable as a perturbation series in @xmath86 . at leading order in @xmath2",
    ", these kernels are identical to the altarelli - parisi functions that govern the evolution of parton distributions .",
    "the factorization theorem for inclusive hadron production in @xmath69 annihilation can be generalized to other high energy processes .",
    "the real power of these factorization theorems lies in the fact that the fragmentation functions are universal , _",
    "i.e. _ they are independent of the process that produces the fragmenting partons . thus ,",
    "if the fragmentation functions for a hadron @xmath17 are determined from @xmath69 annihilation data , they can be used to predict the production rate of the hadron @xmath17 in jets produced by other high energy processes .",
    "one of the important generalizations of the factorization theorem is to inclusive hadron production at large transverse momentum @xmath0 in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the proof of the factorization theorem for this process is more difficult , because there are two hadrons in the initial state .",
    "in fact , such a proof has actually been carried out only for the simpler case of the drell - yan process for creating a muon pair  @xcite .",
    "however there are no apparent obstacles to extending this proof to the case of inclusive hadron production at large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the resulting factorization formula is @xmath87 long - distance effects can be factored into the fragmentation functions and into the parton distributions @xmath88 and @xmath89 for hadrons @xmath90 and @xmath7 .",
    "the restriction to large @xmath0 is necessary in order that the jets consisting of the remnants of hadrons @xmath90 and @xmath7 after the hard scattering have large momentum relative to the jet containing hadron @xmath17 .",
    "the formula ( [ fact : ab - h ] ) should hold to all orders in perturbation theory , with corrections falling like powers of @xmath91 .",
    "implicit in ( [ fact : ab - h ] ) are three arbitrary scales : the factorization scale @xmath92 , which cancels between the parton distributions and @xmath53 , the fragmentation scale @xmath93 , which cancels between @xmath53 and the fragmentation functions , and the renormalization scale @xmath94 for the running coupling constant , which appears in @xmath53 . in low - order calculations ,",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath92 , @xmath94 should all be chosen on the order of @xmath95 , the transverse momentum of the fragmenting parton .",
    "in 1993 , braaten and yuan @xcite pointed out that the factorization theorems for inclusive hadron production must apply to heavy quarkonium as well as to light hadrons .",
    "the only difference is that the leading corrections fall as powers of @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the heavy quark mass , instead of powers of @xmath91 .",
    "therefore the dominant production mechanism for charmonium at @xmath98 must be fragmentation .",
    "in retrospect , this statement may seem obvious , but fragmentation contributions were not included in any of the previous calculations of charmonium production in @xmath3 collisions summarized in section  2.2 .",

    "second , the terms that do dominate in the asymptotic region can be factored into cross sections for producing partons and fragmentation functions .",
    "the electromagnetic production of @xmath37 is particularly simple , because the qcd interaction can be treated nonperturbatively by expressing the production amplitude in terms of a matrix element of the electromagnetic current between the qcd vacuum and a @xmath37 : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the polarization vector for the @xmath37 and @xmath103 is dimensionless .",
    "the value of @xmath103 can be determined from the decay rate for @xmath104 : @xmath105 this gives the value @xmath106 .",

    "the most glaring evidence that the color - singlet model is incomplete comes from the presence of infrared divergences in the production cross sections for p - wave states .",
    "there are analogous divergences in the annihilation decay rates for p - wave states , which were discovered by barbieri and collaborators as early as 1976 @xcite .",
    "they found that the decay rate for @xmath160 depends logarithmically on the minimum energy of the final state gluon .",
    "in phenomenological treatments of the annihilation decay rates of p - wave states , the infrared singularity was avoided by imposing an ad hoc infrared cutoff on the gluon energy .",
    "this cutoff was sometimes identified with the binding energy of the charmonium state , but without any good justification .",
    "the presence of infrared divergences in the color - singlet model is not a problem if the divergences can be absorbed into the nonperturbative factor in the cross section .",

    "similarly , the radiative corrections for p - waves include a linear infrared divergence that can be factored into @xmath162 . however , the structure of the logarithmic infrared divergences for p - waves is such that they can not be factored into @xmath162 .",
    "the solution to this problem was given by bodwin , braaten , and lepage in 1992 @xcite .",
    "they noted that the infrared divergence in the annihilation rate for @xmath160 arises when the final state gluon becomes soft .",
    "after radiating the soft gluon from either the @xmath20 or the @xmath21 in the color - singlet @xmath163 bound state , the @xmath1 pair is in a color - octet @xmath164 state .",

    "however , in the case of prompt @xmath55 production , the theoretical prediction remained about a factor of 30 below the data .",
    "this dramatic discrepancy became known as the `` cdf @xmath55 anomaly '' .",
    "the main difference between the prompt production of @xmath37 and @xmath55 is that the @xmath37 signal is fed by direct @xmath35 s , while the @xmath55 signal is not fed by any known charmonium states .",

    "the greatest weakness of the proposal to explain the cdf data by color - octet production mechanisms is that the color - octet matrix elements are free parameters that can be adjusted to fit the data .",
    "the predictive power in this proposal lies in the fact that the nrqcd matrix elements are universal , and will also enter into other charmonium production processes .",
    "the most convincing proof that the color - octet proposal is correct would be to show that the values of the matrix elements determined from the cdf data are required to explain charmonium production in other high energy processes .",
    "one possibility is @xmath5 decay , which will be discussed in section 5.2 .",
    "the color - octet fragmentation mechanism also gives other predictions that can be tested experimentally .",
    "the most dramatic prediction is that direct @xmath37 s and @xmath55 s at large @xmath0 will have a large spin alignment .",
    "cho and wise @xcite pointed out that @xmath37 s and @xmath55 s produced by color - octet gluon fragmentation tend to inherit the transverse polarization of the nearly on - shell gluon .",

    "these corrections remain small at the largest values of @xmath0 measured at the tevatron .",
    "a large transverse spin alignment is therefore a robust signature for the dominance by color - octet fragmentation of the production of direct @xmath37 s and @xmath55 s at high @xmath0 .",
    "there are other predictions of the color - octet fragmentation mechanism that can be tested at the tevatron .",
    "as pointed out by barger , fleming , and phillips , the production of two quarkonium states with large @xmath0 will be dominated by the production of two high-@xmath0 gluons which both fragment into quarkonium  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the color - octet mechanism , they found that @xmath259 events at large @xmath0 should be detectable at the tevatron .",
    "the color - octet fragmentation mechanism also gives predictions for correlations between charmonium at large @xmath0 and the other jets produced by the @xmath3 collision , but these have not yet been explored .",

    "the calculations of cho and leibovich show that fragmentation is not important in bottomonium production at the tevatron .",
    "the error from neglecting contributions that fall as @xmath65 is greater than 100% even if @xmath0 is as large as 20 gev .",
    "color - singlet and color - octet fragmentation processes in inelastic @xmath37 photoproduction at the hera @xmath264 collider have also been investigated  @xcite .",
    "the dominant contributions for values of @xmath0 accessible to experimental studies appear to be color - singlet charm quark fragmentation and color - octet processes that are suppressed by @xmath249 . in the color - octet contributions",
    "the @xmath166 pair is created at short distances in either a @xmath265 or @xmath163 state . because the numerical values of the color - octet matrix elements @xmath266 and @xmath267 are not measured very precisely it is not possible to determine which process is the dominant one at hera .",
    "however at asymptotic values of @xmath0 the fragmentation contribution will be the most important contribution .",

    "the decay of the @xmath5 provides a laboratory for the study of heavy quarkonium with large transverse momentum that is complementary to @xmath3 collisions .",
    "the color - singlet model predicts that the production rates for prompt charmonium and for bottomonium are so small that they are unlikely to be observed at lep .",

    "it is two orders of magnitude larger than the rate for @xmath269 @xcite , despite the fact that both processes are of the same order in @xmath2 .",
    "this was explained in 1993 by braaten , cheung , and yuan , who pointed out that the reason @xmath268 is so large is that this process has a fragmentation contribution that is not suppressed by @xmath270 @xcite .",

    "the color - octet terms are therefore suppressed relative to the color - singlet terms by a factor of @xmath195 from the ratio of the nrqcd matrix elements . for p - wave states ,",
    "a color - octet term in the fragmentation function is necessary to avoid an infrared divergence in the color - singlet fragmentation function .",
    "however , this divergence occurs first at next - to - leading order in @xmath2 .",
    "thus the color - octet term is not as important as it is for the case of gluon fragmentation into @xmath43 , where the divergence occurs at leading order .",
    "the production of the @xmath6 and @xmath317 at hadronic colliders like the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has recently been calculated by several groups , both through complete @xmath324 calculations @xcite and using the simpler fragmentation approximation  @xcite .",
    "discrepancies among the earlier calculations raised questions about the accuracy of the fragmentation approximation in the @xmath159 case .",
    "recent calculations @xcite have shown that the fragmentation approximation is very accurate for the @xmath6 for @xmath0 as low as 10 gev",
    ". however , for the @xmath317 , the accuracy is much lower , decreasing to 20% only for @xmath0 around 30 gev . for @xmath6 production in @xmath325 collisions , even larger values of @xmath0",
    "are required before the fragmentation approximation becomes accurate @xcite .",
    "the fact that such large values of @xmath0 are required in order for fragmentation to dominate can be attributed to the presence of an additional small parameter @xmath326 in the problem .",
    "contributions that fall off asymptotically as @xmath327 may dominate at sub - asymptotic values of @xmath0 if they are enhanced by powers of @xmath328 .",
    "the only calculations presently available for the production of the p - wave @xmath159 mesons have been carried out using the fragmentation approximation . this approach has been used by cheung and yuan to calculate the inclusive production of the @xmath6 in @xmath3 collisions , including the contributions from all the s - wave and p - wave states below the @xmath315 threshold @xcite . with acceptance cuts of @xmath329 gev and @xmath330 ,",
    "the inclusive production cross section for the @xmath6 meson at the tevatron is about 5 nb .",
    "the contributions from the excited s - wave states and from the p - wave states are 58% and 23% , respectively , and hence significant .",
    "the d - wave states were not included in this analysis since they are expected to contribute only about 2% to the inclusive production of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the search for the @xmath6 is now underway at the tevatron , and preliminary results have already been presented by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath6 is not found in the present run of the tevatron , it should certainly be discovered after the installation of the main injector , which will boost the luminosity by about a factor of 10 .",
    "the @xmath6 may also be discovered at lep .",
    "candidate events for the @xmath6 have already been reported by the aleph collaboration @xcite .",
    "the branching fraction predicted from the color - singlet processes @xmath331 and @xmath332 are @xmath333 and @xmath334 , respectively @xcite . if the fragmentation functions are used to estimate the contributions of higher s - wave , p - wave , and d - wave states , the inclusive branching fraction for @xmath6 is predicted to be larger by about a factor of 5 .",
    "the nrqcd factorization formalism provides a very general framework for analyzing the production of heavy quarkonium .",
    "it implies that the production process is much more complex than has been assumed in the color - singlet model .",
    "there are infinitely many nonperturbative matrix elements that contribute to the cross sections , although only a finite number of them contribute at any given order in @xmath52 .",
    "the most dramatic consequence of this formalism is that color - octet mechanisms sometimes give the largest contributions to the cross section . in the case of p - waves ,",
    "there is a color - octet term at leading order in @xmath52 that must be included for perturbative consistency . in the case of s - waves ,",
    "color - octet terms are suppressed by @xmath195 , but they may be important if the color - singlet term is suppressed by other small parameters such as @xmath2 .",
    "the nrqcd factorization formalism suggests an explanation for the large production rates for bottomonium and prompt charmonium that have been observed at the tevatron .",
    "they can be attributed to color - octet terms in the cross section that are important because the color - singlet terms are suppressed by powers of @xmath2 and @xmath335 .",
    "the magnitudes of the color - octet matrix elements that are required to explain the tevatron data are in accord with expectations from nrqcd .",
    "this explanation leads to many predictions that can be tested experimentally .",
    "the ultimate test is that the same matrix elements must be able to explain heavy quarkonium production in other high energy processes , such as @xmath5 decay .    in the nrqcd factorization formalism",
    ", there are many nonperturbative matrix elements that must be determined phenomenologically in order to make theoretical predictions for quarkonium production .",
    "fortunately , there is a wealth of experimental data that can be used to determine these matrix elements .",
    "quarkonium is produced as a byproduct of almost every high energy experiment . in this review , we have only discussed data from the highest - energy colliders , the tevatron and lep .",
    "however there is also data on quarkonium production from lower - energy @xmath69 and @xmath264 colliders .",
    "there is also an abundance of data on @xmath336 , @xmath207 , and @xmath337 collisions from fixed target experiments . by carrying out a comprehensive analysis of all the data on quarkonium production",
    ", it should be possible to determine most of the nrqcd matrix elements that are of phenomenological importance",
    ".    an enormous amount of theoretical work will be required in order to carry this program to completion . for every process",
    ", the production rate should be calculated to next - to - leading order in all the small parameters in the problem , including @xmath52 , @xmath2 , and kinematical parameters such as @xmath335 .",
    "most calculations until very recently were carried out within the color - singlet model , and therefore include only contributions that are of leading order in @xmath52 . even in the color - singlet model ,",
    "the only process for which the corrections at next - to - leading order in @xmath2 have been calculated is photoproduction of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the effort to calculate contributions that are beyond leading order in @xmath52 , such as color - octet production mechanisms , has just begun .",
    "while the nrqcd factorization approach provides a very general framework for analyzing quarkonium production , it should not be regarded as a complete theory .",
    "the derivation of the factorization formula breaks down when there are hadrons in the initial state if the quarkonium is produced with small transverse momentum .",
    "therefore , processes involving diffractive scattering , such as the elastic scattering process @xmath338 , are not described by this formalism .",
    "the nrqcd formalism also is not appropriate for describing the formation of charmonium from intrinsic @xmath1 pairs that come from the parton distribution of a colliding hadron @xcite .",
    "the complications of diffractive scattering and intrinsic @xmath1 pairs do not arise in the production of heavy quarkonium at large @xmath0 , and therefore the theoretical analysis of this process is particularly clean .",
    "the factorization theorems of perturbative qcd guarantee that the production is dominated by fragmentation , the formation of heavy quarkonium within `` jets '' that are initiated by single high - energy partons .",
    "the large cross sections for prompt charmonium production that have been observed at the tevatron can be explained by including a color - octet term in the gluon fragmentation function .",
    "while the normalization of the cross section is not predicted , this mechanism does give other predictions that can be tested experimentally . the most dramatic prediction",
    "is a large transverse spin alignment for direct @xmath37 and @xmath55 at large @xmath0 , but the spin alignment has not yet been measured .",
    "this mechanism also gives predictions for the correlations between high-@xmath0 charmonium states and other jets produced by the collision that can be tested .",
    "an enormous amount of theoretical work remains to be done in order to obtain precise predictions for fragmentation that can be compared with experiment .",
    "quantitative estimates of all the relevant nrqcd matrix elements are required in order to determine which terms in the fragmentation functions are numerically important .",
    "the important terms should all be calculated to next - to - leading order in @xmath2 .",
    "it is also important to calculate the power corrections to the cross sections that fall as @xmath335 , since they may give the largest corrections to some observables .    new experimental data from high - energy colliders is providing stringent tests of our understanding of the production of heavy quarkonium .",
    "the nrqcd factorization approach suggests that cross sections should be calculable in terms of the heavy - quark mass @xmath97 , the running coupling constant @xmath2 , and a few matrix elements that can be determined phenomenologically .",
    "this approach provides an explanation for the large production rates that have been observed at the tevatron and at lep , but further effort , both theoretical and experimental , will be required to show conclusively that this explanation is correct . if this effort is successful , it will mark a major milestone on the road to a comprehensive description of heavy - quarkonium production in all high energy processes .",
