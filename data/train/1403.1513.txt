    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the most fundamental concepts in physics .",
    "it provides the mechanism to generate mass of elementary particles and allows macroscopic alignment of magnetic moments in ferromagnets .",
    "spontaneous breaking of global continuous symmetry is accompanied by a massless excitation , the nambu - goldstone boson  @xcite .",
    "since nambu - goldstone boson governs low - energy physics at long distance and the low - energy physics is affected by the geometry of system , the dimensionality of the system has strong influences on nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "such effects are most prominent in one dimension ( 1d ) because of the large suppression of ordering at finite temperatures  @xcite and even at zero temperature  @xcite due to quantum effects . as a result",
    "the breaking of a continuous symmetry in 1d is deemed impossible . for systems such as a 1d superfluid ,",
    "indeed no long range order exists , and the proper description is the one of a tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll )  @xcite . despite the absence of the true long - range order  @xcite , goldstone modes exist , and have a dynamical origin  @xcite .",
    "however in some rare cases , such as a ferromagnet , the ground state can , even in 1d spontaneously break a continuous symmetry .",
    "this prompts immediately for the question of why and for which systems such phenomena can occur .    in order to shed light on the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking in 1d , dynamical aspects of the system",
    "need to be carefully considered .",
    "in addition , in view of the recent experimental progresses in realizing 1d quantum liquids in various situations  @xcite , it is worthwhile to search for novel manifestations of spontaneous symmetry breaking in 1d .    for quantum magnetism in 1d , one expects a system with quasi - long range antiferromagnetic order to have a relativistic dispersion , which is the case of the tll , while a ferromagnet would have a quadratic one .",
    "this behavior of the nambu - goldstone boson has been formulated in a quite general context  @xcite .",
    "finding in 1d a system that would spontaneously break the continuous rotational symmetry of the spins , while at the same time retaining some tll behavior would thus be interesting and an example of the more general character of nambu - goldstone boson .    a very good possibility to realize such a spontaneously magnetized tll ( smtll ) is offered by ferrimagnetic systems .",
    "several numerical studies @xcite have followed this route and found incommensurate ferrimagnetic phases which can be candidates for the smtll .",
    "however besides the numerical results , there is still no microscopic theory that explains the nature of the incommensurate phase and could relate it to a smtll .    in this paper , we present such a theory of the smtll , showing that one can have simultaneously a spontaneous breaking of the spin - rotation symmetry leading to a finite magnetization and a tll behavior . we demonstrate that this smtll phase is realized in the ground state of an @xmath0 geometrically frustrated quantum antiferromagnet on a 1d array of the union jack lattice [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : lattice ] ] .",
    "we consider the union jack ( uj ) spin hamiltonian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 denotes the imbalance of the diagonal interactions . throughout the paper ,",
    "we fix @xmath4 and change the ratio @xmath5 from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . note that this model has _ a priori _ full spin - rotational symmetry .",
    "we first consider the classical ground state minimizing the energy of a unit cell .",
    "the classical analysis on the uj ladder is similar to the 2d uj antiferromagnet  @xcite . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the classical ground state is the nel state . for @xmath9 , spins on the filled sites in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ]  ( a ) become canted with a polar angle @xmath10 and the classical ground state in the canted phase has an incommensurate magnetization , @xmath11 hereafter we use @xmath12 for simplicity . at the classical level , a spontaneous magnetization occurs .",
    "however , since quantum fluctuation usually destroys long - range order in 1d systems , we have to take them into account to conclude on the existence of a spontaneous magnetization in 1d .      to do so we derive the low - energy effective field theory of the uj ladder .",
    "when the diagonal interaction is small enough , @xmath13 , the low - energy effective field theory is written as a function of two slowly varying fields @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the lattice spacing .",
    "we take a diagonal unit cell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagonal ] ) to define @xmath16 and @xmath17 along the @xmath18 bond  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 fields denote respectively staggered and uniform magnetization densities and satisfy the constraints @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the constraint is usually replaceable to @xmath21 .",
    "however , the @xmath22 term will play an essential role for our purpose .",

    "while @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend on a @xmath29 matrix of microscopic parameters , @xmath30 with @xmath31 , the topological angle is determined only by the number of legs .",
    "the derivation of the effective field theory   is explained in the case of the three - leg spin ladder in refs .  .",
    "we obtain the effective field theory by replacing the rung coupling of the three - leg ladder to @xmath32 in the matrix .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "that information on the structure of the uj lattice is encoded in the matrix . integrating @xmath17 out , we obtain  @xcite @xmath33 + i\\theta q ,    \\label{eq : h_nlsm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath34 gives an integer after integrating with an imaginary time @xmath35 , that is , @xmath36 .",
    "the hamiltonian is the @xmath37 nonlinear @xmath38 model ( nlsm ) .",
    "the @xmath26 term controls the low - energy limit of the nlsm  @xcite . when @xmath39 ( mod @xmath40 ) , namely when @xmath41 is a half integer , the @xmath37 nlsm is identical to the tll as a conformal field theory with a central charge @xmath42  @xcite , @xmath43 .",

    "the nature of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 fields will be discussed in detail later .",
    "since @xmath26 is independent of @xmath18 , for small enough @xmath18 , the diagonal interaction is irrelevant and the uj ladder has the tll ground state , and thus in particular zero spontaneous magnetization .",
    "however the diagonal interaction has a serious impact on the ground state , and lead to an instability of the tll .",
    "the diagonal interaction @xmath18 partly compensates @xmath47 in the matrix and it reduces the velocity down to @xmath48 where the linearization of the dispersion relation @xmath49 becomes invalid . let us denote the instability point as @xmath50 .",
    "the instability point is determined from the zeros of the matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath51 is positive definite for @xmath52 .",
    "as we increase @xmath53 , the positive definiteness first breaks down at @xmath54 , namely @xmath55 when @xmath56 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be expanded with respect to @xmath57 .",

    "thus , the susceptibility @xmath65 of the tll diverges as @xmath61 .    near the instability point",
    "@xmath66 , a careful treatment of the interaction is required .",
    "the interaction of the @xmath37 nlsm is non - perturbatively included in the constraint .",
    "namely , the partition function @xmath67 of the @xmath37 nlsm is given as a path integral , @xmath68 the constraint generates a strong repulsion @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , one can add a strongly repulsive interaction @xmath70 with @xmath71 to the hamiltonian instead of imposing the constraint .",
    "then , the partition function is approximated as @xmath72 where we obtain the hamiltonian @xmath73 with the effective repulsion , @xmath74 ,    \\label{eq : h_nlsm_l4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 we introduced the quartic interaction @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 because their difference ( e.g. @xmath79 ) is negligible as we see below .",
    "when @xmath80 , the following inequalities are valid : @xmath81 thus , the interaction that the @xmath82 field feels takes a form of the wine bottle : @xmath83 the potential leads to a nonvanishing expectation value of @xmath84 .",
    "note that the instability occurs only in the uniform part of the @xmath37 nlsm because of the inequalities and .",
    "the diagonal coupling only changes the sign of the coupling constant of the @xmath85 [ eq .  ] keeping that of @xmath86 positive ( eq .  ) .",
    "namely , the instability only occurs at the wave number @xmath46 and the nonzero expectation value of the @xmath82 field is attributed to the magnetization density @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the ground state has a _ spontaneous magnetization _ per site , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 the transition around @xmath50 is described by a ginzburg - landau like theory of second order transitions .",
    "contrarily to the @xmath77 term , the higher - order interaction @xmath79 is negligible because the lower - order term @xmath86 is stable . since @xmath89 the transition can not be first order .",
    "we emphasize that our derivation of the spontaneous magnetization fully respects the @xmath64 rotational symmetry and @xmath90 can point in an arbitrary direction .",
    "let us explain the nature of nambu - goldstone boson generated from this phase transition .",
    "first we focus on the @xmath46 part .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of fluctuation @xmath91 we can assume @xmath92 without loss of generality .",

    "however , after including renormalization due to irrelevant operators , the coupling constant @xmath104 of the anisotropic interaction actually deviates from that of the isotropic part @xmath103 . here",
    "we first omit the anisotropy and include it later perturbatively because it does not modify qualitative features of the effective hamiltonian of the nambu - goldstone boson .",

    "<S> we develop a theory of spontaneously magnetized tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( smtll ) in geometrically frustrated quasi - one - dimensional quantum magnets by taking an @xmath0 ferrimagnet on a union - jack lattice as an example . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a strong frustration leads to a spontaneous magnetization because of the ferrimagnetic nature of lattice . due to the ferrimagnetic order </S>",
    "<S> , the local magnetization has an incommensurate oscillation with the position . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the spontaneously magnetized tll is smoothly connected to the existence of a nambu - goldstone boson in the canted ferrimagnetic phase of a two - dimensional frustrated antiferromagnet . </S>"
