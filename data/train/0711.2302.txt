    "a major challenge to our current understanding of structure and galaxy formation in the universe is the discrepancy between the theoretically predicted mass function of dark matter haloes and the observed shape of the luminosity function of galaxies ( kauffmann & white 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ; somerville , primack & faber 2001 ; benson et al . 2003 ) .",
    "simply put , the number density of dark matter haloes falls off as a power - law at high masses , whereas the luminosity function of galaxies occupying such haloes terminates exponentially above a characteristic luminosity ( e.g. cole et al .",
    "2001 ; huang et al .",
    "this implies that the supply of gas to a galaxy and the conversion of this gas into stars becomes preferentially inefficient in more massive systems ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "a key issue for galaxy formation theory is thus to illuminate the physical processes that heat and cool gas in massive galaxies as this cycle regulates the formation of new stars .",
    "in addition , one of the challenges for galaxy formation is to unravel the inter - play of baryons with the ubiquitous dark matter in galaxies .    to this end ,",
    "feedback processes operating in galaxies at both the low and high - mass ends of the halo mass function are required to explain the faint and bright - end slopes of the observed galaxy luminosity function .",
    "energy input from supernovae is thought to play a significant role in the regulation of star formation in low mass galaxies ( dekel & silk 1986 ; mac low & ferrara 1999 ) , however the supernova energy injected in high mass galaxies is too small to suppress gas cooling effectively . for such objects , to reconcile theory with observations a more energetic process that continually heats the gas and operates independently of star formation appears to be required ( croton et al . 2006 ; bower et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "recent observations in nearby galaxies reveal a correlation between the masses of supermassive black holes and the velocity dispersion of the stellar component .",
    "this suggests that black holes might play a role in regulating star formation ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; ferrarese & merritt 2002 ) . energy input from nuclear outflows driven by accreting black holes are currently favoured as the principal source of feedback driving the truncation of star formation in massive galaxies ( di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ; croton et al . 2006 ; bower et al . 2006 ) .",
    "unlike supernovae feedback , the observed energy output from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can far exceed that liberated from cooling gas in the hot halo .",
    "agn heating in two distinct forms has been proposed .",
    "episodic feedback from the agn via outflows generated during the merger process have been proposed by di matteo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; sijacki & springel ( 2006 ) , the so - called ` quasar - mode ' .",
    "however , it is known that agn spend most of their lifetimes in a low accretion rate state , and therefore croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and bower et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argue for a more steady , so called ` radio - mode ' feedback that is long - lived .",
    "the details of both these processes are complex and the micro - physics is currently not well understood .    here",
    ", we focus on an alternative heating mechanism , the energy steadily generated by the self - annihilation of dark matter particles in the inner regions of haloes .",
    "although the standard cosmological paradigm is predicated on the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) particles , the precise nature of these particles and their interactions remain a puzzle .",
    "the neutralino is the current leading dark matter candidate . in this paper",
    "we explore if the energy supplied from the self - annihilation of dark matter in the centres of galaxies and cluster haloes could possibly play a significant role in the baryonic cooling / heating cycle ( ascasibar 2007 ; totani 2004 ; 2005 ; colafrancesco et al .",
    "detailed astrophysical implications of neutralino dark matter annihilations in galaxy clusters , with a specific application to the coma cluster have been calculated by colafrancesco , profumo & ullio ( 2006 ) .",
    "they performed a thorough analysis of the transport and diffusion properties of neutralino annihilation products , and investigated the resulting multi - frequency signals , from radio to gamma - ray frequencies .",
    "they also study other relevant astrophysical effects of neutralino annihilations , like the dm - induced sunyaev - zeldovich effect and the intracluster gas heating .",
    "annihilation luminosity is expected to be produced as a result of an enhancement in the density of the dark matter distribution in the inner - most regions of galaxies , due to the response of the dark matter to the adiabatic growth of a central black hole ( gondolo & silk 1999 ) and/or to the adiabatic compression suffered by the dark matter due to the collapse of baryons into the dark matter potential well ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ; ryden & gunn 1987 ; gnedin et al .",
    "2004 ) . by including this steady heating source of annihilating neutralinos to suppress cooling flow gas in a sophisticated model of galaxy formation",
    ", we explore the effect of various key parameters in reproducing the bright - end of the observed galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the question we address is whether self - annihilation can provide an alternative mechanism to agn driven feedback within the context of the current paradigm .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ section2 ]",
    "we discuss the physics of neutralino annihilation ; a scenario for the coupling of this energy source to baryons in galactic nuclei is explored in section  [ section3 ] . with this phenomenology developed",
    ", we incorporate this feedback scheme into a galaxy formation model .",
    "the details of the n - body simulation and galaxy formation model used in this implementation are discussed in section  [ section4 ] .",
    "our results are presented in detail in section  [ section5 ] and summarized in section  6 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results and comparison of annihilation heating with other modes of feedback . unless otherwise stated we assume hubble constant parametrised as @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "theoretical predictions of structure formation and evolution in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmogony appear to be in very good agreement with current observations on most scales bar perhaps the smallest ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ; tegmark et al .",
    "2004 ; seljak et al . 2005 ; cole et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this well established paradigm , the bulk of the matter in the universe is comprised of cold , collisionless particles that seed the formation of structures from the gravitational amplification of their early fluctuations ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1984 ; davis , efstathiou , frenk & white 1985 ) .    weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are the currently favoured dark matter candidates as their cross - sections are small enough that they act as essentially collisionless particles ( kolb & turner 1990 ) .",
    "the super - symmetric _ neutralino _ , arising in minimal super - symmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics , is probably the most widely studied wimp candidate ( see review by jungman , kamionkowski & griest 1996 and references therein ) . in the minimal super - symmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the super - partners of the gauge bosons and the neutral higgs bosons , respectively called binos and higgsinos , mix into four majorana fermionic mass eigenstates , called neutralinos . in some regions of the super - symmetric parameter space ,",
    "the lightest neutralino can naturally achieve a relic density that matches the observed cosmic dm abundance , thus making it a theoretically well motivated dm candidate",
    ". the neutralino mass can be anywhere between @xmath3 gev , which is the lower bound allowed by accelerator constraints ( eidelman et al .",
    "2006 , see _ ibidem _ for the set of assumptions made on the underlying super - symmetric scenario ) , up to 100 tev in some extreme non - perturbative scenarios ( profumo 2005 ) , although masses larger than a few tev are commonly considered as `` unnatural '' , if one wants susy to solve the theoretical problems ( such as the hierarchy problem ) for which it was originally invented .",
    "an interesting alternative candidate arises in theories with universal extra dimensions ( ued ) , and corresponds to the first kaluza - klein state of the hypercharge gauge boson ( appelquist , cheng and dobrescu , 2002 ; servant and tait 2000 ) .",
    "the existence of a viable dark matter candidate in ued theories can be seen as a consequence of the conservation of momentum in a higher dimensional space . to generate chiral fermions at the zero mode",
    ", the extra dimensions must be modded out by an orbifold , leading to the conservation of the so - called kk - parity , such that all odd - level kk particles are charged under this symmetry , thus ensuring that the lightest ( first level ) kk state is stable .",
    "a lower bound on the mass of the lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) comes from electroweak measurements , and depending on the mass of the higgs , it can be as low as @xmath4 gev ( gogoladze and macesanu 2006 ) .",
    "although the annihilation cross section in these scenarios is fixed by the lkp mass , it is possible to achieve the correct relic density even for particles as heavy as several tev , provided that one includes the effect of co - annihilation with other kk particles ( burnell & kribs 2006 , kong & matchev 2006 , kakizaki et al .",
    "we note that the arguments presented here are valid more generally for any thermal relic wimp candidate with s - wave annihilation .    regardless of its precise nature , it is possible to set cosmological constraints on the wimp mass @xmath5 under some simplifying , but rather general assumptions on its nature .",
    "the wimp mass is in fact constrained to be roughly @xmath6 and @xmath7 , by theoretical considerations of the thermal freeze - out in the early universe ( e.g. bertone , hooper and silk 2005 ) .",
    "the very same theoretical considerations suggest that the wimp annihilation rate in the local universe is far below the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "however , annihilations proceed in high density dm regions , such as the centres of dm haloes .",
    "we demonstrate in this work that this resultant annihilation luminosity could play an important role in galaxy formation by providing a strong source of feedback which prevents gas from cooling and forming stars in galaxies .",
    "wimp pair annihilation in high dm density regions will inevitably produce high energy neutrinos , positrons , anti - protons and gamma - rays .",
    "there are several on - going and future experiments focused on direct and indirect searches for the signature of neutralinos ( see reviews by bergstrom 2002 ; bertone , hooper & silk 2004 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on gev mass - scale wimps , however for illustration purposes we also calculate the consequence of heating by mev dm .",
    "here we describe the key ingredients of the simple theoretical model constructed to estimate the self - annihilation luminosity of dm in the centres of galaxy and cluster scale haloes . in the concordance @xmath8cdm cosmology the thermally averaged annihilation rate of wimps , in absence of co - annihilations ,",
    "is related to the dm relic density by @xmath9 . from this expression",
    "one can estimate the annihilation luminosity from neutralinos in a halo with a given density profile ( assuming they constitute all the dark matter ) : @xmath10 where the integral is performed over the halo volume @xmath11 , @xmath5 is the wimp mass , and @xmath12 is the dark matter density profile , commonly assumed to be spherically - symmetric , making it only dependent on the galactocentric radial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "the density profile of a dark matter haloes that assemble in cosmological n - body simulations is well fit by the following parametrised functional form , referred to as the generalised navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) : @xmath14^{(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha } } ~ , \\label{profile } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 govern the slope of the profile on large and small scales respectively , with a transition in slope at the scale radius @xmath18 , defined as the ratio of the virial radius of the dm halo , @xmath19 , and the virial concentration parameter , @xmath20 : @xmath21 in this paper we only consider profiles for which the outer slope is @xmath22 , i.e. where @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the normalisation constant , @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the virial mass of the system .",
    "the slope of the density profile in the inner regions of the halo @xmath17 is of interest for our work .",
    "a value of @xmath27 refers to the nfw profile , while @xmath28 corresponds to the so - called moore profile ( moore et al .",
    "note that eqn .",
    "( [ profile ] ) is a fit to the output of numerical simulations which do not include either particle physics and hydrodynamic effects .",
    "such effects may alter the distribution of dm over time .",
    "the consequences of this possibility are discussed in the next section .",
    "in fact , it is the time evolution of the density profile that holds the key to possibly tapping the energy from the neutralino self - annihilation .",
    "we briefly note here that for a cluster scale dm halo , with typical virial mass   10@xmath29 , the luminosity generated from eqn .",
    "( [ lum ] ) with central density profile @xmath30 is , at most , of order @xmath31 ergs@xmath32 .",
    "thus , even if this entire energy output coupled maximally to the cooling gas in the inner regions it would be insufficient to offset the cooling luminosity ( of order @xmath33 ergs@xmath32 ) in a typical cluster system ( totani 2004 ; 2005 ) .",
    "physical processes that further steepen the inner density profile slope are therefore required to make the annihilation viable as a feedback mechanism .",
    "fortunately , several astrophysical processes in the centres of dark matter haloes are expected to affect the density profile of dm in precisely the required fashion .",
    "density enhancements can arise in the inner regions of dark matter haloes from a number of different astrophysical processes .",
    "one such process is the adiabatic response of the dark matter to the infall and collapse of baryons ( blumenthal , flores & primack 1986 ; ryden & gunn 1987 ; gnedin et al .",
    "baryonic gas loses energy through radiative processes and falls into the centre of a dark matter halo to form stars . as a result of this redistribution of mass , the gravitational potential of the inner regions of the halo changes",
    "the dark matter responds to the subsequent deepening of the potential by altering its distribution and thereby enhancing its density .",
    "the increase in dark matter density from adiabatic compression can be calculated using adiabatic invariants . the cusp index @xmath17 in the nfw profile of eqn .",
    "( 2 ) steepens to a value that depends on the density profile of the baryons .",
    "earlier calculations by blumenthal et al.(1986 ) over - predicted the steepening due to the assumptions of spherical symmetry and circular orbits .",
    "this was due , in part , to the fact that haloes in the hierarchical structure formation scenarios grow via multiple violent mergers and accretion along filaments , and particle orbits in the haloes are highly eccentric .",
    "gnedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) revisited this question using high - resolution cosmological simulations that included gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and star formation .",
    "they found that the dissipation of gas indeed increased the density of dark matter and steepened its radial profile in the inner parts of the halo when compared with haloes without cooling .",
    "comparisons with the earlier work of blumenthal et al.(1986 ) showed that the assumption of spherical symmetry induces a systematic over - prediction of the density enhancement in the inner 5% of the virial radius .",
    "gnedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) correct for this by providing a simple modification of the assumed adiabatic invariant which includes orbit - averaged particle positions .",
    "if the baryons have a radial density profile @xmath34 , then the spike ( i ) retains the same slope if @xmath35 ; ( ii ) or if @xmath36 , the contracted inner slope of the dm profile is steeper than its original value . for @xmath37",
    ", the final inner dm density slope can be as steep as @xmath38 , respectively . in cluster sized systems ,",
    "although baryons represent only a small fraction of the overall mass , they may be crucially important on scales comparable to the extent of the typical brightest , central cluster galaxies .",
    "there has been a lot of recent activity in the simulations community to understand the likely interactions between baryons and dark matter ( gnedin et al .",
    "2004 ; nagai & kravtsov 2005 ; faltenbacher et al . 2005 ; gustafsson , fairbairn & sommer - larsen 2006 ) .",
    "for instance , in a recent simulation that included baryons , gustafsson , fairbairn and sommer - larsen ( 2006 ) claim that the central dm cusps steepen to @xmath39 , with an indication of the inner logarithmic slope converging on galaxy mass scales .",
    "gustaffson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) claim that the difference in the extent of adiabatic contraction and subsequent response they find compared to gnedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and other works originates in the differences in their stellar feedback prescription .",
    "so the extent of steepening due to adiabatic response is an unsettled issue at the present time due to the inherent uncertainity in the our understanding and implementation of star formation in simulations . on the observational side",
    "there have also been many recent attempts to disentangle the dark matter and baryonic components in clusters ( zappacosta et al .",
    "2006 ; biviano & salucci 2006 ; mahdavi et al .",
    "2007 ; sand et al . 2008 ) .",
    "extensive convergence studies have shown that modern highest resolution dissipationless simulations agree in their predictions : the average logarithmic slope of the density profile at @xmath40 is @xmath41 , with a substantial scatter of @xmath42 from object to object ( fukushige et al .",
    "2004 ; tasitsiomi et al . 2004 ; navarro et al .",
    "2004 ; reed et al . 2004 ; diemand et al . 2004 ; 2005 ) . at the same time , despite a significant decrease in the smallest reliably resolved scale , the logarithmic slope continues to get shallower with decreasing radius without reaching an asymptotic value . for the purposes of this work , for our default model we will assume a conservative value for the inner slope of the density profile of @xmath43 , which is the standard nfw value commonly used .",
    "on extremely small scales @xmath44 , i.e. at the very centre of the galaxy hosted by a dm halo , the gravitational potential is dominated not by dm ( as described by eqn .",
    "[ profile ] ) but by baryons , mainly comprising stars and frequently a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "in fact , from the demography of nearby galaxies it appears that nearly every galaxy hosts a smbh , and their masses are well correlated with properties of the stellar component in the inner - most regions ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; ferrarese & merritt 2002 ) . in our own galaxy , for instance , stars exhibit a cusp inside a few parsecs described by ( genzel et al .",
    "2003 ) : @xmath45 this distribution is centred around the supermassive black hole at the galactic centre , whose mass is estimated to lie in the range @xmath46 ( ghez et al . 2005 ; genzel et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "in fact , hooper , finkbeiner & dobler ( 2007 ) claim that the excess microwave emission from the region around the center of our galaxy detected by wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) could be synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons generated in dark matter annihilations .",
    "hooper et al . ( 2007 ) find that the angular distribution of this `` wmap haze '' matches the prediction for dark matter annihilations with a cusped density profile , @xmath47 in the inner few kiloparsecs .",
    "comparing the intensity in different wmap frequency bands , they find that a wide range of possible wimp annihilation modes are consistent with the spectrum of the haze for a wimp with a mass in the 100 gev to multi - tev range .",
    "most interestingly , they find that to generate the observed intensity of the haze , the dark matter annihilation cross section is required to be approximately equal to the value needed for a thermal relic , @xmath48 @xmath49/s .",
    "more generally , the _ adiabatic _ growth of a massive object at the centre of a power - law distribution of dm with index @xmath17 induces a redistribution of the dm ( also referred to as a density ` spike ' ) , into a new power - law with a steepened index @xmath50 ( peebles 1972 , young 1980 , ipser & sikivie 1987 , quinlan et al .",

    "this defines the inner spike radius , @xmath63 .      in order to understand the time evolution of a dm density spike",
    ", we note that once the spike is established several astrophysical and particle physics effects act to disrupt it .",
    "the three principal effects that can damp a density spike are : ( i ) the self - annihilation process itself that depletes dm ( discussed above ) , ( ii ) the interaction between the dm and the surrounding baryons near the smbh , and ( iii ) spike disruption during galaxy ( or more specifically black hole ) mergers .",
    "dm and baryons interact gravitationally with each other , and stars typically have significantly larger kinetic energies than dm particles . gravitational encounters between these two populations will tend to drive them toward equipartition of energy , causing the dm to heat up , flattening the spike while retaining the shape of the density profile .",
    "as shown by bertone & merritt ( 2005a ; 2005b ) , the resultant spike evolution with time can be modelled as an exponential decay via @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the time elapsed since the original spike formation @xmath59 measured in units of the heating time @xmath67 , @xmath68 we show results for the time evolution of a fiducial spike in at the centre of our galaxy in figure  1 and discuss the issue further in section  5.1 .",
    "mergers of black holes , and in particular major mergers ( i.e. smbh mass ratios greater than 0.3 ) , are efficient at flattening or destroying density spikes ( merritt et al .",
    "we note that the disruption is maximal during equal mass mergers , however these are extremely rare . after a merger",
    "the density spike will be re - established on a time - scale comparable to the relaxation time of stars ( merritt , harfst and bertone 2006 ) .",
    "if major mergers are too frequent then spikes will not be long - lived enough to enhance the annihilation luminosity .",
    "however , if they never happen the spike decay described above will result in inefficient heating .",
    "we encapsulate spike disruption in eqn .",
    "( [ limdens ] ) by following the time since the last smbh major merger in each halo , @xmath59 , which approximates the spike lifetime .",
    "the major merger rate in the simulation and galaxy formation model is discussed further in section  [ sec : spikes ] .",
    "using all the above computed quantities , we can finally estimate the time dependent annihilation luminosity at any time after the most recent smbh major merger as : @xmath69 @xmath70 in the limit that @xmath71 . in",

    "to explore the effects of the heating of cooling gas in the hot halo from neutralino annihilation we employ a model of galaxy formation ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ) coupled to a high resolution n - body simulation , the so - called ` millennium run ' ( springel et al .",
    "below we give only a brief outline of these techniques ; the interested reader should refer to croton et al ( 2006 ) and references therein for further details . in the following sub - sections we describe the addition of neutralino heating to this model .",

    "virialised dark matter haloes at each redshift are assumed to attract ambient gas from the surrounding medium , from which galaxies form and evolve .",
    "the galaxy formation model effectively tracks a wide range of physics in each halo , including reionization of the inter - galactic medium at high redshift , including radiative cooling of hot gas and the formation of cooling flows , star formation in the cold disk and the resulting supernova feedback , black hole growth , metal enrichment of the inter - galactic and intra - cluster medium , and galaxy morphology shaped through mergers and merger induced starbursts .    more specifically , once a dark matter halo has grown in mass to approximately @xmath77 infalling baryons no longer fall ` cold ' on to the central galaxy but instead shock heat to the virial temperature of the dark matter halo to form a quasi - static hot atmosphere ( croton et al . 2006 ) .",
    "as the density of hot gas increases the cooling time near the centre of the halo becomes short and a cooling flow of condensing gas forms .",

    "for low mass haloes heating and expulsion of baryonic material by supernovae can prevent over - cooling , but on group and cluster scales , while the observed baryon fraction has the universal value ( balogh et al .",
    "2001 ) , state of the art hydrodynamical simulations find a significantly larger fraction of cooled gas ( borgani et al .",
    "2003 ; kravtsov , nagai & vikhlinin 2005 ) .",
    "in fact in clusters the problem is particularly severe ; observationally the x - ray luminosities in many clusters imply cooling rates in the inner regions of @xmath91 100 - 1000 @xmath92 ( e.g. fabian & nulsen 1977 ; edge 2001 ; fabian 2004 ) , whereas little or no associated star formation is detected .",
    "a decrease in x - ray gas temperature is often seen in the centres of clusters but x - ray spectroscopy detects very little cool gas below @xmath93 k at temperatures of @xmath94 ( peterson et al .",
    "2001 ; 2003 )",
    ".    therefore it has been known for some time ( see fabian 1994 and references therein ) , the measured cooling times at the centre of observed clusters of galaxies are significantly shorter than the hubble time .",
    "this implies that gas condensation should be occurring from the conventional picture described above , however none is observed , nor are the secondary effects of cooling such as copious star formation in the central brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "such galaxies are mostly found to be ` red and dead ' .",
    "this behaviour may indicate the presence of a heat source that is supplying energy to the cooling gas to keep the central regions from condensing .",
    "this is the so - called classical ` cooling flow problem ' ( fabian 1994 ) .    to arrest the expected runaway cooling in massive systems",
    "a heat source must be present .",
    "we test the idea of whether the heating from dark matter annihilation at the centres of massive systems can plausibly be a global solution to the cooling flow problem described above .",
    "another key aspect of the cooling flow problem is the fact that the cooling time of gas is short over a fairly large range of radii , particularly in groups and clusters , implying that the heating rate of any proposed mechanism ought to balance the cooling at all radii .",

    "our heating rates must be treated with caution ; they are simply a relative measure that defines an upper limit on the energy required to stop gas from cooling .",
    "however , relative to the cooling rate they are expected to be accurate for the model .",
    "more detailed models can be constructed to take into account the past heating history when calculating the current cooling rate , but these estimates would be complicated and highly unconstrained .",
    "for example , the temperature and density gas profiles could change as a function of the energy injected , depth of potential , and redshift , for every galaxy in an evolving universe .",
    "these detailed and self - consistent responses of the baryons need to be taken into account . however , such improvements add considerable complexity that is beyond the scope of the present work .",

    "as discussed in sections  3.1 and 3.3 , the luminosity produced from dark matter annihilation in an unsteepened nfw - type halo falls short by several orders - of - magnitude when compared to the cooling losses from the x - ray emitting hot gas . for annihilations to be a plausible solution to the cooling flow problem one requires an enhancement of the dm density in the inner most regions of the galaxy , usually assumed to be produced by the presence of a super - massive black hole or in response to the adiabatic compression of baryons or perhaps both these processes .    when present , density spikes are expected to evolve with time due to the annihilation itself . to illustrate this , in fig .",

    "dark matter density spikes are fragile and transient  a major merger can easily destroy a spike on a short time - scale",
    ". however , it is unclear whether the disruption is triggered by the merger of the dark matter haloes , central black holes or galaxies hosted in the haloes .",
    "the merger rates for these three populations of objects are not necessarily the same , and yet a typical approximation adopted is to the use extended press - schechter ( eps ) theory to obtain the merger rate .",
    "however eps only describes the properties of dm haloes . in reality",
    "it is probably the mergers of black holes that ought be most significant for the evolution of a density spike .    using our cosmological model of galaxy formation we can check the frequency of mergers for haloes , galaxies , and the black holes that reside within them . in fig .",
    "[ fig : merger_rate ] we show for each object the mean number of major mergers at @xmath132 .",
    "we focus on this redshift range because it is primarily only at late times wherein heating is needed to prevent the cooling of gas in haloes .",

    "we consider two halo mass ranges for each , galaxy scales masses ( @xmath140 , dashed lines ) and cluster masses ( @xmath141 , solid lines ) .",
    "our default model assumes common values for each of @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 ( nfw ) , and @xmath145 ( the sphere of influence of the black hole ) . in each panel",
    "we vary one parameter keeping the rest fixed to clearly show the plausible range of heating rates that can be expected from the model ( the default values of each parameter are marked by vertical dotted lines ) .",
    "in addition , the top left panel shows the expected cooling rate assuming a hot gas fraction of 0.1 .",
    "the choice of 10% for the host gas fraction is motivated by the x - ray observations in galaxy groups and clusters ( laroque et al .",
    "2006 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "2006 ; gonzalez , zaritsky & zabludoff 2007 ) .",
    "this is approximately the energy the dm heating needs to replenish .",
    "it is clear that even in the presence of density spikes it is usually difficult to produce enough flux to reheat all the cooling gas , and this is true for haloes of all masses ranging from galaxy scales to cluster scales .",
    "enhancement of between 1 - 2 orders - of - magnitude does occur when mergers are more frequent ( this works to offset the exponential decay of the spike amplitude shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spike_evol ] ) or for lower mass dm particle candidates .",
    "however the heating luminosity is still significantly lower when compared with the cooling rate shown in the top left panel .",
    "the bottom two panels of fig .  [ fig : heating ] show how sufficient heating can be produced , either through significant steepening of the inner dm halo density profile ( on which the spike sits ) , or a significantly larger outer spike radius or both .",
    "for galaxy - scale dm haloes annihilation heating can balance cooling whenever the inner density profile is steepened to values of @xmath146 , and for cluster - scale haloes when @xmath147 .",
    "similarly large values for the outer spike radius , @xmath148 on galaxy scales and @xmath149 on cluster scales , are required for annihilation heating to compensate for the gas cooling .",
    "although observationally the inner dm halo profile remains unconstrained on extremely small scales , it may be difficult to produce such steep slopes or large spike radii on the scales required for all galaxies and clusters , in order to effectively influence global properties .",
    "another challenge for our model is the requirement that heating and cooling balance needed at all radii as the cooling time for the gas is short for a range of radii specially on group and cluster scales .",
    "as developed here self - annihilation dumps all the energy at very small radii and here we assume due to lack of a more complete understanding at the present that all that energy is also thermalized efficiently at small radii .",
    "while this could lead to the generation of large entropy inversions in the x - ray gas that are typically not observed ( voit & donahue 2005 ) ; we argue that there are other efficient energy transport processes like thermal conduction available to deposit energy at larger radii ( ruszkowski & begelman 2002 ; ruszkowski , bruggen & begelman 2004 ) .",
    "it is useful to point out here that even for the alternative agn feedback that have been proposed the astrophysical process that couple radiation to baryons in the inner regions of galaxies , groups and clusters is poorly understood at present ( mccarthy et al .",
    "this is clearly a rich avenue for future work for all currently proposed feedback models .",
    "the suppression of cooling flow gas in massive haloes can have a dramatic effect on evolution of the galaxies that reside in them .",
    "this is due to the fact that across cosmic time , a growth of a galaxy is dictated by the availability and supply of star forming material . at late times",
    "this mostly comes in the form of gas condensing out of the hot halo .",
    "hence , any mechanism that suppresses gas cooling ultimately also prevents the galaxy from further star formation . our goal is to investigate under what circumstances the evolving density spikes explored in section  [ sec : spikes ] and the resultant heating model described in section  [ sec : heating ] can actually shut down star formation in massive galaxies when the full hierarchical evolution of galaxies is taken into account .    in a set of three figures , fig .",

    "[ fig : heating ] .",
    "the remaining lines in each figure illustrate the consequences of different parameter choices for the annihilation heating prescription , with each figure focused on a specific set of parameters that tune the annihilation heating model .",
    "as can been seen from all the luminosity function figures , the default model significantly overpredicts the abundance of the brightest galaxies .",
    "this is a consequence of inefficient annihilation flux heating for the default model , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : heating ] .",
    "essentially overcooling occurs in the centers of group and cluster systems , leading to excess star formation and overly bright and massive galaxies .",
    "note that this is not necessarily a failure of our underlying galaxy formation model - the cooling flow problem has a long history ( see review by fabian 2004 for details ) and failure of the default heating model is simply another manifestation of it ( in the absence of strong enough heating ) .",
    "the two additional lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfs1 ] , dotted - dashed and solid , show the galaxy luminosity function when the inner dm halo slope is steepened to @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively ( the default model has @xmath153 , the standard nfw profile ) .",
    "an inner slope of @xmath0 appears to be insufficient to produce enough heating , even with the presence of a central density spike .",
    "only inner halo slopes of @xmath154 or steeper are able to do this . in the context of current models",
    "such steep slopes do not arise naturally in dark matter haloes .",
    "a combination of steepening mechanisms needs to operate in a coordinated fashion to achieve these slopes .",
    "[ fig : lfs2 ] considers the combination of a steeper inner halo slope , here @xmath155 , and more extreme values for the inner and outer spike radii explored previously in fig .",

    "the plots emphasize that the equations predict that the heating flux comes from well inside the cooling radius . due to the simplicity of our assumed cooling model ( i.e. that the gas is isothermal ) it is not possible to accurately determine the cooling rate as a function of radius inside individual halos for a direct radial comparison of the heating cooling balance . in the context of our simple model",
    "as shown we can however calculate the global heating and cooling rates and compare .",
    "these plots also show that the heating from self - annihilation akin to other modes of feedback needs to propagate out to larger radii to be effective .",
    "the microphysics of these transport processes is poorly understood at this point .",
    "we conclude that for modest parameter choices we are unable to produce galaxies that match observed ones .",
    "of course , further combinations of these parameters are possible , however , it is unlikely that self - annihilation is the sole feedback process in galaxy formation .",
    "it is plausible that this process operates in addition to supernovae and agn feedback .",
    "if indeed neutralino self - annihilations contribute to the energetics of feedback in galaxies and clusters as proposed here , we can expect a range of observational signatures .",
    "if the model of annihilation heating developed here operates , we expect the existence of a range of inner dark matter density profile slopes in the centres of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "the time evolution explored in this model suggests that the inner density slopes on the scale of tens of parsecs in galaxies are likely to be diverse .",
    "observationally , this is an extremely challenging length scale to probe and detect this diversity .",
    "studies of the velocity dispersion profiles of the stellar component in the vicinity of the black holes combined with strong lensing offer a potentially viable probe .",
    "mapping of rotation curves has also provided constraints on the density profile of the dark matter in the central regions of galaxies , ( see de blok , mcgaugh & rubin and references therein ) however on much larger scales , of the order of kpc , whereas the dm annihilation scenario leaves an imprint on much smaller scales .",
    "it does appear on that on kpc scales ( larger scales than relevant for dark matter self - annihilations ) there is compelling evidence for bimodality in the distribution of light ( baryons ) .",
    "the nuker group has studied this effect extensively using hubble space telescope data ( gebhardt et al . 1996 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 ; lauer et al .",
    "2002 ) . in a recent paper , combining several hst investigations on the central structure of early - type galaxies they find that the distribution of the logarithmic slopes of the central brightness profiles is bimodal ( lauer et al . 2007 ) .",
    "they claim that at the hst resolution limit , most galaxies are either power - law systems , which have steep cusps in surface brightness , or core systems , which have shallow cusps interior to a steeper envelope in the brightness distribution .",
    "there is a atrong correlation between the luminosity @xmath161 and inner profile slope , and it has been suggested that this correlation is likely due to core formation by binary bhs during mergers ( ferrarese et al .",
    "whether and how this observed bimodality in the surface brightness profiles of the baryonic component reflects the dark matter density profile on the smallest scales is unclear at the present .    the physical scale on which dark matter annihilation manifests itself in the case of clusters",
    "is predicted to be of the order of @xmath91 kpc ( as shown in the bottom right hand panel of figure  3 ) . in this context , we predict that similarly in clusters there ought to be a diversity of density profile slopes on kpc scales . in clusters that have more complex dynamical histories ,",
    "the dark matter spike is likely to have been disrupted progressively due to frequent mergers and these density spikes are also expected to have depleted from the annihilation process itself as a result .",
    "these growing clusters are systems in which the spike reassembly is most unlikely to occur rapidly . in the context of the self - annihilation feedback picture , these clusters are likely to have density profiles with a central plateau ( akin to the evolution shown in figure  1 ) . since clusters are the most recently assembled structures in the universe , we predict a range of inner density slopes in the central few kpc , some shallower than the predictions of dissipationless simulations and some steeper , depending on their dynamical history .",
    "dynamical history coupled with the modification produced due to the presence of the baryonic component ( stars or black holes ) is intricately coupled to the process of dm annihilation as we have shown , and the interplay of these process might dictate the slope of the dark matter density profile in the inner - most regions .",
    "observationally , the issue is once again challenging .",
    "strong lensing studies of the inner regions of clusters with radial and tangential arcs point to the possible existence of shallower density slopes and perhaps cores on scales of @xmath162 kpc .",
    "this is of the order of the scales on which we expect to see signatures of the annihilation process . since strong",
    "lensing constrains the total mass as a function of radius , disentangling the effect of the baryons to infer the density profile of the dark matter alone on these scales is difficult .",
    "the combination of gravitational lensing and dynamical data is uniquely capable of achieving this .",

    "the need for these processes arise from the over - cooling problem that occurs on a range of mass scales , from galaxy groups to clusters ( somerville & primack 1999 ; cole et al . 2001 ; kauffamnn et al . 1999 ; benson et al . 2003 ) .",
    "agn feedback in the quasar mode likely occurs during the epochs of efficient cold gas feeding to the central black holes via a thin accretion disk , at high accretion rates ranging between @xmath166 .",
    "this phase is short - lived and the thermal coupling of agn energy is fairly weak ( at @xmath167 5% level ) . in this mode",
    "the agn - driven wind removes residual gas at the end of the merger , leading to suppression of subsequent star formation and self - regulated bh growth that reproduces the observed @xmath168 relation ( springel et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , for a typical massive galaxy in the local universe a quasar event was long ago in its history .",
    "such galaxies instead host bhs that are accreting at much lower rates ; in fact most spend much of their lifetime in these radiatively inefficient states .",
    "radio activity is associated with these low accretion rate states and radio jets are seen in many massive galaxies .",
    "the coupling of jet energy with host gas can be very efficient and models of effervescent heating with a combination of sound waves , weak shocks and bubbles can heat a large fraction of the gas in clusters ( ruszkowski et al . 2004 ; churazov et al .",

    "a detailed exploration of the theoretical consequences of the steady radio - mode feedback from low luminosity agn has been presented in croton et al .",
    "this was done using the same semi - analytic model used in this paper , but with dm annihilation heating replaced with radio - mode heating .",
    "the authors of croton et al . showed that for a set of energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model could simultaneously explain : ( i ) the low observed mass drop - out rate in cooling flows ; ( ii ) the exponential cut - off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function ; and ( iii ) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge - dominated systems in clusters and found to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies .    in a recent paper best et al .",

    "using observational estimates of the mechanical output of radio jets , they estimate the time - averaged heating rate associated with recurrent radio source activity for all group and cluster galaxies .",
    "they find that within the cooling radius the radio - mode heating associated with galaxy groups and low mass clusters is sufficient to offset the cooling flow from the extended hot halo . in the most massive brightest cluster galaxy systems",
    ", however , radio mode heating alone is not enough .",
    "they conclude that other processes acting in massive clusters must also be contributing to the suppression of cooling flow gas .",
    "importantly for this work , although agn appear to be making an observable contribution to the evolution of gas dynamics in dark matter haloes , alone they only comprise part of the full physical picture .",
    "the presence of smbhs at the centres of massive systems that drive agn winds also provide enhancement in the annihilation rate of dm that , under the right circumstances , can produce sufficient heating flux to arrest cooling gas .",
    "composite dm annihilation and agn heating models will be a natural extension of our work and there is need for all feedback mechanisms to be better understood .",
    "one of the current challenges for all models including the self - annihilation proposed here is developing a better understanding of the micro - physics of how to thermally couple to the gas at all radii where the heating and cooling are required to balance for feedback to be effective .",
    "using the millennium run n - body simulation coupled with a sophisticated model of galaxy formation that includes the heating of cooling flow gas through neutralino annihilation , we have shown that :    * density spikes that support the annihilation flux at the levels required to offset cooling flows are stable enough over long enough time - scales to maintain a reasonably constant heating source ( fig .",
    "[ fig : merger_rate ] ) . *",
    "models that appear to be extreme at the present time ( given our current understanding of dm density profiles ) are required to produce enough heating flux to offset the predicted cooling rates . to obtain the required heating rates we either need to steepen the inner dm density slope to values @xmath169 or increase the outer spike radius .",
    "for galaxy sized haloes the outer spike radius is required to be of the order of @xmath148 , and for cluster haloes @xmath170 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : heating ] and [ fig : lfs1 ] ) . *",
    "the efficiency of heating in the dm annihilation model scales with halo mass ( and circular velocity ) , therefore this mechanism does provide preferential suppression of star formation in more massive haloes as required to explain current observations of the luminosity function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : heating ] ) .    in this treatment",
    ", we have assumed that the mass of central black holes grows significantly at each merger ( as the solution for adiabatic growth in valid only in the limit @xmath171 .",
    "we note here that an alternative source of annihilations may be provided by mini - spikes around inter - mediate mass black holes as suggested by bertone , zentner & silk ( 2005 ) .",
    "it is clear that feedback and energy injected into the inter - stellar medium of galaxies and the intra - cluster medium is a complex process , and that a combination of astrophysical processes , including the one explored here , are likely at play .",
    "one of the key uncertainties in the model explored in this paper arises from the fact that we lack an understanding of the physics through which the annihilation flux is expected to couple with the cooling hot halo gas . while we have discussed some possibilities , like coulomb collisions , brehmstrahlung and synchrotron radiation .",

    "( 2007 ) have explored these in more detail for the case of the heating of gas in the coma cluster due to dm annihilations . experimental confirmation of super - symmetery from the lhc at cern might throw new light on the viability and likely couplings for the neutralino .",
    "additionally while following the cumulative heating history is very challenging to do it is needed to really understand the detailed energetics of the gas .",
    "there is incontrovertible evidence for the presence of copious amounts of dm on all scales in the universe , so dm annihilation is an inescapable phenomenon .",
