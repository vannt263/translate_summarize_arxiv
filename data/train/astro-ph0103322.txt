    "lmc x3 , a bright ( up to 3@xmath010@xmath1 erg  s@xmath2 ) black hole candidate in the large magellanic cloud , is a highly variable x - ray source .",
    "it exhibits at least two distinct emission states . during its more common high / soft state ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum is similar to that of other high / soft state black hole candidates , with an `` ultrasoft '' component and a hard ( @xmath310kev ) tail .",
    "the low / hard state , on the other hand , is characterized by an x - ray spectrum described by a pure power law @xmath4 = @xmath5 with @xmath6@xmath71.8 or less ( wilms et al .",

    "the b3 v optical counterpart of  ( warren and penfold 1975 ) ( v @xmath716.7 - 17.5 ) shows a large velocity range ( semi - amplitude k=235 ) through its 1.7 day orbital period .",
    "the lack of eclipses indicates that the inclination of the system is @xmath870@xmath9 , and this leads to a compact object mass of @xmath77m@xmath10 , making  a prime black hole candidate ( cowley et al .",

    "the optical light curve shows minima at the times of conjunction of the two components , with amplitude @xmath70.2 mag each ; the approximately equal minima of the optical light curve are consistent with an underlying ellipsoidal stellar surface ( van der klis et al .",
    "1985 ) . comparing observations of the source over a long time baseline , it is apparent that the ratio of optical to x - ray flux is not constant .",
    "this may indicate secular variation of the disk structure over a time scale of a week , or a change in anisotropy of the x - ray emission ( treves et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the long - term x - ray luminosity of the system is strongly modulated on time scales of hundreds of days ( cowley et al . 1991 , wilms et al .",
    "the mean 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux varies by a factor of more than one hundred during this long - term cycle .",
    "this variability was previously attributed to the precession of a bright , tilted , and warped accretion disk .",
    "the discovery of recurrent low / hard states in  argues against this mechanism being responsible for the long term variation ( wilms et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "previous x - ray observations have detected no phase - related variability in , and the 1.7-day orbital period is not detected prominently in the rxte asm light curve .",
    "however , the ginga and exosat observations of this source were quite fragmentary  seven observations with durations ranging from 1 to 24  ksec between december 1983 and december 1984 with exosat ( treves et al .  1988 ) , and a series of much shorter exposures spread over three years with ginga ( cowley et al .",
    "prior to the launch of rxte , no intensive study of  sampling an entire binary cycle in a single epoch had ever been performed .",
    "we thus proposed an rxte observation to create a large set of data covering several consecutive orbital cycles with the minimum of interruptions .",
    "we present here the results obtained from this observation , performed in 1998 december , along with a reanalysis of archival data from a shorter dedicated rxte pointing two years earlier .",
    "we also include previously unpublished data from the high speed photometer aboard hubble space telescope ( hst ) , which is to our knowledge the only ultraviolet data on this source covering the 1.7 day binary orbit .",
    "we observed  with rxte ( bradt , rothschild , & swank , 1993 ) between 1998 december 08 17:17 ut  december 15 00:01 ut , for an on - source total good time of 283 kiloseconds .",
    "these observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the data presented here were obtained using the pca instrument in the standard 2 and good xenon data modes , with time resolutions of 16 sec and @xmath11sec respectively .",
    "the pca consists of five xe proportional counter units ( pcus ) , with a combined effective area of about 6500 @xmath12 ( jahoda et al 1996 ) .",
    "only three of the five pcus were on through the entire observation ; we analyzed data only from these three detectors .",
    "spectra and light curves were extracted using the rxte standard data analysis software , ftools 5.0 .",
    "pca background subtraction was performed using the `` l7 - 240 '' ( v19990824/0909 ) faint source model .",
    "is reliably detected above background out to about 18 kev .",
    "response matrices were generated using pcarsp 2.43 in ftools 5.0 , with the latest energy - to - channel relationship .",
    "spectral fitting was performed using xspec 11.0 .",
    "the optical counterpart of the x - ray source   was observed with the polarimetric detector of the high speed photometer ( hsp ) on the hubble space telescope at six different orbital phases during the same binary orbit on 1993 august 24 12:09 ut  august 25 21:53 ut . the observations were obtained in the f277 m bandpass using a 0.65 arcsec diameter aperture .",
    "the fwhm response of the f277 m filter to a flat incident spectrum is 2600 - 2940  .",
    "further details on the instrumental characteristics of the hsp can be found in bless et al .",

    "the polarization in a source was determined from its count rate in four different analyzers , oriented at 0@xmath9 , 45@xmath9 , 90@xmath9 , and 135@xmath9 .",
    "multiple measurements in each orientation analyzer were combined into a single set of count rates using the method recommended by clarke et al .",
    "( 1983 ) . the normalized stokes parameters and their associated uncertainties",
    "were then derived using the procedure outlined by dolan et al .",
    "the magnitude of the polarization and its associated uncertainty were derived from the normalized stokes parameters using the equations given by dolan & tapia ( 1986 ) .",
    "the magnitude of polarization , @xmath13 , was corrected for its non - normal distribution at low statistical significance ( simmons & stewart 1985 ) using the correction factor of wardle & kronberg ( 1974 ) .",
    "flux densities in the f277 m bandpasses were calibrated by observations of bd + 75@xmath9 325 ( bless et al .",
    "1999 ) , an o5p iue spectrophotometric standard . to derive the flux density from the polarimetric observations ,",
    "the count rates used were the average of the summed count rates in the 0@xmath9 and 90@xmath9 orientation analyzers and the summed count rates in the 45@xmath9 and 135@xmath9 pair ( dolan et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "lmc x3 was detected in our hsp observations during one orbital phase at the 80 @xmath14 level of significance in the count rate .",
    "the relatively larger uncertainties on the derived polarizations and the fluxes stated on an absolute scale are caused by photometric variations resulting from small differences in pointing after reacquisition of guide stars , coupled with the spherically aberrated images exceeding the diameter of the observing aperture ( cf .",
    "dolan et al 1994 ) .",
    "the long - term light curve of  as measured by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) aboard rxte is shown in figure 1 , where the four - day average count rate is plotted against julian date .",
    "the long term intensity variation is apparent , and clearly not strictly periodic .",
    "the vertical lines denote the epochs of the pointed pca observations discussed in this paper .",
    "we first turn our attention to the later of these , which began on jd 2451155 , at the moderately faint average asm rate of @xmath15 count s@xmath2 .",
    "our rxte pca light curve of  is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the entire 6.4 day coverage of our observing campaign is shown , along with 1-@xmath14 error bars .",
    "the pca rate in counts s@xmath2 is plotted against time in days ( upper axis ) as well as running binary phase ( lower axis ) .",
    "orbital phase is calculated using the van der klis ( 1985 ) ephemeris , namely t@xmath16 = hjd 2445278.005 + 1.70479 * n. phase zero corresponds to superior conjunction of the x - ray source .",
    "the observations cover the @xmath17 consecutive binary orbits nearly uniformly , with only a few short gaps during this time .",
    "it is apparent in figure 2 that there are two relatively flat stretches where the pca rate stays near @xmath775 count s@xmath2 for about one binary orbit , each of which abruptly ends with a flux decrease of @xmath714% to a rate of @xmath766 count s@xmath2 . at each downward transition ,",
    "the flux moves from the higher rate to the lower rate over a duration of @xmath18 0.42 days .",
    "the one upward and two downward transitions occur at similar binary phases .",
    "the time at which the first downward transition crosses the value of 70 count s@xmath2 is @xmath7mjd 51158.15 , phase 0.19 .",
    "the time at which the upward transition crosses this level ( on its return to the `` nominal '' flux level ) is @xmath7mjd 51159.85 , again binary phase 0.19very nearly one integer binary orbit later . while the coverage gap immediately preceding the second downward transition makes the measured onset time uncertain ( see figure 2 ) , we estimate it begins at or before @xmath7mjd 51161.74 , phase @xmath18 0.29 . in other words , the cycle from one downward transition to the next repeats at very nearly the orbital period .",
    "this is interesting , for it implies that the mechanism giving rise to the abrupt flux transitions is dynamically linked to the orbit .",
    "we searched for evidence of x - ray modulation at the orbital period by dividing the data into two groups based on source counting rate .",
    "data with a rate below 70 c / s were folded on the orbital period separately from those points with rate above 70 c / s , thus preventing the gross flux transitions discussed above from contaminating the folded light curves .",
    "( taking the data set as a whole and folding on the orbital period would result in data from higher and lower gross flux segments being averaged together in a single phase bin , which masks the lower - amplitude phase modulation . )",
    "figure 3 shows the results of folding each of these data sets on the orbital period of the van der klis ( 1985 ) ephemeris .",
    "the orbital modulation is clear in the low - flux data ( fig .",
    "3a)it reaches a maximum slightly beyond @xmath19 while the minimum occurs near @xmath20 . folding the high - flux data ( fig .",
    "3b ) at the orbital period shows apparently weaker phase modulation .    to further investigate the presence of phase dependent flux variability , we performed periodogram analysis on the data set as a whole , binned at 800 s , and the phase - selected subsets defined above .",
    "we restricted the period search to within 0.5 days of the observed optical orbital period .",
    "significance was estimated using the the false - alarm probability defined by scargle ( 1982 ) .",
    "the best - fit trial period of the low - flux data is 1.693@xmath210.037 d , with a false - alarm probability of 2.4@xmath010@xmath22 for a @xmath3 7@xmath14 detection .",
    "the best - fit trial period for the high - flux data is 1.712@xmath210.037 d , with false alarm probability of 4.5@xmath010@xmath23 for a @xmath3 6@xmath14 detection .",
    "each detection is significant and consistent with the observed orbital period in the optical .",
    "we conclude that significant periodic amplitude modulation is present in the x - ray flux from lmc x3 , and that the amplitude of the modulation is slightly higher when the 2 - 10 kev flux is lower .",
    "this is the first reported detection of orbital phase dependence in the x - ray intensity from lmc x3 .",
    "nowak et al . ( 2000 ) discuss a previous 140 ks rxte observation of lmc x3 obtained on 1996 november 30  december 6 , when the source was at the relatively high rxte / asm count rate of about 3.5 count s@xmath2 .",
    "their light curve ( figure 1 of nowak et al .",
    "2000 ) shows similar qualitative behavior : a slow flux transition from higher rate to lower rate in the 2 - 10 kev flux with an overall amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "motivated by the detection of strong phase dependence in  at relatively low flux levels , we extracted this archival data set to search for orbital modulation at a significantly different flux level and epoch . since different detectors were on / off through this observation , we scaled the lightcurve to the 5-pcu rate . again , due to the overall gross flux transition present during this long observation , we grouped their data into two segments , selected by total pca rate ( above / below 410 count s@xmath2 ) , before folding on the van der klis ( 1985 ) ephemeris .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented in figure 4 .",
    "phase dependence is clearly present in both groups of data .",
    "the phase coverage of the observation when the source was at slightly greater flux levels is insufficient to trace out an entire cycle ; only orbital phase @xmath25 = 0.0 - 0.5 was observed . at the lower count rate ,",
    "the phase coverage is sufficient to trace out a light curve qualitatively similar to that seen in the low flux 1998 december data . as in the 1998 december observation ,",
    "it is single - peaked ; the maximum x - ray intensity occurs near @xmath26 while the minimum is near @xmath20 . as in the 1998 december data ,",
    "the amplitude of this modulation is @xmath27 .",
    "we searched for rapid aperiodic variability in  using the high time resolution pca data obtained in the good xenon mode .",
    "discrete power spectral density distributions ( psds ) were calculated by dividing the data into segments of uniform length , performing fast fourier transforms of each , and averaging the results .",
    "the psds were normalized such that their integral gives the squared rms fractional variability ( miyamoto et al 1991 ; van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "we subtracted the poisson noise level from the power spectra , taking into account the modifications expected from pca detector deadtime . in",
    "its low / hard state , lmc x-3 displays quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) at a centroid frequency of 0.4 hz , and significant time variability of 3050% ( boyd et al .",
    "neither are detected in this observation , and the long duration of this data set allows us to place a rather stringent upper limit of 1% on the rms amplitude of a qpo feature between 0.110  hz .",
    "our analysis of the time variability in lmc x-3 indicates that the light curve shown in figure 2 can be described as the superposition of 1 ) an orbital modulation of roughly constant amplitude and 2 ) abrupt flux transitions recurring at twice the orbital period .",
    "significant orbital modulation is also present in archival data ( figure 4 ) taken when lmc x-3 was at a dramatically different flux level , implying that orbital modulation is a reliable feature in the x - ray output through a fourfold range of source intensities .",
    "the 1996 december archival observation also contains one gross flux transition , though the data set is not long enough to determine whether it repeats , and if so , at what period .",
    "the amplitude of the orbital modulation in the 1996 december observation is approximately 5% , as in the 1998 december data .",
    "orbital modulation of the x - ray flux has not been previously observed in , although it is a well - known feature of the optical light curve . in the v - band , the ellipsoidal deformation of the b - star results in the double - peaked morphology of the light curve . in an effort to extend our knowledge of the orbital modulation of  as a function of photon energy",
    ", we present the results of an ultraviolet photometric and polarimetric study of  using the high speed photometer aboard the hubble space telescope .",
    "in figure 5 we compare the orbital light curve we obtained in the f277 m bandpass in 1993 with the v band light curve obtained in 1984 by van paradijs et al .",
    "while the phase coverage of the uv light curve is sparse , the overall variation is not inconsistent with the double - peaked optical light curve .",
    "the uv light curve is also consistent with an additional source of uv radiation in the system , with maximum occurring near inferior conjunction of the x - ray source .",
    "this second light would presumably be coming from the accretion disk .",
    "no linear polarization was detected at any orbital phase ( see table 2 ) .",
    "assuming constant polarization from lmc x3 in the f277 m bandpass , and treating the normalized stokes parameters as normally distributed ( but cf .",
    "clarke et al .",
    "1983 ) , the 2 @xmath14 upper limit on the linear polarization of lmc x3 in the f277 m bandpass is p @xmath18 0.018 .",
    "several other x - ray binary systems , notably cygnus x-1 , do show significant phase - dependent polarization in the uv , interpreted as evidence for single scattering off gas streams connecting the primary to the accretion disk ( dolan & tapia 1988 , wolinski et al .",
    "the upper limit on any variable polarization is too large to contain any information about the structure of the gas streams in the system .",
    "there is no single accepted model for the spectral variability of galactic black hole candidates across their several spectral states ( see reviews by tanaka & lewin 1995 , nowak 1995 , van der klis 1995 , for discussions of black hole spectral states ) .",
    "numerous authors choose a phenomenological `` disk black body plus power law '' model , in which the spectrum is fit by the superposition of multiple rings of black bodies representing the cooler accretion disk , plus a power law to describe the hard photons . while not motivated by a clear physical picture of what gives rise to these independent components , this model does give reasonable results for spectral fits ( though commonly a `` feature '' is seen at the cross - over point of the two functions ) .",
    "alternative models based on a physical description of the interaction of a spherical comptonizing corona and cooler seed photons from the disk ( shrader & titarchuk 1999 , borozdin et al . , 1999 ) are often only applicable in restricted spectral states , or produce biased residuals at high energies . because previous spectral studies of  have concentrated on the phenomenological `` disk black body plus power law '' model ( wilms et al .",
    "2000 , nowak et al .",
    "2000 , also ebisawa , cowley ) , and because of the ambiguity in the spectral state of at this relatively low flux level , we have chosen to report our spectral fitting results using this model . in the following discussion ,",
    "model parameters for the powerlaw component are photon index @xmath6 and @xmath28 in photons kev@xmath2 @xmath29 s@xmath2",
    ". the disk black body model is parameterized by @xmath30 , the temperature ( kt ) at the inner edge of the accretion disk , as well as a geometric factor @xmath31 which depends on the inner disk radius , the viewing angle of the accretion disk , and the distance to the source .",
    "wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report recurrent low / hard states in lmc x3 based on long - term monitoring with rxte over several years .",
    "this was confirmed by more recent rxte observations during a low / hard state ( boyd et al .",
    "2000 ) in which both the timing and spectral characteristics of black hole candidates in the low / hard state was observed .",
    "wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report a disk temperature that drops below 1.0 kev as the source enters the low state .",
    "the source is well described by a pure power law with @xmath32 when truly in the low state .",
    "in our investigation of the spectral changes during our observation , we restrict ourselves to data obtained far from saa passage and with low measured electron contamination .",
    "we only consider observations where the orbital phase was between 0.475 to 0.525 in an attempt to minimize orbital effects when comparing the higher flux and lower flux spectra .",
    "our spectral fits include data from 2.5 - 25.0 kev .",
    "the power law plus black - body disk model was found to be acceptable under the @xmath33 test for each individual spectrum , with typical reduced @xmath33 values near or below 1.0 for 49 degrees of freedom .",
    "results of spectral fits to the @xmath20 observations are summarized in table 3 .",
    "a typical two - component model fit is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the disk temperature hovers near the critical value of @xmath34 reported by wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as an indicator of the occurrence of a transition from the high / soft to the low / hard state . unlike the pure low / hard state however",
    ", a significant disk component is required to achieve a reasonable spectral fit to the current observations .",
    "this may indicate that  was undergoing a state transition at the time .",
    "the model flux reported in table 3 is about 15 times greater than the flux measured during the 2000 may low / hard state ( boyd et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the disk black body spectral components show a roughly linear trend with the 2 - 10 kev flux .",
    "the changes in @xmath30 are small , and within the formal uncertainties on this parameter . on the other hand",
    ", the disk normalization parameter @xmath31 varies by @xmath35 from minimum to maximum flux .",
    "since @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath36cos@xmath37 this implies either a change in the inner accretion disk radius , or the inclination of the disk , is responsible for the gross flux variation from one cycle to the next .",
    "a global warp or kink , traveling around the disk , could cause the effective inclination of the disk to vary from one binary cycle to the next .",
    "nowak et al . ( 2000 ) point out that , during the long observation in 1996 december , variations in the disk black body spectral components run counter to previously observed long term trends , wherein the normalization term remains fairly constant while the disk temperature exhibits marked variability with observed flux .",
    "our results of the 1998 december observations follow the short time scale trend found by nowak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) where the disk black body temperature is relatively constrained and variability is instead correlated to the geometric normalization parameter .",
    "our rxte observations of  through 3.5 consecutive binary cycles have detected significant orbital phase modulation of the 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux .",
    "the amplitude of the orbital modulation is variable , being higher when the the system experienced an abrupt decrease in flux .",
    "comparison of our results to an archival observation at a profoundly different flux level shows that phase - dependent flux is a hallmark of  through a wide range of overall x - ray intensities , with an amplitude of between 510% . the uv light curve , while sparse , is consistent in shape with the optical variability , implying that the dominant component of the uv radiation is the deformed main sequence star and outer disk , as in the optical .    a phase - dependent x - ray flux may be due to a ) a compact `` hot spot '' of x - ray generation moving into and out of our line of sight , b ) a region of cooler absorbing matter moving into and out of our line of sight , or c ) a combination of the two . since  does not display eclipses of the compact object , its inclination is not well constrained . a possible geometric model that explains the variation seen at the different flux levels is that of a hot spot located between the main sequence star and the compact object , perhaps where the stream impacts the accretion disk .",
    "x - rays from this hot spot could be absorbed by the accretion disk at inferior conjunction of the x - ray source ( @xmath38 ) but be visible to the observer at superior conjunction ( @xmath39 )",
    ". the expected curvature of the gas stream would give rise to the flux maximum occurring slightly after superior conjunction .",
    "changes in the location of the gas stream as a function of mass accretion rate could account for the slightly different phase of maximum during the high state 1996 observations .",
    "an equally striking feature of our rxte light curve is the abrupt flux decreases , separated by very nearly two binary periods .",
    "the slower return to the higher flux level also occurs near similar binary phase .",
    "one possible model for the system that explains both the overall flux transitions and the variable orbital phase modulation is that of a disk excited into a low - order global mode .",
    "global instabilities in highly ionized accretion disks around compact objects are not sufficiently well understood to claim that this model is realistic or expected .",
    "however , there is growing numerical and observational evidence that suggests similar global structures in accretion disks do develop and persist .",
    "such a large - scale perturbation of the accretion disk provides a global mechanism for angular momentum transport and dispersion which , together with the local viscous processes , can drive the dynamics of the disk .",
    "evidence for significant two - armed spiral structure has been seen in doppler tomography studies of the dwarf nova ip pegasi during two outbursts ( steeghs , 2000 ) .",
    "three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of accretion disks show that the formation of spiral shocks is common over a wide range of system parameters , including disk temperatures much hotter than those in dwarf novae ( boffin et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we suggest the presence of a global density wave in the accretion disk of as one possible explanation that is consistent with the data .",
    "if such a global feature were stable for several binary orbits , and rotated with an angular velocity close to one quarter the orbital velocity , then the gross features in the x - ray light curve would be reproduced due to the varying obscuration along the line of sight . as the feature rotated around the disk it would at times obscure observed x - rays in a phase - dependent fashion , and at other times have little appreciable effect on the observed x - ray flux .",
    "this concept is illustrated schematically in figure 7 , where we represent the global mode as a spiral density wave .",
    "we do not rule out other combinations of disk and orbital  geometry that may explain the observed behavior .",
    "we note , however , that the spiral structure seen in ip peg , as well as large scale disc asymmetries in other systems , have been observed to co - rotate with the binary system .",
    "the long term variability of  is not easily characterized .",
    "it is becoming clear that the previous conjecture of periodic large amplitude flux variations arising from a warped precessing disk is not complete : the large scale variation seen in the rxte asm ( figure 1 ) is far from simply periodic .",
    "if instead its long term behavior is similar to cygnus x-1 and other persistent galactic black hole candidates , then  stands out due to the suggestion of a preferred time scale : on the order of hundreds of days from one low / hard state to the next .",
    "if a global disk instability is responsible for state transitions in such systems then the disk dynamics in  must be quite different from the persistent galactic black holes , which apparently undergo the transition in a more random fashion .",
    "it is possible that does not fit neatly into either category above , but has characteristics of each . in that case , continued intensive studies of the system should be carried out with the goal of developing a consistent physical model of the accretion disk structure and dynamics .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center .",
