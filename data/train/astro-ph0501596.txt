    "<S> the cosmological dynamics of minimally coupled scalar field that couple to the background matter with thermal interactions is investigated in exponential potential . the conditions for the existence and stability of various critical points as well as their cosmological implications are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> although we show that the effects of thermal interaction such as depressing the equation - of - state parameter of quintessence , is only important at the early time , the evolution of equation - of - state parameter of quintessence is manifested . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound is required on the coupling between quintessence and relativistic relic particles such as photons and neutrinos .    </S>",
    "<S> astronomical measurements from supernovae ia @xcite , galaxies clustering , for example , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and anisotropies of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite independently suggest that a large fraction of the energy density of our universe is so - called dark energy , which has negative pressure , or equation of state with @xmath0 , and accelerates the expansion of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the dark energy remains elusive from the point of view of general relativity and standard particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> one candidate source of this missing energy component is a slowly evolving and spatially homogeneous scalar field , referred to as `` quintessence '' with @xmath1 @xcite and `` phantom '' with @xmath2 @xcite respectively . since current observational constraint on the equation of state of the dark energy lies in the range @xmath3 @xcite , it is still too early to rule out any of the above candidates . to study the global property of the cosmological system containing dark energy , phase space analysis is proved to be a powerful tool .    because dark energy redshifts more slowly than ordinary matter or radiation , there exists an important problem that various proposals of the dark energy should explain , that is , why the energy density of matter and dark energy should be comparable at the present epoch . </S>",
    "<S> a form of quintessence called `` tracker fields '' , whose evolution is largely insensitive to initial conditions and at late times begin to dominate the universe with a negative equation of state , was introduced to avoids the above problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another approach to solve the puzzle is introducing an interaction term in the equations of motion , which describes the energy flow between the dark energy and the rest matter ( mainly the dark matter ) in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that , with the help of a suitable coupling , it is possible to reproduce any scaling solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> the effects of thermal coupling between the quintessence field and the ordinary matter particles has been investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hsu and murray set the quintessence field to be a static external source for a euclidean path integral depicting the thermal degree of freedom and let the time - like boundary conditions of the path integral have a period which is decided by the inverse of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> they show that if in the early universe matter particles are in thermal equilibrium , quantum gravity @xcite will induce an effective thermal mass term for quintessence field @xmath4 , which takes the form @xmath5 where @xmath6{\\rho_{r0}}/a$ ] is the temperature of the universe , @xmath7 the planck mass scale , @xmath8 a dimensionless constant , @xmath9 the scale factor ( with current value @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 the energy density of radiation at the present epoch , and find that even planck - suppressed interactions between matter and the quintessence field can alter its evolution qualitatively . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> hsu and murray @xcite use an approximation that the back reaction on matter of quintessence is neglectable . </S>",
    "<S> however , this back - reaction effect , in fact , is significant both at the early time and late time . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the dynamics of the cosmology with quintessence using the phase space analysis , which has the above thermal coupling to the matter in a complete manner . </S>",
    "<S> we shall seek the conditions for the existence and stability of various critical points as well as their cosmological implications . </S>",
    "<S> as will be shown in this paper , although the effects of thermal interaction , such as depressing the equation - of - state parameter of quintessence , is only important at the early time , the evolution of equation - of - state parameter of quintessence is manifested . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound is required on the coupling between quintessence and relativistic relic particles such as photons and neutrinos .    </S>",
    "<S> we first study the phase space of quintessence with a thermal coupling to ordinary matter particles in spatially flat frw cosmological background @xmath12 for the spatially homogeneous scalar field minimally coupled to gravity with thermal interaction ( [ eq1 ] ) , the evolution is governed by the klein - gordon equation @xmath13 where the overdots denote the derivative with respect to cosmic time and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath4 . here </S>",
    "<S> the hubble parameter @xmath14 is determined by the friedmann equation @xmath15\\ ] ] and @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the energy density and pressure of the barotropic matter . according to eqs.([ddphi])-([dh ] ) and the conservation of energy , @xmath18 satisfies the following continuous equation @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a constant , @xmath23 , such as radiation(@xmath24 ) or dust ( @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that when the thermal coupling parameter @xmath8 becomes zero , the equations ( [ ddphi])-([sys1 ] ) will return to those of the standard one scalar field quintessence scenario . </S>",
    "<S> in current situation , both quintessence and barotropic matter are not conserved , but the overall energy is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density ratio of quintessence and barotropic matter satisfies the following conditions @xmath26 where the parameter @xmath27 , @xmath28 , in which @xmath29 is the so - called parameter of state of quintessence which is defined by @xmath30 , and @xmath31 @xmath32    rewriting the equations ( [ ddphi ] ) and ( [ sys1 ] ) , we have @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> now , introducing the following variables : @xmath37 the equation system([ddphi])-([sys1 ] ) becomes the following system : @xmath38-(3x+\\beta^2z^2\\xi-\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda y^2),\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dy}{dn}&=&\\frac{3}{2}y[\\gamma(1-x^2-y^2)+2x^2]-\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda xy,\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dz}{dn}&=&\\frac{3}{2}z[\\gamma(1-x^2-y^2)+2x^2]-2z+xz\\xi,\\\\ \\frac{d\\xi}{dn}&=&-x\\xi^2,\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{d\\lambda}{dn } & = & -x\\lambda^2(\\gamma-1 ) . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy density parameter and the equation - of - state parameter of quintessence , @xmath39 and @xmath29 , satisfy the constraint equation @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since the energy density of the barotropic fluid @xmath18 is semi - positive - definite , any cosmological model can be represented as a trajectory in the phase space that is bounded within the unit disc , i.e. @xmath42 . from the definitions of these new variables , it is not difficult to reduce the effective parameter of state of quintessence to @xmath43    to be concrete , we consider the quintessence with an exponential potential energy density , i.e. , @xmath44 where the parameter @xmath45 and @xmath46 are two constants . </S>",
    "<S> exponential potentials have been studied extensively in various situations , and these are of interest for two main reasons . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , they can be derived from a good candidate of fundamental theory for such being string / m - theory ; secondly , the motion equations can be written as an autonomous system in the situation . </S>",
    "<S> the author of an earlier work @xcite considered a scalar field with a single exponential potential in a homogeneous and isotropic universe . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , it was extended to include barotropic matter @xcite and multiple scalar fields @xcite , and generalized for anisotropic universe @xcite . according to the definitions , the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 both become constants and are equal to @xmath46 and @xmath49 , respectively . under the circumstance , the equations ( [ auto1 ] ) constitute an autonomous system as follows , @xmath50-(3x+\\beta^2z^2\\xi-\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_0 y^2),\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dy}{dn}&=&\\frac{3}{2}y[\\gamma(1-x^2-y^2)+2x^2]-\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_0 xy,\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dz}{dn}&=&\\frac{3}{2}z[\\gamma(1-x^2-y^2)+2x^2]-2z+xz\\xi,\\\\ \\frac{d\\xi}{dn}&=&-x\\xi^2.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the equation of state of matter ( [ sys1 ] ) and eqs . ( [ defx])-([defxi ] ) , we obtain that @xmath51 where we have chosen the exponential potential ( [ potential1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 can be directly expressed as @xmath52 where the parameter @xmath53 is the present value of energy density of matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to find that in the case of @xmath54 , the energy density of matter will evolve in the manner of @xmath55 for @xmath56 as usual .    </S>",
    "<S> when barotropic matter is under consideration and/or the equations of motion are too difficult to solve analytically , phase space methods become particularly useful , because numerical solutions with random initial conditions usually do not expose all the interesting properties . in table </S>",
    "<S> [ table1 ] , we list the critical points , conditions for their existence and the cosmological parameters there .    to investigate the stability of these critical points , we can write the variables near these points ( @xmath57,@xmath58,@xmath59,@xmath60 ) in the form @xmath61,@xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath65,@xmath66 , the perturbations of the variables about the critical points to the first order . this leads to the equation of motion , @xmath67 where the 4-column vector @xmath68 , @xmath69 represents the perturbations of the variables and @xmath70 is a constant @xmath71 matrix . for stability </S>",
    "<S> we require the all 4 eigenvalues of @xmath70 to be negative . for the critical points listed in table 1 , we find the eigenvalues of the linear perturbation matrix for different stable critical points , see table [ table2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> critical points of type a correspond to the scalar field dominated solutions ( @xmath72 ) , which exist for sufficiently flat potentials , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for the barotropic index @xmath74 , they are stable to the extent that this kind of solutions represent late - time attractors in the presence of a barotropic fluid . </S>",
    "<S> note that type e is a special case of type a , i.e. , @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> critical points of type b correspond to another kind of late - time attractor where neither the quintessence field nor the barotropic fluid completely dominates the evolution of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> they are known as scaling solutions where the energy density of quintessence is proportionated to that of barotropic fluid at late time with @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the barotropic index @xmath22 is required to be no more than @xmath77 for the sake of stability .    </S>",
    "<S> critical points of type c denote the barotropic fluid dominated solutions where @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> they are unstable for all reasonable values of @xmath22 and @xmath47 ( i.e. however steep the potential ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ones of type d are the so - called kinetic - dominated solutions where the late - time evolution of the universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of quintessence with a stiff equation of state , i.e. @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are unstable as one expects .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown in table [ table1 ] , all the critical points exist when and only when @xmath80 , that is to say that @xmath8 does not appear in the final expressions that determine the critical points . </S>",
    "<S> this means that with the evolution of the universe the thermal coupling ( [ eq1 ] ) between the quintessence and matter always goes asymptotically to vanish away . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig1 ] shows a scaling solution that the quintessence goes towards an attractor .    in the above </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the phase space of scalar field with thermal interactions to cosmic matter in a flat frw cosmological background . </S>",
    "<S> the critical points indicate that these stable attractor phases corresponding to the vanishing of the thermal interaction between the quintessence and the barotropic matter . </S>",
    "<S> however , what will be the effects of the thermal interactions in the circumstances ? </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the introduction of the interacting term will change the evolutionary tracks of the dynamical systems , which was not well manifested by the above qualitative analysis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we study their dynamical evolution numerically and compare the results with the cases of no coupling quintessence scenario . in fig.[fig4 ] , the evolution of equation - of - state parameter of quintessence is manifested . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the effective equation - of - state parameter of quintessence @xmath81 that incorporate the effect of the thermal coupling between quintessence and matter is smaller than that of quintessence without coupling to the background matter .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the cosmological dynamics of scalar field , quintessence , that couple to the background matter with thermal interactions in exponential potential . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions for the existence and stability of various critical points are obtained by phase space analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that incorporating the effect of thermal coupling between the quintessence and background matter does not qualitatively alter the late - time evolution of the components in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> just as the ordinary situation that there is no direct coupling between quintessence and background barotropic matter @xcite , for the parameters @xmath82 , the universe is dominated by quintessence at late time ; and for @xmath83 , quintessence does not entirely dominate the universe but remains a fixed fraction of the total matter at late time . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also find that the effects of thermal interaction make the equation - of - state parameter of quintessence become lower than the one in the standard quintessence scenario of dark energy at the early time and depress the energy density of matter simultaneously , see fig.[fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , large coupling to relic particles such as neutrinos can be ruled out as they lead to a problematic equation - of - state parameter , which is consistent with ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath4 is probably close to the planck energy suggests that more interactions should figure in to the behavior of quintessence . </S>",
    "<S> however , this will possibly lead to a relic density problem at nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is worth emphasizing that this thermal interaction may be helpful to understand the coincidence of @xmath84 . </S>"
