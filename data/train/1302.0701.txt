    "away from the strong coupling limit @xmath133 , where interactions between symmetric and ( gapped ) antisymmetric sector drive the system towards phase separation , the bosonized hamiltonian @xmath26 can be effectively split into two distinct sectors . the symmetric one is described by a tomonaga - luttinger liquid , whereas the antisymmetric one by a sine - gordon hamiltonian with  the mass - term for the phase field @xmath134 . in particular , at the luther - emery point @xmath135 , it is possible to map the antisymmetric sector to the so called massive dirac hamiltonian @xcite @xmath136 by employing standard re - fermionization techniques @xcite . here",

    "the mapping to eq .",
    "is possible due to the specific form of the interaction in the sine - gordon hamiltonian involving phase fluctuations @xmath134 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian corresponds to the continuum limit of the kitaev chain  @xcite , and , therefore , supports majorana edge states . since the antisymmetric and symmetric sectors are decoupled , the energy splitting between the two degenerate ground states is exponentially small in the system size @xcite .",
    "however , certain external perturbations , such as interchain backscattering ( in the presence of interactions between the wires ) or impurities , may change the dependence of the energy splitting on the system size from exponential to algebraic ( although with an extremely small prefactor in the vicinity of the luther - emery point , see the detailed instanton discussion in ref .",
    "in this and the following section , we describe two possible implementation schemes realizing the pair hopping hamiltonian discussed in the main text .      before discussing the two couple wires and pair hopping between these wires",
    "we briefly describe our setup for a single wire .",
    "we implement the single wire of spinless fermions as a bipartite lattice of spinful fermions in an 1d - optical lattice as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model2]a . odd and even lattice sites @xmath92 trap @xmath2 and @xmath3 components of fermionic atoms , respectively , and transitions between adjacent wells ( and the associated spin flip ) are induced either by an rf field or by an optical raman transition .  the corresponding hamiltonian is@xmath142 with @xmath143 the energies of the atomic states representing the spins , @xmath4 the rabi frequency of the raman drive and @xmath144 the corresponding frequency .",
    "after a transformation to a  `` rotating frame '' the above hamiltonian can be rewritten with the mapping @xmath145 ( @xmath92 even ) and @xmath146 ( @xmath92 odd ) as@xmath147 here @xmath148 is the detuning , which acts as an offset ( superlattice ) for the odd lattice sites . the tunneling amplitude in the lattice can be identified with the rabi frequency of the drive , @xmath149 .",
    "note that the above hamiltonian corresponds to an effective model of spinless fermions hopping on a 1d lattice .",
    "the above realization of a 1d wire of spinless fermionic atoms acts as a building block for two coupled wires ( with a straightforward generalization to many coupled wires ) .",
    "the setup we have in mind is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model2]b with the wires denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in addition we introduce auxiliary sites between the wires , which we call center or molecular sites in fig .",
    "[ fig : model2]b .",
    "they are the basic ingredient in implementing pair hopping , while strongly suppressing unwanted processes like single particle tunneling ( which violates parity of atoms on the two wires ) .",
    "we extend the single wire model of the previous subsection assuming that the spins are placed in a spatially varying magnetic field with gradient perpendicular to the wires .",
    "this results in a spin dependent energy offset : the spins @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the ( upper ) @xmath7 wire have zeeman energies @xmath150 and @xmath151 , and the corresponding energies on the ( lower ) wire @xmath1 are @xmath151 and @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "thus we have the following hamiltonians for the two ( uncoupled ) wires : @xmath152 if we choose @xmath153 , our model reduces again to a 1d tight binding model for spinless fermions hopping on the wires , as discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the zeeman offsets will play a central role in the following discussion of pair hopping .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model2]b , atoms can hop from the two wires to ( auxiliary ) central sites , which can be occupied by both @xmath2 and @xmath3 atoms .",

    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath155    here @xmath156 and @xmath157 are hamiltonians for the wire as discussed above .",
    "the hamiltonian for the central sites @xmath158 is @xmath159 where we adopt the notation @xmath160 for @xmath158 on the link @xmath161 , and we have an interaction term @xmath8 between atoms with different spin in the center of the plaquette .",
    "the last line is a spin - preserving hopping from the wires to the central site .    finally , @xmath162 accounts for rf or raman induced spin - flip transitions , @xmath163 the first line is a spin - flip at the central site , and the last lines account for an rf or raman assisted hopping from the wire to the central site .",
    "note that - in contrast to the rf or raman couplings along the wires - all these terms are off - resonant because the drive frequency @xmath164 is detuned from from the corresponding transition frequencies @xmath165 .",
    "thus these terms average to zero , provided @xmath166 .",
    "we will neglect them in the following discussion .    to illustrate the physics of pair hopping we consider now a single plaquette @xmath167 ( dotted box in fig .  [",
    "fig : model2]b ) .",
    "we can write the corresponding hamiltonian in a frame rotating with @xmath144 as @xmath168 for the sites on the two wires we have again used the notation @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , @xmath172 .",
    "the first line is again the raman or rf hopping between sites @xmath173 with energies @xmath151 and @xmath174 , respectively , due to absorption ( emission ) of a photon @xmath153 , which is tuned to compensate the energy difference .",
    "the second line corresponds to the central site with interaction and hopping .",
    "the last two lines describe a spin - flip on site @xmath158 , and a raman assisted hopping and accompanying spin flip from the wires to the central site @xmath158 .",
    "let us now analyze the various processes on the plaquette according to the above hamiltonian .",
    "we will argue that an adiabatic elimination of the central site will result in an effective hamiltonian for the two wires where single particle tunneling is suppressed , while atoms can hop pairwise between the wires .",

    "this tunneling process is not energy conserving and thus will occur only as virtual process , which renormalizes the ( single particle ) tunneling parameters and onsite shifts of the wire sites . * _ interwire pair hopping .",
    "_ while the single particle interwire hops @xmath177 and @xmath178 are individually forbidden , the joint hopping is energetically allowed . for this pair hopping to happen the two particles must occupy simultaneously the central site to be able to exchange energy , i.e. to interact .",
    "an adiabatic elimination of the central site therefore gives a term @xmath179 , where in the limit of large @xmath8@xmath180 + particle assisted tunneling , where , for example , a particle hops @xmath181 while a second particle @xmath182 remains on wire @xmath7 , is suppressed by energy conservation .",
    "a process @xmath181 while @xmath183 requires a spinflip on the central site which we argued to be small ; in addition this process can be suppressed by tilting the plaquette . *",
    "_ parity - preserving perturbations .",

    "the occupation of the central sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_conservation]b ) is very small .      as a final remark",
    "we will relate the present model to the one described in the following subsection , where the role of tunneling and raman beams is interchanged .",
    "we can make a time - dependent transformation to rewrite the above plaquette hamiltonian as @xmath201 the first line now looks like a tunneling hamiltonian , while the last two lines correspond to time - dependent hoppings to the central site with frequencies @xmath202 . in this rewriting of the model",
    "the lattice offsets have been converted to effective time - dependent rf or raman couplings . in the following section we investigate a model , which is a generalization of this scheme .",

    ", we show how one can couple one of the wires to the intermediate sites such that pair tunneling from the wire to the middle sites is generated in second order perturbation theory .",
    "this discussion will then be naturally extended to the full plaquette treatment , where the emergence of inter - wire pair tunneling will emerge as a combination of a pair tunneling process from the @xmath7-wire to the central sites , and from the central sites to the @xmath1-wire .",

    "this is due to the fact that , for a short - range interparticle interaction , one has to use spatially inhomogeneous rabi frequencies in order to change the symmetry of the spatial part of the wave function for two particles from antisymmetric ( for two initial particle on one of the wires ) to symmetric ( for two particles in the center of a plaquette ) .    in a similar way ,",
