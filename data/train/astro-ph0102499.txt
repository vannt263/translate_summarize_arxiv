    "with increasing redshift , optical and x - ray survey techniques for finding galaxy clusters lose their effectiveness and a targeted approach is warranted .",
    "in particular , radio galaxies can be used as cluster signposts .",
    "dickinson ( 1996 ) has identified clusters around powerful 3c sources at redshifts greater than 1.2 , and deltorn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) discovered a cluster of galaxies around 3cr 184 at @xmath3 .",
    "clusters of varying richness have also been seen around the radio galaxies studied by hill & lilly ( 1991  hereafter h&l91 ) and by zirbel ( 1997  hereafter z97 ) , among others .",
    "however , some kinds of radio galaxies are more often associated with clusters than others , and are therefore more efficient tracers of these high - density environments .    over two decades ago , fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) discovered a correlation between the power of an extended radio source and its morphology , and divided all such sources into two classes .",
    "fr i radio galaxies typically have powers less than @xmath4 at 1440 mhz ( assuming a power law spectrum with @xmath5 ) , bright radio cores , and lobes fading toward the edges .",
    "fr ii s have @xmath6 with dim or absent cores and edge - brightened lobes .",
    "more recent work has shown that the dividing line in power between fr i s and ii s is a function of optical luminosity ( ledlow & owen 1996 ; owen & white 1991 ) .",
    "fr i and ii radio sources are associated with host galaxies located in different environments on the megaparsec scale ( h&l91 ; z97 ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies with a wide range of optical magnitudes can play host to both fr i and ii sources ( ledlow & owen 1995a ; ledlow , owen , & eilek 2000 ) .",
    "the more powerful fr i galaxies ( those near the fr i / ii break such as the wide - angle and narrow - angle tail sources discussed below ) are often associated with cd or d galaxies found in rich groups or clusters at all redshifts up to z @xmath7 0.5 , the limit of current studies .",
    "fr ii sources are usually found in poor groups at low - z , although at higher redshifts ( @xmath8 ) , groups surrounding fr ii s appear to be richer by a factor of @xmath9 .",
    "the hosts of some fr ii s are quasars .",
    "a source s radio morphology may become distorted as a consequence of the relative motion between the host galaxy and the surrounding intracluster medium ( icm ) or via interaction with a neighboring galaxy .",
    "common distortions in fr i sources include wide - angle tail ( wat ) and narrow - angle tail ( nat ) morphologies which have large and small opening angles , respectively .",
    "the classical explanation for the bending of the lobes is the ram pressure exerted by the icm as a galaxy with a significant peculiar velocity moves through a cluster ( owen & rudnick 1976 ) .",
    "an alternate explanation ( burns et al . 1996 ;",
    "roettiger , burns , & loken 1996 ; burns et al .",
    "1993 ) has the icm in motion rather than the galaxy , since wats are often associated with cd galaxies which have small peculiar velocities relative to the immediately surrounding cluster . in this scenario ,",
    "the icm is set in motion by the merging of clusters or smaller sub - clumps ; evidence for this view is found in the alignment of x - ray emission contours with the bending of the lobes ( gmez et al .",
    "fr ii sources may also become distorted ; sometimes the distortions appear symmetric and may result from icm interaction , whereas at other times the sources have an asymmetric appearance most likely caused by interaction with a neighboring galaxy ( rector , stocke , & ellingson 1995 ) .",
    "a vla survey of nearby abell clusters ( zhao et al . 1989 ; ledlow & owen 1995a , 1995b , 1996 ) found that 95% of the radio sources in the clusters were type fr i. in a radio continuum survey of distant ( @xmath10 ) x - ray - selected clusters from the @xmath11 medium sensitivity survey , stocke et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that @xmath12 cluster radio sources were of type fr i , and most exhibited wat or nat morphologies .",
    "they found no difference in the radio luminosity function at these redshifts compared to that seen nearby , and concluded that there is no evidence for evolution in the population of rich cluster radio galaxies between @xmath13 and the present epoch . to explain the absence of fr ii sources in these clusters , stocke et al .",
    "hypothesize that when fr ii sources seem to appear in cluster environments ( as in h&l91 and z97 ) , the clusters they appear in may contain a lower density intracluster medium . by definition , all of the clusters in the stocke et al .",
    "sample have dense icm because they were selected as bright x - ray sources .",
    "fr i bent - double radio sources ( wats and nats ) then , appear to trace out high - density regions in the universe .",
    "these may appear as clusters , groups , or even fossil - groups  large elliptical galaxies that have cannibalized their neighbors leaving behind the dense gas once associated with the doomed cluster or group ( ponman et al .",
    "1994 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "1999 ; romer et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "previous authors have surveyed the radio properties of clusters selected at optical or x - ray wavelengths ( e.g. ledlow & owen 1995a , 1995b , 1996 ; stocke et al .",
    "1999 ) or have studied the environments of mostly high - power fr i and ii radio sources ( e.g. hill & lilly 1991 ; zirbel 1997 ) . here",
    "we examine the environments of a morphologically selected sample of radio sources .",
    "we derived our sample of bent - double radio galaxies from the vla _ first _ survey ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ; becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) with the initial goal of using them as tracers of distant clusters of galaxies ( blanton et al .",
    "we found that the bent doubles , combined with optical selection criteria , had an 80% success rate at finding distant clusters ( up to @xmath14 ) . here",
    ", we present a complete , low- to moderate - redshift sub - sample of the bent - double sources in order to study their environments , as well as to quantify their success rate at finding clusters .",
    "in addition , we search for correlations between the radio and optical properties of the sources and their surroundings to determine whether any radio properties point toward cluster association .",
    "finally , we correlate our sample with the rosat all sky survey .",
    "we use @xmath15 and , except as otherwise noted , @xmath16 throughout this paper .",
    "our sample of radio galaxies was selected from the _ first _ survey currently being undertaken at the vla using the b configuration ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) .",
    "the survey is projected to cover the 10,000 deg@xmath17 of the north galactic cap plus a supplementary region between @xmath18 and @xmath19 dec in the range 21.5@xmath20r.a.@xmath203.5 h. the peak flux density threshold is 1.0 mjy at 20 cm , the angular resolution is 5@xmath21 , and the astrometric accuracy for all detected sources is better than @xmath22 . in the @xmath23 3000 deg@xmath17 region surveyed as of the april 1997 catalog release , _ first _ detected approximately 270,000 radio sources of which @xmath23 32,000 are double or multiple sources with separations less than @xmath24 ( as of this writing , _ first _ has covered 8000 deg@xmath17 and detected 722,000 sources ) . from the april 1997 catalog , we selected 384 sources which exhibit the bent - double morphology .",
    "the peak and integrated 20 cm flux densities of these sources are typically a few mjy and 10 - 100 mjy , respectively .",
    "the sample was constructed by visually inspecting grayscale plots of all _ first _ sources having more than one component within a circle of radius 60@xmath21 .",
    "all images were examined independently by three of us ( elb , rhb and djh ) ; unambiguous distortion of the radio lobes was required .",
    "if at least two out of three examiners selected a source , it was included in the sample .",
    "objects chosen by only one of us were re - examined , and a few of these were added to the sample .",
    "the sample contains a large fraction of fr i radio galaxies , as these are more frequently found to be distorted than are fr ii s which most often appear as collinear classical doubles .",
    "our sample of 384 objects consists of 50% fr i sources , 25% fr ii sources , and 25 % fr i / ii ( sources with intermediate morphologies ) . thirty - three ( 8.5% ) of these sources are within 5 arcmin of the center of an abell cluster .",
    "we selected and classified these before knowing of their cluster associations ; of these 33 , we classified 80@xmath25 as fr i , 10@xmath25 as fr ii , and 10@xmath25 as fr i / ii .",
    "the bent - double sources are easily recognizable by _ first _ to @xmath26 , providing us with a good opportunity to find new moderate- to high - redshift clusters .",
    "some of the sources classified as fr i / ii and ii may be fr i s that have had extended emission resolved out by _ first _ and/or have had their apparent morphologies altered by 1/@xmath27 surface brightness dimming",
    ". however , the high surface brightnesses and small angular extents of the lobe hot spots which characterize fr ii s make it unlikely that an fr ii would be misclassified as an fr i. thus , even after allowing for some classification errors , the majority of our sources are of type fr i. the most common morphology in our sample is the wide - angle - tail ( wat ) radio source .      the complete sample studied here was chosen to be area- and magnitude - limited .",
    "it contains all bent - double sources from our sample of 384 within the range @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and with r - magnitudes brighter than m@xmath30 for the optical counterparts .",
    "there are 99 bent doubles in the ra and dec ranges listed above , of which 45 have host magnitudes above our chosen limit .",
    "two objects were eliminated because their spectra indicated that they were stars ( at least one of these was an obvious misidentification ) ; in addition , one object was eliminated because we did not obtain a redshift for it although it fell just inside the magnitude limit , one object had a spectrum but no image taken , while one was not observed at all due to observing - time constraints .",
    "our final sample includes 40 objects .",
    "a log of the optical and spectroscopic observations is given in table 1 .",
    "postage - stamp grayscale images of the radio sources are displayed in figure 1 , and the properties of the bent doubles are presented in table 2 . column ( 1 ) lists the identification number , and columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give the source position , which is either the position of the radio core if there is one , or the position of the optical identification .",
    "column ( 4 ) lists the redshift , column ( 5 ) contains the total r - magnitude , column ( 6 ) lists the integrated flux density taken from the nrao / vla sky survey ( _ nvss _ , condon et al . 1996 ) , since _ first _ may resolve out some of the extended emission .",

    ", the optical identifications for all of these appear to be elliptical galaxies .",
    "all of the objects were observed at the mdm observatory with the 2.4 m telescope and the echelle ccd with the exception of three sources ( # 082 , 236 , and 237 ) for which imaging information was taken from the literature .",

    "this f.o.v . was reduced to 8.0 arcmin@xmath17 for the 1998 run ( from which we include observations for only three of the bent doubles ) because the filter was not large enough to cover the entire ccd .    for the 1998 and 1999 runs ,",

    "those fields with only one exposure were cleaned for cosmic rays ( defined as pixels above a certain flux ratio as compared with neighboring pixels ) using the iraf task cosmicrays.    observations were taken under photometric conditions .",
    "standard stars from the landolt ( 1992 ) catalog were used for calibrations .",
    "color , extinction , and zero - point terms were derived each night .",
    "the average ( mean ) color term derived for the 1999 observations was @xmath36 and the average extinction term was @xmath37 .",

    "the derived color term was negligible ( @xmath40 ) and , because of standard star limitations , we were unable to derive a reliable extinction term ; standard stars observed at the same airmasses as the objects were used to derive the photometry .",

    "total magnitudes were measured using focas ( faint object classification and analysis system  valdes 1983 ) and are listed in table 2 . the area used for determining the `` total '' magnitude was found by increasing each object s isophotal area by a factor of two .",
    "focas missed some of the flux for very bright , extended objects and the magnitudes listed for these have possible errors as high as @xmath43 mag . as we obtained only r - band data , an estimate of the ( v - r ) color of an elliptical galaxy at the redshift of the radio host",

    "spectra for an additional four objects were obtained at mdm in december 1998 and were kindly provided by j. halpern .",
    "the majority of the spectroscopic observations at mdm were completed during two runs  february 1998 and 1999 .",
    "they were done in longslit mode , with slit widths of 1.@xmath44 ( february 1998 ) and 1@xmath45 ( february 1999 ) .",
    "both runs used the 600 lines / mm grism with a central wavelength of 5800 @xmath46 .",

    "a spectrum of the bent - double radio source was extracted in each case , and was wavelength- and flux - calibrated .",
    "the wavelength calibrations were derived using comparison lamp observations taken at the beginning and/or end of each night . the data were flux - calibrated using observations of kpno spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "all of the spectra , excepting those of the quasars ( # 115 , 189 , and 249 ) , had absorption lines consistent with old stellar populations that would be expected in elliptical galaxies ( consistent with their morphologies ) .",
    "four ( 11% ) of the non - quasar spectra also had emission lines , typically of [ oii ] @xmath47 , h@xmath48 @xmath49 , and [ oiii ] @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "each of the three quasars had only one broad , bright , emission line , which we assume is mg ii , since other prominent lines would not be expected to appear alone over the wavelength coverage of our spectra .",
    "redshifts for all objects in the sample are listed in table 2 .",
    "the radio properties of the sources are also listed in table 2 .",
    "most of the sources have powers typical of wat radio sources , within a factor of three of 5 @xmath53 w hz@xmath52 at 1440 mhz ( odonoghue et al .",
    "1993 ) . of the 40 sources ,",
    "we classify 27 ( 68% ) as fr i , 8 ( 20% ) as fr ii , and 5 ( 12% ) as fr i / ii .",
    "this is similar to the distribution of types for the whole 384-object bent - double sample .",
    "the higher fraction of fr i s in our low - to - moderate redshift complete sample is at least partly due to surface brightness dimming of high-@xmath54 sources ; the extended lobe emission may not be detected in fr i s at high-@xmath54 , leading to erroneous classification as fr ii s , and producing a higher fraction of fr ii s in the parent sample .",
    "the angular resolution of the _ first _ survey is necessary to recognize the bent double morphology and to determine unambiguously the optical counterpart .",
    "however , the @xmath55 angular resolution of the _ first _ survey resolves out some of the extended emission .",
    "thus , we use the _ nvss _ survey ( angular resolution @xmath56 ) in reporting the source integrated flux densities in table 2 .",
    "the mean ratio of _ nvss _ to _ first _ flux density for the individual sources in the complete sample is 1.3 , with a range in values from 1.0 to 3.1 .",
    "a catalog of objects detected at least 3@xmath42 above the sky was created in focas for each bent - double field .",
    "total magnitudes were determined by measuring the flux within twice each object s isophotal area .",
    "sky values were determined locally . to improve sky subtraction and avoid subtracting off flux from an object s extended envelope , we increased the distance of the sky buffer ( the distance from the edge of an object s isophote to the edge of the annulus where sky is measured ) from the focas default value to be large enough that magnitudes no longer changed as the buffer distance was increased .",
    "richness values for the bent - double fields were estimated following the method used by allington - smith et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and z97 .",
    "the richness statistic @xmath57 measures galaxies within a 0.5 mpc radius of the radio galaxy , and with absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath58 ( which is @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is similar to an abell - type richness measurement , although abell ( 1958 , 1989 ) used the magnitude range @xmath60 to @xmath61 , where @xmath60 is the third brightest cluster member . in all but very nearby clusters , and without spectroscopy for at least several members , the third brightest member is difficult to identify because of the superposition of foreground and background galaxies on the plane of the cluster .",
    "in addition , the @xmath57 statistic has the virtue of measuring the same absolute magnitude range in each potential cluster .    to transform @xmath62-magnitudes to absolute @xmath63-magnitudes ,",
    "an elliptical galaxy spectrum was assumed with a rest frame color @xmath64 , and k - corrections were taken from coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ) .",
    "no evolution correction was applied .",
    "galactic extinction values were taken from schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .    to determine the density of galaxies surrounding each radio source , our raw richness counts needed to be corrected for unrelated field galaxy counts",
    "; we call these `` background counts . ''",
    "ideally , this would be achieved by counting background galaxies directly on the frames .",
    "however , particularly for the lowest-@xmath54 fields , our @xmath65 arcmin images will contain associated cluster or group galaxies even at the edges of the frames and the background would therefore be overestimated .",
    "the other possibility is to use published background counts of galaxies from deep surveys .",
    "we have used a combination of the two methods .",
    "a plot of the number of galaxies and stars ( per 0.1 mag per deg@xmath17 ) catalogued on all 33 frames for which we determined a richness value is shown in figure 2 . from this plot ,",
    "it is evident that on average , our frames are complete to approximately @xmath66 where the star and galaxy counts both suddenly plummet . in addition the star / galaxy classification in focas breaks down at @xmath67 for our fields",
    ". results from the deep survey of metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1991 ) indicate that star counts make up approximately 10% of the total counts at @xmath68 and less than 2% at @xmath69 .",
    "as seen in figure 2 , the fraction of stars at these magnitudes determined by focas for our frames is much higher ; it is obvious that , at faint magnitudes ( @xmath70 or 22 ) , many galaxies are being erroneously classified as stars . in order to account for this ,",
    "we include objects classified as stars , and with magnitudes fainter than @xmath71 and down to the @xmath72 corresponding to @xmath58 , in our richness measurements .",
    "only the higher redshift bent doubles will be affected by this misclassification , because it is only at relatively high @xmath54 that @xmath58 corresponds to a sufficiently faint apparent magnitude that misclassified objects affect the richness statistic .",
    "the lowest @xmath54 object affected by this is # 177 at @xmath73 . for the bent",

    "when we compare the mean richnesses of the environments surrounding the fr i s in our sample and z97 s sample , however , we find no significant difference . specific morphologies ( i.e. , bent or collinear ) were not noted in z97 . however , since the fr i sources in the z97 sample have powers near or above the fr i / ii break , it is likely that many of them are wats .",
    "in fact , the mean power for the fr i s in the z97 sample , converting to 1440 mhz assuming @xmath105 with @xmath31 , is an order of magnitude higher than the mean power of the fr i s in our sample : mean @xmath106 w hz@xmath52 with a range of @xmath107 w hz@xmath52 to @xmath108 w hz@xmath52 ( z97 ) vs. mean @xmath109 w hz@xmath52 with a range of @xmath110 w hz@xmath52 to @xmath111 w hz@xmath52 ( our sample ) .",
    "it is unclear if there is any difference in the gas content of the source environments in the two samples  in particular , whether our sample , which was specifically chosen by radio morphology , contains sources that reside in environments that harbor denser gas more often than powerful fr i environments in general .",
    "x - ray observations are necessary to decide this .",
    "there is an approximately fifty - fifty chance of finding a cluster when optically following up on a bent - double radio source . from our richness values",
    ", we find that 54% of the bent doubles in the complete sample are found in clusters of abell richness class 0 or greater .",
    "figure 3a shows an example of a bent double in a rich environment .",
    "in addition , 46% of the objects are found in groups or the field , suggesting either that dense gas can be found in groups , some of them rather poor , or that there are alternative bending mechanisms distorting the radio lobes .",
    "an example of a source found in a poor environment is displayed in figure 3b .",
    "venkatesan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) claim that narrow - angle - tail ( nat ) sources may be found in poor environments because it is the _ local _ galaxy environment , rather than the global cluster environment , that produces the dominant effect on the radio morphology . in their model ,",
    "a poor cluster icm combined with high - velocity , infalling galaxies can bend radio lobes .",
    "such high velocities would be possible in poor clusters in the early stages of collapse .",
    "burns et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found clumped x - ray emission around radio sources in abell clusters . while some of the x - rays may come from the agn powering the extended radio source ,",
    "the emission is often extended .",
    "their study concludes that local clumped gas may bend radio lobes , and that this gas is a signature of a recent cluster - cluster ( or group ) merger .",
    "wide - angle - tail ( wat ) radio sources , then , may be pointers to clusters in formation , or those that have recently undergone mergers .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that wat clusters generally do not have cooling flows , which are found in relaxed clusters .",
    "another theory , put forth by stocke & burns ( 1987 ) is that the low dynamical pressure resulting from gas associated with a group of galaxies allows radio jets to expand more quickly .",
    "this , in turn , lowers the density and pressure of the jets , allowing them to be bent more easily .    in x - ray surveys ,",
    "a new class of objects called `` fossil groups '' has recently been discovered ( ponman et al .",
    "1994 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "1999 ; romer et al .",
    "these objects display extended emission in the x - ray , and their optical counterparts are single , large , bright elliptical galaxies that appear to reside in poor environments .",
    "they may represent groups of galaxies that have been `` cannibalized '' by the bright elliptical , leaving behind only the extended x - ray gas .",
    "the dense gas associated with these systems may represent a significant mass component to the universe that would be missed by optical surveys .",
    "we discuss here the statistical properties of the complete sample ; in all that follows , we exclude the three quasars ( all high - power fr ii objects ) from further consideration .",
    "all but eight of the 37 host galaxies are brightest cluster / group galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the scatter in host absolute magnitude is small , with all but eight of the objects lying within @xmath112 mag of the median value of m@xmath113 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "indeed , the apparent magnitude distribution ( figure 5 ) is very similar to a plot of r - mag vs. @xmath54 for the no - evolution model of an elliptical galaxy ( coleman , wu , & weedman 1980 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results of ledlow & owen ( 1995b ) who found that the host elliptical galaxies of fr i radio sources are indistinguishable from elliptical galaxies with no radio emission .",
    "they conclude that , given the lifetimes of radio sources ( @xmath114 yrs ) , all elliptical galaxies may at some point contain powerful radio sources .",
    "the distribution of radio power , plotted as a function of redshift , is displayed in figure 6 .",
    "most of the sources lie below the canonical fri / frii dividing line and three - quarters of the objects lie at least a factor of two below this boundary . apart from the expected lack of rare , high - power sources in the small local volume and the lower envelope produced by the survey s radio flux density threshold , no trends with @xmath54 are apparent .",
    "there is no correlation between radio power and host galaxy magnitude , with radio power ranging over two orders of magnitude for a given optical luminosity .",
    "this is also consistent with the findings of ledlow & owen ( 1995a ; 1996 ) .",
    "there is also no correlation seen between the redshift of the radio source and the richness of its associated cluster ( figure 7 ) . out to @xmath115 ,",
    "the cluster environments are just as rich as they are at present day .",
    "this is consistent with the results of h&l91 for their subsample of fr i objects .",
    "cluster richness is also found to be uncorrelated with the linear sizes and opening angles of the radio sources . while richer environments might be expected to provide greater confining pressures and bending forces , the complications introduced by host locations with respect to the cluster center and galaxy velocities obscure any underlying trends .",
    "finally radio power and richness are uncorrelated ( figure 8) .",
    "this is consistent with the survey of ledlow & owen ( 1995a ) which found no correlation between the total radio power of all galaxies in a cluster and the cluster richness .",
    "most of our sources occur alone in their clusters at the sensitivity of _ first _ , and if there are other radio sources in the clusters , the bent - double is almost always the dominant source of radio power for the cluster .",
    "correlation of the @xmath116 complete sample of bent doubles with the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) bright and faint source catalogs reveals that eight of the radio sources lie within one megaparsec of the position of an x - ray source .",
    "in addition to these eight , the two radio sources in coma also match with detections in the survey .",
    "matched source # 249 is a quasar at @xmath117 , and the x - ray source matched with the bent - double # 082 is probably unrelated to the radio source .",
    "this x - ray source is point - like and there is a 17th magnitude stellar object located @xmath118 away as well as a 10th magnitude star located @xmath119 away .",
    "the x - ray source is likely associated with one of these objects .",
    "the eight objects ( excluding coma ) are listed in table 4 .",
    "column ( 1 ) lists the bent - double i d # , column ( 2 ) gives the redshift , column ( 3 ) shows the match distance between the radio and x - ray source in arcminutes , column ( 4 ) gives the rass i d name , column ( 5 ) lists the rass count rate , column ( 6 ) gives the source extent as listed in the rass catalog , where a value of zero indicates that a source is point - like ( however , see comments below ) , column ( 7 ) gives two estimates for unabsorbed x - ray flux , using a thermal bremsstrahlung model , galactic @xmath120 and temperatures of 3 kev and 1 kev ( except for bent - doubles # 249 and # 082 where no estimates are given ) , column ( 8) converts the fluxes in the previous column to luminosities , and column ( 9 ) gives the optical richnesses for the fields .",
    "when total source counts are low , as is the case for most of our sources , the rass measurement of extent is subject to error .",
    "therefore , for each of the sources catalogued as point - like , we visually examined the rass images after smoothing them with a @xmath121 gaussian .",
    "this inspection confirmed that the x - ray sources associated with objects # 249 and # 082 are point - like , while revealing that the source associated with # 261 could be either point - like or extended , and the x - ray sources associated with # 186 and # 228 are clearly extended .    excluding the quasar and the unassociated object , based on our richness measurements , five of the six x - ray - detected sources",
    "are classified as being members of clusters .",
    "the remaining one is listed in abell s catalog as a richness class 1 cluster , but falls just short of our cluster criteria .",
    "one of the other matched objects is also a member of an abell cluster , and one is found in a zwicky cluster .",
    "the sources have typical estimated x - ray luminosities of a few times @xmath122 erg s@xmath52 .",
    "a plot of redshift vs. x - ray luminosity is given in figure 9 .",
    "the long - dashed lines mark @xmath123 = 10@xmath124 , 10@xmath125 , and 10@xmath126 erg s@xmath52 .",
    "the curved lines are the approximate limits of the rass catalog with the upper line ( long - short dash ) for a 3 kev model and the lower ( short dash ) for a 1 kev model .",
    "these were generated by taking the faint rass requirement that a source have 6 counts to be in the catalog , combined with the average exposure for the matching objects of 400 sec , to get a limiting count rate of 0.015 ct / s , and converting to flux with pimms .    above the curves ,",
    "the solid circles represent the matched sources luminosities expected for a 3 kev thermal bremsstrahlung model , using galactic @xmath127 , and distances with @xmath16 and @xmath128 km s@xmath52 mpc@xmath52 .",
    "the open circles are the same but for a 1 kev model",
    ". the matched object at @xmath129 is slightly below the limit , but was detected because the exposure for that pointing was slightly longer ( 418 s ) than average and it had only six counts . at @xmath130 ,",
    "the bent doubles that were not detected in the rass , but are found in clusters , based on our richness measurements , are plotted as filled triangles .",
    "those that are classified as not belonging to clusters and are not detected in the rass , are plotted as asterisks .    not including coma , for @xmath131 , there are six bent doubles that are members of clusters ( based on our richness measurements ) and four of these are detected in the rass .",
    "we classify nine bent doubles at @xmath131 as non - cluster members , and only one of these is detected  the one that is a member of an abell cluster and fell just shy of our limit for being called a cluster .",
    "the majority of the low redshift bent doubles that are found in clusters are detected in the rass , and those that are not found in clusters are not detected in the rass .",
    "this result supports our richness measurements , and suggests that the x - ray flux is probably from cluster , rather than agn , emission .",
    "we have presented observations of a complete , magnitude - limited sample of 40 objects taken from our larger sample of bent - double radio sources .",
    "our richness measurements indicate that they can be used as tracers of high - density environments  54% are associated with abell class 0 or richer clusters . the majority of our sample s lowest redshift objects ( @xmath131 ) that we classified as cluster members are detected in the rosat all sky survey .",
    "interestingly , 46% of the sample bent doubles are associated with groups , some of them poor .",
    "the lobes in these environments may be bent by clumped gas in the vicinity of the radio source .",
    "the galaxies may have high velocities relative to this gas if they are parts of groups or clusters in formation .",
    "x - ray observations would shed light on this scenario .    some of the sources in the complete sample exist in previously recognized clusters : six in abell ( 1958 , 1989 ) clusters , including two in coma , and four in zwicky ( 1968 ) clusters . within the area of the complete sample ,",
    "there are a total of 102 clusters in the abell catalog , so our sources `` discovered '' @xmath132 of them , suggesting , to the extent the abell catalog is complete , that @xmath133 of clusters house bent - double sources .",
    "almost all of the radio sources in the complete sample are associated with the first - ranked galaxy in their cluster or group , consistent with results from other wat samples .",
    "in addition , their large linear sizes ( approximately 100  500 kpc ) and powers near the fr i / ii break are typical of wat sources ( odonoghue et al . 1993 ) .",
    "few of the radio and optical properties were found to be correlated . in particular , no correlations are seen between richness of the host environment and the linear extent or bending angle of the radio lobes .",
    "the complicated interactions between cluster gas , central engine , and extended lobes , as well as the position of the host galaxy in the cluster and its velocity relative to the icm , make it unsurprising that there is not a one - to - one relationship between either richness and linear size or richness and bending angle .    before making the magnitude cut , there were 99 bent doubles in the area of the complete sample , implying that more than half of the radio sources have host magnitudes fainter than @xmath134 .",
    "given the narrow distribution in host optical luminosities ( figure 4 ) , these sources must have redshifts greater than @xmath135 or 0.5 , and can be used to identify such distant clusters with an efficiency of at least 50@xmath25 ( cf .",
    "blanton et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "several of the objects in our sample are in notably low density environments , and may be associated with fossil groups or single galaxies .",
    "these types of systems may represent a significant mass component of the universe that would be missed by optical surveys .",
    "x - ray observations are planned to study these objects to determine if there is indeed extended gas associated with them , or if we must find another explanation for the bending of the radio lobes .",
