    "software quality costs and economics have been subject to research for decades now .",
    "consequently , there is a variety of corresponding models on all levels of abstraction as a result of this research .",
    "the development and improvement of these models is important , especially for the decision makers in real software projects @xcite .",
    "this becomes obvious when considering that there are many estimates that assign 3050% of the development costs to quality assurance @xcite .",
    "a newer study of the national institute of standards and technology of the united states @xcite found that even 80% of the development costs are caused by the detection and removal of defects .",
    "hence , models are needed to control and minimise these costs . yet , for this to be feasible we need to incorporate them into existing development processes .",
    "thereby , we make them operational and accessible for decision - makers .",
    "most models are not directly applicable in a real development process .",
    "they often only classify the relevant costs but do not show how to use this classification .",
    "even operational models often neglect the fact that they need to be used in the context of a specific process model .",
    "the usage of such models is mainly in an ad - hoc manner and they are not systematically included in process models .",
    "the contribution lies in the seamless integration of a model for analytical software quality assurance into the existing process model v - modell  xt .",
    "we show how our qa model is operationally used and which roles , products , and activities are involved in using the model in practice .",
    "this allows an easy adoption of the model for a project that follows the v - modell  xt .",
    "although similar ad - hoc usages of such models are practice in some companies , we are not aware of an earlier systematic integration .",
    "first , we introduce quality economics in general and in terms of the analytical model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vmodell ] we describe the basics of the considered process model and its underlying meta - model .",
    "[ sec : integration ] then shows the integration of the model with the v - modell xt .",
    "we finish with related work in sec .  [",
    "sec : related ] and final conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we first describe the cost types and other factors that are important in the context of the economics of analytical quality assurance .",
    "then we give a short overview of the analytical model from @xcite that is to be integrated in the process model v - modell  xt later .",
    "we reduce the classical paf ( prevention , appraisal , failure ) model of quality costs to an af ( appraisal , failure ) model .",
    "we ignore _ prevention costs _ that contain the costs of preventing defects by constructive qa because constructive qa has significantly different characteristics . _",
    "appraisal costs _",
    "contain all costs for checking artefacts to detect defects , e.g. , test specification and execution .",
    "the debugging is then part of the failure costs .",
    "when the failure occurs in - house it incurs _ internal failure costs_. failures during operation at the customer cause _ external failure costs_. we refine these parts so that we can identify the relevant cost factors . the complete refined model is shown in fig .  [ fig : costs_revisited ] .",
    "the appraisal costs are detailed to _ setup _ and _ execution _ costs .",
    "the former constituting all initial costs for buying test tools , configuring the test environment , and so on .",
    "the latter includes costs that are connected to actual test executions or review meetings , mainly personnel costs .        on the nonconformance side , we have _ fault removal _ costs that can be attributed to the internal failure costs as well as the external failure costs .",
    "this is because if we found a fault and wanted to remove it , it would always result in costs no matter whether caused by an internal or external failure .",
    "actually , there does not have to be a failure at all .",
    "considering code inspections , faults are found and removed that have never caused a failure during testing .",
    "fault removal costs also contain the costs for necessary re - testing and re - inspections .",
    "external failures also cause _ effect _ costs . those are all further costs associated with the failure apart from the removal costs .",
    "for example , compensation costs could be part of the effect costs , if the failure caused some kind of damage at the customer site .",
    "we might also include other costs such as loss of sales because of bad reputation in the effect costs .    furthermore , there are also technical factors that are important for the quality economics of analytical quality assurance .",
    "the two main factors that we consider in the following model are ( 1 ) the difficulty of defect - detection and ( 2 ) the failure probability of faults .",
    "we denote the probability that a specific defect - detection technique does not detect a defect of a specific type as its difficulty .",
    "this factor has been shown to be influential @xcite . a smaller but still substantial impact stems from the failure probability of faults .",
    "this is important because many faults occur only with a very small probability during operation @xcite .",
    "we use the stochastic quality assurance model from @xcite as the model to be integrated in the v - modell  xt .",
    "actually , we only consider the _ practical _ model from this work because that is the one to be applied .",
    "it is derived from a _ theoretical _ model that incorporates more factors and more detail . however , the main factors described above are still contained in this model .    the main idea of the model is to compute the expected values of the costs and benefits of quality assurance . for this purpose , they are structured in three components : direct costs , future costs and revenues .",
    "the determination of the expected values is based on average values calculated from literature and finished projects . during the project",
    ", measured data can be used to refine the results .",
    "we define @xmath0 to be the defect type of fault @xmath1 .",
    "it is determined using the defect type distribution of older projects . in this way",
    "we do not have to look at individual faults but analyse and measure defect types for which the determination of interesting quantities is possible during quality assurance .",
    "we will not further elaborate the concept of defect types but refer to defect classification approaches from ibm @xcite or hp @xcite . for the sake of a simple presentation , we first give equations for a single defect - detection technique and generalise that to a combination of techniques .",
    "we start with the direct costs @xmath2 of a defect - detection technique .",
    "they are all costs that occur directly by using the technique .",
    "@xmath3}= { u_a}+ { e_a(t_a)}+ \\sum_{i } {               ( 1 - { \\theta_a({\\tau_i},t_a ) } ) { v_a({\\tau_i})}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the average setup cost for technique @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the average execution cost for @xmath5 with effort @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the average removal cost for defect type @xmath0 .",
    "the future costs @xmath9 are those costs that will occur when defects are not detect by the technique . @xmath10}=    \\sum_i{\\pi_{\\tau_i } { \\theta_a({\\tau_i},t_a)}({v_f({\\tau_i})}+ { f_f({\\tau_i})})}.\\ ] ]    finally , the revenues @xmath11 are the saved future costs , i.e. , the costs that will not incur because the technique finds them .",
    "@xmath12}=    \\sum_i{\\pi_{\\tau_i } ( 1 - { \\theta_a({\\tau_i},t_a)})({v_f({\\tau_i})}+ { f_f({\\tau_i})})},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the average effect costs of a fault of type @xmath0 .",
    "the extension to more than one technique needs to consider whether the defects have been found by earlier used techniques .",
    "the following is the equation for the expected value of the direct costs : @xmath14 = \\sum_{x \\in x}{\\biggl [ } & { u_x}+ { e_x(t_x)}+          \\sum_i{\\bigl [         ( 1 - \\theta_x({\\tau_i},t_x ) ) } \\\\         & \\cdot \\prod_{y < x}{\\bigl ( \\theta_y({\\tau_i},t_y ) }         \\bigr ) { v_x({\\tau_i})}\\bigr ] \\biggr ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the ordered set of the used defect - detection techniques .",
    "also the expected value of the combined future costs @xmath16 can be formulated in the practical model using defect types .",
    "@xmath17 = \\sum_i{\\biggl [ } & \\pi_{{\\tau_i } }                   \\prod_{x \\in x}{\\bigl(\\theta_x({\\tau_i},t_x )                  \\bigr ) } \\\\                  & \\cdot \\bigl ( { v_f({\\tau_i})}+ { f_f({\\tau_i})}\\bigr ) \\biggr ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] finally , the expected value of the combined revenues @xmath18 are defined accordingly .",
    "@xmath19 = \\sum_{x \\in x}{\\sum_i{\\biggl [ } } & \\pi_{{\\tau_i } }         ( 1 - \\theta_x({\\tau_i},t_x ) )          \\prod_{y < x}{\\bigl ( \\theta_y({\\tau_i},t_y ) }                               \\bigr ) \\\\          & \\cdot \\bigl ( { v_f({\\tau_i})}+ { f_f({\\tau_i})}\\bigr ) \\biggr ] \\end{split}\\ ] ]      using the practical model , we identify only seven different types of quantities that are needed to use the model :    * estimated number of faults : @xmath20 * distribution of defect types * difficulty functions for each technique and type @xmath21 * average removal costs for type @xmath0 with technique @xmath22 : @xmath23 * average removal costs for type @xmath0 in the field : @xmath24 * average effect costs for type @xmath0 in the field : @xmath25 * failure probability of fault of type @xmath0 : @xmath26    for an early application of the model , average values from a literature review can be used as first estimates .",
    "we did an extensive analysis of those values in @xcite and ranked them using sensitivity analysis in @xcite . for more specific estimations",
    "we can use more sophisticated methods : the coqualmo model @xcite allows to determine an estimate of the number of faults contained in the software .",
    "the defect removal effort for different defect types can be predicted using an association mining approach of song et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "optimisation is the key to using the model operationally in a project .",
    "it allows to calculate an optimal effort distribution for the used defect - detection techniques .",
    "only two of the three components of the model are needed because the future costs and the revenues are dependent on each other .",
    "there is a specific number of faults that have associated costs when they occur in the field .",
    "these costs are divided in the two parts that are associated with the revenues and the future costs , respectively .",
    "the total always stays the same , only the size of the parts varies depending on the defect - detection technique .",
    "therefore , we use only the direct costs and the revenues for optimisation and consider the future costs to be dependent on the revenues .",
    "hence , the optimisation problem can be stated by : maximise @xmath27 . by using eq .",
    "[ eq : practical_direct_combined ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : practical_revenues_combined ] we get the following term to be maximised .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    for the optimisation purposes , we usually also have some restrictions , for example a maximum effort @xmath29 with @xmath30 , either fixed length or none @xmath31 , or some fixed orderings of techniques , that have to be taken into account . the latter is typically true for different forms of testing as system tests are always later in the development than unit tests .",
    "we assume there is sufficient tool - support available to solve this optimisation problem",
    "the v - modell xt  @xcite is a recently released german software and system development standard .",
    "it covers all relevant management , engineering and supporting processes of software development , for instance project management , quality assurance , offer , bidding and contract management , and also technical disciplines such as requirements engineering , system design and integration , software development and more specific engineering activities .",
    "the goals of the v - modell xt are to provide a generic development process model , which is easy to understand and to use , flexibly adaptable to the needs of organisations and projects , and reproducibly leading to developed products of higher quality with less cost and resources spent .      in order to extend the v - modell xt it is imperative to know its main concepts .",
    "the v - modell xt is based on a rigorous meta - model , which defines all concepts and their relationships .",
    "the entire process model strictly follows this meta - model , which is a prerequisite for flexible extensibility .",
    "the main concepts of the v - modell xt are :    * _ work products _ are the main project results and artefacts ( documents , models , code , deliverable systems ) .",
    "they have a defined structure and prescribed content , and can be structured further into specific subjects ( sub - sections ) .",
    "work products have a responsible creator and will be quality checked .",
    "an evaluation specification defines the requirements for their quality . *",
    "_ product dependencies _ define the consistency relations between the contents of different work products . adhering to and checking product dependencies",
    "makes sure that all work products in a project will be created and kept consistent to existing products .",
    "product dependencies are an important means to assure overall product quality and to trace information across products , for instance from requirements to software architecture elements . *",
    "_ activities _ define the actions that need to be performed in order to create the work products .",
    "activities can be structured further into sub - activities .",
    "activities provide support for the actual doing within a project .",
    "there is exactly one activity per work product . in case",
    "there are multiple instances or iterations of a certain work product , the respective activity is performed several times , accordingly . each activity creates a work product ; therefore it is directly followed by a product evaluation for qa , if required . * _ roles _ describe profiles of responsibility for the people working in the project .",
    "roles will be impersonated by specific people in the project . * _ process modules _ group together work products , activities and roles , as well as other v - modell  xt elements into self - contained units covering certain project processes , such as project management , requirements management , systems integration , software development , etc .",
    "process modules have a hierarchy of dependence .",
    "they can be understood , applied and modified independently if adhering to these dependencies .",
    "process modules are the main units of tailoring and extension of the v - modell  xt .",
    "important for the v - modell  xt extension mechanism is that process modules can define work products , subjects , activities , sub - activities etc .",
    "that modularly and seamlessly extend existing processes of the core process modules .",
    "* _ tailoring _ is the process of adapting the v - modell  xt to a specific project or organisation .",
    "tailoring consists of selecting the appropriate process modules out of the repository of available ones .",
    "after the tailoring , a consistent and adapted software development process exists .",
    "it is indistinguishable to the user from which process modules which specific elements  work products , their subjects ,",
    "extensions etc  came from .",
    "quality assurance is a cornerstone within a process model such as the v - modell xt .",
    "it is the main means to ensure result quality by constructive and analytical means .",
    "the qa mechanisms of the v - modell xt are manifold and cover the following areas :    1 .",
    "_ organisational quality management .",
    "_ organisational units define general quality standards , guidelines and metrics to be applied in projects .",
    "they also archive results in metric catalogues to be used by subsequent projects in order to continuously improve the process on the organisational level .",
    "the v - modell  xt does not define these processes but provides an interface to them .",
    "the responsible role is the _ quality manager_. 2 .",
    "_ project setup .",
    "_ during project setup , the _ project manual _ and the _ qa manual _ are created which define standards , general rules and guidelines that must be applied during the project .",
    "the _ qa manual _ in particular defines the constructive and analytical methods that are applied for each different type of project result to ensure the desired product quality .",
    "responsible for these tasks are the _ project leader _ and the _",
    "qa manager_. 3 .",
    "_ product evaluation .",
    "_ project results are evaluated according to a product specific evaluation specification , following an evaluation procedure .",
    "the means applied for evaluating a certain product vary depending on its importance and criticality .",
    "_ qa reports _ are created in defined intervals describing the state and potential quality problems of the product under construction based on the results of the product evaluations .",
    "_ evaluators _ are responsible for evaluations and the _ qa manager _ for the reports .",
    "_ project management .",
    "_ the project management decides about general project progress based on project and _ qa reports_. in case of need , it applies corrective means to increase product quality .",
    "project management reports to the customer and higher levels in the organisation ; it is responsible for the overall project result quality as well as for observing agreed upon delivery deadlines and costs .",
    "the responsible role is the _ project leader_.      the v - modell  xt already contains an optional process module named `` measurement and analysis '' .",
    "it is very lightweight and only provides the ideas of applying quality analysing metrics within a project .",
    "this process module depends only on the core process module of `` project management '' .",
    "besides , it does not have any other dependencies , and does not extend the general process module `` quality assurance '' .    in order to keep the compliance level with the standard v - modell  xt as high as possible , we replace the existing `` measurement and analysis '' process module with our own one .",
    "however , we reuse the elements defined in the existing process module and complement them with new elements and extended content .",
    "in this section we show the exemplary embedding of our model in the process model _ v - modell xt _",
    "@xcite , as described in the previous section .",
    "an integration with other process models such as the rup  @xcite can be done accordingly . for the v - modell  xt integration",
    ", we define a new process module `` measurement and analysis of analytical qa '' containing roles , products , and activities .",
    "we first give a brief overview of the general analytical qa process and then describe the contents of the process module in more detail .",
    "the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : activity1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : activity2 ] give an overview of the usage of our model as part of the v - modell xt .",
    "we relate the activities to the different qa processes of the v - modell  xt described in sec .",
    "[ sec : vmqa ] .    1 .",
    "the _ quality manager _ is responsible for defining and documenting cross - project quality standards , metrics , and methods , within the _ quality management manual_. furthermore , he defines and maintains the _ metrics catalogue _ that must contain all the necessary input factors summarised in sec .",
    "[ sec : needed ] .",
    "quality manager _ must also provide an infrastructure that is able to store the corresponding metrics .",
    "2 .   within a project ,",
    "the _ project leader _ is responsible for setting up the project initially .",
    "the _ project leader _ performs basic estimations for the project including the defect estimate needed for our model .",
    "he can get supporting data from similar projects using the _",
    "metrics infrastructure_. based on these estimates , he uses our model to calculate an optimised quality assurance and he documents this as part of the _",
    "qa manual_. also during project setup , the _ qa manager _ is responsible for implementing the guidelines from the _ quality management manual _ within the project . in collaboration with the _ project leader _ he defines the _ qa manual _ and provides input for the qa relevant sections of the _ project",
    "manual_. the project setup results in a completed _ project manual _ where project goals and guidelines for supporting project processes , such as measurement and analysis are defined .",
    "during the course of the project , _ evaluators _ are performing the product qa tasks . depending on the specific requirements for specific work products",
    "as expressed in the _ qa manual _ , they are preparing _ evaluation specifications _ and _ evaluation procedures _ for each evaluated product . the _ project plan _ , under responsibility of project management ,",
    "plans the occurrences of the product evaluations and qa measures . according to these guidelines",
    ", the _ evaluators _ perform the actual product evaluations and document the results in _ evaluation reports _ , which include all measurements that can be later used in our model such as the number and type of the detected defects . in regular intervals , the _ qa manager",
    "_ compiles _ quality status reports _ out of the product _",
    "evaluation reports_. 4 .",
    "the _ project leader _ and project management are continuously assessing project progress and are responsible for making regular project progress decisions , which act as `` quality gates ''",
    ". one important source of input for these decisions are the _ quality status reports_. project management can use the available information to apply our model to evaluate different scenarios and optimise the further qa strategy .",
    "the results will refine the _ project plan _ and might lead to an update of the _",
    "qa manual_. when the project is finished , the project leader collects the _ measurement data _ relevant for our model and forwards it to the _ quality manager _ who stores it in the metrics infrastructure .      in the following we show in greater detail the extensions to the v - modell  xt we made to embed our analytical qa model",
    "the v - modell  xt was created as a generic process model which already puts significant effort on qa and related management processes .",
    "it thus already provides the basic framework for analytical qa . to fit our model",
    ", we have to extend existing elements of the v - modell and add a few new ones . mainly this is only more detail on the explicit measurement and collection of the data for the model input factors . for our extension , we concentrate on products , activities and roles .",
    "the integration of our analytical quality model affects the responsibilities of 4 roles that already exist in the v - modell  xt .",
    "their role profile descriptions are sufficiently abstract and fit our purposes .",
    "thus , only slight extensions need to be performed :    * the _ quality manager _ is responsible for quality assurance standards across all projects and for an efficient and effective quality management system . in particular , he develops a systematic quality management and creates and maintains the _ quality management manual_. most importantly in our context , he defines rules and approaches how projects plan and perform quality assurance techniques .",
    "furthermore , he defines which qa techniques should be used in general and helps in choosing appropriate techniques for a specific project .",
    "we add that he is responsible for setting up and maintaining the _ metrics infrastructure_. * the _ project leader _ , as the leader of the project s execution , plans and controls the project s progress . in particular",
    ", he makes the basic estimates for project planning and decides on future changes based on status reports .",
    "the main extension for this role is that he uses our model for optimising the resource distribution for quality assurance and also collects the necessary measurement data for our model . *",
    "the _ qa manager _ controls the quality in a project and thereby supervises all quality assurance .",
    "he is responsible for the _ quality status reports _ and also plans the qa work in collaboration with others .",
    "there is only the small addition that in his _ quality status report _ the necessary measurements for the model must be contained .",
    "* the _ evaluator _  also called _ inspector _ although he not only uses inspections ",
    "creates evaluation specifications and using those evaluates the artefacts created in the project .",
    "hence , he uses defect - detection techniques , e.g. , reviews and tests , on those artefacts and reports the results . also for the _ evaluator",
    "_ it is necessary that he documents the necessary measurements for the model factors .",
    "work products are the main v - modell elements and also the core project results .",
    "work products have one responsible role .",
    "the following list shows the work products that need to be considered , extended or added to apply our model :    * the _ quality management manual _ is a work product that we add to capture  among other subjects  organisation - wide definitions of the metrics that need to be collected for the usage of the model .",
    "metrics definitions _ is one subject in this product .",
    "responsible role for this product is the _",
    "quality manager_. the v - modell  xt mentions such a document but does not officially introduce it . * we also add the _ metrics catalog _ , which exists in the v - modell  xt only as subject of an organisation - wide process model , for process adaptation and improvement ( org ) projects .",
    "we reuse the subject description and establish it as a full product under the responsibility of the _",
    "quality manager_. we additionally explicitly require the incorporation of the factors from sec .  [ sec : needed ] .",
    "thereby , we can reference this product in regular development projects . * the _ metrics infrastructure _",
    "is the third new work product under the responsibility of the _ quality manager_. it is in essence similar to the existing _ project management infrastructure _ but not project specific . in our context it needs to store the measured data for the relevant metrics of our model and provide access to it across projects over an extended period of time .",
    "* we extend the existing product _ estimation _ with a new subject _ estimation of the defect content _ that contains data , which we use later in our model .",
    "responsible is the _ project leader_. * we extend the existing products _ evaluation report _ and _ quality status report _ with new subjects that will contain the necessary measurement data for the factors of sec .",
    "[ sec : needed ] responsible are _ evaluator _ resp . _",
    "qa manager _ roles .",
    "* we use the existing work product _ measurement data _ to capture all data that is collected in the course of the project for calculating the relevant metrics of our model .",
    "responsible for this product is the _ project leader_. * the _ metrics analysis _ is another existing work product under the responsibility of the _ project leader_. it contains detailed analyses of the relevant metrics of our model based on the previously measured data .",
    "each work product has exactly one associated activity . during execution of such an activity one instance or iteration of the work product",
    "is created or edited .",
    "after the completion of the activity , a product evaluation is performed according the qa guidelines .",
    "the following list explains the relevant activities and sub - activities to apply our model .",
    "most are related to the given work products above :    * we introduce a new activity _ preparing and maintaining quality management manual _ doing what its name says . a sub - activity describes how the necessary metrics for applying our model are selected and defined . *",
    "we introduce the existing sub - activity _ preparing and maintaining metrics catalogue _ of the v - modell  xt as full activity creating and maintaining the product",
    "_ metrics catalog_. * the new activity _ setting up and maintaining the metrics infrastructure _ will make sure that a data repository is available for the measurement data . *",
    "the main element of our analytical quality assurance model is introduced into the v - model  xt as new sub - activity _ optimise qa_. it belongs to the activity _ preparing the qa manual_. this sub - activity is performed by the _ project leader _ with help from the _ qa manager _ based on his estimates and data from similar projects .",
    "he calibrates the model and optimises it ( w.r.t .",
    "cost or roi ) so that an optimal resource distribution is found .",
    "this is then documented in the _",
    "qa manual_. * the activity _ collecting measurement data _ describes how the resp .",
    "product is created and edited . a new sub - activity activity _",
    "archiving measurement data _ requires that the measurement data will be stored during the project and at its end so that they are available across projects and for new projects .",
    "* the existing activity _ calculating and analysing metrics _ is extended with a new sub - activity to extract the data that is to be stored for future projects in the _ metrics infrastructure_. * we add to the activity _ coming to a project progress decision _ a new sub - activity which uses our economics model as basis for the decision .",
    "different scenarios can be analysed and an optimal effort ( or resource ) distribution can be calculated .",
    "we package all above described new work products and activities as well as product / activity extensions in form of subjects and sub - activities as part of our new process module .",
    "we add general descriptions and an overview of the process module contents .",
    "thereby we have performed a fully modular extension of the v - model  xt that a _ project leader _ can choose or not choose to apply during initial v - modell tailoring for a new project .",
    "in summary , we find that our model blends well with the v - modell  xt . the necessary changes and additions to use the model fit with the existing structure and require only additions and slight extensions of existing v - modell  xt elements .",
    "they all can be packages nicely as a process module .",
    "an embedding into other process models with a similar structuring should be possible with a comparable effort .",
    "one of the challenges of integrating our analytical quality assurance model into the v - modell  xt is the scope of the described process .",
    "our model covers activities on both the organisational level  spanning multiple projects  and the project level .",
    "the main focus of the v - modell  xt is to describe a process for conducting a particular project : once a project is initiated and the decision to use the v - modell  xt is made , the tailoring activity will result in a project specific process .",
    "the v - modell  xt does not specifically cover organisation - wide processes , such as quality management and continuous process improvement .",
    "however , this is not a limitation , because it can easily be extended  we have done this for our integration .",
    "this results in a responsibility of the organisation to apply the v - modell  xt process across projects and to provide the necessary infrastructure .",
    "a consequence of our modular extension of the v - modell is the sometimes artificial separation between project specific and organisation specific work product ( and activity ) definitions , such as the _ project infrastructure _ and the _ metrics infrastructure_. additionally , the existing v - modell  xt process support for the _ introduction and maintenance of organisation - specific process models _  the process module org  covers part of the organisation - wide activities without being combinable and integrated with project specific processes .",
    "thus , we chose to introduce some redundancy for the sake of modularity and clear understandability",
    ".    one of the prerequisites of our approach is the necessity to have comparable projects which yield expressive metrics data .",
    "the higher the degree of similarity between the projects and the better the measured metrics data , the more precise will our model be able to optimise the qa processes .",
    "general efficiency models of defect - detection techniques such as the inspection model of kusumoto et al .",

    "one main problem is that the usage of those model is often not clear .",

    "we are not aware of other models of quality assurance that have explicitly been integrated into an existing process model .",
    "the benefits of this work are two - fold : ( 1 ) organisations that follow already the v - modell xt have now simple means to also incorporate the analytical model into their process .",
    "( 2 ) it has been shown that such an integration can be done relatively simple and with little effort .",
    "therefore , this should be also possible with other process models and hence the usage of models of qa can be increased .    for future work , we consider tool support as the other important aspect of pushing the use of such models in software organisations .",
    "hence , we plan to build an easy to use tool implementation that helps in applying the model .",
