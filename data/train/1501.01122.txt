    "after appropriate background subtraction , spectra from all the detectors were fitted simultaneously in 0.8 - 70 kev energy range using xspec v12.7 package . due to the presence of known si and au edge feature in xis spectra , data in 1.7 - 1.9 kev and 2.2 - 2.4 kev energy ranges were ignored in the spectral fitting .",

    "variation of iron emission line flux and equivalent width with hard x - ray continuum flux ( 8 - 70 kev ) in 4u  1700 - 37 are found to be similar to that found in lmx  x-4 and her  x-1 ( naik & paul 2003 ) . in case of lmc  x-4 and her  x-1 ,",
    "the change in iron line parameters with continuum flux was interpreted as due to the presence of precessing tilted accretion disk causing modification in the geometry and visibility of iron line emitting region in the binary systems . to investigate the geometry in 4u  1700 - 37 binary system , we plotted the equivalent widths of 6.4 kev and 7.1 kev iron lines with the observed column density in figure  [ eqw - nh ] .",

    "in such configuration , the x - ray source is expected to be surround by inhomogeneously distributed absorbing material that covers a fraction of radiation along the line of sight .",
    "the continuum x - ray emission in the neutron star x - ray binaries is understood to be emitted through the inverse comptonization of the photons originated from the magnetic poles as well as within the accretion column of the neutron star ( becker & wolff 2007 ) .",
    "the emitted photons interact with the materials present in the surroundings of the neutron star .",
    "the effect of interactions can be seen in the observed spectrum in the form of photo - electric absorption , soft excess emission , line emissions and cyclotron absorption features .",
    "detection of soft excess and line emissions can reflect the reprocessing of hard x - ray photons with matter ( neutral or ionized plasma ) in accretion disk , accretion column etc .",
    "the effect of the neutron star magnetic field can be seen in the x - ray spectrum through the interaction of quantized electrons with the source photons .",

    "observation did not provide any concluding results , the presence of weak absorption - like feature at @xmath139 kev in both the cases can not be entirely ruled out .",
    "assuming the detected feature as crsf in 4u  1700 - 37 , the magnetic field of the x - ray source ( neutron star ) in the binary system was estimated to be @xmath13.4@xmath210@xmath3  gauss .",
    "the presence of the cyclotron feature can be confirmed by using data from future observations with long exposure and good hard x - ray spectroscopic instruments such as @xmath54 , @xmath55 & @xmath56 missions .",
    "4u  1700 - 37 was found to be significantly variable during the @xmath0 observation .",
    "such kind of flux variability are seen in other wind - accreting high mass x - ray binaries such as vela  x-1 ( kreykenbohm et al .",

    "the source luminosity in these wind - fed systems depends on the density and velocity of stellar wind as @xmath57 ( bondi & hoyle 1944 ) .",
    "any fluctuations either in density or velocity can produce the variation in luminosity .",
    "flux variability in time scales of kilo - seconds as seen in 4u  1700 - 37 , were seen in vela  x-1 and was explained on the basis of clumpy wind with the fluctuating density causing variation in the accretion rate ( kreykenbohm et al .",
    "2008 ; odaka et al .",
    "presence of low and high flux levels were also seen in the pulsar 4u  1907 + 09 during @xmath0 observations in 2006 and 2007 ( rivers et al .",
    "though the low flux levels were present in the light curves of both the observations , the one present in 2006 observation was consistent with earlier observations of 4u  1907 + 09 and interpreted as due to change in whole continuum rather than obscuration / absorption of x - rays due to the presence of additional matter as in later case ( rivers et al .",
    "the argument of presence of clump of matter causing low flux levels in the light curves during 2007 observation was supported by the enhancement in the value of absorption column density along the line of sight . however , in the present study , the variation of n@xmath49 was marginal during flare and non - flare durations .",
    "significantly high value of n@xmath49 after orbital phase @xmath10.6 compared to rest of the segments of the _ suzaku _ observation confirmed the finding from _ exosat _ observation of the source .",
    "this high n@xmath49 value segment ( beyond orbital phase of @xmath10.6 ) was interpreted as due to the passage of the accretion wake between the neutron star and the observer .",
    "as the neutron star moves away , the accretion wake which trails behind the neutron star during the whole orbit , crosses the line of sight of the observer at @xmath10.6 orbital phase yielding significantly high value of absorption column density .",
    "taam & fryxell ( 1989 ) performed the simulation to understand the interaction between asymmetric accretion flow from ob stars onto the neutron stars .",
    "the results showed that a temporary disk can be formed during the interaction of accretion flow with the shock in accretion wake region .",
    "the destruction of temporary accretion disk is associated with the reversal of storage accretion flow that increases the mass accretion rate .",
    "the flow reversal occurs in the range of few hours that generates the flares of 15 m to 1 hr time scales as seen in several segments ( such as 3 , 4 , 7 , 10 etc . ) of present suzaku observation .",
    "the `` flip - flop instability '' in the accretion disk can possibly also explain short time flaring activities as observed in 4u  1700 - 37 ( matsuda et al .",
    "however , in an alternate scenario , the hydrodynamics simulation results for wind - fed sources showed the formation of non - steady accretion wake consisting the dense filaments of compressed gas where the density reaches @xmath1100 times more compared to undisturbed stellar wind ( blondin et al .",
    "accretion of these filaments with fluctuating density may generate the abrupt variation in the x - ray luminosity as observed in the present case .",
    "@xmath0 observation of 4u  1700 - 37 was taken during out of eclipse of binary .",
    "however , an eclipse - like low flux segment was observed towards the end of the observation in 0.63 - 0.73 orbital phase range . during this segment ,",
    "an increase in column density was found .",
    "the source flux and line flux of both the iron emission lines were decreased to minimum values compared to the rest of the observation .",
    "the presence of dense matter in this orbital phase range can be the possible reason for the eclipse like segments . such type of eclipse - like segments ( quiescence period ) was also observed during @xmath23 observation of 4u  1700 - 37 around @xmath10.68 orbital phase ( boroson et al .",
    "a significant increase in the column density after phase 0.5 was also reported earlier during the @xmath58 observation of 4u  1700 - 37 ( mason et al .",
    "1976 ) . during @xmath21 observation ,",
    "an increasing column density was also noticed after 0.6 orbital phase of the binary ( haberl et al .",
    "the sharp increase in the column density at above orbital phase range can be interpreted as the formation of accretion wake as observed in vela  x-1 ( blondin et al . 1990 ) .",
    "haberl et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also reported the presence of accretion wake based on the temperature difference observed in the soft excess component .",
    "however , the spectroscopic evidences confirmed the formation of accretion wake at late orbital phases of binary that blocks the continuum and produces the eclipse like segments ( kaper et al .",
    "1994 ) which is seen in the present case of 4u  1700 - 37 .    in summary",
    ", the observed flux variability at ks time scale during @xmath0 observation of 4u  1700 - 37 can be explained on clumpiness in the stellar wind which may cause fluctuation in mass accretion rate .",
    "however , the instability in temporary disk or flip flop instability in accretion disk can also produce the flares on short time intervals as seen in light curves between 0.29 - 0.63 orbital phase .",
    "the extended low flux eclipse - like segment observed towards the end of the observation is interpreted as due to the presence of accretion wake .",
