    "the study of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) constitutes one of the most powerful tools of cosmology , providing us with very valuable information about the origin and evolution of the universe .",
    "in particular , the determination of the cmb power spectrum allows one to put tight constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , the study of the cmb temperature distribution provides us with a powerful test of the standard inflationary theory , since this predicts that the cmb fluctuations should follow a homogeneous and isotropic gaussian distribution whereas alternative theories  such as non - standard inflation @xcite or topological defects @xcite  give rise to non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "given the interest of the subject , a large number of techniques have been proposed for studying the gaussianity and isotropy of the cmb including , among others , the minkowski functionals ( @xcite ) , the bispectrum ( @xcite ) , properties of hot and cold spots ( @xcite ) , geometrical estimators ( @xcite ) , extrema correlation function ( @xcite ) , wavelet analysis @xcite , bipolar power spectrum @xcite , phase analysis ( @xcite ) and goodness of fit tests @xcite .",
    "many non - gaussianity analyses have been performed using the best cmb data available up to date , which have been provided by the nasa wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the wmap team carried out a study of the cmb temperature distribution of the first year data @xcite finding that the data were consistent with gaussianity .",
    "however , in subsequent works , a number of unexpected results regarding the gaussianity and/or isotropy of the cmb were reported , including anomalies related to low multipoles @xcite , north / south asymmetries @xcite , a cold spot in the southern hemisphere @xcite , structure alignment @xcite , phase correlations @xcite and to the amplitude of hot and cold spots @xcite .",
    "after the release of the three - year wmap data in march 2006 , similar analyses have been carried out confirming the presence of the anomalies in the data @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we report a new anomaly in the wmap data : a significantly low value of the cmb variance with respect to the one expected for the wmap best - fit model .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : tests ] several quantities related to the one - point density function ( 1-pdf ) are studied for the wmap data , including the dispersion , skewness , kurtosis and kolmogorov - smirnov distance . in  [ sec : sigma0 ] the cmb dispersion from the wmap data is estimated , finding that its value is significantly low .",
    "the effect on our results of possible residual foregrounds or systematics are studied in  [ sec:4 ] . in  [ sec : explanations ] possible explanations for the anomaly are discussed , including the modification of the cosmological parameters and a deviation of the cmb from gaussianity and/or isotropy .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the nasa wmap satellite was launched in the summer of 2001 .",
    "the first - year and three - years results were presented in february 2003 and march 2006 respectively .",
    "wmap observes at five frequency bands : k ( 22.8 ghz , one receiver ) , ka ( 33.0 ghz , one receiver ) , q ( 40.7 ghz , two receivers ) , v ( 60.8 ghz , two receivers ) and w ( 93.5 ghz , four receivers ) .",
    "all the data and products generated by wmap can be found at the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) web site .    following the wmap team ( @xcite )",
    "we have performed our non - gaussianity analyses on a noise weighted average of the q , v and w receivers , which provides a cmb map where the signal - to - noise ratio has been increased .",
    "the k and ka receivers are not included in the combined map since they are largely contaminated by galactic foregrounds .",
    "in addition , the wmap team has reduced the galactic contamination present in the q , v and w map by performing a foreground template fit as described in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the combined q+v+w map is constructed using these clean data as ( @xcite ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 gives the position in the sky and the index @xmath3 correspond to the different receivers of the q , v and w bands ( i.e. , the indices 3 to 10 refer to the q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 , w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 radiometers respectively ) . the noise weight @xmath4 is defined as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the noise dispersion per observation for each radiometer given by @xcite and @xmath7 is the number of observations made by the receiver @xmath3 at the position in the sky @xmath8 .",
    "although the data are provided at a healpix @xcite resolution of @xmath9 , we degrade the data down to @xmath10 since the smallest scales are dominated by noise . in addition , in order to avoid the strong contamination present at the galactic plane and the emission coming from extragalactic point sources , only the data outside the wmap kp0 mask @xcite , which corresponds approximately to 76 per cent of the sky , has been used .",
    "finally , the monopole and dipole outside the kp0 mask have been removed .    in order to apply our gaussianity test",
    ", we construct the normalised temperature @xmath11 , which is obtained by dividing the data at each pixel by its corresponding expected dispersion . since the contribution from residual foregrounds in the clean wmap combined map outside the kp0 is expected to be very small , the main contribution to the data dispersion comes from the cmb signal and the instrumental noise .",
    "the wmap noise is very well approximated by gaussian white noise at each pixel characterised by a dispersion @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the normalised temperature is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the cmb dispersion is constant over the sky .",
    "however , strictly speaking , there is a small dependence of @xmath14 with the position in the wmap combined map due to the different beams and noise weights used in the combination .",
    "nonetheless , these differences are very small and one can assume , to a very good approximation , that the signal dispersion is constant over the sky . ] and has been estimated as @xmath15 the @xmath16 s in the previous equation correspond to the power spectrum of the combined map assuming the best - fit modelcdm model using only wmap data  given in the first version of the papers of the three - year wmap data realease ( @xcite , see table 5 of arxiv : astro - ph/0603449v1 ) .",
    "although the values of the cosmological parameters have been slightly modified in the final version of the wmap papers , we have tested that these small changes do not affect the results of this work . ] to the wmap data and taking into account the different beams and noise weights used in the combination ( see appendix [ ap : cl_comb_teo ] ) .",
    "the maximum @xmath17 that we have considered is @xmath18 .    if the data follow a gaussian distribution  and our assumptions about the underlying cosmological model and the instrumental noise are correct ",
    "the normalised temperature @xmath19 should follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit dispersion n(0,1 ) .",
    "we have calculated different estimators for the normalised data outside the kp0 mask : dispersion , skewness and kurtosis .",
    "in addition , the data have been compared to a n(0,1 ) distribution through a kolmogorov - smirnov test . in order to assign a significance to these quantities ,",
    "the same analysis has been applied to 1000 gaussian simulations of the wmap combined data . to reproduce the data as closely as possible ,",
    "the simulations have been generated at resolution @xmath20=512 for each radiometer and then processed in the same way as the data to obtain the simulated combined maps .",
    "results are shown in table [ tab:1pdf_3yr_results ] .",
    ".[tab:1pdf_3yr_results ] the dispersion , skewness , kurtosis and kolmogorov - smirnov distance d@xmath21 are given for the normalised wmap data as well as for the northern and southern ecliptic hemispheres ( in all cases considering only pixels outside the kp0 mask ) .",
    "the significance of each quantity has been calculated from 1000 gaussian realisations as the percentage of simulations with a value larger or equal to that obtained from the data . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to find this model , we have carried out the following analysis .",
    "first we have selected a number ( around 20 ) of sets of values of @xmath22 which are contained in the most probable 68 per cent of the 3-dimensional likelihood previously constructed for these parameters .",
    "for each of these sets , we have then run cosmomc @xcite in order to find the best - fit to the wmap data , with @xmath23 , @xmath0 and @xmath24 fixed for each set , varying the rest of the cosmological parameters . from all the considered models , we find that the one that best fits the wmap power spectrum has the values given in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the value of the spectral index is higher ( @xmath25 ) for the new model .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : models ] the model fits reasonably well the power spectrum and the main difference can be found at low @xmath17 s where the new model ( red dashed line ) goes below the wmap best - fit ( black solid line ) , which would tend to give a smaller variance . in particular , we find that the estimated variance has a theoretical significance of 93.1 per cent for this new model ( to be compared with 99.3 found for the wmap best - fit ) and therefore the cmb variance is not so significantly low in this case",
    ".        therefore , this seems to indicate that the low value of the cmb dispersion found in the wmap data could be made compatible with the model , while keeping a reasonable fit to the power spectrum , by varying the cosmological parameters . in addition",
    ", we would like to point out again that we have considered only a restricted set of models and if the whole set of cosmological parameters were allowed to vary simultaneously , it is likely that we would find models that would fit better both the estimated variance and the power spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , a more exhaustive study where a wider range of models were considered would be necessary to confirm this result .",
    "a deviation of the cmb from gaussianity and/or isotropy could also explain the inconsistency found between the estimated cmb variance and the considered model .",
    "moreover , this possibility is also supported by the fact that different authors have claimed the presence of departures from gaussianity and/or isotropy in the wmap data ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) .    one possible way to test the gaussianity and isotropy of the cmb is to perform a consistency test of the data using equation ( [ eq : cmb_disp ] ) , that relates the cmb variance and the power spectrum .",
    "gaussianity and isotropy have been assumed to estimate both , the cmb variance and the wmap power spectrum .",
    "therefore , if these assumptions are valid , both results should be consistent .    to perform this test , we have used the actual measured power spectrum of the wmap data , i.e. the power spectrum estimated for the particular realization of the cmb sky , instead of the best - fit model . from these @xmath26 s , we have calculated the power spectrum that we expect for the wmap combined map ( using the results of appendix  [ ap : cl_comb_teo ] ) .",
    "finally , we have calculated the value of the cmb variance from equation ( [ eq : cmb_disp ] ) using this power spectrum of the combined map . in this way",
    ", we find a value for the dispersion of @xmath27 mk . the error associated to this quantity",
    "is expected to be small , since the main contribution to the variance is due to the low multipoles , which are almost unaffected by the instrumental noise .",
    "this value should be compared to @xmath28 mk , the dispersion that we have previously estimated from the combined map .",
    "the difference between these two estimations indicates the presence of an inconsistency in the data between the measured power spectrum and the estimated variance .",
    "to study further this possibility we have also calculated the theoretical significance of our estimated cmb variance from equation ( [ eq : signif_laura ] ) , using again the power spectrum of the wmap combined map constructed from the actual measured wmap power spectrum ( instead of the best - fit model as done in ",
    "[ sec : sigma0 ] ) . in this case",
    ", we find a value of 96.0 per cent for the significance .",
    "moreover , if we remove the quadrupole from the data ( as explained in ",
    "[ sec : sigma0 ] ) , the significance increases to 99.5 per cent , when removing the quadrupole , the significance of the variance decreased ( unlike in the current analysis ) .",
    "this makes sense , since the quadrupole of the data is known to be significantly lower than that of the best - fit model , and therefore removing the quadrupole from the analysis would make the variance more consistent with the best - fit model .",
    "however , in the current analysis , we are comparing the estimated cmb variance with the actual measured power spectrum of the wmap data , where the quadrupole is also low and , therefore , removing the quadrupole , does not necessarily increase the consistency . ] .",
    "this points out again towards an inconsistency between the estimated values of the variance and those of the power spectrum in the wmap data ( independently of the best - fit model ) .",
    "in addition , it also shows that the anomaly is present at multipoles higher than the quadrupole .",
    "therefore , a deviation from gaussianity and/or isotropy of the wmap data could be the reason for the inconsistency found between the estimated variance and the considered model .",
    "moreover , taking into account the results of  [ sec:4 ] , that show that the anomalously low variance can not be explained by known systematics or foregrounds ( and assuming that the estimated cmb power spectrum is neither affected by spurious signals ) , a cosmological origin for this deviation from gaussianity and/or isotropy can not be discarded .",
    "we have studied the normalised temperature distribution of the cmb using the wmap data , finding that the skewness , kurtosis and the kolmogorov - smirnov test are consistent with gaussianity . however , the dispersion was significantly lower ( at the level of 97.8 per cent ) than expected from cmb simulations using the wmap best - fit power spectrum .",
    "this result was even more significant when only the northern ecliptic sky was considered ( at 99.4 per cent ) .",
    "in oder to clarify this point , a more detailed analysis of the cmb dispersion of the wmap data has been performed . in particular , we have estimated this dispersion to be @xmath29 mk , which is again anomalously low ( 98.7 per cent of the gaussian cmb simulations have a larger value of the dispersion ) .",
    "if only the northern ecliptic hemisphere is considered , the significance increases to 99.8 per cent , whereas the southern ecliptic hemisphere is compatible with the simulations .",
    "we have repeated our analysis using single radiometer and single year maps , finding that the significance of the low variance is practically frequency independent and that it can not be explained by an anomalous radiometer or by an artifact in a single year data .",
    "in addition , the presence of residual foregrounds or 1/f noise can not explain the low value of the cmb dispersion , since they would tend to shift @xmath30 towards higher values .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of varying the cosmological parameters in the significance of the estimated variance .",
    "in particular , searching within a restricted number of models , we have fround one case that provides a reasonable fit to the wmap power spectrum and for which the signficance of the estimated variance decreases to 93.0 per cent .",
    "this seems to indicate that is possible to find a model that is consistent with both the estimated variance and the measured power spectrum of the wmap data , especially if a wider range of cosmological models is considered .",
    "nevertheless , a more exhaustive study is necessary to confirm this result .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that the cmb variance tends to favour higher values of the spectral index than the full - power spectrum analysis of the wmap data .",
    "finally , we have considered the possibility that a deviation from gaussianity and/or isotropy could be the reason for the anomalous variance .",
    "we find that there is an inconsistency between the estimated cmb variance and the actual measured power spectrum of the wmap data , independently of the best - fit model .",
    "this indicates that a deviation from gaussianity and/or isotropy could be a possible explanation for the found anomaly .",
    "moreover , taking into account that known systematics or foregrounds can not explain the anomalously low cmb variance , a cosmological origin for this possible deviation can not be discarded .",
