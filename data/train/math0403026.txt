    "the problem of detecting fiberedness ( or non - fiberedness ) of knots , has been studied considerably from both the algebraic and the geometric topology viewpoint .",
    "the classical alexander polynomial of a fibered knot is known to be _ monic _ and this provides an effective criterion for detecting fibered knots .",

    "a geometric procedure to detect fibered knots was developed by gabai in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new criterion for detecting non - fibered knots when the alexander polynomial fails , and to present several applications of this criterion .",

    "the notion of knot adjacency was studied in @xcite and the theory was further developed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite we showed that high degree adjacency ( @xmath6 ) to fibered knots imposes strong restrictions on the knot genus . in this paper , we explore the role of knot adjacency as obstruction to fiberdness .",
    "we show that when the alexander polynomial provides inconclusive evidence , high degree knot adjacencies obstruct knots to be fibered .",

    "we give a systematic procedure that constructs vast families of such knots .",
