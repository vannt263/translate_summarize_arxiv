    "the icecube neutrino observatory will be composed of a deep array of 86 strings holding 5,160 digital optical modules ( doms ) deployed between 1.45 and 2.45 km below the surface of the south pole ice and a surface array , icetop , for extensive air shower measurements on the composition and spectrum of cosmic rays ( crs ) .",

    "unlike gamma and proton astronomy , neutrino astronomy can access the entire universe , probe cosmological sources and sources opaque to photons .",
    "neutrino and proton astronomy are still not established since no 5-@xmath14 level evidence of a signal has yet been observed , while tev gamma astronomy is entering the time in which astronomical information is enabling physics interpretation .",
    "proton astronomy is limited to the observation of less than about 100  mpc by interactions of protons on the microwave background that above about @xmath18  ev result in delta - resonance production .",
    "the observation of the drop off of the spectrum of ultra - high energy cr ( uhecrs ) above these energies is compatible with such a mechanism @xcite .",
    "the results on the composition are less clear and hint to a heavier component than pure protons in the uhecr flux .",
    "the minimum energy at which proton astronomy is possible is highly uncertain due to the incapability of calculating exactly proton deflections in the intergalactic and galactic magnetic fields .",
    "if uhecrs are heavy nuclei dominated , probably fe deflections would be too high to allow astronomy at all .",
    "one way to understand the uhecr composition is to look for neutrinos in coincidence with uhecrs possibly coming from common sources .",
    "in fact , if such correlation would be observed the composition must be proton dominated .",
    "the correlation between the 22-string icecube neutrino events and the highest energy events in auger and hires used for astronomy studies has been investigated in @xcite providing a p - value of 1% to occur as a random fluctuation of the background .",

    "the signal and background from the uhecr directions is stacked and a tolerance value of @xmath19 around these directions is included to account for possible unknown magnetic filed deflections of uhecrs .    while the main limitation for proton astronomy is the uncertainty on magnetic fields and the proton interactions with photon backgrounds , the main challenges for neutrino astronomy are due to the interactions of neutrinos and to the atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds .",
    "weak interactions make neutrinos unique probes to observe the far away universe and the inner part of sources from which photons or protons can not escape , but they also require cubic - km scale detectors and beyond .",
    "the generic neutrino and cr source can be envisaged as an engine that accelerates protons , and magnetic fields in the accelerated region confine them .",
    "if protons attain sufficient energy , they can interact with radiation and produce neutrons that can escape the accelerating region without interacting .",
    "subsequently , neutron decay can give rise to the observed cosmic ray flux , gamma rays , and yet unobserved neutrinos .",

    "this hints to active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) as best candidate sources for the uhecrs and so for neutrinos coming from their interactions .",

    "the limit also assumes that magnetic fields in the universe do not affect the observed cr spectrum .",
    "it has been divided by a factor of 2 to account for neutrino oscillations .",
    "the upper bound applies as well to @xmath24 interactions since it is likely that the energy fraction of protons transferred to pions is even less than for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the wb limit could be much higher at lower energies than @xmath25 ev assuming a 10% contribution from an extragalactic source of protons on top of the measured galactic component but experimental limits exclude this option .",
    "it should be noted that if the injected cr spectrum from extragalactic sources includes heavy nuclei , then the upper bound and the cosmogenic neutrino fluxes @xcite would be lower than for the assumed proton case @xcite .",

    "it can as well severely constrain the parameter space of models of neutrino production in agns normalized to the observations of auger assuming that the uhecrs come from a class of nearby agns , as shown in ref .  @xcite .",

    "instrumental systematic errors are now estimated at the level of 20% dominated by the ice description and the dom efficiency .",
    "another important factor under investigation is the effect of the cr composition and of hadronic models .",
    "an unbinned likelihood ( lh ) method that compares the signal and the signal plus atmospheric muon and neutrino background hypotheses has been applied to look for emissions of neutrinos from point like sources .",
    "the method uses the reconstructed error on the direction and an energy proxy based on the estimate of the photon density along a muon track .",
    "events would cluster around their source ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) and the neutrino signal from sources is expected to have a harder spectrum ( @xmath29 ) compared to atmospheric muons and neutrinos produced in the meson decays in atmospheric showers ( @xmath30 for @xmath31  gev ) .",

    "<S> understanding cosmic acceleration mechanisms , such as jet formation in black holes , star collapses or binary mergers , and the propagation of accelerated particles in the universe is still a ` work in progress ' and requires a multi - messenger approach , exploiting the complementarities across all possible probes : ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , gamma - rays and neutrinos . in this report </S>",
    "<S> i will summarize some of the icecube results concerning searches for astrophysical neutrino point sources and diffuse fluxes from populations of sources widely distributed in the sky or from the interactions of protons on the cosmic microwave background producing the gzk cut - off in the cosmic ray spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> i will compare the results to other neutrino telescopes and to astrophysical models of neutrino production in sources . </S>",
    "<S> another unresolved question concerns the nature of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> indirect searches have the opportunity to observe where it is located in the universe through the observation of secondary photons , neutrinos or antiparticles such as positrons and antiprotons . the potential for the search of neutrinos from the annihilation of wimps in icecube is greatly enhanced by the addition of more compact strings , the deepcore . </S>"
