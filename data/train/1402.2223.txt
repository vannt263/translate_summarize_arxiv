    "this effect is well understood in the case of ferromagnetic models , see for example @xcite , but few rigorous results are known in the literature for spin glasses to our knowledge .",
    "second , the model gives a non - trivial example of a solvable spin glass where the ( by now ) standard approaches such as talagrand s cavity method @xcite or guerra s interpolation scheme @xcite can not be applied . to overcome this obstacle",
    ", we resort to the classical tools of large deviations , and to a _ conditional second moment method_. this approach allows to derive a complete picture of the phase transition up to the level of the fluctuations of the ground states .",
    "the model may thus shed some light on the connections at the microcanonical level between the standard treatment of statistical mechanics models _  la gibbs _ and the successful parisi approach based on the ultrametric structure of the gibbs measure , see @xcite for a review of the rigorous results in mean - field models .",

    "the formula for the free energy was first obtained by de oliveira filho , da costa and yokoi @xcite .",
    "our contribution is to rigorously back their argument using large deviation techniques .",
    "the idea is that the random field energy density @xmath17 satisfies a large deviation principle ( ldp ) with rate function @xmath18 conditionally on @xmath19 by the grtner - ellis theorem , cf .",
