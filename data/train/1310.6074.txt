    "the negative binomial distribution is widely used in biology to model the counts of individuals in populations , since such counts are frequently overdispersed , making the poisson distribution an unsuitable choice .",
    "indeed , the main advantage of the negative binomial family over the poisson family is the extra flexibility in fitting that results because the negative binomial family has a second parameter .",
    "however , for the distribution of parasites among hosts , there are plausible mechanistic models @xcite that predict a negative binomial distribution , and it is of interest to know whether a member of the negative binomial family would still give a reasonable approximation , if the detailed assumptions of such a model were relaxed .",
    "one of the quantities of primary interest is then the total rate of output of infective stages , which can be expected to be closely related to the total number of parasites in the population @xcite .",
    "thus the approximation needs to be good when measured by a distance that limits the differences in expectation of ( not necessarily bounded ) lipschitz functionals , which makes the wasserstein metric a natural choice . in this paper",
