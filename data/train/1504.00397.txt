    "when categorical data arise from individuals classified into groups of individuals or cluster of objects , the major issue is that observations within a cluster are not independent and the conventional methods of inference for multinomial sampling , are inappropriate .",
    "the strength of similarity of two observations within a cluster is typically measured by the intracluster correlation coefficient , whereas observations from separate clusters are regarded as independent . in most situations",
    ", the intracluster correlation tends to be positive and this induces that the variances of the counts under clustered sampling to be greater than the ones under multinomial sampling , namely extra variation with respect to the multinomial sampling ( for the technical details , see page ) .",

    "it is well - known that the kullback - leibler divergence is a particular case of the so - called phi - divergence measures between the probability vectors @xmath110 and @xmath95 , given by@xmath123 more thoroughly , taking @xmath124 ( [ 6 ] ) is the kullback - leibler divergence between @xmath110 and @xmath31 . for more details about phi - divergence measures",
    "see pardo ( 2006 ) .",

    "the following definition shows that the phi - divergences , given in ( [ 6 ] ) , are also useful for the general case of @xmath129 . unlike the multinomial sampling ( @xmath125 ) , for clustered multinomial log - linear models ( @xmath128 ) the knowledge of the shape of the moments , given in ( [ moments2 ] ) , is only assumed .",
    "since no underlying distribution is being assumed and only mild assumptions on the first two moments of a distribution are taken into account , the estimator of @xmath29 is termed quasi minimum @xmath130-divergence estimator  of @xmath29 ( in the sequel , qm@xmath94e ) , defined for the first time for a more general setting in vos ( 1992 ) .",
    "[ defmin]we consider a statistical model verifying ( [ moments2 ] ) .",
    "the qm@xmath94e of @xmath29 , @xmath131 , is defined as @xmath132 where @xmath133 , the phi - divergence measure between the probability vectors @xmath110 and @xmath24 ,  is given by ( [ 6 ] ) .    from a practical point of view , in order to find the quasi minimum @xmath94 divergence estimator of @xmath29 for clustered multinomial log - linear models , we have to solve the following system of equations@xmath134 where @xmath135,@xmath136 this expression arises from considering@xmath137 these equations are nonlinear functions of the unknown parameter , @xmath29 .",
    "in order to solve these equations numerically the newton - raphson method is used , in such a way that the @xmath138th - step estimate , @xmath139 , is obtained from @xmath140 as @xmath141 where @xmath142 with@xmath143@xmath144 it is worthwhile of mentioning that the quasi maximum  likelihood estimators ( qmle ) , introduced by wedderburn ( 1974 ) , are very useful for clustered multinomial models , in particular for multinomial log - linear models .",
    "the qmles of @xmath29 are obtained by solving the system of non - linear equations ( [ eq ] ) with @xmath145 given by ( [ phikull ] ) , i.e. , @xmath146 and the expression of these estimators match the ones of the minimum kullback - leibler divergence estimators given in ( [ kull ] ) .",
    "hence , the qm@xmath94es are generalizations of the qmles , for clustered multinomial log - linear models .    under the assumption that the @xmath147 exists , newton - raphson method tends always to converge with any initialization or guess of parameters .",
    "however , for some samples , such as contingency tables with outlying cells or high - dimensional parameters , @xmath148 , can be quite flat and can create troubles related to precision , even with no null frequencies .",
    "such problems are related to hessian matrices near to be singular .",
    "in addition , if the @xmath147 fails to exist , the algorithm does not converge , since the hessian matrix of @xmath149 becomes iteratively to being singular .",
    "the newton - raphson method converges in general in few iterations , but is convenient to begin properly the iterative process with the weighted least squares method of fitting log - linear models ( grizzle , stramer and koch ( 1969 ) ) , i.e. taking @xmath150 with @xmath151 and removing from it @xmath152 , the independent term .",
    "a count of @xmath153 is problematic , so one could set @xmath154 .    in order to ensure an algorithm with proper convergence properties in both cases at the same time , with zero frequencies or not , there are several possibilities .",
    "quasi - newton and conjugate gradient methods require only evaluating gradients , being quasi - newton methods faster but more storage demanding . for this reason , we have applied in the simulation study the fortran ` nag ` subroutine ` c05pbf ` , which is based on a modified version of the powell s hybrid algorithm , a combination of quasi - newton and conjugate gradient methods .",
    "it is also worth of mentioning that the derivative free algorithms ( nelder - mead , hooke - jeeves , torczon ) constitute a robust choice with respect to the initial point , and could be particularly useful for contingency tables with outlying cells .",
