    "the study of multilinear pseudodifferential operators goes back to the pioneering works of r.  coifman and y.  meyer , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since then , there has been a large amount of work on various generalisations of their results , as well as studies of bilinear operators with symbols satisfying different conditions to those in the standard bilinear coifman - meyer classes .",
    "the literature in this area of research is vast and any brief summary of it here would not do the authors justice .",
    "therefore we confine ourselves to mention only those works with a direct connection to the present paper .",
    "r.  coifman and y.  meyer , in @xcite and @xcite , proved the boundedness from @xmath2 to @xmath3 of multilinear pseudodifferential operators with symbols in the class @xmath4 ( see definition [ bilinear multiplier defn ] below ) for @xmath5 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 . in the seminal paper @xcite , l.  grafakos and r.  torres systematically developed the theory of multilinear caldern - zygmund operators .",
    "they proved a multilinear @xmath8-theorem which they applied to generalise the result above to @xmath9 .",
    "as a further application , they demonstrated the boundedness in lebesgue spaces of multilinear pseudodifferential operators which , together with each of the adjoint operators , belonged to @xmath10 ( see definition [ def4 ] ) .",
    "however , in @xcite , a.  bnyi and r.  torres showed that there exist symbols in @xmath11 that do not give rise to bilinear operators which are bounded from @xmath12 to @xmath3 for @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , there is no analogue of the caldern - vaillancourt theorem in the bilinear setting .",
    "moreover , the class of operators @xmath15 is not closed under transposition . in contrast , @xcite demonstrates that @xmath16 is closed under transposition .",
    "recently , in @xcite , a.  bnyi , d.  maldonado , v.  naibo and r.  torres proved that @xmath17 is closed under transposition for @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in particular , given an operator in @xmath20 , its adjoints are also in @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath21 , it follows that symbols in @xmath22 give rise to bounded operators , by applying the result of @xcite quoted above .    in summary",
    ", we see that @xmath23 are bounded on appropriate lebesgue spaces when @xmath24 ( that is , the caldern - zygmund case ) , but in general they fail to be bounded when @xmath25 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address the following question , which is of interest for @xmath26 in - between these values , ` given @xmath27 , what @xmath28 is sufficient to ensure that symbols in @xmath29 give rise to bounded operators ? '",
    "this question is in the spirit of questions asked in @xcite .",
    "we will study this question for two different symbol classes .",
    "first , in section [ main1 ] , we will consider a larger symbol class which does not require any differentiability in the spatial variable at all .",
    "that is , we study the multilinear symbol class @xmath30 ( see definition [ def2 ] ) which , in particular , contains @xmath29 for any @xmath31 .",
    "our main result in this context is theorem [ multi_one ] , which generalises a result obtained by the present authors in @xcite regarding the linear case .",
    "the study of such symbol classes originates in @xcite , where c.  kenig and the third author studied linear operators . in the context of multilinear operators ,",
    "results regarding mildly regular bilinear operators have been proved previously . in particular ,",
    "d.  maldonado and v.  naibo established in @xcite boundedness properties of bilinear pseudodifferential operators on products of weighted lebesgue , hardy , and amalgam spaces .",
    "the regularity they require in the spatial variables is only that of dini - type .",
    "section [ mixed norms ] deals with linear operators on mixed - norm lebesgue spaces , and is a corollary to the proof of theorem [ multi_one ] .",
    "the second topic we will study is the bilinear symbol class @xmath32 . in section [ lpsmrho and applications ]",
    "we adapt methods used to study symbols in @xmath30 to weaken the requirement on @xmath33 necessary to prove boundedness on lebesgue spaces of operators in @xmath17 for @xmath34 .",
    "this is formulated as theorem [ smooth pseudo bilinear ] . in section [ outwith ] , although we can not show boundedness for general operators arising from symbols in @xmath35 , we can prove boundedness on a suitable subclass .",
    "this is stated as theorem [ modulationtype ] , which is a result of the same flavour as that proved by f.  bernicot and s.  shrivastava in @xcite regarding a subclass of @xmath36 , albeit proved by more straight - forward methods .",
    "a related result regarding @xmath37 was also proved in @xcite .",
    "we begin the main body of the paper with section [ prelim ] where we set out some definitions , fix some notation and recall some well - known results that we will use later .",
    "we study the following type of _ multilinear pseudodifferential operator_. given a function @xmath38 we define the @xmath39-linear operator @xmath40 to act on @xmath39 functions @xmath41 belonging to the schwartz class @xmath42 as @xmath43 here @xmath44 are all variables in @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 denotes the fourier transform @xmath48 of @xmath49 .",

    "although the integral in may not be absolutely convergent for @xmath41 which do not decay sufficiently rapidly , if we can prove bounds on the operator norm which depend only on @xmath99 and @xmath50 , then it is a straight - forward exercise to show that @xmath40 has a unique extension to @xmath94 which agrees with for @xmath100 .",
