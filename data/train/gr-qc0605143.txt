    "astronomical data show that the expansion of our universe is accelerated at the present epoch @xcite . assuming that the universe is filled with perfect fluids , the equation of state parameter @xmath1 must satisfy @xmath2 , indicating a negative pressure .",
    "many theories have been proposed to study the origin of this negative pressure or repulsive gravitational behavior .",
    "one of these theories introduces a smooth energy component with negative pressure dubbed `` dark energy '' . a candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant @xcite : a constant quantum vacuum energy density which fills the space homogeneously , corresponding to a fluid with a constant equation of state parameter @xmath0 .",
    "because of conceptual problems associated with the cosmological constant , such as fine - tuning and coincidence problems @xcite , alternative theories have been proposed where in a class of them , some dynamical scalar fields , with suitably chosen potentials , have been introduced to make the vacuum energy vary with time @xcite .",
    "for example to describe @xmath3 phase or quintessence regime , a normal scalar field @xmath4 , known as quintessence scalar field , can be used @xcite . for performing actual calculation ,",
    "it is useful to assume that the quintessence field is slowly rolling in a potential .",
    "this approximation ( slow - roll ) , leads to inflationary expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 phase ( or phantom phase ) can be related to the presence of a scalar field @xmath6 , with a wrong sign kinetic term dubbed as phantom scalar field @xcite .",
    "depending on the form of the potential , different solutions such as asymptotic de sitter , big rip , etc .",
    "may be obtained @xcite .",
    "the effects of gravitational back - reactions can also counteract that of phantom energy and can become large enough to end the phantom dominated phase before the big rip @xcite .",
    "one of the important issues of the scalar models of dark energy is their stability behaviors in both the classical and quantum mechanical levels . in classical level ,",
    "one of the main methods of stability studies is achieved by studying the stability of the late - time attractors of the theory by a phase space analysis .",
    "this can be done by determining the eigenvalues of the determinant obtained by the set of autonomous equations of motion when perturbed about their critical points .",
    "variety of models have been studied by this method , which some of them can be found in @xcite and references therein .    the second kind of instabilities , which is more important in phantom models , are those based on the quantum fluctuations . because the phantom fields have negative kinetic energy , it is possible that a phantom particle decays into arbitrary number of phantoms and ordinary particles , such as gravitons .",
    "it can be shown that the decay rates of these interactions are infinite which indicates that the phantom models are dramatically unstable .",
    "but if we think of these models as the low - energy effective theories , with the fundamental fields having positive kinetic energy , then we should use a momentum cutoff @xmath7 in calculating the decay rates . in this way",
    "it can be shown that for @xmath8 , the lifetimes can become larger than the age of the universe when one chooses suitable phantom - gravity interaction potentials , and this removes the quantum instability of these kinds of phantom models .",
    "see @xcite for a specific example .",
    "some present data seems to favor an evolving dark energy with @xmath9 less than @xmath10 at present epoch from @xmath11 in the near past @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is therefore instructive to construct physical models in which @xmath9 can cross @xmath0 line ( dubbed as phantom - divide - line ) .",
    "neither the cosmological constant nor the dynamical scalar fields , like quintessence or phantom , can explain the @xmath0 crossing , hence some other theories have been introduced to describe this transition @xcite .",
    "one of these theories is the quintom model , which based on hybrid models @xcite@xcite , describes the transition from @xmath3 to @xmath5 regime by assuming that the cosmological fluid , besides the ordinary matter and radiation , is consisted of a quintessence and a phantom scalar field @xcite .",
    "a brief introduction of quintom model can be found in section two .",
    "this model can lead to quintessence domination , i.e. @xmath12 , at early time and phantom domination , i.e. @xmath13 , at late time . in @xcite , a phase - space analysis of the evolution for a spatially flat friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe containing a barotropic",
    "fluid and phantom - scalar fields with exponential potentials has been presented .",
    "it has been shown that the phantom - dominated scaling solution is the stable late - time attractor . in @xcite",
    "the same calculation has been done by introducing an interaction term between phantom and quintessence fields .",
    "recently , the hessence model , as a new view of quintom dark energy , in which the dark energy is described by a single non - canonical complex scalar field , rather than two independent real scalar fields , has been introduced @xcite .",
    "the evolution of @xmath9 in this model has been studied in @xcite and @xcite , via phase - space analysis .",
    "although this model allows @xmath9 to cross @xmath10 , but it avoids the late time singularity or the `` big rip '' .",
    "in this paper we study the transition from quintessence to phantom phase in the quintom model . instead of considering late time behavior of the model",
    "we try to investigate the behavior of cosmological parameters and scalar fields in a neighborhood of transition time . in section one , by assuming that the hubble parameter is continuous and differentiable function at transition time , we seek the necessary conditions that must be satisfied in order that the phase transition occurs . in section two , instead of a phase - space analysis , we try to obtain solution of einstein and friedmann equations in the vicinity of transition time for exponential and power law potentials for slowly varying fields .",
    "we show that the dynamical equations are consistent with the conditions needed for quintessence to phantom phase transition .",

    "this behavior is in agreement with present data of equation of state parameter @xmath9 .",
