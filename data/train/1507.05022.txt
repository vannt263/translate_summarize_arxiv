    "the notion of tetraquarks has undergone a significant paradigm change in recent years .",
    "there is now increasing evidence for four - quark states in the heavy charm and bottom spectrum , with @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the charged @xmath6 states as the prime candidates  @xcite .",
    "their internal decomposition is under debate : are they ` compact ' tetraquarks with equally distributed constituents ? or do they rather prefer to be in a diquark - antidiquark or a meson - molecule configuration ?",
    "the oldest tetraquark candidates are those in the light scalar meson nonet : the @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which do not fit into the conventional meson spectrum .",
    "why are the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mass - degenerate , with masses close to @xmath11 threshold ?",
    "why are their decay widths so different from @xmath12 and @xmath2 ? and why are these states so light ? in the quark - model counting , scalar mesons should be @xmath13 waves with one unit of orbital angular momentum .",
    "hence , they should have masses of about @xmath14 gev , similar to their axial - vector and tensor counterparts .",
    "a possible explanation has been proposed long ago  @xcite : what if these ` mesons ' were actually tetraquarks in the form of diquark - antidiquark states ? two scalar diquarks form again a nonet , but the mass ordering is reversed : the @xmath12 would be the lightest state made of up and down quarks only , whereas @xmath10 and @xmath9 would be heaviest and mass - degenerate because they carry two strange quarks .",
    "this would also explain the decay widths : @xmath10 and @xmath9 are close to @xmath11 threshold and therefore narrow , but @xmath12 and @xmath2 can simply fall apart into two pions or a pion and kaon , respectively , without exchanging gluons . in that case",
    "the actual @xmath15 ground states would be indeed the ` first radially excited nonet ' with masses in the @xmath16 gev region .",
    "the non-@xmath15 interpretation of the light scalar nonet is supported by a variety of approaches such as unitarized chpt , quark models , or the extended linear @xmath12 model  @xcite .",
    "the status of tetraquarks at large @xmath17 is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also jos pelaez contribution to these proceedings .",
    "irrespective of their internal decomposition , what we can say with certainty is the following : if four - quark states exist , they should appear in qcd s spectral representation and produce poles in the eight - quark correlator , or more precisely , in the connected @xmath18 scattering matrix @xmath19 .",
    "looking for bound - state poles in higher @xmath20point functions is the essence of the bethe - salpeter approach : at the pole position , the @xmath21matrix becomes the product of two bethe - salpeter amplitudes , and from the onshell propagator pole we can read off the mass of the state .",
    "the @xmath21matrix can be determined from the scattering equation or inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "it has the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the product of four dressed quark propagators and @xmath24 is the four - quark interaction kernel .",
    "the scattering equation at the pole reduces to the homogeneous bse shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4b - bse ] , which has a solution only if the @xmath21matrix has a pole .",
    "the kernel is the sum of two- , three- and four - body irreducible interactions ( we already omitted the three- and four - body pieces in fig .",
    "[ fig:4b - bse ] ) , and the specific form of the pair interactions is necessary to prevent overcounting  @xcite .",
    "the equation in the figure is written in the ` diquark - antidiquark ' topology ( 12)(34 ) ; there are two further permutations ( 23)(14 ) , ( 31)(24 ) with meson - meson topologies .",
    "the two - body kernel that appears here must be consistent with the underlying quark - gluon structure to preserve qcd s chiral symmetry . a feasible way to achieve",
    "this is to employ a rainbow - ladder kernel , where the two - quark interaction is simplified to an iterated gluon exchange , and solve the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) for the quark propagator with this input .",
    "as reviewed elsewhere  @xcite , the phenomenology of pseudoscalar and vector mesons , as well as baryon octet and decuplet ground states , can be reasonably well described in such a setup .",
    "this implies not only mass spectra but also their form factors and other properties , and it extends to charmonium and bottomonium spectra .",
    "calculations beyond rainbow - ladder are underway and aim , for example , to include the ` pion - cloud ' corrections to form factors  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are many observables where gluon exchange alone does _ not _ provide the answer , for instance : scalar and axialvector mesons ( the ` @xmath13 waves ' in the quark model ) , heavy - light mesons , or excited hadrons .",
    "when viewed as a @xmath15 state , rainbow - ladder produces a @xmath25meson mass of @xmath26 mev .",
    "its status beyond rainbow - ladder is presently unclear : in some recent calculations the mass goes down even further  @xcite , which would again provide support for a @xmath15 interpretation . on the other hand",
    ", these studies do not only produce a light isoscalar but also a mass - degenerate light isotriplet , which leads back to the ` wrong ' mass ordering : @xmath27 .",
    "hence , there are most likely further effects at play .",
    "as a first step towards solving the four - body problem , let us take a simpler route that is motivated by the quark - diquark model for baryons  @xcite .",
    "when three - body interactions are neglected , the three - body bse analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig:4b - bse ] can be simplified to a quark - diquark bse where gluons no longer appear .",
    "instead , quarks interact with scalar and axialvector diquarks via quark exchange .",
    "it turns out that the quark - diquark approach , when employing rainbow - ladder dse and bse solutions for its ingredients , provides a rather good approximation for the three - body equation regarding nucleon and @xmath28 properties  @xcite .",
    "based on this observation , one can proceed in an analogous way with the four - body equation . fig .",
    "[ fig:4b - bse ] can be rewritten as a faddeev - yakubovsky equation  @xcite , and after assuming separability for the @xmath29 and @xmath15 scattering matrices it reduces to a coupled diquark - antidiquark / meson - meson equation where the interaction takes place via quark exchange  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the equations can be combined into a single meson - meson equation ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b - bse ] ) but not vice versa .",
    "this already hints at the meson - molecule nature of the system , where diquarks only appear as internal admixtures . using rainbow - ladder dse and bse solutions for the ingredients , the solution for the @xmath12 mass",
    "was found to be @xmath30 mev  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the isoscalar - scalar mass as a function of the input current - quark mass is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the omission of the diquark diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b - bse ] changes almost nothing , so the diquark admixture is practically irrelevant .",
    "the light @xmath12 mass is therefore tied to the behavior of the light pions which are qcd s goldstone bosons in the chiral limit : the tetraquark mass lies just below the pseudoscalar - meson threshold , except for very low quark masses where it becomes a resonance .",
    "moreover , the calculation also predicts a relatively light @xmath31 state as well as an all - charm tetraquark below @xmath32 .",
    "how reliable are these results given the approximations that were employed ? to find out ,",
    "let us go back to the original four - body equation .",
    "a scalar @xmath15 state is predominantly in @xmath13 wave , but a scalar four - quark state forms an @xmath33wave orbital ground state .",
    "employing a rainbow - ladder kernel is therefore well motivated from the aforementioned meson and baryon studies , and its reliability can be judged from their results .",
    "the main difficulty in solving the system in fig .  [ fig:4b - bse ] is the complicated structure of the tetraquark amplitude .",
    "it is a five - point function and depends on four independent momenta .",
    "the amplitude can be decomposed into two color structures and 256 dirac - lorentz tensors , and the resulting 512 lorentz - invariant dressing functions depend on nine independent variables .",
    "it is practically impossible to solve this equation on present computers , so we must resort to approximations .",
    "since they should respect the symmetries of the system , we proceed as follows :        \\(i ) we keep the 16 ( @xmath34-wave ) dirac - lorentz tensors that do not depend on any relative momentum . this is a closed set under fierz transformations , so it contains ` diquark - antidiquark'-like structures such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the ( 12)(34 ) topology , but via fierz identities it also generates meson - meson - like structures @xmath37 in the crossed channels .",
    "\\(ii ) we take into account both color structures , which can be written in either of the fierz - equivalent topologies : diquark - antidiquark ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) or meson - meson ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) we arrange the nine momentum variables into irreducible multiplets of the permutation group @xmath42  @xcite , which allows us to switch on groups of variables separately in the solution process and thereby judge their importance .",
    "the nine variables can be grouped into a symmetric singlet @xmath43 , a doublet @xmath44 , and two triplets @xmath45 , @xmath46 : @xmath47 , \\quad \\dots\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the mandelstam variables for the three topologies .",
    "hence , the dressing functions can be written as @xmath51 .",
    "the doublet phase space that remains invariant under the equation forms the interior of a triangle bound by the lines @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( see left panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : ev ] ) , whereas the triplets form a tetrahedron and a sphere .",
    "the resulting eigenvalue of the four - body bse is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ev ] .",
    "since the equation has the form @xmath55 , one can extract the mass of the state by tracking the largest eigenvalue of the kernel as a function of the total momentum squared : @xmath56 .",
    "if we allow the system to generate a momentum dependence in @xmath57 only , the eigenvalue ( second curve from below ) would cross the line @xmath58 at @xmath59 mev .",
    "this is essentially ` four times the constituent - quark mass ' and would describe a rather simple tetraquark .",
    "switching on the triplets does not change the result appreciably , but adding the doublet @xmath60 has a drastic effect : the eigenvalue curve is now almost flat and crosses at @xmath61 mev .",
    "what happened ?",
    "the exterior of the triangle exhibits pion and diquark poles at timelike values of the mandelstam variables , illustrated by the dashed and double lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ev ] .",
    "we emphasize that the four - body equation knows a priori _ nothing _ about pions and diquarks but rather generates them dynamically .",
    "they influence the behavior of the dressing functions in the interior , which is clearly visible in the contour plot : the pion mass is small and the pion poles are close to the triangle , whereas the scalar diquarks have no visible effect because their mass scale @xmath62 mev is much larger . if the pion poles are removed by hand via phase space cuts , the uppermost eigenvalue curve in the right panel approaches again its companions .    therefore , we can confirm our findings from the two - body equation : the system is dominated by pions rather than diquarks . while this would be difficult to judge from the tensor structures alone ( because they mix under fierz transformations ) , the momentum dependence of the amplitudes clearly provides such information .",
    "the equation also produces a physical threshold : if @xmath63 , the poles enter the integration domain and the tetraquark becomes a resonance . in that case",
    "we must resort to extrapolations to estimate the real part of the mass .",
    "the current - mass dependence of the scalar - isoscalar tetraquark mass is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] and mirrors the result from the two - body equation . at the physical @xmath64 mass , our results for @xmath12 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath65",
    "we have solved the four - quark bethe - salpeter equation for a scalar tetraquark .",
    "the outcome provides a simple dynamical explanation for the light @xmath12 mass : the system is dominated by pion poles , which are dynamically generated in the solution process and drive the tetraquark mass from ` four times the constituent - quark mass ' to @xmath66 mev .",
    "the masses for the multiplet partners @xmath2 and @xmath3 follow an analogous pattern .",
    "this provides support for the interpretation of the light scalar nonet as tetraquarks .",
    "however , they are not diquark - antidiquark states but predominantly ` meson molecules ' , which explains their mass ordering as an indirect consequence of qcd s spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
