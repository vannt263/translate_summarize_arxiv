    "collective vibrations of nuclei are interesting phenomena in quantum many - body dynamics .",
    "the constituent nucleons coherently participate in these vibrations and the motion can be intuitively understood in classical terms as a global vibration of an excited liquid drop . in a quantum mechanical sense , the dynamics is described by a coherent superposition of many particle - hole excitations on top of the ground - state configuration .",
    "these collective vibrations have been experimentally observed for thirty years as broad resonances ( giant resonances ) in the high - energy spectrum of nuclei @xcite .",
    "the existence of such resonances has been reported for many different medium - heavy and heavy nuclei in the isotopic table , and their characteristics have been successfully reproduced in mean - field - based approaches @xcite .",
    "these theoretical studies have shown that collective modes are privileged probes of the effective interaction , and as such they can bear important information on nuclear matter properties . in particular , the isoscalar giant monopole resonance or the breathing mode of nuclei is connected to the incompressibility of nuclear matter , even if this connection is far from being direct @xcite .",
    "experimental data on the isoscalar monopole response of nuclei as light as @xmath1 or @xmath2 @xcite show a fragmented strength distribution , which is qualitatively understood as a global weakening of the collectivity but is not quantitatively understood .",
    "it is well known that correlations play an important role in the structure of these light nuclei and the application of standard hartree - fock ( hf ) or random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations to their collective dynamics may be questionable .",
    "this is particularly true in nuclei presenting clustered structures , a phenomenon that is expected both in excited states and in the ground state of numerous light and medium - heavy @xmath6 nuclei @xcite .",
    "in such situations , one can expect that collective vibrations may imply collective motions of the underlying clusters .",
    "indeed , it has already been reported in the literature that collective strengths to low - lying states are affected by the cluster degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) corresponds to relatively small amplitude of a collective monopole excitation .",
    "another interesting regime of nuclear dynamics is given by large - amplitude collective motion with a significant compression of the system followed by expansion . at excitations of the order of 3 @xmath7mev or higher",
    ", it leads to the observable phenomenon of nuclear fragmentation @xcite .",
    "here the situation is qualitatively similar to the excitation of giant resonances : when a heavy nucleus is compressed significantly , the dynamics of compression and expansion appears to be governed by global collective properties , namely , the nuclear matter equation of state , and appears to be largely independent of the structure properties of the excited nucleus @xcite .",
    "conversely , if the ground state and/or excited states have pronounced clustered structure , one may expect an interplay between these structures and the collective dynamics and fragmentation pattern .",
    "a systematic study of the fragmentation of light clustered nuclei has never been done , but some indications exist as a preferential @xmath4-particle emission from @xmath4-structured nuclei @xcite .    in this respect , models able to describe both the small- and large - amplitude collective regime are useful tools for understanding collective nuclear dynamics .",
    "interesting studies have been performed in the context of time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) calculations @xcite and its semiclassical counterpart @xcite and a cluster - based time - dependent approach @xcite .",
    "antisymmetrized versions of molecular dynamics models , antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite and fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) @xcite , are powerful approaches for describing both nuclear structure and reactions .",
    "they are microscopic models based on nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the wave function is modeled as a fully antisymmetrized product of gaussian wave packets .",
    "the choice of the nonorthogonal gaussian wave packets is a restriction of general slater determinants , but it has an advantage of allowing spontaneous breaking of all spatial symmetries . because of that , these models are particularly suitable to describe cluster and molecular states .",
    "after projection over appropriate quantum numbers , they have been successfully applied to describe the structure change from shell - model - like structure to clustering structure @xcite .",
    "they also have been applied to nuclear reactions from fusion @xcite to multifragmentation reactions @xcite . for small - amplitude collective modes ,",
    "the isovector dipole oscillation has been studied with amd @xcite but almost no application to the isoscalar monopole modes has been performed to our knowledge .    in this paper",
    ", we use the simplest version of the model employing a single slater determinant .",
    "this approximation is not sufficient to realistically describe nuclear spectroscopy , but it allows us to understand qualitatively the effect of clustering on the collective dynamics .",
    "the use of a fully time - dependent approach allows us in principle to study consistently the motion from the small - amplitude rpa regime to the large - amplitude fragmentation regime . in this first application , two - body collisions and quantum branching , which are necessary to explain experimental data of heavy - ion collisions around fermi energies @xcite , are not implemented , but their inclusion is straightforward .    the main difference between amd and fmd concerns the width degree of freedom . in fmd ,",
    "the centroids and width of gaussians are both complex time - dependent variational parameters whereas , in amd , the width is an external real number common to all the gaussians .",
    "the isoscalar monopole oscillation is supposed to correspond to a breathing mode , so that the width degree of freedom may have a significant importance . by comparing the results between amd and fmd",
    ", we would also like to clarify what degrees of freedom are important to properly describe compression modes .",
    "in the amd and fmd models , the optimal time dependence of the @xmath8-body wave function is obtained through the time - dependent variational principle @xmath9 within the constraint that @xmath10 is given by a slater determinant of the single - particle states @xmath11 , @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is number of nucleons .    if no extra restriction on the single - particle wave functions @xmath13 is applied , eq .",
    "( [ eq : timevariation ] ) gives the tdhf equation @xcite .",
    "however , in the amd and fmd models , the single - particle wave functions @xmath13 are restricted to the gaussian form : @xmath14\\chi_{\\alpha_i }   \\label{gaussian}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are complex time - dependent variational parameters . in the fmd formulation ,",
    "the wave packet width @xmath17 is an additional complex time - dependent variational parameter .",
    "in contrast , in the amd model , all wave packets share the same real constant width @xmath18 .",
    "the spin - isospin states @xmath19 give additional variational parameters , which are essential to describe charge - exchange reactions and spin excitations .",
    "in the present application to scalar - isoscalar collective modes , only spin and isospin saturated systems will be considered .",
    "we will then restrict ourselves to a simple variation in the configuration space and the spin - isospin states will be treated as constants of motion .",
    "the equations of motion for amd and fmd as resulting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : timevariation ] ) can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath22 taken with the wave function @xmath23 , @xmath24 appears because of the non - orthogonality of gaussian wave packets and is given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 give the variational parameters for nucleon @xmath27 in the model , namely , @xmath28 in fmd and @xmath29 in amd . for further details ,",
    "see refs .  @xcite .",
    "the ground state is obtained by minimizing the energy expectation value @xmath30 with respect to the variational parameters of the models .",
    "the molecular dynamics ansatz eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) represents a restriction of the full space for the single - particle wave function .",
    "this means that a full hf calculation in three - dimensional @xmath31-space is a generalization of this model , though molecular dynamics can be superior to hf if the latter is solved on a truncated basis or by imposing the conservation of chosen spatial symmetries @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "amd and fmd ground - state energies have to be seen as upper limits of the hf ground - state value .",
    "table [ tb : gsprop ] shows some ground - state properties , namely , the ground - state energy @xmath32 and the matter root - mean - square radius @xmath33 obtained by amd and fmd for several selected nuclei . results with sly4 @xcite , gogny @xcite , and the old siii effective interaction @xcite are shown .",
    "sly4 and siii are skyrme interactions , namely , of @xmath34-type , with symmetric nuclear matter incompressibilities of @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev , respectively .",
    "gogny is a finite - range interaction with an incompressibility modulus of @xmath37 mev .",
    "both gogny and sly4 are realistic interactions that have been successfully compared to different experimental data on nuclear masses and collective modes .",
    "siii also gives reasonable values for nuclear masses along the stability valley , but it is known to exhibit a too high incompressibility .",

    "@xcite and the experimental data from the atomic mass evaluation @xcite are also shown in the table for comparison .",
    ".ground - state properties [ energy @xmath38 ( mev ) and root - mean - square radius @xmath33 ( fm ) ] for @xmath39 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 calculated by amd and fmd with three different effective interactions ( sly4 , siii , and gogny )",

    "we can see that both the cluster moving and cluster breathing modes are excited when the initial state is prepared by a radial translation of the wave packets centroids [ eq .  ( [ eq : amd_init ] ) ] , whereas only the cluster breathing mode is observed if the standard monopole boost [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmd_init ] ) ] is applied to the ground state fmd wave function in the small - amplitude limit .",
    "this suggests that the cluster moving mode in @xmath1 may be due to a coupling between the initial excitation [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : amd_init ] ) ] applied on a deformed ground state and the monopole mode built on top of it , owing to the nonlinearity of the fmd dynamics at finite amplitude .",
    "a similar effect was already reported in tdhf calculations in ref .",
    "moreover , in the case of @xmath1 , the experimental threshold energy for 3-@xmath4 breakup is given by @xmath42 mev which is below the energy associated with the collective frequency of the cluster moving mode of amd and fmd , even considering the coulomb barrier , which is expected to be around 2 mev @xcite .",
    "the observed vibration appears then more as a virtual diffusion state than as a resonant state .",
    "this is however not the case for all cluster moving modes . as an example we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mg24 ft ] the fourier transform @xmath43(\\omega)$ ] of the fmd oscillation in small amplitude for @xmath3 .",
    "( \\omega)$ ] in arbitrary units of the fmd monopole oscillation in small amplitude for @xmath3 with the sly4 interaction . ]    the ground state of @xmath3 is found to be a deformed prolate shape and it is natural to find a fragmented structure in the spectrum function of such a nucleus since the monopole oscillation is strongly coupled to the quadrupole oscillation .",
    "however , the analysis of the variational parameters @xmath44 reveals that once again the peaks are related to different motions of the underlying quasi - clusters .",
    "specifically , the origin of the three major peaks ( @xmath45 , 22 , and 25 mev ) are seen to correspond with 3``@xmath46 '' , 2``@xmath46 '' + 2``@xmath4 '' , and 6``@xmath4 '' , respectively , where `` @xmath46 '' denotes the effective cluster for @xmath47 as `` @xmath4 '' for @xmath39 .",
    "these peak frequencies are below the experimental threshold energy for 6-@xmath4 breakup , @xmath48 mev and therefore these resonances may physically exist , although the implementation of the spin - orbit interaction and the projection over angular momentum and parity before the variational procedure will be necessary for a further quantitative discussion .    for comparison",
    ", the experimental monopole strength distribution @xcite of this nucleus shows a very broad structure peaked at around 21 mev with a root - mean - square width of around @xmath49-@xmath50 mev , exhausting around 80% of the ewsr . here again , only qualitative conclusions can be advanced .",
    "if the complicated structure of the spectral functions that are systematically observed in light nuclei @xcite are certainly an indication of a global loss of collectivity , our study suggests that a multiple - peak monopole spectrum can also be an indication of clustered states .",
    "a prolongation of this work requires the inclusion of collisions and branching in the molecular dynamics @xcite , which would allow a quantitative prediction of the strength function as a possible observable to evidence cluster structures .",
    "other collective modes can also be investigated with our approach by choosing an appropriate initial state and analyzing the associated observable .",
    "in fact , in the oscillation calculation of @xmath1 discussed here , when adopting the initial state ( [ eq : amd_init ] ) , we also find another peak around 33 mev by looking at the fourier transform of the width variable of a proton wave packet .",
    "this extra peak is associated with the isovector monopole mode , which is clearly seen in the fourier transform of the differential time evolution of the proton and neutron root - mean - square radius @xmath51 ( the thin line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmd_c12param ] ) . indeed",
    "the chosen initial state , where all the wave packets have the same width , contains some isovector excitation in the fmd model because protons and neutrons have slightly different widths in the ground state owing to the coulomb force .",
    "in this paper we have studied collective isoscalar monopole oscillations for some selected light nuclei in the framework of the amd and fmd time - dependent approaches .",
    "the study of gmr in @xmath0 reveals that for medium - sized nuclei molecular dynamics models are in good agreement with tdhf calculations .",
    "a well - defined collective breathing mode is observed at a frequency that depends on the incompressibility modulus of the underlying effective interaction .",
    "clear collective modes are observed also for nuclei as light as @xmath1 , but the collective modes in light nuclei appear dominated by quasimolecular cluster structures .",
    "we have investigated in great detail the motion of @xmath1 as an example .",
    "the @xmath1 isoscalar monopole dynamics leads to a spectral function containing two distinct frequencies associated , respectively , with an oscillation of the effective three `` @xmath4 '' constituents around the nucleus center of mass and with a coherent vibration of the underlying clusters .",
    "this latter frequency sensitively increases with increasing incompressibility of the associated equation of state , but does not follow the empirical @xmath52@xmath53 law of the well - known breathing mode in medium - heavy and heavy nuclei .",
    "only the first mode is accessible to amd calculations , whereas the inclusion of the width degree of freedom appears essential to describe the second one .",
    "more complicated spectral functions can be observed in our calculations depending on the cluster structure of the nucleus .",
    "the presented calculations do not contain two - body collisions nor quantum branching , meaning that they can not describe the decay of the observed collective motions , which are expected to considerably increase the fragmentation of the monopole strength .",
    "however , the dominant modes should be preserved by such improved calculations @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics calculation such as amd and fmd therefore will be a powerful tool to study the interplay among clustering structures , collective resonances , and multiple breakup of various nuclei in the nuclear chart including unstable nuclei .",
