    "bourgain @xcite adjusted this approach to the periodic case , where there are certain difficulties due mainly to a `` lack of dispersion '' . in @xcite number theoretic methods",
    "were used to show that - is locally well - posed in @xmath21 , @xmath7 for any @xmath20 .",
    "assuming local existence there are many issues to be addressed about the behavior of the solution as @xmath22 ,    * global well - posedness / blow - up behavior * asymptotic stability * behavior of higher order sobolev norms of smooth solutions .    in this note",

    "however it is a more subtle problem to extend the global theory to infinite energy initial data .",
    "bourgain @xcite established global well posedness for in @xmath27 for any @xmath28 , by combining a  normal form \" reduction method ( see also @xcite ) , the  @xmath4-method \" , and a refined trilinear strichartz type inequality . the normal form reduction is achieved by symplectic transformations that , in some sense , reduce the nonlinear part of the equation to its `` essential part '' .",
    "the @xmath4-method , introduced by j. colliander , m. keel , g. staffilani , h. takaoka and t. tao in @xcite , is based on the almost conservation of certain modified hamiltonians .",
    "these two methods together yield global well - posedness in @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",

    "our approach is based on an implementation of the @xmath4-method itself adjusted to the periodic setting via elementary number theoretic techniques .    in order to present our method , we briefly review global well - posedness results on @xmath33 . using an approximation of the modified energy in the @xmath4-method ,",
    "tzirakis @xcite showed that the cauchy problem - is globally well posed in @xmath34 for any @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath35 the best known global well posedness result for - is in @xcite where the authors proved global well posedness for any @xmath36 . in both results ,",

    "the estimate fails if the two frequencies are comparable but continues to hold if the frequencies are separated ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "such an estimate is very useful when @xmath38 is in high frequency and @xmath39 is in low frequency since we can move derivatives freely to the low frequency factor .",
    "the main difficulty in obtaining global well - posedness results in the periodic context is exactly the absence of a quantitative refinement of the bilinear strichartz s estimate .",
    "the reader can consult the paper of kenig , ponce and vega , @xcite , where the difference between the real and the periodic case is clearly exposed when one tries to prove bilinear estimates in different functional spaces .    in order to overcome the non - availability of a quantitative refined strichartz s estimate , we develop a different strategy , closer in spirit to the approach in @xcite . by exploiting the scaling symmetry of the equation",

    "such an estimate allows us to use the @xmath4-method machinery in an efficient way .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath51 , beside rescaling , we follow the argument in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where one applies the @xmath4-operator to the equation on @xmath52 , and defines a modified second energy functional as the energy corresponding to the new `` @xmath4-system '' . we prove that such modified second energy is `` almost conserved '' , that is the time derivative of this new energy decays with respect to a very large parameter @xmath53 . roughly speaking",

    "we prove a local existence result for the `` @xmath4-system '' , under a smallness assumption for the initial data , which is guaranteed by choosing @xmath48 in terms of @xmath53 .",
    "the decay of the modified energy enables us to iterate the local existence preserving the same bound for @xmath54 during the iteration process . by undoing the scaling we obtain polynomial in time bounds for @xmath55 in @xmath56 , and",

    "] of the estimate of the first energy , a better strichartz inequality was needed to successfully conclude the argument .",
    "we then proceeded by determining a qualitative  @xmath58-refined \" strichartz type estimate , see proposition [ 2dcounting ] , which allowed us to implement the @xmath4-method described above to obtain indeed the following result :    [ main2d ] the initial value problem - is globally well - posed in @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "we remark that , as we mentioned above , in 1d we introduce an approximation to the modified energy , by adding correction terms , in the spirit of @xcite and @xcite . in the 2d problem",
    "we did not use correction terms , since the fourier multipliers corresponding to the approximated modified energy would be singular .",
    "this singularity is not only caused by the presence of zero frequencies , but also by orthogonality issues .",
    "this is a whole new ground that we are exploring in a different paper .      in section 2",
    "we review the notation and some known strichartz estimates for the periodic schrodinger equations in 1d and 2d . in section 3 we present the proof of theorem [ main1d ] , while in section 4 we give a proof of theorem [ main2d ] .",
