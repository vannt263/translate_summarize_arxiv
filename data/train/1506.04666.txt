    "the n - body problem concerns the study of the dynamics of @xmath1 point masses subject to their mutual newtonian gravitational interaction . if @xmath2 , it is impossible to obtain a general solution to this problem because of its non - integrability ; hence , particular solutions are very important in this case .",
    "central configurations are the configurations for which the total newtonian acceleration of every body is equal to a constant multiplied by the position vector of this body with respect to the center of mass of the configuration .",
    "one of the reasons why central configurations are interesting is because they allow us to obtain explicit homographic solutions of the n - body problem i. e. motion where the configuration of the system changes its size but keeps its shape .",
    "moreover , they arise as the limiting configuration of a total collapse .",
    "the papers dealing with central configurations have focused on several aspects such as finding examples of particular central configurations , giving the number of central configurations and studying their symmetry , stability , stacking properties , etc .",
    "a stacked central configuration is a central configuration that contains others central configurations by dropping some bodies .",
    "some important references on this theme are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this work deals with central configurations of the spatial seven - body problem where six masses are at the vertices of two equilateral triangles .",
    "those triangles belong to parallel planes and one of then is the rotation by the angle @xmath0 rad with respect to the other one . the seventh body is located between these planes on the line perpendicular passing through the center of the triangles and equidistant to them .",
    "@xcite studied the case where the triangles are not rotated and they proof the existence of one and only one class of central configuration of that problem .",
    "our results are similar to them as they had predicted .",
    "the masses at the triangles must be equal and the only central configuration is that in which those masses are at vertices of a regular octahedron and it does not depends on the value of the seventh mass .",
    "consider @xmath1 masses , @xmath3 , in @xmath4 subject to their mutual newtonian gravitational interaction .",
    "let @xmath5 be the matrix of masses and let @xmath6 be the position vector .",
    "the equations of motion in an inertial reference frame with origin at the center of mass are given by @xmath7 where @xmath8    a non - collision configuration @xmath9 with @xmath10 is a _ central configuration _ if there exists a constant @xmath11 such that @xmath12    the value of @xmath11 is uniquely determined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the moment of inertia of the system .",
    "so @xmath11 is a positive constant .",
    "there are some equivalents ways to describe central configurations .",
    "nonplanar central configurations can be given by laura - androyer - dziobeck equations ( see @xcite )    @xmath15    for @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 is six time the signed volume of the tetrahedron formed by the bodies at positions @xmath19 and @xmath20 this is a system with @xmath21 equations very useful in problem with many symmetries .",
    "we are interested in a particular spatial seven bodies problem where six masses are at the vertices of two equilateral triangles belong to parallel planes and one of then is a rotation by the angle @xmath0 with respect to the other one .",
    "the seventh body is located between these planes on the line perpendicular passing through the center of the triangles and equidistant to them .",
    "see figure [ 7bodies ] .",
    "our main result is the theorem following which characterizes such configurations .",
    "[ lemaequalmasses ] consider seven bodies with position vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 and masses @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "suppose that @xmath26 are at the vertices of a equilateral triangle and @xmath27 are at vertices of another equilateral triangle located in a plane parallel to the first one .",
    "the second triangle coincides with the first one under a rotation by the angle @xmath0 and a projection to its plane .",
    "@xmath23 is located between these planes on the line perpendicular passing through the center of the triangles and equidistant to them .",
    "see figure [ 7bodies ] and figure [ topview ] .",
    "then we have a central configuration if and only if @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are at the vertices of a regular octahedron with @xmath23 at its center .",
    "see figure [ octahedron ] .    using equations [ dziobeck ] , we have @xmath31 for @xmath32    the symmetry given by our assumption implies in 27 already identically zero equations : @xmath33 @xmath34    consider the equation @xmath35 @xmath36 by our hypothesis we get @xmath37 and @xmath38 moreover @xmath39 so @xmath40 is equivalent to @xmath41 which implies @xmath42 since @xmath43 and @xmath44    analogously the equations @xmath45 and @xmath46 imply @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "now taking into account @xmath49 and @xmath50 the equation @xmath51 implies @xmath52 and so @xmath53 since @xmath54 this in turn implies the equalities @xmath55 therefore the six bodies @xmath56 form a regular octahedron .",
    "now we look to equation @xmath57 since @xmath58 and @xmath59 we get @xmath60 and so @xmath61 therefore all masses at the triangles have the same value , say @xmath62    assuming equal masses at the triangles the following 12 equations are already satisfied : @xmath63 @xmath64 assuming @xmath28 we also get : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 if we suppose ( [ eqdistances ] ) these 36 equations are already identically zero .    finally , we will take a look in those 45 equations @xmath69 where @xmath70 or @xmath71 with @xmath72 first remember that we have already satisfied the following equations : @xmath73 @xmath74    moreover , for the remaining ones we have @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78    since @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the equation @xmath81 becomes @xmath82 which is satisfied if and only if ( [ eqdistances ] ) occurs .",
    "therefore a central configuration of the seven - body problem with shape given by our hypothesis there exists if and only if @xmath28 and @xmath83 holds true .",
    "our result is in accordance with the provisions by @xcite . in fact , we obtain basically the same results but the calculation here were a little easier .",
    "if we take a system of coordinates in which @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 the equation ( [ eqdistances ] ) becomes @xmath87    again , as well as the results and provisions by @xcite , there is not restriction on the choice of @xmath88 equation ( [ eqdistances ] ) says that the masses @xmath89 and @xmath90 are at the vertices of a regular octahedron , a well known central configuration .",
    "so the configuration studied in this paper results in a stacked central configuration with seven bodies .",
    "see figure [ octahedron ] ."
