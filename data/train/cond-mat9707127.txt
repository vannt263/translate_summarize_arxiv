    "a general accurate description of the electronic structure of materials with correlated electrons has yet to be developed .",
    "such materials include the high - t@xmath5 and colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) materials , as well as the mixed - valence and heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "all these systems demonstrate essentially many - particle ( correlation ) features in their excitation spectrum and ground - state properties , the usual language of one - electron band theory being inadequate to describe such features even qualitatively : e.g. , the problem of mott insulators , the heavy - fermion behavior in some rare - earth compounds , satellites and `` mid - gap states '' in electron spectra etc .",
    "( see e.g. recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "such effects as the metal - insulator transition , kondo effect , and others , which helps to understand the basic physics in these strongly correlated materials , is usually considered in the framework of simplified models such as the hubbard model , anderson model , s - f exchange model and other correlation models .",
    "nevertheless the complexity of the crystals containing 10 - 15 different atoms per unit cell , interactions between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom demands a more detailed investigation of the energy bands in such systems .",
    "the only general first - principles approach that takes into account in practice specific peculiarities of the electronic structure in real compounds are those based on the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of practical dft applications today are based on the local density approximation ( lda ) , which treats the exchange - correlation ( xc ) part of an effective single - particle dft potential as a density dependent xc - potential , taken from the exact quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) results for the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "there are many successes but also some failures of lda approach@xcite , related to the simple fact that in cases where some portion of electronic structure is better described in terms of atomic - like electronic states , the homogeneous electron gas approximation is not a good starting point .",
    "another limitation of lda theory is that it is only a ground state scheme and the one - particle band - structure itself has , generally speaking , no proper meaning .",
    "recently the time - dependent ( td - lda ) approach has been applied for calculations of excitation energies@xcite , but the td - lda effective potential is not known as good as lda one . on the other hand ,",
    "exact qmc calculations for real materials which have tedious first - principle hartree - fock band structure as zero order approximations is still a challenging problem of solid state theory@xcite .",
    "in this situation it is useful to have simple and accurate scheme that could still capture the most important properties of real electronic structure and at the same time could take into account the most important correlation effects .",
    "one of the first successful approach in this line was the gw - approximation @xcite for quasiparticle spectra in solids with the self - energy related to a `` bare '' green function ( g ) and a screened coulomb interaction ( w ) .",
    "self - consistent gw calculations basing on the lda band structure gives much better description of a mott insulator such as nio than does pure lda @xcite .",
    "still , the non - local coulomb interactions make such type of calculations really time consuming . for the purpose of only band - structure investigations one could use a simplified time - independent gw - scheme or so - called screen - exchange ( sx - lda ) approach@xcite .",
    "the later approach has of the same drawbacks as does hartree - fock approximation and did not suitable for strongly correlated systems . a different way to incorporate some correlation effect in the systems with localized d- or f",
    "- states was successfully done in so - called lda+u method@xcite . in this case a simple mean - field hubbard - like term is added to lda functionals for the localized state and care must be taken for correction of the lda double - counting @xcite .",
    "this approach can also be viewed as a density functional theory , since the u terms that depend on occupation number for localized electrons is a functional of the total density .",
    "so one just uses the lda - functional for delocalized electrons and improved lda+u functional for localized atomic - like states .",
    "this approach produces a more reliable description of the electronic and crystal structure of correlated materials with charge , spin , and orbital ordering than does the lsda scheme@xcite .",
    "but lda+u scheme , as well as the approach based on the so called self - interaction corrections ( sic ) @xcite , has one intrinsic shortcoming related with a mean - field approximation .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the most interesting correlation effects in quasiparticle spectra such as the mass enhancement , damping , the difference of the distribution function from the `` fermi step '' are connected with the energy dependence of the self - energy @xmath6 , so one needs to generalize lda+u approach to include dynamical effects .",
    "such scheme we would like to call `` lda++''@xcite .",
    "one can mentions few successful attempts in this directions : quasiparticle ( qp ) band structure calculation of fe , co and ni@xcite as well as heavy fermion system@xcite using simplest second order local approximation for the self - energy ; qp - band structure of nio@xcite using 3-body faddeev approximation ; rpa - like approach for htsc@xcite and non - crossing approximations ( nca ) for kondo systems@xcite . at the same time , a criterion for the applicability of specific approximations used in these works was not clear .",
    "in this paper we propose a general scheme for lda++ band structure calculations for real materials with the different strength of electronic correlations .",
    "it is not very efficiently from the computational point of view ( as well as not very reasonable from the purely theoretical one ) to use the only lda++ scheme for materials with a different electron - electron interactions . in accordance with the ratio of average on - site coulomb parameter u to the relevant valence band width w",
    ", it is useful to distinguish three regimes of weak , moderate and strong correlations .    the simplest case of weak correlations ( u / w@xmath41 - `` transition metals '' ) we could use the self - consistent diagrammatic approach .",
    "the most convenient way is the conserving fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite and we will use the multiband generalizations for lda++ weak correlation scheme .",
    "the characteristic feature of this renormalized band regime that no additional states appears in the electronic structure due to interactions or , more exactly , there is one - to - one correspondence of quasiparticle states with and without interaction .",
    "roughly speaking , the shape of energy bands may be changed but there are no band splitting , or presence of additional bands .",
    "the most interesting physical phenomena in this case are the renormalization of the effective masses , flattening of van hove singularities etc .    in the case of very strong interactions ( u / w@xmath01 - `` rare - earth system '' ) we will start with exact atomic greens function for f - states and use the hubbard - i approximation ( hia ) @xcite to analyze the spectrum of f - systems .",
    "this approach also may be applied to such d - systems as mott insulators with very narrow d - bands .",
    "for this situation the electronic structure of solids will combine the many - body structure of f(d)-ions and broad bands from delocalized electrons . in this case such phenomena as multiplet structure , satellites in photoelectron spectra , the narrowing of the electron bands depending on the magnetic ordering etc are the subjects of main interests .",
    "in the most difficult case of strongly correlated physics ( u / w @xmath21 - `` metal - insulator transition '' regime or `` kondo systems '' ) we will use the interpolation scheme based on dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite . in this situation we will have a `` three - peak structure '' from a single correlated band , consisting of upper and lower hubbard bands and kondo resonance near the fermi energy .",
    "such scheme is the most accurate , but also the most time consuming , and it is difficult to make a self - consistent calculations for a large system .",
    "the other point of view of the different lda++ schemes could be related to the different energy scales for the spectrum of correlated materials : if one is interested in the large energy scale that hia - approximation is sufficient for spectroscopic purposes .",
    "if we like to describe low - energy scale of a system like doped mott insulators or mixed valence systems then dmft approach is the most adequate .",
    "the common feature of all lda++ methods is the matrix form of self - energy since electron - electron correlations can not be diagonalized neither in band index @xmath7 nor in orbital indices @xmath8 .",
    "this peculiarity of multi - band hubbard interactions are normally ignored and only few examples of matrix self - energy exist for transition metal with lda second - order perturbation scheme @xcite , transition - metal oxides within 3-body faddeev approximation@xcite and for two - band hubbard model for investigation of orbital and magnetic instabilities @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    ". we will give a general description of different correlations scheme to the dynamical mean field band structure calculations .",
    "the simple two - bands model ( sec.iii ) will illustrate in practice all lda++ methods . in the sec.iv",
    "we will give an example of first - principle calculations of mixed - valence system tmse and classical mott insulator nio within hubbard-1 approximation to lda++ .",
    "finally we summarize our results in the sec v.",
    "the `` kohn - sham '' energies of one - particle lda states can not be considered as the quasiparticle energies in the sense of many - particle theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the lda++ approach they considered only as the `` bare '' energies and",
    "are supposed to be renormalized by the correlation effects . of course they contain already some part of the correlation effects but only those which may be considered in the local density approximation .",
    "the most important `` rest '' in strongly correlated system is the correlations of the hubbard type @xcite due to the intra - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "therefore our starting point is the same as in the lda+u approach .",
    "we proceed with the hamiltonian    @xmath9    where the ( @xmath10 ) represents different crystal sites , \\{@xmath11 } label different orbitals and the \\{@xmath12 } are spin indices .",
    "coulomb matrix elements are defined in the usual way :    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the screened coulomb interactions and @xmath15 are localized on - site basis functions ( the site index being suppressed ) .    in this case",
    "all the orbitals are assumed to belong to the `` correlated '' set , while in real materials like high - t@xmath5 compounds ( e.g. , yba@xmath16cu@xmath17o@xmath18 ) we may define as a first approximation only the 3d orbitals as correlated ones .",
    "therefore it is more reasonable to rewrite eq.[h - mb ] in the form of lda+u hamiltonian :    @xmath19    note that index @xmath20 in the second sum of eq.[ldau ] running only for `` correlated '' sites , and orbital indices @xmath21 only for  correlated  states ( e.g. 3d or 4f ) while the first lda - term :    @xmath22 contains all sites and orbitals in the unit cell . here",
    "@xmath23 are the `` one - particle '' hamiltonian parameters in the ( spin - polarized ) lda , @xmath24 is the double counting correction for average coulomb interactions in l(s)da @xcite :    @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being average coulomb and exchange interactions and @xmath28 is the total number of correlated d(f)-electrons .",
    "one non - trivial problem is to find an efficient way to compute the one electron hamiltonian @xmath29 in a minimal orthogonal basis set .",
    "orthogonality of the basis functions is required for the use of second quantization form of the effective hamiltonian ( eq.[h - mb ] ) . since many - body ( @xmath30 ) part of the problem",
    "is an order of magnitude more time consuming than lda one , we need to use a minimal basis set and integrated out all high - energy degrees of freedom ( out of the @xmath31 range ) .",
    "one of the best lda - methods for such scheme is the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method @xcite , which could give the orthogonal down - folded one - electron tight - binding hamiltonian . in this case",
    "lda calculations corrected for double counting , produce the first - principle hopping @xmath32 in many body hamiltonian .",
    "now we can describe methods to efficient calculations of quasi - particle ( qp ) spectra for the lda+u hamiltonian . in this sense",
    "our approach is not any more density functional theory and one could benefit from the possibility to use the information on qp - band structure comparing with different `` excitation '' experiments .      in this section",
    "we generalize the flex equations@xcite for the purpose of multiband lda++ scheme .",
    "we will not take into account a momentum @xmath33-dependence of the self - energy , although in the flex approximation it is straightforward to include it in all the following formulas .",
    "the numerical computation of the @xmath34-dependent self - energy is time - consuming in multiband case @xcite . to unify the approximations for all our lda++ schemes",
    "we will not include explicitly the @xmath33-dependence in the flex formalism .",
    "first of all one needs to symmetrize the bare vertex matrix u over different fluctuation channels : particle - hole ( density - u@xmath35 and magnetic - u@xmath36 ) and particle - particle ( singlet - u@xmath37 and triplet - u@xmath38 ) vertex matrix :    @xmath39    the one - electron green - function is defined through the following equation :    @xmath40 here @xmath41 is chemical potential , @xmath42 are matsubara frequencies and @xmath43 is inverse temperature .",
    "the frequency independent hartree - fock part is    @xmath44    and corresponds to the rotationally invariant lda+u method @xcite .",
    "it is useful to write the multi - band flex equations using matrix - vector notation for different coulomb matrix vertices and vector green function .",
    "we will use a combine index : @xmath45 and defined the vector green function as well as matrix interactions in the following way :    @xmath46 for simplicity we first write equations for non - polarized spin states and omit the spin indices . in this case",
    "the hartree - fock approximation eq.[sig - hf ] can be rewritten in the form of a matrix - vector product only with `` density '' coulomb interaction :    @xmath47 where the occupation matrix is defined as :    @xmath48    using the single - site hubbard interactions one obtains a `` local form '' of flex equations in the frequency ( @xmath49 ) - time ( @xmath50 ) space .",
    "it is very efficient to use fast - fourier transforms with periodic boundary condition@xcite .",
    "time - frequency spaces are connected by    @xmath51    we will try to keep this dual ( @xmath52 notation to stress the numerical implementation of this lda++ scheme .",
    "we write the approximation for self - energy in the `` @xmath53''-like form :    @xmath54    where symmetrized fluctuation @xmath55-potential defined as :    @xmath56 and total fluctuation potential consists of the second - order term , as well as particle - hole and particle - particle contributions :    @xmath57    all these contributions can be expressed in terms of bare @xmath58 and renormalized @xmath59 channel propagators .",

    "since we will not use here these complicated expressions , they will be discussed in details elsewhere@xcite .",
    "historically hubbard - i approximation @xcite was the first and the simplest approximations for a strongly correlated one - band model .",
    "it has , however , many inconsistencies ( see e.g. discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "for example it is not conserving ( the self energy can not be represented as a functional derivative of the generating functional with respect to the green function ) and therefore does not obey the luttinger theorem and other `` exact '' fermi - liquid properties . for the half - filled nondegenerate hubbard model it always gives a gap in the energy spectrum , even for small u.",
    "this means that hia is completely inapplicable for small and medium interactions .",
    "but at the same time it gives a correct picture of the electron spectrum in the narrow - band limit . therefore it seems to be very useful in 4f systems with a very strong degree of localization of the electron states . applying to some real systems in the framework of lda++ approach",
    ", hia - scheme could give ( as it will be shown below ) an effective and non - trivial descriptions of many - body multiplet effects .",
    "to introduce hubbard - i type approximation in degenerate case it is convenient to exploit the so called atomic representation and hubbard @xmath73-operators ( see @xcite )    @xmath74 where @xmath75 are multielectron states of the site @xmath20 as a whole ( configuration and multiplet indices ) . in terms of @xmath73-operators",
    "the atomic hamiltonian has very simple form    @xmath76    on the other hand , the inter - site transfer hamiltonian , which has very simple ( bilinear ) structure in terms of the operators @xmath77 , @xmath78 , also can be expressed in terms of @xmath73-operators by the relations @xmath79 and similarly for @xmath80 in the limit of a very strong interaction it is convenient to calculate the green function via @xmath73-operators ( using the decoupling procedure @xcite or special diagram technique for @xmath73-operators",

    "this expression describes the arising of separate bands from each intraatomic transition with the change of the electron number from unity .",
    "it is the picture that seems reasonable for e.g. rare - earth materials with very narrow 4f - band .",
    "the bands always appear to be narrowed . indeed ,",

    "a we show the equivalence of the cavity and impurity methods for matrix multiband hamiltonians .",
    "it was realized recently that the success of dmft in the one - band half - filled hubbard model with simplest second - order self - energy is related to the fact that both small and large u - limits are exact in this case @xcite .",

    "an interesting feature of this two - band model is seen in moving the peak from occupied @xmath154-bandstowards the fermi level with increasing correlation strength @xmath30 , and a pinning of the van - hove peak from the @xmath174-band just above fermi level .",
    "this drastic change of the @xmath174- and @xmath154- band - shape maximize the particle - hole interband susceptibility ( inversely proportional to the energy distance between band peaks ) and therefore increase the fluctuation contribution to flex - energy .",
    "the value of the average inverse mass enhancement factor @xmath183 _ { \\epsilon = 0}^{-1}$ ] is equal to 0.45 and 0.83 for @xmath174 and @xmath154 orbitals for u=4 .",
    "spectral function @xmath184 for three different @xmath102-directions in two - dimensional brillouin zone is shown in fig.[akfl4 ] .",
    "one could see the renormalized dispersion of two bands : @xmath174-band from approximately -5 ev at x - point to 5 ev at m - point and @xmath154-band from approximately -8 ev at x - point to 3 ev at m - point .",
    "similar to all high - t@xmath5 models@xcite there is an extended van - hove singularity in @xmath174-bands just at the fermi energy near x - point .",
    "the results of self - consistent dmft calculations for @xmath143 and @xmath179 are presents in fig.[dosdm ] . in this case",
    "we use only first seven matsubara frequencies in the eq.[bom ] and the constant b - matrix for the rest frequencies .",
    "one can clearly see some differences to the corresponding flex results , which is related to a sharpness of the dos near e@xmath182 and more pronounced three peak structure of partial @xmath174-band dos for u=8 .",
    "we plot also the dos corresponding to the atomic green function for u=8 with the four poles near to fermi energy out of eight poles in the paramagnetic two - orbital atom . corresponding spectral function for the same directions in brillouin zone is presents in the fig.[akdm8 ] for u=8 .",
    "there is a sharp quasiparticle dispersion near the fermi level and broad incoherent background above @xmath185 at the energy of about 7 ev near m - point .",
    "extended van - hove singularity at x - point become more pronounced .",
    "we plot also the momentum distribution function @xmath186 in ( 1,1 ) direction in the fig.[nkdm8 ] . from the quasiparticle dispersion of the @xmath174-band along @xmath187 direction ( fig.[akdm8 ] ) , we expect the fermi surface crossing almost exactly at the half - way between this two points .",
    "the momentum distribution function ( fig.[nkdm8 ] ) just confirm this situations and shows that the fermi step ( our simulation temperature t=0.06 t ) is smaller than one and agree with the calculated value of the mass renormalization factor z=0.43 for @xmath174-band .",
    "finally the hia - solution for this two - band model for @xmath188 is shown in fig.[dosh1 ] . in this case",
    "we have the dielectric dos with narrow atomic - like resonances .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the structure of the atomic green function in the dmft approximation ( fig.[dosdm ] ) quite close to the hia - solution shifted approximately by 2 ev down .",
    "we would like to mention that the application of hia - scheme is reasonable only for u@xmath189w and not for u = w as in this case .",
    "the self - consistent lda++ calculation for real systems pose a serious computational problem .",
    "one need to operate with the susceptibility matrix , which is of dimension @xmath190 and depends on the matsubara frequencies . for a illustrative purpose",
    "we have calculated the electronic structure of classical mott - hubbard insulator nio and mixed valence 4f - compound tmse in hia scheme for lda++ .",
    "we use non - selfconsistent hia approximation with the simplest constrain for only diagonal @xmath191 in eq.[h - at ] to have @xmath192 for nio or @xmath193 electrons for tmse from self - consistent paramagnetic lda - calculations .",
    "the coulomb matrix is expressed via effective slater integrals : @xmath194 where @xmath195 and    @xmath196    we used the following effective slater parameters , which define screened coulomb interaction in d - shell for nio : @xmath197 ev , @xmath198 ev , @xmath199 ev , and in f - shell for tmse : @xmath200 ev , @xmath201 ev , @xmath202 ev , @xmath203 ev , ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we start from the non - magnetic lda calculations in the lmto nearly - orthogonal representation@xcite for experimental crystal structures of nio and tmse .",
    "the minimal basis set of @xmath204-orbitals for nio and @xmath205- orbitals for tmse corresponds to 18x18 and 32x32 matrix of the lda hamiltonian @xmath206 .",
    "the occupation number for correlated electrons are 8.4 electrons in the d - shell of ni and 12.6 electrons if the 4f - shell of tm . using the corresponding atomic self energy for ni - atom and tm - atom the total dos for nio and tmse",
    "have been calculated from eq.[hub-1 ] . in fig.[nio",
    "] we compare the paramagnetic lda results with hia lda++ scheme .",
    "it is well known that paramagnetic lda calculations can not produce the insulating gap in nickel oxide : the fermi level located in the middle of the half - filled @xmath207 bands@xcite . in the hia approximation to lda++ approach",
    "there is a gap ( or pseudogap in the fig[nio ] due to temperature broadening ) of the order of 3.5 ev even in this `` nonmagnetic '' state .",
    "this gap and the satellites at -5 and -8 ev are related to the structure of atomic green function shown in the lower panel of the fig.[nio ] .    in fig.[tmse",
    "] we compare the calculated dos for tmse with experimental xps spectrum @xcite . the hia approximation in this case",
    "well reproduces the ladder - type photoemission spectrum , comes mainly from combinations of two multiplets structure of tm@xmath208 and tm@xmath209 .",
    "this example demonstrate how the lda++ scheme can combine the many - body atomic physics with band structure methods .",
    "normal lda - band structure for rare - earth systems corresponds to the narrow f - peak at the fermi level and could not describe the experimental xps - spectrum which has the `` f''-resonances over wide energy range of the order of 12 ev . at the same time , hia is not adequate to describe correctly the fine features of the electron structure near the fermi level .",
    "it is known @xcite that tmse is really the narrow - gap semiconductor . according to the most developed model approach to mixed - valence semiconductors @xcite the appearance of this energy gap",
    "is caused by both hybridization and exciton effects due to the coulomb attraction of 5d conduction electron and 4f hole .",
    "this effect can not be described in hia approximation .",
    "nevertheless we believe that the description of the electronic structure of f compounds including mixed - valence ones on the large energy scales is important itself and in this sense the results presented here demonstrate the usefulness of lda++ approach for the description of real strongly correlated systems .",
    "we have formulate a general lda++ scheme which takes into account dynamical electron fluctuations in the case of correlated d- or f - states . the most accurate approach is the dmft - band structure method , while more simple flex and hia scheme can be as well useful for investigation of correlation effects in real systems , in the cases of rather weak and rather strong interaction respectively . in principle",
    "one could combine the idea of the bath - green function in dmft - scheme with the simple expression for the self - energy in the flex approximation . in this case",
    "@xmath210 $ ] and we expected effectively reduce the effects of vertex - corrections in the flex scheme .",
    "here we compare the lda++ approach with more simple lda+u one .",
    "first of all , to describe mott insulators in lda+u approach ( as well as in sic approach ) it is necessary to assume magnetic and ( or ) orbital ordering @xcite . in lda++",
    "it is possible to consider the _ paramagnetic _",
    "mott insulators in the framework of _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "moreover , it is possible to obtain not only the mott - hubbard gap in the electron spectrum but also satellites and multiplet structure ( see e.g. the results for tmse and nio in the previous section ) .",
    "the correlation effects results from the frequency dependence of the self energy ( the non - fermi - step form of the distribution function for quasiparticles , the mass enhancement , the appearance of many - electron kondo resonanses etc ) can be obtained and investigated in lda++ approach but not in lda+u .",
    "our results for two - band model provide the interesting examples of such behavior . in particular it is worthwhile to note such features as the narrowing of the van hove singularity and its `` pinning '' to the fermi level ( which is important for the physics of high tc superconductors@xcite and can be described already in multiband flex approximation ) , the `` three - peak '' structure of the spectrum in the vicinity of mott insulators ( `` kondo resonance '' and mid - gap states which can be described in dmft approach ) .",
    "we hope that the approximations described here may be useful for the _ ab initio _ calculations of electron structure of a great variety of strongly correlated electron systems including doped mott insulators , rare - earth metals and their compounds ( in particular mixed - valence ones ) , high - temperature superconductors and many others .",
