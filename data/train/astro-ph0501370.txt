    "chemical evolution models ( cem ) @xcite were early developed to try to understand the origin of the radial gradients of abundances , observed in our galaxy ( mwg ) .",
    "most numerical models in the literature , including the multiphase model used in this work , explain the existence of this radial gradient by the combined effects of a star formation rate ( sfr ) and an infall of gas which vary with galactocentric radius in the galaxy",
    ".    a radial decrease of abundances has also been observed in most spiral galaxies @xcite although the shape of the radial distribution changes from galaxy to galaxy . among other global trends",
    "it is found that for isolated non - barred spirals the steepness of the radial gradient depends on morphological type , with later types showing steeper gradients @xcite , with other general galaxy properties as surface brightness and neutral and molecular gas fractions also playing a role @xcite .",
    "the radial gradient tends to be wiped out however for strongly barred galaxies which show flat abundance distributions @xcite .",
    "irregulars galaxies also show uniform abundances throughout @xcite .",
    "the abundance gradient pattern seems to show an on - off mode @xcite , being very steep for the latest spiral types and very flat for irregulars .",
    "all these considerations become clear when the gradient is measured in dex / kpc , but there are indications that suggest a gradient independent of galaxy type when it is measured in dex / scale length @xcite . in order to analyze the behaviour of the radial distribution of abundances and the value of the radial gradient from a theoretical point of view a large number of models",
    "is necessary .",
    "historically , cem aiming to reproduce radial abundance gradients have been , however , applied only to the mwg .",
    "actually , there is a lack of tools to determine the chemical evolutionary state of a particular galaxy , besides our works applying the multiphase models to spiral galaxies .",
    "the recent works by @xcite are valid for galaxies other than the mwg .",
    "their calculations use the angular momentum and rotation curves as model inputs keeping the star formation efficiency constant for all galaxies @xcite .",
    "this technique may not be flexible enough to validate the models against observational data .",
    "in fact , a comparison to see if these models reproduce the observed abundance radial distributions of particular galaxies has not been done . it is always possible to extract some information by using evolutionary synthesis models in comparison with spectro - photometric observations .",
    "this method , very useful for the study of elliptical galaxies , does not result equally successful in the case of spiral galaxies due to the difficulty of measuring the spectral indices , except for the bulges @xcite , from which ages and metallicities are obtained .",
    "furthermore , even when these measurements are done with confidence @xcite , in order to apply this technique to spiral galaxies , a combination of chemical evolution and evolutionary synthesis models is required to solve the uniqueness problem associated to the first ones and the age - metallicity degeneracy associated to the second ones @xcite .    at present , the available options are either to use the classical closed box model or a galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) model .",
    "however , the closed box scenario is recognised to be inadequate to describe the evolution of most galaxies and in fact its application in many cases can yield misleading results @xcite .",
    "in particular , the fact of assuming that a system has a constant total mass with a monotonically decreasing star formation according to a schmidt law , prevents the reproduction of the observational characteristics of most galaxies . on the other hand , the evolution of a galaxy with present time properties different from the milky way will not necessarily be equal to that predicted by a gce model .",
    "realistic chemical evolution models adequate to describe different types of spiral and irregular galaxies are therefore clearly needed .",
    "the multiphase model , whose characteristics have been described in @xcite , has been applied and checked against observational constraints not only for the milky way galaxy @xcite , as it is commonly done , but also for a sample of spiral galaxies ( discs and bulges ) of different morphological types and total masses @xcite .",
    "the observed radial distributions of gas , oxygen abundances and star formation rate have been reproduced rather successfully and the observed correlations between abundance gradients and galaxy characteristics are also reproduced @xcite .",
    "this galaxy sample , which includes the best studied objects , is however small ( only 11 ) and encompasses a restricted range of morphologies and masses .",
    "the application of the model can however be extended to a larger sample if an adequate parameter space is defined thus providing the required chemical evolution of different types of galaxies .",
    "the model uses as input parameters the collapse time scale to form the disc , which depends on the total mass of the galaxy , and the efficiencies to form molecular clouds and stars which we assume different from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the radial distributions of total mass constitute the fundamental input of the multiphase model .",
    "they are easily computed when the rotation curves are available ( moll & mrquez , in preparation ) .",
    "if this is not the case , some assumptions are necessary . in this work",
    ", we have used the universal rotation curve from ( * ? ? ? * hereafter pss96 ) to calculate a large number of mass radial distributions representing theoretical protogalaxies or initial structures which will evolve to form the observed spiral discs or irregulars .",
    "the total mass of each simulated galaxy , besides having its own effect on the galaxy evolution , defines the characteristic collapse time - scale or gas infall rate onto the disc .",
    "regarding molecular cloud and star formation efficiencies , which will take values between 0 and 1 , we have chosen 10 different sets of values for each radial distribution of total mass .",
    "we have computed how the chemical evolution proceeds for galaxies defined by the different parameter combinations .",
    "the final bi - parametric grid consists of 440 models simulating galaxies of 44 different total masses .",
    "this work represents an extension of our previous work that can help to understand the general trends observed in spiral and irregular galaxies concerning neutral and molecular gas distributions , abundance radial distributions etc .",
    "but , most importantly , by using these models we can predict the time evolution of a galaxy when only present time data are known .    in section 2",
    "we summarize the general characteristics of the multiphase chemical evolution model and the strategy of its application to the objects of the grid .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 including the time evolution of galaxies and some radial distributions for the present time . in section 4",
    "we give the calibration of the grid models with the mwg and a restricted sample of well studied spiral galaxies and we discuss the model results in a global way .",
    "finally , the conclusions of this work are presented in section 5 .",

    "the relative normalization of the halo , thick and thin disc surface mass densities @xcite gives an approximated proportion of 1:22:200 , which implies that the halo surface mass density must be about 1/100 that of the disc component , also in agreement with the ratio obtained by the multiphase model .",

    "solid dots represent the values used in our previous models for individual spiral galaxies @xcite .    an important consequence of the hypothesis linking the collapse time scale with the total mass , is that low mass galaxies take more time to form their discs , in apparent contradiction with the standard hierarchical picture of galaxy formation .",
    "this characteristic is , however , essential to reproduce most observational features of spiral and irregular galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , recent self - consistent hydrodynamical simulations in the context of a cosmological model @xcite show that a large proportion of massive objects are formed at early times ( high redshift ) while the formation of less massive ones is more extended in time , thus simulating a modern version of the monolithic collapse scenario ( * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , this assumption is supported by various sets of observations @xcite which seem to demonstrate that a large proportion ( @xmath44 % ) of the massive galaxies formed their stars at @xmath45 while a much smaller proportion of the less massive ones have converted their baryon mass into stars at that redshift .",
    "it is evident that the collapse time - scale must vary with galactocentric radius .",

    "if the collapse time - scale is larger than this value , there is not enough time for all the gas to fall onto the disc : only a small part of it has moved from the halo to the equatorial plane and the disc formation is not yet complete .",
    "this could correspond to the situation observed by @xcite , who have found an extended component of hi , different from the cold disc , located in the halo , rotating more slowly than the disc and with radial inward motion .",

    "moreover , a stimulated star formation process , proportional to a parameter @xmath63 , is assumed .",
    "an advantage of using our model is that it includes a more realistic star formation than classic chemical galactic evolution ones in which the sfr prescriptions are based on a schmidt law , depending on the total gas surface density .",
    "instead , the multiphase model assumes a star formation which takes place in two - steps : first , the formation of molecular clouds ; then the formation of stars .",
    "this simulates a power law for the gas density with an exponent @xmath64 and with a threshold gas density as shown by @xcite , and , more importantly , it allows the calculation of the two different gas phases present in the interstellar medium .",
    "in fact , the actual process of star formation , born by observations @xcite , is closer to our scenario with stars forming in regions where there are molecular clouds , than to the classical schmidt law which depends only on the total gas density .",
    "our assumed sfr implies that some feedback mechanisms are included naturally and are sufficient to simulate the actually observed process of creation of stars from the interstellar medium .",
    "the formed massive stars induce the creation of new ones .",
    "but , at the same time , these star formation processes also may destroy the diffuse or molecular clouds , thus preventing the total conversion of gas into stars and ejecting more gas once again into the ism point ( v). in particular , massive stars destroy the molecular clouds that surround them , due to the sensitivity of molecular cloud condensation to the uv radiation @xcite .",
    "this mechanism restores gas to the ism , thus decreasing the star formation .",

    "the free parameters @xmath58 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , proportionality constants in our star and cloud formation laws , but variable for each radial region , are computed through the efficiencies , which represent the efficiencies of star formation in the halo , @xmath73 , cloud formation , @xmath74 , cloud  cloud collision , @xmath75 , and interaction of massive stars with clouds , @xmath76 , in the disc . only a given efficiency for each process must be selected for the whole galaxy , although the original parameters , and its corresponding processes , maintain their radial dependence .",
    "the term associated to the induced star formation describes a local process and , as a result , its coefficient @xmath76 is considered independent of the galaxy modelled and the location in it .",
    "the term @xmath73 is also assumed constant for all haloes .",
    "therefore , for all our 440 models , both efficiencies take the same values already used in our previous model for the mwg .",
    "only the other two efficiencies @xmath74 and @xmath75 are allowed to vary for each galaxy , being characteristic for each one of them . within each galaxy @xmath75 and @xmath74",
    "are independent of the position .",
    "the fact that galaxies with the same gravitational potential or mass but different morphological type or appearance exist , implies that the evolution of a galaxy does not depend solely on gravitation , even if this may be the most important factor , but also on certain dynamical conditions .",
    "these conditions can not be taken into account , obviously , in a simple chemical evolution model , but may change the evolution of a galaxy , ( mostly the star formation rate through temperature variations ) .",
    "we may consider them as included in our efficiencies to form molecular clouds and stars , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which are allowed to change from one galaxy to another .",
    "we assume that @xmath74 and @xmath75 vary between 0 and 1 , according with its efficiency meaning . in principle",
    "both parameters should be allowed to vary independently from each other , what would increase very much the number of models to be calculated .",
    "furthermore , some of those models will not be physically possible .",
    "on the other hand , on the basis of our previous works , a trend between both efficiencies seems to exist , increasing or decreasing together for a given galaxy respect to the values appropriate for the mwg model .",
    "we have therefore studied the observational data related to molecular cloud and star formation from the available gas in order to check if a correlation between these two processes exists .",
    "to this aim we have used the data from @xcite which correspond to a large sample of galaxies and refer to atomic and molecular gas masses and to luminosities in the ir band and in h@xmath77 emission , two well known indicators of the star formation rate . with them , we have tried to establish if some correlation appears among our efficiencies , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "since the modelled star formation rate have two steps to form stars , we will analyse the transformation of diffuse gas in molecular gas and of the conversion of the molecular clouds into stars .    from equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , our parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 , efficiencies of transforming the diffuse gas in molecular clouds and forming stars out of them , can be written as : @xmath78 while from equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) we have : @xmath79    in these expressions the subscript @xmath80 has been omitted , since in all cases we refer to the disc .",

    "we now analyse the present time results obtained with this bi - parametric grid of models . in order to do this , we start presenting only the present time radial distributions of gas , oxygen abundances and star formation rate which we will analyse in the following subsections .",
    "the radial distribution of gas and elemental abundances provide two basic model constraints since they are easily extracted from observations .",
    "in addition , in many cases , the star formation surface density and/or the surface brightness can also be derived .      the radial distribution of atomic gas surface density for the present time is shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the atomic gas surface density shows a maximum somewhere along the disc , as it is usually observed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and see fig.[chequeo ] ) .",
    "the value of this maximum depends on n : the models with the highest efficiencies have smaller gas quantities and their maximum densities are around 3 - 4 m@xmath145 . for intermediate efficiencies ( @xmath146 )",
    ", these maximum values rise to @xmath147 m@xmath145 . for all efficiencies the radial distributions are very similar independently of their galactic mass , except for those corresponding to @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) which show much lower densities , except in the central region .",
    "in fact , a characteristic shown by all distributions is the similarity among models of the same efficiencies but different total mass , only scaled by their different optical radius . with the exception of the @xmath150 model ,",
    "all the others show , for a same n , differences small enough as to simulate a dispersion of the data .    for the less evolved theoretical galaxies ( n @xmath151 ) , the neutral gas distribution display a clear dependence on galactic mass .",
    "the maximum density values are always large , as expected , due to the small efficiencies to form molecular clouds , which do not allow the consumption of the diffuse gas , but this maximum density increases from @xmath152 for @xmath150 ( @xmath153 ) to @xmath154 for @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) and up to @xmath157 for @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "the consequence of a shorter collapse time - scale for the more massive spirals is clearly seen : the maximum is located at radii further away from the centre due to the exhaustion of the diffuse gas in the inner disc which moves the star formation outside . the smaller the galaxy mass , the closer to the centre is the maximum of the distribution , which resembles an exponential , except for the inner region .",
    "in fact , a shift in the maximum appears in each panel . in some cases , however , the low values of the surface gas density are due to the fact that the gas did not have enough time to fall completely onto the equatorial disc .",
    "this effect is very clear for the model with @xmath150 which shows a very steep distribution with gas densities lower than 15 @xmath160 . in this case",
    "the gas shows a radial distribution with a maximum at the centre .",
    "the low density out of this central region is not due to the creation of stars but to the long collapse time - scale which prevents the infall of the sufficient gas to be observed .    besides the variations due to the differences in total mass , which correspond to different collapse time - scales , and",
    "because we have selected different efficiencies to form stars and molecular clouds , a same total mass may have produced discs in different evolutionary states .",
    "thus , a same @xmath161 may result in a disc of 7 - 8 kpc and atomic gas densities around 5 @xmath160 , or a disc of only 5 kpc with a maximum density of 40 @xmath160 in the region of 2 kpc . in the same way",
    ", a galaxy with a large value of the total mass , as the one with @xmath162 , may show a high gas mass density and a little disc for a high value of n or , on the contrary , be very evolved and therefore show no gas and a large stellar disc if the value of n is low . the first object ( @xmath163 )",
    "could correspond to the case of low surface brightness galaxies , while the last ones ( @xmath164 ) could be identified as the typical high surface brightness spiral galaxies .",
    "an important success of the multiphase models has been the ability to reproduce the radial distributions for the atomic gas and the molecular gas separately , which is possible due to the assumed star formation prescription in two steps , thus allowing the formation of molecular clouds prior to the appearance of stars .",
    "another important consequence of this sfr law is that it takes into account feedback mechanisms , even negative . if molecular clouds form before stars , this implies a delay in the time of star formation .",
    "the molecular gas shows an evolution similar to that of the diffuse gas , but with a certain delay . this delay allows the maintenance of a radial distribution with an exponential shape , as usually observed , for a longer time , although in some evolved galaxies @xmath165 is also consumed in the most central regions , thus reproducing the so - called central _",
    "hole _ of the molecular gas radial distribution , observed in some galaxies @xcite , the mwg being one of them ( see fig6b in next section ) .",
    "this is seen in fig.[h2 ] for efficiencies corresponding to @xmath166 , ( depending on the total mass ) , for which the model lines turn over at the inner disc , which corresponds to the regions located at the border between bulge and disc .",
    "thus , the galaxies with the highest efficiencies ( @xmath167 ) show a maximum in their radial distribution of @xmath168 , which is always closer to the centre than that of the atomic gas distribution .",
    "galaxies with the lowest efficiencies ( @xmath166 ) show larger surface densities of molecular than atomic gas because the efficiency to form stars from molecular clouds is smaller than the efficiency to form these clouds .",
    "therefore , the conversion of diffuse to molecular gas occurs more rapidly that the subsequent formation of stars .      the total mass converted into stars forms out the stellar disc in each galaxy .",
    "these stellar discs are represented in fig.[profiles ] as the stellar surface density radial distributions .",
    "these profiles may be compared with brightness surface radial distributions , after the appropriate conversions .",
    "the values of efficiencies have a small influence in the resulting stellar surface density distribution shape : the total mass of stars created is similar for all n @xmath169 , although they are formed at different rates , that is the resulting stellar populations have different mean ages .",
    "for the most evolved cases , most stars were created very rapidly , while for the less evolved ones , stars formed later as average , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ sfrt_rc ] for the characteristic radius region .",
    "therefore , the radial distributions of surface brightness would result very similar for galaxies of a given galactic total mass , but colors are expected to be different , redder for the galaxies with the highest efficiencies for the formation of stars and molecular clouds .",
    "a very interesting result is that the central value of the distribution is practically the same , around 100 m@xmath145 , for all rotation curves and efficiencies , in agreement with freeman s law .",
    "only galaxies with the smallest efficiencies or the less massive discs show central densities smaller than this value .",
    "we can not compute a surface brightness only with these models , but assuming a ratio @xmath170 for the stellar populations , this implies a surface luminosity density of @xmath171 and scale lengths in agreement with observed generic trends . only in models for n@xmath172",
    "the stellar discs show a different appearance : they look less massive , as corresponding to discs in the process of formation .",
    "this implies that the surface brightness is lower than for the other types for a similar characteristic total mass .    in any case",
    ", we remind that all information related to photometric quantities , and this also applies to the disc scale lengths , which may be obtained from the star formation histories and enrichment relations of models , need the application of evolutionary synthesis models , what is out of the scope of this work .",
    "one of the most important results of this grid of models refers to the oxygen abundances , shown in fig .",
    "a radial gradient appears for most of models .",
    "this is due to the different evolutionary rates along radius : the inner regions evolve more rapidly that the outer ones , thus steepening the radial gradient very soon for most model galaxies",
    ". then , the radial gradient flattens for the more massive and/or most evolved ( small n ) galaxies due to the rapid evolution , even in the outer regions , which produces a large quantity of elements , with the oxygen abundance reaching a saturation level .",
    "this level is found to be around @xmath173 dex .",
    "observations in the inner disc of our galaxy support this statement @xcite .",
    "this result was already found in our previous works .",
    "moreover , the larger the mass of the galaxy , the faster the effect : a galaxy with @xmath174 km.s@xmath40 has a flat radial gradient for efficiencies corresponding to n@xmath175 1 or 2 , while a galaxy with v@xmath176 km.s@xmath40 , shows a flat distribution for @xmath177 .",
    "the less massive galaxies maintain a steeper radial distribution of oxygen for almost all efficiencies , with very similar values of the gradients .    nevertheless , for any galaxy mass , if @xmath178 the radial abundances distribution are flat .",
    "thus , the less evolved galaxies show no gradient , such it is observed in lsb galaxies @xcite , the intermediate ones show steep gradients , and the most evolved galaxies have , once again , flat abundance radial distributions .",
    "the largest values of radial gradients correspond to the intermediate evolutionary type galaxies , with the limiting n varying according to the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "the more massive galaxies only show a significant radial gradient if n@xmath179 while the less massive ones have a flat gradient only if @xmath180 with the rest having very pronounced radial gradients even for @xmath181 .    for the evolved galaxies , the characteristic efficiencies are high for all the disc , thus producing a high and early star formation in all radial regions .",
    "in this case , the oxygen abundance reaches very soon a saturation level , flattening the radial gradient developed at early times of the evolution . the characteristic oxygen abundance , measured at r@xmath182 , is higher for the more massive galaxies and lower for the less massive ones .",
    "however , this correlation is not apparent when the central abundance is used , due to the existence of the saturation level in the oxygen abundance , which produces a flattening of the radial gradient in the inner disc , even for galaxies with intermediate efficiencies .",
    "actually , this saturation level would correspond to the integrated yield of oxygen for a single stellar population . as oxygen",
    "is ejected by the most massive stars of a generation of stars , it appears rapidly in the ism .",
    "it is therefore impossible to surpass this level of abundance .",
    "in fact , the oxygen abundance radial distribution shows sometimes a bad fit to observations in the central parts of the discs , which give frequently abundances larger than 9.10 dex .",
    "this absolute value of the oxygen abundance is not reached in any case by the models .",
    "all the computations performed within the multiphase approach reach a maximum @xmath183 dex which no model can exceed .",
    "we might think that uncertainties in the calculations of the stellar yields elements , still very dependent on the assumed evolution of stars , are a possible reason for this saturation level appears in theoretical models .",
    "however , low and intermediate mass stars , for which yields show large variations among the different groups ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , depending on the assumed hypothesis in the calculation of the stellar evolution in the latest stellar evolutionary phases , do not produce oxygen ; these calculations only affect to n and c abundances . on the other hand ,",
    "the most important uncertainty for the production of oxygen in massive stars refers to the strength of stellar winds responsible for stellar mass loss .",
    "this mass loss implies less production of oxygen and a larger ejection of carbon . in our models",
    "we have used woosley & weaver s yields which do no include stellar winds .",
    "therefore , from this point of view , the modelled oxygen abundances must be considered upper limits .",
    "it should be recalled , however , that all oxygen data yielding values larger than 9.1 dex have been obtained from observations of hii regions where the electronic temperature could not be measured , and hence the oxygen abundances have been derived through empirical calibrations which are very uncertain in the high abundance regime .",
    "actually , the shape of the radial distribution of oxygen changes depending on the calibration used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the suspicion that these abundances are overestimated at least by 0.2 dex is very reasonable @xcite .",
    "abundance estimates in hii regions historically considered as metal - rich , result to be almost solar once the electronic temperature has been finally measured @xcite .",
    "radial distributions of star formation rate surface density show an exponential shape in the outer disc , but a less clear one in the inner regions , where some models show a distribution flatter than that of the molecular gas , and even decreasing toward low values of the star formation rate in the centre .",
    "these sfr radial distributions are very similar to those estimated by @xcite from h@xmath77 fluxes , as we show in fig.[chequeo ] for a few galaxies .",
    "the star formation rate assumed in our models do not produce bursts of massive stars in the low mass galaxies whatever the efficiencies . only the massive galaxies are able to keep a large quantity of gas in a small region , usually at the centre although sometimes at the inner disc regions . on the contrary",
    ", low mass galaxies collapse very slowly , and thus the star formation rate maintains a low level during the whole life of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , recent works suggest the same scenario for both low mass and low surface brightness galaxies @xcite in order to take into account the observed data . our resulting abundances and gas fractions for low mass galaxies seem to be in rough agreement with these findings @xcite ,",

    "it , however , fits well the most recent data obtained from @xcite for radii r@xmath186 kpc . regarding the molecular gas density , panel b ) , the distribution is quasi - exponential from @xmath187 kpc and decreases at the inner disc regions . taking into account that recent data give low densities at these inner regions , we consider that our model results may be adequate .",
    "the stellar mass distribution , panel c ) , is exponential in shape in agreement with the surface brightness distribution , and radial distributions , panels e ) and f ) , reproduce those shown by the most recent data .",
    "the only feature which is not well reproduced by the model is the sfr radial distribution shown in panel d ) , which decreases toward the inner disc in apparent discrepancy with observations .",
    "the modelled star formation rate distribution has a maximum in @xmath188 kpc , while the observed one increases exponentially toward the galactic centre , or levels off at 3 - 4 kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum of the atomic gas density is observed around 10 - 11 kpc , and the molecular gas density has its maximum observed at around 6 kpc .",
    "therefore , it results difficult to explain , from an observational point of view , how the star formation rate remains so high at the inner disc ( inside the central 3 - 4 kpc ) , where both gas phases are already consumed .",
    "in fact , the recent data from @xcite show a decline for r@xmath189 kpc and a decreasing star formation rate for the inner disc regions is also observed in a large number of galaxies , as we will see in the next section . actually , the mwg radial distribution of the present star formation rate is still a matter of discussion @xcite since the detection of young sources , which are embedded in gas clouds , is difficult and might be affected by selection effects .",
    "data from pulsars , supernovae or ob star formation @xcite seem to indicate that the radial distribution of the sfr has a maximum around 5 kpc , decreasing toward both smaller and larger radii . on the other hand @xcite obtained a much flatter distribution from the observed cosmic rays and gamma radiation spectra . since a decrease at the inner disc is not unreasonable from the comparison with other spiral galaxy data , we consider that the model results for the mwg are acceptable",

    "thus the good agreement found between model results and data demonstrate that our bi - parametric models are able to adequately reproduce real galaxies .",
    "the computed star formation rate reproduces the relation obtained by @xcite , when it is represented _ vs _ the total gas surface density as can be seen in fig .",

    "models with @xmath142 seem to be out of the region where this data lie .",
    "however , due to their extremely low efficiencies , we may assume that these models do not simulate normal bright spiral galaxies , but other kind of objects with a low stellar content and high gas fractions more similar to dwarf and lsb galaxies .",
    "we have , therefore , taken data from @xcite on these kinds of objects and computed the densities for both quantities assuming an optical radius of 5 kpc for all of them .",
    "obviously , a change in this radial dimension would vary the final values of our estimates , but our hypothesis is probably valid within a factor of 2 ( radii less than 10 kpc ) . under this assumption",
    ", we see that the points , shown in the third panel of fig.[ken ] , fall in the upper locus defined by the models .",
    "if the radius were smaller than assumed , the densities would be even higher , and the points would move in the figure following the direction given by the arrow . a second factor not included in these estimates ,",
    "is the molecular gas content .",
    "there are some works suggesting that the molecular gas amounts to less than 10% in this kind of galaxies while other seems to indicate that the molecular mass may be as large as in the brightest massive spirals . in any case",
    ", the inclusion of this factor would move the points to the right . in both cases",
    "the data points would populate the region of the diagram occupied by the models .",
    "we therefore conclude that our models are able to reproduce the observed trend of sfr _ vs _ total gas surface density for different types of galaxies .",
    "the model computed abundance radial gradients for oxygen have been obtained by fitting a least squares straigh line to the oxygen abundances for radii @xmath195 kpc .",
    "the chosen radial range tries to eliminate the central region ( where the oxygen abundance distribution flattens ) and the outer region where there are no data .",
    "thus the calculated gradients may be compared more precisely with the corresponding observed ones .",
    "these radial gradients , measured as dex / kpc , are represented as a function of rotation velocity in fig .",
    "the relation between both quantities shows that the radial distributions are steeper for the models with lower rotation velocities if n@xmath196 .",
    "the radial gradients for a given rotation velocity are larger in absolute value for increasing n , and tend to zero value for the most massive galaxies and low n. the models with @xmath197 , however , tend to deviate from this function and show lower absolute values .",
    "that is , for a similar rotation curve , their radial distributions of abundances show a flattening as compared to those corresponding to the models with @xmath198 .",
    "the rotation velocity at which the models deviate from the common locus depends on @xmath199 : for @xmath200 it occurs for @xmath201 while for @xmath202 almost all rotation velocity curves produce flat radial gradients of abundances .",
    "data from @xcite are over - plotted on this fig .",
    "we see that the modelled trend reproduce the observations , although a more profound analysis about this ( and other ) correlation will be performed in the future .      in order to use this grid for a given galaxy for which observational data are known",
    ", we must first select the radial distribution of mass .",
    "this means that we must know the total mass , the maximum rotation velocity or , if none of them is available , the luminosity or the magnitude in the i band . according to this value",
    "we may choose the number of the distribution from table  [ grid_m ] .",
    "then , 10 different models , corresponding to the 10 different efficiencies , are available",
    ".    the standard procedure in chemical evolution would be to see which of them is able to reproduce with success known data such as elemental abundances or gas densities .",
    "if more than one observational constraint is available , some kind of minimum error or maximum probability technique may be used for the purpose of choosing the best model .",
    "once this selection is performed we may use the time evolution given by the chosen model to predict the star formation history , the age - metallicity relation , the stellar populations or any other quantity relative to the modelled galaxy .",
    "obviously , the largest the observational number of constraints , the smallest the uncertainty in the selection of the best model .",
    "the old and well known uniqueness problem of the chemical evolution suggest that more than one model may reproduce the data .",
    "actually , we have shown in @xcite that this problem reduces greatly when more than two observational constraints can be used .",
    "only 4% of the 500 models computed with with different input parameters could reproduce the observations relative to hi , oxygen abundance and sfr at the same time . therefore we are confident that models may provide the evolutionary history of a given galaxy within a reasonable accuracy .    sometimes , however , these observational constraints are not available ( or not with sufficient precision ) to select the adequate model . in that case , some other method to choose the possible evolutionary track is necessary .",
    "our best models from previous works give us evidence that the efficiencies to form molecular clouds from atomic gas and stars from molecular gas , seem to depend on the galaxy morphological type .",
    "if this were the case , the selection of the best model might be easier .",
    "in fact , this dependence was already found in @xcite , where these authors quantified the efficiencies to form molecular clouds and the frequency of cloud - cloud collisions , finding that a variation of 10 in the parameters h and @xmath61 is needed when the hubble type changes from one stage to the next ( sa to sb , etc .. ) .    in order to check if a relation between efficiencies and morphological type exists , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ emu1 ] , panel a ) the logarithmic efficiency @xmath74 , computed following the equation ( 19 ) from section 2.3 , as a function of t for the data of @xcite .",
    "there @xmath105 symbols correspond to the raw values while solid dots represent the averaged values obtained for 10 bins , one for each t. a clear decreasing correlation appears for @xmath203 .",
    "values for @xmath204 fall above the trend but the number of points is small for what we assume that the final increase is probably spurious . based on our previous works , we expect a relation of the form : @xmath205 . therefore , in panel",
    "b ) we have plotted the logarithmic efficiency as a function of @xmath206 where a linear correlation is apparent .",
    "a least - squares fit gives , for @xmath203 :    @xmath207    therefore : @xmath208    on the other hand , taking into account the relationship obtained for the ratio between both efficiencies , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , this latter one may also be expressed by a similar function : @xmath209 where b would be 8 , following our hypothesis from section 2 .",
    "the result that efficiencies are related to galaxy morphological type may be useful when a model for a given galaxy must be chosen and the observational data are scarce . in that case ,",
    "once the total mass distribution has been selected from the rotation curve or the luminosity for the galaxy , an initial choice can be made under the assumption that the galaxy evolution is represented by the model of efficiencies n with @xmath210 .",
    "we warn , however , that given the large dispersion of the data around the averaged efficiency values in fig .",
    "[ emu1 ] , other values of n are also possible .",
    "this finding would imply that the features of spiral galaxies depend at least on two parameters : total mass and morphological type , as some studies about the characteristics of galaxies , as the seminal work by @xcite , show ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among those more related with the chemical evolution of galaxies ) .",
    "it is also well known that the radial gradient , measured as dex @xmath211 , observed in spiral galaxies depends on morphological type : late - type galaxies show steeper radial distributions of oxygen abundances than earlier ones , which show in some cases almost no gradient @xcite . at the same time , a correlation seems to exist between oxygen abundance and total mass surface density which , in turn , is related to morphological type .",
    "this correlation is stronger when the total mass of the galaxy , including the bulge , instead of the mass of the exponential disc alone , is used @xcite .",
    "it is evident from these works that a linear sequence with the mass can not be obtained , and therefore our models , being a bi - parametric grid , would be adequate to find the best model for each galaxy , although the existing relation between the morphological type of galaxies and their total mass does difficult to discriminate which of these features is the origin of the different evolution of galaxies .    from the chemical evolution point of view , a recent work ( moll & mrquez , in preparation ) , where the multiphase evolution model has been applied to a large sample ( 67 ) of spiral galaxies , seems to demonstrate that the total mass , through its influence on the collapse time scale , has a larger effect on the evolution of a galaxy and its final radial gradient of abundances than the selected values of the named efficiencies .",
    "thus , it seems as if galaxies would evolve mostly due to their total mass with some dispersion around the mean trend depending on hydrodynamical and environmental characteristics , which are taken into account in some way by the efficiencies values .",
    "the morphological type would then be the consequence of the different conditions of the intergalactic medium out of which the galaxy formed .",
    "we have calculated the chemical evolution of a wide set of theoretical galaxies characterised by their total mass , through the collapse time scale , and their efficiencies to form molecular clouds and massive stars from cloud - to - cloud collisions .    with the selection of parameters and inputs described above",
    ", we have ran a total of 440 models , with 44 different rotation curves implying 44 values of total mass , characteristic collapse time - scale and disc radius and 10 sets of efficiencies for each one of them , implying 10 evolutionary rates for the star formation and gas consumption in the disc .    for each model",
    "we have obtained the time evolution of the halo and the disc , and therefore the corresponding radial distributions for the relevant quantities ( masses , abundances , star formation rate , etc ... ) . the star formation history for each radial region ( halo and disc , separately ) and within each one , the mass in each phase of matter : diffuse gas , molecular gas , low - mass stars , massive stars and remnants , has been followed . besides that",
    ", we have obtained the abundances of 15 elements : h , d , he3 , he4 , c12 , c13 , n14 , o16 , ne , mg , si , ca , s , fe and neutron - rich nuclei , in all radial regions for both halo and disc .    the results of our work can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the atomic gas shows a maximum in its radial distribution for all galaxies",
    ". this maximum is nearer to the galaxy centre in the low mass or less evolved galaxies than in the more evolved or massive galaxies , for which the maximum is along the disc and moving toward the outer zones .",
    "this behavior produces , in some cases , a central _ hole _ in the distribution of the diffuse gas .",
    "the diffuse gas radial distribution results to be a very strong constraint for selecting the best model out of the 10 computed ones with different efficiencies , corresponding to the total mass of a given spiral galaxy .",
    "2 .   the oxygen abundance reaches a maximum level , as a consequence of a saturation effect which occurs earlier for the massive and more evolved galaxies .",
    "the less evolved galaxies do not reach this saturation level , except in the central region , and therefore show a steep radial gradient in their oxygen abundance .",
    "the less massive and less evolved galaxies have not yet developed a radial gradient and show flat radial distributions .",
    "this simulates an on - off effect : for @xmath200 a radial gradient appears if @xmath212 while at @xmath213 it only appears for @xmath214 .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with observations and solves the apparent inconsistency shown by trends showing steep gradients for late type galaxies and flatter ones for the earliest ones , while , at the same time , most irregulars show no gradient at all and very uniform abundances .",
    "3 .   the model calculated star formation rates reproduce the observed trend between the surface density of this quantity and the total gas density including , not only the massive normal galaxies data , but also the low surface brightness ones .",
    "actually , to our knowledge , there are not other chemical evolution models which compare predicted with observed radial distributions of diffuse and molecular gas , star formation rate and abundances for disc galaxies other than mwg . in this sense",
    "our models should be considered as an improvement over the standard ones .",
    "a study of the possible correlations among galaxy properties and different features obtained from the complete set of results is now possible , since a statistically significant number of theoretical models is available .",
    "this requires a deeper analysis which is out of the scope of this paper and will be done in the next future .",

    "<S> we present a generalization of the multiphase chemical evolution model applied to a wide set of theoretical galaxies with different masses and evolutionary rates . </S>",
    "<S> this generalized set of models has been computed using the so - called _ universal rotation curve _ from @xcite to calculate the radial mass distribution of 44 _ theoretical _ protogalaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is a fundamental input which , besides its own effect on the galaxy evolution , defines the characteristic collapse time - scale or gas infall rate onto the disc . </S>",
    "<S> we have adopted 10 sets of values , between 0 and 1 , for the molecular cloud and star formation efficiencies , as corresponding to their probability nature , for each one of the radial distributions of total mass . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have constructed a bi - parametric grid of models , depending on those efficiency sets and on the rotation velocity , whose results are valid in principle for any spiral or irregular galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the model results provide the time evolution of different regions of the disc and the halo along galactocentric distance , measured by the gas ( atomic and molecular ) and stellar masses , the star formation rate and chemical abundances of 14 elements , for a total of 440 models . </S>",
    "<S> this grid may be used to estimate the evolution of a given galaxy for which only present time information  such as radial distributions of elemental abundances , gas densities and/or star formation , which are the usual observational constraints of chemical evolution models  is available .    </S>",
