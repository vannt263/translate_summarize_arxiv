    "an electronic excitation delocalizes in a lattice due to resonant dipole - dipole interactions and form an exciton which is a coherent state with wave number @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "then we check if such an exciton can transfer between the two lattices due to resonant dipole - dipole interactions , and if it can coherently oscillate between the two lattices to form a collective electronic excitation in the whole system of the two optical lattices .",

    ", we get @xmath54 here the @xmath55 and @xmath56 components , which are normal to the lattice direction , are repulsive ; and the @xmath47 component , which is parallel to the lattice direction , is attractive . note that using the nearest neighbor interaction in this limit gives @xmath57 .",
    "appendix a.2 includes the calculation for the exciton dynamical matrix for interaction among the two optical lattices , @xmath40 .",
    "the result for the limit of long wavelength excitons , that is @xmath53 , and large distance between the two lattice @xmath58 , namely @xmath59 , is given by @xmath60 here the @xmath47 and @xmath55 terms are repulsive , as they parallel among the different lattices , but as the @xmath47 component is parallel to the lattice direction and the @xmath55 component is normal to it , the contribution of the @xmath47 component is much larger than the @xmath55 one .",
    "the @xmath56 term is attractive , even though these components are normal to the lattice direction they are parallel for different lattices .",
    "approximately the last term is much smaller than the first two , ( or we can assume @xmath61 ) , we get @xmath62 the main result of the present derivation is that the interaction decay exponentially with the distance between the two lattices . in place of the inverse cube dependence of the interaction between two dipoles , the collective effect in each lattice",
    "gives coupling between two excitons which is decay exponentially with the distance .",

    "as the spontaneously emitted photon has wave vector component parallel to the lattice equals to the exciton wave number , the critical wave number is obtained from the conservation energy condition @xmath79 . beyond this critical wave number ,",
    "excitons become metastable with zero radiative damping rate , and they can propagate in the lattice without radiative decay .    in the present system we have two optical lattices , and we showed above that their mutual coupling give rise to symmetric and antisymmetric excitons .",
    "direct calculations yield that the antisymmetric excitons are dark with zero damping rate , that is @xmath80 , while the symmetric excitons are bright with twice the single exciton damping rate , that is @xmath81 .",
    "note that according to the previous discussion , the symmetric exciton damping rate also become zero beyond the critical wave number @xmath82 .",
    "the dark excitons can not be excited directly through the coupling to the fiber photons and needs other methods to excite them .",
    "as we explain in the next section , the symmetric excitons can be excited directly through the electric dipole interaction with the fiber photons , where this coupling appears also for excitons with wave number beyond the critical wave number .",
    "this regime is useful for long range transmission through the system , and the only source of damping will be the fiber photon decay .",

    "the matter - light coupling is given by the electric dipole interaction @xmath94 , and in the rotating wave approximation for linear polarizations , we get @xmath95 where in using the inverse transformation of equation ( [ trans ] ) , we have @xmath96 in using @xmath97 , we obtain @xmath98 we represent the exciton operators in terms of symmetric and antisymmetric operators by using the inverse of the transformation ( [ symm ] ) , to get @xmath99 it is clear that only the symmetric excitons are coupled to the fiber photons , where the antisymmetric ones are dark and decouple to the photons .    in defining the coupling parameter @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mode cross area , then we can write @xmath102 the photon dispersion and the exciton - photon coupling is taken to be @xmath67 independent .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath103 where due to translational symmetry along the lattice and fiber axis , the hamiltonian is separated for each @xmath7 .    in the strong coupling regime , where the coupling is larger than both the exciton and photon line width , we define polaritons by diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xcite , to get the total hamiltonian by @xmath104 with the polariton dispersions @xmath105 where @xmath106 with the detuning @xmath107 the polariton operators are a coherent superposition of symmetric excitons and photons , where @xmath108 and where the amplitudes are given by @xmath109    here we present the results for a system with the following parameters : the lattice constant is @xmath110 , the transition energy is @xmath111 , the transition dipole is @xmath112 of angle @xmath113 with the lattice axis .",

    "( 4 ) we plot the transmission spectra for a wave number of @xmath135 , where we get two transmission peaks correspond to the two polariton branches which are separated by the rabi splitting .",
    "now we take an incident field of a wide bandwidth of @xmath136 . in figure",
    "( 5 ) we plot the transmission spectra for a wave number of @xmath135 , where here the band gab between the two peaks becomes a dip in the transmission spectrum .",

    "it is clear that for large wave numbers at the lower branch we get small transmission , where for large @xmath7 the excitons and photons with the same wave number have large detuning , namely they are off resonance . at the upper branch",
    "we get large transmission . as we mentioned previously",
    ", the upper branch becomes photonic and the lower one excitonic .",
    "we studied a recently demonstrated integrated hybrid atom - photon quantum system based on a tapered nanofiber and cold atoms .",
    "the nanofiber is used to implement two arrays of nanotraps for the atoms using off - resonant photons as well as to spatially confine resonant photons efficient to ensure strong single photon coupling to the two atomic ensembles .",
    "interestingly the effective coupling parameter of excitons in the two chains decays exponentially with their distance but it is still sufficient to split the energies of symmetric and antisymmetric excitons .",
    "only the symmetric excitons are bright and coherently mix with the nanofiber photons to form fiber polaritons , which can be seen in the transmission spectrum of the nanofiber .",
    "the present system allow one to investigate and to deeply understand one dimensional collective electronic excitations ( excitons ) , where it is possible to excite , store , and readout information in the form of coherent electronic excitations . as was shown in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "the damping rate of small wave number excitons in one dimensional lattice is much larger than a single atom excitation , and decay fast into free space .",
    "but beyond a critical wave number it is shown that one dimensional excitons became metastable with infinite radiative life time . in this regime , excitons can not be excited by free space photons , but can be easily excited by coupling to fiber photons .",
    "these excitons can serve for information storage devices and for communications through energy transfer . in the present paper the discussion",
    "is limited for the linear regime .",
    "nonlinear processes induced by electronic excitation saturation effects give rise for more interesting physics , which is our next task . at this point",
    "we have neglected the interaction of the atoms via light forces induced by multiple scattering of photons @xcite , which can be significantly enhanced through the transverse mode confinement and the fact that the atoms form bragg like structures .",
    "this could lead to collective oscillations and instabilities of the lattices but also can be used to engineer long distance motional couplings between ensembles .",
    "the work was supported by the austrian science funds ( fwf ) via the project ( p21101 ) , and the eranet nanosci - e+ project noi ( i269-n16 ) .",
    "in this appendix we calculate the exciton dynamical matrix for the two cases of intralattice interactions , @xmath39 , and interactions among interlattices , @xmath40 .      for interactions inside the same lattice , from equation ( [ rdd ] )",
