    "one should also stress that in the strongly correlated regime , both in bosonic and fermionic systems the standard descriptions of single - band hubbard model ceases to be valid .",
    "the effect of non - standard terms become important leading to novel phases like pair - superfluidity etc @xcite .    while most of the works have dealing with higher bands concentrated on bosonic systems , in this paper , we study dipolar fermions confined in 2d optical lattice @xmath2 + \\frac{m\\omega^2}{2}z^2 $ ] , where @xmath3 is the lattice depth , @xmath4 is the lattice constant , @xmath5 is the mass of the molecule , and @xmath6 is the frequency of harmonic potential in @xmath7 direction .",
