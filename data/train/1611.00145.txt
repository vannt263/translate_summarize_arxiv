    "the past decade has witnessed the appearance of a huge amount of experimental and theoretical work on the physical properties of various semimetals , in which the valence and conduction bands touch at isolated points @xcite .",
    "the low - energy elementary excitations in these semimetals are various types of massless fermions .",
    "the fermion density of state ( dos ) vanishes at band - touching points , so the coulomb interaction remains long - ranged .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the ordinary metals featuring a finite fermi surface , where coulomb interaction becomes short - range due to static screening .",
    "graphene is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac semimetal with massless dirac fermions being its low - energy excitations @xcite .",
    "the surface state of three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulator ( ti ) is also a 2d dirac semimetal @xcite .",
    "apart from these two examples , there are also a number of other systems that support low - energy bulk massless dirac or weyl fermions .",
    "for instance , a 3d dirac semimetal emerges at the quantum critical point ( qcp ) between a trivial band insulator and a topological insulator @xcite .",
    "moreover , stable 3d dirac semimetal , protected by crystal symmetry , has been found to exist in na@xmath1bi @xcite and cd@xmath1as@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "3d weyl semimetal , which hosts fermions with linear dispersion around pairs of weyl points with opposite chirality , was observed in taas @xcite , nbas @xcite , tap @xcite , and nbp @xcite by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments .",
    "several other types of semimetals , including 3d quadratic semimetal @xcite , 3d anisotropic weyl semimetal @xcite , 3d double weyl semimetal @xcite , 3d nodal - line semimetal @xcite , and 2d semi - dirac semimetal @xcite , are also widely investigated .",
    "the effects of long - range coulomb interaction have been studied in various types of semimetals @xcite .",
    "the role of coulomb interaction depends crucially on the fermion dispersion and the dimension .",
    "extensive renormalization group ( rg ) analysis @xcite have revealed that coulomb interaction is marginally irrelevant in 2d dirac semimetal @xcite , 3d dirac / weyl semimetal @xcite , and also 3d double weyl semimetal @xcite .",
    "the fermi liquid ( fl ) theory is valid in these systems .",
    "however , the coulomb interaction can not be simply neglected since it leads to fermion velocity renormalization and logarithmic - like correction to some of the observable quantities @xcite .",
    "indeed , the predicted velocity renormalization has already been observed in ultra clean suspended graphene @xcite , quasi - freestanding graphene on silicon carbide ( sic ) @xcite , and graphene on boron nitride substrate @xcite .",
    "there is also experimental evidence for the renormalization of fermion dispersion in ti - like system of bi bilayer grown on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 @xcite , which seems to be caused by coulomb interaction . in a 3d semimetal with quadratic dispersion",
    ", the coulomb interaction is found to be relevant and cause non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behaviors @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that recent arpes experiments have discovered nfl behavior in a 3d quadratic semimetal material pr@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a 3d anisotropic weyl semimetal @xcite and a 3d nodal - line semimetal @xcite , the fl description is robust because the coulomb interaction is irrelevant .    in an interacting 2d dirac fermion system ,",
    "an intriguing property is that the strong coulomb interaction might bind a gapless fermion and a gapless hole to form an excitonic pair , which generates a finite energy gap at the dirac points and turns the dirac semimetal into an excitonic insulator @xcite .",
    "this picture is very similar to the non - perturbative phenomenon of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) that has been extensively investigated in high energy physics @xcite since the pioneering work of nambu and jona - lasino @xcite . in qcd ,",
    "the current quarks are massless , but acquire a dynamical mass due to the strong interaction mediated by gluons .",
    "the dynamical quark mass breaks the chiral symmetry that is preserved by massless quarks . in a 2d dirac semimetal ,",
    "the dynamical fermion mass gap breaks the sublattice symmetry respected by massless dirac fermions .    according to theoretical analysis @xcite ,",
    "an excitonic gap can be dynamically generated in zero external magnetic field only when the effective strength of coulomb interaction , denoted by the parameter @xmath3 , is larger than certain critical value .",
    "the critical value @xmath4 defines a qcp that separates the semimetallic and excitonic insulating phases .",
    "this issue has been most extensively studied in the context of undoped graphene @xcite .",
    "physically , the excitonic insulating transition corresponds to the formation of a charge density wave ( cdw ) order @xcite .",
    "if the ground state of suspended graphene is an excitonic insulator , there would be more practical applications of graphene in the design of electronic devies @xcite . from a theoretic point of view",
    ", this provides an ideal laboratory to test some important concepts of high energy physics @xcite , and also gives us a nice platform to study the rich quantum critical phenomena .    in graphene and other dirac semimetals , the effective strength of coulomb interaction can be quantified by the ratio between the coulombic potential energy and kinetic energy of fermions , defined as @xcite @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the electric charge , @xmath7 fermion velocity , and @xmath8 dielectric constant .",
    "experiments have determined that the fermion velocity is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the speed of light in vacuum @xcite .",
    "for graphene on sio@xmath0 substrate , @xmath11 .",
    "when graphene is suspended in vacuum , @xmath3 takes its largest value @xmath12 @xcite , which implies that excitonic pairing is most possibly realized in suspended graphene . to specify whether suspended graphene has a semimetallic or insulating ground state",
    ", one needs to calculate the critical value @xmath4 and then compares it with @xmath12 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 has been evaluated by means of several different methods , including dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equation @xcite , bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xcite , rg approach @xcite , and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "drut and lhde claimed that @xmath13 in a 2d dirac fermion system @xcite , which indicates that graphene placed on sio@xmath0 substrate is semimetallic but suspended graphene is insulating at zero temperature .",
    "studies based on ds equation @xcite , bs equation @xcite , and rg analysis @xcite all showed that @xmath14 and hence also predicted an insulating ground state of suspended graphene .",
    "however , experiments clearly revealed that suspended graphene remains a semimetal down to very low temperature , without any sign of insulating behavior @xcite , which is apparently inconsistent with earlier theoretical results . a number of improved studies @xcite have been accomplished to reconcile this discrepancy . after taking into account the influence of fermion velocity renormalization and fermion damping ,",
    "it was showed in a refined ds equation analysis @xcite that the critical value is @xmath15 , which is much larger than @xmath16 .",
    "thus it turns out that the coulomb interaction in suspended graphene is still too weak to open an excitonic gap .",
    "subsequent ds equation computations @xcite reached the same qualitative conclusion . by considering the screening of coulomb interaction due to @xmath17-band electrons @xcite",
    ", recent monte carlo simulations also found that @xmath18 is greater than @xmath19 @xcite , which suggests a semimetallic ground state of suspended graphene .",
    "since graphene can not be an excitonic insulator , we turn to consider other types of semimetal where the coulomb interaction plays a more important role . among the existing semimetal materials",
    ", we find that 2d semi - dirac semimetal provides a better candidate for the realization of excitonic insulating transition than graphene .",
    "the dispersion for 2d semi - dirac fermion is @xmath20 which is linear along one momentum component ( @xmath21 ) but quadratic along the other one ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "such fermions can emerge at the qcp between a 2d dirac semimetal and a band insulator upon merging two separate dirac points into a single one .",
    "generation of semi - dirac fermions through merging of pairs of dirac point is theoretically predicted to exist in deformed graphene @xcite , pressured organic compound @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath0i@xmath1 @xcite , few - layer black phosphorus subject to pressure or perpendicular electric field @xcite or doping @xcite , and some artificial optical lattices @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the merging of distinct dirac points and the appearance of semi - dirac fermions were recently observed in ultracold fermi gas of @xmath23k atoms in honeycomb lattice @xcite , and microwave cavities with graphene - like structure @xcite .",
    "@xcite realized semi - dirac semimetals in few - layer black phosphorus at critical surface doping with potassium .",
    "robust semi - dirac semimetal state was also predicted to appear in tio@xmath0/vo@xmath0 nanostructure under suitable conditions @xcite .",
    "it was suggested by first - principle calculations that semi - dirac fermions may emerge in strained puckered arsenene @xcite .",
    "the influence of long - range coulomb interaction in 2d semi - dirac fermion system was recently investigated by pertubative rg method to one - loop order @xcite , which showed that coulomb interaction becomes anisotropic due to dynamical screening @xcite .",
    "when the bare value of interaction strength @xmath3 is in the strong coupling regime , the coulomb interaction induces an anomalous dimension for fermions and produces nfl behaviors over a wide range of intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "this property is qualitatively similar to graphene @xcite .",
    "regardless of the concrete value of @xmath3 , the kinetic energy of fermions is enhanced as the renormalized @xmath24 and @xmath7 increase with lowering energy .",
    "this drives @xmath3 to flow to zero in the low - energy region very slowly , which means the coulomb interaction in 2d semi - dirac semimetal is marginally irrelevant .",
    "however , 2d semi - dirac semimetal differs from graphene in one important aspect . in graphene , the quasiparticle residue @xmath25 flows to a finite value and thus the system is actually a normal fl despite of the existence of strong velocity renormalization @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in a 2d semi - dirac semimetal , @xmath25 flows to zero in the low - energy regime quite slowly , and the system is a marginal fermi liquid in the lowest energy limit @xcite .",
    "this difference indicates that the coulomb interaction plays a more important role in 2d semi - dirac semimetal than graphene",
    ". it might be possible to form excitonic insulator in some realistic 2d semi - dirac semimetal .",
    "dynamical excitonic gap generation is a genuine non - perturbative phenomenon , and can not be obtained within the framework of ordinary leading - order perturbative calculation @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the possibility of dynamical gap generation in a 2d semi - dirac semimetal by solving the self - consistent ds integral equation of the excitonic gap .",
    "the ds equation is formally very complicated , so it is usually necessary to make some approximations . after solving the ds equation by employing three frequently used approximations , we show that a moderately strong coulomb interaction suffices to generate an excitonic gap , and that it is easier to realize an excitonic insulating state in a 2d semi - dirac semimetal than in a 2d dirac semimetal . among the currently known semi - dirac semimetals",
    ", we find that the tio@xmath0/vo@xmath0 nanostructure is a particularly promising candidate to realize excitonic insulating state .",
    "one reason is that the such nanostructure is an intrinsic semi - dirac fermion system , without necessity of fine tuning .",
    "the other reason is that the physical value of @xmath3 in this nanostructure is either smaller or very close to the critical value @xmath4 obtained in our ds equation calculations .",
    "apart from the long - range coulomb interaction , there may be some additional short - range four - fermion couplings in real materials . adding such coupling to the system reduces the critical value @xmath4 , and hence catalyzes dynamical excitonic gap generation .    in the insulating phase ,",
    "the fermions are massive and the systems exhibits different properties than the semimetal phase . we calculate dos and specific heat of the insulating phase , and compare them with those of semimetal phase . moreover ,",
    "we perform a systematic rg analysis of the yukawa - type coupling between massless fermions and the quantum fluctuation of excitonic order parameter at the qcp of semimetal - insulator transition , and find nfl behaviors of massless fermions .",
    "we also study the interplay of this yukawa coupling with long - range coulomb interaction . in this case",
    ", the massless fermions still exhibit nfl behaviors , but some model parameters behave quite differently from those obtained in the case without coulomb interaction .    the rest of the paper will be organized as follows .",
