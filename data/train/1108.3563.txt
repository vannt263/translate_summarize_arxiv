    "a merit of the latter is that low - energy dynamics of vortices can be described by geodesics on the moduli space , see @xcite as a review .",
    "since the discovery of non - abelian vortices @xcite , various aspects of vortices have been investigated from both of string theory and gauge field theory perspectives .",
    "one peculiar property is that a non - abelian vortex in @xmath4 gauge theory admits a @xmath5 moduli space which corresponds to nambu - goldstone modes in the internal space as for yang - mills instantons .",
    "non - abelian vortices provide a connection between bps spectra of four - dimensional @xmath6 supersymmetric gauge theories and two dimensional @xmath7 @xmath5 model @xcite .",
    "while t hooft - polyakov monopoles become kinks inside a non - abelian vortex @xcite , yang - mills instantons become sigma model instantons there @xcite . as for the moduli space perspective , by applying a useful treatment of bps equations to the non - abelian vortex @xcite , several properties on the moduli space and low - energy dynamics have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "recently further developments , for example , vortex counting @xcite , volume of the moduli space @xcite and so on , have been performed by applying the localization formula as well as the four dimensional gauge theory .",
    "they play an important role in determining the low energy behavior of the supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "other than the flat space @xmath8 , studies of non - abelian vortices have been so far restricted to those on regular spaces , such as a cylinder @xcite , a torus @xcite , riemann surfaces @xcite , and hyperbolic surfaces @xcite .",

    "in this paper we consider abelian and non - abelian vortices on two dimensional singular spaces , namely the orbifolds @xmath9 .",
    "although the four dimensional gauge theory on the singular space , or the smooth space given by resolving its singularity , which is called the asymptotically locally euclidean ( ale ) space , has been investigated in detail , various studies on the vortex theory are mainly based on the regular space as denoted above .",
    "indeed , in the case of the four dimensional theory , the ale space has a hyper - khler metric @xcite , so that almost the same procedure to construct instantons on such a space as the usual euclidean space @xmath10 , or the four sphere @xmath11 , can be performed @xcite .",
    "furthermore the instanton counting and its matrix model description have been discussed for the ale space @xcite . the recent development on the four dimensional theory , which is called the agt relation @xcite ,",
    "is also studied for this case @xcite .",
    "therefore it is natural to expect that study of vortices on orbifolds would give a novel perspective to the vortex theory .    to deal with the orbifold theory",
    "we first apply the moduli matrix approach @xcite rather than hanany - tong s method .",
    "it is because , for the former one , we can easily see the space - time structure of the vortex configuration and the dynamics of vortices @xcite while it is slightly difficult to see it for the latter one , which is based on the dual configuration .",
    "we first consider the fields on the usual regular space @xmath12 , namely the universal cover of the orbifold , and then take the orbifold projection to obtain the @xmath13 invariant sector of the configuration . because of the singular property of the space , we have to assign the boundary condition , which breaks the original gauge symmetry .",
    "this symmetry breaking affects the symmetry of the moduli space , and leads to its decomposition .",
    "we find that @xmath14-vortices on @xmath9 with @xmath15 are fixed at the orbifold singularity , as yang - mills instantons @xcite and fractional d - branes @xcite on the orbifolds or their resolution to ale spaces .",

    "we show that mirror images have the same internal moduli @xmath5 for @xmath4 gauge theory .",
    "we also find that ano vortices at the singularity do not give any moduli , while fractional non - abelian vortices at the singularity give internal moduli .",
    "we then discuss the vortex collision for the orbifold theory .",
    "since elements of the moduli matrix are directly related to smooth coordinates of the moduli space , we can follow vortex dynamics along geodesics on the moduli space .",
    "especially when we concentrate on a short time behavior at collision moment , the geodesics can be approximated by straight lines in smooth coordinates and therefore we do not need the actual metric @xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the collision at the origin of the complex plane , which corresponds to the singular point of the orbifold , because other points are essentially the same as the usual regular space . due to the singularity of the orbifold",

    "we can perform a quite similar procedure as the instantons on the ale space , and then obtain _ a half of adhm on the ale spaces of the @xmath18 type _ as discussed in the regular case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : orb ] we first discuss how to deal with the orbifold theory through the boundary condition .",

    "since the energy of this configuration is given by @xmath55 where the integral is performed only on the fundamental region , the moduli matrix for @xmath14-vortex solution is written as @xmath56 here @xmath14 is the number of vortices on the whole complex plane @xmath17 and @xmath57 parametrizes the position of the vortex .",
    "we remark the winding number @xmath58 is different from the vortex number @xmath14",

    "for @xmath59 , applying the boundary condition ( [ bc03 ] ) , this function has to satisfy @xmath62 this condition is satisfied only if @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this means that the vortex is fixed at the singular point of @xmath9 , and the boundary condition is automatically determined as @xmath65 .",
    "we can easily generalize this result for @xmath66 . the boundary condition ( [ bc02 ] )",
    "reduces the moduli matrix ( [ moduli_abelian ] ) to a trivial form @xmath67 satisfying @xmath68 . as the case of @xmath59 , positions of vortices are fixed at the origin , and thus the position moduli does not exist for @xmath66 .",
    "this means the fractional vortices are fixed at the origin .",
    "we then study the case of @xmath69 . in this case the moduli matrix ( [ moduli_abelian ] ) is reduced to @xmath70 which satisfies @xmath71 .",
    "this configuration has only one position modulus @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_orbifold ] ) .",
    "finally we provide the moduli matrix for generic vortex number @xmath73  ( mod  @xmath16 ) , @xmath74 we can see that this solution satisfies the boundary condition @xmath75 . since there is only position , but internal moduli , the moduli space for abelian vortices on the orbifold is given by @xmath76 } /    \\mathfrak{s}_{\\left[k / n\\right]}.\\ ] ] here @xmath77 $ ] denotes the largest integer not greater than @xmath78 .",

    "the same property can be found in yang - mills instantons @xcite and fractional d - branes @xcite on orbifolds .",
    "we now consider the simplest non - abelian gauge group @xmath79 and the orbifold @xmath80 for convenience .",
    "the moduli matrix for @xmath59 vortex in @xmath79 gauge theory on @xmath17 is given by @xcite @xmath81 the corresponding orbifold transformation matrix can be simply determined by reading the diagonal components of the moduli matrix as @xmath82 on the other hand , the moduli matrices ( [ moduli_mat01 ] ) themselves do not satisfy the boundary condition in a consistent way because we have different expressions as follows , @xmath83 by equating them , @xmath84 , we have to assign @xmath64 to satisfy the boundary condition consistently .",
    "we obtain the same condition from the other one @xmath85 .",
    "thus under this orbifold projection the moduli matrix for @xmath80 theory becomes @xmath86 we remark since @xmath87 and @xmath88 are related as @xmath89 via the @xmath52-transformation , which is regarded as the complexified gauge transformation @xcite , there is only one parameter @xmath87 interpreted as the internal moduli .",
    "therefore @xmath59 fractional vortex is fixed at the singular point , and still has the internal degree of freedom , which turns out to be a coordinate of @xmath90 , as the usual non - abelian vortex .",
    "indeed we can extract the orientation of the vortex via the following equations @xcite , @xmath91 thus we have the orientational vectors @xmath92 these are nothing but two patches of @xmath90 .",
    "thus the moduli space for @xmath59 vortex solution in @xmath79 gauge theory on the orbifold @xmath80 is given by @xmath93 here we introduce a useful notation to characterize the moduli matrix by using the young diagram as discussed in @xcite : @xmath32 entries of the partition correspond to the powers of the diagonal components of the moduli matrix for @xmath4 gauge theory .",
    "we can always obtain a descending ordered matrix by the @xmath52-transformation .",

    "are given by @xmath95 the corresponding orbifold transformation matrices are given by @xmath96 performing the orbifold projection in a similar manner , the moduli matrices are reduced to @xmath97    we now comment on two remarkable facts .",
    "first by imposing @xmath98 in order for these two of the moduli matrices , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , to describe the vortices in the same positions as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deth_0 ] ) , they are almost the same as those for @xmath59 on @xmath17 shown in eq .",
    "( [ moduli_mat01 ] ) .",
    "the difference is its argument , @xmath101 .",
    "this means that two vortices located at @xmath102 and @xmath103 have the same internal moduli @xmath90 , and thus they turn out to be identical .",
    "the vortex orientation can be obtained in a similar way as the case @xmath59 ; from the equations @xmath104 we obtain the orientational vectors @xmath105 they are nothing but coordinates of @xmath90 .",
    "second is that we can not perform a @xmath52-transformation which connects @xmath106 with @xmath99 or @xmath100 , while @xmath99 and @xmath100 are connected via @xmath52-transformation .",
    "this is obvious from the fact that we can not impose @xmath107 except for @xmath108 .",
    "therefore the part , corresponding to @xmath106 , is disconnected to the continuous one connecting @xmath99 and @xmath100 in the moduli space @xmath109 . in general , we can see if the orbifold transformation matrices are different , the corresponding parts are disconnected .",
    "actually in this case we have @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore the moduli matrix @xmath106 has neither of position nor internal moduli , so that it corresponds to just an isolated point in the moduli space .",
    "the absence of internal moduli also means that it can be regarded as an abelian ( ano ) vortex .",
    "actually we can not extract the vortex orientation for this case because @xmath111 . thus implying @xmath112 transformation of a complex coordinate @xmath113",
    ", the moduli space for @xmath94 turns out to be @xmath114 where each sector is given by @xmath115      we then consider @xmath117 vortices configurations .",
    "the generic forms of the moduli matrices on @xmath17 are written as @xmath118 the orbifold transformation matrices , characterizing the boundary conditions , can be simply obtained from powers of the diagonal components of the moduli matrices , @xmath119",
    "we then apply the orbifold projection to the moduli matrices by removing components whose powers are different by modulo @xmath16 from that of the diagonal component in the same row .",
    "the moduli matrices for the orbifolding theory are obtained as @xmath120 as in the previous example we have to choose @xmath121 and @xmath122 to obtain the same determinant @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "we can see that @xmath125 and @xmath126 or @xmath127 and @xmath128 are connected via @xmath52-transformations .",
    "however we can not connect a different combination , for example , @xmath125 and @xmath127 , and they are disconnected as in the @xmath94 case .",
    "indeed the numbers of internal moduli are different : two for the former and one for the latter .",
    "furthermore , the orbifold transformation matrices for them are different by comparing in the _ descending _ order .",
    "although we have the same orbifold transformation matrices for @xmath125 and @xmath128 , we have to compare @xmath129 with @xmath130 because @xmath131 is not in the _ descending _ order .",
    "the vortex orientations are given by @xmath132 @xmath133    the two internal moduli for @xmath125 and @xmath126 are interpreted as coordinates of @xmath134 for the separated @xmath94 vortices as well as the usual @xmath94 configuration on @xmath17 studied in@xcite . when these @xmath94 vortices coincide , we have @xmath108 . in this case",
    "the remaining orientation is just a @xmath90 .",
    "this situation is essentially different from the the coincident @xmath94 vortices on @xmath17 where the moduli space is given by @xmath135 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "since there is the only one internal moduli for @xmath127 and @xmath128 , we have to discuss which vortex possesses it . then taking an asymptotic limit @xmath136 , we have @xmath137 @xmath138 this means that an internal moduli parameter @xmath139 , regarded as a coordinate of @xmath90 , belongs to a vortex at @xmath140 .",
    "indeed the vortex orientations at @xmath141 turn out to be @xmath142 0 when we take the limit @xmath143 , they behave as @xmath144 @xmath145    in summary , in this case the moduli space is given by @xmath146 here , for the first sector we have to write it as follows , @xmath147 where each part @xmath148 is glued to each other . since the first sector is defined only when @xmath149 , we denote the position moduli as @xmath150 .",
    "the second sector is simply given by @xmath151      let us consider the moduli matrix for the generic @xmath4 gauge theory .",
    "decomposing the total vortex number , @xmath152 with @xmath153 and @xmath154 , it is written as a lower triangle matrix , @xmath155 we can perform the orbifold projection as discussed in the previous section . writing each decomposed vortex number as @xmath156 ( mod @xmath16 ) ,",
    "the orbifold transformation matrix is given by @xmath157 in order for the moduli matrix to satisfy the boundary condition consistently , we have to remove factors whose powers are different by modulo @xmath16 from that of the diagonal component in the same row .",

    "indeed a similar situation for a fractional object is observed in other models ; yang - mills instantons @xcite and fractional d - branes @xcite on orbifolds or their resolution to ale spaces . in the non - abelian theory",
    "we have the internal moduli as well as the usual vortices on @xmath17 .",
    "however , while the whole moduli space is connected via the @xmath52-transformation before orbifolding , the moduli space for the orbifold theory can be decomposed to disconnected parts .",
    "this decomposition is due to the gauge symmetry breaking via the boundary condition .",
    "we have found that the decomposed sectors one to one correspond to the orbifold transfomation matrices @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : otm ] ) , which transform fields at @xmath21 and @xmath226 , in the _ descending _ order .",
    "although it is similar to the theory in presence of the twisted mass term @xcite , an essential difference exists between them ; each sector is completely decoupled from each other in the case of orbifolds while it is just separated by a potential in the case of twisted mass .",
    "accordingly , two vortex states can be connected along a string making a confined monopole in the case of the twisted masses while it is impossible for the orbifolds .",
    "we have also discussed vortex collision for the orbifold theory with the moduli matrix perspective .",
    "we have shown the scattering angle is directly reflecting the orbifold structure .",
    "furthermore we can observe an unusual behavior of the internal moduli for the non - abelian vortex .",
    "the internal orientations of two vortices coincide when they are colliding , but their behavior after the collision is different from the usual one on @xmath17 .",
    "finally the relation to hanany - tong s approach is discussed . as well as the instantons on the orbifold , or the ale space given by resolving its singularity",
    ", we have a similar quiver theory for the khler quotient .",
    "we have seen that it is just a half of adhm for instantons on the type-@xmath227 orbifold @xmath228 .    here before closing the paper ,",
    "we give several discussions .    in this paper",
    "we have studied short time dynamics around the collision moment for which we have not needed explicit metric on the moduli space , but we need it for studying a long time behavior .",
    "the moduli space metric has been explicitly obtained for non - abelian vortices on @xmath17 @xcite and on riemann surfaces @xcite when vortices are well separated , and dynamics and scattering have been studied on @xmath17 @xcite . beyond our work",
    "it will be an interesting and important future problem to construct an explicit metric of the moduli space in our case of the orbifold @xmath9 .",
    "one nontrivial effect will be the existence of the fractional vortices fixed at the orbifold singularity",
    ". it does not appear in the moduli space in some cases , but even in that case the existence of such a flux at the singularity will change the moduli space metric .",
    "for instance , ano vortices fixed at the singularity in both abelian and non - abelian gauge theories have no moduli but the fluxes do exist there .    in this paper we have concentrated on local vortices , namely vortices in @xmath4 gauge theory with @xmath229 fundamental scalar fields . when the number of flavor is greater than the number of color , @xmath230 , vortices are called semi - local @xcite .",
    "however we have to be careful on ( non-)normalizability of moduli parameters in this case @xcite .",
    "other extensions would be changing gauge symmetry from @xmath4 to @xmath231 such as @xmath232 @xcite .",
    "let us make a comment on a relation to yang - mills instantons .",
    "in five dimensional gauge theory in the higgs phase , instantons on @xmath233 can live stably in a vortex world - volume in which yang - mills instantons are regarded as lumps or sigma model instantons @xcite .",
    "it becomes amoeba in more general on @xmath234 @xcite . in our case of the orbifold theory ,",
    "instantons live on a vortex in @xmath235 where the vortex world - volume extends to @xmath17 . in the case of @xmath233",
    "we obtain usual instantons in the limit of vanishing fayet - iliopoulos parameter @xmath46 in which the model goes to unbroken phase",
    ". it will be interesting to study what happens in the same limit for instantons on @xmath235 . also this may be related to surface operators in the agt relation @xcite .",
    "finally we comment on physical applications of the vortices on orbifolds .",
    "the vortex polygon and crystal , discussed in a few body vortex system @xcite , have a similar property to the orbifold theory studied in this paper .",
    "we have to discuss relation between them in a future work .",
    "another proposal is application to the two dimensional carbon system .",
    "the conical structure , mimicking the orbifolds @xmath9 , could be obtained by manipulating the graphene sheet or the carbon nanotube .",
    "the authors would like to thank k.  hashimoto for valuable discussions .",
    "they are also grateful to t.  fujimori , t.  nishioka and y.  yoshida for useful comments .",

    "in this appendix we comment on the adhm construction for the ale spaces @xcite .",
    "first let us start with the adhm method without orbifolding .",
    "we now introduce the adhm data @xmath236 satisfying the following adhm equations given by @xmath237 + i j = 0 , \\\\   \\mu_{{\\mathbb{r } } } & : = & [ b_1 , b_1^\\dag ] + [ b_2 , b_2^\\dag ] + i i^\\dag + j^\\dag j = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",

    "we now discuss only the case of @xmath245 for simplicity .",
    "let @xmath246 be a coordinate of @xmath233 , thus the orbifold @xmath228 is obtained by identification @xmath247 with @xmath22 . to study how this identification affects the adhm equation",
    ", we then consider action of the isometry @xmath248 on the adhm data , @xmath249 .",
    "decomposing the vector spaces as well as the vortex theory ( [ decom_vec_sp ] ) due to the irreducible representation of @xmath13 , again these dimensions are dim  @xmath202 , dim  @xmath203",
    ". then we have @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "we can write down the adhm equation for the ale space in terms of these components , @xmath254 where @xmath255 and @xmath256 are related to blow - up parameters of orbifold singularities , satisfying @xmath257 when all @xmath258 , the ale space goes back to the singular orbifold .",
    "[ quiv_fig_inst ] shows the quiver diagram for the adhm data .",
    "note that it is directly related to dynkin diagram for the @xmath18 root system .",
