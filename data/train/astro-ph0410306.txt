    "the existence of inactive supermassive black holes in the nuclei of massive nearby galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) is a sure sign that most galaxies underwent substantial active phases .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between the amount of material accreted ( black hole mass ) and the galaxy mass indicates important links between galaxy formation and agn activity .",
    "one implication is that the most massive black holes live in the most massive galaxies which reside in the most massive dark matter halos .",
    "the @xmath0 quasars being discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( see fan , this volume ) have exceptionally high luminosities ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the available evidence suggests that these luminosities are not amplified by gravitational lensing ( fan et al .",
    "2003 ) or beaming ( pentericci et al . 2002",
    "; willott et al .",
    "2003 ) . assuming that these quasars are radiating at the eddington limit",
    "gives a lower limit on their black hole masses of several billion solar masses .",
    "these are comparable to the black holes inside the largest dominant cluster ellipticals at the present time . applying local calibrations from this black hole mass to galaxy and",
    "halo masses suggests that these quasars reside in halos with mass @xmath2 ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "lcdm simulations show that structure grows ` bottom - up ' with the largest halos typically collapsing at the latest epochs .",
    "halos with mass @xmath3 at @xmath4 are therefore extremely rare ( the fraction of mass in such halos is of order @xmath5 ; sheth & tormen 1999 )    there is evidence that at least some of these quasars are located in massive galaxies .",
    "sub - millimetre photometry of several of them show very high far - infrared luminosities , implying extreme starbursts of @xmath6 ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 ; priddey et al .",
    "the most distant quasar , sdssj1148 + 5251 at @xmath7 , contains @xmath8 of molecular gas , again indicative of a massive , primeval galaxy ( walter et al .",
    "these distant quasars , which are thought to be residing in massive galaxies , are therefore ideal places to search for the first clusters of galaxies .",
    "the most straightforward method for identifying galaxies at such high redshifts is the lyman - break technique  a large discontinuity in the spectral slope due to absorption by neutral hydrogen ( e.g. steidel et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the increase in the optical depth of hydrogen absorption at such high redshifts ( e.g. songaila & cowie 2002 ) makes the lyman - break technique even more effective at @xmath9 than at lower redshifts . to search for galaxies in these putative mass overdensities",
    ", we carried out a search for lyman - break galaxies in fields of three @xmath10 sdss quasars .",
    "we have imaged three quasar fields with the gmos - north imaging spectrograph on the gemini - north telescope : sdssj1030 + 0524 at @xmath11 , sdssj1048 + 4637 at @xmath12 and sdssj1148 + 5251 at @xmath7 .",
    "the imaging field - of - view is 5.5 arcmin on a side , equivalent to a co - moving size of 13 mpc at @xmath13 .",
    "observations were carried out in queue mode during november and december 2003 .",
    "the typical seeing fwhm of the observations is in the range 0.5 to @xmath14 .",
    "typical exposure times are @xmath15 hours in the @xmath16-band and @xmath17 hours in the @xmath18-band . the relative exposure times were designed to give similar sensitivity in the two bands for very red objects with colours of @xmath19 .",
    "full details of these observations and their reduction will be published elsewhere .",
    "-band magnitude derived from recovery of simulated galaxies .",
    "the curves are quite similar for the three different quasar fields .",
    "dotted lines indicate the location of a completeness ratio of 0.8 and the adopted complete magnitude limit of @xmath20 . ]",
    "detection of objects in the reduced images was performed using the sextractor software ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath16-band was selected as the primary detection waveband since @xmath0 galaxies are expected to have @xmath21 and may therefore be undetected at @xmath18 .",
    "sextractor was run in `` double - image '' mode to determine @xmath18-band measurements for objects detected in @xmath16 .",
    "magnitudes on the ab system were measured in circular apertures of diameter @xmath22 .",
    "aperture corrections were applied statistically to the @xmath16-band magnitudes by fitting a linear function to the difference between the total magnitude and aperture magnitude as a function of aperture magnitude .",
    "typical magnitude limits ( @xmath23 limits in @xmath24 apertures ) are @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    to assess the completeness of the @xmath16-band catalogues we consider both the observed number counts and the recovery of simulated objects .",
    "the number counts in the three fields do not differ significantly from each other .",
    "they agree well with the @xmath16-band counts determined from a much larger area survey ( 0.2 square degrees or thirty times the gmos - north field - of - view ) by capak et al .",
    "the number counts in the quasar fields begin to change slope at @xmath27 and turn over at @xmath28 , indicating this is where the sample becomes incomplete .",
    "the source recovery as a function of magnitude was determined by populating the images with artificial galaxies and then using sextractor to attempt to detect these objects .",
    "about 10000 artificial galaxies with magnitudes in the range @xmath29 were placed into copies of the @xmath16 images of each quasar .",
    "regions of the images already occupied by objects were masked out of the process to eliminate incompleteness due to blending .",
    "the resulting completeness ratio is plotted as a function of magnitude for the three quasar fields in fig.[fig : comp ] .",
    "the completeness in all the fields is fairly flat at close to 1 up to @xmath30 and then begins to decline .",
    "the rapid decline occurs at @xmath27 and the completeness drops to 0.5 by @xmath31 .",
    "all the fields have completeness @xmath32 at @xmath20 and we adopt this as the magnitude at which completeness begins to become an issue .",
    "this analysis with simulated objects agrees well with the results for the number counts discussed previously .",
    "the @xmath0 sdss quasars have @xmath33 and colours of @xmath34 respectively for j1030 , j1048 and j1148 .",
    "quasars and star - forming galaxies have broadly similar spectra over the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath35 nm probed by the @xmath18 and @xmath16 filters .",
    "their spectra are dominated by a large break due to absorption by neutral hydrogen .",
    "therefore one would expect companion galaxies to have comparable colours to the quasars .    a colour - magnitude diagram for objects in the field of sdssj1030 + 0524",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : colmags ] .",
    "most objects have colours in the range @xmath36 as is well known from previous surveys ( dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ; capak et al .",
    "2004 ) . also plotted are curves showing the colour - magnitude relation for two different types of galaxy .",
    "model galaxy spectra were generated from the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) spectral synthesis code with lyman forest absorption evolution matching the observations of songaila & cowie ( 2002 ) .",
    "the upper curve is a present - day l@xmath37 elliptical which formed all of its stars in a starburst starting at @xmath38 with a characteristic timescale of 1gyr and evolved since without merging .",
    "note that there is no dust extinction assumed for this model , but in reality the dust extinction would increase with redshift ( due to evolution and @xmath39-correction ) making the galaxy fainter than plotted at higher redshifts .",
    "the lower curve is a l@xmath37 lyman - break galaxy model where the galaxy is observed 0.5gyr into a constant star formation rate starburst .",
    "a search was made for objects which could plausibly be high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the @xmath18-band dropout selection criteria adopted were snr in the @xmath16-band @xmath40 and a colour of @xmath41 .",
    "possible candidates were inspected and magnitudes checked to ensure their unusual colours are not spurious .",
    "a total of four objects satisfying these criteria were found ; two in the field of sdssj1030 + 0524 , shown in fig.[fig : colmags ] with filled symbols , and one in each of the other two fields . only one of these four galaxies has a magnitude brighter than the completeness limit of @xmath20 .",
    "this object has @xmath42 which is quite close to the colour selection value and the size of the uncertainty means it is quite plausible that photometric errors have scattered the colour into the dropout range .",
    "the measured colour is about @xmath43 away from the colours of the sdss quasars , which suggests that if it is a high - redshift galaxy , then it is most likely foreground to the quasars with a redshift in the range @xmath44 .",
    "the other three objects have @xmath45 and only lower limits on their @xmath46 colours which lie in the range @xmath47 .",
    "-band in the field of the @xmath11 quasar sdssj1030 + 0524 .",
    "the completeness limit of @xmath20 is shown with a dot - dashed line .",
    "the high - redshift galaxy selection criterion of @xmath48 is marked with the dashed line .",
    "the dotted line represents the colour of an object which is just detected at the @xmath23 level in the @xmath18-band as a function of the @xmath16-band magnitude .",
    "most objects with measured zero or negative flux in the @xmath18-band are plotted at @xmath49 .",
    "the exceptions to this are objects which pass the @xmath18-band dropout selection criteria discussed in the text .",
    "these are shown with star symbols and lower limits on the @xmath18-band @xmath23 line .",
    "the dots at @xmath48 indicate sources which are detected at less than @xmath50 at @xmath16-band and hence have very large uncertainties on their magnitudes and colours and in some cases may be spurious .",
    "the labelled curves show the colour and magnitude as a function of redshift for an evolving l@xmath37 elliptical ( upper curve ) and a non - evolving l@xmath37 lyman - break galaxy ( lower curve )  see text for more details . ]",
    "our @xmath16-band images are complete at the greater than 80% level to @xmath20 . at @xmath51 , every single @xmath16-band object detected on our images",
    "has a counterpart at the @xmath52 level in the @xmath18-band image . at fainter magnitudes ,",
    "this is no longer true and our constraints on the @xmath46 colours of objects at these magnitudes becomes very weak due to uncertainty in both the @xmath16 and @xmath18 magnitudes .",
    "we now consider the number of @xmath18-band dropouts we could have expected to find under the assumption that the quasar fields are `` random '' and show no enhancement due to the existence of the quasars .",
    "the best comparison dataset which goes deep enough over a wide area is the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "acs imaging of the goods regions ( giavalisco et al .",
    "these observations give a surface density of objects with @xmath53 and @xmath48 of 0.02 arcmin@xmath54 ( dickinson et al 2004 ; bouwens et al .",
    "the total sky area we have surveyed with gmos - north is 82 arcmin@xmath55 . therefore on the basis of the goods observations we would expect 1.6 @xmath18-band dropouts in our total area .",
    "our finding of one dropout is entirely consistent with the expectations for blank fields .",
    "our observations show that these quasar fields do not exhibit an excess of luminous companion galaxies .",
    "the magnitude limit of @xmath20 corresponds to a uv luminosity of @xmath56 at a redshift of @xmath13 .",
    "this is equivalent to an unobscured star formation rate of @xmath57 , assuming the conversion given in madau , pozzetti & dickinson ( 1998 ) .",
    "the few known galaxies at redshifts @xmath58 discovered in narrow - band surveys have star formation rates derived from their uv luminosities comparable to this limit ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ; kodaira et al .",
    "for comparison , the millimeter detections of dust in j1048 and j1148 imply total star formation rates @xmath59 in the host galaxies of the quasars ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "how do we explain the lack of companion galaxies with high star formation rates ?",
    "one possibility is that galaxies undergoing intense star formation do exist but they are heavily extinguished by dust .",
    "such galaxies may be detectable via their far - infrared emission and we are conducting a program of sub - mm imaging around these quasars to identify such galaxies .",
    "deep observations with the irac camera on the _ spitzer space telescope _ would also be able to reveal these obscured galaxies .",
    "another possibility is that massive companion galaxies exist but they are not observed during a period of intense star formation .",
    "this possibility seems unlikely since the youth of the universe at this redshift means galaxies would likely be gas - rich and forming stars , especially if located in a dense environment which is not yet virialized .",
    "finally , we raise a question mark over the notion that these rare massive black holes actually reside in the rarest , densest peaks in the dark matter distribution .",
    "perhaps the correlation between black hole mass and dark matter halo mass ( or halo circular velocity  see wyithe & loeb 2004 ) does not apply to these quasars and they are actually located inside less massive dark matter halos .",
