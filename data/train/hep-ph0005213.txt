    "radiative pion capture by a nucleon is one of the obvious reactions to use as a testbed for heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) . for charged pions ,",
    "the reaction begins at @xmath3 , which is leading order in hbchpt , and it is known that the @xmath2 result for s - wave multipole is in reasonable agreement with most measurements @xcite .",
    "the p - wave multipoles however seem never to have been calculated .",
    "this is in contrast to the neutral pion case where both s- and p - wave multipoles have been extensively discussed @xcite .",
    "a calculation beyond the s - wave provides insight into the convergence of the chiral expansion and also serves to determine some of the hbchpt parameters that are required for other reactions , such as radiative muon capture by a nucleon , where the existing experimental data are in surprising disagreement with theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "thus an investigation of the p - wave multipoles in the charged case is a useful thing to do and is the primary aim of this work .    in the present work ,",
    "the only explicit fields in the chiral lagrangian are the pions and nucleons .",
    "other physical particles will enter the calculation through their implicit contributions to the lagrangian s parameters ( lec s ) .",
    "for some reactions it is advantageous to include the @xmath5 explicitly , as done for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is possible that this could be a useful approach for radiative pion capture as well , once one goes away from threshold",
    ". however , it is consistent to absorb such resonances in the lec s and we shall see that for the present reaction a reasonable fit to the data can be obtained when the @xmath5 is left implicit in the hbchpt parameters .",
    "experimental data for the @xmath0 differential cross section was reported fifteen years ago from a triumf experiment at beam energies of @xmath6 and 39.3 mev @xcite .",
    "a recent triumf experiment has taken data at @xmath7 , 14.62 and 19.85 mev @xcite .",

    ".    there are at least two modern theoretical discussions of radiative charged - pion capture ( both discussions actually address the inverse reaction : charged - pion photoproduction ) .",

    ", one observes a recoiling nucleon and a low energy photon with polarization four - vector @xmath14 and four - momentum @xmath15 . the pion s center - of - mass energy",
    "is related to @xmath16 , the square of the total energy in the center of mass , and to @xmath17 , the kinetic energy in the lab frame by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath13 are respectively the pion and nucleon masses .",
    "the analogous formulas for the photon energy in the center of mass are @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the corresponding laboratory gamma energy for the inverse process .",
    "all energy dependence will be expressed via the pion energy in the center - of - mass system .",
    "for the energy of the final state photon we therefore employ @xmath22    the differential cross section for the pion capture process in the center - of - mass frame is , @xmath23 and that for the inverse ( photoproduction ) reaction is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the amplitude defined below . notice that eqs .",
    "( [ diffxsecpi ] ) and ( [ diffxsecga ] ) explicitly contain the average over initial and sum over final spins and polarizations and that the two cross sections are related by the usual detailed balance relation .",
    "essentially all previous work has dealt with the inverse , photoproduction , process , @xmath26 and the conventions for that process are by now well established .",
    "thus in the coulomb gauge with @xmath27 and the transversality condition @xmath28 the amplitude for that process can be written in terms of the t - matrix as @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a pauli matrix in spin space between the two - component spinors of the incoming / outgoing nucleon ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 is the photon polarization vector and @xmath33 corresponds to the cosine of the angle between the photon and the pion momenta .",

    "it is reassuring to see that within the uncertainties all of the various data sets lead to the same numerical values for these parameters , though the fit becomes more stable and the uncertainties smaller as we increase the number of data points included in the fit .",
    "it should also be noted that each of our least - squares fits actually finds two sets of parameters , characterized by nearly identical values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 but quite different values of @xmath62 , depending on where the least - squares routine begins in parameter space .",

    "very preliminary estimates seem to indicate that such effects are relatively small in the very near threshold region we are considering , but it might be worth doing a full calculation .    finally , as somewhat of a side issue , we note that an alternative representation of the near - threshold differential cross section which is often used is @xmath110 however , this near - threshold result differs somewhat from the general result we have used .",
    "it is obtained by expanding the original amplitude , e.g. the pion pole contributions , and keeping terms only through @xmath111 , which is sufficient to give the cross section in terms of s- and p - wave multipoles .",
    "in contrast we used the square of the full hbchpt amplitude to get the cross section , and only later after fitting the data extracted the s- and p - wave multipoles .",
    "we have investigated the radiative capture of a charged pion by a nucleon using heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory and have obtained explicit expressions for the amplitude and for the s- and p - wave multipoles , expressed , as is more conventional , as amplitudes for the inverse photoproduction process . up to @xmath2",
    ", these expressions depend upon three parameters that were determined by fitting to data for @xmath99 capture by a proton and for very near threshold photoproduction .",
    "two satisfactory fits were obtained , which were indistinguishable , based only on comparison with the data .    using the lec s obtained from these fits , the eight s- and",
    "p - wave multipoles ( four for the @xmath98 case and four for the @xmath99 case ) were calculated and compared with results previously obtained from dispersion theory @xcite . in general the agreement was good for one of the fits , a(35 ) , whereas there were significant differences when the other fit was used .",
    "this same result held for combinations of the multipoles depending on just a few of the parameters .",
    "we thus conclude that the a(35 ) fit gives an acceptable result , and thus that the three parameters determined in that fit , @xmath112 and given in table [ tab : bs ] are available for future studies of other reactions .    in general the convergence of",
    "the hbchpt expansion was very good for the electric multipoles , but somewhat less good for the magnetic ones .",
    "this suggests that it might be valuable to consider extending the present work to @xmath109 or to include explicit @xmath5 fields in the chiral lagrangian .",
