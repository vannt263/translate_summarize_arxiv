    "we mimic such situations in our laboratory experiment by adopting the traditional random pairwise - matching protocol @xcite : at each game round ( time ) @xmath15 the players are randomly paired within the population and compete with their pair opponent once ; after that each player gets feedback information about her own payoff as well as her and her opponent s action . as the whole experimental session finishes ,",
    "the players are paid in real cash proportional to their accumulated payoffs ( see _ materials and methods _ ) .",

    "we observe that the individual players shift their actions frequently in all the populations except one with @xmath16 ( this exceptional population is discarded from further analysis , see supporting information ) . averaged among the @xmath21 players of these @xmath22 populations , the probabilities that a player adopts action @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 at one game round are , respectively , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( mean @xmath26 s.d . ) .",

    "these results are consistent with ne and suggest the ne mixed strategy is a good description of a player s marginal distribution of actions",
    ". however , a player s actions at two consecutive times are not independent but correlated ( fig .",

    "the players are more likely to repeat their last action than to shift action either counter - clockwise ( i.e. , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , see fig .",

    "then the expected total earning in rmb for a player will be the same ( @xmath115 rmb ) in the five sets of experimental sessions under the assumption of mixed - strategy nash equilibrium , which predicts the expected payoff of each player in one game round to be @xmath116 .",
    "the actual numerical value of @xmath113 and the above - mentioned reward formula were listed in the written instruction and also orally mentioned by the experimental instructor at the instruction phase of the experiment .",
    "the rps game has a mixed - strategy nash equilibrium ( ne ) , in which every player of the population adopts the three actions ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) with the same probability @xmath5 in each round of the game .",
    "here we give a proof of this statement .",
    "we also demonstrate that , the empirically observed action marginal probabilities of individual players are consistent with the ne mixed strategy .    consider a population of @xmath90 individuals playing repeatedly the rps game under the random pairwise - matching protocol .",
    "let us define @xmath117 ( respectively , @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) as the probability that a player @xmath109 of the population ( @xmath120 ) will choose action @xmath0 ( respectively , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) in one game round . if a player @xmath121 chooses action @xmath0 , what is her expected payoff in one play ?",
    "since this player has equal chance @xmath122 of pairing with any another player @xmath109 , the expected payoff is simply @xmath123 . by the same argument",
    "we see that if player @xmath121 chooses action @xmath1 and @xmath2 the expected payoff @xmath124 and @xmath125 in one play are , respectively , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "if every player of the population chooses the three actions with equal probability , namely that @xmath128 for @xmath129 , then the expected payoff for a player is the same no matter which action she chooses in one round of the game , i.e. , @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "then the expected payoff of a player @xmath109 in one game round is @xmath116 , which will not increase if the probabilities @xmath132 deviate from @xmath5 .",
    "therefore @xmath133 ( for all @xmath131 ) is a mixed - strategy ne of the game .",
    "let us also discuss a little bit about the uniqueness of this mixed - strategy ne . if the payoff parameter @xmath134 , this mixed - strategy ne is not unique .",
    "we can easily check that @xmath135 ( for all @xmath131 ) is a pure - strategy ne .",
    "similarly , @xmath136 ( @xmath131 ) and @xmath137 ( @xmath131 ) are two other pure - strategy nes .",
    "in such a pure - strategy ne the payoff of a player is @xmath138 in one game round .",
    "this value is considerably higher than the average payoff of @xmath116 a player will gain if the population is in the above mentioned mixed - strategy ne .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the payoff parameter @xmath4 , then there is no pure - strategy ne for the rps game .",
    "this is simple to prove .",
    "suppose the population is initially in a pure - strategy ne with @xmath139 for @xmath131 .",
    "if one player now shifts to action @xmath2 , her payoff will increase from @xmath138 to @xmath3 .",
    "therefore this player will keep the new action @xmath2 in later rounds of the game , and the original pure - strategy ne is then destroyed .",
    "we believe that the mixed - strategy ne of @xmath133 ( for @xmath140 ) is the only nash equilibrium of our rps game in the whole parameter region of @xmath4 ( except for very few isolated values of @xmath3 , maybe ) .",
    "unfortunately we are unable to offer a rigorous proof of this conjecture for a generic value of population size @xmath90 . but this conjecture is supported by our empirical observations , see table  s1 .    among the @xmath10 experimental sessions performed at different values of @xmath3",
    ", we observed that all the players in @xmath22 experimental sessions change their actions frequently .",
    "the mean values of the individual action probabilities @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 are all close to @xmath5 .",
    "( the slightly higher mean probability of choosing action @xmath0 in the empirical data of table  s1 might be linked to the fact that  rock \" is the left - most candidate choice in each player s decision window . )",
    "we did notice considerable deviation from the ne mixed strategy in one experimental session of @xmath16 , though .",
    "after the rps game has proceeded for @xmath105 rounds , the six players of this exceptional session all stick to the same action r and do not shift to the other two actions .",
    "this population obviously has reached a highly cooperative state after @xmath105 game rounds with @xmath141 for all the six players . as we have pointed out ,",
    "such a cooperative state is not a pure - strategy ne .",
    "we do not consider this exceptional experimental session in the data analysis and model building phase of this work .",
    "we now demonstrate that the mixed - strategy ne with @xmath133 ( @xmath131 ) is an evolutionarily stable strategy only when the payoff parameter @xmath7 .    to check for the evolutionary stability of this mixed - strategy ne , let us assume a mutation occurs to the population such that @xmath142 players now adopt a mutated strategy , while the remaining @xmath143 players still adopt the ne mixed strategy .",
    "we denote by @xmath144 ( and respectively , @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) as the probability that in one round of the game , action @xmath0 ( respectively , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) will be chosen by a player who adopts the mutated strategy .",

    "[ [ eq : tildeg ] ] that the expected payoff @xmath149 of the mutated strategy never exceeds that of the ne mixed strategy .",
    "therefore the ne mixed strategy is an evolutionarily stable strategy .",
    "notice that the difference @xmath156 is proportional to @xmath86 , therefore the larger the value of @xmath3 , the higher is the cost of deviating from the ne mixed strategy",

    "therefore the ne mixed strategy is an evolutionarily unstable strategy .",
    "the mixed - strategy ne for the game with payoff parameter @xmath8 is referred to as evolutionarily neutral since it is neither evolutionarily stable nor evolutionarily unstable .",
    "we now demonstrate that the empirically observed persistent cycling behaviors could not have been observed if the population were in the mixed - strategy ne , and they can not be explained by the independent decision model either .",
    "if the population is in the mixed - strategy ne , each player will pick an action uniformly at random at each time @xmath15 .",
