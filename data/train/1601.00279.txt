    "describing a quantum state in phase space @xcite is a very useful approach to make a comparison between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics .",
    "it provides a valuable insight into the phenomenon of quantum - to - classical transition @xcite and a powerful tool to manifest nonclassical effects in quantum optics @xcite and continuous variable ( cv ) quantum informatics @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable distinctions between quantum and classical phase - space distributions is that a negative value is allowed for a quantum state .",
    "although the negativity in phase space thus demonstrates nonclassicality immediately , it enables us to detect only a limited subset of nonclassical states .",
    "there exist nonclassical states with positive - definite distributions , e.g. , gaussian states with squeezing , which are readily accessible within current technology and provide important practical resources for cv quantum informatics @xcite .",
    "it is fundamentally and practically important to have a simple test manifesting nonclassicality @xcite beyond the negativity in phase space .    in this respect",
    ", there was a seminal work by banaszek and wdkiewicz @xcite ( bw ) , who proposed a method to test the bell nonlocality directly in phase space . unlike the bell test using homodyne detection , which requires the transformation of a gaussian state to a non - gaussian state having a nonpositive wigner function @xcite , bw formalism enables us to detect nonclassical correlation even with a positive - definite wigner function .",
    "it has been extended to generalized quasiprobability functions @xcite and multipartite systems @xcite .",
    "recently , we have theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated a single - mode nonclassicality test using the wigner function @xcite in analogy with bw formalism .",
    "we here extend this recent work by using generalized quasiprobability functions .",
    "we not only give more details of the proposal in @xcite , but we also investigate other relevant aspects , e.g. , robustness of our tests against experimental imperfections including photon loss , finite data , and a nonoptimal choice of phase - space points .",
    "furthermore , we introduce an optimized test of genuine non - gaussianity employing three phase - space points , as an addition to the four - point test in @xcite .",
    "we also make a direct connection between our single - mode test and the bw nonlocality test , particularly showing that the single - mode nonclassical states detected under our parallelogram test can be a useful resource to make a two - mode state manifesting nonlocality under the bw test .",
    "our starting point is the observation that every pair of orthogonal quadratures in phase space behaves as independent realistic variables for a coherent state . exploiting it , we propose two nonclassicality tests that take four and three points at the vertices of a rectangle and a right triangle , respectively .",
    "our tests detect a broad range of nonclassical gaussian states , including all pure states . identifying the upper bounds for all gaussian states and their mixtures",
    ", we also propose tests for genuine quantum non - gaussianity .",
    "non - gaussian resources are known to be essential for many quantum informatic tasks , including universal cv quantum computation @xcite , entanglement distillation @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , and cv nonlocality testing @xcite .",
    "a simple method to obtain a non - gaussian state would be to prepare a finite mixture of gaussian states .",
    "however , we can not claim such a state as a genuine non - gaussian resource . in dealing with non - gaussianity in quantum phase space ,",
    "it is important to distinguish a genuinely quantum non - gaussian state from a mixture of gaussian states @xcite .",
    "we further optimize our non - gaussianity tests by taking points from a parallelogram ( triangle ) instead of a rectangle ( right triangle ) , which essentially realizes a squeezing operation on a given state without actually implementing it .",
    "we also discuss the fundamental and the practical limits of our tests .",
    "note that there exists a one - to - one correspondence between a @xmath0-parametrized phase - space distribution and a loss mechanism , i.e. , interaction with a vacuum reservoir @xcite .",
    "this correspondence might suggest that the limits of the @xmath0-parametrized distributions are the same as those of the wigner function ( @xmath1 ) under a lossy gaussian channel .",
    "however , they can yield different results for a nontrivial test .",
    "we show that the former can detect more states than the latter when a test sets a bound varying with the parameter @xmath0 , e.g. , the case of our non - gaussianity tests .",
    "we demonstrate that our tests are able to detect a nonclassical state reliably even when the number of data is finite and the measurement setting deviates from the optimal setting . we also show that our parallelogram test can detect genuine non - gaussianity for a range of superposition states with loss above 50% , at which the wigner function becomes positive definite .",
    "finally , we show that our parallelogram test can identify useful resources for a nonlocality test in phase space . it may open a direction for future works , e.g. , on a deeper understanding of the relation between nonclassicality and nonlocality .",
    "the @xmath0-parametrized quasiprobability function of a quantum state @xmath2 is defined as @xcite @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the displacement operator with complex amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "the operator @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 which yields , e.g. , a parity operator @xmath8 and a vacuum state @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , corresponding to the well - known wigner and @xmath12 functions , respectively . as the eigenvalues of @xmath6 are @xmath13 ( @xmath14 : non - negative integers ) , the @xmath0-parametrized quasiprobability function is bounded as @xmath15 this shows that the lower bound becomes minimum for the wigner function ( @xmath1 ) and approaches zero with @xmath0 decreasing . the above equation",
    "also clearly tells us that the @xmath12 function ( @xmath16 ) is non - negative .",
    "while the parameter @xmath0 can have a positive value up to 1 ( @xmath17 function ) , we only deal with a nonpositive @xmath0 throughout the paper as the eigenvalues of @xmath18 become unbounded for @xmath19 .    ,",
    "the remaining three points form a right triangle in eq .  .",
    "( b ) optimal choice of rectangle for testing a squeezed state occurs at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 : squeezing axis ) , that is , when the axes of the rectangle are oriented midway between the squeezed and the antisqueezed axes . ]",
    "interestingly , the @xmath0-parametrized quasiprobability function of a coherent state @xmath22 is factorized as a product of two gaussian distributions for every pair of orthogonal quadratures , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a coordinate system rotated by an angle @xmath25 from @xmath26 [ fig .",

    "demonstrates the nonclassicality of a single - mode state .    at this point",
    ", it may be intriguing to ask how many phase - space points should be considered to come up with a meaningful nonclassicality test , particularly to test a positive quasiprobability distribution .",
    "can we obtain a useful nonclassicality criterion employing less numbers of points than four in eq .  ?",
    "of course , verifying nonclassicality from an _ arbitrary _ set of points is impossible without specifications on the chosen points @xmath51 , like a predetermined position ( origin ) with energy constraint in @xcite or a designated shape ( rectangle ) in our case @xcite .",
    "for example , if we construct a test exploiting the values at fully arbitrary @xmath52 points without specifying locations , that is , @xmath53 $ ] where @xmath54 with @xmath55 , every result from a set of positive values ( @xmath56 ) is mimicked by a single vacuum state because the same values can be found at @xmath57 for @xmath55 . in this sense ,",
    "if we intend to introduce a specified shape as a constraint , the least number of points is possibly three with the shape of triangle , whereas the test in eq .   adopts a rectangle with four points .",

    ", it has no analogy with a nonlocality test , as @xmath65 is saturated by a hidden variable theory : @xmath66 yields @xmath67 , which are also the quantum bounds due to @xmath68 .",
    "note that the optimal values of @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath70 $ ] for a given state @xmath2 are invariant under displacement and rotation .",
    "let us assume that a state @xmath2 has an optimal value at points @xmath71 , and then a displaced state @xmath72 has the same optimum at shifted points @xmath73 .",
    "this is because the displacement operator only translates the center of the quasiprobability function while preserving its entire profile .",
    "similarly , if a state has the optimal value at points @xmath71 where the coordinate system is oriented at angle @xmath25 , a rotated state @xmath74 has the same optimum in the coordinate system now oriented at angle @xmath75 , since the phase - rotation also preserves the profile of the quasiprobability function .",
