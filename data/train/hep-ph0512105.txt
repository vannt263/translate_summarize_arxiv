    "two model calculations exist for the real part of the tpe amplitude @xcite , and they qualitatively confirm that the exchange of two hard photons may be responsible for this discrepancy . in order to extract the electric form factor in the model independent way , one has thus to study the general case of compton scattering with two spacelike photons .",

    "the real part of the tpe amplitude is given by a dispersion integral over its imaginary part .",
    "therefore , a good understanding of this class of observables is absolutely necessary .",

    "have been performed in different kinematics @xcite .",
    "+ though small ( several to tens ppm ) , this asymmetry can be measured with a precision of fractions of ppm . before implementing different models for the real part , where an additional uncertainty comes from the dispersion integral over the imaginary part",
    ", one should check the level of understanding of the imaginary part of tpe .",
    "these checks have been done for the existing data .",
    "inclusion of the elastic ( nucleon ) intermediate state only @xcite led to negative asymmetry of several ppm in the kinematics of sample experiment but was not enough to describe the data .",
    "the description of the beam normal spin asymmetry within a phenomenological model which uses the full set of the single pion electroproduction @xcite did not give satisfactory description at any of the available kinematics .",
    "especially intriguing appears the situation with the sample data with electron lab energy @xmath4 mev , which is just above the pion production threshold where the theoretical input is well understood .",
    "on the other hand , an eft calculation without dynamical pions @xcite was somewhat surprisingly very successful in describing this kinematics for @xmath3 .",
    "this success suggests that to the given order of chiral perturbation theory , the role of the dynamical pions for this observable might be not too large . finally , a recent calculation within the leading logarithm approximation appeared , where only few dominant multipoles were used as input @xcite .",
    "surprizingly , the authors of @xcite were able to describe all the experimental data at very different beam energies and scattering angles , while the full calculation of @xcite failed to describe any of them .",
    "+ though even at low energies the situation with the imaginary part of tpe amplitude is by far not clear , an attention has to be paid to high energies , as well , since the dispersion integral which would give us its real part , should be performed over the full energy range . due to relative ease of measuring @xmath3 within the framework of parity violating electron scattering , new data from running and upcoming experiments @xcite will stimulate further theoretical investigations of this new observable .",
    "a calculation of @xmath3 in hard kinematics regime at high energy and momentum transfer was performed recently in the framework of generalized parton distributions ( gpd s ) and resulted in asymmetries of @xmath5 ppm . @xcite .",
    "+ since a ppm effect measurement at high momentum transfers is an extremely complicated task , the forward kinematics seems more favorable . for this kinematics",

    ", the authors obtained estimates of @xmath3 in this kinematics as large as 25 - 35 ppm .",
    "the calculation of @xcite appeared afterwards showed that this result is not adequate , since the squared log term can only contribute with the compton scattering amplitudes with the photon helicity flip .",

    "the predictions for @xmath3 shifted correspondingly to @xmath11 ppm and agree with the preliminary data from happex experiment @xcite . +",
    "in order to provide an estimate of @xmath3 , we use the equivalent photon or quasi - real compton scattering approximation which is caused by the hard collinear kinematics , responsible for this @xmath9 enhancement . in this approximation ,",
    "the leading contribution comes from the kinematical region with both exchanged photons are almost real .",
    "the hadronic tensor is taken at this kinematical point and can be taken out of the integration . for the hadronic tensor , we adopt the most general real compton scattering amplitude and demostrate that the contribution of the cross section ( i.e. , photon helicity conserving amplitudes ) vanishes in the qrcs approximation .",

    ", it is interesting to observe this fact in view of somewhat surprising success of the effective field description of the sample data point on @xmath3 without pion contribution .",
    "this might give a hint that the pion contribution to @xmath3 at low energies is suppressed by the pion mass , if calculated to the same order .",
    "recently , beam normal spin asymmetry was studied in the hard scattering regime @xcite in the framework of the handbag mechanism . in this picture",
    ", the process factorizes into the hard part ( electron scattering off an on - shell quark with the exchange of two spacelike photons ) and the soft part which is parametrized by the generalized parton distributions ( gpd s ) . however , one can not access the qrcs kinematics here , since it is impossible for an on - shell quark to absorb ( emit ) a hard real photon and remain on - shell . as it has been noticed before",
    ", the qrcs kinematics selects the rcs amplitudes with the photon helicity flip , i.e. the helicity changes by two units . in the context of the gpd s , helicity amplitudes with the helicity changed by 2 units were considered in several works . in the collinear kinematics , this requires that scattering occurs on a parton of spin 1 , that is gluon .",
    "the corresponding gluon helicity flip gpd s were introduced in @xcite & & e^ix <",
    "ps|f^(.(-n ) f^.)(-n)|ps > + & & = h_t_g(x , ) |n(p,s ) n(p , s ) + & & + e_t_g(x , ) |n(p,s ) n(p , s ) where @xmath139 are the double helicity flip gluon gpd s , @xmath140 , and the matrix element is taken between the initial and final nucleon states with the momenta @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and spins @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "the integration is performed along the light - cone vector @xmath145 . @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the longitudinal parton momentum fraction and skewness parameter , respectively . furthermore , @xmath148 $ ] and @xmath149 $ ] are antisymmetric pairs of indices , while @xmath150 means symmetrization and removal of the trace .",
    "these operations are essential since the product of operators must transform as irreducible representations of the lorentz group .",
    "this requirement rules out the possibility to see these gpd s in the qrcs kinematics , since it is exactly the trace of the rcs tensor that contributes to @xmath3 in the qrcs regime , c.f .",
    "eq.([eq : tensor_contraction ] ) .",
    "so , our conclusion is that in the qrcs kinematics , contributions from generalized parton distributions are ruled out .",
    "in summary , we presented a calculation of the beam normal spin asymmetry .",
    "this observable obtains its leading contribution from the imaginary part of the two photon exchange graph times the born amplitude and is directly related to the imaginary part of doubly virtual compton scattering the resulting loop integral obtains a large contribution from the kinematics when both exchanged photons are nearly real and collinear to the external electrons .",
    "we adopt the qrcs or equivalent photons approximation which allows to take the hadronic part out of the integral and to perform the integration over the electron phase space analytically . for the hadronic part",
    ", we use the full real compton scattering amplitude and show , that only photon helicity flipping amplitudes contribute in this observable in the qrcs approximation . at low energies",
    ", we relate this helicity flipping compton amplitude to the @xmath0 multipoles and discuss the contributions of different multipoles .    at high energies and forward scattering angles ( regge regime ) , we provide an explicite calculation which is due to two pion exchange in the @xmath13-channel .",
    "the resulting values of the asymmetry are of the order @xmath132 ppm for the energies in the range @xmath151 gev .",
    "we conclude that the double logarithmic enhancement does not dominate @xmath3 in forward regime since it comes with helicity - flip compton amplitude which highly suppresses this behaviour .",
    "finally , we consider possible contributions to @xmath3 in the hard kinematics , among which contributions from quark and gluon gpd s and show that such contributions are ruled out in the qrcs kinematics .    the author is grateful to prof .",

    "the work was supported by italian miur and infn , and by us department of energy contract de - fg02 - 05er41361 .",
    "in this section we present calculation of the integrals over electron phase space appearing in the qrcs approximation .",
    "first we calculate the scalar integral @xmath152 , i_0=_0^k_thr , where the upper integration limit @xmath153 corresponds to the inelastic threshold ( i.e. pion production ) , @xmath154 .",
    "we next introduce integration over the feynman parameter @xmath155",
    "we chose the polar axis such as @xmath156 with @xmath157 and perform angular integration .",
    "we furthermore change integration over @xmath158 to integration over dimensionsless @xmath159 i_0&= & _",
    "me^e_thre + & & , to perform the integration over the electron energy , we follow here the main details of the calculation in appendix a of ref.@xcite .",
    "the result reads i_0= \\",
    "{ ^2()+ 8sp(e_thre ) } , where @xmath65 is the spence or dilog function , @xmath66 with @xmath67 . in the high energy limit , @xmath68",
    ", we recover the result of ref.@xcite .",
    "the vector and tensor integrals can be reduced to the scalar ones by means of standard methods @xcite .",
    "the remaining integrals to be calculated are the two , three , and four - point scalar integrals . here",
    "we are only interested in the imaginary part of these , therefore there are only three integrals with non - zero imaginary part : the two - point integral c^_0&=&im + & = & , with @xmath160 ; the three - point one b^_0&=&im + & & + & = & - , and finally , the four - point integral : a^_0&=&im + & & + & = & + & & .",
    "these integrals should however be reggeised as described in section [ sec : results ] by substituting the regge propagator instead of the feynman one . denoting @xmath161 and @xmath162 the momentum transferred by the pions in the @xmath13-channel , we have for the reggeized version of scalar integrals : ( c^_0)^r&=&d_(t_1-m_^2)p_^r(_(t_1 ) ) + & & ( t_2-m_^2)p_^r(_(t_2 ) ) ( b^_0)^r&=&d_(t_1-m_^2 ) + & & _ ^r(_(t_1 ) ) p_^r(_(t_2)),(a^_0)^r = d__^r(_(t_1 ) ) p_^r(_(t_2 ) ) similarly , in the case of the @xmath115-exchange in the @xmath113-channel , the integrals with non - zero imaginary part are : c^_0&=&im + & = & , b^_0&=&im + & & + & = & -,a^_0&=&im + & & + & = & + & & , with @xmath163 , and @xmath164 .",
    "if neglecting the pion mass , @xmath165 .",
    "the reggeization procedure is the same as for @xmath0- intermediate state .",
