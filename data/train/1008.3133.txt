    "the lack of centrality dependence in the baryon to meson ratios in cu+cu and au+au data , points to similar freeze - out temperatures for the studied systems .",
    "the constant values of @xmath2 at rhic energies for collisions with different initial conditions , energy and net - baryon density , points to a common hadronization temperature of the systems .",
    "another parameter extracted from the fit , which is related to strangeness production , is the strangeness suppression factor , @xmath63 , shown versus @xmath45   in fig .",
    "[ fig : chemicalfo ] .",
    "the suppression of strange hadron yields is observed in smaller systems , such as @xmath1  and peripheral collisions . within statistical models",
    "this can be explained by a reduced production volume  @xcite . at low beam energies , where equilibration of @xmath68 quarks with respect to @xmath69 and @xmath56 is not expected",
    ", the suppression is also seen .",
    "we find that within the systematic errors on the fit parameters the strangeness suppression factor in cu+cu is consistent with that for au+au for the same number of charged particles , @xmath45 .",
    "as only charged kaon yields were included in the fit , this observation is directly related to an absence of any additional enhancement in @xmath54 at the same @xmath45  in the smaller cu+cu system with respect to the larger au+au system as discussed previously .",
    "the @xmath63 parameter shows a similar increase with centrality for both systems and energies .",
    "the value of @xmath63 approaching unity for the central au+au collisions in the context of thermal model would imply that the produced strangeness is close to equilibrium .",
    "we have presented measurements of identified charged hadron spectra in cu+cu collisions for two center - of - mass energies , 200 and 62.4  gev .",
    "these new results of @xmath20 , k@xmath32 and @xmath17(@xmath23 ) have further enriched the variety of low-@xmath8  spectra at rhic .",
    "the data have been studied within the statistical hadronization and blast - wave model frameworks in order to characterize the properties of the final hadronic state of the colliding system as a function of system size , collision energy and centrality .",
    "these multidimensional systematic studies reveal remarkable similarities between the different colliding systems .",
    "no additional enhancement of kaon yields with respect to pions is observed for the smaller cu+cu system compared to au+au .",
    "the obtained particle ratios , mean-@xmath8  and the freeze - out parameters , including the strangeness suppression factor , @xmath63 , are found to exhibit a smooth evolution with @xmath45 , and similar properties at the same number of produced charged hadrons are observed for all collision systems and center - of - mass energies .",
    "the bulk properties studied have a strong correspondence with the total particle yield . within thermal models",
    "this reflects a relation between the energy per particle at freeze - out and the entropy derived from particle yields , which reflects the initial state properties for adiabatic expansion .",
    "the baryon chemical potential could in addition be influenced by the initial valence quark distribution and by baryon transport during expansion , leading to a more complicated dependence .",
    "the scaling features of freeze - out properties are not presented at the same @xmath55  for lighter and heavier ions as scaling is badly broken when data measured at different energies are compared .",
    "this suggests that @xmath55  does not reflect the initial state of the system accurately .",
