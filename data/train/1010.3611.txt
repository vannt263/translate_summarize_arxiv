    "this issue can be tackled through the present time - dependent approach .",
    "the coupled - channels density - matrix ( ccdm ) technique was first introduced in studies of quantum molecular dynamics @xcite , and has recently been applied to investigate the coupling - assisted quantum tunneling in heavy - ion fusion @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite provides a didactic discussion on the ccdm approach . in contradistinction to this approach , most of the dynamical models @xcite of dissipative nuclear collisions do _ not _ treat the relative motion of the nuclei quantum - mechanically and/or use _ incoherent _ ( statistically averaged ) rather than _ decoherent _ ( partially coherent ) reaction channels .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the innovative ideas of the ccdm approach .",
    "the situation can be imagined as an orchestra ( representing the reduced quantum system ) , where the director plays the role of the relative motion and the musicians correspond to a few intrinsic , low - lying collective states .",
    "now imagine an airplane appearing overhead , representing the environment of innumerable nucleonic states .",
    "when the airplane is not present , the orchestra plays a marvelous music , all musicians are in sync , like in a coherent quantum superposition .",
    "but when the airplane approaches , the listener percieves two effects due to interference : ( i ) the music gets attenuated ( dissipation ) and , most importantly , ( ii ) the quality of the music changes , as the musicians play out of sync ( decoherence ) .",
    "decoherence , which always accompanies dissipation in open quantum systems @xcite , means dynamical dislocalization of coherent quantum superpositions due to entanglement of the system with its environment @xcite .",
    "coherent quantum superpositions are the basis of the coherent coupled - channels approach to near - barrier reaction dynamics , which manifest themselves through experimental fusion - barrier distributions @xcite .",
    "dissipation of energy and angular momentum is revealed in heavy - ion deep - inelastic scattering that occurs at near - barrier energies as well @xcite .",
    "cross sections of deep - inelastic collisions also indicate loss of angular - momentum coherence @xcite . while the coherent coupled - channels calculations @xcite are able to explain several collision observables , major problems are unresolved .",
    "foremost is the inability to describe the elastic and quasi - elastic scattering and fusion processes simultaneously @xcite and the related , more recent failure to describe consistently below - barrier quantum tunneling and above - barrier fusion yields @xcite .",
    "new , precise fusion measurements have inevitably led to phenomenological ( sometimes contradictory ) adjustments @xcite to stationary - state coupled - channels models to fit the experimental data , but without a physically consistent foundation .",
    "complementary to fusion experiments , precision measurements of back - angle scattering energy spectra @xcite and quasi - elastic barrier distributions @xcite clearly indicate that complex , dynamical processes ( other than the low - lying collective excitation of the interacting nuclei @xcite ) play an important role in low - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this paper suggests that quantum decoherence and dissipation should be simultaneously included in a consistent description of low - energy reaction dynamics , when a restricted set of ( relevant ) degrees of freedom is employed .",
    "a possible description is the ccdm approach whose formalism is described in sec .",

    "various types of environments can coexist in a nuclear collision , which may be specific to particular degrees of freedom , such as isospin asymmetry or weak binding . among these environments , which can be coupled to specific states or to all states of the reduced system , are ( i ) the high level - density of one- and multi - nucleonic excitations in different mass / charge partitions ( transfer ) , ( ii ) the continuum of non - resonant decay states of weakly - bound nuclei ( breakup ) , and ( iii ) the innumerable nuclear molecular ( compound nucleus ) states ( fusion ) .",
