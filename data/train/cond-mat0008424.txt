    "understanding the development of a landscape in terms of fundamental mechanical principles is a formidable task @xcite . in spite of this high complexity",
    ", recent theoretical studies have resulted in considerable progresses by considering the issue from a viewpoint analogous to the one taken in conventional critical phenomena @xcite where simple models are exploited to identify universality classes .",
    "the main idea of this approach is indeed to focus on few fundamental ingredients which , in the spirit of critical phenomena , are expected to provide a reasonable description of the large - scales properties of the network .",
    "the remarkable properties of river networks have been known for some time and they can be condensed in few phenomenological scaling laws which have been confirmed to hold in the observational data @xcite . while these laws do not explain the underlying physical mechanisms , they nevertheless provide guidelines for their search .",
    "hence any newly proposed model for river networks ought to be tested against these laws . in the language of critical phenomena ,",
    "those scaling laws can be used to derive critical exponents and thus discriminate among different universality classes . among such laws a fundamental role in the physics of the erosion of a landscape due to the flow of water over it , is played by the slope - area law ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "a few langevin - like equations have been recently proposed for describing the evolution of the landscape under the effect of erosional processes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , reparametrization invariance arguments @xcite were used to derive a dynamical equation which yields the slope - area law as a stationary state .",
    "the same equation was obtained by somafai and sander @xcite using landau arguments .",
    "other proposals have also been advanced @xcite,@xcite .    the equation proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , was studied both analytically in 1 + 1 dimensions ( one spatial and one temporal ) and numerically using a self - consistent ( sc ) solution in 2 + 1 dimensions , and it was shown to predict a fairly reasonable stationary state quite different from the starting network acting as initial condition .",
    "this type of analysis hinges on the observation that the network representing the river has an evolution mirroring that of the evolution profile .",
    "other methods have also been devised which directly address the topological properties of the network itself , the best known being the optimal channel networks ( ocn ) @xcite .",
    "this is a lattice model where a functional describing the dissipated energy is minimized in order to find the optimal configuration and it is based on the idea that , presumably , the erosional process taking place on a landscape is driven by a strive for optimality . a simulating annealing procedure @xcite has been implemented to this aim both at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite . while the latter is aimed to find the absolute minimum , the former is expected to display local minima only . using exact bounds and finite - size scaling , maritan",
    "et al ( @xcite ) showed that the absolute minimum belongs to the mean - field universality class , that , in turn , means that the corresponding network has a highly symmetric pattern with small rivers draining into bigger rivers in a predictable way ( this network is akin to the peano basin @xcite ) .",
    "however this minimum is not easily reachable in the space of all configurations , and one is then led to suspect that real rivers are better described by configurations related to local minima .",
    "we further note that stationary states of the aforementioned dynamical equations , are also expected to be associated with local minima for the same reason .    in view of the above discussion",
    ", it is apparent that a more complete description of the stability and the scaling behavior associated with these local minima would be desirable .",
    "the present work is an attempt in this direction .",
    "our aims are threefold .",
    "our first goal is the full characterization of the possible universality class associated with local minima . using the sc numerical procedure envisaged in ref .",
    "@xcite , we extend previous numerical results both in size and statistics and we use a finite size procedure for a more accurate estimate of the exponents .",
    "we then compare these exponents with those calculated using a zero - temperature simulation in the ocn framework with similar sizes and statistics .",
    "our second goal is the generalization of the dynamical equation to include a tunable parameter which turns out to be related to the @xmath1 parameter considered in ocns and which is responsible of the aggregation mechanism . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the _ absolute _ minimum is insensitive to a variation of @xmath0 in the interval @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we find that although the final patterns display marked differences as a function of @xmath0 , critical exponents show a much smaller discrepancy , which our results indicate to be marginal ( at the edge of error bars ) , both in the sc and ocn case .",
    "finally we test the stability of our results against a variation in the initial conditions .",
    "we find that even in this case a marginal difference appears in the effective critical exponents .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : deq ] , we review the dynamical equation whereas in sec.[sec : exp ] scaling laws and critical exponents are briefly recalled .",
    "sec.[sec : ocn ] contains the definition of ocn and our results are presented in sec.[sec : results ] .",
    "finally sec.[sec : conclusions ] contains some concluding remarks and future perspectives .",
    "a rather general dynamical equation consistent with general principles , and capturing the physics of erosional processes occurring in river basin , is @xcite,@xcite : @xmath3 ^ 2+\\eta(x , t ) \\label{sc1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the height of the landscape and the flow rate at position @xmath6 and time @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a noise term and @xmath9 is a parameter which will be related to @xmath0 ( see below ) .",
    "the constant term @xmath10 on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ sc1 ] ) mimics the so - called geological uplift which is known to originate by tectonic forces .",
    "the second term represents a local diffusion term of strength @xmath11 , condensing both smoothing ( rounding of hilltops ) and sedimentation ( filling of valleys ) processes .",
    "the third term is non - local and corresponds to an erosion driven by the waterflow on a surface with @xmath5 representing the flow through site @xmath6 .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 is a parameter of the model which was assumed to be equal to @xmath12 in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite .",
    "the last noise term is added to account for small - scale stochastic processes such as rainfall fluctuations . in the attempt of extracting the basic features associated with the third term",
    ", one can ignore both the diffusion and noise terms ( the accuracy of this approximation has been discussed in ref.@xcite ) . in this case ,",
    "a stationary state is obtained when the uplift term balances the flow dependent erosional term , that is when @xmath13 where , for later convenience , we define @xmath14 . most of previous work was performed with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) ( there are few exceptions but with aims and methodologies different from ours , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    "( [ sc2 ] ) is known as slope - area law @xcite , which is a robust empirical law verified by real field observational data .",
    "we shall see later on how @xmath9 is related to the dissipated energy functional . here",
    "we note that if we assume ( as we shall do hereafter ) uniform rainfall ( and no ground water ) , then @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the area of the basin draining into point @xmath6 at time @xmath7 .",
    "the basic result of this dynamical equation is that the non - linear term is able to account for the correct relationship between local slope and water flowrate .",
    "river networks are a remarkable example of systems governed by scaling laws .",
    "although the concept of power and scaling laws has been known to the hydrologists for half a century , it was not until recently that this concept was put into a well defined framework @xcite,@xcite in analogy with conventional non - equilibrium critical phenomena where power laws are associated with critical exponents . for the sake of completeness , we shall briefly review here a few of the central laws appearing in river networks which we regards as the most fundamental .",
    "hack observed that the total area @xmath19 draining into a given point and the upstream length @xmath20 going from that point to the source though the path of maximum water flow , were not independent but related by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is often referred as hack s exponent and it ranges in the interval @xmath23 $ ] in real rivers .",
    "the distributions of drainage areas and upstream lengths also follow a power law . within the context of finite - size scaling ,",
    "these may be written as @xcite @xmath24 for areas and @xmath25 for lengths . in eq .",
    "( [ cr2 ] ) @xmath26 is the distribution of drainage areas on a basin of size @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a finite size function .",
    "it defines two critical exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 which are not independent @xcite . similarly @xmath31 is the distribution of the upstream lengths on a basin of size @xmath27",
    ", @xmath32 is a finite size function and there exists a relation between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath30 and @xmath34 define the `` typical '' area ( @xmath35 ) and length ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "finally we remark that one usually distinguishes between self - affine basins ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) and self - similar basins ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) @xcite and in both cases only one exponent out of four is independent .",
    "they are related via scaling relations as @xcite , @xcite,@xcite @xmath41",
    "within the context of the ocns , the `` dissipated energy '' of a river network at a given time , can be written , in continuum notations , as @xcite : @xmath42 the local gradient @xmath43 and the water flow rate @xmath5 are expected to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ sc2 ] ) .",
    "hence one gets : @xmath44 we note that although the energy expression ( [ ocn2 ] ) has been derived in the context of ocn @xcite , in principle it could be defined in the evolution equation ( [ sc1 ] ) as well , thus providing a way of monitoring the rate of approach to steady state .",
    "the basic assumption of the ocn is that there is a tendency of any real river basin , to assume a configuration which minimizes eq .",
    "( [ ocn2 ] ) .",
    "a natural question arising is the characterization of the local and absolute minima of @xmath45 .",
    "it was shown @xcite , that the _ absolute minimum _ of @xmath45 is insensitive to a variation of the value of @xmath0 in the interval @xmath2 @xcite and then @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath37 .",
    "the analogous issue in the case of local minima is much less clear .",
    "in fact , when @xmath48 , numerical work @xcite suggests that there exists a set of local minima which presumably corresponds to a new universality class that is the relevant one for real rivers .",
    "indeed only exceptional events are able to radically modify river courses and so local minima of dissipated energy trap the system with high probability and therefore dominate the statistics .",
    "it is then a vital issue to discriminate whether or not local minima configurations are indeed related to a well defined and robust universality class independent on @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , we describe numerical procedures and results in detail for each case .",
    "all calculations are carried out on a @xmath49 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions in one direction which we identify as the transverse direction .",
    "multiple outlets are allowed in the outflowing longitudinal direction ( west side in the figures ) whereas an infinite wall is set up on the opposite side ( east side ) .",
    "all averages considered in the statistics are carried out only over the river with the largest flow .",
    "it is worth stressing that the choice of considering only the maximum river in a multiple outlets environment corresponds to consider the statistical behavior of rivers that are in competition to drain a given region . on the other hand ,",
    "a single river within a given region is more appropriate if geological constraints are known to exist .",
    "typically 8 nearest - neighbors ( nn ) - 4 associated with the square lattice and 4 associated with the two diagonal directions - are allowed .",
    "a somewhat more restricted choice considers only the 4 natural nn associated with the square lattice structure . in view of universality one would expect that the details of the lattice structure should not matter .",
    "this second choice has the considerable advantage of being less time consuming for numerical purposes .",
    "for this reason , although all following figures display patterns obtained with 8 nn , the results reported in this work are obtained with statistics based on 4 nn . in one example",
    ", we have explicitly checked that the outcomes using the two choices are consistent within the statistical errors .    finally , in all our networks",
    ", the drainage area @xmath18 is computed , at each time step , in a standard way according to @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes all sites @xmath52 which drain into @xmath6 and the last term on the right hand side represents a unit rainfall input on each site at all times .",
    "there are many possible initial conditions that can be used in numerical analysis of river networks .",
    "a popular one among hydrologists is a deterministic comb - like structure @xcite .",
    "however this initial condition suffers of various drawbacks @xcite and its use in the multiple outlets case , such the one treated here , appears to be somewhat inconvenient .",
    "hence we consider here two other physically reasonable choices , namely a spanning tree ( st ) and a scheidegger network ( sn ) .",
    "although sts are well known in statistical physics mainly due to their relation with the @xmath53 limit of the potts model @xcite , only recently their topological properties have been studied in details @xcite .",
    "a suitable variation of spanning trees has even been proposed as a topological model for river networks @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we have generated sts with multiple outlets by using an adapted broder s algorithm ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have considered sizes ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath55 and statistics based on a number of configurations ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 respectively .",
    "we have then performed a finite size analysis described in the next subsection to extract the most reliable values of the exponents .",
    "our best result for the exponents are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 in excellent agreement with the exact results @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this also provides a good test on the quality of our data analysis .",
    "note that the exact value of @xmath30 , albeit not known , can be derived from the knowledge of @xmath22 using eq .",
    "( [ cr4 ] ) .",
    "this predicts @xmath67 in perfect agreement with our computed value .",
    "we also note that the obtained results are nearly identical to the one predicted and numerically generated for a single outlet @xcite .    a st is a self - similar network in that it is undirected and isotropic .",
    "a quite different choice ( directed and anisotropic and hence self - affine ) is a sn .",
    "this was again proposed as a topological model for river networks ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the @xmath29 exponent has been exactly determined via a mapping to a one - dimensional model for mass aggregation @xcite .",
    "a similar mapping to a diffusion - reaction model also provides the solution in general dimensionality @xcite .",
    "our best results for the critical exponents with the same statistics as above are @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , which are in excellent agreement with the expected values ( @xmath29 being exact , the others determined via eq .",

    "[ fig2 ] , we depict typical patterns for a st and a sn respectively .",
    "the presence of multiple outlets magnifies the main difference between st and sn .",
    "a st is constructed in such a way that total freedom is given to the meandering of streams , the only constraint being that they all terminate on the same line ( west side in the figures ) .",
    "typically this allows the formation of a main big river of size considerably larger with respect to the others . for sns ,",
    "the east - west preferred direction prevents the forming of such big river and many smaller rivers are usually present as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .      as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : deq ] , we seek the stationary states of the following simplified equation : @xmath77 ^ 2 + \\eta(x , t ) \\label{res1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 .",
    "the stationary averaged states of eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) are expected to conform to eq .",
    "( [ sc2 ] ) . despite the apparent simplicity of the equation",
    ", an explicit numerical solution proves to be rather slow @xcite .",
    "the reason for this can be traced back to the particular form of the erosion term . according to eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) only sites with a non - negligible combination @xmath79 ^ 2 $ ] will affect the change of the pattern .",
    "as it turns out , this yields a long time transient during which the elevation profile evolves very slowly .",
    "since we are mainly interested in stationary states , there is a way out from this situation @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to start with an arbitrary network ( e.g. a st or a sn ) and recursively construct the heights starting from the outlets with the aid of eq .",
    "( [ sc2 ] ) . from the derived landscape , a new network ( in general different from the original one ) can then be obtained by assuming that at each site the outward direction is along the steepest descent path and using eq.([int1 ] ) . the noise term in eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] for various values of @xmath0 .",
    "two remarks are in order .",
    "first we note that the dissipated energy as obtained from the above sc procedure does _ not _ have any physical meaning _ in the transient state_. in other words the definition of `` time '' for the independent variable appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] should be considered only as a short - hand notation for `` number of iterations '' .",
    "second it is apparent a the value @xmath48 seems to be the one with the slowest convergence ratio .",
    "this is probably due to the particular role played by the value @xmath48 as it will become clear shortly .",
    "figs.[fig4]-[fig8 ] depict typical patterns obtained on changing the parameter @xmath0 in the interval @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "the effect of the value of @xmath0 on the aggregation pattern is evident . as @xmath0 increases from @xmath81 to @xmath12 ,",
    "single big rivers draining the entire basin in a snake - like form are less and less favored .",
    "the pattern for @xmath82 has a strong memory of the original initial tree .",
    "the overall effect of the sc procedure is to disfavor long meandering of the streams thus providing a self - affine character to the final tree .",
    "the main river becomes rather straight for @xmath83 and the whole pattern appears to be more symmetric with respect to the case of @xmath82 .",
    "a noteworthy feature is that this tendency is inverted as @xmath84 and returns back for @xmath85 . as @xmath86 rivers become very directed as one would expect on the ground that this limit corresponds to the scheidegger network @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath48 most closely resembles real rivers is a reflection of the natural selection by the erosional processes of this value of @xmath0 in terms of eq .",
    "( [ sc2 ] ) as it has already been well documented in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in our numerical estimates of the exponents , for simplicity",

    "we also note that this is the region inaccessible to the analytical scheme of ref .",

    "@xmath33 it proves convenient to introduce the integrated probabilities : @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are related to @xmath28 and @xmath32 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ cr2 ] ) and ( [ cr3 ] ) , in an obvious way . an efficient way of computing the exponents is through the so - called `` effective '' ( sometime also referred to as `` running '' ) exponents . in the present case",

    "[ fig9 ] shows one typical result on a @xmath94 lattice . we can divide the obtained values roughly in four regions",
    "the first region ( @xmath95 ) corresponds to the region of no scaling .",
    "small rivers belonging to the second region ( @xmath96 ) have an exponent close to the absolute minimum value @xmath97 .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of typical rivers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) where small rivers display a marked straightness similar to the one of the absolute minimum @xcite and it means that they quickly assume configurations consistent with the absolute minimum ( independent of the initial conditions ) .",
    "larger areas are associated with larger rivers which have longer memory of the initial condition ( st in the present case ) .",
    "hence the corresponding exponent is sensibly smaller ( closer to the st value @xmath98 ) .",
    "the last region corresponds to the finite size cut - off and must be discarded .",
    "after discarding the first and forth regions the obtained values can then be grouped into local bins and a local average exponent can be associated with each of them .",
    "statistical fluctuations within each box then yield an estimate of error bars .",
    "this provides our best estimate of the exponent for each value of @xmath27 and a simple @xmath99 extrapolation is then carried out to extract the final values .",

    "an analogous procedure leads to the best estimates for @xmath33 as reported again in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "sizes and statistics are identical to those considered for the initial conditions and hence these simulations are rather time consuming .    one can notice a weak dependence on @xmath0 for both @xmath29 and @xmath33 .",
    "one way of computing @xmath30 and @xmath34 is through the collapse plots of the probabilities @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "however we have found that a satisfactory collapse can achieve only within a limited range of the appropriate variable ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) .",

    "we have first extended previous studies for both the sc solution of a langevin equation and the ocns variational methods .",
    "higher sizes and statistics have been exploited in both cases and , ( to our knowledge ) for the first time , the most physical procedure of basing the statistics only on the river with largest flow , has been implemented .",

    "small rivers very quickly settle to their final state whereas much longer time is required to large rivers to forget their initial conditions .",
    "this is also reflected by the difficulty in collapsing the distribution probabilities of both @xmath19 and @xmath20 into a single plot for a reasonably extended range of the corresponding variable .",
    "it is then possible that although only _ two _ universality classes ( one associated with the initial condition and the other to the absolute minimum ) are present , an intermediate universality class sets on due to both the averaging over different regimes and the difficulty of reaching the absolute minimum .    on the other hand , in support of the existence of a new universality class , we cite the fact that critical exponents are different from those of both st and sn  on starting with these initial conditions , critical exponents in the final configurations clearly deviate from their initial values . furthermore all exponents are found to be robust and obey to scaling relations summarized in sec.[sec : exp ] .",
    "overall we believe that the evidence suggested by our results favors this second possibility which has also been hinted into a different context @xcite . in this respect",
    "the weak @xmath0 dependence of critical exponents remains unexplained .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize the present calculation in two aspects .",
    "for the dynamical equation , it would be instructive to tackle the problem of the explicit solution of eq .",
    "( [ sc1 ] ) .",
    "this route has the advantage that eq .",
    "( [ sc2 ] ) ( the key relation between erosional process and network topology ) can be then _ derived _ rather than _ assumed _ as in the self - consistent procedure .",
    "similarly , a parallel calculation could also be implemented in the ocn framework , upon starting with the more general expression given in eq .",

    "<S> the existence and stability of the universality class associated to local minimal energy landscapes is investigated . using extensive numerical simulations , we first study the dependence on a parameter @xmath0 of a partial differential equation which was proposed to describe the evolution of a rugged landscape toward a local minimum of the dissipated energy . </S>",
