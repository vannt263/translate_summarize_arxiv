    "tombaugh 2 ( to2 ; at galactic coordinates [ @xmath16 = [ 232.8,@xmath96.9]@xmath17 ) is an old , distant open cluster in the outer galactic disc .",
    "we originally targeted this cluster as part of an ongoing program ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) to explore in depth a set of star clusters proposed by @xcite  on the basis of their position and kinematics  to be possibly associated with the monoceros stream ( mon ; newberg et al .",
    "2002 , ibata et al .",
    "2003 , yanny et al .",
    "2003 ) , also known as the galactic anticenter stellar structure ( gass ; rocha - pinto et al 2003 , crane et al .",
    "gass / mon was discovered as an overdensity of stars near the galactic plane that seems to wrap around the outer parts of the galactic disc and is frequently explained as tidal debris from the disruption of a dwarf galaxy on a low inclination orbit ( e.g. , crane et al .",
    "2003 , yanny et al .",
    "2003 , penarrubia et al .",
    "to2 has also been associated with the reputed dwarf galaxy in canis major ( cma ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is suggested to be a progenitor of the mon / gass structure ( martin et al .",
    "however , rocha - pinto et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argue that a more likely progenitor of mon / gass may lie somewhere in the region of the sky covered by the former constellation argo navis , and that the overdensity reported near cma is correlated to a window in the dust extinction there ; in this case , to2 would be farther displaced from the putative mon / gass progenitor . in any of these circumstances to2 is interesting as a potential member of a star cluster system accreted from another galaxy by the milky way .",
    "subsequently , our spectroscopic analysis of this cluster reveals to 2 to be interesting in its own right as the first known open cluster exhibiting possible evidence for multiple populations or an internal population spread , evidence we present and explore here no well studied open cluster has shown a spread in abundances of major elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* study of m67 ) .",
    "the possible association of to2 to mon is a characteristic shared with another unusual star cluster showing multiple populations , the globular cluster ngc 2808 ( crane et al .",
    "2003 , martin et al .",
    "cen ( as suggested by casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "2007 ) and has its own tidal stream , the derived ngc 2808 orbit remains consistent with the tilted spatial configuration found in outer disc star clusters ( frinchaboy et al .",
    "2004 ) . ] but whereas a few other globular clusters with multiple populations are now known ( see  6.2 ) , to date no multi - population open clusters have been reported . nevertheless , having two unusual , multi - population clusters potentially associated with the gass / mon / cma / argo structures is intriguing and may point to a mechanism for their creation ... if we can first establish that association _ and _ determine what gass / mon / cma / argo is .    the nature and/or reality of the proposed mon `` tidal debris stream '' and the cma overdensity have been called into question and are currently a matter of great debate .",
    "ibata et al . ( 2003 ) originally proposed that mon could be related to warps in the outer disc , while momany et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 ) have argued that much of the observed stellar overdensity associated with mon  and particularly all of that associated with cma ( at @xmath18 )  is due to the warping and flaring of the galactic disc , and that no `` extra - galactic '' component is needed to account for the apparent overdensities in the third quadrant .",
    "this conclusion has been contested by martin et al .",
    "( 2004b ) on the basis of radial velocities ( but cf .",
    "momany et al .",
    "2006 ) , while the discovery of `` blue plume '' stars in this part of the sky has been used to argue further for the presence of a dwarf galaxy nucleus in cma ( bellazzini et al .",
    "2004 , martinez - delgado et al .",
    "2005 , dinescu et al .",
    "2005 , butler et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , these young stars have also been more prosaically attributed to the presence of spiral arm structure ( carraro et al .",
    "2005 , moitinho et al .",
    "2006 ) . and",
    "grillmair ( 2006 ) has quite clearly identified tidal streams across the galactic anticenter region with relatively low inclination ( 35@xmath17 ) and at a similar distance and main sequence turnoff colour as mon , though he concludes on the basis of the best fit orbits that these streams have nothing to do with mon or cma .",
    "what is clear from all of the debate , and a commonly expressed sentiment by all sides , is that further study , particularly detailed spectroscopic analysis , is needed before the complicated nature of the outer disc , its warp , flare , spiral arm structure and possibly co - located tidal debris and halo substructure , can be confidently disentangled .",
    "thus , a number of studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are being conducted to explore further the kinematical and chemical properties of monoceros and the outer galactic disc .",
    "our own venture in this regard starts by focusing on high resolution spectroscopic investigation of old , open star clusters of the outer disc , including those hypothesized to be parts of the debated overdensities .",
    "in @xcite we present high resolution spectroscopy of the first five outer disc open clusters observed in our survey ( ruprecht  4 , ruprecht  7 , berkeley  25 , berkeley  73 and berkeley  75 ) and derive detailed abundance analyses and kinematics for these systems . here , we discuss separately the case of the open cluster to2 , which has surfaced as a potentially unusual system among the clusters of the outer disc .",
    "in this paper we obtain new estimates of the radial velocities (  3 ) and abundances ( [ fe / h ] and [ tii / fe ] ;  4 ) of stars in the to2 field .",
    "we discuss the unusual abundance results for to2 in  5 , and address the possible origins of the observed mixed chemistry , its implications for to2 and the outer disc , and the issue of the possible connection of to2 to the monoceros / gass structure in  6 .",
    "our spectroscopic data of to2 come from the eso - vlt ( proposal 076.b-0263 ) , and were collected with the flames@vlt+giraffe @xcite and flames@vlt+uves @xcite spectrographs on the nights of ut 1-dec-2005 and 5-dec-2005 .",
    "the sky was clear , and the typical seeing was 1.0 arcsec .",
    "flames allows the use of the giraffe spectrograph to obtain rvs for up to 132 stars at one time , while simultaneously using the uves multi - fiber mode , which allows observing up to eight additional sources . for uves",
    ", we used the 580 nm set - up ( @xmath19 in the 47506800   range ) .",
    "the eight fibers were placed on the brighter probable members of the cluster ( selected according to their position in the colour - magnitude diagram ; cmd ) , while flames+giraffe was used to target 35 additional probable members , with the remaining flames+giraffe fibers sampling the sky . in table [ rvs ] we report properties of the observed stars : the first and second column give their i d , the third and fourth the coordinates , the fifth and sixth the @xmath20 magnitude and @xmath21 colour , the seventh , eighth , and ninth columns the heliocentric radial velocity with the error and the membership classification ( see below ) , while the last three columns give the adopted atmospheric parameters used for abundance measurements for the member stars ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the data were reduced by eso personnel using the flames - uves reduction pipeline ( see http://www.eso.org/projects/dfs/dfs-shared/web/vlt/vlt-instrument-pipelines.html for documentation on the flames - uves pipeline and software ) which corrects the spectra for the detector bias and flat - field . then a wavelength calibration based on th - ar calibration - lamp spectra was applied .",
    "finally , each spectrum was flux - calibrated by applying the response - curve of the instrument , and the echelle orders were combined to obtain a single mono - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the resulting uves spectra have a dispersion of 0.1   pixel@xmath1 and a typical @xmath22 15 - 20 .",

    "these data were reduced similarly to the uves spectra , are at a dispersion of 0.25  pixel@xmath1 , and have @xmath22 6070 .",
    "the stars targeted with giraffe and uves were observed twice , so that two independent rv measurements were derived for each star from the collected spectra .",
    "radial velocities were measured using the iraf utility fxcor ; this routine cross - correlates the observed spectrum with a template having known radial velocity . as a template",
    ", we used a synthetic spectrum calculated for a typical solar metallicity giant star [ @xmath29 k , @xmath30 , @xmath31 km s@xmath1 ] .",
    "then each fxcor measured rv was converted to a heliocentric velocity using the iraf routine rvcorr .",
    "all of the measured rvs are presented in table [ rvs ] with their errors ; rvs for all observed stars are the weighted mean from the two measurements for each star , and these provide estimates of the errors by taken from fxcor .",
    "the derived radial velocities and metallicities , along with the available photometry of to2 stars @xcite , are used to revise the fundamental parameters of the cluster . cluster membership for the observed stars",
    "was determined on the basis of their radial velocity ( table [ rvs ] ) .",
    "the heliocentric velocities for all the observed stars ( @xmath33 ) are reported in table [ rvs ] , which provides ids from @xcite and @xcite , stellar coordinates , magnitudes and colours from @xcite . as shown in figure [ rvhist ] , we can easily identify cluster stars from their rv .",
    "stars with radial velocities of 121 @xmath34 4 km s@xmath1 are considered to be cluster members on the basis that : ( 1 ) examination of the rv distribution in figure [ rvhist ] clearly shows a peak associated with the cluster at 121 km s@xmath1 , ( 2 ) open cluster velocity dispersions are well - known to be very small , typically less than 0.51 km s@xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the @xmath34 4 km s@xmath1 acceptance window for members is more than generous for including suspected rv members , but still small enough to exclude most ( but possibly not all ) expected galactic contamination . from the distribution of rvs shown in figure 1",
    ", one might expect field star contamination across an 8 km s@xmath1 window at the level of no more than a few stars .",
    "moreover , from the besancon model @xcite we expect the mean velocity of milky way stars along the to2 line of sight to be about 57 km s@xmath1 , with a dispersion of 38 km s@xmath1 ; which suggests , given our sampling , a contamination rate of 0.02 stars ( @xmath35% ) with rvs of 117125 km s@xmath1 within the observed field of view .    analyzing the rv membership sample ( shown within the dotted lines in figure [ rv1 ] ) using techniques from @xcite , we derive a systemic rv for to2 of @xmath36 = 121.04 @xmath34 0.43 km s@xmath1 and a total velocity dispersion of @xmath37 = 1.81 @xmath34 0.30 km s@xmath1 .",

    "cluster membership and the to2 velocity dispersion is addressed further in  [ revise ] .",

    "we derived equivalent widths of unblended spectral lines by using a semi - automatic supermongo program written by one of the authors .",
    "repeated measurements show a typical error of about 5 - 10m  for the weakest lines because of the relatively low @xmath38 of the spectra ( uves : @xmath39 , giraffe : 6070 ) compared to those typically used in chemical abundance studies .",
    "the line list was taken from @xcite for uves spectra , and from the valdvald/ ] ( vienna atomic line database ; kupka et al .",

    "while this study was intended to verify or refute the connection of to2 with the monoceros stream / galactic anticenter stellar structure ( gass ) , our work has produced more questions than answers . the observed spread in to2 metallicity and @xmath5-abundances was not expected and can not be simply explained . to date , no other open cluster is known to have a metallicity spread , and it is difficult to understand how a low - mass open cluster might have been able to retain gas after an initial starburst to self - enrich .",
    "next , we review our findings and possible scenarios that could explain the data      first , we ask the question of whether both the mp and mr groups among the to2 rv members are likely to be truly part of the cluster , and then investigate the likelihood that either population is simply contamination of the rv member sample .",
    "to2 has been proposed to be part of the putative gass cluster system @xcite , and the mp population is similar , though slightly more metal rich than , other studied monoceros candidate clusters such as saurer 1 @xcite , berkeley 29 @xcite , and palomar 1 @xcite .",
    "these clusters all have ages of approximately 46 gyr , metallicities between @xmath90.7 and @xmath90.4 dex , and are all @xmath5enhanced .",
    "our to2 mp group is younger though similarly moderately metal poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath8 @xmath90.3 ) and also @xmath5enhanced .",
    "this is at least circumstantial evidence that the mp group might be the more likely member population .",
    "this subgroup also has a metallicity roughly consistent with previous metallicity determinations for to2 by @xcite and @xcite  though it is not impossible that these other researchers could have also been hit with a spate of bad luck in terms of misleading target selection .",
    "on the other hand , it must also be admitted that the mp group both exhibits more scatter in terms of metallicity properties than the mr population and has a smaller number of members  though this number increases when we account for the additional `` mp '' members found in the @xcite and @xcite samples that are not part of our sample .",
    "perhaps the strongest support for the supposition that the mp group is a `` real '' part of the cluster comes from the fact that the mp group is strongly centrally concentrated ( figs . 4 and 5 ) and that it has a marginally smaller velocity dispersion than the mr group , as shown in table [ compare ] .",
    "the mr population is indeed less centrally concentrated that the mp population , and in fact has a distribution function not unlike our spectroscopic sampling function , as shown in figure [ xyplot ] and [ intgplot ] . given the small number statistics overall , it may not be impossible for us to have been successful at achieving a uniform `` success '' fraction ( i.e. in identifying rv members ) over the radial range sampled , even by chance .",
    "indeed , the overall distribution of rv members very closely tracks the sampling function .",
    "though figure [ xyplot ] clearly shows a tighter mp distribution than mr population , it is not inconceivable for there to exist a metallicity gradient in the system to yield a differential radial distribution  on the other hand , the one needed ( i.e. more metal poor towards the centre ) is quite unusual and not seen elsewhere .",
    "on the other hand , the mr group has more members and is more tightly clumped in [ fe / h ] . given the tight rv distribution , chemical properties , and sheer numbers it seems difficult to believe that the mr population is not some coherent simple stellar population ( ssp ) , whether part of the cluster or a `` contaminant . ''",
    "we show below that this population is quite unlike that of the disc field star population ( which is not an ssp ) .    if the true to2 stars are those in the mr group ( and excluding the mp group ) then to2 is less consistent with being part of the putative gass cluster system , as it would be inconsistent with the observed metallicity distribution of monoceros ( crane et al 2003 ; sbordone et al 2005 ; de jong et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this case , to2 would be the most distant metal - rich milky way disk open cluster found to date .",
    "it seems unlikely that a 2 gyr old cluster with near solar [ fe / h ] could have formed `` normally '' in the outer disc , given the observed , more depleted chemistry of the surrounding disc stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this would suggest that the cluster must have formed elsewhere ( e.g. , in a dwarf galaxy ) and been deposited in the outer disc .",
    "this is not out of line with current cdm models for the formation of milky way - like galaxies , which suggest that discs form from the outside via continued merging ( e.g. , abadi et al 2003 ) .",
    "stars as metal rich as our mr group are indeed found in paradigm accretion events , like the sagittarius dwarf ( e.g. , smecker - hane & mcwilliam 2002 , monaco et al .",
    "2005 , chou et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "if we believe that only one of the two metallicity populations is truly part of to2 , then the other population must be a contaminant of some kind . here we address how likely it is that either population may be part of the galactic disc .",
    "we have already seen (  [ model ] ) that the predicted contamination rate of normal disc stars into our rv membership range based on the besancon model ( see  [ model ] ) is already smaller ( by factor of 10@xmath47 ) than either our mp or mr samples  thus , it seems very unlikely that either population can be a statistical , `` fluke '' superposition of a large number of disc stars with just the right rv . from poisson statistics ,",
    "the chances that we would get 7 ( e.g. , mp ) or 11 ( e.g. , mr ) stars as contaminants when the models predict 0.02 stars is @xmath48 % and @xmath49 % , respectively . and",
    "this ignores the fact that other studies have identified additional stars in the to2 that we would categorize as `` mp . ''",
    "based on the radial distribution of members , the mp population seems more likely to be truly part of the cluster .",
    "this could then imply that the mr group is a contaminant population",
    ". however , stars this metal rich ( nearly solar metallicity ) at @xmath15 kpc are not consistent with the measured metallicities of red giants in the outer disc @xcite as well as outer disc cepheid stars @xcite , which both suggest that the median disc metallicity at this galactocentric distance should be [ fe / h ] @xmath8 -0.4 .",
    "these studies of outer disc tracers find no stars as metal rich as our mr group , even for the younger cepheid populations .",
    "this then might suggest that the mp group could be a contaminating field population , since the chemistry of this group is more in line with that of the @xcite and @xcite stars in the outer disc . in turn , this implies that the tight radial concentration of the mp stars is a statistical anomaly .",
    "however monte carlo simulations show that the probability for a random disc population to achieve the observed level of concentration , taking into account our sampling function , is 0.1% .",
    "it also implies that previous spectroscopic studies had similarly `` bad luck '' in picking targets to represent to2 .      the cumulative evidence for to2  the nearly identical velocities and velocity dispersions of the stars when divided into mp and mr groups , the positions of the stars in the cmd , the unlikeliness that these stars are field contamination , etc .",
    " suggests that all of the rv `` members '' in our to2 spectroscopic sample could truly be members of the system .",
    "if all rv `` members '' are indeed members of to2 then we are finding evidence for a _ significant _ metallicity spread within to2 . that we also seem to find a similar bifurcation of [ tii / fe ] with [ fe / h ] , rather than a scatter - diagram in figure 3 is further evidence of a possible coherent chemical enrichment history .",
    "it is also possible , based on an apparent `` break '' in both [ fe / h ] _ and _ [ tii / fe ] , that the to2 chemical and age distribution suggests the possibility that there may be two populations rather than a `` trend . ''",
    "if these populations of varying chemistry do belong to to2 , what formation scenarios could create such a unique open cluster ?",
    "what is the possibility that two clusters with the same rv lie at nearly the same distance and have nearly the same metallicity and could also be aligned along the same line of sight ? though such a configuration could produce the observed results in the to2 field , and even account for the apparent `` bimodal '' behavior of the chemical distribution , it seems extremely unlikely given the small number of clusters ( less than 20 ) known this far from the galactic centre .",
    "it is the case that a superposition of clusters would increase the `` discoverability '' of this distant `` double cluster '' , but the individual clusters would have to be very close together along the line of sight given that a significant broadening of the main sequence is not seen in the available photometry .",
    "however new higher quality photometry would be needed to fully test this case ( as was done with the _ hubble space telescope _ in the case of ngc 2808 ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are a few cases of overlapping clusters , with the most - well studied overlapping pair being ngc 1750 and ngc 1758 , with ages of 200 @xmath34 50 and 400 @xmath34 100 myr respectively @xcite . for ngc 1750 and ngc 1758 proper motions",
    "were required to be able to separate the two clusters separated by @xmath50 pc along the line of sight @xcite , but with little noticeable differences seen in the overlapping cmd sequences @xcite .",
    "these clusters are the oldest pair of confirmed overlapping clusters , and , given the age and distance differences , @xcite conclude that the clusters do not constitute a binary system .",
    "however for to2 , the fact that mean velocity derived from high - resolution rvs is the same , and different than the galactic disc trend , makes the possibility of it being part of a `` double cluster '' remote .",
    "another explanation for our results in the to2 field might be that two clusters with nearly the same age and different metallicities could have have collided and merged . given that open clusters rotate with the galactic disc , the small relative velocity difference between two clusters with similar orbits makes prolonged near encounters between close clusters possible .",
    "additionally , the relatively large velocity dispersion of to2 , @xmath51 km s@xmath1 ( e.g. , m67 has @xmath520.96 km s@xmath1 ; girard et al .",
    "1989 ; frinchaboy & majewski 2007 ) might suggest that the cluster could have been dynamically heated at some point , possibly by a merger of clusters .",
    "a simple calculation based on merging of two equal - mass eliptical galaxies @xcite , shows that for a two - body encounter with two equally massed clusters ( assuming each is @xmath53 m@xmath54 ) finds that mergers are possible if two clusters pass within less than 2 pc given a differential velocity of 5 km s@xmath1 .",
    "however as pointed out in the argument above , given the small number of distant clusters the chances of such an occurrence are very small ; nevertheless , the merging of two clusters can not be ruled out as a possible explanation for the observed chemical peculiarities .      the cumulative evidence for to2  the nearly identical velocities and velocity dispersions of the stars when divided into mp and mr groups , the positions of the stars in the cmd , the unlikeliness that these stars are field contamination , etc .",
    " suggests that all of the rv `` members '' in our to2 spectroscopic sample could truly be members of the system .",
    "if all rv `` members '' are indeed members of to2 then we are finding evidence for a _ significant _ metallicity spread within to2 . that we also seem to find a similar bifurcation of [ tii / fe ] with [ fe / h ] , rather than a scatter - diagram in figure 3 is further evidence of a possible coherent chemical enrichment history .",
    "it is also possible , based on an apparent `` break '' in both [ fe / h ] _ and _ [ tii / fe ] , that the to2 chemical and age distribution suggests the possibility that there may be two populations rather than a `` trend . ''",
    "no other open cluster has been found to have an internal metallicity spread . on the other hand ,",
    "a small number of _ globular _ clusters have been found with metallicity spreads ( e.g. , @xmath55 cen ; norris , freeman , & mighell 1996 ; majewski et al .",
    "2000 ; carraro & lia 2000 ; frinchaboy et al .",
    "2002 ; villanova et al .",
    "2007 ) , multiple internal populations ( ngc 1851 and ngc 2808 ; milone et al . 2007 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or to represent one of a series of populations in a more complex structure ( m54 in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ; sgr dsph ; siegel et al .",
    "interestingly , such unusual clusters typically have been associated with the possibility of tidal accretion events .",
    "could to2 be the remains of something that was once larger  a globular cluster or dwarf galaxy ?",
    "this seems like the only way that to2 could have had two episodes of star formation , since the mass of a typical open cluster is generally much too small to retain and self - enrich gas after an initial star burst .",
    "the mass of a long - lived open cluster is typically a few @xmath56@xmath53 m@xmath54 ( e.g. , m67 has a current mass @xmath57 ; * ? ? ?",
    "a mass of at least @xmath58 m@xmath54 would be needed for to2 to have retained enough gas to have a second epoch of star formation ( e.g. , the current mass of @xmath55 cen is @xmath59 ; dsouza & rix 2005 ) .",
    "thus , this would require to 2 either to have had a significant dark matter content , which is ruled out by the velocity dispersion ( and in any case would have made to 2 unique among star clusters , open or globular ) , or to have been initially much larger and then stripped down to its current size .",
    "fortunately for this scenario , the disc is a dynamically brutal environment for clusters and dwarf galaxies , which are expected to undergo vigorous stripping .",
    "indeed , this is the prevailing scenario to explain the presently visible multiple populations in the @xmath55 cen `` globular cluster '' system .",
    "the two apparent sub - populations in to2 do seem to show a chemical trend evoking self - enrichment , with the metal - poor , @xmath5-enhanced population formed first , followed by formation of a more metal - rich , non-@xmath5-enhanced population .",
    "the above `` evolution '' is what is expected from closed - box chemical evolution models .",
    "unfortunately , two other observational facts contradict the self enrichment scenario : ( 1 ) the derived isochrone ages for the two populations are the same , within the errors of the fitting , which are @xmath34 0.5 gyr .",
    "( 2 ) it is typical in self - enrichment scenarios for the more metal rich population , formed in the bottom of the potential well more recently , to be more centrally concentrated . thus , if to2 was the tidal remnant of a larger stellar system one would expect that the `` younger '' metal - rich population would be more centrally concentrated , as is found in the case of @xmath55 cen ( pancino et al . 2000 ) and dsph galaxies ( e.g. , sculptor ; tolstoy et al 2004 ) .",
    "however given the available data , we find that the metal - poor stars are more centrally concentrated , in marked contrast to large systems undergoing tidal stripping ( tolstoy et al 2004 ) .      we have seen how a self - enrichment scenario seems to be contradicted by the relative radial and age distributions of the mp and mr populations .",
    "and we have seen that it is unlikely that to2 represents either dynamically or apparently merged / overlapped systems . yet",
    "the strongly matched velocities and velocity dispersions of the two systems suggests a dynamical connection of the two populations , and there is at least some metallicity and velocity mismatch of these populations with the surrounding disc stars .",
    "there remains one possible scenario that could account for most of the observed properties in the to2 field , and which has a known prototype : the sgr dsph stream and its cluster system .",
    "any small spectroscopic survey of a sgr star cluster , particularly one of those sgr clusters near the core of the dsph ( e.g. , terzan 7 , terzan 8 or arp 2 ) , would produce a number of the same phenomena we observe in our small spectroscopic survey of the to2 field : a centrally concentrated , older core of more metal - poor stars that are part of the star cluster , seen against a more broadly distributed , typically younger and more metal rich population of stars , generally unbound , tidally stripped from the parent dsph galaxy , and all with the same radial velocity .",
    "this could be an analogous situation to what we observe in the field of to2 , with the primary difference being that we are explaining the properties of an open , not globular , cluster .",
    "thus , we hypothesize this as the leading explanation for what we are finding in the to2 field : we propose that the mp population represents the true cluster , as most strongly supported by the radial concentration of these stars , and that the mr population represents stars that are part of a distinct parent system , probably a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy , that are spread more uniformly across our survey field ( and beyond ) .",
    "such a scenario is consistent with prevailing models of disc formation , which indeed suggest that discs continually grow by accreting `` subhalos '' around the edge ( e.g. , abadi et al 2003 , brook et al .",
    "it also accounts for how we can have two populations with identical rvs , but differing metallicities , and with the more metal - rich population being more extended .",
    "that to2 has been already hypothesized to be a part of the gass / monoceros `` tidal stream '' @xcite provides additional support for this proposed scenario , although the velocity dispersion of gass / mon is much larger than our mr population ( crane et al .",
    "2003 , martin et al 2006 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that other tidal streams could exist and have contributed star clusters to the outer disc .      while we have discussed a number of possible explanations for our unusual findings in our survey of the to2 field , the only hypothesis that seems to explain most of the results in a natural way is that to2 is represented by our mp population and that the mr population represents stars from a parent dwarf galaxy that is contributing to2 to our galactic disc .",
    "all other hypotheses  self - enrichment , a merger of two clusters , a superposition of two clusters  have serious problems or are very improbable .",
    "it is also yet unclear whether to2 may be part of the proposed gass / mon system .",
    "surely it is worth mentioning that if to2 actually has two different populations , then it is truly an unusual object .",
    "the one clear finding from this work is that further work is needed on the outer galactic cluster system , in particular to2",
    ". a much larger spectroscopic sample that includes both high precision velocities and detailed abundances would be especially useful .",
    "moreover , the properties of outer disc stars are needed to better constrain the existence , characteristics and origin of the gass / monoceros system and other tidally accreted systems in the outer galactic disc .",
    "while rvs and abundances may not provide an explicit separation of an accreted satellite from the outer disc , it is nonetheless essential that the kinematical and more importantly abundance trends in the outer disc are known . without clear knowledge of the abundance patterns with radius , especially at large distances and in the second and third galactic quadrants",
    ", one can not explicitly use abundances to distinguish whether the gass / monoceros stream is distinct from the outer galactic disc .",
    "the present paper is one among many efforts that aim to correct the deficiency of abundance information known for the outer milky way disc .",
