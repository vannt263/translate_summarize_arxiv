    "in this contribution we describe various aspects related to modulational , benjamin - feir , instability that have been found in a detailed study of a family of wavefields .",
    "these aspects give rise to some understanding of phenomena that are observable in the downstream evolution of unidirectional waves , showing the spatial evolution from a slightly modulated uniform wave train to a position where large amplitude amplification occurs and extreme waves arise .",
    "although these findings are for a special class of solutions in a simplified model , it is expected that at least some of the phenomena and underlying physics could be quite characteristic for more general situations in which extreme ( ` rogue ' ) waves are observed .",
    "this is to be expected , since the family of wavefields studied are the deterministic description of the fully nonlinear evolution of the initially linear benjamin - feir instability with one pair of unstable sidebands .",
    "this family is known in the nls model as the soliton on finite background ( sfb ) , given in @xcite .",
    "some of the results reported in detail in andonowati e.a . , @xcite , will be put in a broader perspective and , where possible , a link with research on stochastic elements will be made .",
    "in fact , different from the statistical approach that envisages the occurrence of extreme waves as a very rare occasion for which it is not yet known if there are special circumstances that give rise to their occurrence , we start from the opposite direction : what are the basic underlying physical properties of extreme waves ( as they appear in this family ) , and extract information from this that may be characteristic for more realistic cases too .",
    "slowly varying evolutions of a monochromatic wave with wavenumber and frequency @xmath0  satisfying the dispersion relation , are described in first order of the ( small ) wave elevations with a complex valued amplitude @xmath1  like @xmath2   + cc\\ ] ] to study the spatial evolution , it is practical to describe the amplitude in variables with delayed time , with the delay determined by the corresponding group velocity @xmath3 , so @xmath4 , where @xmath5  are the ( scaled ) physical laboratory variables ( we suppress the first order and second order scaling coefficients in @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , just as we do in the amplitude ) . to incorporate dispersive and nonlinear effects in comparable order , @xmath1 should satisfy in the lowest nontrivial approximation the nls equation , given by @xmath8\\ ] ] where @xmath9 are constants , depending on the monochromatic wave . for sufficiently large wavenumbers , both parameters have the same sign ( positive say , without restriction since the sign of @xmath7 can be changed )",
    ". then dispersive effects ( broadening of linear wavegroups ) can be balanced by focussing effects from nonlinearity ; in this paper we consider only this case , the ` deep water limit ' .",
    "in section 2 we present the basic observations of the family of sfb ; higher order families with @xmath10 pairs of sidebands also exist , sfb@xmath11",
    ". the case @xmath12 shows phenomena like the interaction of two sfb@xmath13 solutions , somewhat similar to interaction in nls of two confined soliton wave groups . ] .",
    "we first present a description of the complete spatial evolution , using the envelope of the waves to illustrate the development of wavegroups , and the maximal temporal amplitude to depict the largest possible surface elevations at each point .",
    "we investigate the time signal , and its spectral properties , at the extreme position where the largest waves appear and describe how , as a consequence of the appearance of phase singularities , waves in one wavegroup are distinguished between extreme and intermittent waves that have opposite phase . near the extreme position ,",
    "the motion of the extreme waves is studied , showing the familiar nonlinear modification of the dispersion relation in the physical solution , and changes in the quadratic energy spectrum in second and higher order only . in section 3",
    "we investigate what can be said about the maximal possible amplitude for signals obeying certain constraints .",
    "in particular we consider as constraints the simplest motion invariants of energy and momentum ( constants during the down stream evolution ) , and show that the extreme signal has as remarkable property that it is a solution of a specific optimization principle .",
    "remarks and conclusions about the relevance of the results obtained in this paper for more realistic situations will finish the paper .",
    "this section is based to a considerable extent on the results presented in @xcite ; see this paper also for additional references .",
    "after some preliminaries , a global description of downstream running nonlinearly distorted waves according to sfb is presented , the extremal signal is studied , and the detailed dynamics near the extreme position is investigated .",
    "the explicit expression for the solution of the nls equation called soliton on finite background is given in @xcite ; we use the notation of @xcite .",
    "the solution is given for the complex amplitude @xmath14:@xmath15 this describes actually a family of sfb solutions which depend on two essential parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; two other parameters are related to a shift in time and position : we will choose these such that the extreme wave will appear for normalized variables at @xmath18 , with maximal height at @xmath19 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 denotes ( half of ) the amplitude of the uniform wavetrain at infinity , while @xmath20 is a normalization of the modulation frequency @xmath17  of the given carrier frequency .",
    "in fact , with the notation from @xcite , we have @xmath21 .",
    "compared to the definition of benjamin - feir index @xmath22  in @xcite , adapted for the case considered here , we have the relation @xmath23 so that benjamin - feir instability takes place for @xmath24 , corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 happens to be the benjamin - feir growth factor of linear instability theory .    in the following",
    "we will use the notation sfb to denote the solution in physical variables , describing the surface elevation @xmath27  of the physical waves without the second order stokes effect .",
    "these second order effects can be added ; they will contribute to the actual wave heights , and show modulations ( with double modulation frequency ) on the mta described below , but will not essentially contribute to the basic phenomenon .",
    "the role of the second order effects in generating four wave interaction and resonance phenomenon is already accounted for ( in the considered order of accuracy ) by the nls equation .",
    "another important consequence of this is that in the following we deal mainly with the wave amplitudes which directly determine the waveheight as twice the amplitude .    in the following",
    "we will consider the spatial nls - equation , in which case the sfb will be periodic in time , and soliton - like in the spatial direction , describing the spatial evolution of downstream running time - modulated waves .",
    "for the deterministic sfb wavefield the significant waveheight @xmath28 , a quantity that is fundamental in the statistical description of wave fields can not well be defined . yet , since the space asymptotic of the wave field is a uniform wavetrain , when considering the averaged amplitude of the one - third highest waves , the only consistent similar quantity would be the value @xmath29 . adopting then the ( seemingly arbitrary , but often used ) definition of ` rogue ' wave as waves of wave height larger",
    "then @xmath30 , this will give a rough idea in which cases in the following we are dealing with extreme waves .",
    "1 shows a plot of a snapshot of the spatial wavefield of waves running from left to right . at the left the slightly modulated uniform wave train ( amplitude @xmath29 )",
    "this modulation clearly determines a characteristic modulation length that is maintained during the complete downstream evolution .",
    "while moving to the right , the modulations are amplified , creating distinct wave groups . at a certain position , called the _ extreme position _ ( in scaled variables taken to be at @xmath18 ) , the largest wave appears , after which the reverse process sets in the decay towards the asymptotic harmonic wave train ( with some phase change ) .",
    "note that near the extreme position , the extreme wave is locally surrounded by waves of much smaller amplitude , as if the total energy in one wavegroup is conserved but with the energy redistributed between waves . in time , both the waves and the envelope shifts to the right at different speed ( the phase and group velocity respectively ) . also shown in the plot",
    "is the so - called mta , the _ maximal temporal amplitude _ : this is the ( time - independent ) curve determined by the maximal wave height at each point , the steady envelope of the wavegroups . among other things , the mta shows the global amplification factor , the ratio of the maximal and the asymptotic amplitude ; this ratio is maximal 3 , depending on @xmath20 , but the local amplification factor near the extreme position can actually be much larger .    as is visible in fig.1 , the waves as they are running downstream , undergo increasingly large oscillations in amplitude . at a fixed position",
    "the maximal amplitude is given by the value of mta , which is reached once every time period @xmath31 . in between these successive maxima ,",
    "the amplitude may be monotone , or ( for sufficiently small values of @xmath20 ) , non - monotone as is shown near the extreme position .",
    "the _ extreme signal _ , the time signal at the extreme position , has various special properties ; we will denote the envelope by @xmath32 .",
    "first , this extreme signal is real , and its envelope is strictly positive for @xmath33 , while for @xmath34 the envelope changes sign ; here @xmath35 . at times when the envelope vanishes , the phase experiences a @xmath36-jump , causing phase singularities . in any case",
    "we observe that at the extreme position all modes that make up the time signal are strongly phase correlated : either all having the same phase or some having opposite phase .",
    "more particularly , it was shown in @xcite that the envelope @xmath37  satisfies a newton - type of equation and allows a simple phase - plane representation . explicitly ,",
    "the equation reads@xmath38 where @xmath39 are positive constants ( depending on @xmath20 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "we will show in the next section that this is related to an optimization property .    for a characteristic value of @xmath40 ,",
    "the time signal is plotted in fig.2 .",
    "we see that in one modulation period the wavegroup has been split in extreme waves and a number of intermittent waves of much smaller amplitude .",
    "the separation at times of a phase singularity , causes the intermittent and extreme waves to have opposite phase .",
    "in the spatial plot this shows itself in wave annihilation and wave creation at the successive singularities ( see @xcite for more details ) .    at the critical value",
    "@xmath41  for which the envelope vanishes at one point and is positive at the other times in the modulation period , the global amplification factor is precisely @xmath42 . to satisfy the ` rogue wave ' definition of amplification larger than @xmath43 the value of @xmath20  has to be smaller , i.e. will always correspond to the case when phase singularities are present ; for instance , for @xmath44 , the amplification is @xmath45 .",
    "the spectral description of the time signal at a fixed position is for the asymptotic modulated wavetrain according to benjamin - feir instability : the major part of the energy in the central frequency and small contributions in one pair of sidebands .",
    "as is to be expected form the change of the spatial envelope , an increase of the number of relevant sidebands and large energy exchange between the modes takes place while approaching the extremal position ; depending on the value of @xmath20  the energy of the central frequency may have been transferred to neighbouring sidebands , for @xmath46 even completely .",
    "actually , the appearance in the extreme signal of the phase singularities , and the corresponding partitioning of the waves within one modulation period in extreme and intermittent waves , causes that large differences in the spectrum are observed while practically the same envelope for the extreme waves is obtained .",
    "the intermittent waves ` modulate ' the spectral properties of the extreme waves .",
    "this can be seen by writing the envelope @xmath47  in one period @xmath48 $ ]  as the sum of an envelope @xmath49 of the extreme waves , and an envelope @xmath50  of the intermittent waves centered at @xmath51 .",
    "then the spectral fourier components of the complete envelope @xmath52 , the minus - sign to indicate the @xmath36-phase difference between the waves , are given by @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the spectral components of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the @xmath57-th sideband respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath58 is a consequence of the timeshift and has the modulational effect of decreasing and increasing the contributions in successive sidebands , starting with a decrease of the energy at the center frequency . in case",
    "the intermittent waves are such that @xmath59 this indicates that the presence of the intermittent waves makes it possible that the same maximal amplitude can be obtained for less energy . in fig .",
    "3 the spectra of the extreme signal are shown for three values of @xmath20 .",
    "[ ptb ]    the observation described here may be a warning when interpreting spectra for extreme waves , and just as well when looking for conditions on spectra to describe extreme waves . when background waves are present ( the intermittent waves in the extreme signal may be considered like that ) , they will greatly disturb the spectrum related to the extreme waves and can increase the maximal possible amplitude at given energy .",
    "we investigate the evolution of the signal and its spectral components in space near the extreme position .",
    "we show that the first order change in phase is described by a nonlinear modification of the dispersion relation with an additional quadratic term and a term of fornberg - whitham type .",
    "the change of the envelope , and of the quadratic spectrum , is shown to be of higher order .",
    "the change of the amplitude near the extreme position is found from a direct taylor expansion @xmath60   _ { \\xi=0}+\\frac{\\xi^{2}}{2}\\left [   \\partial_{\\xi}% ^{2}a\\right ]   _ { \\xi=0}+ ... $ ] . using the evolution equation and the equation for @xmath37 one",
    "gets @xmath61   + o\\left (   \\xi^{3}\\right )   .\\ ] ] in the plane of the complex amplitude @xmath1 , the evolution in time at @xmath62  is on the real axis , crossing the origin if there is a phase singularity . for small @xmath7 the solution above",
    "can be described as @xmath63 which has the geometric interpretation of two successive actions : the solution at @xmath64 that lies on the real axis is rotated around the origin over an angle @xmath65 and then followed by a shift along the imaginary axis over a distance @xmath66 .    for the absolute value of the nls solution",
    "we find up to third order @xmath67 + o\\left (   \\xi^{3}\\right )   , \\ ] ] while , writing @xmath68 ,  the first order change of the phase @xmath69 at @xmath64 is @xmath70 indicating once again the singular behaviour at the times of phase singularity where @xmath37 vanishes .",
    "for the phase of the physical solution , @xmath71 , this leads to @xmath72 invoking the governing equation for @xmath37 , the result for the local wavenumber can be written like @xmath73 this can be interpreted as a nonlinear modification of the linear dispersion relation with a quadratic contribution and a homogeneous term of fornberg - withham type .",
    "for the fourier transformation with respect to time , we denote the spectral components of @xmath74 by @xmath75 according to @xmath76 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath37 is real we find @xmath77   + o\\left (   \\xi^{3}\\right )   .\\ ] ] here @xmath78 is a contribution to the central frequency @xmath79  only , while @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote convolution of second and third order respectively . for the absolute value",
    "we find up to third order @xmath82   + o\\left (   \\xi^{3}\\right )   .\\ ] ] to relate this with the change of the physical quadratic spectrum , we get for the quadratic spectrum using @xmath83   + cc:$]@xmath84   + o\\left (   x^{3}\\right )   .\\ ] ] writing @xmath85 we find at @xmath64  for the phase change of the spectral components of the amplitude @xmath86 . for the phase of the physical solution @xmath87 this modifies the change due to linear dispersion:@xmath88 which is the spectral version of the nonlinearly modified dispersion relation .",
    "this section addresses some aspects centered around the question when a wavefield ( or envelope ) attains its maximal value , depending on the constraints that are imposed",
    ". we will denote this symbolically for a signal @xmath89 like @xmath90 in particular , the effect of prescribing the quadratic spectrum is considered first .",
    "then we consider the case of relevance for the evolution of waves , when we take as constraints motion invariants ( integral quantities ) , and describe that the extreme signal of the sfb solutions of the previous section arises as special signal when the constraints are optimally chosen .      here",
    "we consider real functions of given period @xmath91 and @xmath92 , or look at signals with continuous spectrum ( using the notation of the latter ) .",
    "any signal with given quadratic spectrum @xmath93  is of the form@xmath94 for some phase function @xmath95 .",
    "a completely focussed signal would have all phases the same , say zero , @xmath96 and produces the signal that for the given quadratic spectrum has the largest amplitude ( at @xmath19 ) , and@xmath97 if we relax the constraints , the results critically depend on the constraints . for instance , if not the spectrum , but only the value of the integrated quadratic spectrum is prescribed , the related maximization problem has no finite solution . in fourier language",
    "this is related to the fact that the energy is equally partitioned over all sidebands : equipartition of energy .",
    "we indicated in the previous section that intermittent waves can partly contribute to a better equipartition .",
    "if stronger norms that the integrated quadratic spectrum are prescribed , finite solutions will exist .",
    "most relevant seems to consider the maximization problem with constraints that are motivated by physics . to that end",
    "we introduce the following functionals that are related respectively to the approximation of the physical energy @xmath98 , the physical momentum @xmath99 and the ` mass ' functional @xmath100 defined by @xmath101   dt,\\,\\,i\\left ( s\\right )   = \\int_{0}^{t}\\frac{1}{2}s^{2}dt,\\,\\,m\\left (   s\\right ) = \\int_{0}^{t}s\\,dt,\\ ] ] and we investigate the optimization problem@xmath102 the resulting equation for ( [ maxa_hgm ] ) follows with lagrange multiplier rule:@xmath103 where we write the variational derivative of a functional @xmath104  like @xmath105 ( when equated to zero , @xmath106 , this is precisely the euler - lagrange equation of the functional @xmath104 ) .",
    "the multipliers are related to the values of the constraints ; when the rhs does nt vanish , the multiplier @xmath107 can be taken equal to one without restriction . explicitly , the equation reads@xmath108   + \\lambda_{2}s+\\lambda_{3}%\\ ] ] where @xmath109  is the time at which @xmath110 attains its maximum , and @xmath111 denotes dirac s delta function . when the rhs vanishes , which is consistent with @xmath112 , we recover the equation for the extremal signal of sfb described above .",
    "this is only the case if the constraint values @xmath113  are chosen correctly ; we show in the next subsection that this holds for the extremal signal .    for non - optimal constraint values , the multipliers will be different and @xmath114 . then formally the extremal signal can still be found explicitly but will not be a realistic physical signal since it contains a discontinuity in the derivative at the time of maximal amplitude as a consequence of the delta - function ; the optimal solution is then obtained by pasting continuously together parts of a suitable extreme time signal . although the signal itself may be non - physical , its value of the maximal amplitude provides an upperbound for any other signal satisfying the constraints .      as stated above , among signals",
    "that satisfy constrained values of the functionals @xmath115 the ones with maximal amplitude will be obtained when the constraints are such that these three functionals are linearly related ( when @xmath112 ) .",
    "we will now show that the extremal signals have this property .",
    "indeed , for suitable parameters @xmath116 related to the constraint values @xmath117 , the extreme signal will be a solution of the constrained optimization problem for the physical energy @xmath118    indeed , an extremizer of this optimization problem satisfies the lagrange multiplier formulation @xmath119 for some multipliers @xmath120 . written in",
    "full for the specific functionals , this is precisely the newton equation ( [ esignal ] )  for the extreme signal .",
    "actually , using the fact that @xmath98 and @xmath99 are restrictions to real - valued amplitudes of motion invariants for the complex amplitude of nls , these values in ( [ minh_gm_real ] ) are immediately found from the asymptotic values at the uniform wavetrain ; we will describe this in more detail in a forth coming paper @xcite .",
    "we have studied a special class of wavefields and extracted several properties that may be useful for the understanding of the appearance of extreme waves in more realistic situations .",
    "although the wavefields are derived from the simple nls - model and no rigorous mathematical proof of their validity can be given , at least it can be said that these wavefields seem to be realizable in practice , as was shown by actual experiments performed in large wavetanks at marin , see the contribution of huijsmans e.a .",
    "@xcite in these proceedings .",
    "the experimental verification is vital , in particular because most simplified models ( and certainly nls as has been used here ) do not predict breaking phenomena . when breaking occurs , the deterministic predictions become useless , while if no breaking occurs it can be expected that the predictions have qualitative , and as has been shown in the experiments , also quite good quantitative , validity .",
    "it is also appropriate to discuss the validity , the ` robustness ' , of the basic phenomena described here for extension to more realistic situations .",
    "in particular this concerns the optimization property of the extreme signal : can we expect such a property to hold in more realistic situations , without relying on any conviction that also in those cases `` ...... la nature agit selon quelque principe dun maximum ou minimum . ''",
    "( euler , 1746 ) .",
    "the optimization principle involves three functionals .",
    "two of them have a clear physical meaning , although for nls the complexified versions have to be considered .",
    "these are @xmath98 , which is when complexified the hamiltonian of nls and is an approximation of the energy , and the quadratic functional @xmath99  which in complex form is also an nls invariant that can be interpreted for the real wavefields as the momentum .",
    "these functionals will also be present as invariants for reliable models that are more accurate than the nls model , since the energy and momentum expressions are ( approximations of ) motion invariants for the full surface wave equations under the assumptions of non viscous fluid and translation symmetry .",
    "it can therefore be anticipated , or at least it can be hoped , that these two functionals will be relevant in any optimization principle  for realistic large waves at the extreme position .",
    "the major questionable point in the idea to generalize ( [ minh_gm_real ] ) is the role of the so - called ` mass ' functional @xmath100 that does not seem to correspond to a physically well understood invariant functional in more general situations . from its definition , @xmath121 is seen to be precisely the square root of the energy in the central frequency , @xmath122 .",
    "it will be shown in @xcite that this ` mass ' turns up as a special case , valid only at the extreme position , in a variational principle that describes the complete sfb evolution as a relative equilibrium according to general hamiltonian theory .",
    "that variational formulation depends on ( the existence of ) a higher order invariant functional , and this seems to be related to the special properties of the completely integrable nls equation considered here .",
    "so the results presented here do not unambiguously support the idea that the optimization principle for the extreme signal can be expected to hold also in more realistic cases . yet",
    "it is tempting to look for such extremal formulations also in more realistic cases .    it may even be possible to investigate in a direct way the optimization principle for the extreme signal from experiments in a well - controlled laboratory environment .",
    "one possibility is to calculate the values of the relevant functionals from the measured signal at the extreme position , and investigate how close these values are near the optimal values from the minimizing property .",
    "another , less robust ( and therefore maybe more informative ) method may be to use the fact that the extremizing property reflects itself in a simple phase - plane representation of the signal , see @xcite , so that the phase plane representation of the experimental extreme signals could give an indirect indication .",
    "further research in this direction will be executed .",
    "regular discussions with gert klopman ( utwente ) and renee huijsmans ( marin ) have been helpful .",
    "special thanks to francesco fedele for referring to @xcite  and some useful discussions . financial support from ruti ( ministry of research and technology , indonesia ) in the project ` wave motion and simulation ' , and support for visits to itb of evg and nk by eu - jakarta project spf2004/079 - 057 , and for visit of nk to rogue waves 04 by jmburgers centre , is acknowledged .",
