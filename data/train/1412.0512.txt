    "in a photosynthetic organism , sunlight is absorbed in the light - harvesting complex ( lhc ) or antenna , by a light - sensitive ( chlorophyll or carotenoid ) molecule .",
    "this is the first step in transforming solar energy into electron energy in the form of the exciton .",
    "this exciton travels through many connected sites ( pigments ) of the antenna complex , and finally reaches the reaction center ( rc ) , where charge separation and chemical reactions take place .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite , and references therein . )",
    "the timescale of the primary processes of electron ( exciton ) transfer ( et ) and charge separation are very fast , @xmath0 .",
    "there are two major theoretical challenges in describing these primary processes .",
    "the first problem is that the constant of interaction , @xmath1 , between the electron site , @xmath2 , and the protein environment is usually not small .",
    "indeed , the well - known marcus formula for the et rate , @xmath3 , between the donor and the acceptor , under the influence of the collective protein thermal fluctuations , has the form @xcite : @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "here @xmath5 is the difference between the donor and the acceptor site energies ; @xmath6 is the matrix element of the donor - acceptor interaction , @xmath7 is the absolute temperature ; @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant ; and @xmath9 is the so - called reconstruction energy , @xmath10 . as one can see , the interaction constant , @xmath11 , occurs in the denominators of both the pre - exponential factor and in the exponent .",
    "this result can not be obtained by using standard perturbative approaches by expanding the initial expressions in a power series in the interaction constant , @xmath11 .",
    "it is known that the marcus formula is derived in the high - temperature limit .",
    "but the complete set of conditions for the applicability of the marcus - type formula for complex biological networks with many sites is not known .",
    "then , the first mathematical problem of dealing with et in photosynthetic complexes is that there does not exist a closed system of equations ( exact or approximate , but derived under controlled conditions ) to deal with the et processes .",
    "indeed , the derivation of the equation for the reduced density matrix requires an averaging over the variables of the noisy protein environment . but",
    "( i ) this procedure can not be performed exactly and ( ii ) controlled perturbation approaches do not exist .",
    "the second problem is related to a large number of the electron sites ( or degrees of freedom ) in the lhc and in the rc .",
    "this results in a multi - scale et dynamics , so adequate coarse - grained procedures must be used @xcite .    in this situation",
    ", it would be useful to introduce a quantum exactly solvable ( at least , numerically ) model , which ( i ) applies to the et in the photosynthetic complexes and ( ii ) does not include the above mentioned restrictions on the interaction constants .",
    "this model was introduced in our earlier publications @xcite , and used to describe ( i ) multi - scale et dynamics and ( ii ) nonphotochemical quenching by a charge transfer state .    in this paper , we extend our approach @xcite to the case in which the random protein environment can act both collectively and independently on all light - sensitive electron sites ( pigments ) .",
    "namely , for all electron sites , we introduce both collective ( correlated ) and independent ( uncorrelated ) protein fluctuations , modeled by random telegraph processes .",
    "protein environments modeled by random processes and by the thermal bath usually produce different long - time asymptotic behavior for the et dynamics , we consider that our approach is appropriate for the problems under consideration .",
    "note also that protein environments in living organisms , have both noisy and thermal components @xcite .",
    "uncorrelated protein fluctuations can act on their neighboring pigments as well as on other pigments in the real photosynthetic organisms .",
    "experimentally , this can be verified by measuring the corresponding correlation functions of the protein fluctuations between different donor - acceptor sites .",
    "the correlation properties of protein fluctuations at different electron sites can also be modeled and simulated numerically using the standard molecular dynamics ( md ) approaches .",
    "the main results of our paper include :    * for rather arbitrary photosynthetic complexes , we derived an exact closed system of first - order linear differential equations , with constant coefficients , for the averaged density matrix elements and for their first moments , which describe the quantum et dynamics .",
    "* we applied our model to determine the quantum et dynamics of the simplest donor - acceptor system . under some conditions",
    ", we derived analytic expressions for the et rates , that are a generalization of the marcus - type expression for noisy protein environment .",
    "* we demonstrated numerically that the uncorrelated fluctuations of the protein environment can , under some conditions , either increase or decrease the et rates . *",
    "we compared our exact solutions with the corresponding approximate solutions , and found the conditions of the applicability of our perturbation approach .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii , we describe our model , and derive the closed system of differential equations for the averaged density matrix elements and for their moments . in section iii , we apply our approach to a specific  donor - acceptor \" system , introduce the characteristic parameters , and present the results of the numerical simulations for both exact and approximate solutions . in the conclusion ,",
