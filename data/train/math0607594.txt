    "then @xmath16 extends as a locally proper holomorphic correspondence across @xmath3 .",
    "we recall that if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are bounded domains , a holomorphic correspondence @xmath19 is a complex analytic set @xmath20 of pure dimension @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the boundary of @xmath24 .",

    "the symmetric functions of these inverses are globally well - defined holomorphic functions on @xmath32 .",

    "finally , @xmath2 maps the relative interior of @xmath97 to the relative interior of @xmath98 .",
    "preservation of @xmath80 is not always possible even for holomorphic mappings as the following example shows : the domain @xmath99 is mapped to the unit ball in @xmath100 by the proper holomorphic mapping @xmath101 .",
    "points of the form @xmath102 are weakly pseudoconvex and in fact form @xmath103 , and @xmath104 maps them to strongly pseudoconvex points .",
    "we will write @xmath105 for a point @xmath106 . the word ` analytic ' will always mean complex analytic unless stated otherwise",
    ". the techniques of segre varieties will be used and here is a synopsis of the main properties that will be needed .",
    "the proofs of these can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as described above , let @xmath3 be a smooth , real analytic hypersurface of finite type in @xmath6 that contains the origin . if @xmath9 is small enough",
    ", the complexification @xmath107 of @xmath108 is well - defined by means of a convergent power series in @xmath109 .",
    "note that @xmath107 is holomorphic in @xmath110 and anti - holomorphic in @xmath111 .",
    "for any @xmath112 , the associated segre variety is defined as @xmath113 by the implicit function theorem , it is possible to choose neighbourhoods @xmath114 of the origin such that for any @xmath115 , @xmath116 is a closed , complex hypersurface in @xmath117 and @xmath118 where @xmath119 is holomorphic in @xmath120 and anti - holomorphic in @xmath111 . such neighbourhoods will be called a standard pair of neighbourhoods and they can be chosen to be polydiscs centered at the origin . it can be shown that @xmath116 is independent of the choice of @xmath108 . for @xmath121 , the germ @xmath116 at @xmath122",
    "will be denoted by @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath124 be the set of all segre varieties , and let @xmath125 be the so - called segre map .",
    "then @xmath126 admits the structure of a finite dimensional analytic set .",
    "it can be shown that the analyticset @xmath127 is contained in @xmath3 if @xmath128 .",
    "consequently , the finite type assumption on @xmath3 forces @xmath129 to be a discrete set of points .",
    "thus @xmath130 is proper in a small neighbourhood of each point of @xmath3 . for @xmath131 , the symmetric point @xmath132 is defined to be the unique point of intersection of the complex normal to @xmath3 through @xmath111 and @xmath116 .",
    "the component of @xmath133 that contains the symmetric point is denoted by @xmath134 .",
    "finally , for all objects and notions considered above , we simply add a prime to define their corresponding analogs in the target space .",
    "in the proof of theorem  1.1 in order to show extension of @xmath2 as a holomorphic correspondence , it is enough to consider the problem in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of any point @xmath136 .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "firstly , since the projection @xmath137 is proper , the closure of @xmath138 has empty intersection with @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , by @xcite   20.1 , to prove the continuation of @xmath43 across @xmath3 as an analytic set , it is enough to do that in a neighbourhood of any point in @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , once the extension of @xmath43 as a holomorphic correspondence in a neighbourhood of any point @xmath140 is established , then globally there exists a holomorphic correspondence defined in a neighbourhood @xmath35 of @xmath3 which extends @xmath43 . to see that simply observe",
    "that if @xmath141 is an analytic set extending @xmath2 , then by choosing smaller @xmath35 we may ensure that the projection to the first component is proper , as otherwise there would exist a point @xmath110 on @xmath3 such that @xmath142 has positive dimension ( here @xmath143 is the map associated with the set @xmath144 ) .",
    "this however contradicts local extension of @xmath43 near @xmath110 as a holomorphic correspondence .    since the projection @xmath137 is proper , @xmath39",
    "is contained in the analytic set @xmath145 , defined by the zero locus of holomorphic functions @xmath146 given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the generic number of images in @xmath149 , and @xmath150 ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath151 are holomorphic in @xmath12 and extend continuously up to @xmath3 .",
    "this is the definition of continuity of the correspondence @xmath43 up to @xmath3 which is equivalent to that given in  1.1 .",
    "the discriminant locus is @xmath152 , @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is a universal polynomial function of @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) and hence by the uniqueness theorem , it follows that @xmath157 is nowhere dense in @xmath3 , for all @xmath65 .",
    "the set of points @xmath158 on @xmath3 which do not belong to @xmath157 for any @xmath65 is therefore open and dense in @xmath3 . near each point @xmath21 on @xmath158",
    ", @xmath2 splits into well - defined holomorphic maps @xmath159 each of which is continuous up to @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath160 , the functions @xmath161 extend holomorphically to a neighbourhood of @xmath21 and hence @xmath2 extends as a holomorphic correspondence across @xmath21 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to show that @xmath2 extends across an open dense subset of @xmath162 . but",
    "this follows from lemma  3.2 and corollary  3.3 in @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath163 the non - empty open dense subset of @xmath3 across which @xmath2 extends as a holomorphic correspondence .",
    "fix @xmath164 and let @xmath165 .",
    "the continuity of @xmath2 allows us to choose neighbourhoods @xmath166 and @xmath167 and local correspondences @xmath168 that are irreducible and extend continuously up to @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , @xmath169 for all @xmath170 . it will suffice to focus on one of the @xmath171 s , say @xmath172 and to show that it extends holomorphically across the origin . abusing notation",
    ", we will write @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "thus @xmath176 is an irreducible holomorphic correspondence and @xmath177 .",
    "define @xmath178 then @xmath179 is non - empty .",
    "indeed , @xmath2 extends across an open dense set near the origin and @xcite shows that the invariance property of segre varieties then holds .",
    "moreover , a similar argument as in @xcite shows that @xmath180 is an analytic set of dimension @xmath38 and exactly the same arguments as in lemmas  4.2   4.4 of @xcite show that : first , the projection @xmath181 is proper ( and hence that @xmath182 is open ) and second , the projection @xmath183 is locally proper .",
    "thus , to @xmath179 is associated a correspondence @xmath184 whose branches are @xmath185 .",
    "let @xmath186 be a point close to the origin , across which @xmath2 extends as a holomorphic correspondence .",
    "if @xmath2 is well - defined in the ball @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , it follows from theorem  4.1 in @xcite that all points in @xmath190 have the same segre variety . by analytic continuation ,",
    "the same holds for all @xmath191 . using this observation , it is possible to define another correspondence @xmath192 whose branches are @xmath193 .",
    "let @xmath194 .",
    "the invariance property of segre varieties shows that the correspondences @xmath195 can be glued together near points on @xmath196 .",
    "hence , there is a well - defined correspondence @xmath197 whose values over @xmath11 and @xmath198 are @xmath199 and @xmath200 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath201 is an analytic set in @xmath202 of pure dimension @xmath38 , with proper projection @xmath203 .",

    "on the other hand , since @xmath437 , it follows , as in @xcite , that @xmath438 proposition  8.3 of @xcite shows that @xmath439 and hence by proposition  [ p ] , it follows that @xmath2 extends as an analytic set across the origin .    to complete the proof , it suffices to show that extension as an analytic set implies extension as a locally proper holomorphic correspondence .",

    ", the proof of proposition  3.1 ( or even proposition  4.1 in @xcite ) shows that @xmath299 is in the envelope of holomorphy of @xmath446 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath151 in can be regarded as holomorphic functions on @xmath447 ( i.e. , independent of the @xmath448 variables ) and thus each @xmath151 extends holomorphically across @xmath299 .",
    "this extension must be independent of the @xmath448 variables by the uniqueness theorem and hence @xmath151 extends holomorphically across the origin .",
    "this shows that @xmath2 extends as a holomorphic correspondence across the origin . to show the existence of the sequence @xmath449 claimed above ,",
    "let @xmath203 be the natural projection and define @xmath450 where @xmath451 denotes the germ of the fiber over @xmath110 at @xmath452 .",

    "the following two general observations can be made in this situation .",
    "first , the branching locus @xmath472 of @xmath205 is an analytic set in @xmath9 and the finite - type assumption on @xmath3 shows that the real dimension of @xmath473 is at most @xmath76 . the branching locus of @xmath2 denoted by @xmath474 ,",

    "fix @xmath485 for some large @xmath486 . by shifting @xmath487 slightly",
    ", we may assume that @xmath488 , where @xmath489 is the branching locus of @xmath490 , and at the same time retain the property of having at least one negative eigenvalue .",
    "let @xmath491 be a locally biholomorphic branch of @xmath490 near @xmath487 .",
    "then @xmath492 is clearly a pseudoconvex point and this contradicts the invariance of the levi form .",
    "this shows that @xmath493 .",
    "the same arguments show that @xmath494 .",
    "let @xmath495 and suppose that @xmath496 .",
    "the extending correspondence @xmath197 satisfies the invariance property , namely @xmath497 for all @xmath498 .",
    "but near @xmath483 , the segre map @xmath499 is injective and this shows that @xmath205 , and hence @xmath2 , is a single valued , proper holomorphic mapping , say @xmath500 with @xmath501 .",
    "two observations can be made at this stage : first , @xmath104 can not be locally biholomorphic near @xmath21 due to the invariance of the levi form .",
    "second , if @xmath502 is the branching locus of @xmath104 defined by the vanishing of the jacobian determinant of @xmath104 , then @xmath503 intersects both @xmath476 . indeed , suppose that @xmath504 . choose a branch of @xmath505 near some fixed point @xmath506 and analytically continue it along all paths in @xmath507 to get a well - defined mapping , say @xmath508 .",
    "the analytic set @xmath509 extends @xmath510 as a correspondence and hence @xcite @xmath510 is a well - defined holomorphic mapping in @xmath10 and this must be the single valued inverse of @xmath104 .",
    "thus @xmath104 is locally biholomorphic near @xmath21 and this is a contradiction .",

    "thus @xmath514 is mapped locally biholomorphically to @xmath515 which is a strongly pseudoconvex point and this is a contradiction . if @xmath516 , then again we shrink @xmath9 so that @xmath517 and @xmath518",
    ". then @xmath104 is locally biholomorphic near all points in @xmath519 and therefore @xmath520 must cluster only along @xmath81 .",
    "since the cr dimension of @xmath521 which is one less than the dimension of @xmath503 , it follows ( theorem  18.5 in @xcite ) that @xmath522 is a closed , analytic set in @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath520 has two analytic continuations , namely @xmath503 and @xmath522 and therefore they must be the same .",
    "this shows that @xmath503 can not intersect @xmath11 which is a contradiction .",
    "the same argument works if @xmath523 , the only difference being that @xmath524 is analytic because of shiffman s theorem . thus if @xmath525 , then @xmath526 .    to study this further ,",
    "suppose that @xmath527 and @xmath528 .",
    "choose @xmath5 small enough so that @xmath513 and @xmath529 .",

    "working with one of these mappings , say @xmath530 , it follows that @xmath531 due to the invariance of the levi form .",
    "this means that @xmath532 . in the same way ,",
    "all points in @xmath79 that are sufficiently near @xmath514 are mapped locally biholomorphically by @xmath530 to @xmath533 .",
    "this can not happen as @xmath533 has strictly smaller dimension than @xmath79 .",

    "the case when @xmath539 can be dealt with similarly .",
    "now suppose that @xmath540 .",
    "as always , @xmath5 will be small enough so that @xmath541 and @xmath542 .",
    "the arguments used above show that the cluster set of points in @xmath543 is contained in @xmath544 and hence @xmath2 splits into finitely well - defined mappings each of which is locally biholomorphic near points in @xmath543 .",
    "this shows that the branching locus @xmath545 of @xmath2 clusters only along @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath546 is an analytic set of dimension @xmath85 in @xmath507 .",
    "there are two cases to consider : first , if @xmath546 clusters only along @xmath547 , then arguing as above , @xmath548 is a closed , analytic set in @xmath10 .",
    "the strong disk theorem shows that @xmath483 is in the envelope of holomorphy of @xmath507 and this is a contradiction .",
    "second , if there are points in @xmath549 , this means that @xmath550 has real dimension at most @xmath74 .",
    "pick @xmath551 and note that the continuity of @xmath2 implies that @xmath552 .",
    "as seen above , this can not happen .",
    "thus @xmath553 or @xmath554 .",
    "similar arguments show that if @xmath555 or @xmath556 , then @xmath557 or @xmath558 respectively .    by reversing the roles of @xmath476 ,",
    "the same arguments used in the preceding paragraphs can be applied to show that @xmath559 with the preservation of @xmath560 for @xmath96 .",
