    "the use of fixed point ( fp ) actions for asymptotically free theories has been shown to be profitable in reducing lattice artefacts in numerical simulations  @xcite .",

    ", a determination of the topological susceptibility in the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2-model did not show a scaling behavior .",
    "the result suggests , not quite unexpectedly  @xcite , that the topological susceptibility is not a physical quantity in this model . in the @xmath1 model one",
    "expects the topological susceptibility to be meaningful .",
    "however , recent determinations gave contradictory results  @xcite .    in order to overcome these problems",
    ", we discuss the definition of a fixed point action and a fixed point topological charge for @xmath0 models .",
    "we present results of numerical simulations in the @xmath1 model .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the definitions and the numerical results can be found in ref .",
    "two - dimensional @xmath0 models are a class of models which in many respects are similar to qcd .",
    "they consist of @xmath3-component , complex spin fields @xmath4 of unit length .",
    "the fp action is defined as the fp of an exact renormalization group ( rg ) transformation .",
    "the rg transformation relates the spins @xmath5 sitting at the lattice sites of a @xmath6 block @xmath7 of a fine lattice with a block spin @xmath8 sitting on a coarse lattice .",
    "the fp action is determined by the fp equation @xmath9 with the transformation kernel @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a free parameter that is used to optimize the corresponding fp action and @xmath12 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath13 one can solve the fp equation iteratively for any given input configuration @xmath14 . in doing this , we may use a multigrid with @xmath14 on the coarsest level .",
    "the configurations on the finer levels are varied until the minimum is reached which yields the value of the the fp action for @xmath14 . on the finest level",
    "the field is very smooth , so we can use any discretization of the continuum action , e.g. the standard action .",
    "if one wants to use the fp action in a numerical simulation one has to use a parametrization .",
    "our parametrization has the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the angle between two spins .",
    "we determined a parametrization for the @xmath1 model with 32 couplings ( 2 analytically calculated quadratic couplings @xmath17 and 30 numerically determined higher order couplings which involve 2- , 3- and 4-spin interactions ) which deviates only negligibly from the ( minimized ) fp action even for rough configurations @xcite .",
    "in ref .  @xcite it was shown , that the fp action admits scale invariant instanton solutions . in particular , it can be shown , that if @xmath14 is an instanton configuration of size @xmath18 ( in units of the lattice spacing ) and hence its action has a value of @xmath19 , then the minimizing configuration @xmath20 is an instanton configuration as well .",
    "its size is @xmath21 and the value of its action is also @xmath19 .",
    "this property leads us to the definition of a fp topological charge  @xcite .",
    "it is obtained in the limit of infinitely many rg transformations : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the solution of the iterated fp  equation on the lowest level in a @xmath24-level multigrid .",
    "as the configurations get smoother on each successive level , one may choose for the charge @xmath25 on the lowest level any lattice discretization of the topological charge .",
    "in this work we used the geometric definition of the topological charge .",
    "the combination fp action and fp topological charge obeys for any configuration the inequality @xmath26 , i.e. there are no topological defects .    this property is well illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : inst ] . here",
    "we plot for the @xmath1 model the topological charges and the actions for 2-instanton solutions on a torus .    to calculate the fp charge in numerical simulations , it is very time consuming to minimize a multigrid for every configuration .",
    "one needs a parametrization of the solution @xmath20 of the fp  equation .",
    "we construct a gauge invariant parametrization by calculating the matrix @xmath27 and define the fine field variable @xmath5 as the eigenvector of @xmath28 with largest eigenvalue . in higher order terms enters the angle @xmath29 between the coarse spins at sites @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . similar to the fp action we can determine for the @xmath1 model the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 analytically and by a fitting procedure  @xcite .",
    "we performed mc simulations in the @xmath1 model using the parametrized fp action with a hybrid overrelaxation algorithm .",
    "we determined the fp charge by calculating the charge on the first finer level which was obtained by either minimizing eq .",
    "( [ fp - equation ] ) or by using the parametrization  ( [ parametfield ] ) .",
    "we keep the volume @xmath34 approximately constant . at this value",
    "we still observe finite size effects but the constant volume allows to look for a scaling behavior .",
    "the mass gap shows an unexpected asymptotic scaling behavior even at quite small correlation lengths ( fig .",
