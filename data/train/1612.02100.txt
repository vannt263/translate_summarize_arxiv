    "in this paper we address a geometric problem originating in materials science .",

    "the method has immediate applications to frameworks of vertex - kissing tetrahedra , which include the important family of crystalline materials known as zeolites .",
    "* motivation : auxetic behavior in materials science .",
    "* when a physical material is stretched along an axis , its `` typical '' response is a lateral shrinking . yet",
    "this behavior is not universal : certain natural or man - made materials have the rather counter - intuitive property of widening rather than shrinking .",
    "this type of `` growth '' has been called _ auxetic behavior _ @xcite . in elasticity theory , poisson s ratio for two orthogonal directions @xmath0 and @xmath1 is defined as the signed ratio of the lateral effect along @xmath1 to the extension along @xmath0 due to uniaxial tension applied in that direction . for `` typical '' materials",
    "the poisson s ratio is taken with a positive sign , while materials with auxetic behavior are said to have negative poisson s ratios @xcite .",
    "the difference is often illustrated in the literature with the 2d periodic bar - and - joint _ honeycomb _ examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : honeycomb ] .    in mineralogy , the `` rigid unit mode '' approach to displacive phase transitions in crystalline materials relies on the periodic framework structure at the atomic level @xcite . in this context ,",
    "auxetic behavior was observed for cristobalite @xcite and conjectured among zeolites @xcite . for cellular ( periodic ) materials , the importance of the underlying geometry has been frequently emphasized @xcite .",
    "however , the approach via determinations of poisson s ratios has produced only a limited catalog of structures capable of auxetic behaviour @xcite .",
    "currently , with new and augmented possibilities for digital fabrication ( 3d printing ) and an increased need for synthetic _ smart _ materials , geometric structural design has reached critical importance @xcite .    in our recent work @xcite , we laid the foundations of a strictly geometric theory of auxetic deformations for periodic bar - and - joint frameworks .",
    "auxetic behavior is recognized based on the evolution of the periodicity lattice along one - parameter trajectories . as reviewed after this introduction",
    ", the hallmark of an auxetic trajectory is that the gram matrix of a basis of periods traces a curve of symmetric matrices with all tangent directions contained in the positive semidefinite cone .",
    "this purely geometric approach has uncovered new principles for auxetic design @xcite and has opened the door to developing rigorous mathematical techniques for studying auxeticity .    *",
    "main theoretical result : overview . * in this paper , we investigate the auxetic capabilities of a natural class of three - dimensional periodic frameworks , which includes many structures of interest in mineralogy and materials science , such as silica and zeolites @xcite . specifically , we address the following problem .",

    "decide if @xmath2 allows strictly auxetic local trajectories and if so , produce a local ( infinitesimal ) auxetic deformation .       as it is often the case with similar questions in rigidity theory and kinematics , we assume certain genericity conditions on the framework ( they will be stated explicitly in section [ sec : frameworks ] ) . in practice",
    ", most tetrahedral crystal frameworks would satisfy our conditions , which guarantee that local deformations are represented by variations of the periodicity lattice and the three dimensional tangent space at the initial configuration is in general position .",
    "the connection with elliptic curves indicated in the title comes from restricting the determinant function on symmetric @xmath5 matrices to such a three - dimensional vector subspace .",
    "the genericity condition will imply that the resulting ternary cubic form defines a non - singular projective curve .",
    "the most remarkable theoretical fact is that our question about auxetic capabilities of the periodic framework turns into a question about the real points of an elliptic curve .    *",
    "main algorithmic result : overview . *",
    "our formulation of auxetic behavior leads to significant connections with convex algebraic geometry , spectrahedra and semidefinite programming , as already noted in @xcite , corollary 7.1 .",
    "in particular , deciding infinitesimal auxeticity for a @xmath6-periodic bar - and - joint framework can be formulated as a semi - definite program ( sdp ) in fixed - dimension @xmath6 , for which polynomial time solutions exist @xcite ; see also @xcite for a recent survey on the related topic of low - rank sdp . using the new connections with elliptic curves presented in this paper",
    ", we can avoid the sdp machinery for the family of @xmath3-vertex , @xmath7-edge orbit periodic frameworks . specifically",
    ", classical results on the hesse form of a cubic , aronhold invariants and the modular @xmath8-invariant @xcite lead to a simpler and cleaner decision algorithm . the main steps of the algorithm involve solving an under - constrained linear system with @xmath7 linear equations in @xmath9 unknowns , along with several algebraic calculations on cubic polynomials .",
    "* related work .",
    "* in @xcite , we defined and studied the stronger concept of _ expansive deformation path _ for a periodic framework , and proved that it is necessarily an auxetic path . for 2d frameworks",
    ", we gave a complete combinatorial characterization ( based on periodic pseudo - triangulations ) of those frameworks that admit expansive deformations @xcite .",
    "this leads , in particular , to an infinite family of planar periodic `` auxetic mechanisms '' . for arbitrary dimensions ,",

    "the 3d frameworks studied in this paper have @xmath3 vertex orbits and @xmath4 edge orbits .",
    "we assume independent edge constraints and this implies a smooth three - dimensional local deformation space , i.e. three degrees of freedom .",
    "this choice is not accidental . in general , for arbitrary dimension @xmath6 , the class of frameworks with @xmath3 vertex orbits and @xmath10 edge orbits has distinctive mathematical properties ; for instance , the invariance of the ratio @xmath11 under relaxations of periodicity .",
    "a special family in dimension @xmath12 is the family of pointed pseudo - triangulations .",
    "another important family , in arbitrary dimension @xmath6 , consists of periodic frameworks made of ( 1-skeleta of ) `` kissing - simplices '' ; every vertex is common to exactly two simplices .",

    "a @xmath6-periodic graph is a pair @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a simple infinite graph with vertices @xmath15 , edges @xmath16 and finite degree at every vertex , and @xmath17 is a free abelian group of automorphisms which has rank @xmath6 , acts without fixed points and has a finite number of vertex ( and hence , also edge ) orbits .",

    "there are @xmath83 unknowns and @xmath23 equations .",
    "infinitesimally , our auxetic criterion requires @xmath84 to be a positive semi - definite matrix , while strict infinitesimal auxeticity needs a positive definite @xmath84 .",
    "it follows immediately that _ infinitesimal auxetic deformations _",
    "define a _ cone _ in the tangent space at @xmath2 of the framework s deformation space .",
    "we speak of _ infinitesimal auxetic capabilities _ when there are infinitesimal deformations with @xmath85 and @xmath84 positive semidefinite .    in convex",
    "optimization theory and semidefinite programming , an affine section of the positive semidefinite cone in the linear space of symmetric @xmath38 matrices is called a _ spectrahedron _ @xcite .",
    "when the section goes through the origin we have a _",
    "spectrahedral cone_. thus , when we look for infinitesimal auxetic capabilities , we have to look at the image of the space of infinitesimal deformations in the space of symmetric @xmath38 matrices and examine its intersection with the positive semidefinite cone .",
    "this important connection between infinitesimal auxetic capabilities of a periodic framework and semidefinite programming was established in @xcite , corollary 7.1 and will be a pivotal element of the current investigation , which is targeted on a specific class of three - dimensional periodic frameworks with three degrees of freedom . from this perspective",
    ", our inquiry will be concerned with the six - dimensional vector space of @xmath5 symmetric matrices and spectrahedral cones resulting from the intersection of the positive semidefinite cone with ( generic ) three - dimensional vector subspaces .",
    "there are several motivations for looking at three - dimensional periodic frameworks with three degrees of freedom .",
    "applications to crystalline materials evidently require dimension three and important families studied for properties related to framework flexibility have , geometrically , three degrees of freedom . zeolites , for instance , have framework structures made of vertex sharing tetrahedra and generic periodic frameworks of this type have , locally , a three - dimensional deformation space @xcite .",
    "if we assume independent edge constraints in the linear system obtained above for infinitesimal deformations , we see that a three dimensional solution space amounts to @xmath4 . mathematically , this type of periodic framework is quite relevant for periodicity relaxation problems , since this proportion of edge orbits to vertex orbits remains the same when adopting a sublattice of periods ( of finite index ) .    as with similar definitions in rigidity theory",
    ", we have to assume certain genericity conditions on the framework , in particular independence of the edges @xcite . for reasons that will become clear along the way ,",
    "in this paper we consider only _ regular periodic frameworks _ in @xmath86 , defined by the following :       1 .",
    "the number of edge representatives is @xmath4 .",
    "the edge constraints are independent , that is , the system has maximal rank @xmath87 .",
    "the projection from infinitesimal deformations to @xmath5 symmetric matrices : @xmath88 is one - to - one .",
    "4 .   the projective cubic curve obtained by restricting the determinant function to the image of the above projection is non - singular .",
    "we can now formulate precisely the problem solved in this paper :    let @xmath2 be a 3d _ regular _ periodic bar - and - joint framework .",
    "decide if @xmath2 allows strictly auxetic deformations and if so , produce a local ( infinitesimal ) auxetic deformation .",
    "* remarks . *",
    "it follows from the implicit function theorem , under the regularity conditions stated above , that the local deformation space of @xmath2 is a _",
    "smooth threefold_. this means , in particular , that it is enough to solve the infinitesimal problem of _ deciding if @xmath2 has strictly auxetic infinitesimal deformations _ , since any curve of symmetric matrices with a positive definite tangent directions at one point will maintain this property in a neighborhood of that point .",
    "in other words , @xmath2 _ allows strictly auxetic deformations _ if and only if it _ allows strictly auxetic infinitesimal deformations . _    moreover , under the genericity condition ( iv ) , intersecting the positive definite cone is equivalent with intersecting non - trivially its closure , the positive semidefinite cone , since we have a transversal intersection with the boundary in the generic case .",
    "thus , our decision problem turns into the general question about infinitesimal auxetic capabilities which can be solved by semidefinite programming as stated in @xcite , corollary 7.1 .",
    "the solution presented in this paper for our distinctive class of frameworks shows that geometric characteristics can be used for alternative algorithms , and thus avoid the general machinery of semidefinite programming @xcite .",
    "in this section we explain our geometrical approach , present the theoretical basis of the decision algorithm and review the classical results about elliptic curves .",
    "we have shown above that the question about strictly auxetic deformations of a regular periodic framework @xmath2 leads to an intersection problem in the space of @xmath5 symmetric matrices between the positive semidefinite cone and a three - dimensional vector subspace image of the infinitesimal deformations of @xmath2 .",
    "strictly auxetic deformations exist if and only if the three - dimensional vector subspace cuts through the positive definite cone .",
    "our approach is to investigate the resulting intersection with the boundary of the positive definite cone , which is contained in the vanishing locus of the determinant function .",
    "since this function is a homogeneous cubic form , its restriction to our three - dimensional subspace gives a _ ternary cubic form _ and projectively , a real cubic curve in @xmath89 .",
    "the genericity condition ( iv ) allows the assumption that this cubic curve is non - singular ( over the complex numbers @xmath90 ) .",
    "non - singular projective cubics are also known as _ elliptic curves _ and there is a wealth of classical results about them .",
    "we limit the main references to @xcite , which cover all the facts needed for our arguments .",
    "different sources may have different choices of coefficients in front of certain invariants . since we are concerned with real ternary cubics , we follow mostly @xcite .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional real vector space with coordinates @xmath91 .",
    "we are interested in real cubic forms @xmath92 and the projective cubic curves @xmath93 they define in @xmath89 , with projective coordinates @xmath94 .",
    "there are ten distinct monomials of degree three in @xmath95 and a ternary cubic form is determined by the ten coefficients of these monomials .",
    "* hesse normal form . *",
    "a non - singular real projective cubic @xmath93 is projectively equivalent over @xmath96 with a unique cubic of the form : @xmath97    with @xmath98 .",
    "this form is called the hesse normal form of the cubic .",

    "homogeneous polynomials in the coefficients of ternary cubics are called invariant when they remain unchanged under this induced action .",
    "the aronhold invariants @xmath103 and @xmath104 are given by two explicit invariant polynomials ( with rational coefficients ) of degree four , respectively six @xcite",
    ".    * discriminant . *",
    "the discriminant @xmath106 is the invariant polynomial of degree twelve given by : @xmath107    a cubic form defines a non - singular curve in @xmath108 if and only if @xmath109 . for negative @xmath106 ,",
    "the real cubic in @xmath89 is connected , while for positive @xmath106 , it has two connected components .",
    "* modular invariant @xmath8 . *  for non - singular cubic forms , the _ modular invariant _ @xmath8 is defined as a rational expression in the aronhold invariants @xmath103 and @xmath104 by the formula : @xmath110    since both numerator and denominator are homogeneous polynomials of degree twelve , the modular invariant @xmath8 is invariant under the general linear group @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , two non - singular cubic curves in @xmath108 are projectively equivalent over @xmath90 if and only if @xmath8 gives the same value when evaluated for the two cubic forms in the defining equations .",
    "this value is called the _ modulus _ of the curve .    for a cubic in _",
    "hesse normal form _",
    ", we refer to the corresponding ternary form directly through the hesse parameter @xmath112 .",

    "unique _ real parameter @xmath112 which gives a hesse curve projectively equivalent over @xmath96 with the curve @xmath130 , although , as reviewed above , there s another real parameter yielding the same modulus @xmath129 .",

    "after this brief review of relevant classical notions and results , we proceed now with our inquiry .",
    "let us observe first that , if our ( generic ) three - dimensional subspace of @xmath5 symmetric matrices cuts through the positive definite cone , the corresponding ( non - singular ) real cubic curve must have _ two connected components_. this follows from the fact that the intersection with the boundary of the positive definite cone gives one component which appears as a convex curve in adequately chosen affine planes . since this component can not contain inflection points , there must be a second component .",
    "we obtain :    [ lem : negative ] if the discriminant of the ternary cubic @xmath126 associated to the periodic framework @xmath2 is negative , i.e. @xmath143 , then the framework does not allow non - trivial auxetic deformations .",
    "however , a positive discriminant is not a sufficient condition for strictly auxetic capabilities . we must check if the connected component without inflection points actually corresponds with positive semidefinite matrices",

    "note that , by proposition  [ find_k ] , the hesse parameter can be determined from the invariants @xmath144 .",

    "we explain this procedure in more detail . for a cubic in hesse normal form ,",

    "are concurrent only for @xmath150 , when the real curve is connected .",
    "thus , for real cubics with two real components ( i.e. @xmath151 ) , the three tangents and the line @xmath99 of the inflection points give four points in general position in the dual projective plane @xmath152 .",
    "it follows that , if we know the three real inflection points of a non - singular real cubic with two connected components , we can compute the three tangent lines and , after choosing a matching order for the inflection points , there is a unique real projective transformation which takes the line of real inflection points to the line @xmath99 of the cubic s hesse normal form and matches the inflection points and tangents .",
    "obviously , this projective transformation takes the cubic to its hesse normal form .",
    "a different choice of matching order for the inflection points amount to composition with a permutation of the variables @xmath95 .",

    "we remark that the algorithm runs on all _ generic inputs_. in particular , the set of inputs on which it will stop without giving a definitive answer has measure zero .    * analysis . * in step 1 , we set up the @xmath7 linear equations with @xmath9 unknowns @xmath78 corresponding to the infinitesimal flexes @xmath176 of the lattice coordinates @xmath177 of the framework and infinitesimal changes @xmath84 in the @xmath155 parameters describing the symmetric gram matrix @xmath53 .",
    "we solve the linear system , and attempt to express @xmath7 of the dependent variables in terms of @xmath154 free variables chosen from among the @xmath84 .",
    "if this is not possible , then we stop and report that the framework is not regular . in step 2 , we compute the determinant of the @xmath5 infinitesimal gram matrix @xmath84 , whose entries are linear forms in the three free variables and obtain the ternary cubic described in section [ sec : cubics ] . in step 3 ,",
    "we compute the s and t aronhold invariants of the cubic and the discriminant @xmath106 described in section [ sec : cubics ] .",
    "we stop if @xmath178 : the framework violates the regularity conditions . if @xmath179 , the framework does not have auxetic capabilities , cf . lemma [ lem : negative ] . otherwise ,",
    "if @xmath180 , we apply the procedure described in section [ sec : cubics ] after lemma [ lem : negative ] to distinguish , correctly , the auxetic and non - auxetic cases .    * complexity . * the running time of the algorithm",
    "is dominated by step 1 ( gaussian elimination ) and takes @xmath181 arithmetic operations .",
    "the other steps are constant time calculations involving equations of degree at most 3 .",
    "* extensions .",
    "* the decision algorithm can be easily modified to return an actual auxetic infinitesimal deformation .",
    "indeed , the pre - image of the point @xmath145 in step 4 gives specific values for the free variables @xmath182 of the cubic from step 2 , and all the infinitesimal deformation variables ( for the points @xmath183 and for the gram matrix @xmath53 ) can be expressed in terms of these three values , cf .",
    "finally , the step - by - step calculation of infinitesimal auxetic deformations can be used in a standard numerical simulation , with a sufficiently small time step , of an auxetic trajectory , if one exists .",

    "we define a family of periodic frameworks @xmath184 in @xmath86 with @xmath185 vertex orbits and @xmath186 edge orbits .",
    "the periodicity lattice is the standard integer lattice @xmath187 and the chosen generators are the vectors @xmath188 of the standard basis .",
    "the first orbit of vertices is represented by the origin ( the red point in fig .",
    "[ fig : example2verts6edges ] ) , and coincides with @xmath187 . for @xmath184 , the second orbit of vertices is represented by the point @xmath189 ( the green point in fig .",
    "[ fig : example2verts6edges ] ) .",
    "the edge orbits are represented by six edges connecting @xmath190 with the vertices of the other orbit placed at @xmath191 ( the thick blue edges in fig .",

    "although @xmath195 in our initial setting , we maintain the notational distinction between lattice coordinates and cartesian coordinates .",
    "thus , the six edge vectors in lattice coordinates are written as @xmath196 and @xmath197 , and the linear system for infinitesimal deformations takes the form : @xmath198    exploiting permutation symmetry and choosing the diagonal elements of @xmath84 as parameters , the three - dimensional space of solutions @xmath84 is given by symmetric @xmath5 matrices with equal off - diagonal entries of the form : @xmath199    we notice the invariance of the fractional coefficient in under the involution @xmath200 , which comes from the isomorphism of the frameworks @xmath184 and @xmath201 when reflecting in the plane @xmath202 ( in cartesian coordinates ) .",
    "this formula follows from the necessary vanishing of monomial coefficients for @xmath222 etc .",
