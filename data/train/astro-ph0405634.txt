    "optical / near - ir colors , such as @xmath23 or @xmath24 have been commonly used in wide - area surveys to select old stellar populations at @xmath25 ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; mccarthy et al .  2001",
    "; mccarthy 2004 for the review of this subject ) . near - ir observations , which sample cool low - mass stars , are sensitive to old stellar populations .",
    "the ( @xmath26 of 5.3 corresponds to the calculated color of a passively evolving elliptical galaxy at @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , in principle , the color criterion of ( @xmath0mag or ( @xmath28mag ( eros ) should select early type galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "however , these color selections are also sensitive to dust - reddened , star - forming systems , and examples of both passively evolving ellipticals and dusty starburst eros have been found ( soifer et al .",
    "1999 ; hu &  ridgway 1994 ; mccarthy , persson &  west 1992 ; graham &  dey 1996 ) .",
    "this indicates that the optical / near - ir seds of these sources are sufficiently degenerate that these color criteria can not effectively distinguish between them .",
    "in addition , a small fraction of eros ( 10 - 20% ) could also be agn , as shown by deep chandra data and optical spectroscopy ( alexander et al . 2002 ; yan , thompson &  soifer 2004 ) . the relative contribution of these two galaxy types  old stellar populations and dust - reddened , star - forming galaxies  is a critical issue for many surveys whose goal is to determine the evolution of the mass function and the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "deep optical spectroscopy indicates that a large fraction ( 30 - 50% ) of eros have emission lines ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; yan , thompson &   soifer 2004 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "2004 ) ; however , it remains unclear what fraction of eros are truly dust obscured galaxies .",
    "mips 24@xmath2 data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( rieke et al . 2004 ; werner et al .",
    "2004 ) offer the first opportunity to directly address this critical issue .",
    "dusty , star - forming galaxies are clearly distinguished from early - type galaxies at mid - ir wavelengths . between @xmath25 ,",
    "the mips data is especially discriminating as strong , rest - frame 6@xmath2912@xmath8 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) dust features redshift into the 24@xmath2-band . in this letter",
    ", we present our initial study of the 24@xmath2 properties of the ( @xmath30)mag selected eros in elais n1 . throughout the paper , we adopt @xmath31km / s / mpc , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and the vega system for optical / nir magnitudes .",
    "the primary dataset used in this letter is in the elais n1 field , which is a part of the spitzer first look survey ( fls ) .",
    "the field was observed in a @xmath34 photometry mode mosaic , and the raw data were processed and stacked by the data processing pipeline at the spitzer science center ( ssc ) .",
    "source catalogs at 24@xmath2 were generated using starfinder ( diolaiti et al .",
    "2000 ) , which measures profile - fitted fluxes for point sources . the complete description of the 24@xmath2 data reduction and source catalog can be found in fadda et al .",
    "( 2004b ) and marleau et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . to aid in the interpretation of the results from elais n1",
    ", we also analyzed the fls verification strip ( flsv ) .",
    "the data presented here covers 64  sq.arcmin in elais n1 and 256  sq.arcmin in the flsv .",
    "table 1 summarizes the salient characteristics of all data used in this paper .",
    "all @xmath4-band observations were taken at the kitt peak national observatory .",
    "final stacked images and source catalogs have been publicly released ( fadda et al .",
    "the @xmath3-band data were obtained using the wide - field infrared camera ( wirc ) on the palomar 200-inch telescope .",
    "the @xmath35 data in elais n1 covers @xmath36 .",
    "a detailed description of the wirc observations and data reduction will included in a separate paper by choi et al .",
    "finally , high - resolution , optical spectra of a @xmath3-selected galaxy sample within the fls region were obtained using the keck , deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ) ( faber et al .",
    "a total of @xmath37 redshifts were measured , of which 112 ( 52 eros ) are included in the analysis in this paper .",
    "to merge the r / k and @xmath38 source catalogs , we used a simple positional matching method with a @xmath39 match radius , which corresponds to @xmath40 combined astrometric uncertainty from the @xmath3 and @xmath38 data . due to the relatively low source density ( 7arcmin@xmath41 ) , the likelihood of spurious matches is small ( 3% ) , consistent with the fact that we find only one multiple match out of 65 .",
    "in addition , we test the robustness of each match by comparing the probability of the measured separation based on the astrometric uncertainties to the probability of a spurious detection based on the 24@xmath2 source density .",
    "the probability ratios above unity imply to be likely real matches , and we found that all but two matches meet this criteria .",
    "we retained these two matches since the visual inspection suggests that they could still be associated with physical offset centroids .",
    "bright stars were rejected using @xmath4-band images .",
    "stellar contamination in our sample is expected to be small since the field is at the galactic latitude of 41@xmath42 , and 24@xmath2 data samples the tail of the rayleigh - jeans energy distribution .",
    "since the @xmath4- and @xmath3-band data have similar seeing , ( @xmath43 ) colors were measured using a fixed @xmath44 diameter aperture .",
    "the ero catalog with ( @xmath45mag and @xmath1mag ( 6@xmath7 ) consists of 129 galaxies over 64  sq.arcmin in elais n1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath46 vs. @xmath3 distribution for all sources ( _ black crosses_. the ( @xmath45mag and @xmath1mag limits are shown as _ solid horizontal _ and _ solid vertical lines _ , and sources with 24@xmath2",
    "detected counterparts are indicated as _ red open circles_. we find that 24@xmath2 detected sources have slightly redder ( @xmath43 ) colors than non - detected sources , consistent with the expectation that 24@xmath2 emission is an indicator of dust extinction .    of the 129 eros , 65 ( 50@xmath476% ) have 24@xmath2 emission with flux greater than 40@xmath8jy .",
    "the fraction of 24@xmath2 detected eros becomes slightly higher for redder sources , with 56@xmath48%  and 67@xmath49%  for ( @xmath50mag and ( @xmath51mag respectively .",
    "however , the errors of these fractions are large due to the shallow @xmath4 band limit .",
    "deeper data would be needed to reduce the uncertainties . in figure 2a",
    ", we show the 24@xmath2 flux distributions of both the total and ero samples .",
    "we find that 70%  of the 24@xmath2 eros have @xmath52jy and that the mean 24@xmath2 flux of the ero sample is 167@xmath8jy .",
    "figure 2b shows @xmath3 vs. 24@xmath2 flux for all detected sources ( _ solid squares _ ) and for the eros ( _ large open circles _ ) .",
    "we find that amongst the 24@xmath2 detected sources , @xmath3 is weakly correlated with @xmath53 , with large scatter .",
    "this is expected since these two bands sample light from different physical origins , stellar photosphere versus dust emission .",
    "this also explains why many faint @xmath3 sources have fairly bright 24@xmath2 fluxes .",
    "for @xmath3 bright ( @xmath54 ) and 24@xmath2-faint sources , the mid - infrared data is deep enough to detect the emission from normal galaxy populations at low redshifts .",
    "what types of galaxies are the 24@xmath2 detected eros ? in figure 3a , we present a 24-to-0.7@xmath2 and 24-to-2.2@xmath2 color - color diagram showing that 24@xmath2-detected eros ( _ red squares _ ) are clearly separated from eros without 24@xmath2 emission ( _ green points _ ) , as well as the general non - ero population ( _ black and blue _ ) .",
    "this suggests that the mir / optical and mir / nir colors of 24@xmath2-detected eros are unique , distinguishing them from other populations .",
    "figure 3b presents the expected colors as a function of redshift for various sed templates , assuming no evolution .",
    "the seds for m51 ( normal spiral ) , m82 ( starburst ) and mrk231 ( dusty agn ) are taken from silva et al .",

    "24@xmath2 sources from the flsv with known spectroscopic redshifts are marked to show the actual redshift range of the 24@xmath2 eros in elais n1 .",
    "of these 112 redshifts , 10 are 24@xmath2-detected eros with @xmath56 , and the optical spectra of these 10 sources all have [ oii]3727emission line .    comparing figure 3a & 3b , we reach the following conclusions : 1 ) 24@xmath2-detected eros in elais n1 with ( @xmath0mag , @xmath57mag , and @xmath58)@xmath59jy are infrared bright sources at @xmath11 .",
    "they have colors similar to starbursts like m82 at @xmath11 , or dust reddened agn like mrk231 at @xmath60 .",
    "their colors are too red to be explained by any normal spiral or old stellar populations at any redshifts .",
    "2 ) the likely redshift range of these 24@xmath2 eros is @xmath11 , as predicted from the model seds of m82 and mrk231 .",
    "this is further confirmed by comparison to the keck spectroscopic sample from the flsv .",
    "the remaining half of the ero population are probably galaxies with old stellar populations at @xmath10 , as suggested by the tracks in figure 3b .",
    "half of the elais n1 ero sample have 24@xmath2 dust emission .",
    "the key question is what their infrared luminosities are . in the previous section ,",
    "we conclude that the 24@xmath2-detected eros have colors similar to m82 , however , figure 3a does not set any constraints on either their luminosities or masses .",
    "we have a total of 112 redshifts for objects with 24@xmath2 counterparts ( the flsv 3@xmath7 flux limit is 90@xmath8jy ) . in figure 4",
    ", we present the observed 24@xmath2 luminosity versus redshift for the spectroscopic flsv sample . at @xmath10",
    "the observed 24@xmath2 luminosity roughly corresponds to the rest - frame iras 12@xmath2 luminosity , within a factor of 2 .",
    "the spitzer 24@xmath2 filter is narrower than the iras 12@xmath2 filter , but ignoring this difference , a crude conversion of the observed spitzer 24@xmath2 flux can be made to place a lower limit on the rest - frame iras 12@xmath2 luminosity .",
    "we can infer the total infrared luminosity of 24@xmath2 sources at @xmath61 by using the correlation between the 12@xmath2 luminosity ( @xmath62 ) and the infrared luminosity @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( soifer et al .",
    "1989 ; chary &  elbaz 2001 ) .",
    "the mean flux ( 167@xmath8jy ) of the 24@xmath2-detected eros in elais n1 implies the @xmath65 at @xmath66 and @xmath67 at @xmath68 , similar to that of local lirgs and uligs .",
    "the corresponding sfr is @xmath19/yr , using @xmath69 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the 3@xmath7 flux limit of 40@xmath8jy in elais n1 corresponds to a sfr of 12@xmath9/yr , more sensitive than the deepest 1.4ghz observation ( smail et al .",
    "2002 ) . in comparison ,",

    "our results are consistent with very deep 1.4ghz ( rms @xmath71jy ) measurements ( smail et al .",
    "2002 ) .",

    "the colors and inferred redshifts of the 24@xmath2-detected eros suggest that they are infrared - luminous , dusty sources at @xmath11 .",
    "their mean 24@xmath2 flux ( 167@xmath8jy ) corresponds to @xmath73 at @xmath10 and to @xmath74 at @xmath75 .",
    "some of these 24@xmath2-detected eros could be agn .",
    "the one mega - second chandra observation in the hdf and optical spectroscopy suggest that the fraction of eros likely to be agn is small , around 10 - 20%  ( alexander et al .",

    "these dusty agn can be identified when we combine this current analysis with the irac data .",
    "our result suggests that a significant fraction of eros are extremely active starbursts ( lirgs or uligs ) .",
    "if the time scale of this starbursting phase is on the order of @xmath20/yr , as inferred from local lirgs and uligs ( sanders &  mirabel 1996 ) , we can set a lower limit to the mass of these 24@xmath2-detected eros as sfr@xmath76 .",
    "if the eros _ without _ detectable 24@xmath2 are indeed massive systems with old stellar populations at @xmath10 as measured by several recent surveys ( glazebrook et al .  2004 ; bell et al .",
    "2003 ) , one plausible connection between the starburst and early - type ero populations is that the former may be in the process of transforming into the latter , as initially postulated by kormendy &  sanders ( 1992 ) . in the hierarchical clustering paradigm",
    ", it could be interpreted that our deep 24@xmath2 observations are capturing a massive galaxy population in the midst of violent transformation  possibly in the process of assembly via mergers / starbursts at the epoch of @xmath77 .",
    "the accurate determination of the stellar and dynamical masses of these starburst eros at @xmath78 will be critical for the resolution of this question .",
    "finally , the measurement of volume averaged mass density at @xmath79 would require a better understanding of the physical source of the integrated k - band light  whether from dusty systems or from old stars .",
