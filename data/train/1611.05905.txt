    "measurability of physical quantities is an integral part of any scientific theory .",
    "indeed , the whole endeavour of understanding natural phenomena relies crucially on the ability to assign values to the physical properties of the system of interest by means of performing measurements . as physical processes",
    ", measurements are subjected to and constrained by the laws of physics . in particular , it is known that quantum theory together with certain conservation laws can set limitations to the measurability of the quantum observables .",
    "more specifically , an observable which does not commute with an additive conserved quantity does not admit a repeatable and perfectly precise measurement  this limit is known as the wigner - araki - yanase ( way ) theorem @xcite .    in recent investigations the original theorem of way has been generalised to more widely applicable contexts . in particular , ways to omit the assumptions of the repeatability of the measurement @xcite and the additivity of the conserved quantity @xcite have been reported . moreover ,",
    "different quantitative generalisations of the way - theorem which relax the assumption of perfect precision have been studied in refs.@xcite . with all its extensions the current form of the way - theorem covers a large class of physically important scenarios and",
    "consequently has applications , not solely in quantum measurement theory , but also in the fields of quantum information processing and quantum control .",
    "for example , limitations on the realisability of quantum logic gates due to the way - theorem have been discussed in refs.@xcite .    even though the way - theorem has certainly been extended from the days of its inception ,",
    "its full scope is still unknown and the formalism of way is not particularly intuitive .",
    "our first main result is to introduce a new extension of the way - theorem , in which the assumptions of repeatability of the measurement and , not only the additivity , but even the central assumption of conservation of a quantity commuting with the measured observable can be omitted .",
    "formally , our result states that , whenever a quantity commutes with the evolved pointer of the apparatus , a part of it also necessarily commutes with the measured observable .",
    "in other words , in our explanation the way - theorem can be understood as a consequence of quantum _ compatibility _ @xcite of a given quantity with the evolved pointer partially inherited by the measured observable .",
    "we believe that the intuition behind this formalism is conceptually clearer than in the preceding formulations listed above .",
    "we also present examples that demonstrate the limitations of measurability , even if the assumptions of the original way - theorem are violated .",
    "strictly speaking , the restrictions posed by the way - theorem affect only the special class of quantum observables associated with the normalised projection valued measures .",
    "in vague terms , these _ sharp _ observables correspond to ideally precise measurements and the limitations of way - theorem may , in principle , be circumvented by introducing an arbitrarily small amount of inaccuracy in the measured observable : such imprecision can be described by associating the measured observable with a normalised positive operator valued measure .",
    "since noise is inevitably present in every real experiment , from a practical point of view the measured observables are generally _ unsharp _ and it may seem that the way - theorem exists only as a theoretical phenomenon .    it is our second main result to show that quantitative versions of the way - theorem persist also in the level of the unsharp observables . in particular , we reveal a natural relation , in which the sharpness of the measured observable and the amount of compatibility of the evolved pointer with a given ( additive conserved ) quantity govern the way - type limitations .",

    "we call this mapping from probe states to observables _ quantum programming _ , the fixed triplet @xmath214 a programmable quantum _ multimeter _ ( also known as a programmable processor ) and the variables of the multimeter _ programming states_.    the obvious advantage of a quantum multimeter over a fixed set - up is that one does not have to build multiple measurement apparatuses in order to implement different observables .",
    "it is known , however , that no multimeter is universal , that is one can not construct a multimeter @xmath214 that surjectively maps @xmath215 to the full set of observables on @xmath1 .",
    "this follows from the fact that all unequal sharp observables demand mutually orthogonal programming states and , consequently , the number of programmable sharp observables is bounded by the dimension of the multimeter @xcite . as the proof of this result is quite concise ,",
    "we will present it here for the readers convenience .",

    "it has been anticipated in ref.@xcite that the way - theorem will set further restrictions for the programmable quantum multimeters .",
    "it is the purpose of this section to validate this expectation . to this end , consider a programmable multimeter @xmath226 that realises a sharp observable @xmath227 with a programming state @xmath228 , @xmath229 .",

    "it is noteworthy , that the two multimeters @xmath214 and @xmath246 differ only by a local unitary transformation .",
    "accordingly , they are _ equivalent _ in sense they both program exactly the same set of observables , only with different programming states @xcite . in this formalism prop.[prop : wayprog ] relates the amount of ( in)compatibility of the evolved pointers of the two multimeters with the ( in)compatibility of the programmed observables .",
    "such a relation can be useful in designing optimal multimeters , e.g. for purposes of measurement based quantum computing .",
    "in summary , an approach to the theorem of wigner , araki and yanase ( way ) was introduced which expresses the measurability limitations in the language of quantum incompatibility .",
    "importantly , this formalism reveals a more intuitive and far more generally valid mathematical structure behind the way - theorem .",
    "in addition , two quantitative generalisations of way - type measurability restrictions to povms were presented .",
    "finally , we demonstrated the potential of our results in applications of quantum programming .",
    "even though this analysis was focusing on the way - limitations of quantum observables , we wish to point out that the formalism can be straightforwardly extended also for general quantum devices , e.g. quantum channels or instruments .",
    "for example , the similarity between unitary channels and sharp observables noted in ref.@xcite would allow one to find similar limitations to those proved here for quantum ( unitary ) channels .",
    "although the details are beyond the scope of this paper and will be left as a topic for separate investigation , this approach could potentially lead to way - type limitations on quantum logic gates and computation that are more straightforward and general than those reported in refs.@xcite .",
