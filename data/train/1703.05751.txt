    "the random motion of gas in galaxies can be traced from the width of the ubiquitous 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen ( hi ) .",
    "the amount of the disordered motion , the gas velocity dispersion , provides valuable information on the physical properties of the gas such as its ability to collapse and form stars , the energy balance and the phase structure of the gas @xcite .",
    "this parameter is usually determined by fitting hi profiles with an assumed model , e.g. , a single or a double gaussian function , a gauss - hermite polynomial , or a lorentzian @xcite . instead of assuming a model ,",
    "the intensity - weighted standard deviation of the line - of - sight velocities has also been used as a measure of hi velocity dispersion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an accurate determination of the hi velocity dispersion is limited by the ability of the imaging process to recover the intrinsic shapes of the hi line profiles . in radio interferometry ,",
    "the source intensity distribution is not completely sampled by the telescope array . therefore , to recover the missing values in the @xmath1 data and reconstruct the true image of the source , the telescope point spread function ( psf or dirty beam )",
    "needs to be deconvolved from the observed ( dirty ) image . as will be explained in detail later , the recovered image from a deconvolution algorithm",
    "is obtained by adding a deconvolved map of the model of the source brightness distribution ( derived down to a certain flux ) to a map containing the remaining emission , usually assumed to be noise ( the residual map ) .",
    "the width of the hi velocity profiles means that typically they will be spread over several velocity channels .",
    "the faint outer wings of these profiles can thus appear in adjacent channels but with intensities below the threshold for cleaning .",
    "the residual image will then still contain faint residual emission corresponding to these wings . in this paper",
    ", we investigate what the effect of this uncleaned , residual emission is on measurements of the velocity dispersion and find that it leads to an overestimate of this parameter .",
    "here we focus on data obtained as part of the things survey @xcite , but our conclusions will apply to all hi observations where the dirty beam is substantially different from a gaussian , such as is the case with multi - configuration very large array ( vla ) observations . this includes recent surveys such as , local irregulars that trace luminosity extremes : the hi nearby galaxy survey ( little things ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , vla survey of advanced camera for surveys nearby galaxy survey treasury galaxies ( vla - angst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , survey of hi in extremely low - mass dwarfs ( shield ; * ? ? ?",
    "this study is also relevant for other arrays that produce a non - gaussian dirty beam , e.g. , the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , meaning the results could also be relevant for molecular line velocity dispersions .    in section  [ sec : background ] , we give background on the weighting of visibilities and cleaning processes . in section",
    "[ sec : goal ] , we describe the analysis goal and method . in section  [ sec:1 ] , we compare hi velocity dispersion from different types of data cubes . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we investigate the type of data cubes that should be used in hi velocity dispersion analysis . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss our results and conclusions .",
    "interferometric observations of radio astronomical sources provide noisy samples of the complex visibility function of the sources at discrete locations in the @xmath2 plane @xcite , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the baseline vectors projected onto a plane perpendicular to the source direction .",
    "deconvolution algorithms attempt to recover the image information ( missing values ) in the un - sampled @xmath2 plane .",
    "the inverse fourier transform of the sampled visibility function , @xmath5 , is called _ the dirty image _ , @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a sampling function and @xmath9 is the visibility function . using the fourier convolution theorem , which states that the fourier transform of the product of two functions is the convolution of the fourier transform of the two functions , equation  [ eq : num1 ] becomes : @xmath10 in the radio astronomy jargon ,",
    "@xmath11 is called _ the dirty beam_. the true image is the inverse fourier transform of the visibility function , @xmath12 .",
    "a deconvolution algorithm involves solving for the true image given the dirty beam and the dirty image . to get the dirty image from the sampled visibility functions , a fast fourier transform ( fft )",
    "is usually preferable over the _",
    "simple _ fourier transform ( ft ) due to its computational speed .",
    "however , fft requires that the sample visibilities are on a regularly spaced grid ( cell ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the image reconstruction and gridding process , a weighting function",
    "is usually applied to the sampled visibility function to , e.g. , maximise point source sensitivity or to minimise sidelobe levels .",
    "if @xmath13 is a weighting function , then equation  [ eq : num1 ] becomes : @xmath14 many forms of weighting functions have been developed for different science goals .",
    "this paper discusses the effects of using different weighting schemes in the derivation of hi velocity dispersion .",
    "natural , uniform and robust ( or briggs ) weightings are widely known weighting schemes in radio interferometry .",
    "the natural weighting gives a weight of 1/@xmath15 on visibility @xmath16 , where @xmath15 is the noise variance of that visibility .",
    "in most cases , the noise is roughly similar for all visibilities and thus each @xmath2 points gets approximately the same weight . due to the gridding , @xmath2 cells at shorter baselines",
    "get more weight as the inner parts of the @xmath1 plane have a higher density of @xmath1 points ( i.e. , measured visibilities ) .",
    "thus , natural weighting offers the best surface brightness sensitivity and minimum noise , but at the cost of a larger beam size . for uniform weighting , a given cell in the @xmath2 plane",
    "gets a weight of 1/@xmath17 , where @xmath17 is the density of the @xmath2 points in the cell . given that the density of the @xmath2 points is usually lower at larger baselines , the latter are weighted more , resulting in better resolution but lower sensitivity ( short baselines are de - emphasized ) , and therefore an increased rms noise .",
    "the uniform weighting gives better ( i.e. , lower ) side lobes than the natural weighting .",
    "robust weighting combines the advantage offered by the natural weighting and the uniform weighting .",
    "it gives a resolution approaching that of a uniform weighting , with only a modest cost in sensitivity @xcite .",
    "after gridding the sample visibilities and performing an fft on equation [ eq : weighting ] , the obtained dirty image needs to be deconvolved to get an estimate of the true image .",
    "clean , first described by @xcite , is among the widely used algorithms for this purpose .",
    "there have been many variants of clean since its inception , most of them aiming to improve computational efficiency and performance with respect to extended structure .",
    "the original clean algorithm , also called classical clean or delta function clean , assumes that the true image brightness distribution can be well represented by a collection of point sources .",
    "the algorithm iteratively searches for the locations and strengths of the point sources and iteratively subtracts them using the shape of the dirty beam to generate a _ residual map _ and a _ clean component list_. it is common practice to convolve the clean component list with an idealized `` clean beam '' ( e.g. , usually a gaussian with a fwhm matching that of the central component of the dirty beam * ? ? ?",
    "the convolved clean component list is then added to the residual map to obtain the final restored image , which is a plausible representation of the true image .",
    "thus , the clean - ed map is a combination of two maps , imaged with two different beams .",
    "this paper explores the effects of this on measurements of the hi velocity dispersion .",
    "naively one would expect that the flux of a channel map is obtained by simply adding the flux of the cleaned map to that of the residual map : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the cleaned flux and @xmath20 is the residual flux .",
    "however , @xmath19 and @xmath20 have different units ( @xmath19 is in jy / clean beam and @xmath20 in jy / dirty beam ) and depending on the configuration of the array , the shape of the dirty beam can be strongly non - gaussian and more extended than the clean beam .",
    "this mismatch in shape between the dirty beam and the clean beam leads to an overestimate of the flux density if the clean beam parameters are used to determine the flux of sources containing both cleaned and residual emission .",
    "we illustrate in figure  [ fig : crosscut ] , how the dirty beam and the clean beam differ from each other in typical multi - configuration observations with the vla . to account for the difference in area between the clean beam and the dirty beam ,",
    "the flux of the residual must be scaled by a scaling factor @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the corrected flux and @xmath21 is a correction factor that accounts for the ratio between the clean beam area and the dirty beam area @xcite",
    ". theoretically , due to the absence of zero spacing in interferometric data , the dirty beam integral and the total flux density of the dirty image are zero as there are equal amounts of positive and negative flux in the dirty image . in practice ,",
    "the positive flux is mostly concentrated in the main lobe of the dirty beam and , for the purposes of residual - scaling , one has to choose a region ( box ) centered on the main lobe over which to integrate the dirty beam and ensure most of the flux in the main lobe is captured .",
    "the residual scaling method is included in the aips task imagr and more technical aspects are presented there .",
    "as described in @xcite , the calculation of the flux in the main lobe of the things dirty beam was done inside a box with a half - width of 50 pixels ( 75@xmath24 ) in r.a . and in dec .",
    "this box was chosen as it encompasses the larger part of the main lobe of the things dirty beam while still well within its first negative sidelobe .",
    "this choice is appropriate for all of the things galaxies as they have all been observed in the same manner and with the same set - up , meaning their dirty beams are all very similar",
    ". a quantitative analysis of the uncertainties associated with this choice of box size and with the use of a different dirty beam area has not been performed , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , initial testing prior to the reduction of the things data as presented in @xcite indicates that residual - scaling results do not critically depend on the box size ( f. walter , priv . com . ) note that the residual scaling affects the noise and thus it should only be used for flux measurements in areas with genuine emission @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the things residual - scaled cubes are blanked in areas judged to be devoid of emission .",
    "the criteria used by things is that genuine emission must be present in at least three consecutive channels at or above a level of 2@xmath25 in standard cubes convolved to 30  resolution .",
    "these cubes are then used as masks to blank areas containing only noise . while residual - scaling has been widely used to get more accurate flux values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the effects its presence or absence has on hi velocity dispersion have not yet been well explored .",
    "@xcite first noticed the difference between hi velocity dispersion derived from flux - rescaled cubes and standard cubes obtained using multi - configuration vla observations .",
    "this paper makes a thorough comparison of hi velocity dispersions derived from residual - scaled cubes and non - residual - scaled cubes from things .",
