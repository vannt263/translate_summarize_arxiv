    "cork is a contractible 4-manifold with boundary diffeomorphism ( it is called a cork map ) which never extend to the whole 4-manifold .",
    "cork plays a significant role in studying exotic 4-manifolds . `",
    "exotic ' means that the manifolds are homeomorphic but non - diffeomorphic each other .",
    "in fact , any two exotic closed 4-manifolds with @xmath4 are obtained by a cork twist , for example see @xcite .",
    "gompf in @xcite gave an infinite exotic family using infinite order corks as below .",
    "let @xmath5 be a certain 4-manifold ( having a square zero torus with two vanishing cycles ) .",
    "[ gompf ] suppose that @xmath6 is the @xmath7-twist knot .",
    "then there exists an infinite order cork @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is fintushel - stern s knot - surgery of @xmath5 by @xmath11 .",
    "order of cork is defined to be the minimal positive number whose power of the boundary diffeomorphism extends to the whole cork . for finite order corks , @xcite and @xcite",
    "are known ever . as a notation of the surgery of @xmath5 by a twist @xmath12 by embedding @xmath13 we use @xmath14 or simply @xmath15 .      the first result ( theorem  [ z2 ] ) is a construction of @xmath16-cork .",
    "the @xmath2-fold end - sum of gompf s @xmath17 has @xmath0-effective embedding into a closed 4-manifold @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the group @xmath16 acts on the exotic structures on @xmath1 effectively .",
    "the second result ( theorem  [ double2 ] ) is on the diffeomorphism type of the twisted double of gompf s @xmath17 with respect to the cork twist @xmath8 . as a result",
    "the twisted double is diffeomorphic to a log - transform along a torus in @xmath3 .",
    "the construction of gompf s infinite order corks is simple but it seems hard to distinguish the differential structures .      in @xcite gompf defined infinite order corks @xmath8 and asked in @xcite whether there exists @xmath18-cork by taking full @xmath19 action of his corks . in @xcite he partially gave a negative answer for this question .",
    "we construct a @xmath0-cork below , but it is not an answer as mentioned above question .",
    "[ z2 ] for any integer @xmath2 there exists a @xmath0-cork @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , there exists a @xmath0-effective embedding @xmath21 , where @xmath1 is a closed 4-manifold .",
    "this construction is due to performing cork twistings at distinct two clasps as mentioned by gompf in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath22 be a group acting on @xmath23 effectively .",
    "if there exists an embedding @xmath24 of @xmath25 into a 4-manifold @xmath5 such that @xmath26 is not diffeomorphic to @xmath27 for any @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , then we call the embedding @xmath24 a @xmath22-effective .",
    "this definition implies that the correspondence @xmath30 gives an injection : @xmath31 if @xmath25 has a @xmath22-effective embedding , then @xmath32 produces a @xmath22-cork .",

    "asks the following question :    for any positive integers @xmath35 and @xmath2 , is @xmath36 standard @xmath3 ?",
    "it would be much hard to prove that it is standard . in this paper",
    "we will prove that each of homotopy spheres is a log transform in @xmath3 .",
    "[ double2 ] @xmath36 is a @xmath37-log transform of @xmath3 along an embedded torus .    exchanging the roles of @xmath38 and @xmath39",

    "if the embedding of the torus in @xmath3 extends to a fishtail neighborhood , then the log transform does not change the diffeomorphism type @xcite .",
    "however this is a challenging example at the point that it is difficult to find the vanishing cycles with @xmath41-framing circle .",
    "other similar situations are in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". other examples of log transforms of @xmath3 are in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "along normally generating loops of @xmath52 the surgeries are done in @xmath50 .",

    "the general scharlemann manifold gives a homotopy @xmath53 the case where @xmath54 and the loop is the meridian of the trefoil is the original one in @xcite . the author in @xcite proved that some scharlemann manifolds are standard .",
    "there is the following natural question :    let @xmath22 be an infinite non - abelian group",
    ". then does there exists a @xmath22-cork or a @xmath22-effective embedding in a 4-manifold ?    related topics to this question will be written in a sequel .",
    "these results were inspired by the preprint @xcite and partially done during my stay at kias on march in 2016 .",
    "i am deeply grateful for the hospitality at the institute , and kyungbae park and min hoon kim .",
    "kouichi yasui gave me much advice and suggestions in the hiroshima university topology - geometry seminar .",

    "i thank them so much .",
    "before the introduction of gompf s infinite order cork , we review the definition of fintushel - stern s knot - surgery .",
    "let @xmath11 be a knot in @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a 4-manifold with a square zero embedded torus @xmath56 .",
    "then the performance @xmath57\\cup [ ( s^3-\\nu(k))\\times s^1]\\ ] ] is called a _ ( fintushel - stern s ) knot - surgery _ along @xmath11 .",
    "the gluing map is indicated in @xcite .",
    "the notation @xmath58 stands for open neighborhood of a submanifold .",
    "we remark sunukjian s work in @xcite .",
    "the paper says that fintushel - stern s knot surgeries can be distinguished by the alexander polynomial .",
    "in other words , two surgeries of an embedded torus with different alexander polynomials give different smooth structures .",
    "to distinguish the smooth structures of knot surgeries , we may consider the alexander polynomial of the knots instead of seiberg - witten invariant .      in this section",
    "we describe the diagram of gompf s infinite order cork @xmath17 . in @xcite",
    "the diagram is described by the different method .",
    "the manifold @xmath59 is diffeomorphic to @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the complement of @xmath62-double twist knot @xmath63 as in figure  1 in @xcite .",
    "the incompressible torus can be realized as an indicated torus in figure  [ diagram ] .",
    "note that in the diagram in figure  [ diagram ] you apparently can not find the embedded torus , because the torus meets the dotted 1-handles 4 times .",
    "however , by inserting 2 pairs of canceling 2/3-handles , we can avoid the intersections .",
    "thus by the fundamental method of handle calculus , the picture of the cylinder @xmath65 is the right diagram . attaching the @xmath66-framed 2-handle ( @xmath67-framed 2-handle on another side respectively ) and removing the union of the core and the attaching sphere cross interval @xmath68",
    ", we have the other handle attachment and removal in figure  [ diagram ] .",
    "the two 0-framed 2-handles in figure  [ diagram ] are canceled out with the 3-handles when removing the cores . in the similar situation to here is @xcite .",
    "hence , the cork @xmath33 produces a knot - surgery @xmath10 by fintushel and stern in @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is a 4-manifold with a certain condition .",
    "then there exists an embedding @xmath71 such that @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "suppose that @xmath96 . if @xmath97 and @xmath98 hold , then , comparing the top degrees we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "if either @xmath101 or @xmath102 is 0 and the other is not 0 , then the two polynomials do not agree clearly . if @xmath103 , then , comparing the top degrees we have @xmath100 .",
    "thus , @xmath2 copies of @xmath65 in @xmath110 are disjoint . attaching @xmath111 ( @xmath41-framed ) 2-handles on @xmath110",
    "are embedded in @xmath112 , because it has @xmath113 vanishing cycles . removing the @xmath114 union of the core disks in the 2-handles and attaching spheres times @xmath68 , we have @xmath2 disjoint embedded @xmath17 s in @xmath1 .",
    "we take each point in the complements of the incompressible tori in @xmath115 and embed a 1-handle connecting the two points in @xmath1 minus @xmath2 @xmath17 s .",
    "embedding such @xmath116 1-handles , we construct @xmath117 .",
    "since those points are taken in the complement of the incompressible tori , @xmath64 also acts on @xmath118 .",
    "let @xmath119 be a diffeomorphism on @xmath120 which acts as the gompf s @xmath64 on the @xmath24-th component of @xmath118 and acts as the identity on the other component of @xmath121 .",
    "the two maps @xmath119 and @xmath122 are commutative because the region which the action is supporting is disjoint each other .",
    "the twist @xmath123 of @xmath1 produces @xmath124 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath125 @xmath126 comparing the degrees of the two results , the two seiberg - witten invariants do not agree , unless @xmath127 for any @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath124 are exotic when @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath123 gives an exotic @xmath129 .",
    "thus , @xmath123 is a cork .",
    "this means that @xmath130 is a @xmath0-cork .          by the induction of the number @xmath2 in ( [ eq1 ] ) we prove this claim .",
    "let @xmath137 be the elementary symmetric polynomial with degree @xmath24 in @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively .",
    "let @xmath140 be the degree of ( [ eq1 ] ) . comparing the degree @xmath140 of ( [ eq1 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath141 . in the same way , for @xmath142 comparing the degree @xmath143 in ( [ eq1 ] ) , we have @xmath144 .",
    "further , comparing the degree @xmath145 , we have @xmath146 holds .",
    "namely , @xmath147 holds . by replacing @xmath2 with @xmath116 , we do the similar argument .",
    "our proof reduces to the case of @xmath148 .",
    "if @xmath149 , then by seeing the top coefficient , we have @xmath147 . by dividing @xmath150 in ( [ eq1 ] ) , the argument reduces to the case of the product of @xmath116 polynomials . therefore the required assertion is proved .",
    "from the claim above , the set of alexander polynomials of @xmath104 for @xmath151 is distinct .",
    "this means the set is parametrized by @xmath0 .",
    "this follows that an embedding @xmath152 is @xmath0-effective .",
    "the images by @xmath64 of meridians of 4 2-handles in figure  [ diagram ] are the link @xmath154 and @xmath155 in figure  [ zz ] .",
    "this diagram is the @xmath148 case . in the general @xmath2 case ,",
    "the images of the meridians of the 2-handles by @xmath74 are @xmath156 and @xmath155 in figure  [ zzk ] .",
    "we give a proof of fact  [ double2 ] . before the proof we give a brief review of the @xmath158-log",
    "let @xmath159 be an embedded torus with square 0 in a 4-manifold @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath160 be a curve presenting a generator on the homology of @xmath19 .",
    "suppose that the gluing diffeomorphism @xmath161 satisfies @xmath162 then we call the twist @xmath163 _ @xmath158-log transform _ with direction @xmath160 .",
    "when @xmath160 is clear in the context , we omit the suffix .",
    "the @xmath166-log transform is given by the figure  [ zz4 ] .",
    "in general @xmath37-log transform is the @xmath39-times iteration of this process .",
    "hence @xmath36 is the @xmath37-log transform of @xmath167 .",
    "since the knot @xmath168 is isotopic to the unknot , @xmath169 is the standard 4-ball .",
    "thus @xmath167 is diffeomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath43 is two dots and two 0 s exchange sub - handle for @xmath164 along the tori .",
