    "the qualitative and quantitative study of genuinely quantum correlations in multipartite states is nowadays one of the most central and debated topics in quantum information science , involving both theoretical and experimental lines of research @xcite . satisfactorily addressing when and to what extent a quantum system exhibits a departure from a purely classical behavior , and defining reliable signatures of its quantumness , is crucial to achieve a deeper insight on the foundations of quantum mechanics , on the quantum - to - classical transition in complex systems and living organisms @xcite , and might open the way to novel technological developments in quantum engineering , communication and information processing @xcite .",
    "while the quantum character of a pure state is conclusively revealed by a bell inequality violation , or by its resource character for protocols such as teleportation , mixed states entail a more involved yet exciting case where nonclassicality , nonlocality and entanglement do not necessarily coincide . even highly mixed states with little or no entanglement can be useful for quantum computing , thus displaying strong signatures of quantumness in the form of nonclassical correlations beyond entanglement  @xcite . in an attempt to characterize such correlations and understand their role ,",
    "several measures were proposed to pinpoint the various facets of nonclassicality  @xcite . among them ,",
    "the increasingly popular _ quantum discord _",
    "@xcite and the more easily computable _ measurement - induced disturbance _ ( mid )  @xcite have attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "whilst the theory of entanglement has been amply developed , leading to a set of well motivated requirements that any _ bona fide _ entanglement measure should satisfy  @xcite , a similar formal backbone is missing for general nonclassicality indicators .",
    "this leaves room for the drawing of physically incorrect conclusions about the nature of correlations in a quantum state , should inappropriate measures be employed . to render the paradigm of quantum correlations beyond entanglement widely accessible and appealing experimentally , and be able to reveal truly quantum rather than classical features in laboratory systems",
    ", one should first identify those quantifiers of quantum correlations that are _ faithful _ , namely vanishing on all _ classical - classical _ states @xcite ( classical probability distributions embedded in a density matrix ) , and avoid the use of unfaithful ones .",
    "desirable requirements for a quantum correlation measure would further be its symmetry with respect to swapping the subsystems ( correlations should not depend on which party is probed ) and its vanishing _ only _ on classical - classical states ( strong faithfulness ) .    in this paper , motivated by these premises ,",
    "we assess the characterization of quantum correlations focusing on the paradigmatic instance of ( generally mixed ) two - qubit states .",
    "we first deploy a quantitative benchmarking test of quantum discord and mid as tools to investigate the interplay between quantum correlations and global state mixedness .",
    "we find that the nonoptimized nature of mid @xcite makes such indicator unfaithful , being nonzero and even maximal on some classical - classical states . on the other hand , due to its asymmetric definition @xcite , discord is not strongly faithful @xcite , as it does not reliably detect the fine discrimination between classical - classical and so - called _ classical - quantum _ states @xcite , which still possess some quantum correlations , but exhibit zero discord .",
    "we thus propose to employ in general an _ ameliorated _ version of mid as a measure of quantum correlations , which we refer to as `` amid '' , operatively associated to the minimal state disturbance upon joint local measurements ( in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite ) . amid",
    "is symmetric by construction , plays a clear role as quantum complement to the ` classical mutual information ' @xcite , provides a tight upper bound to discord , and vanishes on and only on all classical - classical states , yielding a strongly faithful quantification of quantum correlations .",
    "notably , we provide an analytical recipe to evaluate amid on general two - qubit states , which leads to closed formulas for some relevant families of states .",
    "reaching beyond the recent efforts of refs .",
    "@xcite , and inspired by an analogous earlier study of maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) @xcite , we furthermore identify and characterize rigorously the _ maximally quantum - correlated mixed states _ of two qubits at given values of the global von neumann entropy . in the entropic plane , discord and amid admit exactly the same ( rather structured ) set of universal extremal states , that collectively embody the maximal robustness of two - qubit quantum correlations against decoherence .",
    "our investigation sheds unforeseen light onto a topic of vast theoretical and practical interest .",
    "the families of extremal states identified here can be experimentally engineered by means of light - atom interfaces  @xcite or all - optical setups , and the quantum correlations can be directly measured in laboratory via suitable local detections or computed from the tomographically reconstructed density matrices @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secmq ] we define discord and mid and explore their distribution as a function of the global state mixedness ( von neumann entropy ) for general two - qubit states .",
    "we identify the maximally quantum - correlated mixed states of two qubits , and highlight sharp unfaithful features of the mid measure . in sec .",
    "[ secamid ] we introduce the amid and study its properties , providing analytical progresses on its evaluation for relevant two - qubit states .",
    "a comparison between the three nonclassicality indicators is presented and reveals how the amid admits the same extremal states as discord at fixed global entropy .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "let us fist introduce two of the nonclassicality indicators studied in our paper .",
    "ollivier and zurek associate quantum discord to the discrepancy between two classically equivalent versions of mutual information .",
    "the latter is a widely accepted measure of total correlations , defined , for a bipartite quantum state @xmath0 , as @xmath1 . here ,",
    "@xmath2 $ ] is the von neumann entropy ( vne ) of the arbitrary two - qubit state @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the reduced density matrix of party @xmath5 .",
    "alternatively , one can consider the expression @xmath6 ( the one - way classical correlation @xcite ) with @xmath7 the quantum conditional entropy associated with the the post - measurement density matrix @xmath8/p_i$ ] obtained upon performing the complete projective measurement @xmath9 on system @xmath10 ( @xmath11 $ ] ) .",
    "quantum discord is thus defined as @xmath12\\,,\\ ] ] where the infimum is calculated over the set of projectors @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "discord is , in general , asymmetric as @xmath14 with @xmath15 obtained by swapping the roles of a and b. no closed formulas are known for @xmath16 on general two - qubit states , other than special cases @xcite .",
    "luo introduced mid starting from the observation that a bipartite state containing no quantum correlations commutes with the operators describing any complete projective measurement  @xcite . on the other hand , although a state @xmath0 may be intrinsically nonclassical , any complete bi - local projective measurement makes it classical as a result of a decoherence - by - measurement process  @xcite .",
    "mid is thus defined by restricting the attention to the complete projective measurement @xmath17 determined by the eigen - projectors @xmath18 of @xmath4  ( @xmath19 ) and reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the state resulting from the application of @xmath22 .",
    "we begin our analysis by investigating quantum correlations versus global state mixedness ( vne ) for two qubits , looking in particular for the families of extremal states @xcite .",
    "we have generated up to @xmath23 random two - qubit density matrices , uniformly in the space of hermitian , positive semidefinite matrices , and for each of them we have evaluated @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( analytically ) and @xmath16 ( numerically ) .",
    "most notably , although our study has been performed using unconstrained density matrices , we have found that the so - called @xmath26 states of the form @xmath27 allow us to span the whole physically - allowed regions of the planes studied in this work , boundaries included .",
    "we will thus use the states in eq .",
    "( [ xstates ] ) as our starting ansatz to seek analytical candidates for extremality .",

    "the problem can be solved analytically and the resulting boundary states are presented in the following .",
    "let us define three subfamilies of states : the rank-3 class @xmath39 encompassing the mems for the relative entropy of entanglement  @xcite , the werner states @xmath40 , and a two - parameter family @xmath41 studied in  @xcite .",

    "we observe an intricate profile of extremally `` discordant '' two - qubit states at set vne , far more structured than any instance of mems  @xcite , thus showing the nontrivial relation between quantum correlations and global state mixedness .",
    "let us now address a similar study when mid is used as a nonclassicality indicator .",
    "we aim at finding whether mid could be effective in providing a simpler yet meaningful picture of the behavior of quantum correlations in two - qubit mixed states . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figrandom](b ) , we find indeed that the physically allowed region in the @xmath25-vs-@xmath24 plane simplifies to a trapezium , whose upper extremity is spanned by two different extremal families only .",

    "quite strikingly , however , the boundary state @xmath53 and all the @xmath54 s on the oblique edge of the trapezium have strictly @xmath55 and are thus classical - classical : mid clearly overestimates quantum correlations , failing to meet the essential faithfulness requirement .    to confirm this , we plot in fig .",
    "[ figomid](a ) the distribution of mid versus discord for random two - qubit states . here",
    "we consider the `` two - way '' discord @xmath56 $ ] , to ensure its vanishing only for classical - classical states ( while it can be @xmath57 but @xmath58 on classical - quantum states @xcite , as discord is not strongly faithful ) .",

    "the two indicators coincide on pure and werner states , which span the lower boundary of the triangular region in fig .",
    "[ figomid](a ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath59 yields the upper boundary at @xmath49 , while the vertical side at @xmath60 accommodates classical - classical states ( e.g.  @xmath29 ) , yet with nonzero mid up to its maximum value @xcite .",

    "the evident overestimation given by mid , which is a consequence of the ` rigidity ' of the projective bases used in its definition ( as already pointed out in @xcite ) urges us to look for a more faithful figure of merit .",
    "the natural next step is to consider an _ ameliorated _ version of the measurement - induced disturbance ( or amid ) where arbitrary complete projective measurements can be performed , locally , on parties @xmath64 and @xmath10 , and a subsequent optimization over any possible set of local projectors is achieved .",
    "we thus define amid , for bipartite systems of any dimension , as @xmath65={\\cal i}(\\varrho_{ab})-{\\cal i}_c(\\varrho_{ab}),\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is an arbitrary complete ( bi - local ) projective measurement over the composite system ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are not necessarily made out of eigen - projectors and the search for the infimum over the set of @xmath70 s entails the nontrivial optimization missing in mid @xcite .",
    "our definition is further motivated by the earlier analyses discussed in  @xcite , where @xmath71 in  eq .",
    "( [ mida ] ) is recognized as the _ classical mutual information _ ( optimized over projective measurements ) , a proper symmetric measure of classical correlations in bipartite states . amid",
    "is thus recast as the difference between total and classical mutual information , which has all the good prerequisites to be a _ bona fide _ measure of quantum correlations @xcite . from an operational point of view",
    ", the amid can be interpreted as a measure of the `` infidelity '' of local broadcasting , a primitive task that can only be accomplished perfectly with classical - classical states @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ mida ] ) involves solving a nontrivial double - optimization problem .",
    "however , for two qubits the techniques of refs .",
    "@xcite enable us to streamline the formal apparatus needed for the quantification of amid .",
    "any two - qubit state can be transformed by local unitaries ( that leave amid invariant by definition ) into the form @xmath72/4 $ ] with @xmath73 and @xmath74 the single - qubit bloch vectors and @xmath75 a correlation vector .",
    "any projector @xmath76 for subsystem @xmath5 , on the other hand , can be written as @xmath77 with @xmath78 a unitary matrix such that @xmath79 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "after some operator algebra , one has @xmath80 , where the vectors @xmath81 ( depending solely on @xmath82 ) are defined by the relation @xmath83 , and @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "it is then convenient to introduce the new set of variables @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 and define @xmath89 . by formulating and solving the conditions for stationarity of @xmath90 , as well as studying its behavior at the boundary of the parameter space",
    ", we finally find that there are at least two candidates for the global infimum in eq .",
    "( [ mida ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain for amid the following general upper bound @xmath91\\,.\\ ] ] for the relevant class of @xmath26 states [ eq .",

    "( [ mida ] ) ] , and thus complementing the results of refs .",
    "@xcite on discord .",
    "crucially , the above analysis allows us to perform a complete amid - vs - vne study and investigate relations between mid , amid and discord .    to begin with",
    ", we find quantitatively that @xmath92 the rightmost bound is obvious by definition , whereas the leftmost one holds as @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "this establishes an important _ hierarchy _ of quantumness indicators . while a plot of un - optimized - mid - vs - amid turns out to be totally analogous to the mid - vs - discord one [ fig .",
    "[ figomid](a ) ] , more interesting conclusions can be drawn from the exploration of the @xmath90-vs-@xmath94 plane , whose results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figomid](b ) .",
    "first , werner states ( as well as pure states ) still embody the lower - most boundary ( where @xmath95 ) .",
    "second , as a consequence of the optimizations in its definition , amid is a tighter upper bound to discord , occupying a much smaller area of the region above the werner bound . finally ( and most importantly ) there is no zero - discord state with nonzero amid : the lower and upper boundaries to the physically meaningful region in the @xmath90-vs-@xmath94 plane are conjoined at the origin .",
    "this provides a clearcut confirmation that amid is a _ strongly faithful _ measure of genuinely quantum correlations , which vanishes if and only if a state is classical - classical @xcite , is furthermore intrinsically symmetric , and can be then adopted as a rightfully valid and well motivated alternative to quantum discord .",
    "the states on the upper boundary in the @xmath90-vs-@xmath94 plane can be found again using the lagrange multiplier method @xcite .",
    "we conclude by studying amid vs vne for arbitrary two - qubit random states .",
    "most notably [ see fig .",
    "[ figrandom](c ) ] , the physically allowed region in the @xmath96 plane is found precisely congruent to the one in the @xmath97 one [ fig .",
    "[ figrandom](a ) ] and admits _ the same _ boundaries [ table [ azz ] ] ( for those states , @xmath98 ) .",
    "we can thus promote the interpretation of the set of states in table  [ azz ] as _ universal _ two - qubit mqcms , being simultaneously extremal for discord and amid , at fixed vne .",
    "this highlights a fascinating connection between such entropic nonclassicality indicators , that impose inequivalent orderings on partially nonclassical states , but yield identical prescriptions for extremality .",
    "we performed some significant steps towards the proper distinction between classical and quantum correlations in composite quantum systems .",
    "our starting point was a self - contained investigation of the structure of quantum correlations in two - qubit entropic spaces using the most widespread `` measures '' of nonclassicality , namely discord @xcite and mid @xcite .",
    "going beyond a mere hierarchical state classification , our analysis naturally led to the proposal of adopting amid , a general strongly faithful quantum correlation quantifier linked to minimal state - disturbance after optimized local measurements @xcite , and amounting to the quantum counterpart of the classical mutual information @xcite .",
    "we explicitly computed amid on @xmath26 states and provided an exact upper bound ( conjectured to be tight based on numerical evidence ) on amid for general two - qubit states , unveiling interesting connections between amid and discord , that include the sharing of the same set of extremal states ( mqcms ) in the von neumann entropic plane .",
    "the mqcms can be rightfully regarded as the two - qubit states whose quantum correlations are maximally robust against state mixedness , and are thus set to play a key role in realistic ( noisy ) implementations of quantum information schemes based on nonclassicality of correlations as a resource @xcite , such as the `` deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit '' @xcite . in this respect , we remark that the engineering of mqcms is feasible via both atom - light interfaces and all - optical setups  @xcite , which adds an appealing feature of experimental demonstrability to our work .",
    "our methods can be extended to faithfully investigate quantum correlations in higher dimensional systems .",
    "very recently , a comparative study of discord , mid , and amid has been reported for two - mode gaussian states of continuous variable systems @xcite .",
    "we hope that our findings will motivate the search for direct detection schemes for amid in the context of quantum communication for general bipartite quantum systems , amenable of practical verification .    _",
