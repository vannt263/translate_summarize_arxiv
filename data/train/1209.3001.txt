    "<S> an unexpected insensitivity of the fermi surface to impurity scattering is found in ru substituted bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 from first - principles theory , offering a natural explanation of the unusual resilience of transport and superconductivity to a high level of disordered substitution in this material . </S>",
    "<S> this robustness is shown to originate from a coherent interference of correlated on - site and inter - site impurity scattering , similar in spirit to the microscopic mechanism of superdiffusion in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> our result also demonstrates a strong substitution dependence of the fermi surface and carrier concentration , and provides a natural resolution to current discrepancies in recent photoelectron spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> these effects offer a natural explanation of the diminishing long - range magnetic , orbital and superconducting order with high substitution .    </S>",
    "<S> utf8bsmi    chemical substitution is the most widely employed technique to induce high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious effects of substitution are carrier doping and chemical pressure . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , such substitution should also introduce disordered impurity scattering , an effect mostly unexplored in the studies of electronic structure of real materials due to its complexity . </S>",
    "<S> recently , owing to an advances in first - principles theoretical methods  @xcite , various novel and surprising physical effects of disorder were found in the new fe - based superconductors containing transition metal dopants  @xcite and fe vacancies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , one would wonder whether there are also unexpected disorder effects in isovalent substitution . </S>",
    "<S> an ideal candidate to investigate is the ru substituted fe - based superconductor ba(fe@xmath1ru@xmath2as@xmath3(ru122 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unlike other existing cases with isovalent substitution at the anion sites , ru atoms replaces the most essential fe atoms . given that ru is a 4d element , it must be quite different chemically from 3d fe and therefore must introduce a strong impurity scattering potential .    </S>",
    "<S> one obvious physical puzzle regarding ru122 is the resilience of its superconductivity and transport against large concentration of disordered impurities . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , samples are found to retain their superconductivity even with 40% ru substitution of fe  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given the current proposal that the superconducting order parameter is most likely of @xmath4 symmetry  @xcite , it is extremely puzzling how a sign - changing order parameter can survive such a large concentration of strong impurities . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , given that ru is more distinct from fe than co is , it is quite unexpected that ru substituted samples exhibit a residual resistivity comparable to 8% co substituted system  @xciteat a much higher 35% substitution level . </S>",
    "<S> another important current issue is the ru substitution dependence of the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively similar to the co substituted systems , ru substitution at high enough level systematically suppresses the magnetic , orbital order , and then superconductivity . for co substituted systems , this behavior can be understood from the weakening of the nesting between the electron and hole pockets , since the former grow in size while the latter shrink , responding to the additional doped carriers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for ru substitution , however , the size of the electron and hole pockets should remain balanced ( and approximately nested ) , since ru is supposed to be isovalent to fe . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus not as obvious what substitution - dependent features in the electronic structure suppress the long - range order in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> currently , this issue is quite controversial in the field , due to seemingly contradictory experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> some angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments  @xcite reported a nearly substitution - independent fermi surface , and suggested that superconductivity emerges from dilution of the magnetism , in contrast to other doped 122 systems . </S>",
    "<S> other arpes measurements , on the other hand , reported a large increase of the number of carriers  @xcite with increasing ru concentration and a crossover from two - dimensional to three - dimensional structure of some of the hole - like fermi surfaces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar contradictions also emerge in current first - principles computations . </S>",
    "<S> some concluded that ru substitution induces no doping  @xcite and no changes in the low energy band structure  @xcite , while others  @xcite found large changes . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus timely to investigate the substitution - dependence of the electronic structure of ru122 with a proper account of the disorder effects to resolve the current debates , and if possible to offer an explanation for the suppression of long - range magnetic , orbital and superconducting order upon increased substitution levels .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we address these important issues by studying the electronic structure of ba(fe@xmath1ru@xmath5)@xmath0as@xmath0 over the full range of substitution ( @xmath6 ) taking into account the realistic disorder effects in first - principles calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this is made possible via the recently developed wannier function based effective hamiltonian method for disordered systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , while large scattering is found on the entire fe band complex , for all substitution levels , the states near the chemical potential remain very sharp and coherent . </S>",
    "<S> this unexpected insensitivity of the quasiparticles to impurity scattering is here traced back to a coherent interference between on - site and off - site impurity effects . in spirit , this is very similar to the microscopic mechanism that gives rise to superdiffusion in 1d theory  @xcite , and can thus be considered as the first realization of this exotic phenomenon in real materials .    </S>",
    "<S> this insensitivity to impurity scattering provides a natural explanation of the amazing resilience of transport and superconductivity in the presence of a high level of fe site substitution in this specific material . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our results reproduce the measured spectral functions and resolve the current controversy in the interpretations of the ru substitution dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we find a systematic reduction of carrier density upon ru substitution accompanied by an enhanced 3d character of the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> these effects lead naturally to suppression of long - range magnetic and superconducting order at high substitution level . </S>",
    "<S> these findings highlight the general need to incorporate disorder effects in most chemically substituted systems .        </S>",
    "<S> we first evaluate the configuration - averaged spectral function @xmath7 of wannier orbital @xmath8 , frequency @xmath9 , and crystal momentum @xmath10 , within the approach of ref . , and with the help of the band structure unfolding method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath7 is found converged within the resolution of the plots after averaging over 10 large randomly - shaped supercells containing 400 atoms on average with random ru substitutions . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of ru substitution on the hamiltonian is extracted from the results of several density function theory ( dft ) calculations : the undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 or baru@xmath0as@xmath0 , as well as the impurity supercells of ba@xmath0fe@xmath11ruas@xmath12 or ba@xmath0feru@xmath11as@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy hilbert space is taken within [ -6,4 ] ev consisting of wannier orbitals of fe-@xmath14 , ru-@xmath14 and as-@xmath15 characters . </S>",
    "<S> careful benchmarks of the quality of our effective hamiltonian are conducted against full dft calculations using stoichiometric ordered  impurity lattice \" test cases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the entire study is conducted using the 2-fe brillouin zone required by the symmetry  @xcite , and unfolded to the 1-fe zone  @xcite when direct comparison with arpes spectra is needed .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig1 ] summarizes our resulting spectral functions over the entire range of substitution for ba(fe@xmath1ru@xmath16)@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . a clear broadening of quasiparticle spectral lines in both momentum and frequency </S>",
    "<S> is observed over the entire fe @xmath14-band complex , reflecting the finite mean free path and lifetime of carriers in these states due to disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening is naturally the strongest for the @xmath19 case , since it is the most disordered one shown . </S>",
    "<S> ( as @xmath20 approaches 0 or 1 , the system starts to become cleaner , approaching the pure end compounds . ) </S>",
    "<S> such a strong impurity scattering is expected , since the 4d level of ru is about 0.8 ev lower in energy than the 3d level of fe , and the different spatial extent of the orbitals also implies large changes in their hopping strength .    </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , the bands near the fermi level ( shown in the second panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) remain very sharp , as if carriers occupying states near the fermi level do nt scatter from the impurity . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the configurational averaged spectral function [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ] exhibits a very sharp peak at the fermi level with a well - defined dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> ( in comparison , around @xmath21 ev the spectral function shows a much broader peak , reflecting strong impurity scattering effects . ) therefore , the puzzling resilience of transport and superconductivity against high substitution level in ru122 is now understandable simply from the lack of net impurity scattering for states near the fermi level .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b)-(d ) give further insights into the microscopic origin of this unusual insensitivity to disorder near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> here we compare spectral functions under the influence of different partial components of the impurity potential in the wannier function basis . with only the diagonal impurity potential </S>",
    "<S> ( on - site disorder ) , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c ) shows a strong smearing of the entire @xmath14-band complex , including states near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , with only the off - diagonal impurity potential ( off - site disorder ) , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](d ) shows a well structured smearing of the band structure : the farther away from the center of the @xmath14-bands , the more the states are affected by the impurity . in particular , near the center of the band , the effects of the off - site impurity potential diminishes . </S>",
    "<S> this is understandable since the off - site terms of the hamiltonian are responsible for the band dispersion , and their effects is maximum at the band edges . </S>",
    "<S> one would expect a similar structure for the effectiveness of off - site impurity potential , particularly positive / negative above / below the center of the band . </S>",
    "<S> ( the ru orbital is bigger than fe , so the impurity potential tends to enhance the band width . ) </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion can be reached by imagining the band structure interpolated between pure bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and pure baru@xmath0as@xmath0 .    upon combining both on - site and off - site disorder potential , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) shows that the energy range with weak impurity scattering moves up , close to the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> this can now be understood as a consequence of the cancelation of ( negative ) on - site and ( positive ) off - site impurity potential above the center of the band . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](e ) gives an example of the net coupling involving 8th/7th and 9th/10th bands near the @xmath22 point resulting from a single impurity for all three cases . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that near the fermi level , the impurity scattering between 9th and 10th bands has large on - site contribution ( similar to that between 8th and 7th bands ) , but it is almost entirely canceled by the equally large off - site scattering . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that such coherent interference can only take place because the positions of on - site and off - site impurity potential are always correlated : both are associated with the location of ru substitution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , moving the impurity position only adds the same overall phase to both of the terms but does not affect their interference .    </S>",
    "<S> this effect is in spirit very similar to the microscopic mechanism that gives rise to the unusual superdiffusion in 1d models  @xcite . due to the poor connection between sites , ( non - interacting ) 1d systems </S>",
    "<S> are known to be extremely sensitive to disorder . </S>",
    "<S> any tiny on - site disorder leads immediately to a total localization of the system . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , it can be shown  @xcite that the system can still overcome the localization to give a `` superdiffusive '' metallic transport if certain special correlations exists in the position of the impurities to ensure a coherent interference of their scattering . </S>",
    "<S> what we find here in ru122 is probably a more general ( and realistic ) case , in which the interference takes place at a single impurity , but between on - site and off - site contributions . from this point of view , </S>",
    "<S> ru122 can thus be considered the first realization of such an exotic superdiffusion mechanism in real materials . </S>",
    "<S> this realization manifests itself with a significant consequence that superconductivity survives to a high substitution level , due to the insensitivity of states near the chemical potential to the impurity scattering . </S>",
    "<S> in general , similar interference should occur in some other materials with disordered impurities as well , since realistic impurity induced on - site and off - site effects are always correlated in position . </S>",
    "<S> this might also explain why metallic transport can be found in some thin nanowires  @xcite and quasi-1d materials  @xcite , despite the unavoidable occurrence of disorder .    </S>",

    "<S> ( e ) single - impurity induced coupling between the bloch orbitals near and far from the chemical potential , indicated by the black and red segments in ( d ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> next , considering ru substitution dependence of the electronic structure , fig .  1 show several clear trends . </S>",
    "<S> first , the hole pockets in the center of the brillouin zone becomes more three - dimensional , shrinking significantly in size in the @xmath24 plane and eventually disappearing , while surviving in the @xmath25 plane . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the pocket with large @xmath26 character shows the strongest 3d dispersion , growing in size in the @xmath25 plane . on the other hand , the electron pockets near the corner of the zone shows only a slight substitution dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this large change is quite consistent with the recent arpes observation  @xcite , but _ seems _ to contradict the earlier observation of substitution independent fermi surface  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy can , in fact , be easily resolved by accounting for the matrix element of the incident photon in the experiment  @xcite . the photon polarization used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is along the @xmath27 direction , which couples mostly to the @xmath28 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> figure  3 shows the @xmath28 character of our theoretical unfolded band structure  @xcite , showing little change upon ru substitution at the @xmath25 plane , in excellent agreement with the experiment .     </S>",
    "<S> plane between the arpes results  @xcite ( top panel ) and our results ( bottom panel ) in 1-fe zone for different ru concentration @xmath29 0.02 ( a ) , 0.21 ( b ) , 0.36 ( c ) and 0.55 ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines marks the true 2-fe brillouin zone boundaries . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the second physical effect of ru substitution revealed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 is an physical reduction of carrier density , a real doping effect , and correspondingly a reduction of the density of states ( dos ) at the chemical potential . in typical systems with only one sign of carriers , carrier doping </S>",
    "<S> is typically achieved via substitution of different valence . here , ru substitution , while typically considered isovalent , actually reduces the carrier concentration significantly , from 0.16/fe at @xmath30 to 0.12/fe at @xmath31 , about a 25% reduction ( c.f . bottom of fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> ) this takes places through reducing the 3d volume of both the electron and the hole pockets ( while keeping charge neutrality ) , as if the system is being drained of both electron and hole simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> microscopically , this originates from a larger splitting between the conduction and valence bands , due to the enhanced hopping via ru substituted sites . </S>",
    "<S> such chemical `` pressure '' effects should survive the mass renormalization observed in real materials .    our result , which is perfectly consistent with the recent arpes measurement  @xcite , suggests a more complex picture . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we found that the green @xmath26 pocket increases in size at @xmath32 upon ru substitution , as observed experimentally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the total volume of the hole pockets ( or equivalently that of the electron pockets ) actually reduces , as reflected in the corresponding carrier density shown at the bottom of fig .  1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above substitution dependence of the electronic structure corresponds nicely to the overall features in the phase diagram of this material , from the standard weak coupling perspective . both the enhanced 3d nature and the reduced dos tend to suppress the long - range magneic / orbital order , and eventually the superconductivity with sufficient high substitution level ( the `` overdoped '' regime . ) indeed </S>",
    "<S> , the enhanced 3d band structure weakens the nesting condition for magnetic / orbital correlation , and presumably the glue for superconductivity in the `` overdoped '' regime . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the smaller dos reduces the fermi surface instability in both the magnetic , orbital , and pairing channels . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , the case of ru substitution offers a unique test case with strong substitution dependence of the electronic structure but without tipping the balance between electron and hole pockets . </S>",
    "<S> this unique feature of ru122 should serve as a good qualitative benchmark for all proposed theories of superconductivity .    in summary , a remarkable insensitivity of the states near the chemical potential to disordered impurity scattering is found in ba(fe@xmath1ru@xmath2as@xmath3 , despite the strong impurity potential of ru . </S>",
    "<S> this offers a natural explanation of the unusual resilience of transport and superconductivity against a high impurity level . </S>",
    "<S> this exotic behavior originates from a coherent interference of on - site and off - site disorder potential , and thus can be considered the first realization of super - diffusion mechanism in real materials . </S>",
    "<S> our result , while being very consistent with existing arpes measurement , resolves a few current discrepancies in the field , and leads to new physical conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , ru substitution is found to physically reduce the carrier density , instead of being `` iso - valent '' . </S>",
    "<S> our findings offer a natural explanation of the diminishing long - range magnetic , orbital and superconducting order at high substitution level .    </S>",
