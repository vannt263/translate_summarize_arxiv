    "damped ly@xmath2 ( dla ) systems are absorption systems observed in quasar spectra characterized by large column densities ( @xmath13(hi)@xmath14 2@xmath15 @xmath16 ) .",
    "they span the whole epoch of galaxy formation and are generally considered the progenitors of the present day galaxies .",
    "dla systems are of particular interest because it is possible to measure a variety of chemical elements in their interstellar gas - phase with unprecedented precision ( lu et al .",
    "1996 ; prochaska & wolfe 1999 ; pettini et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 and 2000 ) . however , the observed abundance patterns in the dlas proved difficult to account for , due to the possibility that a significant fraction of some elements contribute to dust grain formation thus depleting the gas phase abundances ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1997 ; vladilo 1998 ) . at face value the observed si ,",
    "s , cr , al , ni abundances relative to fe are similar to those observed in the old stellar population of the galaxy , with the notable exception of zn which is overabundant compared to iron . however , if the [ zn / fe ] _ anomaly _ is interpreted as a fe depletion in the interstellar medium , the observed abundance pattern would be similar to those observed in the warm phase of the interstellar medium with solar chemical composition .",
    "zinc has not been considered a totally reliable element by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , because of its uncertain nucleosynthesis .",
    "a sample of chemical elements larger than those presently available , and in particular of elements with little affinity with dust grains , is required to better address the kind of chemical pattern present in dlas .",
    "in this paper we report on the detection of uv lines of the non - depleted species  neutral argon ari and singly - ionized phosphorus pii  in a damped ly@xmath2 absorption ( dla ) system at @xmath3= 3.3901 towards the quasar q  00002620 . so far , phosphorus has been measured by outram et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in the dla at @xmath3=2.625 towards gb 1759 + 7539 and an upper limit on phosphorus abundance has been set for the dla at @xmath3= 2.309 towards phl  957",
    "( molaro et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a possible identification of the ari lines in the @xmath3= 2.8112 damped ly@xmath2 system towards pks  0528250 was reported by srianand & petitjean ( 1998 ) , however , in their spectrum the ari lines were considerably contaminated by hydrogen absorption which yields a rather uncertain ari column density .",
    "the ar we derive here is the first one ever obtained in any dla and one of the few values measured by means of unsaturated lines unlike with the interstellar studies in the galaxy ( e.g. sofia & jenkins 1998 ) .",
    "being a noble gas with very low condensation temperature , @xmath17  k ( spitzer & jenkins 1975 ) , neutral argon atoms do not form chemical bonds with solid compounds , and the depletion of phosphorus is found to be very small in the ism where variations in refractory elements do occur ( e.g. dufton et al .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio in the dla at z@xmath18=3.3901 towards qso 0000 - 2620 was found to be less than 0.2% than that in the milky way ( levshakov et al .",
    "2000b ) , and thus the measured [ ar / h ] and [ p / h ] ratios @xmath19 - \\log\\,[n({\\rm x})/n({\\rm h})]_\\odot$ ] ] at @xmath3= 3.3901 should not be significantly affected by dust depletion , thus providing a unique probe of pure nucleosynthetic yields at high redshift .",
    "the study of phosphorus may eventually allow to clarify the dust formation processes in dla galaxies .",
    "since p and fe have nearly the same condensation temperature @xmath20  k , these species should deplete together in equal proportions if dust is produced in dense and hot shells of supernova remnants where thermodynamic calculations of condensation are appropriate . a possible disparity between p and fe gas - phase abundances",
    "would favour a different model where the dust grains grow in the interstellar medium ( see jura & york 1978 , and references therein ) .",
    "we discuss here the implications of the ar and p abundances in connection with the chemical evolution of such damped galaxies .",
    "we underline that for research on the element production history , ar is a quite unique element due to its ability of tracing how strongly the apparent abundances of other species from hi regions could be influenced by ionization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in   2 we briefly describe observations and analyze ari and pii profiles .",
    "the results on ar and p abundances are discussed in ",
    "3 ( sections 3.1 and 3.2 , respectively ) . in section  3.3 , the estimations of the mean gas density and the linear size of the @xmath3= 3.3901 system are also given .",
    "conclusions are summarized in   4 .",
    "the dla at @xmath3= 3.3901 towards qso  00002620 shows high neutral hydrogen column density @xmath21 @xmath16 ( lu et al .",
    "1996 ) . this system has been studied extensively since it is one of the highest redshift dlas seen in the light of a relatively bright qso ( levshakov et al .",

    "the spectra of qso  00002620 were obtained during the first commissioning of the ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves , see dekker et al .",
    "2000 ) at the nasmyth focus of the eso 8.2 m kueyen telescope at paranal , chile , in october 1999 , and have been released for public use .",
    "details of observations and of data reduction are given in paper  i. we recall here that the resolving power is @xmath22/@xmath23 , which corresponds to a velocity resolution of @xmath24 6 km  s@xmath25 ( fwhm ) .",
    "singly ionized phosphorus , which is the dominant state in hi gas , has three strong uv lines with @xmath26  , 963.801  , and 1152.818  ( the corresponding @xmath27-values are equal to 0.3489 , 1.458 , and 0.2361 , according to morton 1991 ) . we have detected with confidence only the pii@xmath1  line which is shown in figure  1 together with the niii@xmath28  and feii@xmath29  lines .",
    "the pii@xmath30  is blended and the same occurs for pii@xmath31  as seen from the emmi spectrum of savaglio et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "neutral argon has two strong resonance lines in the ultraviolet region at @xmath32  and 1066.660  .",
    "their oscillator strengths are @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively from federman et al .",
    "the whole region of the qso  00002620 spectrum containing the two ari lines is shown in figure 2 to illustrate both the crowding of the ly@xmath2 forest and the few windows which were used for the continuum placing .",
    "the ar lines detected at @xmath3= 3.3901 are zoomed in figure  3 .",
    "the data used for ar result from the sum of only 2 spectra instead of the whole 3 since one of them turned out to be badly contaminated by a cosmic ray event .",
    "the s / n ratio for the ari @xmath0  line therefore is 40 . as can be seen from the figure , the ari@xmath0  line is relatively clean , but @xmath35   is partly blended with additional absorption .",
    "the ari line strengths are such that in the milky way they tend to be saturated even for tenuous lines of sight , but in our dla system saturation is not an issue because of the low metallicity @xmath36 ( paper  i ) .",
    "the measurements of metal absorption lines falling in the ly@xmath2 forest have to cope with the possible presence of hydrogen contamination and with a local continuum , drawn by using windows in the ly@xmath2 forest which could be located quite far from the feature under analysis .",
    "the pii@xmath37  line ( figure  1 ) shows a rather symmetric profile with its blue side reaching the continuum , while there could be a small contamination in the red wing .",
    "the ar line looks slightly more contaminated with absorption on both sides .",
    "the extra absorption around the ari line is a continuum - like absorption without signature of discrete features , which makes it hard to model with single hi clouds .",
    "our previous analysis of both metal and molecular hydrogen lines in this dla has shown that the line broadening in the @xmath3= 3.3901 system is mainly caused by macroscopic large - scale , rather than thermal , motions .",
    "all absorption lines from h@xmath4 to znii show symmetric profiles with the same doppler parameter of @xmath38 10 km  s@xmath25 within the uncertainty intervals ( papers i & ii ) .",
    "the measured broadening parameter , defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the one - dimensional gaussian velocity dispersion of ions along the line of sight , gives a turbulent velocity dispersion of about 7 km  s@xmath25 , a typical value for the milky way disk .",
    "we can therefore assume that the intrinsic profile of the ari@xmath0  and pii@xmath37  lines is the same for all neutral atoms and low ionized species from the hi region since they trace the same volume elements .    to calculate the confidence range for the doppler parameter we make use of all metal lines associated with the dla redwards the ly@xmath2 emission and minimize @xmath41 by varying all the other parameters .",
    "the calculated @xmath42 values as a function of @xmath43 with the @xmath44 and @xmath45 confidence levels are shown in figure  4 . at @xmath42",
    "= 1.148 the most likely value for @xmath43 is 10.00@xmath46 km s@xmath25 .",
    "the confidence ranges are computed following the procedure described in press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , here we fix the value of @xmath43 and minimize @xmath41 by varying all the other parameters .    the pii @xmath1  and ari @xmath0  lines are fitted with a theoretical one - component voigt profile to the observed intensities together with the full set of 6 metal lines , for 5 ionic species , which are located redwards the ly@xmath2 emission , namely the lines znii @xmath47  , crii @xmath48  , @xmath49  , feii @xmath50  , siii @xmath51  and niii @xmath52  , assuming that @xmath43 is the same for all lines and leaving all the elemental column densities as well as the local continuum @xmath53 around the pii@xmath1  and ari@xmath0  lines free to vary .",
    "we have therefore a total of 7 free parameters and 111 and 105 points for pii and ari , respectively , thus giving for the former @xmath54 degrees of freedom , and 98 for the latter .",
    "all the lines have been previously adjusted in wavelength by using the value of @xmath3= 3.390127 which corresponds to the redshift of the isolated niii@xmath55  absorption line ( paper  i ) .",
    "the calculated theoretical profiles were convolved with a gaussian instrumental profile with 6 km  s@xmath25width .",
    "the best fit for pii gives @xmath56 @xmath16 , @xmath43 = 9.96 km  s@xmath25 , and @xmath57 for a @xmath42 = 1.10 .",
    "the result is shown in figure  1 by the grey solid curve , whereas points with error bars give the normalized intensities , corresponding to a signal - to - noise ratio s / n @xmath58 per pixel .",
    "note that the intensities in the bottom panel of figure  1 are re - normalized in concordance with the local @xmath59 .",
    "the dotted curve shows the un - convolved theoretical pii profile in the range @xmath60 km  s@xmath25 .",
    "the column densities of zn , cr , si , ni and fe are consistent within 0.02 dex with those found in paper i. the errors in the pii column density are of 0.04 dex as can be deduced from figure  5 ( panel a ) , where the @xmath42 as a function of the @xmath13(pii ) column density is shown .",
    "the variations for @xmath59 , as well as @xmath43 as a function of @xmath13(pii ) are also shown in panels ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . the grey area in panel ( b )",
    "marks the range of possible continuum deviations which correspond to the @xmath44 confidence interval shown in panel ( a ) .",
    "the analysis of ar relies entirely on ari@xmath0  while ari@xmath35  of which only a portion is unblended , is checked for consistency with the line model but it is not used in the fit .",
    "the corresponding signal - to - noise ratio in this spectral region is approximately equal to 40 .",
    "figure  3 shows the best fit for the one - component profile ( grey continuous curve ) and the intrinsic un - convolved profile for only the ari@xmath0  line ( dotted curve ) .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the best fit obtained for the ari@xmath0  line provides a consistent fit of the red wing of the stronger ari@xmath35  line .",
    "note that a decrease of 0.1 dex in the ari column density is sufficient to destroy the perfect match present in the ari @xmath35  line . a @xmath42 = 1.138",
    "is found for @xmath61 @xmath16 , @xmath43 = 10.05 km  s@xmath25and @xmath62 .",
    "figure  6 shows the confidence levels for the ari column density , the variations for @xmath59 , and the doppler broadening .    to test the whole procedure we analyzed the feii@xmath29  line ,",
    "also shown in figure  1 .",
    "this is the only feii line in the ly@xmath2 forest which is not strongly blended .",
    "we then compared the results with those of the feii@xmath63  , which is placed redwards the qso ly@xmath2 emission in a clean spectral region and for which a reliable iron column density has already been derived in paper  i. for the feii@xmath29  line we used the empirical oscillator strength @xmath64 derived recently by howk et al .",
    "( 2000 ) by means of fuse observations .",
    "a @xmath42 = 1.0299 is found for @xmath65 @xmath16 , @xmath66 km  s@xmath25and @xmath67 . in this case",
    "we used only 6 metal lines from the red part of the quasar spectrum excluding feii@xmath63 from the @xmath41-minimization procedure .",
    "thus we had 6 free parameters \\{@xmath68 } , 93 data points , and @xmath69 degrees of freedom , and calculated @xmath42 as a finction of @xmath70 .",
    "the calculated confidence intervals are shown in figure  7 . the mean iron column density for feii@xmath29",
    " is 0.02 dex lower than that derived from feii@xmath63  in paper  i and is fully consistent within errors .",
    "this shows that we can indeed recover the ion column density accurately even though the line is falling in the lyman @xmath2 forest with random ly@xmath2 interlopers and uncertainties associated with the continuum drawing .",
    "the derived column densities and abundances for ar and p , together with those obtained for other species in previous studies , are reported in table  1 .",
    "the results presented above differ quite slightly from those obtained from a more commonly used analysis in which the continuum is kept fixed while both the broadening and the column density are left free to vary . in this approach",
    "we obtain for phosphorus @xmath13(pii ) @xmath71 @xmath16 and @xmath72 km  s@xmath25 , while for argon @xmath13(ari ) = @xmath73 @xmath16 and the @xmath74 km  s@xmath25 when the pii@xmath1  and ari@xmath0  lines were analized separately .",
    "the shift of the pii line is @xmath75 km  s@xmath25 , and that of the ari line center is negligible , namely @xmath76 km  s@xmath25 , which is less than one - half of the pixel width .",
    "the fact that both lines have the same centers and the same @xmath43-parameters which are very similar to those of metal lines observed in the low line density portion of the spectrum redwards the ly@xmath2 emission line , shows that the contamination of ari and pii lines observed in the ly@xmath2 forest is not significant in the @xmath3= 3.3901 system towards qso 00002620 .",
    "for both argon and phosphorus there are no determinations of the intrinsic abundances in either dwarf or giant stars because argon has optical transitions from very high excitation levels , and phosphorus shows too faint lines in stellar spectra .",
    "p was measured in chemically peculiar stars ( castelli et al . 1997 ) , halo horizontal - branch stars by bonifacio et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and sdb by ohl et al .",
    ". however , the elemental abundances in these stars are likely modified by atmospheric processes such as diffusion . a firm identification of the pv and piv has been made by junkkarinen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the bal qso pg 0946 + 301 and a remarkable overabundance of phosphorus with p / c @xmath77 60(p / c)@xmath78 was found .",
    "the lack of such important observational reference complicates the interpretation of the ar and p abundances in the dla systems .",
    "nevertheless , we may compare the measured [ ar / h ] and [ p / h ] ratios with theoretical predictions based on integrating massive star yields over an initial mass function given , for instance , by timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter tww ) . in this section",
    "we consider such issue and other physical properties of the @xmath3= 3.3901 system .",
    "argon is an extremely volatile element .",
    "it has been detected and studied in the galactic ism by means of copernicus , imaps and recently by fuse .",
    "the gas - phase ( ar / h ) ratio in the galactic interstellar medium is found to be below its solar value with reduction factors varying with the lines of sight .",
    "fitzpatrick ( 1996 ) argued that abundances of undepleted elements in the ism such as c , n , and o are below their solar values , but this can not explain the line of sight variations and the considerable amount of the observed ar deficiency , [ ar / h ] @xmath79 dex .",
    "since ar can be hardly depleted into dust grains , sofia & jenkins ( 1998 ) suggested that the apparent ar deficiency is caused by a partial ionization of ar by nearby uv stellar radiation .",
    "ari has an extraordinarily high photoionization cross section for photons with energy higher than the ip = 15.76 ev .",
    "its photoionization cross section is about ten times higher than that of hi over a broad range of energies .",
    "therefore , for a cloud that is not thick enough to shield its interior from outside sources of ionizing radiation , the uv photons may penetrate the cloud and partially ionize hydrogen , argon and other elements . in this case",
    "the fraction of ari can be lower than the corresponding fraction of hi since the absorption cross section of hydrogen diminishes @xmath80 for energies @xmath81  ev , an effect which may lead to an apparent deficiency of argon with respect to hydrogen if one assumes that both elements are mostly neutral .    reversing the argument presented by sofia & jenkins on the ari deficiency in the local interstellar medium ,",
    "the coincidence of the ar abundance with those of o , si and s ( see table  1 ) implies the absence of significant photoionizing flux from stars along the line of sight throughout the @xmath3= 3.3901 damped galaxy . otherwise , the presence of stellar photons with @xmath81  ev would decrease the ari abundance .",
    "the same effect is not observable in oi , although neutral oxygen also has a photoionization cross section larger than that of hi .",
    "oxygen ionization fractions are coupled with those of hydrogen via resonant charge exchange reactions .",
    "therefore , there is observational evidence that in this particular damped system the observed ionic species are from their dominant ionization stages in the hi gas and , hence , their abundances do not require ionization corrections which may be caused by a hard radiation field in a uniform and fluctuating gas density absorbing region , respectively ( viegas 1995 , levshakov et al .",
    "we would like to emphasize once more that our measurement of ari rules out the presence of active star formation regions and of significant partly ionized gas along the line of sight at @xmath3= 3.3901 .",
    "steidel & hamilton ( 1992 ) identified a galaxy at @xmath82 from the qso  00002620 sightline , which was supposed to be responsible for the @xmath3= 3.3901 damped system .",
    "giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found no ly@xmath2 flux in correspondence of this object by means of narrow - band imaging placing a 3@xmath83 upper limit of @xmath84 erg s@xmath25 @xmath16 .",
    "the object identified in steidel & hamilton ( 1992 ) is probably a high redshift galaxy at @xmath85 ( steidel 2000 ) , and therefore the galaxy at @xmath86 still remains undetected .",
    "however , the upper limit provided by giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in the ly@xmath2 emission refers to the sky area around the qso and remains valid regardless of the nature of the dla candidate .",
    "the general lack of ly@xmath2 emission from dlas has been commonly explained by the effect of dust and resonant scattering which can attenuate ly@xmath2 photons ( charlot & fall 1991 , 1993 ) .",
    "however , the extremely low dust content in our system with a dust - to - gas ratio of less than 10@xmath87 of the milky way value , coupled with no detectable effects on the ari abundance , suggests that most likely the dla in question is not a site of intense star formation",
    ".      observations of emission - lines in ionized hii regions of spiral and irregular galaxies provide abundances for o , s and ar among the others .",
    "none of these elements is expected to be heavily depleted into the solid phase as dust ( savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "it has already been pointed out that the abundance ratios [ s / o ] and [ ar / o ] appear to be universally constant and independent of metallicity over about 2 decades of oxygen abundances ( e.g. henry & worthey 1999 ) .",
    "since o production depends on the progenitor mass while ar and s do not , the implication of this constant ratio is that either the initial mass function is universally constant or that the observed elemental ratios are not sensitive to imf variations .",
    "sulfur and argon originate from explosive oxygen burning in type  ii supernova events through the chain @xmath88o + @xmath88o @xmath89 @xmath90si + @xmath91he , then @xmath90si + @xmath91he @xmath89 @xmath92s , and @xmath92s + @xmath91he @xmath89 @xmath93ar .",
    "however , substantial amounts of s and ar may be manufactured in type  ia supernova events ( nomoto et al . 1997 ) .",
    "considering the values of izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) for the extragalactic hii metal - poor regions , we have @xmath94 ( rms ) and @xmath95 ( rms ) .",
    "similar results , @xmath96 ( rms ) and @xmath97 ( rms ) , for the same class of objects have been recently obtained by kniazev et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "these observed ratios are comparable with the theoretical predictions of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) , nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and samland ( 1998 ) in which log(s / o ) is @xmath77 1.75 , 1.9 , 1.6 , and log(ar / o ) @xmath77 2.45 , 2.7 , and 2.4 , respectively .",
    "the theoretical predictions fall somewhat below the observed range , and either an overproduction of o in the models or a significant production of s and ar in type  ia supernovae are advocated .",
    "our results listed in table  1 show that the ar abundance follows closely the other @xmath2-chain element abundances in the @xmath3= 3.3901 system .",
    "the absolute oxygen abundance in this dla is @xmath98 , i.e. one order of magnitude below the value obtained in the most metal - poor galaxies where these elements were measured .",
    "the measured log(s / o ) and log(ar / o ) ratios are of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively , i.e. very close to the observed ratio in blue compact and spiral galaxies .",
    "this strongly favors the universality of ( s / o ) and ( ar / o ) ratios .",
    "the implication pointed out by henry & worthey ( 1999 ) that either the imf is universally constant or the stellar mass range which produces these elements is narrow enough to make the ratios insensitive to imf variations is reinforced and further extended to much more deficient material detected at @xmath3= 3.3901 .",
    "most of @xmath2 particle nuclei are synthesized primarily by type  ii supernovae during the early stages of the galaxy chemical evolution , while the fe - group elements are primarily produced by type  ia supernovae and build up over longer time scales . as a result , in the early phases of chemical enrichment",
    "the @xmath2-chain elements are expected to be relatively more abundant than the iron - peak elements .",
    "argon is a typical product of type  ii sne , and like zinc it is not depleted in the interstellar medium .",
    "this makes the [ ar / zn ] ratio a new and interesting dust - free diagnostic tool for verifying the presence of the @xmath2-chain element enhancement . by combining the present abundances with those previously determined ( see table  1 )",
    "we have disposal of a set of 4 indicators for the @xmath2-chain element abundances such as o , si , s , ar , and 4 indicators for the abundances of iron - peak elements such as cr , fe , ni , and zn . this is a rather unique circumstance among the dla systems studied so far .    the measured [ o , si , s , ar / cr , fe , ni , zn ] ratios reported in table  2 for quantitative comparison provide @xmath101-chain / iron - peak]@xmath102 dex ( the weighted mean and dispersion ) which becomes @xmath103 when the slightly deviating ni is not considered . in the case",
    "that ni resulted a better fe - peak indicator then fe , cr and zn , we would indeed find that [ o , si , s , ar / ni ] are + 0.41 , + 0.36 , + 0.29 and + 0.36 , respectively .",
    "however , prochaska & wolfe ( 1999 ) measured niii @xmath104  and found [ ni / h ] = @xmath105 , which becomes [ ni / h ] = @xmath106 when the @xmath107 values are taken from fedchak & lawler ( 1999 ) as we did for the niii @xmath52  ( paper i ) .",
    "the slightly different abundance obtained from the two niii lines prevents ni from being considered a safe proxy to the iron - peak abundances .",
    "an [ alpha / iron - peak ] ratio of @xmath77 0.1 is significantly lower than similar quantity in galactic stars with comparable metallicities , [ o , si , s / fe ]  @xmath108 dex ( mcwilliam 1997 , and references therein )",
    ". the difference would be even more striking if the high o values of [ o / fe ] = 0.7 found in halo stars at [ fe / h ] = 2 by israelian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) were confirmed .",
    "implications of low @xmath2-chain / iron - peak element ratios are discussed in paper  i , and the reader is referred to it for additional details . here",
    "we notice that the lack of significant [ ar / zn ] enhancement corroborates our previous results on this system as well as the assumption that , on the basis of their relative element abundances , at least some of the dla galaxies seem to undergo a chemical evolution which differs from that of the milky way ( centurin et al . 2000 ) .",
    "an analysis of the zinc abundances in the thick disk stars by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that zinc could be mildly overabundant with respect to iron with [ zn / fe ] = @xmath109 , a slight difference from the thin disk and halo behaviour found by sneden et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . however , in our dla [ zn / fe ] = @xmath110 and [ zn / cr ] = @xmath111 , which suggests that in the dlas zinc tracks fe and cr closely .",

    "the abundances of the refractory elements fe and cr are close to that of the non - refractory element zn , showing the absence of significant dust concentration along the line of sight ( paper  i ) .",
    "such a circumstance is extremely rare among dlas since even in the cases with low element depletion considered by pettini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , a difference between zn and fe , cr and ni has been always observed , with the exception of the damped system towards qso 0454 + 039 where [ zn / cr ] @xmath77 0 within the errors .",
    "moreover , the extremely low fraction of molecular hydrogen @xmath113 in our dla ( paper  ii ) rules out a significant depletion of p in a variety of molecular compounds . taking into account that the absorbing gas is mostly neutral ,",
    "as discussed above , we conclude that the observed gas - phase p abundance reflects the total amount of p.    the low abundance of p is close to those of other elements ( see table  1 ) and supports independently the early suggestion that the @xmath3= 3.3901 galaxy has indeed a low metallicity . in the context of the other published data this result suggests a possible mild decrease in the damped abundances at high redshift , which , however , is not evident when the column density - weighted mean is considered ( prochaska & wolfe 2000 ; vladilo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "theoretically the processes that produce the odd - z element phosphorus in late stages of stellar evolution are not identified clearly . as margaret burbidge ( 1999 ) pointed out the p synthesis was virtually ignored by burbidge et al .",
    "the only stable isotope is @xmath114p , which is strongly underproduced in the explosive o burning .",
    "p is likely produced in the carbon and neon shell burning by neutron capture similarly to the parent nuclei @xmath115si and @xmath116si .",
    "no significant p production is found during the explosion phases ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "phosphorus abundance , like that of the other odd - z elements na and al , should be proportional to @xmath117 , the total neutron excess in a given amount of matter , where @xmath118 represents the total number of neutrons per gram , both free and bound in nuclei , and @xmath119 the corresponding number for protons ( arnett 1971 ) . ] , which is @xmath120 , where @xmath121 denotes the fraction by mass of matter composed of nuclei with atomic number z  @xmath122 ( arnett 1971 , 1996 ) .",
    "as the metallicities decrease , the available nuclei which provide the neutron excess decrease too .",
    "however , in the primordial stellar yields arnett ( 1996 ) found that the odd - z nuclei are underabundant with reference to the even - z neighbours , but the effect is much smaller than that predicted by simple arguments of linear increase of neutron excess with metallicity .",
    "theoretical models by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) lead also to substantial p production with p yields showing a metallicity dependence which is more pronounced at very low metallicities .    in our dla",
    "the measured ratios [ p / si ] = @xmath8 and [ p / s ] = @xmath9 provide evidence for a mild odd - even effect , which , however , is less than what expected on the basis of the woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) and limongi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) yields .",
    "a similar value for [ p / s]=@xmath123 has been derived by outram et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in the dla at @xmath3=2.625 towards gb 1759 + 7539 , which with [ fe / h]=1.31 is however somewhat more metal rich than the dla studied here .    in stellar spectroscopy",
    "the element abundances are traditionally discussed as related to iron , [ x / fe ] , and as a function of the iron - to - hydrogen ratio , [ fe / h ] . following this way ,",
    "in figure  8 we compare our results with theoretical predictions since in our case there is no significant dust depletion in the @xmath3= 3.3901 absorber and , hence , [ fe / h ] can be used as a reference ratio .",
    "figure  8 shows the result of such comparison between the elements listed in table  1 ( dots with 3 @xmath83 error bars ) and the theoretical prediction ( shaded area ) .",
    "the width of the shaded area just above a marked element shows the uncertainty range ( @xmath124 dex ) for the relative abundance of this element [ x / fe ] at fixed metallicity [ fe / h ] =  2.0 .",
    "the uncertainty of theoretical predictions is caused by unknown model parameters as described in tww .",
    "the upper limit for the nitrogen - to - iron ratio is set by calculations which includseenhanced convection prescriptions , but the lower limit is not defined at low metallicities since the standard tww set of massive stars does not produce significant nitrogen yields .",
    "we see from figure  8 that there exists a general consistency between the observed [ x / fe ] ratios and the theoretical predictions .",
    "the p abundance is slightly suppressed whereas ar behaves like other @xmath2-chain elements .",
    "however , the same consistency is not found if compared with the halo stellar abundance pattern , where @xmath2-chain elements are much more enhanced .",
    "there are intrinsic uncertainties in the m  @xmath14 30 m@xmath78 extremely metal - poor massive - star models , which may be important here .",
    "tww suggest that their fe yields may be overestimated by a factor 2 , which , if applied in figure  8 , would shift all abundances by 0.3 dex along the ordinates .",
    "for instance in the samland ( 1998 ) analysis the @xmath2-chain elements are more enhanced in agreement with what is observed in the galactic halo stars .",
    "the p abundance found in our dla is slightly lower than fe and the other iron - peak elements showing that p was slightly undersolar at low metallicities .",
    "since p is produced almost entirely by massive stars to achieve the higher solar value , its production must increase with the metallicity of the gas also to compensate the contribution to iron made by type i snae . in other words",
    "the p yields have to be necessarily metallicity dependent .",
    "this illustrates well how direct p observations in metal - poor environments can be used to constrain the parameter values in the stellar nucleosynthesis theory .",
    "the obtained results on p and fe abundances do not seem to agree with the dust formation processes in the galaxy where iron depletion in the diffuse interstellar clouds has been well studied . in section 1 ,",
    "two possible mechanisms of the dust formation processes were outlined , and it was noted that p and fe abundances may be used for choosing one of them .",
    "for instance , if the dust grains grow in the interstellar medium we could detect a disparity in p and fe gas - phase abundances as seen in the galactic diffuse clouds .",
    "obviously this is not the case for the @xmath3= 3.3901 system .",
    "if , however , the dust grains are formed in hot shells of supernova remnants  an example of this process has recently been presented by arendt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who revealed fe protosilicate in the cas  a ejecta  then we should observe a gas - phase depletion for both p and fe , since they have the same condensation temperature .",
    "this has not been found in our dla either .",
    "therefore , neither of the two possible mechanisms of dust formation seem to work in the @xmath3= 3.3901 damped ly-@xmath2 cloud .",
    "taking into account that both volatile and non - volatile elements do not show significant differences in their abundances from the expected quantities , we may conclude that in this dla possible destructive processes are also insufficient to cause some evaporation of the volatile substances .",
    "the number density of neutral hydrogen , @xmath125 , in the @xmath3= 3.3901 system can be estimated by using the relative population ratio of the first excited state oi@xmath126 ( @xmath10p@xmath11 ) to the ground state oi ( @xmath10p@xmath4 ) .    in hi regions with temperatures ranging from 100  k to 1000  k ,",
    "the rate coefficients for collisions with hydrogen atoms are larger than those for electron collisions when the electron density , @xmath127 , is small , i.e. @xmath128 ( bahcall & wolf 1968 ) .",
    "if we also neglect the contributions of proton and molecular hydrogen collisions , the equilibrium equation for the three - level system ( @xmath10p@xmath4 , @xmath10p@xmath11 , and @xmath10p@xmath129 states of oi ) can be written as @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the rate coefficients of the o ",

    "h collisions in the temperature range from 50  k to 1000  k , are given by launay & roueff ( 1977 ) .",
    "the corresponding excitation rates for upward transitions can be calculated from the principle of detailed balance which implies @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the degeneracies of states @xmath10p@xmath129 , @xmath10p@xmath11 and @xmath10p@xmath4 , respectively .",

    ", we estimate @xmath143 @xmath16 , at 1 @xmath83 confidence level .",
