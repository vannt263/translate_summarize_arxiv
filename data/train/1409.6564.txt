    "all basis states are degenerate , we set their energy to 0 . in absence of external magnetic field , within each pillar linearly polarised states are uncoupled , therefore we find that 2x2 diagonal blocks of the hamiltonian consist of zeros .",

    "their nondiagonal terms are zero due to the fact that linearly polarised eigenstates of lt effective field are not rotated during propagation .",
    "a transfer to the basis of circularly polarised states gives @xmath78 matrix elements at diagonals and introduces off - diagonal terms @xmath79 .",
    "starting from this hamiltonian we construct the polaritonic graphene effective hamiltonian on the basis of bloch wavefunctions @xmath80 in closest neighbour hopping approximation .",
    "we account for magnetic field via zeeman splitting @xmath10 of states , localised at a pillar , and finally arrive to hamiltonian ( [ ham_h ] ) .",
    "to demonstrate one - way edge states in tight - binding approach , we derive a @xmath81x@xmath81 hamiltonian for a polariton graphene tape , consisting of @xmath82 infinite zig - zag stripes . for this we set a basis of bloch waves @xmath83 , where @xmath84 index numerates stripes , and @xmath85 is the quasi - wavevector in the infinite zig - zag direction . 4x4",

    "similar to the tight binding model , the numerical analysis starts from the calculation of the dispersion .",
    "for this , a single excitation spot of a small size @xmath87 m is used , combined with a short pulse duration of @xmath88 ps , in order to excite a large part of the dispersion .",
    "then , the schrodinger equation ( 5 ) is integrated for 200 ps , and the resulting wavefunction @xmath89 is fourier - transformed over time and spatial coordinates to give @xmath90 , which is the dispersion .",
    "such calculation was carried out with the excitation taking place in the `` volume '' of the polariton graphene structure and on its surface .",

    "we have also analyzed the transverse profile of the surface states appearing under the effect of the magnetic field in the numerical simulations , as shown in figure 3b of the main text .",
    "this profile is plotted in figure s2 with a solid line , while the dashed line is the exponential decay fit with a characteristic density decay length of 3.1 @xmath52 m .",
    "this value corresponds very well to the one expected from the analytical estimate based on the particle effective mass and the width of the gap .        in this section ,",

    "the lower state is b+ and the upper state is a- , while in the k point the lower state is a+ and the upper is b- .",
    "this difference can be evidenced experimentally thanks to the possibility of direct optical measurements of the quantum states and also the controllable direct quasi - resonant excitation of the states of interest . for this , we have excited the system with a large pumping spot @xmath91 m , centering the pump first at the k point , and then at the k point ( @xmath92 m ) , keeping its energy @xmath93 mev within the gap .",
