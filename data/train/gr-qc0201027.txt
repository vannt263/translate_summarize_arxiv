    "the study of lorentzian wormholes @xcite in general relativity has suffered from the absence of conventional microscopic descriptions of the matter that holds open the throat of the wormhole .",
    "indeed , it is known on one hand that such matter has to violate the null energy condition , while on the other hand , most known matter forms do not @xcite .",
    "thus , many wormholes have been investigated in alternative theories of gravity , such as brans - dicke theory , or quantum effects have been invoked . however , in principle , classical general relativity admits stable wormhole solutions supported by simple matter forms . in this paper",
    "we introduce a general class of matter lagrangians and study the properties they have to satisfy in order to allow the existence of wormholes .",
    "these matter forms necessarily violate some of the standard energy conditions , and hence , their study also offers the possibility to address the physical nature of these conditions and their relation to issues , such as the stability of vacuum .",
    "a phenomenological way of microscopically characterizing an unknown form of matter is to describe it by a scalar field .",
    "whereas an ordinary scalar field always satisfies the null energy condition , a scalar field with non - standard kinetic terms ( different from the conventional squared gradient ) can violate any desired energy condition @xcite .",
    "in this paper we assume that the matter that threads a wormhole consists of a scalar field @xmath0 whose lagrangian @xmath1 is an a - priori undetermined function of the squared gradient @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that the existence of wormhole solutions in general relativity essentially determines the form of this lagrangian .",
    "it has to describe a massless scalar field whose kinetic term has the opposite sign as conventionally assumed ( @xmath3 instead of @xmath4 ) . although we must agree that the issue is yet unsettled , we have not discovered any inconsistency in this choice and we are not aware of any physical principle that forbids such a field . in particular , we have analysed in appendix [ sec : appendix ] the stability of minkowski vacuum against second order perturbations in such a theory , and our analysis has not shown any substantial difference to the minkowski vacuum in the presence of a conventional massless scalar field . in a certain sense , the opposite sign is preferable to the conventional one .",
    "it is known that all spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s field equations coupled to a massless scalar field @xcite have naked singularities ( admittedly , these solutions are unstable @xcite ) .",
    "however , if the massless scalar field is coupled to gravity with the opposite sign , most of the solutions are regular everywhere , and describe in fact wormholes @xcite .",
    "even cosmological solutions are better - behaved . instead of running or originating at a big - bang singularity",
    ", the universe bounces at a finite value of the scalar factor in a transition form contraction to expansion .",
    "obviously , the non - singular behavior of these solutions is linked to the violation of the standard energy conditions by such a field .",
    "ironically , in their quest of non - singular particle - like solutions in general relativity , einstein and rosen @xcite already pointed out in 1935 that by reversing the sign of the free maxwell lagrangian , one can obtain solutions free from singularities , which may be in fact interpreted as charged particles .",
    "scalar fields with the opposite sign of their kinetic terms have been also previously considered in the literature .",
    "as mentioned , they have been already shown to allow wormhole solutions @xcite , they appear in certain models of inflation @xcite , they have been proposed as dark energy candidates @xcite , and they also appear in certain unconventional supergravity theories which admit de sitter solutions @xcite . in this work",
    "we conclude on one hand that the existence of wormhole solutions forces such a negative kinetic term , but on the other hand , we argue that although the physical significance and relevance of such a field is unclear , these wormhole solutions are perfectly sensible .",
    "for instance , one may suspect that due to the unconventional form of the scalar field lagrangian , those wormhole solutions are unstable .",
    "we have analysed the stability of a particular class of solutions , those of zero mass , against arbitrary linear perturbations of the metric and the scalar field .",
    "these perturbations can be decomposed into spherical harmonics of definite `` angular momentum '' @xmath5 , and the stability of each mode @xmath5 can be studied separately .",
    "we find that all modes are stable , proving this way that the zero mass solutions are stable against arbitrary linear perturbations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : geometries ] we review the basic properties of wormholes and discuss how their existence constrains the forms of matter that may support them . in section [ sec : k - field ] this matter is characterized by an a - priori undetermined scalar field lagrangian .",
    "the requirements of asymptotic flatness and existence of a wormhole throat essentially fix the previously undetermined lagrangian . as mentioned , it has to describe a minimally coupled scalar field with a sign reversed kinetic term .",
    "section [ sec : solutions ] discusses static , spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s field equations sourced by an ordinary massless scalar field .",
    "all of them contain naked singularities at the origin . by assuming the field to be purely imaginary , which is equivalent to assume that the kinetic term of the scalar field has the opposite sign",
    ", we rediscover the regular wormhole solutions of @xcite .",
    "they are parametrized by a mass and a charge , and section [ sec : stability ] addresses the stability of a subset of these wormholes , namely , those of zero mass .",
    "it is found that all solutions in this subset are stable , and that this stability can be also extended to sufficiently small values of the mass .",
    "finally , appendix [ sec : appendix ] illustrates the extent an unconventional sign in the massless scalar field lagrangian affects the stability of minkowski space , and concludes that in any case even the minkowski vacuum in the presence of a conventional scalar field is in a certain sense gravitationally unstable .",
    "roughly speaking , a ( lorentzian ) wormhole is a spacetime whose spatial sections contain two asymptotically flat regions joined by a `` throat '' ( see figure [ fig : wormhole ] ) .",
    "the first recognized example of a wormhole , the einstein - rosen bridge @xcite , is part of the maximally extended schwarzschild solution of einstein s vacuum field equations .",
    "in the former , the presence of an event horizon prevents observers from traveling between the two asymptotically flat regions . by definition ,",
    "traversable wormholes are wormhole geometries that do not contain horizons , in such a way that an observer may travel in both ways through the throat of the wormhole . for simplicity",
    ", we shall consider only spherically symmetric , static wormholes in this paper .",
    "any static , spherically symmetric metric can be cast in the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the line element on a unit 2-sphere .",
    "the function @xmath8 determines the frequency of freely propagating photons as measured by static observers , and it is hence called the redshift function . the variable @xmath9 is a proper distance coordinate and surfaces of constant @xmath9 have areas equal to @xmath10 . in order to describe a traversable wormhole ,",
    "the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) has to satisfy the following conditions :    * existence of two asymptotically flat regions + the spatial sections of ( [ eq : metric ] ) contain two different asymptotically flat infinities , if as @xmath11 , the function @xmath12 approaches @xmath13 .",
    "these two different regions of space , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are connected by a `` throat '' if the function @xmath16 is regular everywhere . without loss of generality",
    ", we can choose the wormhole throat , the @xmath17 surface of minimal area , to be at @xmath18 .",
    "then , at the throat , @xmath19 where a prime ( @xmath20 ) means a derivative with respect to @xmath9",
    ". a spatial geometry that satisfies these conditions is shown in figure [ fig : wormhole ] . *",
    "absence of horizons + so that no horizons prevent the passage between the two asymptotically flat regions , the function @xmath21 should be non - zero . at the same time",
    ", observers should be able to travel between two arbitrary points in space in a finite time , implying that @xmath8 should be finite everywhere .",
    "it turns out , that the mere existence of a wormhole throat severely constrains the properties of the matter that threads it .",
    "let @xmath22 be the stress - energy tensor of the matter that supports the wormhole and lets denote its different components by @xmath23 hence , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath1 are the energy density , the radial tension and the `` angular '' pressure measured by a static observer .",
    "we work in units where @xmath26 and our metric signature is @xmath27 .",
    "the only non - trivial einstein equations for the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) are then    [ eq : einstein ] @xmath28    which in turn automatically imply what can be considered as the equation of motion of matter @xmath29 if one subtracts equation ( [ eq : tau - field ] ) from ( [ eq : rho - field ] ) and evaluates the result at the throat ( @xmath18 ) , one gets using the finiteness of @xmath30 and ( [ eq : flaring - r ] ) @xmath31 recall that @xmath25 is a tension , i.e. a negative pressure . hence , as it is well - known @xcite , the matter that threads the throat of the wormhole violates the null and @xmath32 , the weak , @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the strong , @xmath35 and @xmath36 energy conditions @xcite .",
    "we call such matter `` exotic '' .     of the wormhole ( [ eq : metric ] ) ( one dimension suppressed ) .",
    "the coordinate @xmath9 labels the proper distance to the throat along `` radial '' directions .",
    "surfaces of constant @xmath9 have area @xmath37 ( shown here as circles of circumference @xmath38 ) .",
    "as one approaches @xmath39 , the location of the two distinct asymptotic infinities , the circumference of the circles approaches @xmath40 , the geometry becomes flat.[fig : wormhole ] ]",
    "one can draw two different conclusions from the fact that only exotic matter may be able to support a wormhole .",
    "if one assumes that all matter forms satisfy the above mentioned energy conditions , then our previous result excludes wormholes from general relativity . on the other hand ,",
    "if one insists upon the existence of wormholes , it follows that the matter that threads them has to be `` exotic '' .",
    "let us point out that , to our knowledge , there is no reason why all matter forms should satisfy the null , weak and strong energy conditions .",
    "in fact , recent indications that the universe is currently accelerating @xcite directly imply that the strong energy condition is violated in nature , by what seems to be acting as a non - vanishing positive cosmological constant .",
    "the weak energy condition is violated by a negative cosmological constant , and the study of spaces with such a negative cosmological constant has recently attracted significant attention ( see references to @xcite ) .",
    "finally a scalar field with non - linear kinetic terms , a k - field , can basically violate any desired energy condition @xcite .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to show that , at least in principle , a simple k - field may indeed support wormholes in general relativity .",
    "it turns out , that the lagrangian we are going to consider respects the arguably only physically motivated energy condition , the requirement that the energy - momentum current @xmath41 measured by an observer with arbitrary four velocity @xmath42 be non - spacelike and @xmath43 . ] .",
    "a k - field is a scalar field @xmath0 minimally coupled to einstein gravity . by definition ,",
    "its action is given by @xmath44 = \\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g } \\left[-\\frac{r}{4}+p(x)\\right]+ s_m[g_{\\alpha\\beta},\\psi_m].\\ ] ] here , the k - field lagrangian @xmath45 is an arbitrary function of the squared scalar field gradient , @xmath46 which for a static , spherically symmetric configuration is negative , @xmath47 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the k - field lagrangian @xmath1 only depends on the squared gradient @xmath48 and not on the k - field @xmath0 itself .",
    "therefore , the theory is symmetric under constant shifts of the field @xmath49 and the corresponding current conservation yields the equation of motion of the k - field , @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "the action ( [ eq : action ] ) can be regarded as the simplest generic phenomenological way of providing a microscopic description of the unknown matter that supports a wormhole .",
    "we assume that the field only couples to einstein gravity , and not to additional matter fields @xmath52 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the k - field is given by functional differentiation of the k - field action @xmath53 if the scalar field gradient is space - like ( as is the case in a static field configuration ) it can be cast in the form @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a space - like unit vector pointing in the direction of the field gradient , @xmath56 is the radial tension , @xmath57 is the energy density and @xmath1 is the pressure as defined in ( [ eq : components ] ) . notice that , unlike in a situation where the field gradient is time - like @xcite , the energy - momentum tensor does _ not _ have perfect fluid form .",
    "the k - field equation of motion ( [ eq : k - field - motion ] ) can be derived both by functional differentiation of the k - field action or by requiring the energy momentum tensor to be covariantly conserved . for a static , spherically symmetric field configuration ,",
    "the field equation is given by the `` energy conservation '' law ( [ eq : matter ] ) .",
    "the different properties of a wormhole severely restrict the possible lagrangians @xmath45 which may support it . according to ( [ eq : null ] )",
    ", the null energy condition has to be violated at the throat of the wormhole . using the properties of the k - field energy momentum tensor",
    ", one finds that @xmath58 should be positive at @xmath18 and hence there should exist an @xmath59 , the value of @xmath48 at the throat , such that @xmath60    on the other hand , the requirement of asymptotic flatness also yields important information about the form of the pressure @xmath1 at infinity . the gravitational field of any isolated source in asymptotically flat spacetime can be expanded in multipole moments .",
    "if the source is static and spherically symmetric only monopole moments contribute to the gravitational field , and there exists then a coordinate system where the metric admits an asymptotic expansion of the form @xcite @xmath61.\\ ] ] of course , the k - field can not be considered as a localized ( finite - size ) source .",
    "we assume that the k - field decays sufficiently fast at infinity , in such a way that the expansion ( [ eq : multipoles ] ) still applies .",
    "plugging the above metric expansion coefficients into einstein s field equations ( we shall not write them down here ) , one can derive analogous expansions for @xmath1 and @xmath25 , @xmath62 substituting these expansions into the field equation of motion in these coordinates , one finds @xmath63 ( as appropriate for a mass term ) and @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , @xmath65 at infinity both pressure and radial tension vanish and in the asymptotic limit @xmath66 the ratio of the pressure to the radial tensor tends to 1 .",
    "we conclude that there should exist an @xmath67 , the asymptotic value of @xmath48 as @xmath14 , where @xmath68 and such that , around @xmath67 , @xmath69 we will argue below that @xmath70 should be non - zero between @xmath67 and @xmath59 .",
    "then , in order for ( [ eq : ultrahard ] ) to be satisfied , @xmath71 should be also different from zero .",
    "therefore , it follows from ( [ eq : vanishing - pressures ] ) that @xmath72 , and thus , around the origin @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an arbitrary non - zero coefficient which can be chosen to be @xmath75 by a field redefinition .",
    "hence , up to a sign , the k - field behaves at infinity as a massless scalar field .",
    "this is consistent with the pressure decaying as @xmath76 in the limit @xmath66 , which corresponds to a @xmath77 decay of the field @xmath0 at infinity .",
    "finally , as pointed out above , a well defined field equation of motion requires @xmath78 the reason is that the points where @xmath79 are barriers over which the field equation of motion ( [ eq : matter ] ) can not be integrated , so that a continuous field configuration interpolating between @xmath59 and @xmath67 requires @xmath70 to be non - zero within that interval .",
    "conditions ( [ eq : flaring ] ) , ( [ eq : linear ] ) and ( [ eq : regular ] ) essentially determine the form of the lagrangian @xmath1 ( as illustrated in figure [ fig : p - of - x ] ) . around the origin",
    "@xmath1 must be linear and , in addition , there must exist a point @xmath59 where the slope of @xmath1 is negative .",
    "suppose that @xmath80 around the origin . then there must exist a local minimum of @xmath81 between @xmath59 and @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "at the minimum @xmath84 is negative , whereas at the origin @xmath85 is positive . by continuity",
    "there is a point @xmath86 where @xmath70 is zero , violating condition ( [ eq : regular ] ) .",
    "we are forced to choose @xmath87 around @xmath72 .",
    "an analogous argument implies that the function @xmath1 can not have a local maximum , so we conclude that @xmath45 should be a monotonically decreasing function which is linear at the origin . the simplest function which satisfies this criterion is @xmath88 .    .",
    "it must have a negative slope at @xmath59 , it must be linear around the origin but because of ( [ eq : regular ] ) , it can not have local maxima or minima .",
    "thus , @xmath1 has to be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath48 with a negative slope at the origin.[fig : p - of - x ] ]",
    "our previous analysis has determined that @xmath88 is the simplest lagrangian which may allow a wormhole solution . from now on ,",
    "we shall concentrate on this form of the lagrangian .",
    "notice that for a conventional massless scalar field @xmath89 .",
    "hence , the field we are considering is a massless field with a reversed sign kinetic term .",
    "as long as the effect of the field on gravity can be ignored , the overall sign of the matter lagrangian is a matter of convention . in particular , in any given gravitational background the equation of motion of such a field is the same as the one of a conventional massless scalar , @xmath90 .",
    "it is the way the field couples to gravity that determines the sign of the lagrangian . if the scalar field couples only to gravity , this sign can be chosen at will , as long as this does not yield any inconsistency .",
    "static , spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s equations minimally coupled to a _ conventional _",
    "massless scalar field have been repeatedly discovered in the literature @xcite . particularly useful for our purposes",
    "are the solutions as presented by wyman ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is defined by the form of the scalar field solution @xmath94 these solutions are characterized by two integration constants , a mass @xmath95 and a `` charge '' @xmath93 .",
    "because the scalar field solution ( [ eq : field ] ) is proportional to @xmath93 and the energy - momentum tensor ( [ eq : emt ] ) is quadratic in @xmath0 , a real @xmath93 describes a conventionally coupled scalar field , while a purely imaginary @xmath93 is equivalent to considering a field with a negative kinetic term . for an ordinary coupling ( @xmath96 )",
    "the above solutions describe a spacetime with a naked singularity at @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , after a coordinate transformation , ( [ eq : wyman ] ) can be cast in the form @xmath98 where one sees that the would - be schwarzschild horizon has shrunk to a point at @xmath99 .",
    "if the charge vanishes , @xmath100 , equation ( [ eq : lacamera ] ) obviously reduces to the schwarzschild metric .",
    "if @xmath92 itself is negative , the metric ( [ eq : lacamera ] ) is not well defined . of course",
    ", @xmath101 can be negative only if @xmath93 is purely imaginary ( we assume the mass @xmath95 to be real . ) this is physically equivalent to a real scalar field whose kinetic term has the opposite sign , which is precisely the coupling we are interested in . in what follows",
    ", we assume that both @xmath101 and @xmath102 are negative . by a change of radial coordinates , the metric ( [ eq : wyman ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath103,\\ ] ] where the old coordinate @xmath104 is implicitly expressed in terms of the new coordinate @xmath105 by the relation @xmath106 and the explicit functional dependence @xmath107 is determined by the requirements of continuity and differentiability .",
    "the metric ( [ eq : wormhole - set ] ) was first discovered in a different coordinate system in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and classical scattering in such a geometry has been studied in @xcite .",
    "although we shall not cast ( [ eq : wormhole - set ] ) in proper distance coordinates , it is quite clear that it describes a traversable wormhole . due to the presence of the @xmath108 term ,",
    "the coordinate @xmath105 may take values in the range @xmath109 .",
    "the form of @xmath110 as a function of @xmath105 is shown in figure [ fig : r - of - r ] .",
    "the function @xmath111 is finite everywhere and in particular , the metric ( [ eq : wormhole - set ] ) does not contain any horizon . in the limit @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and in the limit @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "hence , the spatial sections of ( [ eq : wormhole - set ] ) contain two asymptotically flat regions and the masses of the wormhole as observed in those regions are @xmath95 and @xmath116 respectively . notice that the two masses have opposite sign",
    "in addition , because the redshift function is not symmetric under reflections @xmath117 , clocks tick at different rates in both asymptotic regions and a photon emitted at @xmath118 will appear to be blue shifted at @xmath119 .",
    "the @xmath105 dependence of the scalar field also has the form of figure [ fig : r - of - r ] .",
    "the scalar field solutions is proportional to @xmath93 and that is the reason why it can be interpreted as a scalar charge ( this identification will be made more precise below . )     as a function of the coordinate @xmath105 .",

    "the most general metric perturbation for @xmath163 ( spherically symmetric ) has fewer free functions than for @xmath177 .",

    "therefore , @xmath166 magnetic modes are also stable .    up to now",
    ", our discussion has focused on the stability of the zero mass solutions . because of that , we have only considered time dependent perturbations , i.e on non - zero values of @xmath145 .",
    "if one studies time - independent @xmath163 perturbations , one has to recover non - zero mass solutions ( [ eq : wormhole - set ] ) for sufficiently small values of @xmath95 as time - independent perturbations of the zero - mass solutions . due to linearity",
    ", the time - dependent perturbations around these non - zero mass solutions satisfy , of course , the same perturbation equations ( [ eq : electric - linearized ] ) and ( [ eq : magnetic - linearized ] ) .",
    "since these equations do not have any spatially well - behaved growing solution , we conclude that at least for sufficiently small values of @xmath95 the solutions ( [ eq : wormhole - set ] ) are also stable .",
    "this completes our wormhole stability analysis .    up to some extent ,",
    "the stability of the wormhole solutions we have considered was to be expected in the light of the results of @xcite . in that work",
    ", it is shown that the speed of propagation of linear perturbations in a cosmological background , @xmath187 , is given by @xmath188 if the squared speed of happened to be negative , one would anticipate instabilities of the wormhole associated with the exponential growth of short - wavelength modes . because @xmath189 in our model , there is no reason to expect those instabilities .",
    "however , this argument only addresses the issue partially , since static , spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s equations coupled to a _ canonical _ field ( @xmath190 ) _ are _ unstable @xcite .",
    "( in the latter case the instability appears in the @xmath163 mode . )",
    "non - canonical scalar field lagrangians allow the existence of wormhole solutions in general relativity .",
    "the conditions of asymptotic flatness and the existence of a wormhole throat essentially force the non - canonical scalar field to be a massless scalar field with a reversed sign lagrangian .",
    "zero mass wormhole solutions to einstein s equations coupled to such a field turn out to be extremely simple and are useful as toy models to explore different aspects of wormhole physics . as a particular application , it is possible to show their stability against linear perturbations analytically .",
    "the issue about the physical viability of such a scalar field is yet unsettled , although at the level of our investigation we have not discovered any internal inconsistency .",
    "rather , it turns out that because such a field violates some of the standard energy conditions , cosmological and spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s field equations are singularity - free .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank sean carroll s group , stefan hollands , david kutasov and robert wald for constructive criticism and discussions on the subject , and jennifer chen for improving the original manuscript .",
    "the author has also benefitted from many useful conversations over the time with slava mukhanov .",
    "some of the calculations in this paper have been performed with the grtensorii package for mathematica .",
    "this work has been supported by the u.s .",
    "doe grant de - fg02 - 90er40560 .",
    "i would like to thank also g. clement and k. bronnikov for kindly bringing to my attention references @xcite after a first submission of the preprint .",
    "our work has mainly focused on a massless scalar field described by a lagrangian @xmath1 whose sign has been reversed . in other words , we have considered a lagrangian @xmath191 where @xmath192 is @xmath193 instead of @xmath194 .",
    "one of the main objections against such an assumption is that for such a scalar field , minkowski space should be unstable .",
    "indeed , on general grounds one expects small scalar field fluctuations to radiate positive energy in form of gravitational waves , making the negative energy density of the initial field fluctuations even more negative and leading to a complete instability of the vacuum .",
    "let us verify whether one observes this kind of behavior in perturbation theory .",
    "in order to establish the difference with respect to an ordinary scalar field , we will keep @xmath192 as a free parameter . consider perturbations of minkowski space to second order , @xmath195 where the notation should be obvious , and consider equally second order perturbations of of a constant massless scalar field , @xmath196 where @xmath197 . to first order in perturbation theory , the einstein and klein - gordon equations are @xmath198 upon gauge fixing , the first of the equations describes gravitational waves propagating in minkowski spacetime , while the second one describes scalar field waves propagating in the same background .",
    "notice that these equations are the same regardless of @xmath192 in ( [ eq : twosigns ] ) . at this level ,",
    "both signs are equally valid .",
    "consider then the second order einstein equations , @xmath199 the sign of the first term on the right hand is determined by the conventional / unconventional coupling of the massless scalar field to gravity and the second term on the right hand side contains all terms of the einstein tensor quadratic in the first order perturbations @xmath200 .",
    "thus , the right hand side of the above equation describes how the first order scalar field and gravitational waves respectively back - react on the background geometry . whereas the gravitational wave back - reaction is the same for both signs of the scalar field coupling , the scalar field wave back - reaction on the metric does depend to this order on the sign of the energy momentum tensor , as expected .",
    "the klein - gordon equation to second order @xmath201 describes how first order scalar and gravitational waves generate second order field perturbations . for given perturbations ,",
    "it is the same for both signs of the scalar field coupling .",
    "suppose that we solve equation ( [ eq : backreaction ] ) in a given background of first order scalar waves ( assume for the sake of the argument that there are no gravitational waves . )",
    "the solution is given by the convolution of the ( known ) source terms in the right hand side with the appropriate retarded green s function .",
    "in particular , the solutions for both values of @xmath192 differ only by a sign .",
    "if the solution is well behaved for @xmath202 , it is also well behaved for @xmath203 .",
    "thus , at second order there is not yet any evidence that @xmath204 is preferable to @xmath203 .",
    "it seems that if we want to single out @xmath202 as the preferred choice of the scalar field coupling , we have to go to higher orders .    due to the structure of the perturbation equations , even if we proceeded to higher orders it would be difficult to discover why @xmath204 is essentially different from @xmath203 ( as in the `` analogous '' system of two coupled scalar fields , one with a conventional , the other with an unconventional kinetic term . ) at this point let us try a non - perturbative analysis and point out that even the conventional coupling @xmath202 leads to instabilities .",
    "consider for that purpose an homogeneous spatially flat universe filled by a canonical scalar field , @xmath205.\\ ] ] it is known that the solution of einstein s and klein - gordon equations in such a spacetime is given by @xmath206 this solution has two branches , related to each other by time reversal . for positive times , the universe starts expanding at the big bang singularity at @xmath207 and approaches minkowski space at @xmath208 ( the hubble parameter @xmath209 approaches zero ) .",
    "for negative times the universe starts from minkowski space at @xmath210 and contracts into a `` pre - big bang '' singularity at @xmath211 .",
    "this latter branch implies that a canonical massless scalar field in minkowski space is `` unstable '' upon contraction . as a matter of fact ,",
    "this instability is one of the ideas behind the pre - big bang scenario and reflects nothing else other than the gravitational instability upon collapse of the scalar and gravitational waves around minkowski spacetime @xcite we have previously encountered .",
    "notice that an analogous argument applies for @xmath88 , though there is a crucial difference too . in the latter case ,",
    "the scalar field has a negative energy density , and the spatial sections of the universe have to be negatively curved .",
    "expanding solutions hence asymptotically approach the `` milne universe '' , which is just a portion of minkowski space . on the other hand contracting solutions ( the time reversed expanding solutions )",
    "originate from minkowski space and instead of running into a singularity , bounce at a finite value of @xmath212 and expand again into minkowski spacetime ( this is possible because our field violates the null energy condition @xcite ) .          c. armendariz - picon , t. damour and v. mukhanov , _ k - inflation _",
