    "understanding turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) in a fluid heated from below [ @xcite ] is one of the challenging and largely unsolved problems in nonlinear physics .",
    "an important aspect is the global heat transport that is usually expressed in terms of the nusselt number @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the heat - current density , @xmath25 the sample height , @xmath26 the applied temperature difference , and @xmath27 the thermal conductivity of the fluid in the absence of convection .",
    "a central prediction of various theoretical models [ @xcite ] is a relationship between @xmath0 , the rayleigh number @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the isobaric thermal expension coefficient , @xmath30 the thermal diffusivity , @xmath31 the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath32 the acceleration of gravity ) , and the prandtl number @xmath33 .",
    "a model developed recently by @xcite , based on the decomposition of the kinetic and the thermal dissipation into boundary - layer and bulk contributions , provided an excellent fit to experimental data of @xcite and @xcite for a cylindrical cell of aspect ratio @xmath34 ( @xmath3 is the sample diameter ) when it was properly adapted [ @xcite , gl ] to the relatively small reynolds numbers of the measurements .",
    "however , the data were used to determine five adjustable parameters of the model .",
    "thus more stringent tests using measurements for the same @xmath15 but over wider ranges of @xmath1 and @xmath35 are desirable .",
    "a great success of the model was the excellent agreement with recent results by @xcite for much larger prandtl numbers than those of @xcite , at rayleigh numbers near @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "here we present new measurements in a cell of diameter @xmath11 cm for @xmath38 that , for @xmath39 , extend to @xmath40 .",
    "we also report results for @xmath11 cm and @xmath41 and 0.667 , as well as for @xmath5 cm and @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath42 it is expected that the large - scale flow ( lsf ) in the cell [ @xcite ] consists of a single convection roll [ @xcite ] . for @xmath43 , on the other hand , @xcite suggest that the system contains two or more rolls placed vertically one above the other .",
    "how this impacts the heat transport was one of the interesting questions to be addressed .",
    "our results suggest that even the cell with @xmath10 still contained only one roll because the data for @xmath0 fall on a smooth line drawn through those for the larger @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath44 results fall about 2.5% below all the other data , suggesting a more complicated , perhaps two - roll , structure for the lsf .",
    "most of our measurements were made at a mean temperature of 40@xmath45c , where @xmath46 .",
    "however , for @xmath47 we also made measurements at mean temperatures of 50 and 30@xmath45c , corresponding to @xmath48 and 5.42 respectively .",
    "we found a very gentle decrease of @xmath0 with increasing @xmath35 , approximately in proportion to @xmath49 .",
    "one of the experimental problems in the measurement of @xmath50 is that the side wall often carries a significant part of the heat current .",
    "corrections for this effect are not easily made , because of the thermal contact between the wall and the fluid that yields a two - dimensional temperature field in the wall , and because of the influence of lateral heat currrents through the wall on the fluid flow [ @xcite ] .",
    "the present project was designed to provide data that are not uncertain due to a significant side - wall correction .",
    "we used a classical fluid of relatively large conductivity confined by side walls of relatively low conductivity .",
    "the system of choice was water confined by plexiglas with various heights @xmath25 , and with the greatest diameter permitted by other constraints .",
    "we built four convection cells , three with @xmath51 cm with heights @xmath52 , 74.42 , and 50.61 cm , and one with @xmath53 cm and @xmath54 cm .",
    "for the @xmath39 ( @xmath55 ) cell , which is most relevant to comparison with the theoretical model of gl , we estimated a wall correction [ using model 2 of @xcite ] of only 0.3% for @xmath56 and smaller corrections for larger @xmath1 .",
    "based on this estimate we felt justified in neglecting the correction .",
    "a second experimental problem was pointed out recently by @xcite and by @xcite . using direct numerical simulation",
    ", @xcite showed that end plates of finite conductivity diminish the heat transport in the fluid when the nusselt number becomes large . in a separate paper",
    "we shall give details of the apparatus used in our work [ @xcite ] .",
    "there we will describe measurements using two types of top and bottom plates of identical shape and size , but one set made of copper with a conductivity @xmath57 w / m k and the other of aluminum with @xmath58 w / m k. that work yielded a correction factor that has been applied to the data reported here .",
    ".results for @xmath16 and @xmath53 cm . in this and all following data tables",
    "two points are listed per line , and they are numbered in chronological sequence . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "details of the apparatus and of experimental procedures are given by @xcite .",
    "the precision of the measurements is typically near 0.1 percent , and systematic errors , primarily due to uncertainties of the diameter and length of the cell , are estimated to be well below one percent .",
    "deviations from the boussinesq approximation are believed to be unimportant [ @xcite ] .",
    "we give the results in tables  [ 0.28cu ] to [ table:1.0cu ] .",
    "the measured @xmath0 derived from eq .  [ eq : nusselt ] as well as the nusselt number @xmath59 obtained after correction for the finite top- and bottom - plate conductivity [ @xcite ] are listed .",
    "the relation between these is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the ratio of the average thermal resistance of the plates to that of the fluid .",
    "we used the empirical function @xmath62 $ ] , with the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath11 , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 , determined experimentally [ @xcite ] .",
    "the parameters were found to be independent of the aspect ratio but to depend on the plate diameter .",
    "the results for @xmath59 are shown on logarithmic scales in fig .",
    "[ fig : nusselt]a and with greater resolution in the compensated form @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nusselt]b .",
    "we note that over most of the range of @xmath1 the data for @xmath14 reveal very little if any dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath15 .",
    "recent considerations by @xcite had suggested a stronger @xmath15-dependence .",
    "earlier experimental data [ @xcite ] also suggested a stronger @xmath15 dependence ; but those results were influenced by side - wall and/or end - plate effects .",
    "note for instance that the side - wall correction made by @xcite considerably reduced the @xmath15 dependence originally seen by @xcite .",
    "similarly , our present results for @xmath0 reveal some dependence on @xmath15 , but the end - plate correction largely removes it .",
    "it is particularly noteworthy that the data for @xmath10 are not shifted significantly relative to those for @xmath47 because on the basis of the numerical calculations of @xcite one expects different structures for the lsf for these two cases .",
    "the data for @xmath16 are lower by about 2.5% , suggesting that a transition in the lsf structure may occur between @xmath10 and 0.275 .",
    "a second important feature of the data is their dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "locally , over a limited range , the measurements can be fit by the powerlaw @xmath69 for the effective exponent we found @xmath70 for @xmath71 near @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath47 near @xmath74 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nusselt2 ] , a single fit to most of the data for @xmath75 , and 0.43 yields @xmath76 .",
    "all these values are close to , but definitely less than , the asymptotic large-@xmath1 prediction @xmath21 of the gl model .",
    "however , they are larger by about 0.01 or 0.015 than the gl prediction for @xmath71 at the same @xmath1 .",
    "this can also be seen qualitatively from fig .",
    "[ fig : nusselt]b where the gl prediction with its present parameter values is shown as a solid line .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the model parameters can be adjusted so as to reproduce this feature .",
    "another interesting aspect noticeable in fig .",
    "[ fig : nusselt]b is that for @xmath39 , 0.67 , and 0.43 there is a seemingly sudden change in the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath59 at large @xmath1 to a power law with @xmath21 , i.e. with the asymptotic prediction of the gl model .",
    "this is illustrated more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : nusselt2 ] which shows the relevant data with higher resolution .",
    "it is difficult to see how the gl model can reproduce this rather sudden transition at finite @xmath1 to its asymptotic exponent value .",
    "rather , it seems likely that a new physical phenomenon not yet contained in the model will have to be invoked .",
    "the transition occurs for @xmath75 , and 0.43 near @xmath77 , and @xmath78 respectively and is reflected in the observation that the data for larger @xmath1 fall on horizontal lines in the figures . in this range",
    "the measurements do reveal a dependence on @xmath15 , with @xmath79 , and 0.0595 for @xmath75 , and 0.43 respectively .",
    "one interpretation of these results for @xmath80 is that the heat transport is diminished , albeit only very slightly , by a larger travel distance , and presumably a larger period , of the lsf . at smaller @xmath1 an effective powerlaw with @xmath81 ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : nusselt2 ] ) fits the data at all three @xmath15 values within their statistical uncertainty , showing that the results are essentially @xmath15 independent .",
    "it is a surprise that the data for @xmath47 and 0.43 do not differ more from each other because different structures for the lsf had been predicted for these two cases .",
    "[ @xcite ] the @xmath16 results do indeed have a nusselt number that is smaller by about 2 to 3% , suggesting that the transition in the flow structure occurred between @xmath10 and 0.275 .",
    "those result do not show the saturation at large @xmath1 with @xmath82 , and lead to @xmath83 over their entire range .",
    "the nusselt number @xmath84 has a broad maximum near @xmath85 .",
    "thus the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath35 is very weak and difficult to determine from measurements with various fluids of different @xmath35 because of systematic errors due the uncertainties of the fluid properties [ @xcite ] .",
    "we determined @xmath86 with high precision over a narrow range of @xmath35 by using the same convection cell and by changing the mean temperature . in that case errors from different cell geometries are largely absent and the properties are known very well .",
    "similar measurements over the ranges @xmath87 and @xmath88 were made by @xcite .",
    "their results can be represented well by @xmath89 with @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the negative value of @xmath93 indicates that the maximum of @xmath94 is below @xmath95 .",
    "we used our @xmath47 cell and made measurements at 30 , 40 , and 50@xmath45c corresponding to @xmath96 , 4.38 , and 3.62 respectively .",
    "the results are included in table  [ table:0.67cu ] , and in the compensated form @xmath97 they are shown as a function of @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n_of_prandtl]a . over the range",
    "@xmath98 they yield @xmath99 , indicating that also for this range of @xmath1 the maximum of @xmath94 occurs below @xmath100 . the reduced nusselt number @xmath101 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n_of_prandtl]b .",
    "it shows that the data , within their experimental uncertainty , collapse onto a unique curve when divided by @xmath102 .",
    "the observed @xmath35-dependence is somewhat stronger than that of the gl model with its present parameter values",
    ".      measurements of @xmath50 for @xmath103 over the range @xmath104 and a wide range of @xmath35 were made at cryogenic temperatures using gaseous helium by @xcite .",
    "a direct , highly quantitative comparison with our results is possible only for the data points with @xmath35-values fairly close to ours where the @xmath35-dependence of @xmath0 can reasonably be expected to be given by eq .",
    "[ eq : powerlaw ] with @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : others]a we show results of @xcite for @xmath101 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "these data were corrected by the authors for the side - wall conductance , using a procedure described by them . because of the small conductivity of helium gas one expects end - plate corrections to be negligible in this case .",
    "we also show our results for comparison .",
    "one sees that the data of @xcite fall into three well defined groups , with a nearly uniform vertical spacing between them of close to four percent .",
    "there is excellent agreement / consistency of the uppermost branch with our data for @xmath39 , 0.67 , and 0.43 .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of any significant aspect - ratio dependence in our data .",
    "the existence of the lower two branches is more difficult to reconcile with our results .",
    "@xcite suggest that they encountered more than one distinct state of their lsf . in our work",
    "we never found multi - stability for any @xmath15 , and the data for @xmath47 and 0.43 ( which according to the calculations of @xcite should correspond to different flow structures ) agree with each other and are consistent with the upper branch of roche et al .",
    ", at least in the range where @xmath18 has not yet saturated at @xmath82 .",
    "our data for @xmath44 are lower than those for our larger @xmath15 , suggesting a difference in the lsf and indicating that the transition from a single cell to a more complicated structure occurs at @xmath105 in our system .",
    "however , our results for @xmath44 are only about 2 or 3 % lower than the larger-@xmath15 data and not as low as the results from the middle or lower branch of roche et al .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : others]b we compare our results with those of @xcite from cryogenic experiments for @xmath106 and @xmath103 .",
    "the end - plate corrections are expected to be negligible .",
    "because of the low conductivity of the fluid , the side - wall contribution to the conductance of the cell is significant , but apparently no correction was made .",
    "the authors interpret their data to imply @xmath107 , and attribute the large value to a breakdown of the boundary layers adjacent to the top and bottom plates . in that case one",
    "expects that a new regime first proposed by @xcite with an asymptotic exponent @xmath108 ( and logarithmic corrections ) should be entered .",
    "our data do not reveal such a large exponent , and in the overlapping range @xmath109 remain consistent with @xmath82 .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : heliumdata ] we compare our results for @xmath110 and 0.43 ( solid circles where @xmath111 and stars where @xmath112 ) and @xmath44 ( solid squares ) on a less sensitive vertical scale with several measurements at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "a more comprehensive comparison was presented by @xcite ( ns ) [ we choose the same representation in terms of @xmath113 that was used by them in their fig .  5 ] .",
    "there are systematic differences between the data sets that are , according to ns , larger than possible systematic errors in the experiments .",
    "our data show very little change of @xmath18 with @xmath1 , and the solid circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : heliumdata ] yield @xmath114 .",
    "the data by ns ( connected open circles ) show a dependence on @xmath1 that differs from ours , with @xmath18 varying from about 0.28 to about 0.35 as @xmath1 changes from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "the data of @xcite do not show such a strong variation of @xmath18 and can be described well by a single @xmath117 over the @xmath1-range of the figure .",
    "the data of @xcite ( open diamonds ) are on average slightly larger than ours but have an @xmath1-dependence that is consistent with that of ours .",
    "we have been unable to rationalize the large variations of the effective exponents of @xmath0 from one experiment to another , and in the case of the data of ns within a single experiment with @xmath1 , in terms of known fluid mechanics .",
    "ns suggested that differences in the lsf structure are responsible , and state that  such differences seem to arise from delicate interplay among detailed geometry as well as prandtl and rayleigh numbers \" .",
    "looking at our data , the absence of any significant @xmath15-dependence is apparent from the clustering of the data for @xmath14 ( solid circles ) near the straight dash - dotted line corresponding to @xmath118 ; i.e. @xmath15 _ per se _ does not play a major role . even for @xmath44 , where the data are displaced vertically in the figure , presumably because of a change in the lsf , they have nearly the same effective exponent @xmath119 ( dotted line ) .",
    "thus it appears from our data that differences in the lsf do not have a large effect on the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath120 .",
