    "the algebraic theory of quadratic forms will soon celebrate its 75th birthday .",
    "indeed , it was 1937 when witt s pioneering paper @xcite  a mere 14 pages  first introduced many beautiful results that we love so much today .",
    "these results form the foundation for the algebraic theory of quadratic forms .",
    "in particular they describe the construction of the witt ring itself .",
    "thus the cute little baby ,  the algebraic theory of quadratic forms \" was healthy and screaming with joy , making his father ernst witt very proud .",
    "grandma emmy noether , had she still been alive , would have been so delighted to see this little tyke !",
    "almost right near the beginning , this precocious baby was telling us the essential fact needed to construct the witt ring of quadratic forms over an arbitrary field .",
    "this result , originally satz 4 in @xcite , is now formulated as the witt cancellation theorem , and it is the technical heart of witt s brilliant idea to study the collection of _ all _ quadratic forms over a given field as a single algebraic entity . prior to witt",
    "s paper , quadratic forms were studied one at a time .",
    "however witt showed that a certain collection of quadratic forms under an equivalence relation can be equipped with the structure of a commutative ring .",
    "indeed , satz 6 says :     _ die klassen hnlicher formen bilden einen ring _ \"    which means ,  the classes of similar forms , form a ring . \" in order to honor witt s contributions , this ring is now called the _ witt ring_.",
    "the witt ring remains a central object of study , even 75 years after its birth .",
    "building on voevodsky s fields medal winning work from 2002 , orlov , vishik and voevodsky recently settled milnor s conjecture @xcite on quadratic forms , which is a deep statement about the structure of the witt ring .",
    "this work uses sophisticated tools from algebraic geometry and homotopy theory to provide a complete set of invariants for quadratic forms , extending the classical invariants known to witt @xcite , including dimension , discriminant and the clifford invariant .",
    "in addition to its crucial role in defining the witt ring , the witt cancellation theorem also has other important applications , such as establishing sylvester s law of inertia , which classifies quadratic forms over the field of real numbers .",
    "clearly the witt cancellation theorem is special and therefore deserves further analysis .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present a transparent and algebraic proof to complement the classical geometric proof , and then carefully compare the two approaches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we state the witt cancellation theorem , guide the reader towards our proof of the cancellation theorem , and then present the proof itself . a geometric approach to witt cancellation , based on hyperplane reflections , is presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we provide a  homotopy \" ( a gentle deformation ) between the algebraic and geometric approaches . using witt cancellation as the key , we review the construction of the witt ring of quadratic forms in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we present an informal overview of the milnor conjectures on quadratic forms and some recent related developments . in section 7",
    "we reveal an interesting surprise .",
    "section 8 , the epilogue , is a tribute to several great mathematicians connected with our story .",
    "the epilogue also contains a challenge for our readers .",
    "all sections , except possibly section 6 , can be read profitably by any undergraduate student who is familiar with basic linear algebra .",
    "we begin with some preliminaries . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that our base field @xmath0 has characteristic not equal to @xmath1 .",
    "there are several equivalent definitions of a quadratic form .",
    "the following is probably the most commonly used definition .",
    "an @xmath2-ary _ quadratic form _ @xmath3 over @xmath0 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath1 in @xmath2 variable over @xmath0 : @xmath4 it is customary to render the coefficients symmetric by writing @xmath5 therefore @xmath6 ( this is possible because the characteristic of our field is not @xmath1 . )    if we view @xmath7 as a column vector , and its transpose @xmath8 as a row vector , then we can write @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an @xmath11 matrix .",
    "in other words , we associate @xmath3 with a symmetric matrix @xmath12 which also defines a symmetric bilinear form on @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "two @xmath2-ary quadratic forms @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 are _ equivalent _ , or _ isometric _",
    "if for some non - singular @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 we have @xmath19 in this case we write @xmath20 .",
    "recall that two symmetric matrices @xmath21 and @xmath12 are said to be _ congruent _ if there exist and invertible matrix @xmath18 such that @xmath22 .",
    "equivalence classes of quadratic forms thus correspond to congruence classes of symmetric matrices . over the field @xmath23 of real numbers . what is the conic section that is represented by the equation @xmath24 ?",
    "the given quadratic form is equivalent over @xmath23 to the form @xmath25 .",
    "the equivalence is given by the equations @xmath26 it is clear that the new equation @xmath27 represents an ellipse , and therefore so does the original equation . ]",
    "the following useful result is well known and can be found in any standard textbook on quadratic forms ; see for example @xcite or @xcite .    an @xmath2-ary quadratic form over a field @xmath0 of characteristic not equal to @xmath1",
    "is equivalent to a diagonal form , i.e. , a form that is equal to @xmath28 for some field elements @xmath29 .    for brevity we shall denote the diagonal quadratic form @xmath28 by @xmath30",
    "in view of this theorem it is enough to study diagonal forms over @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that our diagonal quadratic forms are _ non - degenerate _ ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath31 for @xmath32 . the number @xmath2 is called the dimension of @xmath3 .",
    "in this section we will present a transparent and algebraic proof of the witt cancellation theorem to complement the classical geometric proof .",
    "the following is the simplest form of the witt cancellation theorem .",
    "other general statements can be easily derived from this simple form .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be non - degenerate @xmath2-ary quadratic forms over a field @xmath0 of characteristic not equal to @xmath1 , with @xmath35 , and assume that @xmath36 .",
    "if there is an isometry @xmath37 , then there is another isometry @xmath38 .    before presenting our proof",
    ", we will explain the key idea in such a way that the reader may build the proof before even reading it  a _ guided self - discovery _ approach .",
    "witt s cancellation theorem essentially says that we may  cancel \" a common term , @xmath39 , from both sides of a given isometry , in order to obtain a new isometry .",
    "we want a proof that reflects this cancellation directly . to this end ,",
    "recall that by the definition of isometry , there is an invertible linear transformation @xmath40 which takes @xmath16 to @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the isometry @xmath41 becomes a polynomial identity in the @xmath2 variables @xmath42 after using the @xmath2 transformations in equation ( [ key ] ) .",
    "our idea then is to simply take this one step further , by substituting @xmath43 with a carefully chosen linear combination of the remaining @xmath44 variables @xmath45 so that in equation ( [ key2 ] ) , the first term on the left hand side will cancel with the first term on the right hand side .",
    "this will then give us our desired isometry .",
    "so we now ask : what is this magical substitution ?",
    "in other words , which linear combination do we use for @xmath43 ?",
    "if @xmath46 is the answer to this question , then it should satisfy the equation @xmath47 however , since @xmath36 , it is sufficient that our @xmath46 satisfy @xmath48 note that this last equation reminds us of exciting , good old times from high school where we learned how to solve linear equations : @xmath49    after this motivational warm - up , it is now time to give a formal proof .",
    "the reader will see that our proof will be quite transparent and will be based on the simple identity :    @xmath50        _ proof ( of the witt cancellation theorem ) .",
    "_ since @xmath37 , we can write @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an @xmath11 invertible matrix over @xmath0 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 from @xmath55 to @xmath2 .",
    "we first argue that @xmath56 can be assumed without loss of generality to be not equal to @xmath55 . as a matter of fact , if @xmath57 , then we replace @xmath58 with @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "this changes @xmath61 to @xmath62 . however , that does not effect equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "so we assume without loss of generality that @xmath63 .    to prove our theorem",
    "we would like to cancel the first terms ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) on either sides of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) . to do this , in equation [ eq1 ] we make the substitution @xmath66 where @xmath67 note that this is a valid substitution because @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , this substitution expresses @xmath43 as a linear combination of @xmath45 .",
    "this substitution , in conjunction with the assumption @xmath36 and our identity ( [ eq0 ] ) , gives the following equations .",
    "@xmath68 therefore we can cancel these two terms in our original equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , which now reduces to one in @xmath69 variables : @xmath70 in this new equation , for @xmath71 , @xmath72 is expressed as a linear combination of @xmath73 , say @xmath74 .",
    "it remains to show that this linear transformation is invertible . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath75 be the change - of - coordinates matrix which corresponds to our linear transformation @xmath76 .",
    "then the transformation between the @xmath77-ary forms @xmath78 and @xmath79 is given by the matrix equation @xmath80 where @xmath21 and @xmath12 are the diagonal matrices representing the forms @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "taking determinants on both sides of the last equation , we get @xmath83 since @xmath84 is non - degenerate , @xmath85 is non - zero and therefore @xmath86 is also non - zero .",
    "this shows that @xmath87 is invertible .",
    "thus we have shown that the forms @xmath84 and @xmath88 are isometric .",
    "@xmath89    in the above proof , we see that the witt cancellation theorem actually follows from the formal algebraic cancellation of like terms in a polynomial identity , explaining the title of our paper .",
    "in this section we present the standard , coordinate - free , geometric approach to quadratic forms and the witt cancellation theorem .",
    "a _ quadratic space _ is a finite - dimensional @xmath0-vector space equipped with a symmetric bilinear form @xmath90 the associated quadratic form @xmath91 is obtained by setting @xmath92 .",
    "the bilinear form @xmath12 can be recovered from @xmath3 because of the identity @xmath93 as one can easily check . therefore a quadratic space can be denoted by @xmath94 , or equivalently by @xmath95 .",
    "coordinate free definitions in quadratic form theory are naturally analogous to their coordinate counterparts .",
    "for instance , an _ isometry _ between @xmath96 and @xmath97 is a linear isomorphism @xmath98 such that @xmath99 for all @xmath100 and @xmath101 in @xmath102 .",

    "given two quadratic spaces @xmath107 and @xmath108 , there is a natural quadratic from on the space @xmath109 which is defined by @xmath110 this quadratic space is denoted by @xmath111    the geometric form of the witt cancellation theorem in its simplest form can now be stated as follows .",
    "[ wittcancellation - geometric ] let @xmath95 be an @xmath2-dimensional non - degenerate quadratic form with @xmath112 , and let @xmath113 and @xmath114 be two orthogonal bases for @xmath95 .",

    "* page 13 ) .",
    "in fact , this map is the reflection in the plane perpendicular to @xmath118 . a key ingredient in the proof of theorem [ wittcancellation - geometric ] is the following hyperplane reflection lemma .",

    "* proof of theorem 3.1 * we are given that @xmath115 .",

    "the goal of this section is to exhibit a  homotopy \" between these two approaches .",
    "more precisely , we will show that our substitution in equation ( [ substitution ] ) @xmath148 naturally corresponds to the hyperplane reflection mentioned in the previous section .",
    "let us quickly recapitulate the framework :    * @xmath95 is an @xmath2-dimensional non - degenerate quadratic form .",

    "* for all @xmath54 , @xmath153 is obtained from @xmath154 after replacing @xmath43 with our substitution , which is a linear combination of @xmath45 .",

    "the isometry between @xmath158 and @xmath159 is given by an invertible matrix @xmath52 .",
    "the change of basis matrix is then @xmath18 .",
    "so we have for @xmath160 , @xmath161    for the rest of this section , we fix an integer @xmath162 . before going",
    "further we explain our strategy for getting the  homotopy .",
    "\" we take a vector @xmath163 and hit it with our hyperplane reflection @xmath142 .",
    "then we express @xmath164 as a linear combination of @xmath165 . by comparing the coefficient @xmath166 of @xmath167 in @xmath164 and the coefficient @xmath168 of @xmath169 in @xmath170 for @xmath71 , and we will see the equivalence of the two approaches .    to execute this strategy ,",
    "consider the vector @xmath171 .",
    "since @xmath172 , we have @xmath173 ( here we are using the identity @xmath174 which comes from unwinding the equation @xmath175 . ) by replacing @xmath136 with @xmath137 if necessary , we may assume that @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , @xmath119 .",

    "let us show how one can see almost instantly that our substitution in section 2 corresponds to the hyperplane reflection above .",

    "but when one reflects on the corresponding map ( related to our substitution ) @xmath190 one sees that @xmath191 where @xmath192 is a uniquely determined element of @xmath0 such that the projection of @xmath193 on the line through @xmath136 is @xmath194 . since our image of reflection @xmath187 already has this property , we see that @xmath195 and @xmath196 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have seen that our substitution @xmath197 amounts to reflecting vectors in the plane orthogonal to the vector @xmath118 , i.e. , sending @xmath185 to @xmath198 .",
    "thus , we have established a  homotopy \" between the algebraic and geometric approaches .",
    "in this section we will define the witt ring of quadratic forms .",
    "as we will see , the witt cancellation theorem will be the key for constructing the witt ring .",
    "some terminology is in order .",
    "we refer the reader to the excellent books by lam @xcite for a thorough treatment .",
    "other good references on this subject include @xcite .",
    "let @xmath94 be a quadratic space and let @xmath3 be the corresponding quadratic form . for simplicity",
    "we often drop @xmath12 and @xmath3 and denote a quadratic space by @xmath102 .",
    "recall that a quadratic space @xmath94 is said to be _ non - degenerate _ if the induced map @xmath199 is the zero map only when @xmath200 .",
    "it is not hard to show that any quadratic space @xmath94 splits as @xmath201 where @xmath202 is non - degenerate , and @xmath203 is the subspace of @xmath102 consisting of all vectors in @xmath102 which are orthogonal to all vectors of @xmath102 . in particular , the restriction of the bilinear form @xmath12 on @xmath203 is identically @xmath194 .",
    "therefore there is no harm in restricting to non - degenerate quadratic spaces .",
    "we say that a non - degenerate quadratic space @xmath94 is _ isotropic _ if there is a non - zero vector @xmath204 such that @xmath205 . it can be shown @xcite that every isotropic form contains a hyperbolic plane as a summand , where , by definition , a hyperbolic plane is a two dimensional form that is equivalent to @xmath206 .",
    "note that @xmath207 is short for @xmath208 .",
    "this form @xmath3 is isotropic as @xmath209 .",
    "thus we see that a non - degenerate quadratic form @xmath102 is isotropic if and only if @xmath102 has a hyperbolic plane as a summand .",
    "now let us consider a non - degenerate quadratic space @xmath94 . if @xmath102 is isotropic , then by the above mentioned fact we can write @xmath102 as @xmath210 where @xmath211 is a hyperbolic plane",
    ". if @xmath212 is also isotropic , we can further decompose it as @xmath213 where @xmath214 is a hyperbolic plane .",
    "we proceed in this manner as far as possible , to get a decomposition : @xmath215 where @xmath216 are hyperbolic planes and @xmath217 is anisotropic , i.e. , a form that is not isotropic .",
    "now here is where witt cancellation comes into play .",
    "the integer @xmath60 ( the number of hyperbolic planes in the above decomposition ) is seen to be uniquely determined , using the witt cancellation theorem .",
    "furthermore , the isometry class of the anisotropic part @xmath217 is uniquely determined , which also follows from the witt cancellation theorem . in summary ,",
    "every non - degenerate quadratic space @xmath94 admits a unique decomposition called the _",

    "two quadratic spaces @xmath102 and @xmath220 are said to be _ similar _ if their anisotropic parts are equivalent .",
    "again , the witt cancellation theorem ensures that this notion of similarity is well - defined .    with these definitions and concepts ,",
    "we are now ready to define the witt ring of quadratic forms @xmath221 over the field @xmath0 , which is a central object in the algebraic theory of quadratic forms",

    "the background required for these deep , very recent papers is quite extensive , so the ambitious reader will no doubt have lots of fun delving into many _ extra _ references , including those found in the references of the papers we cite .",
    "after essentially completing our article we kept searching for historical references on quadratic forms .",
    "we were astounded to find a conference proceeding article @xcite by w. scharlau entitled , ",
    "_ on the history of the algebraic theory of quadratic forms .",
    "_ \" scharlau explains that the algebraic theory of quadratic forms could have been born 30 years earlier !",
    "namely , in 1907 l. dickson published a paper @xcite in which he proved a number of results on quadratic forms including the cancellation theorem which witt proved independently 30 years later in 1937 .",
    "in fact , scharlau writes :  ... _ it seems that dickson s paper went completely unnoticed ; i could not find a single reference to it in the literature .",
    "however , one must admit that this paper ",
    "like most of dickson s work  is not very pleasant to read ... nevertheless , i believe that , as far as witt s theorem and related questions are concerned , some credit should be given to dickson . _ \" therefore , one might say that the algebraic theory of quadratic forms was _ conceived _ in 1907 , but was nt _ born _ until 1937 .",
    "if only emmy noether , her graduate student ernst witt and leonard dickson were here to help us celebrate this birthday .",
    "we can not know exactly what they would say , but we may still imagine the party that is going on in the elysian field of mathematical giants .",
    "emmy noether is running around full of energy , leading a lively and challenging mathematical discussion .",
    "one could hardly believe that she was born 130 years ago !",
    "there are other mathematicians including david hilbert , who are taking interest in the discussions at the party .",
    "* noether * : this bloch - kato conjecture is finally solved , and its proof is just beautiful .",
    "we have come so far since the early days of cyclic algebras and cross - products . ah !",
    "dickson , what a shame that your brilliant paper on quadratic forms from 1907 did not get the attention it deserved .",
    "just imagine how much further we would have come had people studied it from the very beginning .",
    "please rewrite it , with more emphasis on the concepts to illuminate the calculations .",
    "* dickson * : rewrite a brilliant paper ?",
    "you are just as strict as i had heard _ and by the way  it has been over a century since i wrote that paper ! _",
    "i hardly remember it now .",
    "i do finally have some free time on my hands to recall those ideas . in any case",
    ", it may well be a blessing that it was not popular at the beginning . who knows if witt would have developed his elegant geometrical approach if everyone knew about my original paper ?",
    "* noether : * my earnest boy , you certainly do know how to provide a short answer .",
    "and i have missed your wit .",
    "but seriously , we should spend the next several meetings working on this bloch - kato conjecture .",
    "although the proof just provided by rost and voevodsky is truly amazing , we can always strive towards a more elementary proof in the hopes of making it less mysterious .",
    "perhaps we should write a book ?      * witt * : i too would love to work on this .",
    "it does indeed seem a bit mysterious that the statements of the milnor conjecture and the bloch - kato conjecture can be formulated using quadratic forms , group cohomology and field theory , yet their current proofs require so much more material",
    ". we must think about what this means for galois theory .",
