    "one of the main challenges in magnetic fusion research has been the prediction of the turbulent heat and particle transport originating from various micro - instabilities .",
    "the ion - temperature - gradient ( itg ) mode is one of the main candidates for causing the anomalous heat transport in core plasmas of tokamaks  @xcite .",
    "significant heat transport can however be mediated by coherent structures such as streamers and blobs through the formation of avalanche like events of large amplitude , as indicated by recent numerical studies  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "these events cause the deviation of the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) from a gaussian profile on which the traditional mean field theory ( such as transport coefficients ) is based .",
    "a crucial question in plasma confinement is thus the prediction of the pdfs of the transport due to these structures and of their formation  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "note that a renormalized perturbative theory can easily make an considerably large error in predicting pdfs where the coherent structures are crucial .    in previous papers the hasegawa - mima model of drift wave turbulence was used to show that the pdf tails of global momentum flux and heat flux are significantly enhanced over the gaussian prediction  @xcite-  @xcite ; this was later shown to hold also in itg mode turbulence  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the tails of pdf of global momentum flux and heat flux have been shown to be stretched exponential with the form @xmath7",
    "@xcite-  @xcite , which is broader than a gaussian .",
    "these results provided a novel explanation for exponential pdf tails of momentum flux found in recent experiments at csdx at ucsd  @xcite .",
    "note that considerable transport can be mediated by rare events of high amplitude at the pdf tails even if the latter have a low amplitude . since the pdf tails of momentum flux are enhanced over the gaussian prediction in this case ,",
    "these events are more likely to mediate considerable transport .",
    "in fact , it was found that for certain values of parameters , large events are crucial for transport .",
    "specifically , the overall amplitude was shown to be larger in itg than in hm turbulence for reversed modon speed ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the pdf tail of zonal flow in itg turbulence was also significantly increased compared to that in hm turbulence .",
    "furthermore , zonal flows are shown to be generated more likely further from marginal stability , which will then regulate itg turbulence , leading to a self - regulating system .",
    "namely , while itg turbulence is a state with high level of heat flux , it also generates stronger zonal flows that inhibit transport .",
    "this also suggested that stronger zonal flows are generated in itg turbulence compared with etg turbulence .",
    "it was also shown that shear flows can significantly reduce the pdf tails of reynolds stress and zonal flow formation  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the likelihood of the formation of coherent structures by computing the pdf ( tails ) of zonal flow formation and the pdfs of momentum flux  @xcite by using the two different itg turbulence models .",
    "the first model is a widely applicable five field model ( @xmath0 ) of the itg turbulence coupled to an ion vorticity equation for the zonal flows . for the computation of the pdfs",
    ", a reductive perturbation method is used to obtain dynamical equations for drift waves and zonal flows . due to the perturbation method",
    ", this model is only valid for weak drift wave and zonal flow electric potential . moreover",
    "an exact non - linear solution in this model is not available that can be used as an ansatz for a coherent structure for the intermittent transport .",
    "however , the computation of the pdf tails requires only mean values over the coherent structures .",
    "the second is the two field ( @xmath1 ) model which has an exact non - linear bipolar vortex soliton ( modon ) solution that will be utilized in the computing pdfs .",
    "note that the two - field fluid model for the itg mode  @xcite-  @xcite has been successful in reproducing both experimental  @xcite and non - linear gyro - kinetic results  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical technique used here is the so - called instanton method , a non - perturbative way of calculating the pdf tails .",
    "the pdf tail is first formally expressed in terms of a path integral by utilizing the gaussian statistics of an external forcing with a short correlation time .",
    "an optimum path will then be associated with the creation of a coherent structure ( among all possible paths ) and the action is evaluated using the saddle - point method . in the second model",
    "this coherent structure is identified as the modon .",
    "the saddle - point solution of the dynamical variable @xmath9 of the form @xmath10 with @xmath11 which is localized in time is called an instanton .",
    "since the instanton exists during the formation of the coherent structure , the bursty event can be associated with the creation of a coherent structure .",
    "note that the function @xmath12 here represents the spatial form of the coherent structure .",
    "one of our main results is that the pdf tail of the zonal flow formation is @xmath13 , ( @xmath14 to denote the different constants in the two models ) , in agreement with earlier findings  @xcite .",
    "interestingly the predicted pdf tails of momentum flux are gaussian when the feedback of zonal flow on the turbulence is incorporated .",
    "this result differs from what has theoretically been found earlier  @xcite whereas it is in agreement with predictions from non - linear simulations of turbulence  @xcite-  @xcite and gyro - kinetic toroidal simulations  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that previously the zonal flow has been treated as passively evolving by the turbulence without the feedback loop to turbulence .",
    "this feedback gives a cubic non - linearity in eq .",
    "( 7 ) describing the itg fluctuations which changes the characteristics of the turbulence .",
    "physically , it is because the feedback of zonal flow regulates turbulence , limiting its growth from turbulence .",
    "the result from both models support the conclusion that while itg turbulence maintains high level of transport , this may be suppressed by shear flow .",
    "zonal flows are also shown here to have an enhanced likelihood of the generation further from marginal stability which will then regulate the itg turbulence ( which is more prominent with increased shear flow ) leading to a self - regulating system .",

    "the pdf tails of zonal flow is @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 represent the different constants depending on the models ) which corroborate earlier findings  @xcite-  @xcite .    in the first part a general five field model ( @xmath0 ) where a reductive perturbation method is used to derive dynamical equations for drift waves and a zonal flow",
    "is studied .",
    "interestingly the predicted pdf tails of momentum flux in the five field model of itg turbulence are gaussian when the feedback of zonal flow on the turbulence is incorporated .",
    "this result differs from what has theoretically been found earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite and found in the reduced two field model of itg turbulence in sec .",
    "v whereas it is in agreement with predictions from non - linear simulations of turbulence  @xcite-  @xcite and in gyro - kinetic toroidal simulations  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "mathematically it is due to the different highest non - linearity between the two models ( i.e. cubic in the five - field model and quadratic in the two field model ) .",
    "physically , it is because in the two - field model the feedback of zonal flow on the fluctuations was not treated self - consistently , which will regulate turbulence , inhibiting its growth .",
    "note that non - linear models with cubic non - linearities for the turbulence fluctuations was obtained perturbatively and thus valid only for small values of the amplitude ( small @xmath120 ) .",
    "the statistical property of the fluctuations differs in systems with cubic and quadratic non - linearities . to elucidate these differences",
    "it is instructive to discuss a general formula for pdf tails of any moment in non - linear systems derived previously  @xcite . by using the instanton method ,",
    "the pdf of the m - th moment was shown to be @xmath188 in the case where @xmath189 is the highest non - linearity in a dynamical system .",
    "for instance , in the case of the five - field model , @xmath190 [ eq .",
    "( 9 ) ] while in the case of the two - field model , @xmath191 [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] . for pdfs of momentum flux , @xmath192 while for pdfs of zonal flow formation @xmath193 .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( 72)-(73 ) there is a significant difference in the pdf tails of the first moment in a system with cubic non - linearity where @xmath194 and one with a quadratic non - linearity where @xmath195  @xcite . for weak zonal flow eq .",
    "( 7 ) becomes linear and we expect gaussian statistics ( @xmath5 ) for the fluctuations",
    ". note that for the five - field model , eq .",
    "( 72)-(73 ) suggest that the pdf tails of zonal flow formation are determined by the quadratic non - linearity in the dynamical equation for the zonal flow whereas the cubic non - linearity determines the pdf tails of momentum flux .",
    "finally , in the second part a reduced two - field model ( @xmath1 ) that has an exact non - linear solution ( bipolar vortex soliton ) of itg turbulence and zonal flows are studied to compute the pdfs of zonal flow formation and momentum flux .",
    "one of the important results from the numerical study in this reduced two - field model , which is also supported in the five field model , is that shear flows can significantly reduce the pdf tails of momentum flux and zonal flow formation .",
    "since zonal flows are more likely to be generated further from marginal stability , they will then regulate itg turbulence , leading to a self - regulating system .",
    "namely , while itg turbulence is a state with high level of heat flux , it also generates stronger zonal flows that inhibit transport .",
