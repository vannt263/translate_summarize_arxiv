    "there is nothing unphysical about matter being localised in a region of space ; matter can simply exist at one location and not another .",
    "but for it to be localised in a finite period of time is altogether different . indeed ,",
    "as the matter would exist only for that period and no other , the situation would be a direct violation of mass conservation . in conventional quantum mechanics , this undesirable situation",
    "is avoided axiomatically by requiring matter to be represented by a quantum state vector whose norm is fixed over time .",
    "there is , however , no corresponding restriction of the state vector over space .",
    "the underlying time - space asymmetry here can be traced to the fact that the state , and the matter it represents , is presumed to undergo continuous translation over time ( as time evolution ) but there is no corresponding presumption about the state undergoing translations over space . even in relativistic quantum field theory , where both time and space are treated equally as the coordinates of a spacetime background , a similar asymmetry holds because time evolution and conservation laws are presumed to operate differently over time and space .",
    "nevertheless , time and space could have an equivalent footing at a fundamental level if any asymmetry between them were to arise _ phenomenologically _ rather than being imposed axiomatically .",
    "such a prospect is well worth pursuing because it would help us to understand the relationship between time and space .",
    "it would require finding an underlying mechanism that , due to phenomenological conditions , affects the spatial and temporal translational degrees of freedom in different ways to the extent matter can be localised in space but not in time .",
    "this suggests that we should examine the phenomenological character of the operations associated with the translational degrees of freedom .",
    "the generators of translations in space and time are given by the momentum and hamiltonian operators , respectively , and with them lies a difference that sets space and time apart in the quantum regime .",
    "in fact , the last fifty years @xcite has shown that nature is not invariant to particular combinations of the discrete symmetry operations of charge conjugation ( c ) , parity inversion ( p ) and time reversal ( t ) .",
    "the violation of these discrete symmetries are observed in various particle decays independent of position in space , and so they occur over translations in time and not translations in space . in terms of the corresponding generators , this implies that the hamiltonian violates the discrete symmetries whereas the momentum operator does not .",
    "the discrete symmetry violations are accounted for in the standard model of particle physics by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .",
    "studies of the violations have been made in relation to baryogenesis in the early universe @xcite , the arrow of time and irreversibility @xcite , the time operator @xcite , quantum entanglement and bell inequalities @xcite , decay and decoherence @xcite , complementarity and quantum information @xcite , quantum walks @xcite , and the potential for t violation to have large scale physical effects @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite i modelled the state of the universe as a superposition of paths that zigzag through time , and showed that t violation can , in principle , affect the time evolution in a global way .",
    "then in ref .",
    "@xcite i showed that the effect on time evolution is greater when the paths are constructed in the limit of infinitely - small steps .    here",
    "we explore the potential impact the violations of the discrete symmetries may have for giving quantum states different representations in space and time .",
    "the aim is not to study specific instances of the violations as observed experimentally , but rather to look for possible consequences of the violations in general terms . for this , the definitions of the p and t operations given by wigner in relation to non - relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite are sufficient and so we shall undertake the analysis using the same theory as a basis .",
    "many previous studies have used the same framework @xcite .",
    "a relativistic analysis will be left for a future study .",
    "we will need , however , to depart from conventional quantum mechanics in three important ways .",
    "the justification for these departures lies in the eventually recovery of the conventional formalism under appropriate conditions .",
    "the first departure is that we will not impose any equation of motion , such as the schrdinger equation , on states because to do so would directly build in the asymmetry between time and space mentioned above .",
    "instead , we anticipate that an effective equation of motion will arise phenomenologically in some way .",
    "second , we will consider states that describe the location of a material object either in space or in time . while the location in space can simply be given by a wave function ,",
    "say @xmath0 , in the position representation , the location in time is quite unconventional as it would need to be given by a wave function , say @xmath1 , in what might be called the `` time representation '' . here , @xmath2 gives the probability density for the object being at time @xmath3 just as @xmath4 gives the probability density for the object being at position @xmath5 .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath1 violates mass conservation as it describes the object as having potential existence at the points in time where @xmath6 and definitely not existing at the points where @xmath7 .",
    "this lack of mass conservation is the price we must pay to keep the formalism symmetric with respect to time and space .",
    "nevertheless we anticipate that mass conservation will arise phenomenologically rather than being imposed on the formalism .",
    "the third departure from conventional quantum mechanics is that we need to include the p and t symmetry operations in the formalism explicitly , even in the situation where the corresponding symmetries are obeyed and the actions of p and t are redundant .",
    "this will ensure that we have a consistent formalism that operates both when the symmetries are obeyed and also when they are violated .",
    "the particular way in which we include the p and t discrete symmetry operators is motivated by the fact that they reverse the directions of spatial and temporal translations , respectively . a one - dimensional path in space that consists of a sequence of translations that alternate in direction",
    "can , therefore , be expressed explicitly in terms of parity inversions p. the same can be said for the t operation in relation to a sequence of time translations that alternate in direction .",
    "the roles that p and t play will be greater in mathematical constructions that involve a greater number of direction reversals .",
    "such constructions have the potential to display the effects of any discrete symmetry violation to a greater extent .",
    "feynman s path integral formalism immediately comes to mind as one that involves a superposition of all paths that zigzag through configuration space between two states .",
    "however , this formalism is inextricably associated with dynamics and thus is tied to the space - time asymmetry mentioned above .",
    "we need to develop a different approach if we are to keep time and space on an equal footing at a fundamental level .",
    "our approach is as follows .",
    "we will first consider the effects of p violation on spatial localisation .",
    "we will begin with a quantum state that represents some material object as being localised in space , and for this we will need the variance in the object s position to be finite .",
    "we will place no other constraint on the position and so we will need a quantum state that yields the least information about position ( and thus maximum entropy ) for a fixed variance ; the optimum pure state fitting this requirement has a gaussian wave function in the position representation @xcite .",
    "note that a classical particle undergoing a one - dimensional wiener process has a position probability density that is gaussian ; it too has trajectories that consist of infinitely many reversals in direction of the kind we have been considering . with this in mind",
    ", we will decompose the gaussian quantum state into a superposition of infinitely - many paths through space where each path has infinitely - many reversals in direction .",
    "the reversals in the direction of each path will be expressed explicitly in terms of the p symmetry operation and the translations in terms of the momentum operator .",
    "we will find that the violation of p symmetry has no effect on the construction .",
    "then , we will apply the same sum - over - paths construction to a quantum state that represents the object as being localised in time , but with the path reversals expressed explicitly in terms of the t symmetry operator and the translations in terms of the hamiltonian .",
    "using the same construction will ensure that _ the formalism is symmetric with respect to the representation of states of matter in both space and time _ when the discrete symmetries hold .",
    "the situation will be found to change dramatically when t symmetry is violated . only then will the formalism exhibit a time - space asymmetry that is consistent with conventional quantum mechanics . the important point to be made here",
    "is that the asymmetry will not be imposed on the formalism at a fundamental level , but rather it will arise _ phenomenologically _ due to the t violation .    given the fundamental character of the issues involved , one should not be surprised to find that to make any progress we need to pay due attention to quite subtle mathematical details .",
    "in particular , while the concept of the limit of an infinite sequence has rigorous meaning in a mathematical context , there is no _ a priori _ reason to suppose that it automatically carries a corresponding value in a theory that is designed to underpin experimental physics . after all ,",
    "the accuracy of observations made in experimental physics are always restricted by finite resources .",
    "for example , consider a theory in which the limit point @xmath8 of the convergent sequence @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( i.e. where @xmath13 as @xmath14 ) represents an experimental parameter , and let @xmath15 represent the experimental accuracy of measuring @xmath8 for a given level of resources .",
    "the convergence of the sequence implies that there exists a natural number @xmath16 that depends on @xmath15 for which @xmath17 for all @xmath18 , and so it is not possible to physically distinguish ( using the given resources ) the limit point @xmath8 from any of the terms @xmath19 for @xmath18 . under such circumstances ,",
    "the set @xmath20 would be more representative of the physical situation than just the limit point @xmath8 .",
    "set representations of this kind will be important for expressing quantum states in a manner which better represents their physical implications .",
    "the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows .",
    "we develop a sum - over - paths construction of a quantum state that is localised in space and examine the effects of the violation of p symmetry in section [ sec : construction ] .",
    "we apply the same construction to quantum states that are localised in time and examine the effects of the violation of t symmetry in section [ sec : applied to time ] . following that , in section [ sec :",
    "emergence ] , we show how the conventional schrdinger equation and conservation of mass emerge as a result of coarse graining over time , and explore how the new formalism might be tested experimentally .",
    "we end with a discussion in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we first need to develop the mathematical construction of quantum states that are localised in space and consist of a superposition of infinitely - many paths each of which has possibly infinitely - many reversals in direction . for this consider a simple 1-dimensional model universe composed of a single `` galaxy '' as our material object .",
    "the galaxy is representative of any spatially localised physical system with mass and could in fact be a star , a planet or just a single particle ; its details are not important for this study .",
    "the location of the galaxy is described by a set of observables that represent all its spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "imagine that at a particular time , each observable is in some localised state that is uncorrelated with respect to every other observable in the set .",
    "this will almost certainly result in the galaxy being far from its minimum energy state , however neither the energetics nor the dynamics are important in this section .",
    "also , because the same analysis applies to each observable , we will only treat one representative observable explicitly .",
    "let that observable be the centre of mass coordinate , which we assume to have a finite variance . as mentioned above ,",
    "the best choice for a pure state under these circumstances is one described by a gaussian wave function @xcite , which we write as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the eigenvalue and corresponding eigenstate of @xmath24 , the operator representing the @xmath22 component of the centre of mass position , and @xmath25 is a width parameter .",
    "this state can be written explicitly in terms of spatial translations as @xmath26 where operator representing the total momentum of the galaxy , @xmath27 , generates spatial translations according to @xmath28 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : translation](a ) . here , and throughout this paper , we use units in which @xmath29 . inserting the resolution of the identity @xmath30 into eq .",
    "gives @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the momentum basis .",
    "carrying out the fourier transform with respect to @xmath22 , yields @xmath33 and making use of the result @xmath34 then leads to @xmath35^n\\kern-1mm{|{0}\\rangle}_{\\rm x}\\ .\\ ] ]     axis and ( b ) the time axis . in ( a ) the wave functions",
    "represent the position eigenket @xmath23 and an arbitrary state @xmath36 and the translation is by a distance @xmath37 . in ( b )",
    "the wave function represents the state @xmath38 and the translation is by an interval @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : translation],width=302 ]    expanding the @xmath39-fold product in eq .",
    "gives a series of terms each of which comprise @xmath39 translations ( or `` steps '' ) of @xmath40 along the @xmath22 axis .",
    "for example , a term of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 , describes a path on the @xmath22 axis from the origin @xmath43 through the sequence of points @xmath8 , @xmath43 , @xmath8 , @xmath44 and so on , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : random path](a )",
    ". equation eq .   can be viewed , therefore , as a superposition of random paths away from the origin @xmath45 in the limit of infinitely small steps , and shares similarities with both quantum walks @xcite and feynman s sum over paths @xcite .",
    "note that here , however , the random path is traversed without reference to time , and so it should be considered to be traversed in a zero time interval .",
    "each random path is , therefore , a generalisation of the virtual displacements in dalembert s principle in classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "for this reason each individual path shall be called a _ random virtual path _ and the superposition of a set of random virtual paths like that in eq .   shall be called a _ quantum virtual path_.    , @xmath8 , @xmath43 , @xmath8 , @xmath44 on the @xmath22 axis . in (",
    "b ) four different virtual paths from @xmath43 to @xmath46 on the @xmath47 axis are represented in the tree by thick edges coloured yellow , red , blue and purple .",
    "[ fig : random path],width=302 ]    although they share similarities , a quantum virtual path is quite distinct from feynman s sum over paths @xcite . for example",
    ", feynman s method is used to calculate the probability amplitude for a system to evolve from one state to another .",
    "the paths represent potential classical trajectories between the same starting and ending points and the sum gives the total probability amplitude for evolving between the points .",
    "in contrast , a quantum virtual path represents a single state . the accumulated displacement over one random virtual path , like that in eq .  , gives a potential classical position of the system , and the whole quantum virtual path represents the state eq .   in terms of a distribution of potential classical positions .",
    "moreover , calculating the innerproduct of two states where one ( or both ) is represented by a quantum virtual path would result in a feynman - like sum over paths calculation .",
    "so in this sense , a quantum virtual path is a _ precursor _ of feynman s sum over paths .    the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is not the only way to decompose the state in eq .  .",
    "but what makes eq .",
    "special is that it consists of a superposition of an infinite number of continuous paths with the property that if one path is picked at random , it will effectively consist of a sequence of infinitesimal segments where each segment has an equal likelihood of representing a step in the positive or negative @xmath22 directions .",
    "the set of paths is unbiased with respect to direction in this sense .",
    "another feature that sets the decomposition in eq .",
    "apart is that it comprises all possible paths .",
    "the justification of why it should is that in decomposing the state in eq .   in terms of a superposition of paths",
    ", we have no reason for leaving out particular paths or , alternatively , for including only particular paths ; in the absence of such reasons all possible paths should be included .    as @xmath48 the step length @xmath49 in eq .",
    "will eventually breach the fundamental lower bound , say @xmath50 , that is expected for physically distinguishable positions .",
    "for example , there are reasons @xcite to believe that points in space are indistinguishable at the scale of the planck length @xmath51  m. let @xmath52 be the value of @xmath39 where the step length @xmath53 becomes equal to @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that the limit on the right side of eq .   can be replaced by a term corresponding to any value of @xmath39 larger than @xmath52 without any physically meaningful consequences",
    "there are an infinite number of such terms , each of which has an _ equal status _ in representing the state of the universe .",
    "they form the set @xmath55 where @xmath56^n\\kern-1mm{|{0}\\rangle}_{\\rm x}\\ .\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "we have written the translations explicitly in terms of the parity inversion operator @xmath57 .",
    "it has the property that @xmath58 which expresses the fact that a translation along the @xmath22 axis by @xmath59 ( left side of eq .  )",
    "can be produced by first performing a parity inversion , translating by @xmath60 and then reversing the parity inversion ( right side ) .",
    "every element in the set @xmath61 can serve equally well as a representation of the state in eq .",
    "as far as the physically - distinguishable spatial limit allows ; they all have equal status in this respect .    the mathematical construction represented by eq .",
    "and eq .   is in the form of the explicit translations and discrete symmetry operations that we need for comparing the difference between quantum states in space and time .",
    "although being equivalent to eq .  , we shall henceforth regard eq .   and eq .   as being a _ more fundamental _ description of the state of the galaxy due to this explicit form .",
    "note that the interpretation of eq .   in terms of quantum virtual paths does not hinge on the state @xmath45 being the eigenstate of position with zero eigenvalue .",
    "in fact any state @xmath36 with a variance in position very much smaller than @xmath62 ( and , correspondingly , a variance in total momentum very much larger than @xmath63 ) could be used in its place , in which case the steps in a path represent translations of @xmath36 along the @xmath22 axis , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : translation](a ) , rather than steps along the @xmath22 axis itself .",
    "while this situation allows some ambiguity in the formalism , it does not have any effect on results provided that corresponding adjustments to @xmath64 and @xmath25 are duly taken .",
    "given that the hamiltonian does not appear explicitly in the construction of spatial states , we should not expect to find any effects of discrete symmetry violation here .",
    "in particular , _ regardless of whether the galaxy obeys parity inversion symmetry or not _",
    "@xmath65 always holds , and so eq .   can be rewritten as a binomially weighted superposition of spatially translated states , i.e. @xmath66{|{0}\\rangle}_{\\rm x}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 in the large @xmath39 limit , @xmath68 tends to the gaussian state @xmath64 in eq .  , i.e. @xmath69 where @xmath70     as a function of the scaled position @xmath71 .",
    "the dots represent the exact values @xmath72 given by eq .",
    "and the solid curves represent the gaussian approximation @xmath73 given by eq .  .",
    "the abscissae for the discrete coefficients @xmath72 are given by @xmath74 in accord with eq .  . for clarity ,",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 have been scaled to give a maximum of unity , and the green ( @xmath75 ) and blue ( @xmath76 ) dots and curves have been displaced vertically by 0.2 and 0.4 , respectively . [",
    "fig : tinv],width=340 ]    figure [ fig : tinv ] compares the coefficients @xmath72 ( shown as dots ) with their large-@xmath39 limit @xmath73 ( continuous curves ) for a number of different @xmath39 values .",
    "the values of @xmath39 have been chosen purposely to exaggerate the discreteness of the state @xmath68 in comparison to the limiting state @xmath64 from eq .  .",
    "in truth , for every @xmath77 in eq .  , the values of @xmath39 are sufficiently large ( viz .",
    "@xmath78 ) that the dots representing @xmath72 for consecutive @xmath79 values are physically indistinguishable , and the locus of points representing @xmath72 is essentially equivalent to the curve @xmath73 up to a proportionality constant . as a consequence ,",
    "every @xmath77 is physically indistinguishable from the state @xmath64 in eq .  .",
    "we now use our construction to explore the temporal analogy of eq .   in which the galaxy is represented in time rather than space .",
    "we begin by recalling that the hamiltonian @xmath80 generates translations through time according to @xmath81 where @xmath38 and @xmath82 represent states at times differing by @xmath3 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : translation](b ) .",

    "the state @xmath91 plays the role of @xmath45 in eq .   and",
    "is assumed to be sharply defined in time and , correspondingly , to have a broad distribution in energy @xcite .",
    "more specifically , @xmath91 must have a variance in energy that is very much larger than @xmath92 in analogy with the requirement for any state @xmath36 to be used in place of @xmath45 .",
    "other details of @xmath91 are not crucial for our main results .",
    "it is perhaps worth elaborating a little on what is meant by @xmath91 being sharply defined in time given that there are well - known difficulties associated with defining an operator to represent time @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the absence of a universally accepted time operator does not prevent uncertainties in time from being physically meaningful .",
    "rather , we can use the fact that the hamiltonian is the generator of translations in time to probe the time uncertainty of a state .",
    "for example , @xmath93 represents the state @xmath94 translated in time by @xmath95 .",
    "if the overlap @xmath96 is negligible for all values of @xmath95 except for @xmath97 then @xmath94 can be regarded as sharply defined in time , at least for the purposes needed here . a more rigorous definition of such states is given by moyer s timeline states @xcite .",
    "the ambiguity mentioned at the end of the previous section also occurs here regarding the choice of the state @xmath91 , and can be treated in a similar way .",
    "we will return to this point in section [ sec : emergence][sec : conventional qm ] .",
    "the violation of t symmetry is expressed by @xmath98 which implies that there are two versions of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we label the two versions as @xmath99 and @xmath100 . in this construction ,",

    "this leaves their respective inverses @xmath109 and @xmath112 to be associated with the _ mathematical operations of rewinding _ that physical evolution . in short , physical time evolution is described by the former pair of operators , and not the latter .",
    "in fact , these associated meanings follow from conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , let @xmath113 represent the state of an arbitrary closed system at time @xmath3 .",
    "unitary evolution implies that @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the state at @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the corresponding hamiltonian .",

    "the fact that eq .",

    "it is useful at this point to divide the galaxy into two non - interacting subsystems , one whose hamiltonian @xmath261 is t - invariant and the remainder whose hamiltonian @xmath262 is t - violating ; in that case we can write @xmath263 where the superscripts `` i '' and `` v ''",
    "label operators associated with the state space of the t - invariant and t - violating hamiltonians , respectively , and @xmath264 is an appropriate identity operator . equation eq .",

    "these results are important because they not only show how the conventional formalism of quantum mechanics is recovered , but they also show how the construction introduced here may be verified experimentally . to see this consider the following three points .",
    "first , eq .",
    "shows that the t - invariant subsystem behaves in accord with the conventional hamiltonian @xmath274 with respect to clock time @xmath47 .",
    "this means that conventional quantum mechanics is recovered for this subsystem .",
    "second , eq",
    ".   shows that , due to the coarse graining , the role of the clock time @xmath47 has been reduced from being a physical variable that describes the location and uncertainty of the galaxy with respect to time as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : interference function ] , to being simply a parameter that labels a different state in the set @xmath211 according to the time @xmath275 of the maximum in @xmath276 .",
    "indeed , its demoted role is the very reason we are able to recover schrdinger s equation .",
    "third , any experiments involving t - violating matter that are performed by observers in the galaxy would give results that are consistent with eq .",
    "and so they would provide evidence of the phenomenological hamiltonian @xmath270 in the same way that experiments in our universe give evidence of the hamiltonian associated with meson decay . any demonstration that @xmath270 differs from the more elemental hamiltonians @xmath272 and @xmath273 represents a `` smoking gun '' for the construction introduced here . of course , this specific result can not be used in practice because it applies to the simple model of t violation chosen here for its clarity rather than accuracy , and also because the present knowledge of t violating hamiltonians is based on empirical results and so it is limited to the phenomenological version of the hamiltonians .",
    "more realistic models of the universe and t violating mechanisms may provide experimentally testable predictions , such as novel deviations from exponential decay for t violating matter or local variations in clock time .",
    "but these are beyond the scope of the present work whose aim is to show , in the clearest way possible , how t violation may underlie differences between time and space .",
    "we began by drawing attention to the asymmetry between time and space in conventional quantum theory where states are presumed to undergo continuous translation over time whereas there is no corresponding presumption about the state necessarily undergoing translations over space .",
    "we set out to explore an alternate possibility by introducing a new quantum formalism that gives both space and time analogous quantum descriptions . in developing the formalism",
    ", we paid particular attention to subtle mathematical details that play no significant role in conventional quantum mechanics . these details involve explicitly taking into account the p and t symmetry operations , translations of states in space and time , and fundamental limits of precision .",
    "we incorporated them in a mathematical construction where quantum states are represented as a superposition of random paths in space or time .",
    "we found that with no p or t symmetry violations , quantum states had analogous representations in space and time : just as matter can be represented as existing only in a finite region of space , it can also be represented as existing only for a finite interval of time .",
    "clearly the price we pay for this symmetry is absence of the conservation of mass . however with the violation of t symmetry ,",
    "dramatic differences between the representation of quantum states in space and time arise through the quantum interference between different paths .",
    "the state ( and the matter it describes ) is found to persist over an unbounded range of time values .",
    "this result gives a new appreciation of conservation laws : while they may be due to deep principles they are not manifested unless the state persists over a sufficient period of time .",
    "the schrdinger equation of conventional quantum mechanics , where time is reduced to a classical parameter , also emerges as a result of coarse graining over time . as such , t violation is seen in the new formalism as being responsible for fundamental differences between space and time in conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "the new formalism may also help resolve other perplexing issues associated with space and time .",
    "for example , the arrows of time indicate a preferred direction from `` past '' to `` future '' @xcite , but there is no analogous preferred direction of space . the new formalism appears to offer a basis for understanding why .",
    "indeed the set of states in time , @xmath211 for @xmath162 in eq .  , has a natural order over time in the following sense .",
    "first recall that our interpretation of eq .",
    "is that @xmath108 and @xmath111 are associated with physical evolution in different directions of time , whereas the inverses @xmath109 and @xmath112 are associated with the mathematical operations of rewinding that physical evolution . within this context , the coarse - grained state @xmath257 in eq .",
    "is interpreted as resulting from evolution by @xmath277 in the positive direction of time and @xmath278 in the reverse direction , giving a net evolution of @xmath279 in time from the state @xmath91 . correspondingly , the state @xmath280 with @xmath281 represents a _ more - evolved state _ than @xmath257 .",
    "in fact writing @xmath282 { |{\\widetilde\\upsilon(t_{\\rm c})}\\rangle}\\ ] ] where @xmath283 shows that @xmath280 evolves from @xmath257 .",
    "one might be tempted to argue that we could equally well regard @xmath257 as evolving from @xmath280 because @xmath284{|{\\widetilde\\upsilon(t'_{\\rm c})}\\rangle}\\ , \\ ] ] but doing so would be inconsistent with our interpretation of eq .  . according to that interpretation , eq .",
    "represents the mathematical _ rewinding _ of the physical evolution represented by eq .  .",
    "note that the state @xmath257 is a coarsed - grained version of the component @xmath196 of @xmath188 in eq .",
    "; an analogous argument also applies to the coarse - grained version of the other component @xmath197 , and thus to the whole state @xmath188 .",
    "hence , the set of states @xmath211 for @xmath162 are ordered by the degree of time evolution from the state @xmath91 .",
    "this gives two preferred directions of time away from the origin of the time axis and so represents a _ symmetric arrow of time_. time - symmetric arrows have also been explored by carroll , barbour and co - workers @xcite .",
    "in stark contrast , there is no analogous ordering for @xmath61 in eq .  , the set of states distributed over space .",
    "indeed , all the states in @xmath61 are physically indistinguishable .",
    "also the ordering of the set @xmath211 vanishes at @xmath285 which corresponds to t symmetry .",
    "it appears , therefore , that t violation is also responsible giving time a direction ( in the sense of orientating time away from the occurrence of @xmath91 ) .",
    "in addition to these conceptual results , the new formalism was also found to have potential experimentally - testable consequences . indeed , for a subsystem associated with t violation",

    ", will be different to the hamiltonians , @xmath272 or @xmath273 in eq .",
    ", associated with conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "further work is needed to develop feasible experiments for testing predicted departures from conventional theory like this .",

    "the importance of feynman s sums over paths for describing quantum phenomena is well beyond doubt @xcite .",
    "a distinctive feature of the quantum virtual paths in the new formalism is that they explicitly take into account the violation of t symmetry .",
    "the new formalism has the advantage of giving _ time and space an equal footing at a fundamental level _ while allowing familiar differences , such as matter being localised in space but undergoing unbounded evolution in time , to arise _ phenomenologically _ due to the fact that t violation is a property of translations in time and not space .",

    "it follows that we can use the approximations @xmath304 , @xmath305 , @xmath306 and @xmath307 to first order in @xmath292 in eq .  , and so @xmath308}{\\sin[(r+n_\\pm)z/2 ] }       \\approx(-1)^k\\prod_{r=1}^{k } \\frac{1+b\\tan(a)}{1-c\\tan(a)}\\ .\\ ] ] as @xmath309 to the same order of approximation , we can further approximate this as @xmath308}{\\sin[(r+n_\\pm)z/2 ] }         \\approx(-1)^k\\prod_{r=1}^{k } \\exp\\left[\\frac{(2r-1)\\theta}{2n}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{4}\\right)\\right]\\ , \\ ] ] and then , on evaluating the product on the right side , we eventually find @xmath308}{\\sin[(r+n_\\pm)z/2 ] }       \\approx(-1)^k\\exp\\left[\\frac{k^2\\theta}{2n}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{4}\\right)\\right]\\ .\\ ] ] substituting into eq .   then gives @xmath310                \\exp\\left[\\frac{k^2\\theta}{2n}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{4}\\right)\\right]\\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right - most factor is a gaussian function of @xmath294 provided @xmath311 is negative . to ensure that this is the case we set @xmath191 .",

    "we have defined @xmath47 via eq .",

    "this avoids any difficulties that might arise in defining clocks that are constructed from t - violating matter in general .",
    "however , for the particular case here where @xmath318=i\\lambda$ ] there are no such difficulties and a clock constructed from both t - invariant and t - violating matter will consistently register the same clock time @xmath47 irrespective of the path , and the value of @xmath47 will be the same as for a clock that is entirely constructed from t - invariant matter . to see this ,",
    "consider the two paths represented by @xmath319 and @xmath320 where @xmath321 and @xmath322 $ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to show using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula that @xcite @xmath323\\hat b\\hat a{|{\\phi}\\rangle}\\ ] ] and so both paths result in the same state apart from a complex phase factor .",
    "if we regard the whole universe as being a device that registers clock time @xmath47 and if @xmath91 represents @xmath135 then eq .   implies that both @xmath319 and @xmath320 represent it registering the clock time @xmath202 .",
    "the clock time @xmath47 is therefore representative of the whole universe in this case .",
    "although we do not have an operator corresponding to the clock time @xmath47 , we can still estimate the uncertainty in @xmath47 for the state @xmath193 using the following heuristic argument .",
    "the sum over @xmath79 in eq .",
    "means that , in addition to any intrinsic uncertainty in the time represented by clocks due to the state @xmath91 , there is an additional contribution due to the finite width of the gaussian weighting function @xmath317 .",
    "in fact , taking into account the linear relationship between @xmath47 and @xmath79 given by @xmath202 , the variance in possible clock time values @xmath47 will be at least @xmath324 times the variance in @xmath79 .",
    "thus we can bound the uncertainty in clock time as @xmath325 where @xmath326 $ ] is the variance in @xmath79 associated with the gaussian probability distribution @xmath327 , and so using @xmath151 and @xmath328 we find @xmath329    the variance in eq .",

    ", it would be useful to have one that has a particular physical meaning .",
    "one such value corresponds to minimal uncertainties in @xmath47 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 .",
    "the first step in finding it is to use the robertson - schrdinger uncertainty relation @xcite for the hamiltonians @xmath106 and @xmath107 : @xmath332}\\rangle}|^2\\ ] ] where @xmath333 and @xmath334 is the variance in @xmath335 . as @xmath336=i\\lambda$ ] , the minimum of the right side occurs when the covariance is zero : @xmath337 thus the minimum uncertainty is given by @xmath338 with no bias towards one direction of time or the other , there is correspondingly no bias towards one version of the hamiltonian or the other and so we take the minimum uncertainty condition for the energy as @xmath339    next we need to determine the relationship between @xmath198 , @xmath340 and @xmath341 .",
    "unfortunately , there has not been any previous study of the time - energy uncertainty relation for the case of t violation where two versions of the hamiltonian operate , and it would be beyond the scope of this work to analyse it in detail here . nevertheless , we can glean some insight into the problem as follows .",
    "consider the operator defined by @xmath342 it is straightforward to show that @xmath343 and so @xmath80 is t invariant . we know from the discussion of eq .   that the state @xmath344{|{\\phi}\\rangle}$ ] represents the time @xmath345 .",
    "rearranging using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula @xcite shows that @xmath346\\exp[i\\hat h 2 t_2]{|{\\phi}\\rangle}$ ] and so it follows that the state @xmath347{|{\\phi}\\rangle}$ ] represents the time @xmath348 .",
    "thus @xmath80 is clearly a generator of translations in time .",
    "a similar argument shows that the operator @xmath349 does not generate translations in time .",
    "this implies that there is a meaningful uncertainty relation for the clock time @xmath47 and @xmath80 .",

    ".   holds , then so does eq .",
    "and we find @xmath351 it is easy to calculate the product of variances in @xmath47 and @xmath80 for a state like eq .  .",
    "in the limit @xmath48 the sum over @xmath179 in eq .",
    "becomes an integral over @xmath352 and so @xmath353 which is the temporal analogy of eq .  .",
    "replacing @xmath354 with @xmath355 and performing the integral in eq .   in the eigenbasis of @xmath80 yields @xmath356{|{\\phi}\\rangle}\\ .\\ ] ] the state @xmath91 is assumed to have a large variance in energy ; in the limit that @xmath91 is a uniform superposition of the eigenstates of @xmath80 , the probability distribution for @xmath80 for the state on the right side becomes a truncated gaussian @xcite with a variance of @xmath357 .",
    "hence an approximate energy - time uncertainty relation for this particular class of states is @xmath358 we will presume that this result also applies to the states @xmath193 in eq .   without significant modification . in that case using eq .   to replace @xmath359 gives @xmath360 this gives the least uncertainty in clock time for the case where the uncertainty in energy is minimized",
    "; to be clear , the uncertainty in @xmath198 can be smaller than that given by eq .",
    "provided the uncertainty in energy is higher than the minimum represented by the equality in eq .  .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "and eq .   and keeping in mind that @xmath191 shows that the minimum uncertainty in energy and time is given by @xmath361 , i.e. for @xmath362 .",
    "note that the uncertainty @xmath198 is for each of the components @xmath193 and not for the whole state @xmath188 in eq .  .",
    "this uncertainty is appropriate from the point of view of an observer within the galaxy for whom the states @xmath193 equally describe the state of the universe up to the symmetry given by @xmath208 .",
    "the minimum representative clock time @xmath215 for the set @xmath228 defined in eq .   and the uncertainty in the clock time @xmath198 defined in eq .",
    "are important physical parameters . to estimate their values we need to quantify the minimum physically resolvable time given by @xmath88 and the degree of t violation represented by the value of @xmath85 .",
    "the planck time , @xmath363  s , is widely used as the minimum resolvable time and so we will adopt it here and set @xmath364 .    quantifying @xmath85 is a rather more difficult .",
    "one possibility is to assume that it has of the same order of magnitude as that of meson decay in our universe .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum of the ( hermitian ) commutator @xmath365 $ ] for meson decay has been estimated to have a gausian distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of @xmath366 where @xmath367 is the fraction of the estimated @xmath368 particles in the visible universe that contribute to kaon - like t violation @xcite .",
    "the standard deviation serves as a physically - meaningful value of @xmath85 and so we set @xmath369 . using eq .   with these values of @xmath85 and @xmath88",
    "then gives the minimum representative clock time as @xmath370 thus eq .   and eq .   describe the coarse - grained time evolution of the model universe from this time onwards .",
    "the corresponding value of the uncertainty in the clock time @xmath198 is , from eq .  , @xmath371    another way to quantify @xmath85 is to treat it as if its value is chosen by nature in order that the minimum representative clock time is equal to the minimum time resolution , i.e. to make @xmath372 . in that case",
    "we find , using eq .",
    ", that @xmath373 which becomes @xmath374 for @xmath364 . then using eq .",
    "we find the corresponding uncertainty in the clock time is @xmath375 this represents the most extreme situation where eq .",
    "and eq .   describe the coarse - grained time evolution for all times from @xmath135 and the uncertainty in clock time is undetectable .",
    "finally , we should add that any non - zero value of @xmath85 will give rise to the qualitative behaviour described in the main text .",
    "however , according to eq .",
    ", as the value of @xmath85 approaches zero , the minimum representative clock time @xmath215 becomes correspondingly large and so the desired behaviour is confined to ever larger times @xmath187 ."
