    "application of the author s 5-dimensional projective unified field theory ( puft ) , being published in a series of papers ( schmutzer 1995a , 1995b , 1999 , 2000a , 2001 ) , to a closed homogeneous isotropic cosmological model for the whole time scale ( big start to presence ) led to following numerical results ( schmutzer 2000b , 2000c ) , where the index @xmath0 means present and y year : @xmath1    empirical astrophysical estimates of the visible mass density of the normal ( mostly baryonic ) matter come to the maximum value @xmath2 .",
    "we interpreted our result with respect to this difference in the mass densities as a hint at the existence of a dominating dark matter part with a mass density more than two orders of magnitude greater than that of the normal matter .",
    "our hypothetical model of the cosmos investigated , roughly corresponds to the following picture of the present cosmos : + our cosmos consists of a gas of dark matter particles ( dm - particles ) penetrating all matter of the cosmos , particularly also the existing compact objects ( stars , nuclei of galaxies etc . ) which look like buoys in the dark matter sea . assuming a homogeneous gas of one sort of particles , by some hypothetical arguments we recently were led to the following numerical values ( schmutzer 2000b ) : @xmath3    as a result of the attractive interaction of the dm - particles with the compact object considered we expect a statistical distribution of the dm - particles within and around the compact object being embedded in this dm - gas .",
    "let us introduce the notion `` accretion cloud ''",
    "( umwolke ) for this part of the dm - gas which by accretion exceeds the cosmological average distribution of the dm - gas . for simplicity we model the compact object by a homogeneous mass sphere .",
    "further for simplicity we apply the boltzmann - maxwell statistics describing spinless particles without degeneracy .",
    "let us here mention that in a different context and on a different theoretical basis h. dehnen et al .",
    "( dehnen 1995 ) used the bose - einstein statistics ( preferred by physical arguments ) and the fermi - dirac statistics ( dropped ) in treating the dark matter in galaxies in order to find a theoretical concept in understanding the problem of the `` flat rotation curves '' of stars in galaxies .",
    "in interesting papers detailled quantum - statistical calculations were performed .",
    "we think that for a rough understanding of our approach it is legitimate to simplify the situation by referring to the boltzmann - maxwell statistics .",
    "in the following puft is specialized to the nonrelativistic and weak field case , but we take into account the scalaric effects described by the scalaric field function @xmath4 . then the gravitational field equation is given by @xmath5 ( @xmath6 local newtonian gravitational field of the central body , @xmath7 mass density of the central body , @xmath8 newtonian gravitational constant as a true constant ) .",
    "the scalaric field may consist of two parts according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the global scalaric cosmological field and @xmath11 the local scalaric field of the central body .",
    "then the scalaric field equation reads @xmath12 in the general case of a test body moving in the external fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 as well as in eventually existing external electromagnetic fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( neglecting in all fields the back reaction ) the equation of motion reads : @xmath17 ( @xmath18 inertial mass , @xmath19 electric charge , @xmath20 velocity of the test body ) .",
    "let us mention that the last term on the left hand side of this equation of motion leads to `` bremsheat production '' , particularly also in celestial bodies , investigated in detail in previous papers ( schmutzer 2000c , schmutzer 2001 ) .    in the following we refer to a test body without electric charge , i.e. @xmath21 because of the same mathematical structure of both the equations ( [ s3 ] ) and ( [ s5 ] ) , in this approximation it is possible to introduce the combined field function @xmath22 ( @xmath23 cosmological value of the newtonian potential ) .",
    "hence we obtain the common field equation @xmath24 and the equation of motion @xmath25 let us now use following notation : @xmath26 ( @xmath27 mass density of normal matter , @xmath28 mass density of dark matter ) .",
    "application of this latter formula to the interior ( @xmath29 ) and to the exterior ( @xmath30 ) of the spherical central body leads to the equations @xmath31 next we split the mass densities into both the parts coming from the global cosmological matter ( normal matter and md - matter ) and from the local matter ( central body and accretion cloud ) : @xmath32 and @xmath33 here the indices refer to : @xmath34 the roof denotes the dm- contribution induced by the central body , i.e. surplus dark matter to be treated statistically .    for our further calculations it is convenient to introduce the abbreviations",
    "@xmath35 let us remind that our cosmological model led us to following numerical values of the scalaric cosmological world function : @xmath36 then the field equation ( [ s8 ] ) for the interior and exterior reads : @xmath37 further from ( [ s7 ] ) results @xmath38 next , analogously to the above formulas for the mass density of the dm - particles we now write down the corresponding formulas for the particle number density @xmath39 being related to the mass density as follows @xmath40 mass of a dm - particle ) : @xmath41 we find @xmath42 in ( [ s18 ] ) and ( [ s19 ] ) we omitted the idices @xmath29 and @xmath43    since the time dependence of the cosmological quantities ( e.g. of @xmath44 ) is extremly slow ( adiabatic time dependence ) , compared with the time dependence of the cosmogonic processes of the cosmic objects , we omit explicit writing of the time @xmath45 in such cosmological quantities . particularly constants of spatial integration implicitly involve this adiabatic time dependence .",
    "according to our accretion concept presented in section [ sec1 ] the statistical dm - particle number density for the case of spherical symmetry reads ( k boltzmann constant ) : @xmath46\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 denotes the dm - particle number density far away from the cental body : @xmath48 the potental function @xmath49 used is related to @xmath50 by @xmath51 using ( [ s20 ] ) we can write the equations ( [ s16 ] ) as @xmath52\\ , , \\\\ { \\displaystyle}{\\mbox{b)}\\quad } \\delta \\chi _ { e}&=&4\\pi \\gamma _ { n } \\left[\\mu _ { g}+m\\bar{n}\\left\\{\\exp ( -\\frac{m\\chi _ { e}}{\\text{k}t})-1\\right\\}\\right]\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath53 ( referring to a homogeneous sphere ) means the mass density of the sphere .",
    "let us for the following use the approximation assumption @xmath54 being well fulfilled in our further applications .",
    "hence series expansion of ( [ s20 ] ) leads to the linearity @xmath55 between @xmath56 and @xmath49 .",
    "this simplification means that we are able to perform the further calculations analytically .",
    "then the equations ( [ s23 ] ) commonly treated ( omitting the indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) read @xmath57 where @xmath58 means @xmath59 for the interior or @xmath60 for the exterior , and @xmath61 is defined by @xmath62    let us here mention that the author s dissertation had referred to the theory of strong electrolytes , where according to the debye - milner theory the statistical treatment of a ( negative ) ion cloud around a fixed ( positive ) ion ( and vice versa ) plays an important role .",
    "this knowledge induced the author s idea to treat the dark matter gas analogously .",
    "but in the first moment he was surprised that , though between positive and negative electric charges as well as between masses attractive forces act , in his basic equation ( [ s27 ] ) the second term on the left hand side appeared with a positive sign , in contrast to the theory of strong electrolytes .",
    "the consequence of this fact is that in the debye - milner theory a yukawa - like term with exponential decrease occurs , whereas in this theory an interesting phenomenon of periodicity is met .    in solving the equation ( [ s27 ] )",
    "we first go over to spherical polar coordinates : @xmath63      in this case the substitution @xmath64 has to be applied",
    ". then equation ( [ s29 ] ) reads @xmath65 the solution of this inhomogenious differential equation is @xmath66 with @xmath67 is the mass of the central body with radius @xmath68 ( @xmath69and @xmath70 constants of integration ) .",
    "regularity at @xmath71 leads to @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 differentiaton gives @xmath74      this case differs from the previous one by the substitution @xmath75 .",
    "analogously we receive the solution @xmath76 with @xmath77 ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 constants of integration ) . for physical reasons",
    "this formally correct result has to be changed , because it is not in accordance with the boundary condition ( [ s21]b ) : we know that the global source @xmath60 has already be taken into account by solving the cosmological differential equations .",
    "therefore in this local context we have to drop the inhomogenious contribution by setting @xmath80 i.e. @xmath81 differentiation leads to @xmath82 in performing these calculations we realized that following basic functions play an important role : @xmath83 figures [ ufkt ] and [ vfkt ] show the plots of the functions @xmath84 and @xmath85      at the surface of the spherical central body following continuity conditions have to be fulfilled : @xmath86 if these conditions are satisfied , then because of ( [ s20 ] ) the analogous conditions for the dm - particle number densities result : @xmath87 i.e. thus the continuity of the dm - particle number density is guaranteed , too .",
    "looking at ( [ s33 ] ) and ( [ s37 ] ) we recognize that we have to cope with the 3 constants of integration @xmath70 , @xmath78 and @xmath88 from both the conditions ( 40 ) we obtain the relations @xmath89 for physical reasons it seems to be sensible to accept that the potential in the whole space ( interior and exterior ) may be determined solely by the central mass .",
    "this means setting @xmath90 .",
    "then finally the decisive potentials ( [ s33 ] ) and ( [ s37 ] ) including their derivatives ( [ s34 ] ) and ( [ s38 ] ) read : @xmath91 @xmath92 let us mention that in the center of the central body the equations @xmath93 are valid .    furthermore , according to ( [ s26 ] ) we also present with the help of ( [ s43]a ) and ( [ s44]a ) the final form of the distribution functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 : @xmath96      for various applications it is convenient to know the first terms of the series expansion of some functions presented above : @xmath97 @xmath98\\ , , \\\\",
