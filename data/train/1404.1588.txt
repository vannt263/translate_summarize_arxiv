    "complex networks constitute a powerful framework to study many real complex systems as the world wide web , social networks and brain networks  @xcite@xcite@xcite . during last years",
    ", many models to generate complex networks and to study their properties have been developed .",
    "for instance , models as the barabasi - albert model  @xcite , the erds - renyi graphs  @xcite and the watts - strogatz model  @xcite , have attracted the attention of many scientists due to their usefulness to represent and to analyze systems belonging to different fields , e.g. , biology , sociology , internet and economy . in particular , the barabasi - albert model is based on the preferential attachment mechanism and it allows to achieve scale - free networks , i.e. , networks characterized by a degree distribution ( i.e. , the distribution of the number of connections ) that follows a power - law  @xcite .",
    "the erds - renyi graphs model generates networks with a binomial degree distribution , that converges to a poissonian distribution under opportune conditions .",
    "these networks are also called classical random networks .",
    "the watts - strogatz model implements an interpolation between an erds - renyi graph and a regular ring lattice , yielding networks with a homogeneous degree distribution .",
    "other models , to study the evolution of complex networks have been inspired from theoretical physics , for example the bosonic networks  @xcite@xcite and the fermionic networks  @xcite . both kinds of models aim to represent networks as quantum gases , showing that the networks evolution can be studied in terms of phase transitions see also  @xcite . eventually , some authors studied the geometrical properties of complex networks .",
    "for instance , in the work of krioukov et al .",
    "@xcite , authors define a geometrical framework to generate networks characterized by a scale - free structure , by using a hyperbolic metrics . in this work ,",
    "we propose a method , based on random walk processes  @xcite , to generate networks provided with a gaussian degree distribution .",
    "although gaussian networks can be observed in some real systems , see for instance  @xcite@xcite , there are still not defined models to generate them . in the proposed model ,",
    "we let a random walker to generate connections among nodes during its path . in particular , at each time step , the random walker visits a node and connects it with other nodes . in so doing , the random walker can jump from node to node by using these connections , choosing the destination node by a random selection among those available ( i.e. , the nodes connected to its position ) .",
    "this dynamics can be viewed as a random walk process . in general , random walks have been widely used to analyze and to explore complex networks  @xcite@xcite@xcite , both from a classical and from a quantum  @xcite computational perspective . furthermore , in the work of saramki and kaski  @xcite , authors illustrate a mechanism , based on random walks , to generate scale - free networks .",
    "we study the proposed model by numerical simulations , showing that it is possible to generate gaussian networks and , moreover , that parameters as the clustering coefficient and the assortativity have a critical behavior .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : random - walker ] briefly discusses random walk processes on complex networks and some applications .",
    "section  [ sec : model_random_walker ] introduces the proposed model based on random walk processes .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows results of numerical simulations .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] ) ends the paper .",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce some basic concepts of random walks and we recall some applications to complex networks analysis . in general , a random walk is a path composed by a sequence of random steps .",
    "it can be developed on different @xmath0-dimensional metric spaces . probably , the most simple example of a @xmath1-dimensional random walk is the sequence of coin tosses .",
    "formally , given a set of @xmath1-dimensional random variables @xmath2 , whose values can be @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( with probability @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ) and a set @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the series @xmath10 is called random walk . if the random walker is embedded in a network space , the random variables @xmath2 are the nodes of the network  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a connected graph @xmath11 , with @xmath12 non - empty set of nodes ( or vertices ) and @xmath13 non - empty set of edges , represented by the adjacency matrix @xmath14 .",
    "elements @xmath15 , of the matrix @xmath14 , represent the edges among nodes . in the case of a binary network , @xmath16 if nodes @xmath17 and @xmath18 are connected , otherwise @xmath19 .",
    "now , let us consider a random walker in the node @xmath17 at time @xmath20 . at next step , i.e. , at time @xmath21",
    ", it can jump to one of the @xmath22 neighbors of the node @xmath17 ( with @xmath23 degree of the node @xmath17 ) .",
    "in particular , the probability that it will jump to the node @xmath18 ( at time @xmath21 ) is defined as :    @xmath24    with @xmath23 computed as @xmath25 .",
    "in general , if a random walker is in the node @xmath17 at @xmath26 , the probability @xmath27 to find it in the node @xmath18 at time @xmath20 , is given by the master equation :    @xmath28    in order to analyze the dynamics of a random walker on complex networks , it is useful to estimate the number of steps required to cover a defined path , e.g. , from a node @xmath14 to a node @xmath29 .",
    "these measures are not trivial and different strategies can be developed to compute them ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in this context we are interested in the estimation of a parameter called `` cover time ''  @xcite ( we indicated as @xmath30 ) .",
    "this parameter represents the number of steps used by the random walker to visit each node of a network . in general , the value of @xmath30 depends on the topology of the random network . for instance , in a fully - connected network the cover time is computed as : @xmath31 with @xmath32 number of nodes , whereas in erds - renyi graphs its value can be computed according to the following equation : @xmath33 with @xmath34 , representing the connectedness of the network ( i.e. , there are not nodes with @xmath35 ) .",
    "random walk processes can be used to analyze and to generate complex networks .",
    "for instance , they can be applied to community detection  @xcite as , if a network has a community structure , a random walker will spend long time inside each community because of the density of internal edges that they will be passed through . in the work  @xcite",
    ", the author shows a method to explore complex networks by using random walkers .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite authors develop a method to estimate the following properties of a network : the average clustering coefficient , the global clustering coefficient and the network size , i.e. , the number of nodes .",
    "finally , in the work  @xcite , it is shown a method to generate scale - free networks by using random walks .",
    "in particular , authors define the following algorithm :    1 .",
    "the network is initialized with @xmath36 connected nodes .",
    "the random walker is placed on a randomly chosen node .",
    "3 .   at each step , the random walker jumps to a new node among the neighbors of the current node . after @xmath37 steps the node at which the random walker has arrived is marked .",
    "the random walker covers continuously a new path until @xmath38 different nodes are marked .",
    "a new node is added to the network and connected to the @xmath39 marked nodes ; then the process is repeated from step ( @xmath40 ) until the network has @xmath32 nodes .",
    "it is worth to recall that the above algorithm implements a preferential attachment mechanism .",
    "let us now to introduce a model , based on random walks , to generate gaussian networks .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath32 nodes with an initial degree equal to zero , i.e. , there are not edges in the network . a random walker , that wants to generate connections between nodes , is added to the system and it is placed on a randomly chosen node . at each time step , the random walker draws up to @xmath39 edges between the node on which it is located and other ones randomly chosen .",
    "then , it jumps to one neighbor node , among those available from its position , selecting its destination `` @xmath17 '' by eq .",
    "[ eq : jump_probability ] :    * if the node @xmath17 is unvisited , it draws @xmath41 ( with @xmath23 degree of the node @xmath17 ) new edges between the node @xmath17 and other randomly chosen nodes . * else",
    "it draws only one new edge between the node @xmath17 and another randomly chosen node .    note",
    "that , if the node @xmath17 is unvisited and @xmath42 the random walker can not generate any new edge , therefore it can just select a new node to visit .",
    "instead , if the node @xmath17 has been already visited , the random walker draws a new edge to avoid infinite loop in the algorithm , i.e. , to avoid to be trapped in a small set of nodes with a degree @xmath43 .",
    "obviously , in both cases , connections are generated only between two nodes , e.g. , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , that are still not connected ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) . the algorithm ends when all nodes have been visited by the random walker .",
    "to summarize , the proposed method is composed by the following steps :    1 .",
    "define @xmath32 nodes and @xmath39 maximum number of new edges generated at each time step .",
    "2 .   place a random walker on the @xmath45th node ( randomly chosen ) .",
    "3 .   the random walker connects the @xmath45th node with @xmath39 ( randomly selected ) nodes .",
    "4 .   the random walker jumps to a neighbor node ( selected according to eq .",
    "[ eq : jump_probability ] ) .",
    "5 .   the random walker verifies",
    "whether its destination node `` @xmath17 '' is unvisited : a.   if `` @xmath17 '' is unvisited , the random walker connects it with @xmath41 nodes ; b.   else the random walker connects it with only one node .",
    "repeat from @xmath46 until all nodes have been visited by the random walker .",
    "figure  [ fig : random_path ] illustrates three screenshots of the pathway covered by the random walker in a small network ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) .     and @xmath48 .",
    "the blue diamond is the starting node , whereas the red diamond is the final node .",
    "the green points are visited nodes and the black crosses are unvisited nodes.,width=480 ]    although , the random walker moves among nodes following specific directions , i.e. , from the node @xmath45 to the node @xmath49 , it is possible to generate both directed and undirected networks .",
    "figure  [ fig : small_network ] shows a small networks ( @xmath50 ) generated by the proposed model .",
    "there are many differences between our model and that described in  @xcite .",
    "just to cite a few , we consider an initial set of @xmath32 unconnected nodes and a random walker that generates edges at each time step .",
    "moreover , the proposed model does not yield scale - free networks , but networks provided with a gaussian degree distribution .",
    "we performed many numerical simulations to study the proposed model . in particular",
    ", we analyzed the main properties of simulated networks , as the degree distribution , the path length , the clustering coefficient  @xcite and the assortativity  @xcite .",
    "simulations have been performed with a number of nodes @xmath32 in the range @xmath51 $ ] and values of @xmath39 in the range @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "the first analysis is related to the studying of the degree distribution @xmath53 of simulated networks see",
    "panel  * a * of figure  [ fig : degree_distribution ] .    .",
    "* b * average degree distribution achieved varying the value of @xmath39 .",
    "each curve refers to networks of different size .",
    "the black dotted lines fit the achieved results .",
    "results are averaged over @xmath54 different realizations .",
    "* c * degree distribution ( green line ) of a network with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , fitted by a gaussian function ( black dotted line ) . * d * degree distribution ( red line ) of a network with @xmath57 and @xmath56 , fitted by a gaussian function ( black dotted line).,width=480 ]    in general , we found that for small values of @xmath39 networks are characterized by the presence of a few hubs , since as @xmath39 increases the right tail of the @xmath53 reduces ( considering networks with the same size ) . in the proposed model ,",
    "the analytical definition of the average degree @xmath58 is not trivial .",
    "notwithstanding , by considering the dynamics of the random walker , we derive the following equation : @xmath59 with @xmath60 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : cover_time ] .",
    "in particular , the degree of each node is equal to the sum of @xmath39 with the amount of further visits , as at least a new link is generated each time . to estimate the number of further visits to each node , we consider the structure of a growing classical random network ( by using @xmath60 ) .",
    "values of @xmath58 , achieved in simulated networks , allow to compute the parameter @xmath61 . in panel",
    "* b * of figure  [ fig : degree_distribution ] it is possible to compare the results achieved in simulated networks with the theoretical values computed by eq .",
    "[ eq : average_degree ] .",
    "finally , as shown in panels  * c - d * of figure  [ fig : degree_distribution ] , we found that gaussian functions allow to fit the achieved degree distributions .",
    "therefore , we call these networks `` gaussian networks '' .      the analysis of the path length allows to evaluate whether simulated networks show a small - world behavior .",
    "the latter implies that the distance between two randomly chosen nodes , called also average shortest path lenght ( or @xmath62 ) , grows proportionally to the logarithm of the network size , i.e. , @xmath63 see  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : path_length ] , we show results achieved during numerical simulations .     and @xmath55 , varying the value of @xmath39 .",
    "results are averaged over @xmath54 different realizations.,width=432 ]    as expected , the @xmath62 depends on the network size @xmath32 and , moreover , it decreases as the value of @xmath39 increases . in particular , as the number of edges ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) , generated at each time step , increases the average shortest distance decreases , since more paths are available .",
    "it is interesting to note that values of @xmath62 do not scale logarithmically with the network size ( i.e. , with @xmath64 ) , but they scale with @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , networks generated by the proposed model can be defined as `` ultrasmall '' see  @xcite .",
    "now , we consider the clustering coefficient @xmath66 computed in networks simulated varying both @xmath32 and @xmath39 . in general , the clustering coefficient allows to know if nodes of a network tend to cluster together , therefore this measure supplies a further information on the network structure . at the beginning",
    ", we consider the average value of @xmath66 as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "related results are shown in the panel  * a * of figure  [ fig : clustering ] .",
    "it is interesting to note a strange behavior of the considered parameter @xmath67 for low values of @xmath39 . in particular , starting from @xmath68 and increasing up to @xmath69 , the value of @xmath67 decreases .",
    "then , as @xmath39 increases from @xmath70 to the @xmath71 , @xmath67 linearly increases .",
    "we also analyze the variation of the clustering coefficient with the node degree ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) see panels  * b - c - d * of figure  [ fig : clustering ] .    .",
    "* b * clustering coefficient in function of the node degree in networks with @xmath73 .",
    "* c * clustering coefficient in function of the node degree in networks with @xmath74 . * d * clustering coefficient in function of the node degree in networks with @xmath75 .",
    "results are averaged over @xmath54 different realizations.,width=480 ]    results of this analysis show that the clustering coefficient is higher for nodes with a small degrees than for those with a big degree .",
    "furthermore , this parameter has a steady - state behavior until a ( relatively ) high @xmath76 , where we observe a breaking point of such behavior , followed by a fast exponential decrease of @xmath66 as @xmath77 .",
    "eventually , we analyze the assortativity of simulated networks .",
    "the assortativity is a property that allows to evaluate if nodes prefer to attach to other nodes that are ( not ) similar .",
    "this property affects the whole structure of a network .",
    "for instance , social networks can be divided into communities of users speaking the same language or having same hobbies .",
    "a network is assortative when its assortativity @xmath78 is positive and , on the contrary , it is disassortative when @xmath78 is negative .",
    "the similarity between nodes can refers to their degree . in this case , johnson et al .",
    "@xcite found a relation between the assortativity and the shannon entropy of networks .",
    "in particular , they demonstrated that scale - free networks have a high probability to be disassortative .",
    "results of this analysis illustrate that the assortativity strongly depends on @xmath39 see figure  [ fig : assortativity ] .",
    "different realizations.,width=432 ]    although all simulated networks are disassortative ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) , it is worth to observe that @xmath78 increases almost up to @xmath80 as @xmath39 increases from @xmath68 to @xmath81 , then this value slowly decreases as @xmath39 increases .",
    "moreover , this behavior appears in networks of different size , i.e. , it does not depend on @xmath32 .",
    "in this work , we propose a model to generate complex networks by using a random walker . as reported in previous works , random walks can be used to analyze complex networks , e.g. , performing community detection or exploration tasks and also to generate scale - free networks  @xcite .",
    "we implement a random walker that plays the role of `` edges - generator '' .",
    "as shown by numerical simulations , the cited model allows to achieve networks characterized by a gaussian degree distribution .",
    "networks provided with this distribution can be observed in some real systems , as described in  @xcite@xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , there are not models for generating networks provided with this kind of degree distribution .",
    "simulated networks allow to measure important parameters as the average shortest path length , the clustering coefficient and the assortativity .",
    "the analysis of the path lenght shows that these networks are `` ultrasmall '' ( see  @xcite ) , as their average shortest path length scales as @xmath82 .",
    "the clustering coefficient and the assortativity have a critical behavior in networks generated with small values of @xmath39 . in particular , the average value of the former has an initial decrease as @xmath39 increases from @xmath68 to @xmath83 .",
    "after this value , the average @xmath66 linearly increases with @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , we observe a fast transition from ( relatively ) high values of @xmath66 ( as a function of the node degree @xmath76 ) to ( relatively ) low values , by using @xmath84 .",
    "in particular , the function @xmath72 has a steady - state behavior until @xmath76 reaches a critical ( relatively ) high value .",
    "on the other hand , the assortavity @xmath78 of simulated networks is always negative , i.e. , they are disassortative . as before ,",
    "it is worth to observe a difference , in the behavior of the proposed model , between results achieved with small @xmath39 and those achieved with big @xmath39 . in particular , as @xmath39 increases from @xmath68 to @xmath85 , the value of @xmath78 increases",
    ". then , @xmath78 slowly decreases as @xmath39 further increases .",
    "we deem that the critical behavior of the proposed model strictly depends on the rule followed by the random walker to generate the edges . for small values of @xmath39",
    "the random walker spends more time to generate all the necessary edges , whereas for high values of @xmath39 in a few time steps many nodes are immediately connected .",
    "furthermore , the rule that allows the random walker to generate one more edge , in the event it visits an already visited node , is responsible for the formation of hubs ( i.e. , nodes provided with a high degree ) .",
    "eventually , the proposed model represents a new approach to generate random networks , provided with well defined features as the gaussian degree distribution , the `` ultrasmall '' behavior , and the negative assortativity . in particular , it is worth to note that the `` ultrasmall '' behavior has been observed in scale - free networks , that are much different from those illustrated in this work .",
    "therefore , we deem the proposed model useful to study networks characterized by the described parameters , since these ones can be found in real networks and they can also be observed in different networks provided with more popular structures ( e.g. , scale - free ) .",
