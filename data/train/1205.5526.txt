    "in the search for new classes of multifunctional materials , the design or discovery of ferroelectrics in which the spontaneous electrical polarization couples strongly to other structural , magnetic , orbital , and electronic degrees of freedom is a challenge being actively pursued as a means to achieve electric field - controllable emergent phenomena such as ferromagnetism  @xcite .",
    "much of the current materials - by - design effort has focused on the structurally and chemically complex abo@xmath2 perovskites , a large class of functional materials that display a wide range of properties due to their highly tunable ground states . because of the high susceptibility of perovskite materials towards polar structural instabilities , a notion has emerged that it is generally more productive to start with a material that displays , for example , ferromagnetism , and devise a way to induce ferroelectricity .",
    "two highly successful approaches that have captivated the attention of researchers over the last decade are that of epitaxial strain engineering ( strain - induced ferroelectricity , mutliferroicity ) and that of selective chemical substitution of a stereochemically inactive cation with a lone - pair - active cation such as bi@xmath3 , as in bifeo@xmath2  @xcite . while highly successful at creating new multiferroics ( materials that are both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric ) , generally speaking these approaches have not led to a widespread solution to the central problem of _ strong coupling _ between the polarization and the magnetism .",
    "the reason is believed to be due to the common nature of the ferroelectricity in these materials ( small cation displacements such as those in the prototypical perovskite ferroelectric batio@xmath2 ) .",
    "new ideas to realize ferroelectricity are clearly needed .",
    "a@xmath4c@xmath5 ) of the abo@xmath2 constituents , ( b ) the ferroelectric ( a / a@xmath6)b@xmath7o@xmath1 structure with the same a@xmath4a@xmath4c@xmath5 rotation pattern , ( c ) the a@xmath4a@xmath4c@xmath8 and ( d ) the a@xmath8a@xmath8c@xmath5 rotation patterns that make up _ pnma_. ( e ) first principles calculated octahedral rotations of a suite of materials that span a wide range of tolerance factor.,width=340 ]    although perovskites are often what comes to mind when discussing oxide ferroelectricity , the overwhelming majority of oxide perovskites  particularly those which have active electronic , magnetic , and orbital degrees of freedom  adopt highly distorted , non - polar , ground state structures in which the bo@xmath1 octahedra are rotated about one or more of the crystal axes  @xcite . a fascinating question",
    "that has only recently been considered in earnest , starting with the work of ref .",
    ", concerns how to directly control these octahedral rotations with an external electric field . since rotations of the bo@xmath1 octahedra couple strongly to other properties  @xcite , magnetism  @xcite for example ,",
    "gaining control over them could solve the strong coupling problem  @xcite .",
    "another way of stating the challenge is , `` how can octahedral rotations induce a spontaneous polarization ? ''    by themselves octahedral rotations can not induce ferroelectricity in simple perovskites , but recent work has demonstrated that they can induce ferroelectricity in layered a - site ordered double perovskites and superlatties  @xcite and in ruddlesden - popper phases  @xcite ( and other layered perovskites  @xcite ) .",
    "the most common realization of this novel rotation - centric , ferroelectric mechanism has been referred to as hybrid improper ferroelectricity ( hif )  @xcite . the defining feature of hif is a symmetry - allowed trilinear coupling in the free energy , @xmath9 where @xmath0 is the amplitude of the polarization , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the amplitudes of non - polar , symmetry inequivalent octahedral rotation modes  @xcite , and @xmath12 is the coupling coefficient .",
    "the presence of this invariant in the free energy implies that when @xmath10 and @xmath11 become non - zero , a polarization will be induced in the ground state structure , even in the absence of prototypical , batio@xmath2-like , polar ( zone - center ) instabilities .",
    "using a combination of first - principles electronic structure methods and symmetry arguments , rondinelli and fennie recently established design rules for the creation of hybrid improper ferroelectrics in abo@xmath2/a@xmath13bo@xmath2 superlattices  @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned superlattices correspond to ( a / a@xmath13)b@xmath7o@xmath1 double perovskites in which the a and a@xmath13 sites order into alternating layers along [ 001 ] ( note we will use these two different views of the structure interchangeably ) .",
    "these rules can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the chemical criterion states that abo@xmath2/a@xmath13bo@xmath2 superlattices allows for a trilinear invariant , @xmath14 , in the free energy by symmetry , and ( 2 ) the energetic criterion states that at least one of the perovskite constituents of the superlattice should have a strong tendency towards the @xmath15 perovskite structure ( that is , @xmath15 should be the ground state structure , preferably , or a metastable phase with a wide stability window ) .",
    "the majority of perovskites form in the _ pnma _ space group  @xcite and therefore the rules of rondinelli and fennie are widely accessible to many chemistries and have the potential to lead to new classes of multifunctional materials .",
    "note that the symmetry of the _ pnma _ structure is established by two symmetry - inequivalent octahedral rotations , which in glazer notation are : a@xmath4a@xmath4c@xmath8 ( with amplitude @xmath16 because this rotation pattern transforms like the irreducible representation ( irrep ) @xmath17 of @xmath18 ) and a@xmath8a@xmath8c@xmath5 ( with amplitude @xmath19 , which transforms like @xmath20 ) , shown in figures  [ fig1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) respectively .",
    "the energetic criterion ensures that the combined rotation pattern a@xmath4a@xmath4c@xmath5 survives in the ordered double perovskite .",
    "these design rules establish when such a hybrid improper state should exist . the microscopic mechanism responsible for the polarization , however , is still unknown and hence the design rules do not directly address the question of whether or not this hybrid improper state is a functional ferroelectric or simply a pyroelectric . without insight from the microscopics ,",
    "a fundamental materials problem that prevents widespread realization of these new multifunctional materials remains  that of understanding how to design a material with a large spontaneous polarization and a low ferroelectric switching barrier .",
    "this problem is best described by considering :    * * conjecture 1 . *",
    "given the form of the trilinear coupling term , eq .",
    "[ tri ] , it is reasonable to assume that the spontaneous polarization @xmath0 will increase as the strength of each rotation , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , increases .",
    "that is , as the energetic criterion becomes increasingly satisfied . indeed , to lowest order the polarization can be shown to be proportional to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the polar mode stiffness renormalized by rotations and other structural distortions",
    "( see appendix for details ) . * * corollary 1 . *",
    "if this assumption is true there is a problem , in that large rotations necessarily lead to a large ferroelectric switching barrier ( barring pathologically flat energy surfaces ) , since in order to switch @xmath0 from say up to down , you must switch the sense of one of the bo@xmath1 octahedral rotations .",
    "are these two points really true , and if so , is there a way around them in order to realize a high @xmath0 , low switching barrier rotation - driven ferroelectric ?     +      one way to control the magnitude of octahedral rotations in perovskites is by chemical substitution of a or b - site cations with different ionic radii , @xmath23 and/or @xmath24 .",
    "this effectively allows one to control the tolerance factor , @xmath25 a geometric descriptor that correlates with the stability of a particular abo@xmath2 material towards octahedral rotations  @xcite . in general , as @xmath26 decreases , the greater the susceptibility of a material towards octahedral rotations .",
    "we consider three families of perovskites and within each family we consider a = mg , ca , sr , and ba , which as shown in figure  [ fig1](e ) , span a wide range of tolerance factors and therefore have a wide favorability towards @xmath15 .",
    "all exist in nature in the perovskite structure except mgzro@xmath2 and mgsno@xmath2 .",
    "in figure  [ tolvs](a ) we plot a measure of the expected magnitude of the a@xmath4a@xmath4c@xmath5 rotation pattern in the a / a@xmath27 double perovskites versus average tolerance factor , @xmath28 ( defined as the average tolerance factor of abo@xmath2 and a@xmath13bo@xmath2 ) .",
    "this measure , based on the properties of the @xmath15 perovskites , is the geometric mean of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where both quantities are defined as , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the amplitudes of @xmath20 in @xmath15 abo@xmath2 and a@xmath13bo@xmath2 respectively .",
    "a nearly linear behavior can be seen , and as expected , the smaller the average tolerance factor , the larger the magnitude of the rotations .",
    "@xcite    in figure  [ tolvs](b ) we plot the energy difference , @xmath34e@xmath35 , between the lowest energy paraelectric state ( the fully relaxed a@xmath4a@xmath4c@xmath8 structure in space group @xmath36 ) , and the polar state in the actual abo@xmath2/a@xmath27bo@xmath2 system . by using this paraelectric state as a reference structure",
    "this not only gives us an idea as to the ` stability ' of the hybrid improper ground state but also the intrinsic energetic barrier to switch the polarization  via switching the @xmath37 rotation  between ferroelectric domains . across our entire test suite of materials of sixteen different superlattices ( sls )",
    ", we find that the stability of the hybrid improper state smoothly increases as the average tolerance factor decreases , consistent with the energetic criterion of rondinelli and fennie , which subsequently implies that the intrinsic barrier to switch the polarization also increases .",
    "therefore , in order to have a ferroelectric that is switchable in an experimentally realizable electric field the average tolerance factor of the perovskite constituents making up the superlattice will need to be large . _ does this mean that the spontaneous polarization will necessarily be small , as alluded to by corollary 1 ? _",
    "we now consider how the induced polarization varies with @xmath28 . in figure  [ tolvs](c )",
    "we plot the calculated polarization of the various superlattices versus average tolerance factor where it is seen that no obvious trend exists across all sixteen sls .",
    "in fact , it appears to be maximal near @xmath380.98 .",
    "the lack of a clear correlation between @xmath0 and the magnitude of the rotations is in stark contrast to the expectation based on the trilinear coupling picture .",
    "indeed from equation  [ ptri ] and our first - principle results , which indicate that @xmath39 as shown in figure  [ tolvs](a ) and that @xmath40 is largely independent of tolerance factor ( as expected for the renormalized value in @xmath15 as shown in fig .",
    "s[supp_polarmode ] ) , the trilinear coupling picture would predict @xmath41 where the renormalized force constant of the polarization , @xmath22 , is independent of @xmath26 .",
    "is essentially the average polar force constant of abo@xmath2 and a@xmath27bo@xmath2 in the pnma structure and that @xmath22 in each pnma compound is independent of @xmath26 .",
    "see appendix figure  [ supp_polarmode ] . ]",
    "figure  [ tolvs](c ) , however , makes clear that there is not this ( or any ) simple , universal , chemistry - independent correlation between the polarization and the magnitude of the rotations : @xmath42 what went wrong , if anything , in this argument ?",
    "perhaps the expected magnitude of the rotations in the superlattices is not approximated well by the averages ?",
    "while this may in fact lead to a small discrepancy , it is unlikely that this is the origin of the qualitative disagreement between the expected polarization within the trilinear coupling picture and one s own chemical and physical intuition . instead , the key is to realize that the coupling coefficient , @xmath12 , can have a nontrivial , non - monotonic dependence on the particular abo@xmath2 materials making up the superlattice . in order to regain an intuitive and predictive relationship between the polarization and simple chemical descriptors such as a tolerance factor , however , the microscopic origin of the coupling constant needs to be addressed .",
    "does @xmath12 really depend on the specific material constituents of the superlattice or can it be described by a universal functional form that is independent of chemistry ?    to address this question , let us first look more closely at the polarization within a specific family of compounds , the germanate , ageo@xmath2/a@xmath27geo@xmath2 sls .",
    "as shown in figure  [ tolvs](c ) , the polarization initially increases as @xmath26 decreases , but then remains fairly constant as @xmath28 is further reduced , but then increases substantially before steadily decreasing as average tolerance factor is still further reduced . as already concluded , this is not the @xmath28 dependence expected from equations  [ ptrinot ] and  [ pnot ] .",
    "if , however , a similar exercise is performed but this time keeping the chemistry of one of the a - sites fixed , a pattern begins to emerge .",
    "this is best seen by considering two cases .",
    "first , consider the ageo@xmath2/bageo@xmath2 sls as the average tolerance factor decreases :    * srgeo@xmath2/bageo@xmath2 , @xmath28 = 1.07 , p=0@xmath43c/@xmath44 + @xmath45 + cageo@xmath2/bageo@xmath2 , @xmath28 = 1.04 , p=4@xmath43c/@xmath44 + @xmath46 + mggeo@xmath2/bageo@xmath2 , @xmath28 = 0.99 , p=16@xmath43c/@xmath47    here the polarization monotonically increases , consistent with one s intuition . next consider the mggeo@xmath2/a@xmath27geo@xmath2 sls :    * mggeo@xmath2/bageo@xmath2 , @xmath28 = 0.99 , p = 16@xmath43c/@xmath44 + @xmath46 + mggeo@xmath2/srgeo@xmath2 , @xmath28 = 0.96 , p = 7@xmath43c/@xmath44 + @xmath46 + mggeo@xmath2/cageo@xmath2 , @xmath28 = 0.93 , p = 2@xmath43c/@xmath44    where even though the average tolerance factor is still decreasing , in contrast to case ( 1 ) the polarization steadily _",
    "decreases_. what do we learn from this ?",
    "notice that in the first case the largest alkaline - earth cation we considered ( barium ) is keep constant while the a - site cation steadily become smaller . in the second case ,",
    "however , the smallest alkaline - earth cation we considered ( magnesium ) , is keep constant while the size of the a - cation is again steadily decreased .",
    "it would appear , at least within a family of compounds ( for which the b - cation is keep constant ) , that the polarization is dominated by the difference in the ionic radii of the a and a@xmath27-cations . by elucidating the microscopic mechanism that leads to the trilinear coupling we will indeed argue that @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the difference in tolerance factors of the abo@xmath2 constituents  @xcite , while @xmath50 and @xmath51 are coupling coefficients originating from the fact that there are actually two distinct contributions to the polarization .",
    "this leads to a simple , chemically intuitive , universal result for the polarization : @xmath52 \\approx\\delta\\tau ( 1-\\tau_{\\rm avg})\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a smooth function of @xmath54 and is approximately linear for all systems except those with very small tolerance factors ( so small that either the perovskite phase does nt form or the barrier to switching is so large that they are no longer good candidates for functional materials ) for which the quadratic term must be considered .",
    "now a clear correlation between the expected polarization and simple chemical descriptors  @xmath28 and @xmath49  is realized as shown in figure  [ tolvs](d ) where a nearly perfect fit over the entire tolerance factor range is seen .",
    "this result implies that it is possible to simultaneously decrease the ferroelectric switching barrier , by increasing @xmath28 , and increase the spontaneous polarization by increasing the difference in tolerance factors .",
    "to answer this question we need to understand the origin of this rotation - induced ferroelectricity .",
    "turning our attention back to the abo@xmath2 perovskite for a moment , it is well - known that rotations in perovskites are driven by the coordination preferences of the a - site cation  @xcite .",
    "the combination of octahedral rotation modes that establish the symmetry of the @xmath15 structure  @xmath20 and @xmath17  also favor displacements of the a - site cations .",
    "it turns out , because of the three dimensional connectivity of the perovskite lattice , the a - sites displace in an antiferroelectric pattern , the exact motion of which can be thought of as local , polar displacements confined to the two - dimensional ao layers but arranged 180@xmath55 out of phase along @xmath56 , as shown in figure  [ fig_x5](a ) .",
    "we denote the amplitude of this distortion as @xmath57 since it transforms like the irrep @xmath58 in @xmath18 . when we decompose the fully relaxed @xmath15 structures into symmetry - adapted basis functions of @xmath18 , we find that @xmath57 is non - zero only when both @xmath19 and @xmath16 are non - zero , as shown in figure  [ fig_x5](c ) . the @xmath58 mode itself , however , need not be unstable to appear in the @xmath15 structure . indeed , except for compounds with very small ( for perovskites ) tolerance factors ( @xmath59 0.91 )",
    ", the test suite of materials considered do not favor this motion in the absence of the a@xmath4a@xmath4c@xmath5 type of rotations , as indicated by the positive value of the force constant , @xmath60 ; see figure  [ fig_x5](b ) .",
    "the appearance of a finite @xmath57 in the @xmath15 structure can be accounted for phenomenologically by a trilinear coupling in the free energy of @xmath61 m , @xmath62 this implies that once the rotations become non - zero , a finite antiferroelectric structural distortion , @xmath57 , is induced  @xcite , @xmath63 the similarity between the trilinear coupling of rotations and the antiferroelectric distortion in the abo@xmath2 perovskites and the trilinear coupling of rotations and the polarization the abo@xmath2/a@xmath27bo@xmath2 perovskite sls is curious .",
    "could hybrid improper ferroelectricity actually originate from antiferroelectricity ?",
    "in figure  [ p_by_layer](a ) we plot a linear approximation to the layer - resolved polarization calculated from first principles ( see ref .   for an exact method ) for @xmath15 srsno@xmath2  @xcite where the antiferroelectric order can clearly be seen . with this picture in mind",
    "it is now clear that replacing alternating ao layers with a@xmath13o  for example , replacing alternating sro layers in srsno@xmath2 with bao to form ( sr / ba)sn@xmath7o@xmath1  creates chemically inequivalent a - sites .",
    "the small noncancellation of the layered polarization induced by the nominally antipolar @xmath58 displacements results in a macroscopic polarization and a polar space group ( @xmath64 ) , as shown in figure [ p_by_layer]b .",
    "_ this non - cancellation is the origin of hif in this class of materials and a route to turn the vast number of perovskite @xmath15 antiferroelectric materials into functional ferri - electrics_.    we now formulate a quantitative theory of hif that relies only on the properties of bulk abo@xmath2 and a@xmath13bo@xmath2 , and use it to derive the rule proposed above and displayed in figure  [ tolvs](d ) that allows for the simultaneous design of a large @xmath0 and low fe switching barrier .     and the contributions to the polarization , @xmath65 , by symmetry .",

    "this has been the essential problem with previous discussions of hif : all have used the ten atom @xmath67 cation - ordered perovskite as the reference structure ( the `` problem '' will become clear shortly ) .",
    "imagine instead that one was to write down an expansion of the total energy in terms of the symmetry - adapted modes that describe the transition from the cubic @xmath18 structure to the orthorhombic @xmath15 structure with the additional stipulation that the a - site is dynamically occupied by two atoms , a and a@xmath13 , with equal probability ( hence we are considering the reference structure as a dynamically disordered phase . to be able to describe the layered sl we therefore have to introduce an order parameter to account for the spontaneous ordering of a and a@xmath13 cations into layers .",
    "group - theoretic analysis shows that this order - disorder transition , shown in figure  [ cation_order](a ) , lowers the symmetry of @xmath18 to @xmath67 through a ` composition mode ' transforming as @xmath68 .",
    "further application of group - theoretic techniques shows that in addition to the invariants that describe the @xmath69 transition ( all the symmetry allowed couplings of @xmath19 , @xmath16 , and @xmath57 ) , two nontrivial invariants are introduced into the free energy of @xmath18 : a quadrilinear term , @xmath70 ( where the tildes refer to modes and coupling constants of the 5-atom , disordered @xmath18 structure ) and an additional trilinear term @xmath71 we emphasize two points .",
    "first , if not for a finite equilibrium value of @xmath72 , these nontrivial couplings between @xmath15 distortions and the polarization would be symmetry forbidden and therefore hybrid improper ferroelectricity would not possible .",
    "we show this explicitly from first - principles calculations of @xmath0 in the a@xmath4a@xmath4c@xmath5 structure as a function of cation - ordering , @xmath73 , within the virtual crystal approximation .",
    "this first - principles result , shown in fig .",
    "[ cation_order](b ) , shows that as the a - site ordering fully saturates the polarization is maximized , validating our interpretation derived from symmetry arguments .",
    "second , our analysis reveals that there are in fact two contributions to the total polarization : the first @xmath74 originates from the coupling to rotations ( eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] ) and is the contribution to @xmath0 usually thought of when discussing hybrid improper ferroelectricity .",
    "the second @xmath75 originates from a direct coupling to the antipolar displacements , eq .  [ eq4 ] ( a third minor point is to notice that when @xmath68 condenses , e.g. , when one uses the 10-atom ordered system as a reference structure , the unit cell doubles along [ 001 ] and the @xmath76 coupling causes the polar mode to mix with the antipolar mode resulting in a loss of distinction between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric distortions ) .",
    "note @xmath77 a - site is fully disordered ( @xmath78).,width=340 ]    rather than just the direct rotation contribution to the polarization , a surprising consequence of our analysis shows that in general there is a second independent contribution originating from antiferroelectricity , suggesting hybrid improper ferroelectricity could exist without rotations .",
    "the identification of a material with rotation - less hybrid improper ferroelectricity would be an exciting new avenue to pursue multifunctional materials as the switching barriers would be expected to be much lower than in proper ferroelectrics .",
    "antiferroelectricity without rotations , however , is rare ( if it exists at all ) in perovskites . indeed , as we discussed in a previous section , antiferroelectricity in @xmath15 perovskites is induced by the a@xmath4a@xmath4c@xmath5 rotations . in such classes of materials our analysis may therefore be rewritten in the form of an effective trilinear coupling .",
    "we integrate out the antiferroelectric mode @xmath79 to lowest order ( where @xmath80 is the force constant of the antiferroelectric mode renormalized by rotations and other distortions ) , and minimize over @xmath81 to obtain @xmath82 with @xmath83 ( see appendix for details ) , which leads to @xmath84    this analysis makes clear that the trilinear coupling coefficient , @xmath12 , is composed of two factors : the magnitude of the cation ordering , @xmath73 and a term that goes like @xmath85 .",
    "notice that the latter term differs from @xmath86 due to the direct coupling of the antipolar and polar distortions .",
    "therefore , if @xmath80 has a dependence on tolerance factor , then even in systems where antiferroelectricity by itself is stable ( such as the majority of the @xmath15 perovskites we have been discussing ) , the conjecture that the polarization is simply proportional to the amplitude of the rotations is incorrect .",
    "although interesting , the consequences of this are not profound as any physically reasonable force constant would be a smooth function of the tolerance factor and therefore can not be the origin of the discrepancy displayed in figure  [ tolvs](d ) .",
    "what is interesting , is the only remaining unknown ",
    "the cation ordering @xmath73 .",
    "one normally thinks of this as a number between 0 and 1 , reflecting the crystallographic difference in occupancy of a site . here",
    "this occupancy difference is irrelevant in the sense that in the ordered state of the @xmath15 sls , the important detail ( in relation to @xmath0 ) is the difference in the ` susceptibility ' of the a and a@xmath13 cations to displace from their ideal @xmath18 positions  @xcite .",
    "this can be made clear by considering the following example .",
    "imagine two different a / a@xmath13 cation - ordered materials that are both 100@xmath87 ordered , but in one case the tendency of the a and a@xmath13 cations to off - center is similar , whereas in the second system the a and a@xmath13 tendency to off - center varies drastically . even though cation ordering is 100@xmath87 in each of these systems",
    ", the consequences of this ordering should differ considering the ferrielectric mechanism described .",
    "as far as the polarization is concerned it is irrelevant that a and a@xmath13 may be different atoms only to have their tendency to off - center be similar as this would lead to a near complete cancelation of the layered dipoles ( just as if they were the same atom ) . _ in this case , it is therefore fruitful to think of the difference in the ability to displace between two a - sites as an absolute magnitude of the cation ordering . _",
    "we propose that the absolute magnitude of the cation ordering is reflected in the difference in magnitude of the antiferroelectric mode , @xmath57 , observed in the abo@xmath2 perovskite from that observed in a@xmath13bo@xmath2 , @xmath88 since @xmath57 is linear in @xmath89 ( see appendix ) , @xmath90 becomes a simple crystal chemistry rule to understand how the cation ordering contribution to @xmath0 is related to the difference in tolerance factor , @xmath49 , between abo@xmath2 and a@xmath27bo@xmath2 .",

    "each contribution , computed using only the first - principles structural distortion amplitudes , is a smooth monotonic function of tolerance factor when scaled by the difference in magnitude of the antiferroelectric mode .",
    "furthermore , the rotation - driven term from equation  [ p1 ] has an oppositely oriented polarization than the antiferroelectric - driven term from equation  [ p2 ] .",
    "notice that the rotation - driven polarization term dominates for small tolerance factor materials .",
    "quite surprisingly , however , it is the antiferroelectric contribution that dominates for materials with @xmath98 close to 1 where the switching barrier is small .",

    "based on what we learned in the previous section we would expect that as the tolerance factor of the abo@xmath2 perovskite making up the rp material decreases , the octahedral rotations , and consequently the polarization and the switching barrier , would get larger . as shown in figures  [ rp_1](b ) , figure  [ rp_2](a ) , and figure  [ rp_2](b ) , this is exactly the case .",
    "perhaps the large barrier to switch the polarization in ca@xmath2mn@xmath7o@xmath101 or ca@xmath2ti@xmath7o@xmath101 ( two known polar rps ) is the reason why ferroelectricity has yet to be shown experimentally .",

    "first note that unlike the perovskite superlattices , the polarization is a smooth and monotonic function of tolerance factor .",
    "this behavior is in fact consistent with the mechanism we outlined in the previous sections and can be easily understood by examining the rp structure .",
    "first , in even layered rps , such as the @xmath100 , the interface between the rock salt layer and the perovskite layer breaks the local inversion symmetry of the individual octahedra , therefore cation - ordering in not required as in the perovskite superlattices . additionally , as shown in the inset to figure  [ rp_2](b ) , the @xmath102 octahedral rotation pattern still induces antipolar a - cation displacements in the rp .",
    "given that the ao layers at the interface and the layer between the perovskites are different by symmetry , a net polarization will arise  _ hybrid improper ferroelectricity without cation ordering_. unlike the superlattice example however , the noncancellation of the a - cation displacements from this effect is very small , yet there is still a substantial polarization because of the additional ao layer present in the unit cell of the rp .",
    "the polarization varies smoothly because both of these contributions depend only on one type of a - cation antiferroelectric displacement and therefore only on one abo@xmath2 tolerance factor .",

    "the design rules tell us to create a / a cation ordered rp structures , as shown in figure [ rp_3 ] .",

    "while substitution of the a cation ( in between the perovskite blocks ) in @xmath107cao reduces the switching barrier and increases the polarization , table  [ superrp ] shows that substitution of the a cation ( in the rock salt layer ) reduces the barrier but also _ decreases _ the polarization .",
    "for example , reading across the first row we find    * @xmath107cao , p=12@xmath43c/@xmath44 , @xmath34e=406 mev + @xmath46 + @xmath108cao , p=3.4@xmath43c/@xmath44 , @xmath34e=182 mev + @xmath46 + @xmath109cao , p=3.5@xmath43c/@xmath44 , @xmath34e=145 mev +    does this contradict our chemical mismatch design strategy ?",
    "let us first look at @xmath107cao where a = a@xmath6 .",
    "as figure  [ rp_4](a ) shows , because of the weak symmetry breaking of the perovskite / rocksalt interface , the polarization originating from one of the ao layers nearly cancels that coming from the a@xmath6o layer and therefore in this material the polarization is approximately that originating from one cao layer . now with the substitution of the a@xmath6 site with a different cation , as shown in figure  [ rp_4](b ) the ao layer and the a@xmath6o layer no longer cancel . in the case where the a@xmath6 cation radius is much larger , for example a@xmath6=ba , the polarization in this a@xmath6o layer is nearly zero . according to the model we derived in the previous sections , this should lead to a polarization that is approximately twice the contribution from one cao layer multiplied by the ratio of the average abo@xmath2 tolerance factors , i.e. , @xmath110 15@xmath43c/@xmath44 , which compares amazingly well to the first - principles result of 17@xmath43c/@xmath44 .",
    "going across the row , the tolerance factor increases much faster than the mismatch increase and the polarization decreases , e.g. , the model predicts @xmath1102.3@xmath43c/@xmath44 ( first - principles value equals 3.5 @xmath43c/@xmath44 ) in @xmath109cao because the polarization from one cao layer is reduced by the substantial increase in the average tolerance factor as shown in figure  [ rp_4](c ) .     ruddlesden - popper structure ( without octahedral rotations ) with a single a - cation .",
