    "<S> events with a leptonic @xmath0-decay plus jets should contain top - quark signals , but a qcd @xmath1jets background must be separated . </S>",

    "<S> the main characteristics of @xmath9 pair production and decay are well known . </S>",
    "<S> current lower limits on @xmath3@xcite are well above @xmath10 , assuming the standard model ( sm ) , so all signals contain @xmath11 . as an experimental trigger , at least one @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is usually required to decay leptonically @xmath12 @xmath13 , providing a distinctive isolated high-@xmath14 lepton and large missing-@xmath14 ( denoted @xmath15 ) ; but large backgrounds , especially from qcd production of remain to be separated . </S>",
    "<S> if the second @xmath0 also decays leptonically and one @xmath2-jet is tagged , the resulting @xmath16 signal may be comparatively clean , but the event rate is not large and the top mass can not be directly reconstructed due to missing neutrinos @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of single - lepton top signals , where the second @xmath0 decays hadronically @xmath17 , are both larger event rate and direct top mass reconstructibility ; the draw - back here is the inherent uncertainty in qcd @xmath1jets background calculations at the parton level , especially for high jet multiplicity @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> some way must therefore be found to control or eliminate this background . since the top signals contain four hard partons @xmath19 while the qcd background has typically low @xmath18 and few @xmath2-quarks , the usual approach is to require large @xmath18 and @xmath2-tagging of at least one jet ; calculations then predict that the background is severely reduced relative to the signal@xcite , assuming this background comes mainly from @xmath20jets production with genuine @xmath2-jets .    in the present letter we point out that the main background actually comes from mistagged events containing no true @xmath2-jets . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transverse momentum @xmath21 of the trigger @xmath0 is another important characteristic , and investigate the interplay of @xmath22 , and @xmath2-tagging criteria in separating single - lepton top signals from @xmath1jets backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> the decay @xmath23 has a jacobian peak at @xmath24 in the @xmath7-restframe , giving a broad @xmath21 lab - frame distribution unlike the qcd background . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the background @xmath21-dependence differs less from the signal after imposing @xmath25 ; nevertheless a @xmath21 cut can be helpful for heavier top @xmath26  gev . </S>",
    "<S> once selection cuts have been imposed , we illustrate how the mass @xmath3 can be found by event reconstructions , with fitting criteria that further suppress backgrounds , and show how the signal purity can eventually be confirmed by lepton decay distributions . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions are detailed in ( i)(viii ) below .    </S>",
    "<S> analytic next - to - leading order calculations@xcite of inclusive @xmath0 production agree well with cdf data@xcite but can not address jet multiplicity with specific acceptance cuts , and anyway exist only for @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore make monte carlo parton - level calculations of @xmath28-jet backgrounds at leading order @xcite , interpreting final partons as jets if they satisfy the cuts , and imposing typical acceptance cuts : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is pseudo - rapidity , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are polar and azimuthal angles relative to the beam . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34 cuts approximate some effects of jet - finding and lepton - isolation criteria . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that at least one of the final jets is @xmath2-tagged by a vertex detector ( neglecting additional tagging via semileptonic decays , since the extra neutrino would blur reconstructions of @xmath35 kinematics ) . for @xmath1jets production , </S>",
    "<S> we neglect quark masses ( valid at high @xmath14 ) and use the scale @xmath36 with the mrs set d0 parton distributions@xcite and 4 flavors . the signals from @xmath37 production and decay are calculated at lowest order , without @xmath7-fragmentation effects because of the short top lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> however , we normalize the cross section to @xmath38 calculations , taking central values from ref.@xcite ( similar central values are given in ref.@xcite ) . to all calculations we add gaussian lepton- and jet - smearing prescriptions@xcite , based on cdf values@xcite , and </S>",
    "<S> evaluate @xmath39 from the overall @xmath40 imbalance .    in the cdf experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency for tagging one or more @xmath2-jets in a @xmath37 event is about 0.30 , corresponding to a probability @xmath41 per @xmath2-jet ; the probability of a fake @xmath2-tag is estimated to be @xmath42 per light - quark or gluon jet@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume a probability @xmath43 for a bogus @xmath44-jet tag . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for each final configuration is multiplied by the corresponding probability that at least one of the jets is tagged ; e.g. the tagged cross sections for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 production contain factors 0.04 , 0.08 , 0.32 , respectively .    tagged signal and background cross sections , for separate jet multiplicities @xmath18 , are shown versus @xmath21 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> solid curves denote the @xmath48 and @xmath49 signals for the case @xmath50  gev ( @xmath27 signals are negligible ) . </S>",
    "<S> dashed curves show total @xmath51 backgrounds from @xmath1jets . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from @xmath52 final states , containing two true @xmath2-jets @xcite , is shown by a dash - dotted curve . </S>",
    "<S> figure  1(a ) shows that + ( i ) the backgrounds from @xmath20jets channels that contain genuine @xmath2-jets and have attracted most attention @xcite , contribute much less than fake - tags . </S>",
    "<S> if cleaner tagging becomes possible , better background suppression will follow . </S>",
    "<S> + ( ii ) the @xmath1jets background has narrower @xmath21 dependence than the @xmath9 signal ; the signal gets broader as @xmath3 increases . </S>",
    "<S> + ( iii ) higher - multiplicity background components differ less sharply from the signal in their @xmath21 dependence .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  1(b ) compares integrated cross sections above a minimum cutoff @xmath53 , for multiplicities @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> dashed curves again denote background , solid ( dotted ) curves denote signals for @xmath55  gev ; in each case the lower curve refers to @xmath49 and the upper curve refers to the combined @xmath56 cross section . </S>",
    "<S> these results point to further conclusions : + ( iv ) for any given @xmath57 and luminosity , @xmath49 is always the best choice . </S>",
    "<S> adding @xmath58 to @xmath49 data gives more signal events @xmath59 but much more background @xmath60 , such that both @xmath61 and the statistical significance @xmath62 are decreased . </S>",
    "<S> + ( v ) for @xmath63  gev with @xmath49 , @xmath57 cuts confer little advantage ; they improve @xmath61 but reduce @xmath62 , leaving cleaner but less significant signals . </S>",
    "<S> + ( vi ) for heavier top , the broader signal can justify a @xmath57 cut ; e.g.  for @xmath64  gev and @xmath49 , a cut @xmath65  gev increases @xmath61 by @xmath66 with no loss of significance . </S>",
    "<S> greater advantages accrue for yet larger @xmath3 .    with a selected class of 4 jet events with a single - lepton and a @xmath2-tag , which are dominantly from @xmath37 , </S>",
    "<S> there are various ways to extract @xmath3 ( see e.g.  ref.@xcite ) ; we illustrate three . </S>",
    "<S> + ( a ) we can infer the neutrino longitudinal momentum from the @xmath67 mass shell constraint , within a two - fold ambiguity , assuming @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> then the distribution of invariant mass @xmath69 has a peak at @xmath3 on a combinatorial background . </S>",
    "<S> each of the two @xmath0-solutions is counted independently ; also , for multi - tagged events each tagged jet contributes independently to this distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) for @xmath70  gev and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> + ( b ) another approach is to identify two final untagged jets arising from @xmath71 , satisfying an approximate mass - shell constraint @xmath72 then the tagged jet @xmath73 and the remaining fourth jet @xmath74 are both presumably @xmath2-jets ( in the desired @xmath37 events ) , and the distributions of invariant mass @xmath75 and @xmath76 each contain a peak at @xmath3 on a combinatorial background ( that is smaller because no two - fold ambiguity is present in @xmath71 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , for @xmath70  gev and @xmath49 ; the distributions @xmath75 and @xmath76 are summed , giving 2 counts per event . </S>",
    "<S> it makes no difference here whether one or both of the non-@xmath0 jets are tagged ; both are regarded as @xmath2-jets . </S>",
    "<S> + ( c ) a better method is to reconstruct both leptonic and hadronic @xmath0 s . </S>",
    "<S> there are then 4 ways to pair these @xmath0 s ( one @xmath0 still has the two - fold ambiguity ) with the two remaining jets ( presumed to be @xmath2 and @xmath77 ) ; each pairing gives two top masses @xmath78 and @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> we select the pairing in which @xmath78 and @xmath79 are closest , subject to a reasonable limit @xmath80 and their mean value defines the reconstructed top mass @xmath81 : @xmath82 the two - fold @xmath12 ambiguity and pairing ambiguities are thus resolved@xcite and a sharper @xmath7-mass peak results , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) for @xmath70  gev with @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated @xmath37 signal here is 0.22 pb and the background is 0.017 pb , corresponding to 4.6 events on a background of 0.4 events with the present accumulated luminosity 21  pb@xmath83 at cdf . for @xmath64  gev </S>",
    "<S> the signal is 0.12 pb . figure  2 indicates a further conclusion : + ( vii ) full reconstruction as in ( c ) gives the cleanest and narrowest peak , hence best @xmath3 resolution . </S>",
    "<S> + we note that a different kind of approach is to use a maximum - likelihood analysis on individual signal events@xcite , with the background suppressed by tagging with @xmath84 and/or @xmath18 cuts .    </S>",
    "<S> the final event sample , after all cuts , can be examined to confirm the characteristics expected of a @xmath37 signal . </S>",
    "<S> first , the @xmath84 distribution should agree with fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the charged - lepton rapidity distribution should be forward / backward symmetric , unlike qcd @xmath0-events ; fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) compares the asymmetry @xmath85/ [ d \\sigma / dy(y_{\\ell } ) + d \\sigma / dy(-y_{\\ell})]$ ] for charged leptons . </S>",
    "<S> ( the @xmath86 sign is equal to the lepton s charge and @xmath87 is the hemisphere in the @xmath88 beam direction . ) also decay distributions in the collins - soper frame@xcite ( where the @xmath12 reconstruction gives simply a @xmath89 ambiguity ) , offer further distinctive differences between signal and background@xcite ; see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) and 3(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are shape differences in both @xmath33 and @xmath90 distributions , especially the latter . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude + ( viii ) charged lepton distributions offer additional purity checks on a selected @xmath37 signal .    </S>",
