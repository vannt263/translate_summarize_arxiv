    "the scenario of leptogenesis @xcite can be regarded as a cosmological consequence of the seesaw mechanism  @xcite , thereby providing an elegant unifying framework to account for both the observed baryon asymmetry of our universe ( bau ) and the smallness of the light - neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients are heavy majorana neutrinos , whose out - of - equilibrium decays provide an initial excess in lepton number ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this excess is subsequently converted to a net baryon number ( @xmath1 ) via the equilibrated @xmath2-violating interactions of the electroweak sphalerons  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-violating majorana mass terms , complex yukawa couplings and expansion of the universe fulfill the necessary sakharov conditions  @xcite for dynamically generating the bau , namely @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 violation , together with out - of - equilibrium dynamics . for a review on various aspects of leptogenesis , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "an attractive possibility of testing leptogenesis in foreseeable laboratory experiments is provided by the mechanism of resonant leptogenesis ( rl )  @xcite .",
    "this relies on the fact that the heavy majorana neutrino self - energy effects on the leptonic @xmath4-asymmetry ( the @xmath5-type effects ) become dominant  @xcite and get resonantly enhanced , when at least two of the heavy neutrinos have a small mass difference comparable to their decay widths  @xcite . the resonant enhancement of the @xmath4-asymmetry enables a successful low - scale leptogenesis  @xcite , whilst retaining perfect agreement with the active neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "this level of testability is further improved in the scenario of resonant @xmath6-genesis ( rl@xmath7 ) , where the final lepton asymmetry is dominantly generated and stored in a _ single _",
    "lepton flavour @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "in such models , the heavy neutrinos could be at a scale as low as the electroweak scale  @xcite , whilst still having sizable couplings to other charged - lepton flavours @xmath8 .",
    "thus , rl@xmath7 scenarios may be testable in the run - ii phase of the lhc  @xcite as well as in various low - energy experiments searching for lepton flavour / number violation  @xcite .    in rl models , with quasi - degenerate heavy majorana neutrinos",
    ", flavour effects in both heavy - neutrino  @xcite and charged - lepton  @xcite sectors , as well as the interplay between them , can play an important role in determining the final lepton asymmetry .",
    "these intrinsically - quantum effects can be accounted for by extending the classical flavour - diagonal boltzmann equations for the number densities of individual flavour species to a semi - classical evolution equation for a _ matrix of number densities _",
    ", analogous to the formalism presented in  @xcite for light neutrinos .",
    "this approach , the so - called ` density matrix ' formalism , has been adopted for various leptogenesis scenarios  @xcite .",
    "a consistent treatment of _ all _ pertinent flavour effects , including flavour mixing , oscillations and off - diagonal ( de)coherences , necessitates a _ fully _ flavour - covariant formalism , which was recently developed in  @xcite ( for an executive summary , see  @xcite ) .",
    "this provides a complete and unified description of rl .",
    "moreover , the resonant mixing of different heavy - neutrino flavours and coherent oscillations between them were found to be two _ distinct _ physical phenomena , in analogy with the experimentally - distinguishable phenomena of mixing and oscillations in the neutral @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath11-meson systems  @xcite . in particular , we draw attention to the phenomenon of oscillations via regeneration for the kaon system in medium  @xcite . a proper treatment of these flavour effects in this _",
    "fully _ flavour - covariant formalism could lead to a significant enhancement in the final lepton asymmetry , as compared to partially flavour - dependent or flavour - diagonal limits , as illustrated numerically in  @xcite within the context of an rl@xmath12 model .",
    "scenarios , the quantum ( de)coherence effects in the charged - lepton sector must also be included , which might further contribute to the enhancement of the final lepton asymmetry , depending upon the model parameters  @xcite . ]    on the other hand , there has been significant progress in the literature , attempting to go beyond the semi - classical ` density matrix ' approach  @xcite to transport phenomena by means of the quantum field - theoretic analogues of the boltzmann equations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , known as the kadanoff ",
    "baym ( kb ) equations  @xcite ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) .",
    "this system of quantum boltzmann equations is commonly derived from the cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis ( cjt ) effective action  @xcite of the schwinger - keldysh  @xcite closed - time path ( ctp ) formalism of non - equilibrium thermal field theory  @xcite .",
    "the kb equations are manifestly non - markovian , describing the non - equilibrium time - evolution of two - point correlation functions , and have been studied extensively in various scenarios of leptogenesis  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "these ` first - principles ' approaches to leptogenesis can , in principle , account consistently for all off - shell , finite - width and flavour effects , including thermal corrections . however , the loopwise perturbative expansion of non - equilibrium propagators is normally spoiled by mathematical pathologies , known as pinch singularities @xcite , arising from ill - defined products of dirac delta functions with identical arguments .",
    "thus , in order to define and extract physically - meaningful quantities , such as particle number densities , one often resorts to particular approximations , specifically gradient expansion of time - derivatives in the so - called wigner representation @xcite and quasi - particle ansaetze @xcite for the form of the dressed propagators .    recently , a new perturbative formulation of non - equilibrium thermal field theory  @xcite ( for an overview , see  @xcite ) was developed , which is free of the mathematically ill - defined pinch singularities previously thought to spoil such approaches . within this framework ,",
    "one may define a perturbative loopwise truncation scheme for quantum transport equations that is valid to all orders in a gradient expansion , whilst capturing non - markovian dynamics , memory and threshold effects . as a result",
    ", physically - meaningful particle number densities can be derived directly from the noether charge , without the need for quasi - particle ansaetze .    in this paper",
    ", we use the formalism of  @xcite to obtain a well - defined loopwise perturbative truncation scheme for the kb equations in the weakly - resonant regime of rl .",
    "this is achieved without resorting to a quasi - particle ansatz  for the dressed heavy - neutrino propagator .",
    "we find that the source term for the lepton asymmetry obtained in this kb approach is exactly the same as that derived in  @xcite using a semi - classical boltzmann approach .",
    "thus , we prove that there is _ no _ double - counting of flavour effects captured in the fully flavour - covariant semi - classical formalism of  @xcite . moreover",
    ", we confirm that flavour mixing and oscillations are two _ physically - distinct _ phenomena also in improved quantum boltzmann treatments , as is the case in the semi - classical approach .",
    "finally , we show that the use of kb or quasi - particle ansaetze for the resummed heavy - neutrino propagators captures _ only _ flavour oscillations and _ not _ the separate phenomenon of flavour mixing . as a result",
    ", the application of such approximations may lead to an underestimate of the generated lepton asymmetry by a factor of order two in the weakly - resonant regime .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we introduce a flavour - covariant scalar toy model of rl and describe its flavour - covariant canonical quantization within the context of perturbative non - equilibrium thermal field theory . in section  [ sec : source ] , we derive the heavy - neutrino and charged - lepton quantum transport equations relevant to the source term for the lepton asymmetry .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ sec : kbansatz ] , we illustrate that the kb ansaetze are not appropriate in the presence of particle mixing and that such approximations , when applied to the resummed heavy - neutrino propagator , discard the phenomenon of flavour mixing .",
    "we then proceed to derive the form of the source term for the lepton asymmetry , incorporating both flavour mixing and oscillation . in section  [ sec : approx ] , we derive an approximate analytic solution for the lepton asymmetry , making comparison with existing results .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "further technical details of the resummation of the heavy - neutrino yukawa couplings and thermal propagators are provided in  [ app : resprop ] .",
    "in order to study the role of heavy - neutrino flavour effects in rl within the kb formalism , but without the technical complications arising from the fermionic nature of the heavy neutrinos and charged leptons , we consider a simple toy model of rl with two real scalar fields @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) , one complex scalar field @xmath0 and a real scalar @xmath15 .",
    "this simple model includes all qualitatively important features of leptogenesis , where the two real scalar fields mimic heavy majorana neutrinos of two flavours and the complex scalar field models charged leptons of a single flavour .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 plays the role of the the standard model ( sm ) higgs field .",
    "the approximate global @xmath16 symmetry associated with the complex scalar field @xmath0 corresponds to the lepton number .",

    "@xmath3-violation will also imply @xmath4-violation , since @xmath4-transformations on the scalar fields are identical to @xmath3-transformations , up to a sign change of the spatial coordinates .",
    "finally , the out - of - equilibrium condition can be satisfied by the decays of @xmath13 in an expanding universe .    in order to define unambiguously the physical objects that enter into the heavy - neutrino rate equation",

    "[ fig : mix_osc],width=491 ]    in order to illustrate the _ distinction _ between the two physical phenomena contributing to the generation of the asymmetry , we plot in figure  [ fig : mix_osc ] the numerical solution of the rate equations and , starting from the initial conditions @xmath217 and @xmath211 . the black continuous line denotes the solution of the full rate equations , the red dotted line gives the contribution of mixing ( obtained neglecting off - diagonal number densities ) and the blue dashed line shows the contribution of oscillations ( obtained replacing @xmath218 ) . with this choice of initial conditions , coherences between the two heavy - neutrino flavours",
    "are initially absent .",
    "thus , at early times , only flavour mixing contributes to the asymmetry . on the other hand , as discussed in detail in @xcite , in order to have a significant contribution from oscillations , the off - diagonal entry @xmath219 needs first to be created by coherent decays and inverse decays .",
    "thus , as shown in figure  [ fig : mix_osc ] , this phenomenon becomes effective later than flavour mixing . at late times , both phenomena are present and give a similar contribution in the weakly - resonant strong - washout regime , providing an enhancement by a factor of order two with respect to mixing or oscillations alone .",
    "the different time behaviour outlined above , in addition to their differing physical origins , confirms that mixing and oscillations are two distinct physical phenomena and that both their contributions to the asymmetry need to be taken into account . finally , we point out that the oscillatory behaviour in figure  [ fig : mix_osc ] does not result from non - markovian memory effects as studied , for example , in @xcite . instead , it is due to the oscillation of the heavy - neutrino coherences .",
    "the non - markovian finite - time effects are safely neglected in the strong - washout regime of interest here .    before concluding this section",
    ", we would like to stress here that the phenomenon of coherent heavy - neutrino oscillations , discussed above , is an @xmath136 effect on the _ total _ lepton asymmetry  @xcite and so differs from the @xmath122 mechanism proposed in  @xcite .",

    ", we have assumed that the momentum distribution in kinetic equilibrium is a flavour singlet . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this approximation is valid in the resonant regime , but not in the hierarchical one .",
    "a detailed study of this phenomenon in the hierarchical regime goes beyond the scope of this paper and will be given elsewhere .",
    "we have presented a novel approach to the study of flavour effects in resonant leptogenesis by embedding the fully flavour - covariant formalism developed in  @xcite into the perturbative non - equilibrium thermal field theory formulated in  @xcite . in this formulation",
    ", one may expand the schwinger - dyson series diagrammatically in a perturbative loopwise sense , without encountering pinch singularities .",
    "moreover , one may define physically - meaningful number densities at any order in perturbation theory , without necessitating the use of any quasi - particle ansatz .",
    "the truncation of the resulting transport equations proceeds in a two - fold manner : ( i ) spectrally , corresponding to the choice of observables being counted in the quantum transport equation and ( ii ) statistically , by which the set of processes causing the non - equilibrium evolution of the system are fixed .    within this perturbative non - equilibrium field - theoretical framework ,",
    "we have confirmed the results previously obtained in @xcite via a semi - classical formalism , reproducing them quantitatively at @xmath136 in the weakly - resonant regime .",
    "the main physical result is that the mixing of different heavy - neutrino flavours and the oscillations between them are two _ distinct _ physical phenomena .",
    "the first is driven by the @xmath4-``even '' number density @xmath223 and the @xmath4-``odd '' rate @xmath224_\\alpha^{\\phantom \\alpha \\beta}$ ] , whereas the second is mediated by the @xmath4-``odd '' off - diagonal coherences @xmath225_{12}$ ] .",
    "this is akin to the mixing and oscillation phenomena observed experimentally in @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath1-meson systems .",
    "as identified in @xcite , both the phenomena contribute at @xmath136 with comparable magnitude in the weakly - resonant regime .",
    "the strong - washout form of the asymmetry due to oscillations is in agreement with the results obtained in other kb studies @xcite and in the flavour - covariant semi - classical approach in @xcite .",
    "however , as emphasized throughout this article , the kb approach presented here includes _ also _ the effect of mixing , as given by .",
    "this contribution agrees with the one identified in @xcite , and re - obtained in @xcite , once the thermal masses and widths are used in the formulae given there .",
    "the appearance of this additional @xmath136 contribution , not present in previous kb studies , is due to the fact that we do not , as is typically the case , use a kb ansatz , or other equivalent approximations , for the dressed heavy - neutrino propagators .",
    "we have shown that these approximations implicitly discard mixing effects . in the approach detailed here ,",
    "such approximations are not required , since we are able to express the source term for the asymmetry in terms of the spectrally - free heavy - neutrino propagators , with the effect of mixing being captured by the effective resummed yukawa couplings [ cf .  ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : mix_osc ] , we have shown explicitly that mixing and oscillations are two distinct physical phenomena that contribute separately to the asymmetry , since their time behaviour , in addition to their physical origin , is different . with this approach to solving the quantum transport equations , we have justified , at leading order in the weakly - resonant regime , the semi - classical approach adopted in  @xcite of describing the effect of mixing by means of effective @xmath4-violating yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "finally , we emphasise that mixing and oscillation contributions to the bau are not exclusive to leptogenesis but generic phenomena applicable to baryogenesis models involving mixing of states . therefore , both contributions should be included for precise quantitative predictions of the generated baryonic asymmetry in the universe .",
