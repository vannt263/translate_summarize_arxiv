    "randomness and computation are related to two basic elements of bounded rationality modeling : ( a ) players can not generate truly random actions ; ( b ) they can not implement arbitrarily complex strategies .",
    "when rationality is computationally constrained , true randomness can be replaced by pseudo - randomness : one need not generate truly random actions , just actions whose pattern is too complicated for any rationally bounded agent to be able to recognize .",
    "algorithmic randomness is the field of computer science that studies the relations between computability and randomness .",
    "it provides the rigorous definitions and analytic tools to address questions involving the tension between the two above elements of bounded rationality . on the other hand",
    ", the present paper applies game theory to solve a problem from algorithmic randomness by recasting the problem as an extensive form game .",
    "gambler 0 , the cousin of the casino owner , repeatedly bets on red / black .",
    "she is only allowed to wager even ( positive ) integers , i.e. , she can bet 4 dollars on black , then 10 on red , then 2 on black , etc .",
    "( `` betting 4 on black '' means that you gain 4 if black occurred , and lose 4 if red did ) .",
    "then the _ regular _ gamblers make their bets , and they are only allowed to wager odd integers .",
    "the red / black outcome is not decided by a lottery ; rather , the casino owner chooses red or black .",
    "he attempts to aid gambler 0 by his choices .",
    "all gamblers start with some finite , not necessary equal , wealth . going into debt",
    "is not allowed , i.e. , you can not bet more than you have . say that a gambler `` succeeds '' if , along the infinite stream of bets , her wealth tends to infinity .",
    "the `` home team '' , consisting of the casino owner and gambler 0 , wins if and only if gambler 0 succeeds while the other gamblers do not .    in the case",
    "depicted above , gambler 0 uses even integers as wagers , and the others use odd wagers .",
    "we will see that the home team can guarantee a win in this case and that they could not had it been the other way round , namely , odd integers for gambler 0 and even integers for the others . in general , let @xmath0 be the wagers allowed to gambler 0 , and @xmath1 those allowed to the other gamblers ( @xmath4 being any pair of subsets of the positive real numbers ) .",
    "we ask for which @xmath0 and @xmath1 the home team can _ guarantee a win _ , in the following sense : gambler 0 can choose a strategy that guarantees that for any strategies that the other gamblers choose the casino can choose a sequence so that the home team wins .    as a simple example ,",
    "suppose that apart from gambler 0 there is only one more , regular , gambler ( call him gambler 1 ) , and first , let @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "then the home team can not guarantee a win : for any pure strategy of gambler 0 , let gambler 1 employ the strategy that is a copy of it , only wagering 1 instead of 2 .",
    "then the gains ( or losses ) of 1 are exactly half the gains of 0 .",
    "therefore , if gambler 0 succeeds , so does gambler 1 .",
    "second , let @xmath1 be as before , and let @xmath7 . then the home team can guarantee a win as follows . the strategy of gambler 0 is simple : she always bets on red ; at the start she wagers two dollars , and keeps doing this as long as she wins .",
    "then , after the first loss , she switches to wagering one dollar ad infinitum .",
    "the casino strategy chooses , in a first phase , red every time , until the wealth of 0 exceeds 1 s wealth by more than three dollars ( note that this is bound to eventually happen , since in the first phase 0 gains two every time , while 1 gains at most one ) .",
    "then it chooses black once ( after which the wealth of 0 still exceeds the wealth of 1 , as 0 lost two dollars and 1 gained no more than one dollar ) . then comes the second phase , where the casino always chooses the opposite color to what gambler 1 bet on , and chooses red if 1 did not bet anything .",
    "this strategy of the casino ensures that , during the second phase , 1 can not make a non - zero bet more than a finite number of times before he goes broke ( and if 1 does go broke , 0 still does not ) .",
    "hence , whatever strategy he chooses , 1 will not succeed , while 0 will .",
    "this casino game is related to the notions of randomness and computability . in the theory of _ algorithmic randomness _ , a sequence of zeros and ones is called _ computably random _ if there exists no computable strategy that succeeds against it ( thus , the sequence is in some sense unpredictable ) . for a set @xmath0 of positive real numbers ,",
    "a sequence is _",
    "@xmath0-valued random _ if there exists no computable gambling strategy ( aka `` martingale '' ) , with wagers in @xmath0 , that succeeds against it .",
    "hence we may compare two sets of reals @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and ask whether @xmath1-valued randomness implies @xmath0-valued randomness . in other words , whether for any casino sequence @xmath8 , and a computable @xmath0-martingale ( gambling strategy with wagers in @xmath0 ) that succeeds on @xmath8 , there exists a @xmath1-martingale that succeeds on @xmath8 . and in terms of our casino game",
    ", suppose that _ every _ computable @xmath1-martingale is employed by some regular gambler .",
    "then the question is whether there exist a computable @xmath0-martingale and a casino sequence , such that the home team wins .",
    "there are countably many computable strategies . in many cases",
    "this countability , rather than the specific type of admissible strategies , is the essential point in the analysis .",
    "this naturally leads to the following setting ( definition [ def countable anticipation ] ) : gambler 0 s wagers are in @xmath0 , and there are countably many regular players , whose wagers are in @xmath1 .",
    "we will say that @xmath0 _ evades _",
    "@xmath1 if the home team can guarantee a win .",
    "this is the central notion in our paper .",
    "thus , we are not directly concerned with computability , or other complexity considerations and @xmath1 are recursive sets of rational numbers our analysis applies to the question whether every @xmath1-valued random is @xmath0-valued random . ] , but rather take a more abstract view : we only require that the number of strategies against which the home team needs to concurrently combat is countable ( see also remark [ rem : effective ] below ) .",
    "one may consider a few variants of this settings ( see below ) .",
    "if @xmath0 does not evade @xmath1 , we say that @xmath1 _ anticipates _ @xmath0 . if @xmath1 contains @xmath0 , then clearly @xmath1 anticipates @xmath0 , because the strategy of gambler 1 can be an exact copy of 0 s strategy ( and there is even no need for countably many regular gamblers , one is enough ) . therefore",
    ", if 0 succeeds , so does 1 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath1 contains a multiple of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath9 for some @xmath10 , then @xmath1 anticipates @xmath0 : as in the example above , the @xmath1-strategy can be the same as the @xmath0-strategy up to the multiple @xmath3 ( i.e. , the wagers are multiplied by @xmath3 ) , and therefore the gains are the same , multiplied by @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the even integers anticipate the odd integers ( or the whole set of integers , for that matter ) .",
    "thus , @xmath1 containing a multiple of @xmath0 is a sufficient condition for @xmath1 to anticipate @xmath0 .",
    "is it also a necessary condition ?",
    "@xcite showed that if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are finite , then it is necessary .",
    "they asked whether this characterization extends to infinite @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( note that their framework is that of algorithmic randomness , i.e. , it only allows for computable martingales ) .",
    "in other words :    * does @xmath1 not containing a multiple of @xmath0 imply that @xmath0 evades @xmath1 ?",
    "theorem  [ thm : suffic ] implies a negative answer to this question . ) .",
    "] thus , for example , the segment @xmath11 $ ] anticipates the set @xmath12 , although it does not contain any multiple of it .",
    "still , although @xmath13 does not hold in general , we will see classes of pairs @xmath4 where @xmath13 does hold .",
    "theorem  [ theorem bounded ] says that if @xmath0 is bounded , and @xmath14 is bounded away from 0 , then @xmath13 holds .",
    "thus , for example , the set @xmath15 evades the positive integers .",
    "theorem [ theorem well ordered ] says that if @xmath1 is well - ordered , then @xmath13 holds .",
    "thus , for example , the set of even integers evades the odds .",
    "now let us consider the following version of our casino game , whose description is more like that of a `` classic '' repeated game .",
    "at each stage of the repeated game , first gambler 0 makes a bet ; then , after observing it , the ( team of ) regular gamblers each make their bets ; and then the casino chooses a red / black outcome .",
    "all of our results apply to this version as well .",
    "the difference between our definition of evasion and the description of this game is that in the former setting , the regular gamblers knew the _ strategy _ of gambler 0 ( i.e. , including her future actions ) , gambler 0 did not observe their past actions , and the casino knew the strategies of all gamblers",
    ". one may consider many such variations to the settings , and our results are robust to all of them  whether gambler 0 observes anything or not , whether the regular gamblers know her future bets or not , and whether the casino knows the future bets or not .",
    "previous work on martingales with restricted wagers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) employed various solutions in various specific situations .",
    "the present paper proposes a systematic treatment that applies to most of the previously studied situations , as well as many others .",
    "our proofs are elementary and constructive .",
    "also , the proposed construction is recursive : it does not rely on what the strategies do in the future ; therefore we believe our method can be useful in many frameworks where computational or other constraints are present .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
