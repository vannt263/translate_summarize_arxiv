    "the ` maximal abelian cover ' of a graph plays a key role in sunada s work on topological crystallography @xcite .",
    "just as the universal cover of a connected graph @xmath0 has the fundamental group @xmath3 as its group of deck transformations , the maximal abelian cover , denoted @xmath4 , has the abelianization of @xmath3 as its group of deck transformations .",
    "it thus covers every other connected cover of @xmath0 whose group of deck transformations is abelian .",
    "since the abelianization of @xmath3 is the first homology group @xmath1 , there is a close connection between the maximal abelian cover and homology theory .    in this paper",
    "we prove that for a large class of graphs , the maximal abelian cover can naturally be embedded in the vector space @xmath2 .",
    "we call this embedded copy of @xmath4 a ` topological crystal ' .",
    "the symmetries of the original graph can be lifted to symmetries of its topological crystal , but the topological crystal also has an @xmath5-dimensional lattice of translational symmetries . in the 3-dimensional case ,",
    "the topological crystal can serve as the blueprint for an actual crystal , with atoms at the vertices and bonds along the edges .",
    "the most famous example arises from the tetrahedron . here",
    "@xmath0 is the complete graph on 4 vertices :    0.5em since @xmath2 is 3-dimensional , the corresponding topological crystal is a graph embedded in 3-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "it looks like this :    up to translation this crystal has 4 kinds of atoms , corresponding to the 4 vertices of the tetrahedron .",
    "each atom has 3 equally distant neighbors lying in a plane at @xmath6 angles from each other .",
    "these planes lie in 4 families , each parallel to one face of a regular tetrahedron .",
    "this structure was discovered by the crystallographer laves @xcite and dubbed the ` laves graph ' by coxeter @xcite .",
    "later sunada called it the ` @xmath7 lattice ' , studied its energy minimization properties , and raised the question of whether it could serve as the pattern for a crystal form of carbon @xcite .",
    "this form of carbon has not yet been seen , but the laves graph plays a role in the structure of certain butterfly wings @xcite .",
    "the laves graph is exciting because it was studied mathematically before being found in nature .",
    "a more familiar example arises from this graph :    the corresponding topological crystal provides the pattern for a diamond :    up to translation this crystal has two kinds of atoms , corresponding to the two vertices of the original graph .",
    "the general construction of topological crystals was developed by kotani and sunada @xcite , who used the term ` standard realization ' , and later by eon @xcite , who used the term ` archetypical representation ' .",
    "sunada uses ` topological crystal ' for an even more general concept @xcite , but we only need the following special case .",
    "we start with a graph @xmath0 .",
    "this has a space @xmath8 of 0-chains , which are formal linear combinations of vertices , and a space @xmath9 of 1-chains , which are formal linear combinations of edges .",
    "there is a boundary operator @xmath10 the linear operator sending any edge to the formal difference of its two endpoints .",
    "the kernel of this operator is the space of 1-cycles , @xmath11 .",
    "there is an inner product on the space of 1-chains such that edges form an orthonormal basis .",
    "this determines an orthogonal projection @xmath12 for a graph , @xmath11 is isomorphic to the first homology group @xmath2 .",
    "so , to obtain the topological crystal of @xmath0 , we need only embed its maximal abelian cover @xmath4 in @xmath11 .",
    "we do this by embedding @xmath4 in @xmath9 and then projecting it down via @xmath13 .    to accomplish this , we need to fix a basepoint for @xmath0 . each path @xmath14 in @xmath0 starting at this basepoint determines a 1-chain @xmath15 .",
    "it is easy to show that these 1-chains correspond to the vertices of @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the graph @xmath4 has an edge from @xmath15 to @xmath16 whenever the path @xmath17 is obtained by adding an extra edge to @xmath14 .",
    "we can think of this edge as a straight line segment from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the hard part is checking that the projection @xmath13 maps this copy of @xmath4 into @xmath11 in a one - to - one manner . in theorem [ embedding_theorem ]",
    "we prove that this happens precisely when the graph @xmath0 has no ` bridges ' : that is , edges whose removal would disconnect @xmath0 .",
    "kotani and sunada @xcite noted that this condition is necessary ; with considerably more work we show it is also sufficient .",
    "the main technical tool is lemma [ decomposition_lemma_2 ] , which for any path @xmath14 decomposes the 1-chain @xmath15 into manageable pieces .",
    "we call the resulting copy of @xmath4 embedded in @xmath11 a ` topological crystal ' . for example , let @xmath0 be this graph :    since @xmath0 has 3 edges , the space of 1-chains is 3-dimensional .",
    "since @xmath2 is 2-dimensional , the space of 1-cycles is a plane in this 3-dimensional space .",
    "if we consider paths @xmath14 in @xmath0 starting at the red vertex , form the 1-chains @xmath15 , and project them down to this plane , we obtain the following picture :    here the 1-chains @xmath15 are the white and red dots .",
    "these are the vertices of @xmath4 , while the line segments between them are the edges of @xmath4 . projecting these vertices and edges onto the plane of 1-cycles ,",
    "we obtain the topological crystal for @xmath0 .",
    "the blue dots come from projecting the white dots onto the plane of 1-cycles , while the red dots already lie on this plane .",
    "the resulting topological crystal provides the pattern for graphene , a 2-dimensional form of carbon :    2em    for any connected graph @xmath0 , there is a covering map @xmath18 the vertices of @xmath4 come in different kinds , or ` colors ' , depending on which vertex of @xmath0 they map to .",
    "we study the group of ` covering symmetries ' , @xmath19 , consisting of all symmetries of @xmath4 that map vertices of the same color to vertices of the same color .",
    "in lemma [ covering_lemma_1 ] we prove that this group fits into a short exact sequence @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the group of all symmetries of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , every symmetry of @xmath0 is covered by some symmetry of @xmath4 , while @xmath1 acts on @xmath4 in a way that preserves the color of every vertex . in theorem [ symmetry_theorem_2 ]",
    "we prove that @xmath19 also acts as symmetries of the topological crystal associated to @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , there is an action of @xmath19 as affine isometries of @xmath2 for which the embedding of @xmath4 in this space is equivariant . in this action , the subgroup @xmath1 acts as translations .",
    "these results are most interesting in cases where @xmath0 is highly symmetrical .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath21 acts transitively on ` arcs ' , meaning pairs consisting of a vertex and an edge incident to that vertex .",
    "in this case @xmath19 acts transitively on the arcs of the corresponding topological crystal .",
    "one example of this phenomena is the laves graph , coming from the tetrahedron .",
    "the symmetry group of the tetrahedron is the coxeter group @xmath22 thus , the group of covering symmetries of the laves graph is an extension of @xmath23 by @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , the vertices and edges of any platonic solid form a graph whose symmetry group acts transitively on arcs .",
    "for example , the symmetry group of the cube and octahedron is the coxeter group @xmath25 since the cube has 6 faces , @xmath2 is 5-dimensional for the cube graph .",
    "the corresponding topological crystal is thus 5-dimensional , and its group of covering symmetries , an extension of @xmath26 by @xmath27 , acts transitively on arcs .",
    "similarly , the octahedron gives a 7-dimensional topological crystal whose group of covering symmetries , an extension of @xmath28 by @xmath29 , acts transitively on arcs .",
    "the cuboctahedron can be seen either as a truncated cube or a truncated octahedron , so it too has @xmath26 as its symmetry group , and in fact this group acts transitively on arcs .",
    "since the cuboctahedron has 14 faces , we obtain a 13-dimensional crystal whose covering symmetries act transitively on arcs .",
    "the symmetry group of the dodecahedron and icosahedron is @xmath30 and these solids give crystals of dimensions 11 and 19 .",
    "the icosidodecahedron can be seen either as a truncated dodecahedron or a truncated icosahedron ; it has @xmath31 as its symmetry group , and this group acts transitively on arcs .",
    "it has 32 faces , so it gives a 31-dimensional crystal whose covering symmetries act transitively on arcs .",
    "there is also an infinite family of degenerate platonic solids called ` hosohedra ' with two vertices , @xmath5 edges and @xmath5 faces .",
    "these faces can not be made flat , since each face has just 2 edges , but that is not relevant to our construction : the vertices and edges still give a graph .",
    "for example , when @xmath32 , we have the ` hexagonal hosohedron ' :    the symmetry group of the @xmath5-gonal hosohedron is @xmath33 , where the coxeter group @xmath34 is a dihedral group , and @xmath35 acts to interchange the two vertices while fixing the edges .",
    "the automorphism group of its underlying graph is @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding crystal has dimension @xmath37 , and its group of covering symmetries is an extension of @xmath36 by @xmath38 .",
    "the case @xmath39 gives the graphene crystal , while @xmath40 gives the diamond .",
    "there are many other examples of graphs whose symmetry group acts transitively on arcs .",
    "one is the petersen graph :    the symmetry group of the petersen graph is @xmath41 .",
    "this graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges , so its euler characteristic is @xmath42 , which implies that its space of 1-cycles is 6-dimensional .",
    "it thus gives a 6-dimensional crystal whose group of covering symmetries , an extension of @xmath41 by @xmath43 , acts transitively on arcs .",
    "two more nice examples come from klein s quartic curve , a riemann surface of genus three on which the 336-element group @xmath44 acts as isometries .",
    "these isometries preserve a tiling of klein s quartic curve by 56 triangles , with 7 meeting at each vertex .",
    "this picture is topologically correct , though not geometrically :    from this tiling we obtain a graph @xmath0 embedded in klein s quartic curve .",
    "this graph has @xmath45 edges and @xmath46 vertices , so it has euler characteristic @xmath47 .",
    "it thus gives a 61-dimensional topological crystal whose group of covering symmetries , an extension of @xmath44 by @xmath48 , acts transitively on arcs .",
    "there is also a dual tiling of klein s curve by 24 heptagons , 3 meeting at each vertex .",
    "this gives a graph with 84 edges and 56 vertices , hence euler characteristic @xmath49 . from this",
    "we obtain a 29-dimensional topological crystal whose group of covering symmetries is an extension of @xmath44 by @xmath50 . again , this group acts transitively on arcs .",
    "another interesting property of a topological crystal is its ` packing fraction ' .",
    "the set @xmath51 of atoms is contained in the lattice @xmath52 obtained by projecting the integral 1-chains down to the space of 1-cycles : @xmath53 we can ask what fraction of the points in this lattice are actually atoms . we call this the ` packing fraction ' , and since @xmath54 acts as translations on both @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we define it to be @xmath55 for example , suppose @xmath0 is this graph :    1em    then the packing fraction is @xmath56 , as can be seen here :    1em    1em    for any bridgeless connected graph @xmath0 , we prove in theorem [ packing_fraction_theorem ] that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the set of vertices and @xmath59 is the set of spanning trees .",
    "the main tool here is bacher , de la harpe and nagnibeda s work on integral cycles and integral cuts @xcite .",
    "here is some data about the examples discussed above .",
    "we used mathematica to count the spanning trees . in this table",
    ", @xmath60 denotes an extension of the group @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",
    "we start by reviewing some concepts from sunada s _ topological crystallography _",
    "it is convenient to work with graphs having two copies of each edge , one pointing in each direction .",
    "thus , he defines a * * @xmath63 to consist of a set @xmath58 of * * , a set @xmath64 of * * , maps @xmath65 assigning to each edge its * * and * * , and a map @xmath66 sending each edge to its * * , obeying @xmath67 and @xmath68 for all @xmath69 .    if @xmath70 and @xmath71 we write @xmath72 , and draw @xmath73 as an interval with an arrow on it pointing from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "we write @xmath76 as @xmath77 , and draw @xmath77 as the same interval as @xmath73 , but with its arrow reversed .",
    "the equations obeyed by @xmath78 say that taking the inverse of @xmath72 gives an edge @xmath79 and that @xmath80 .",
    "no edge can be its own inverse .",
    "a * * , say @xmath81 , is a pair of functions , one sending vertices to vertices and one sending edges to edges , that preserve the source , target and inverse maps . by abuse of notation",
    "we call both of these functions @xmath82 .    from a graph @xmath0",
    "we can build a topological space @xmath83 called its * * .",
    "we do this by taking one point for each vertex and gluing on one copy of @xmath84 $ ] for each edge @xmath72 , gluing the point @xmath85 to @xmath74 and the point @xmath86 to @xmath75 , and then identifying the interval for each edge @xmath73 with the interval for its inverse by means of the map @xmath87 .",
    "any map of graphs gives rise to a continuous map between their geometric realizations , and we say a map of graphs is a * * if this continuous map is a covering map . for simplicity we denote the fundamental group of @xmath83 by @xmath3 , and similarly for other topological invariants of @xmath83 .",
    "however , there are contexts in which we need to distinguish between a graph @xmath0 and its geometric realization @xmath83 .",
    "any connected graph @xmath0 has a * * , meaning a cover @xmath88 such that every cover factors through this one .",
    "the geometric realization of @xmath89 is connected and simply connected .",
    "the fundamental group @xmath3 acts as * * of @xmath89 , meaning invertible maps @xmath90 such that @xmath91 .",
    "we can take the quotient of @xmath89 by the action of any subgroup @xmath92 and get a cover @xmath93 .",
    "in particular , if we take @xmath61 to be the commutator subgroup of @xmath3 , we call the graph @xmath94 the * * of the graph @xmath0 , and denote it by @xmath4 .",
    "we obtain a cover @xmath95 whose group of deck transformations is the abelianization of @xmath3 .",
    "this is just the first homology group @xmath1 , which is a free abelian group .",
    "we need a concrete description of the maximal abelian cover .",
    "we start with the universal cover , but first we need some preliminaries on paths in graphs .    given vertices @xmath96 in @xmath0 , define a * * from @xmath97 to @xmath98 to be a word of edges @xmath99 with @xmath100 for some vertices @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we allow the word to be empty if and only if @xmath104 ; this gives the * * from @xmath97 to itself .",
    "given a path @xmath14 from @xmath97 to @xmath98 we write @xmath105 , and we write the trivial path from @xmath97 to itself as @xmath106 .",
    "we define the composite of paths @xmath107 and @xmath108 via concatenation of words , obtaining a path we call @xmath109 .",
    "we call a path from a vertex @xmath97 to itself a * * based at @xmath97 .",
    "we say two paths from @xmath97 to @xmath98 are * * if one can be obtained from the other by repeatedly introducing or deleting subwords of the form @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",

    "the vertices of @xmath89 are defined to be the homotopy classes of paths @xmath113 { \\colon}x_0 \\to x$ ] where @xmath97 is arbitrary . the edges in @xmath89 from the vertex @xmath112 { \\colon}x_0 \\to x$ ] to the vertex @xmath114 { \\colon}x_0 \\to y$ ] are defined to be the edges @xmath69 with @xmath116 = [ \\delta]$ ] .",
    "in fact , there is always at most one such edge .",
    "there is an obvious map of graphs @xmath88 sending each vertex @xmath113 { \\colon}x_0 \\to x$ ] of @xmath89 to the vertex @xmath97 of @xmath0 .",
    "this map is a cover .",
    "now we are ready to construct the maximal abelian cover @xmath4 . for this",
    ", we impose a further equivalence relation on paths , which is designed to make composition commutative whenever possible .",
    "however , we need to be careful . if @xmath107 and @xmath117 , the composites @xmath118 and @xmath119 are both well - defined if and only if @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath122 and @xmath119 share the same starting point and share the same ending point if and only if @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "if all four of these equations hold , both @xmath14 and @xmath125 are loops based at @xmath97 .",
    "so , we shall impose the relation @xmath126 only in this case .",
    "we say two paths are * * if one can be obtained from another by :    * repeatedly introducing or deleting subwords @xmath110 where @xmath111 , and/or * repeatedly replacing subwords of the form @xmath127 by those of the form @xmath128 , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are loops based at the same vertex .",
    "our use of the term ` homologous ' is a bit nonstandard , but we shall see some nice relations to homology theory , which we hope justifies this terminology .",
    "we denote the homology class of a path @xmath14 by @xmath131 .",
    "note that if two paths @xmath105 , @xmath132 are homologous then @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "thus , the starting and ending points of a homology class of paths are well - defined , and given any path @xmath107 we write @xmath133 .",
    "the composite of homology classes is also well - defined if we set @xmath134 .",
    "we construct the maximal abelian cover of a connected graph @xmath0 just as we constructed its universal cover , but using homology classes rather than homotopy classes of paths .",
    "fix a basepoint @xmath115 for @xmath0 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath4 , or * * , are defined to be the homology classes of paths @xmath135 where @xmath97 is arbitrary .",
    "any edge of @xmath4 , or * * , goes from some atom @xmath136 to the some atom @xmath137 .",
    "the bonds from @xmath138 to @xmath139 are defined to be the edges @xmath69 with @xmath140 .",
    "there is at most one bond between any two atoms .",
    "again we have a covering map @xmath18    the homotopy classes of loops based at @xmath115 form a group , with composition as the group operation .",

    "this is isomorphic as the fundamental group of the space associated to @xmath0 . by our construction of the universal cover ,",
    "@xmath3 is also the set of vertices of @xmath89 that are mapped to @xmath115 by @xmath141 .",
    "furthermore , any element @xmath113 \\in \\pi_1(x ) $ ] defines a deck transformation of @xmath89 that sends each vertex @xmath142 { \\colon}x_0 \\to x $ ] to the vertex @xmath113 [ \\delta ] { \\colon}x_0 \\to x$ ] .",
    "similarly , the homology classes of loops based at @xmath115 form a group with composition as the group operation . since the additional relation used to define homology classes is precisely that needed to make composition of homology classes of loops commutative , this group is the abelianization of @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore isomorphic to the first homology group @xmath143 of the geometric realization of @xmath0 . by our construction of the maximal abelian cover , @xmath1 is also the set of vertices of @xmath4 that are mapped to @xmath115 by @xmath144 .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath149 is a self - dual lattice in @xmath9 , since edges form an orthonormal basis .",
    "it follows that @xmath54 is an integral lattice in @xmath11 , where the latter space inherits its inner product from @xmath9 .",
    "however , @xmath54 is not in general self - dual , and this gives another description of the lattice @xmath52 :    [ dual_lemma ] if @xmath0 is a finite graph then @xmath438 .",
    "this was shown by bacher , de la harpe and nagnibeda ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) .    using this",
    "we can prove :    [ packing_fraction_theorem ] if @xmath0 is a finite graph without bridges , then its packing fraction is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the set of vertices of @xmath0 and @xmath59 is the set of spanning trees in @xmath0 . in fact",
    "@xmath439 and @xmath440    to show that @xmath441 , we use several facts .",
    "first , @xmath51 is the set of vertices of the maximal abelian cover of @xmath0 .",
    "second , @xmath442 .",
    "third , via this isomorphism , the action of @xmath1 as deck transformations on vertices of the maximal abelian cover is equivalent to the action of @xmath54 by translations on @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the quotient @xmath431 is isomorphic to the set of vertices of @xmath0 .    to show that @xmath443 we use the work of bacher , de la harpe and nagnibeda on integral cuts @xcite . besides the already mentioned inner product on 1-chains , there is an inner product on 0-chains for which the vertices of @xmath0 form an orthonormal basis .",
    "this lets us define the adjoint @xmath444 concretely , for any vertex @xmath97 we have @xmath445 where we sum over all edges with target @xmath97 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that there is an orthogonal direct sum decomposition @xmath446 where @xmath447 is called the space of * * . inside the space of cuts",
    "there is a lattice @xmath448 called the lattice of * * .",
    "however , the decomposition of 1-chains into 1-cycles and cuts fails at the integral level : @xmath449 ths is the key to understanding the quotient @xmath432 .    since @xmath149 is an integral lattice , so are @xmath450 and @xmath54 .",
    "if we had @xmath451 then @xmath450 and @xmath54 would be self - dual , but in fact they are usually not . with the help of kirchhoff s spanning tree theorem , bacher , de la harpe and nagnibeda ( * ?",
    "2 ) prove that @xmath452 then they use a very general fact about lattices ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) to construct isomorphisms @xmath453 this implies @xmath454 but @xmath455 by lemma [ dual_lemma ] , so @xmath456 as desired , and thus @xmath457    the concept of ` cut ' has other applications to topological crystals . in the proof above",
    "we saw that for any vertex @xmath97 , @xmath445 is a cut , so it projects to zero in @xmath11 : @xmath458 multiplying by @xmath459 , we obtain @xmath460 where we sum over all edges with @xmath97 as source .",
    "for any atom @xmath461 arising from a path @xmath371 , the bonds coming out of this atom correspond to edges @xmath301 , and they connect it to atoms @xmath462 .",
    "the above equation thus says that the bonds coming out of any atom give vectors in @xmath11 summing to zero .",
    "this also follows from kotani and sunada s characterization of topological crystals in terms of energy minimization @xcite .",
    "if we think of the bonds as springs , all obeying hooke s law with the same spring constant , the total force on each atom must vanish in equilibrium , so the bonds must give vectors that sum to zero .",

    "second , when is @xmath19 actually a semidirect product of @xmath21 and @xmath1 ?",
    "the short exact sequence @xmath464 splits , making @xmath19 into a semidirect product , whenever every automorphism of @xmath0 fixes the basepoint @xmath115 .",
    "it does not split when @xmath0 is this graph :    so , the short exact sequence does not describe @xmath19 as a semidirect product in this case .",
    "the reason is that while @xmath21 is the symmetry group of a regular hexagon , this group does not act as symmetries fixing some atom in the corresponding crystal :          in this case @xmath21 is the symmetry group of a cube , and there is no way to get this group to act as symmetries of the diamond , so there is no way to express @xmath19 as a semidirect product of @xmath21 and @xmath1 .",
