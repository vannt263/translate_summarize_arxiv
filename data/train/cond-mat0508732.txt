    "almost a decade ago slonczewski@xcite and berger @xcite predicted that when a spin - polarized current is passed through a ferromagnet it transfers the transverse component of its spin angular momentum to the ferromagnet .",
    "the experimental verification of the theoretical predictions followed within a few years.@xcite since then , the so - called ` spin - transfer effect ' has been observed in a large number of different experiments .    in most experiments ,",
    "the spin - transfer torque is studied in a ferromagnet  normal - metal  ferromagnet tri - layer structure where a thick ferromagnet first polarizes the current which then exerts a spin - transfer torque on a second thinner ferromagnet . at",
    "sufficiently large applied current densities , the spin - transfer torque then may alter the magnetization direction of the thin magnet .",
    "the observation of hysteretic magnetic switching for one current direction only was seen as a hallmark of the spin - torque effect,@xcite and excluded an explanation of the experiments in terms of the faraday field associated with the applied current .",
    "( note that for small system sizes , the spin - transfer torque , which scales proportional to the current density , dominates over the torque exerted by the magnetic field caused by the current flow , which is proportional to the total current . )",
    "dynamical aspects of the magnetic switching process were addressed in recent experiments.@xcite    over the past few years there has been much theoretical interest in understanding the spin - transfer torque and its consequences for hybrid ferromagnet  normal - metal devices .",
    "the connection between spin currents or spin accumulation in the normal metal spacer layer and the spin torque can be considered understood@xcite ( see ref .   for a recent review ) .",
    "most calculations of the response of the magnetization to the spin - transfer torque have been done in the so - called ` macrospin approximation ' , assuming that the ferromagnets remain single domains during spin - transfer induced switching events.@xcite they have addressed the precise nature of the magnetic switching process , the possibility of limit cycles , and the temperature dependence of the spin - transfer torque .",
    "in addition , full micromagnetic simulations have been done by several groups,@xcite _",
    "e.g. _ , to examine the effect of the ampere field on the hysteretic switching or the breakdown of the macrospin model into quasi - chaotic dynamics at very high current densities .",
    "while the micromagnetic simulations are a significant improvement on the macrospin approximation when it comes accounting for spatial non - uniformities in the switching process , the existing simulations derive the spin - transfer torque from an externally fixed spin current , which is a poor description of the experimental geometries in which the spin currents are determined as an intricate combination of spin polarizations caused by all ferromagnetic elements in the device.@xcite    in a recent work , two of the authors showed that a sufficiently large but unpolarized electrical current flowing perpendicular to a _ single _",
    "thin ferromagnetic layer can excite spin waves in the ferromagnet.@xcite these spin waves have wavevector perpendicular to the direction of current flow .",
    "the key mechanism behind the transverse spin wave instability is electron diffusion in the normal - metal contacts perpendicular to the direction of current flow , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "electrons backscattered from the ferromagnet are spin polarized , the polarization direction being antiparallel to the direction of the magnetization at the location where they were reflected from the ferromagnet . when these electrons reach the ferromagnetic layer a second time , they typically do so at a different point at the normal - metal  ferromagnet interface . in the presence of a spin wave ,",
    "the magnetization direction of the ferromagnet will be different at that point , and these electrons will transfer the perpendicular component of their spin to the ferromagnet , thus exerting a spin - transfer torque .",
    "the sign of this torque is to enhance the spin - wave amplitude .",
    "a similar argument can be made for electrons transmitted through the ferromagnet , but their torques tend to suppress the spin - wave amplitude .",
    "typically , source and drain contacts are asymmetric , and a net spin - transfer torque is exerted on the ferromagnet .",
    "this torque leads to a spin wave instability for the current direction in which the effect of backscattered electrons dominates , and not for the other current direction .",
    "experiments on nanopillars a with single ferromagnetic layer have verified the theoretical predictions finding spin - wave instabilities for one direction of the current and for asymmetric junctions",
    "only.@xcite    = 0.7    for a quantitative theory of this transverse spin - wave instability , an approach that combines a full self - consistent determination of the spin - transfer torque and , at the same time , goes beyond the macrospin approximation is essential.@xcite indeed , the macrospin approximation does not allow for non - uniform spin waves in the ferromagnet , and , whereas an externally imposed spin transfer torque would predict a similar instability , a non - self - consistent theory would be quantitatively incorrect ( _ e.g. _ predict the wrong wavelength for the spin wave ) because it neglects the coupling between the spin current and the spin waves in the ferromagnet .",
    "the possibility of current - induced non - uniform modes in heterostructures has become of recent interest in the field , both for single - layer and multilayer structures.@xcite in particular , ji , chien , and stiles@xcite reported experimental and theoretical evidence that for large ferromagnet thickness , ferromagnet  normal - metal junctions are unstable to the generation of non - uniform magnetization modes , but in this case , these are longitudinal modes ( see also refs . and ) .",
    "further , stiles , xiao , and zangwill pointed out that transverse spinwaves can be excited even in symmetric junctions if the spinwave mode is at not uniform in the direction of current flow .",
    "however , excitation of these modes requires a higher currents than the transverse spin - waves considered here.@xcite    our previous work,@xcite as well as the other theoretical works on this and related spin - wave instabilities,@xcite was a linear stability analysis , sufficient to predict the onset of the instability , but not to describe the spin wave amplitude for current densities larger than the critical current density .",
    "knowledge of the spin wave amplitude is necessary if one wants to study , _",
    "e.g. , _ how the spin wave instability affects the resistance of the normal - metal  ferromagnet junction .",
    "it is the goal of this present work to examine in detail the dynamics of the spin - wave beyond the instability .",
    "while we focus on the case of single - layers , we expect that , in light of the work of refs .  , our qualitative findings will carry over to the case of tri - layers and heterojunctions .",
    "= 0.95    although a quantitative description of how the spinwave instability affects the resistance of the normal - metal  ferromagnet junction will be postponed to the next two two sections , the sign of the effect can be determined using simple considerations .",
    "once the current density has exceeded the critical current density for the spin wave excitation and a spin wave has been established , the fact that the magnetization is no longer uniform reduces the amount of spin accumulation in the normal metal contacts adjacent to the ferromagnet .",
    "a reduction of the spin accumulation in the normal metal contacts causes a reduction of the sample s resistance , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon2 ] for a schematic drawing .",
    "indeed , the experiments of ref .   observed a small decrease of the resistance of the nanopillar upon onset of the spin - wave instability .",
    "the effect of a purely transverse spinwave instability is opposite to that of a longitudinal spinwave , which increases the resistance of the device.@xcite the reduction of the spin accumulation in the normal - metal spacer also lowers the spin - transfer torque , thus providing a mechanism to saturate the growth of the spin wave amplitude for current densities larger than the critical current density .",
    "moreover , note that a theory of this effect needs to combine features of both the micromagnetic approach and the self - consistent treatment of the spin - transfer torque .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we consider current densities slightly above the critical current density . in this regime ,",
    "a perturbative treatment in the spin wave amplitude is possible . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we then perform a detailed numerical simulation of a simplified system that allows us to probe current densities much larger than the critical current density . whereas the observed magnetization dynamics in the presence of a large magnetic field is rather unsurprising",
    " there is one stable energy minimum , and the magnetization precesses around the direction for which energy is minimal  , in the absence of an external magnetic field we find a hierarchy of instabilities .",
    "for very high currents the system shows chaotic behavior with measurable lyapunov exponents .",
