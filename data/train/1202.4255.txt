    "it suffices to show that @xmath715 implies that there exists @xmath709 such that @xmath720 since this would imply that @xmath721 by the duality .",
    "first , we show the following @xmath722 to see this , assume that @xmath723 and @xmath724 for @xmath237 .",
    "if we take @xmath725 then @xmath726 for any real @xmath727 , but @xmath728 for sufficiently large @xmath727 , contradictory to @xmath715 .",
    "we note that @xmath729 which implies @xmath730 by ( [ ew - ass_1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath731 finally , we consider the case when @xmath732 .",
    "we note that @xmath733 for every @xmath725 , which implies @xmath734 by ( [ ew - ass_1 ] ) again . from this , we get @xmath735 for any @xmath725 . therefore , we may put @xmath736 to get ( [ ew - ass_2 ] ) .",
    "note that the statement ( ii ) is immediate from the statements ( i ) and ( iii ) . for the statement ( iii ) , suppose that @xmath737 .",
    "then there exist @xmath738 and @xmath739 such that @xmath740 which implies that @xmath741 since @xmath742 is not completely positive , we see that @xmath743 and @xmath744 .",
    "the converse is clear .",
    "an entanglement witness is said to be _ optimal _ if it detects a maximal set of entanglement . by proposition [ ewlemma ] ,",
    "it is easy to describe the notion of optimality in terms of faces .",
    "we denote by @xmath745 the smallest face of @xmath75 containing @xmath10 .",

    "this implies that @xmath750 , and so @xmath10 is not optimal .",
    "conversely , if @xmath10 is not optimal then there is @xmath751 such that @xmath750 .",
    "then there is @xmath709 and nonzero @xmath710 such that @xmath752 .",
    "since @xmath753 and @xmath745 is a face we see that @xmath746 .",
    "it is not so easy to determine if @xmath745 has a completely positive map or not , since we do not know the facial structures of the cone @xmath75 completely .",
    "but , it is easy to determine whether the bidual face @xmath754 , which is the smallest exposed face containing @xmath10 , has a completely positive map or not .",
    "it should be noted that the dual is taken in the dual pair @xmath224 .",
    "for example , @xmath755 is a face of @xmath176 .",
    "note that @xmath758 if and only if there exists a nonzero @xmath30 such that @xmath759 since every convex set in the boundary lies in a maximal face .",
    "note that the dual face @xmath760 is taken with respect to the dual pair @xmath761 .",
    "the condition @xmath759 is equivalent to the following @xmath762 by the relation ( [ per - relation ] ) , which is also equivalent to @xmath763 .",

    "it is now clear that there exists a nonzero @xmath30 satisfying ( [ ihfdftdft ] ) if and only if the set @xmath765 $ ] does not span the whole space , and this completes the proof .",
    "we say that @xmath177 has the _ spanning property _ if it satisfies the conditions in proposition [ spanning ] .",
    "therefore , if @xmath10 has the spanning property then @xmath10 is an optimal entanglement witness , as was seen in @xcite .",
    "note that the choi map @xmath74 $ ] does not have the spanning property by ( [ choi - span ] ) , as was observed in @xcite .",

    ", we consider the set @xmath769 of all ppt entanglement detected by @xmath10 : @xmath770 note that @xmath769 is nonempty if and only if @xmath10 is indecomposable by the duality between @xmath186 and @xmath183 . following theorem @xcite tells us that exposed indecomposable positive maps detect quite large set of ppt entanglement with a nonempty interior .",
    "recall that any entanglement is detected by an exposed positive linear map by proposition [ exposed - extreme ] .",
    "it should be noted that any dense subsets of the set of all exposed positive maps also detect all entanglement .      1 .",
    "@xmath10 has both the spanning and co - spanning properties .",
    "@xmath754 has no nonzero decomposable maps .",
    "the set @xmath769 has the nonempty relative interior in @xmath186 .",
    "the set @xmath769 contains a pptes @xmath3 such that both @xmath3 and @xmath155 have the full ranges .",
    "the implications ( i ) @xmath764 ( ii ) @xmath764 ( iii ) are consequences of propositions [ spanning ] and [ cospanning ] . for ( iii ) @xmath772 ( iv ) ,",
    "take @xmath773 which is also an interior point of the cone @xmath186 .",
    "if we take a line segment from @xmath774 , which is an interior point of @xmath186 , to the boundary point @xmath4 of @xmath186 through @xmath3 , then any point @xmath96 on this line segment between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is an interior point of @xmath186 .",
    "it is now clear that @xmath96 is a relative interior point of @xmath775 with respect to @xmath186 .",
    "the direction ( iv ) @xmath772 ( v ) is now clear .",
    "it remains to prove the implication ( v ) @xmath772 ( i ) .",
    "suppose that both @xmath776 and @xmath155 have the full ranges , and consider the line segment between @xmath3 and the identity matrix @xmath774 .",
    "since @xmath705 and @xmath777 , there is @xmath579 on the line segment such that @xmath778 .",
    "denote by @xmath100 and @xmath492 the orthogonal complements of the product vectors in @xmath765 $ ] and the partial conjugates of product vectors in @xmath765 $ ] , respectively .",
    "then @xmath482 is an exposed decomposition pair by theorem [ 1-simple - theorem ] , and so we see that @xmath579 belongs to the face @xmath779 of @xmath186 by theorem [ 3333 ] . since @xmath579 is an interior point of @xmath186 ,",
    "we conclude that both @xmath100 and @xmath492 are zeroes .",
    "if @xmath10 is exposed then @xmath754 is the ray generated by @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath10 is indecomposable then it is clear that @xmath754 has neither completely positive nor completely copositive maps .",
    "this shows that @xmath10 satisfies both the spanning and co - spanning properties by propositions [ spanning ] and [ cospanning ] .",
    "it is now clear that decomposable exposed maps do not satisfy the conditions in theorem [ exposed ] .",
    "now , we turn our attention to decomposable optimal witnesses .",
    "even though decomposable maps can not detect ppt entanglement , it is worth while to study those maps since they have a close relation to the facial structures of the cones @xmath183 and @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a decomposable map and denote by @xmath780 the smallest face of @xmath183 containing @xmath10 .",
    "note that the completely copositive linear map @xmath781 is completely positive if and only if @xmath246 is of rank one , and we have the relation @xmath782 in this case .",
    "therefore , if @xmath10 is an optimal decomposable entanglement witness then the face @xmath783 of @xmath183 must be of the form @xmath784 for a completely entangled subspace @xmath785 of @xmath261",
    ". in particular , @xmath10 must be completely copositive , and of the form @xmath786 since the relation @xmath787 holds in general , we see that @xmath780 is of the form @xmath788 for a subspace @xmath789 of @xmath785 .",
    "we also note that the map @xmath10 of the form ( [ cocom ] ) is an interior point of the convex set @xmath790 with @xmath791 by ( [ inte - face - ccp ] ) . since @xmath792 is a face of @xmath342",
    ", we conclude that @xmath793 , and @xmath794 in this case , we say that @xmath10 is _ supported _ on the space @xmath795 .",
    "especially , we see that @xmath492 must be completely entangled and the face @xmath796 of @xmath342 must be a face of the bigger cone @xmath183 , whenever @xmath10 in ( [ cocom ] ) is an optimal entanglement witness .",
    "it @xmath10 is an interior point of the convex cone @xmath75 then the face @xmath745 is the whole cone @xmath75 itself . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath10 is optimal then it must be on the boundary of the cone @xmath75",
    ". we may apply corollary [ boundary - positive ] to see that there exists a product vector @xmath766 such that @xmath410 .",
    "we note that @xmath797 by ( [ iuguiggih ] ) and ( [ per - relation ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have the following relation @xmath798 this shows that the product vector @xmath229 belongs to @xmath799 .",
    "we summarize as in the following theorem @xcite .",
    "note that the necessary condition ( i ) had been already known in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath10 is a completely copositive map supported on @xmath492 then we see by ( [ par - con - ccp ] ) that the set @xmath765 $ ] consists of the partial conjugates of product vectors in @xmath799 .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 has the spanning property if and only if the partial conjugates of product vectors in @xmath799 spans the whole space .",
    "when @xmath232 , it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath492 is completely entangled then the pair @xmath801 satisfies the range criterion . therefore , if @xmath232 then a completely copositive map is an optimal entanglement witness if and only if it has the spanning property if and only if its support is completely entangled . especially , condition ( i ) of theorem [ main- ] actually implies conditions ( ii ) and ( iii ) .    consider a @xmath680 ppt state @xmath3 with @xmath802 which is supported on a @xmath273-dimensional completely entangled subspace @xmath492 . since the @xmath803 matrix @xmath3 represents both a completely positive map and a completely copositive map ,",
    "this is a common interior point of the different convex subsets @xmath804 and @xmath796 of the cone @xmath183 , and so we conclude that @xmath796 is not a face of the cone @xmath183 .",
    "hence , any interior points of @xmath796 which are not completely positive give us examples of non - optimal entanglement witnesses supported on the completely entangled subspaces @xmath492 .    to get an explicit example , we begin with the matrix ( [ eq : xx ] ) with @xmath805 and @xmath806 , @xmath807 , which is just the pptes constructed in @xcite .",
    "this is the choi matrix of the map @xmath808 which is both completely positive and completely copositive .",
    "we also consider the completely copositive map @xmath809 which is clearly optimal .",
    "then every map @xmath810 on the open line segment between @xmath811 and @xmath742 is not optimal since @xmath811 is completely positive , although the support of @xmath812 with @xmath813 is completely entangled , whenever @xmath807 .",
    "see the recent papers @xcite and @xcite for more examples of ppt states which are symmetric under the partial transpose .    characterizing completely entangled subspace @xmath492 satisfying the condition ( iii ) of theorem [ main- ] may be the first step to understand the whole facial structures of the cone @xmath183 : how are the two convex cones @xmath169 and @xmath342 located each other to generate the whole convex cone @xmath183 ?",
    "the above mentioned result in @xcite implies that if @xmath232 and @xmath492 is completely entangled then the face @xmath796 of the cone @xmath342 is a face of @xmath183 which is exposed by separable states by theorem [ 1-simple - theorem ] .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath232 then @xmath796 is an exposed face of @xmath183 if and only if the set of all rank one matrices in @xmath492 forms a subspace together with the zero and @xmath799 is spanned by rank one matrices .",
    "completely entangled spaces are typical examples satisfying these conditions .",
    "recall that the maximum dimension of completely entangled subspaces of @xmath261 is given by @xmath814 . therefore , if @xmath232 or @xmath236 then the condition ( i ) of theorem [ main- ] actually implies the condition ( ii ) .",
    "in the case of @xmath815 and @xmath235 , the maximum dimension of completely entangled subspaces is @xmath816 .",
    "furthermore , generic @xmath639-dimensional subspaces of @xmath817 are completely entangled .",
    "therefore , it might be very reasonable to expect that there is a @xmath639-dimensional completely entangled subspace of @xmath817 whose orthogonal complement is also completely entangled .",
    "indeed , numerical results in @xcite indicate that this is the case .",
    "they produced @xmath818 ppt states whose images and kernels are @xmath639-dimensional completely entangled subspaces .",
    "explicit examples may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more generally , young - hoon kiem informed the author that if @xmath819 then @xmath820-dimensional subspaces of @xmath261 are generically completely entangled subspaces with the completely entangled orthogonal complements .",
    "it would be interesting to know if the converse of theorem [ main- ] holds or not . if we add to the three conditions in theorem [ main- ] one more condition that the two faces @xmath821 and @xmath822 coincide , then we see that @xmath823 is optimal . to find conditions under which the relation @xmath824 holds in the general situation seems to be an important step to understand in what way the cone @xmath183 sits down in the bigger cone @xmath75 .",

    "<S> in this expository note , we explain facial structures for the convex cones consisting of positive linear maps , completely positive linear maps , decomposable positive linear maps between matrix algebras , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these will be applied to study the notions of entangled edge states with positive partial transposes and optimality of entanglement witnesses .    </S>",
    "<S> 6.0 truemm 1.5 true pc        the notion of quantum entanglement has been one of the key research areas of quantum physics since the nineties , in relation with possible applications to quantum information and quantum computation theory . </S>",
    "<S> since the set of all separable states is a convex set , convex geometry may be one of the mathematical framework to study these notions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the convex duality between various cones in tensor product spaces and linear mapping spaces are very useful to characterize the various notions for entanglement , and has been used implicitly by physicists to detect entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the best way to understand the whole structures of a given convex set is to characterize the lattice of all faces . </S>",
    "<S> the duality plays a key role for this purpose , since it gives us a simple way to describe exposed faces among all faces . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that important notions like separability , schmidt numbers and positive partial transpose may be explained as the dual objects of various notions of positivity . </S>",
    "<S> so , we begin this note to introduce several notions of positivity of linear maps between matrix algebras including @xmath0-positivity , complete positivity , complete copositivity and decomposability . </S>",
    "<S> we will introduce the several notions of entanglement in terms of dual objects of these notions .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to characterize the facial structures for complete positivity with which it is also possible to describe faces for decomposable positive maps . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to determine the boundary structures for positive linear maps , although it is very difficult to know the whole facial structures for those .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the main theme in the theory of entanglement is to determine if a given state is separable or not . </S>",
    "<S> since every separable state is of positive partial transpose , it is important to understand the facial structures for ppt states . </S>",
    "<S> facial structures for decomposable positive linear maps will be used for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> another topic of this note is the notion of optimal entanglement witnesses , which will be also explained in terms of facial structures for positive maps . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the notion of spanning property will be explained in terms of faces , which seems to be new .    </S>",
    "<S> this note touches very small parts of the whole aspects of the theory of entanglement , which attracts recently many mathematician including functional analysts . </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for approaches using the theory of operator systems and operator spaces , and see @xcite , @xcite for measure theoretic approach , for examples .    </S>",
    "<S> this note is an outcome of the series of lectures given at ritsumeikan university in october , 2011 . </S>",
    "<S> he is very grateful to professor hiroyuki osaka for his warm hospitality during his stay there as well as stimulating discussion on the topics . </S>",
    "<S> he is also grateful to all audience , especially to professor jun tomiyama whose comments were very useful to prepare this note . </S>",
    "<S> special thanks are due to professor kyung hoon han for his various useful comments on the draft . </S>"
