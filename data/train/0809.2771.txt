    "single self - assembled semiconductor quantum dots , also known as artificial atoms , are one solid - state medium in order to implement quantum information .",
    "they are of particular interest since they can potentially serve dual roles , as a source of on - demand entangled photon pairs@xcite , and also for processing / storage where the spin of an electron / hole serves as the qubit .",
    "an important physical parameter for both these uses is the g factor . in certain cases large electron and hole g factors",
    "are desired , to maximize separation of spin states to reduce off - resonant laser coupling@xcite , and others where a zero exciton g factor is desired for b - field tunable polarization insensitive photodetection@xcite .",
    "the electron g factor is a crucial parameter for controlling nuclei coupling@xcite , and to for coherent spin rotations@xcite . in short , understanding the origin of the g factor and how to control it is necessary in order to utilize spin for quantum applications .    of the available quantum dot materials systems , inas / inp is particularly attractive for long - distance , fibre - based , photonic applications , since the bandgap can be tuned for photoemission in the 1.5  @xmath1 m range , where attenuation is at a minimum . because of the low strain mismatch , inhomogeneous broadening of the ground - state emission energy can be a significant problem with inas / inp quantum dot ensembles",
    "however , this problem along with that of random spatial nucleation can be addressed through the use of inp pyramidal nanotemplates @xcite .",
    "these structures , which allow one to control the quantum dot nucleation site and manipulate the quantum dot size and shape , are amenable to further processing in order to place control structures , such as photonic crystal microcavities or electrostatic gates , around individual dots . in terms of their impact on spin properties , inp pyramidal nanotemplates have been used to manipulate the g factor of inas dots ; with the pyramid apex being used to limit the quantum dot lateral dimension and allow manipulation of the g factor @xcite . in the work reported here , we study dots on pyramidal nanotemplates as well as dots on planar substrates and we show that the exciton g factor is sensitive not only to the lateral dimensions of the dot , but also to the quantum dot height . to study planar quantum dots , we isolate individual dots from a sample in which the ground - state emission of the dot ensemble spans a large energy range ( from 780  mev to 1100  mev ) . these dots are known to have a square - based , truncated pyramidal shape , with stepwise , single monolayer ( ml ) variations in height , as shown by the modal distribution of the ensemble photoluminescence @xcite .",
    "such a sample allows a parameterized study of the exciton g factor vs. quantum dot height ; with the height varying from approximately 3  ml to 10  ml .",
    "the exciton g factors of more than 20 single dots across this height range were measured and a strong dependence of the g factor on height was observed .",
    "we highlight two major features of the g factor tunability ; a large tuning span ( -2 to + 1.2 ) and a zero _ exciton _ g factor at an emission wavelength around 1300  nm.with the exception of truncated inas / gaas dots , grown by the indium - flush technique @xcite , many dot materials systems have shown no dependence of the g factor on quantum dot height @xcite .",
    "samples were grown by chemical - beam epitaxy on fe - doped inp semi - insulating substrates .",
    "for all growths , the oxide was removed at 530@xmath2c under phosphine overpressure .",
    "the growth temperature for the dots ranged from 495 - 530@xmath2c , which was monitored using the band - edge technique .",
    "single dots grown on planar substrates were isolated by etching sub - micron sized mesas .",
    "further details of the growth , sample processing , and zero magnetic field measurements can be found in previous reports @xcite .",
    "magneto - optic measurements were performed in faraday geometry using a split - coil superconducting magnet and free - space optics .",
    "samples were mounted on a cold - finger and held at 4.2k .",
    "an in - situ microscope objective with an na of 0.85 or a geltech lens with an na of 0.65 were used for hene laser excitation and for collection of the luminescence .",
    "polarization analysis was performed with a broadband achromatic quarter(half)-wave plate and a fixed glan - thompson polarizer to resolve circular ( linear ) polarizations .",
    "the magnet windows and optics were tested to ensure polarization fidelity across the large wavelength span .",
    "spectral resolution was approximately 80  @xmath1ev at 1550  nm , scaling to about 110  @xmath1ev at 1100  nm .",
    "the _ s_-shell exciton emission from single dots was identified from the brightest single emission line at minimum pumping intensity , a linear integrated intensity evolution with respect to pump power and from the evolution of clear _ p_-shell structure at higher energy with increasing pump intensities , as described previously @xcite .",
    "the linewidth of the _ s_-shell exciton emission for each of the dots reported here was resolution limited at zero magnetic field and each of the zeeman split peaks remained resolution limited as a function of increasing magnetic field .",
    "magnetic field dispersion plots of the _ s_-shell exciton were obtained in fields up to 7  t , in 1  t increments .",
    "representative magnetic field dispersion spectra for three dots are shown in fig .",

    "ideal , linear zeeman splitting and quadratic diamagnetic shifts ( not shown ) are observed . due to the small magnitude of the g factors",
    ", zeeman splitting could not be resolved below 2 - 3 t in most cases .",
    "once zeeman splitting was resolved , right and left circularly polarized emission was observed .",
    "the g factor was determined from a linear fit to the following expression :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energies of the right and left circularly polarized emission peaks respectively and @xmath6 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the line of best fit was extrapolated back to zero splitting ; no anisotropic exchange splitting was resolved or assumed in the dots studied here within the spectral resolution available .",

    "[ gfactor ] , the green lines represent an 80% confidence band for the g factor . all dots emitting below 1000  mev fall within this band .",

    "the exciton g factor deviates from its linear behavior and confinement effects appear to saturate .",
    "to understand the origin of the dependence of the exciton g factor on quantum dot emission energy , _ _",

    "fig [ calc ] shows the calculated electron and hole g factors for inas@xmath11p@xmath12 dots of varying height and constant diameter .",
    "the calculations predict zero exciton g factor at approximately 875  mev ; somewhat lower than the experimentally observed crossover point around 925  mev .",
    "importantly , the trend of increasing g factor with increasing transition energy and eventual saturation agrees qualitatively with the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "[ gfactor ] .",
    "the slope of g factor vs. _ s_-shell energy is substantially higher in calculation than observed in practice .",
    "the difference between experiment and theory may be explained by the fact that the calculations do not account for variations in quantum dot diameter , phosphorous incorporation and geometry .",
    "however , the calculations show that the hole g factor is more sensitive to confinement effects than the electron g factor and it is this sensitivity of the hole g factor that drives the sign inversion of the exciton g factor . other calculations @xcite confirm that the electron g factor does not change appreciably over the dot size range discussed here .    in quantum dots , the sensitivity of the hole g factor to the height of structures is due to not only the mixture of heavy and light hole components but also the nonzero envelope orbital momenta ( neom ) @xcite in the hole states . generally , the hole g factor has contributions from both the bloch and envelope parts ,    @xmath13    [ gfactorblochenvelope ] the one from the bloch part , @xmath14 , mainly consists of contributions from the heavy and light hole components , which strongly depends on the degree of the mixture of heavy and light hole components in the hole states . as this band mixing effect",
    "is usually enhanced with the increasing height of the structure , @xmath15 is seen to become larger in a higher dot . besides the band mixing effect , the variation in the height of quantum dots causes another change in the hole states , i.e. , neom . in the thin",
    "dot , the ground hole state is dominated by its heavy - hole component with almost zero neom . in spite that the light - hole component has neom of about 1 , its contribution to the hole g factor is negligible due to its small proportion in the hole states .",
    "as the dot becomes thicker , the neom of the dominating heavy - hole component gradually increases and give rise to larger contribution to @xmath16 .",
    "compared to the mixture of heavy and light hole components , this effect is more important and essential to understand the behavior of the hole g factor as the geometry of the dot varies .",
    "for inas / inp dots , the experimentally observed variation of the exciton g factor suggests there is significant lh / hh mixing for dots emitting below 1000  mev . for the shorter dots ,",
    "the contribution from light - holes saturates and changes in confinement , as well as possible wavefunction leakage into the barrier material , no longer have a significant impact on the hole g factor .",
    "this same mechanism may not operate in inas / gaas dots , explaining any lack of g factor height dependence , if the size regime were such that contributions from the light - hole band were minimal . for inas / inp dots , in the region where band mixing plays a role , the exciton g factor changes by approximately 0.4 per monolayer of added height .",
    "changing the diameter would also influence @xmath15 , since the spatial extent of the heavy - hole wavefunction is sensitive to the dot diameter . in the following section",
    "we demonstrate that the the aspect ratio of the dot can considerably changed . in short ,",
    "@xmath16 is dominated by the height of the dot and @xmath14 is affected by both height and diameter .",

    "in addition to gross tuning of the g factor through choice of quantum dot height , and therefore emission energy , it would be desirable to be able to tune the exciton g factor through control of the quantum dot lateral dimension .",
    "this lateral size control can be achieved by using inp pyramidal nanotemplates to dictate the quantum dot nucleation dynamics . in this technique",
    ", an inas dot is nucleated at the ( 001 ) apex of a square - based inp pyramid .",
    "the inp pyramid is grown _ in situ _ by selective - area - epitaxy , in a location that is defined by submicron , square windows in an sio@xmath17 overlayer deposited on the inp substrate . during inp growth",
    ", the dimension of the ( 001 ) top surface of the pyramid reduces from purely geometric considerations ( 45@xmath2 facets ) .",
    "when the apex approaches the dimension of a quantum dot , inp growth is terminated and inas is deposited .",
    "images from an uncapped sample are shown in fig [ semtop ] .",
    "the dimension of the ( 001 ) apex on which the dot nucleates is determined primarily by the size of the initial sio@xmath17 window and the quantity of inp delivered . as",
    "the amount of delivered inp is extremely precise , the precision with which one can predict the size of the pyramid apex is determined by the precision with which one knows the base width .",
    "further details of this process can be found in previous reports @xcite and references therein .",
    "for the optical experiments reported here , the inas dot is capped with inp once nucleated .    to demonstrate that the pyramidal templates can be used to influence the quantum dot g factor",

    "shows a g factor that is 0.6 below that expected for a planar dot emitting at the same energy .    to understand the influence of the template on quantum dot g factor , one must consider the aspect ratio of the dot ; the ratio between quantum dot height and width .",
    "for planar dots , this ratio is approximately 15 as observed in transmission electron microscopy images @xcite ; with dots nucleating 15 times wider than they are high . for dots nucleated at the apex of pyramidal nanotemplates , the linear relationship between quantum dot height and width is relaxed , since dots tend to  wet \" the area available to them on the ( 001 ) pyramid apex , conforming to the shape of the top surface of the truncated pyramid .",
    "this behavior can be seen in the scanning electron micrograph images of uncapped samples in fig [ semtop ] . for these samples",
    ", precautions were taken to ensure that the uncapped samples were representative of the conditions at the time when dot nucleation was completed : a rapid cool down under low arsine overpressure was used to avoid etching of the inp sidewalls and to `` freeze in '' the geometry at the time of quantum dot nucleation .",
    "fig [ semtop](b ) shows that the dot lateral size can be controlled across a substantial range .",
    "homogenous formations of inas with widths as large as 75  nm and as small as 10  nm were observed , whilst for widths above 75  nm , multiple dots begin to form .",

    "[ semtop](c ) for growth at 530@xmath2c , showing how selection of the appropriate base width can be used to determine the size of the pyramid apex and therefore the quantum dot width .",
    "fine tuning of the dot size is limited primarily by e - beam lithography . by controlling the amount of inas supplied and the pyramid base width ,",
    "the aspect ratio of the dot can be varied , offering aspect ratios that can not be obtained with planar , stranski - krastanov growth .        to extract information about the quantum dot diameter",

    "seem to be present , as shown by the red and green points , with the diamagnetic coefficient of both species increasing linearly with decreasing s - shell emission energy , as one would expect for a constant aspect ratio of the dot .",
    "we suggest that the linearly varying behavior with higher diamagnetic coefficient corresponds to the presence of charged excitons in some dots @xcite , producing a different diamagnetic coefficient but an identical g factor @xcite . for the quantum dots nucleated on pyramidal templates ,",
    "the scatter in the diamagnetic coefficient is much larger , confirming that aspect ratios can be obtained that are not found in planar dots .",
    "table [ sum1 ] summarizes the pyramid base size , diamagnetic coefficient and exciton g factors for these dots .",
    "the six dots are from four separate growths .",
    "precise comparison can be made between dots grown on the same substrate because of the high correlation between base dimension and top mesa size ( because all pyramidal templates on the same substrate are supplied with identical amounts of inp ) , but templates with the same base dimension can have different top dimensions in successive growths , if differing quantities of inp are supplied .",
    "for the three dots ( 1a , 1b , 2a ) , emitting with almost identical energies around 790 - 800  mev , the diamagnetic coefficients range from 5 - 21.1 , producing the spread of g factors seen in fig .",
    "[ gfactor ] .",
    "nanotemplate dots with a g factor above ( below ) the prediction band have diameters that are smaller ( larger ) than the typical planar dot emitting at the same energy . for dot 4 , although the base dimensions are relatively small , less inp was deposited during growth , producing a fairly large pyramid apex .",
    "the diamagnetic coefficient for this dot corresponds to a quantum dot diameter that is considerably larger than the average diameter for a planar dot emitting at this energy and consequently produces a significantly lower g factor .",
    "the diamagnetic coefficients of the dots agree with the estimated top diameter of the mesa which is calculated as in fig [ semtop]c .",
