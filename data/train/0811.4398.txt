    "it is common knowledge that the lifshitz theory gives a description of the van der waals and casimir forces between two plane parallel plates ( semispaces ) in terms of the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities of the plate materials @xmath0 [ 13 ] . starting in 2000 , problems and paradoxes with the application of the lifshitz theory to real materials ( at first to metals [ 4 ] and then to dielectrics [ 5 ] )",
    "were recognized .",
    "specifically , for metals described by the drude dielectric function a large thermal effect was predicted at short separations [ 4 ] in qualitative disagreement with the case of ideal metals .",
    "this prediction was excluded experimentally at a 99.9% confidence level [ 6,7 ] . at large separations , for the drude metals one half of the casimir force acting between ideal metals was obtained [ 4 ] .",
    "the same result was obtained in [ 8,9 ] by modelling a metal with a set of nonrelativistic hard - core or point - like particles confined by walls . in [ 10 ]",
    "it was shown that the substitution of the drude dielectric function into the lifshitz formulas results in a violation of the third law of thermodynamics for metals with perfect crystal lattices . in",
    "[ 11 ] it was demonstrated that for metals with impurities the nernst heat theorem is satisfied .",
    "this , however , does not solve the problem because in accordance with quantum statistical physics the nernst theorem must be satisfied for metals with perfect crystal lattices as well .",
    "the situation is even more dramatic for dielectrics , the materials for which the lifshitz theory was originally formulated .",
    "it was shown that the inclusion of the dc conductivity arising in all dielectrics at nonzero temperature radically changes the theoretical predictions and leads to disagreement between the lifshitz theory and thermodynamics [ 5,12,13 ] .    in this paper",
    "we review recent paradoxial applications of the lifshitz theory to real materials ( mostly to dielectrics ) and analyze the physical reasons of why the paradoxes appear .",
    "we show that difficulties arise each time when the drift or diffusion currents are included in the model of the dielectric response . in this connection",
    "we discuss recent experiments with semiconductors [ 14,15 ] and dielectric [ 16 ] test bodies and show that the measurement results are in disagreement with theory taking the dc conductivity into account .",
    "recent theoretical approaches attempting to solve problems of the lifshitz theory by accounting for screening effects and diffusion currents [ 17,18 ] are demonstrated to be in contradiction with both thermodynamic and experimental data .",
    "our analysis leads to the conclusion that the roots of the problems are in the violation of the applicability conditions of the lifshitz theory when the role of free charge carriers is included in the model of the dielectric response .",

    "rapid progress in the measurements of the casimir force is very helpful for the resolution of the theoretical controversies .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the experiment [ 6,7 ] excluded the use of the drude model to describe the thermal casimir force between metal plates .",
    "it is important to note , however , that a much smaller thermal effect , as predicted by the generalized plasma model [ 24,25 ] , was not registered in that experiment .",
    "here we consider the results of two other experiments involving semiconductor and dielectric materials [ 1416 ] .",
    "both of them are accurate enough to resolve between the theoretical approaches including and neglecting the dielectric dc conductivity .",
    "what is more , one of them [ 16 ] provides the first experimental observation of the thermal effects in casimir physics .",
    "we start with the observation of modulation of the casimir force between a gold coated sphere and a si plate with laser light [ 14,15 ] . in this experiment ,",
    "a b doped @xmath43-type si plate was illuminated with laser pulses and the difference of the casimir forces between a sphere and a plate in the presence and in the absence of light has been measured . in the absence of laser pulse",
    "the concentration of charge carriers in the si plate was @xmath44 and in the presence of light @xmath45 or @xmath46 for the two different absorbed powers @xmath47mw and @xmath48mw .",
    "the directly measured quantity was , thus , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the casimir forces in the presence and in the absence of laser light on the plate , respectively .",
    "the experimental data were compared with the lifshitz theory either neglecting or including dc conductivity of the high - resistivity si in the dark phase .    in fig .",
    "1(a , b ) the mean experimental data @xmath52 are shown as dots for the absorbed powers @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the calculational results for @xmath55 , using the lifshitz theory with neglect of the dc conductivity of the high - resistivity si ( dark phase ) , are shown as the solid lines .",
    "similar calculational results using the lifshitz theory with included dc conductivity ( [ eq11 ] ) in the dark phase are shown as the long - dashed lines . as is seen in fig .",
    "1(a , b ) the solid lines are consistent with the data whereas the long - dashed lines are excluded over the wide separation region . in the same figure , the short - dashed lines show the computational results obtained from the lifshitz formula at zero temperature . as is seen in the figure ,",
    "the computational results at @xmath56 are consistent with the data .",
    "these results do not depend on whether the dc conductivity was included or neglected .",
    "the experiment under consideration is precise enough to exclude the large thermal effect , as obtained when the dc conductivity in the dark phase is included , but is not of sufficient precision to measure the small thermal effect obtained in the case when the dc conductivity in the dark phase is neglected .",

    "note that these errors are entirely experimental .",

    "the theoretical force differences @xmath58 computed at @xmath59k with neglected and included dc conductivity in the dark phase are shown as the solid and dashed lines , respectively . from fig .  2",
    "one concludes that inclusion of the dc conductivity in the dark phase is excluded by the experimental data at a 95% confidence level within the separation region from 100 to 150 nm .",
    "note that computations of the casimir force between an au coated sphere and si plate were done using the proximity force approximation [ 26 ] @xmath60 where @xmath38 is given by ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the dielectric permittivities @xmath61 and @xmath62 for si and au , respectively , were obtained from the tabulated optical data [ 23 ] by means of the kramers - kronig relations .",
    "practically the same results can be obtained using the analytical representations for @xmath63 . for au high precision six - oscillator model",
    "is considered in [ 7 ] . for si",
    ", the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity can be modeled as a constant within some frequency region [ 27 ] @xmath64 where @xmath65ev , @xmath66ev , @xmath67 . using the kramers - kronig relation , this results in @xmath68",
    "the use of the approximation ( [ eq16 ] ) instead of the tabulated optical data [ 23 ] leads to less than 1% deviations in the casimir force ( [ eq14 ] ) between an au sphere and si plate . at separations @xmath69 , 100 , 200 , 400 and 600 nm",
    "this deviation is equal to @xmath70% , 0.30% , 0.70% , 0.84% and 0.86% , respectively .",
    "another analytic formula representing the dielectric permittivity of si along the imaginary frequency axis takes the form [ 28 ] @xmath71\\omega_0 ^ 2}{\\omega_0 ^ 2+\\xi^2 } , \\label{eq17}\\ ] ] where @xmath72rad / s , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this representation also leads to less than 1% differences in the case of au sphere above si plate in comparison to computations using the tabulated optical data for si .",
    "thus , at separations @xmath69 , 100 , 200 , 400 and 600 nm the relative deviations between both computations are equal to 0.75% , 0.74% , 0.62% , 0.55% and 0.52% .",
    "because of this , both the tabulated optical data for si and different analytical representations for its dielectric permittivity can be used in the computations within 1% precision .",
    "another important experimental test is the measurement of the thermal casimir - polder force through center - of - mass oscillations of the trapped bose - einstein condensate [ 16 ] . in this experiment , not only were different models of the dielectric response compared with the data [ 16,29 ] , but the thermal effect was measured for the first time in casimir physics .",
    "the condensate of rb atoms was at a distance from 7 to @xmath75 m from a fused sio@xmath76 dielectric substrate . in the original publication",
    "this substrate was considered as a dielectric material with the static dielectric permittivity @xmath77 .",
    "however , at room temperature ( in an equilibrium situation the temperature of the substrate and environment were equal to @xmath78k ) sio@xmath76 has nonzero conductivity which is ionic in nature and varies from @xmath79 to @xmath80 depending on the concentration of alkali ions which are always present as trace constituents [ 30,31 ] .",
    "this conductivity was taken into account in [ 29 ] in accordance with ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "the directly measured quantity in the experiment [ 16 ] was the relative shift of the frequency of center - of - mass oscillations of the bose - einstein condensate due to the presence of the casimir - polder force @xmath81 here , @xmath82 kg is the mass of the rb atom , @xmath83 is the unperturbed trap frequency @xmath84rad / s , @xmath85 in the equilibrium situation is given by the negative derivative of @xmath86 defined in ( [ eq3 ] ) with respect to @xmath5 , and the averaging is done over the period of condensate oscillations and over the volume of the condensate cloud .",
    "k computed by neglecting ( solid line ) and including ( dashed line ) the conductivity of the dielectric substrate .",
    "the experimental data are shown as crosses . ]",
    "the experimental data for the relative frequency shift @xmath87 are presented as crosses in fig .",
    "the arms of the crosses show the total experimental errors determined in [ 16 ] at a 67% confidence level individually for each data point .",
    "the results of theoretical computations using ( [ eq18 ] ) with neglected dc conductivity of sio@xmath76 substrate are shown by the solid line [ 16,29 ] . as is seen in the figure , theory neglecting the dc conductivity of fused silica",
    "is in a very good agreement with the data . in the same figure ,",
    "the results of theoretical computations by ( [ eq18 ] ) with dc conductivity of sio@xmath76 included are shown by the dashed line [ 29 ] . as is seen in the figure ,",
    "the dashed line is in evident disagreement with the first two experimental points .",
    "the experiment was repeated for two more times in situations out of thermal equilibrium ( @xmath88k , @xmath89k and @xmath90k , @xmath89k ) , i.e. , with the temperature of the plate higher than the environment temperature . in this case",
    "the casimir - polder force @xmath85 in ( [ eq18 ] ) should be replaced with @xmath91 where the explicit form of the function @xmath92 can be found in [ 16,29,32 ] .",
    "k , @xmath89k and ( b ) @xmath90k , @xmath89k .",
    "computations are done by neglecting ( solid line ) and including ( dashed line ) the conductivity of the dielectric substrate .",

    "4 the experimental data for @xmath87 are shown for ( a ) @xmath88k and ( b ) @xmath90k as crosses with their arms indicating the experimental errors . as in fig .  3 ,",
    "the theoretical results computed with the dc conductivity of sio@xmath76 plate neglected and included are shown by the solid and dashed lines , respectively . as is seen in fig .",
    "4(a ) , the dashed line is in disagreement with the three experimental points , and the other two only touch it . in fig .",
    "4(b ) all data points exclude the theoretical approach represented by the dashed line .",
    "thus , the inclusion of the dc conductivity of the dielectric substrate into the lifshitz theory leads to disagreement with the experimental data .",
    "the calculational results using the lifshitz theory with the dc conductivity neglected are in very good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we emphasize that the theoretical results obtained with dc conductivity included do not depend on the value of conductivity , but only of the fact that it is nonzero .",
    "importantly , the inclusion of conductivity does not influence the nonequilibrium contributions to @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the puzzling effect comes only from the contribution to @xmath87 given by the lifshitz theory .",
    "in the above , both theoretical and experimental problems are elucidated arising in the lifshitz theory when applied to dielectric materials at nonzero temperature with dc conductivitincludedy . recently",
    ", these problems were discussed also in [ 33 ] but no solution was found . in [ 33 ]",
    "only `` weakly conducting '' materials were considered which possess nonzero conductivity at zero temperature .",
    "these are in fact metallic - type semiconductors with a dopant concentration above critical . to satisfy the nernst heat theorem ,",
    "it was suggested that there is nonzero residual relaxation at @xmath56 , i.e. , the crystal lattice is not perfect .",
    "materials of such type have nothing to do with dielectrics whose conductivity vanishes when temperature goes to zero .",
    "the formalism of [ 33 ] is also in contradiction with precision experiments dealing with metallic test bodies [ 6,7 ] .    to avoid contradictions of the lifshitz theory with the principles of thermodynamics and experimental results",
    ", one can propose the following phenomenological prescription . in the applications of the lifshitz theory to all materials having zero conductivity at zero temperature , the presence of free charge carriers at nonzero temperature should be disregarded .",
    "the dielectric permittivity of such materials should be described by equation ( [ eq4 ] ) . in the applications of the lifshitz theory to all materials having nonzero conductivity at zero temperature , free charge carriers should be included in the framework of the generalized plasma - like model @xmath93 where all @xmath17 .",
    "this prescription is consistent with thermodynamics and all available experimental data [ 22,24,25,34 ] .",
    "the physical reasons of why the lifshitz theory does not allow the inclusion of real conductivity processes can be understood as follows .",
    "lifshitz derived his famous formulas under the condition of thermal equilibrium .",
    "this means that not only @xmath94 , but also all irreversible processes connected with the dissipation of energy into heat have already been terminated [ 35,36 ] .",
    "the drude - like dielectric function ( [ eq11 ] ) is derived from the maxwell equations with a real drift current of conduction electrons @xmath95 initiated by the external electric field @xmath96 [ 24 ] . the drift current is an irreversible process which takes a system out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "this current leads to joule heating of the casimir plates ( ohmic losses ) [ 37 ] . to preserve the temperature constant",
    ", one should admit that there exists an unidirectional flux of heat from the medium to the heat reservoir [ 38 ] .",
    "such interactions between a system and a heat reservoir are prohibited by the definition of thermal equilibrium [ 39 ] .",
    "one can conclude that the substitution of the drude - like dielectric permittivities into the lifshitz formulas violate the applicability conditions under which this theory was developed .",
    "then it is not surprising that such substitution results in problems with thermodynamics and contradictions with experimental data . from this point of view , the lifshitz theory is free of problems and paradoxes which arise only if it is applied incorrectly .",
    "another question to be answered is the following .",
    "one could agree with the fact that the conductivity processes in real materials connected with the drift current of conduction electrons violate the applicability conditions of the lifshitz theory and , thus , are not described by this theory .",
    "these processes , however , exist in reality . because of this",
    "should they be taken into account in some future general theory of dispersion forces ? at the moment",
    "we have no answer to this question .",
    "all computations on the basis of the lifshitz theory for dielectrics with dc conductivity neglected and for metals by using the plasma - like dielectric permittivity ( [ eq20 ] ) are in agreement with both thermodynamics and experimental data .",
    "this suggests that the conductivity properties are not related to dispersion forces .",
    "more precise experiments will probably bring additional information to bear on this subject .",
    "recently it was proposed [ 17,18 ] that the problems of the lifshitz theory described above may have an alternative solution if the screening effects due to free charge carriers are taken into account .",
    "this approach includes both the drift and diffusion currents of free charge carriers through use of the transport boltzmann equation [ 18 ] .",
    "it uses the standard lifshitz formulas ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) for the free energy of wall - wall and atom - wall interaction with the te reflection coefficient , @xmath97 , as defined in ( [ eq2 ] ) within the drude model approach , but with the modified tm reflection coefficient @xmath98 here , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the permittivity of the bound core electrons given in ( [ eq4 ] ) . the quantity @xmath101 is defined as @xmath102^{1/2 } , \\label{eq23}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the screening length .",
    "if the charge carriers of density @xmath104 are described by the classical maxwell - boltzmann statistics , as assumed in [ 18 ] , one gets the debye - hckel screening length [ 40,41 ] @xmath105 assuming fermi - dirac statistics , one arrives at the thomas - fermi screening length [ 40,41 ] @xmath106 here , @xmath107 is the electron charge , @xmath108 is the dielectric constant due to the core electrons , and @xmath109 is the fermi energy .",
    "note that the paper [ 18 ] applies this approach to intrinsic semiconductor media .",
    "bearing in mind , however , that the classical drude dielectric permittivity is exploited , it is justified to apply it for metals and doped semiconductors ( both dielectric and metallic type ) as well , by substituting the respective screening length defined by ( [ eq24 ] ) or ( [ eq24a ] ) .",
    "now we consider whether or not the approach taking the screening effects into account is consistent with thermodynamics .",
    "we concentrate our attention on the case of dielectric materials whose conductivity goes to zero when the temperature vanishes . we start from the case of two similar dielectric semispaces [ @xmath110",

    "first we introduce the small parameter ( @xmath113 ) @xmath114 which goes to zero due to ( [ eq10 ] ) when the temperature vanishes .",

    "they lead to the asymptotic behavior of the casimir free energy per unit area given in ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "the dimensionless variables @xmath119 and @xmath120 are connected with other dimensional ones by the equations @xmath121 where @xmath122 is defined in ( [ eq2a ] ) .      the behavior of the first two terms in the curly brackets on the right - hand side of ( [ eq29 ] ) when @xmath2 goes to zero is more involved .",
    "if @xmath129 exponentially decays to zero with vanishing temperature ( as is true for pure insulators and intrinsic semiconductors ) , then according to ( [ eq24 ] ) so does @xmath126 . as a result , @xmath130 and",
    "the first two terms in the curly brackets cancel .",
    "then the casimir entropy @xmath131 goes to zero when @xmath2 vanishes following the same law as @xmath128 , i.e. , as @xmath132 .",
    "this means that for insulators and intrinsic semiconductors the formalism under consideration is in agreement with the nernst heat theorem .",
    "however , there is a wide class of dielectric materials ( such as doped semiconductors with dopant concentration below critical and solids with ionic conductivity ) for which @xmath104 does not go to zero when @xmath2 goes to zero .",
    "in fact , conductivity can be presented as [ 41 ] @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the mobility of charge carriers .",
    "although @xmath32 goes to zero exponentially fast for all dielectrics when @xmath2 goes to zero , for most of them this happens due to the vanishing mobility .",
    "for instance , as mentioned in sec .  3 ,",
    "the conductivity of sio@xmath76 used as the plate material in the experiment [ 16 ] is ionic in nature and is determined by the concentration of impuritues . for all such materials , in accordance with ( [ eq24 ] ) , @xmath135 when @xmath41 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath136 when @xmath2 goes to zero in accordance with ( [ eq28 ] ) . in this case",
    "we obtain from ( [ eq29 ] ) @xmath137>0 \\label{eq31}\\ ] ] in violation of the nernst heat theorem .",
    "this means that for a wide class of dielectric materials the proposed approach taking the screening effects into account is thermodynamically inconsistent in the same way as the standard lifshitz theory with the dc conductivity included [ compare with ( [ eq13 ] ) ] .",
    "we emphasize that the existence of dielectric materials for which @xmath104 does not go to zero but @xmath134 does go to zero when @xmath2 vanishes demonstrates that the reflection coefficient ( [ eq21 ] ) at @xmath138 is ambiguous .",
    "in reality , for such materials @xmath139 when @xmath2 and @xmath134 simultaneously vanish . this is because @xmath135 when @xmath41 in disagreement with physical intuition that there should be no screening at zero mobility .",
    "this ambiguity is connected with the break of continuity of the reflection coefficient @xmath140 at the point @xmath138 , @xmath56 .",

    "as was noted in [ 42 ] on general grounds , the violation of the nernst heat theorem is caused by the breaks in the continuity of the reflection coefficients at the origin of the @xmath144-plane .",
    "the theoretical approach taking the screening effects into account can also be applied to describe the casimir - polder atom - wall interaction . in this case",

    ", @xmath151 goes to zero as @xmath152 and the nernst theorem is satisfied . on the contrary , for all dielectric materials with nonvanishing @xmath104 we get @xmath136",
    "when @xmath41 and in this case ( [ eq33 ] ) results in @xmath153 this means that the nernst theorem is violated in the same way as in ( [ eq13 ] ) for the standard lifshitz theory with the dc conductivity included .",
    ", respectively . ]",
    "the theoretical predictions following from the approach proposed in [ 18 ] can be compared with the measurement data of the experiment on the modulation of the casimir force with light ( see sec .  3 for details ) .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) we present the experimental data of this experiment obtained for the absorbed powers @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , with the experimental errors of force measurements determined at 70% confidence level .",
    "the theoretical difference casimir force , computed using the standard lifshitz theory with the dc conductivity of high - resistivity si in the dark phase neglected , is shown by the solid lines .",
    "the theoretical difference casimir force computed by including the screening effects at all matsubara frequencies , as described above , is shown by the dashed lines .",
    "it can be seen that the standard lifshitz theory is consistent with data , whereas the theoretical approach taking the screening effects into account is excluded by the data at a 70% confidence level .    in sec .",
    "4 the contradictions with thermodynamics and the experimental data of the standard lifshitz theory with the dc conductivity included are explained based on the violation of its applicability condition , i.e. , of thermal equilibrium , in the presence of drift current . in a similar way",
    ", the approach taking the screening effects into account applies the lifshitz theory to physical phenomena involving both the drift and diffusion currents .",
    "the latter is caused by the nonequilibrium distribution of charge carriers in an external field , i.e. , by a physical situation out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "this is because the diffusion current is determined by a nonzero gradient of charge carrier density , whereas for homogeneous systems in thermal equilibrium the charge carrier density must be homogeneous .",
    "thus , the problems and paradoxes arising in this case are also explained by the use of the lifshitz theory outside of its defined application region .",
    "an earlier attempt to incorporate the screening effects in the theory of dispersion forces was undertaken in [ 17 ] . in this approach",
    "the effect of screening was taken into account only for the static field in the interaction of an atom with a dielectric wall .",
    "bearing in mind that in accordance with ( [ eq3 ] ) the te reflection coefficient at zero frequency does not contribute to the result , the single modified coefficient was [ 17 ] @xmath154 where @xmath126 is given in ( [ eq24 ] ) .",
    "it is easily seen that ( [ eq35 ] ) coincides with the general tm reflection coefficient @xmath140 defined in ( [ eq21 ] ) if one puts @xmath138 .",
    "the reflection coefficient ( [ eq35 ] ) can be obtained by the formal replacement of the dielectric permittivities depending only on the frequency with the permittivities depending both on frequency and the wave vector in the fresnel reflection coefficient of an uniaxial crystal . to confirm that this is the case",
    ", one should introduce nonisotropic permittivities @xmath155 and replace the coefficients @xmath156 and @xmath157 in ( [ eq2 ] ) with @xmath158 here , @xmath159 and @xmath160 are defined by ( [ eq2a ] ) with the replacement of @xmath100 by @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively . for @xmath163 and @xmath164 depending only on the frequency , ( [ eq36 ] ) is commonly used for the description of uniaxial crystals ( see , e.g. , [ 43,44 ] ) .",
    "then ( [ eq35 ] ) follows from ( [ eq36 ] ) if one puts @xmath165 where now @xmath166 depends on the wave vector , i.e. , spatial dispersion is present .",
    "thus , to obtain ( [ eq35 ] ) one substitutes into the fresnel reflection coefficient ( [ eq36 ] ) derived from the standard continuity boundary conditions a dielectric permittivity depending on the wave vector ( see [ 45,46 ] why this is inappropriate ) .",
    "we emphasize that the general reflection coefficients taking the screening effects into account [ the transverse electric from ( [ eq2 ] ) with the dielectric permittivity ( [ eq22 ] ) and the transverse magnetic from ( [ eq21 ] ) ] can not be represented in the form of ( [ eq36 ] ) . to prove this statement",
    ", we note that from the equality @xmath167 it follows that @xmath168 .",
    "thus , in accordance with ( [ eq22 ] ) , @xmath169 when @xmath143 . keeping in mind that @xmath170 , from ( [ eq36 ] ) one obtains @xmath171 .",
    "this is in contradiction with the above result that at zero frequency the reflection coefficient ( [ eq21 ] ) coincides with the reflection coefficient ( [ eq35 ] ) .",
    "this means that the general approach taking the screening effects into account [ 18 ] can not be described in terms of any dielectric permittivity which includes spatial dispersion .",
    "the approach based on the modification of only one reflection coefficient ( [ eq35 ] ) meets the same thermodynamical difficulties as the general approach considered above .",
    "thus , if one computes the casimir entropy with the reflection coefficient ( [ eq35 ] ) and all the other standard ones , as given by ( [ eq2 ] ) , it goes to zero when the temperature vanishes for dielectrics with exponentially vanishing charge carrier density @xmath104 .",
    "however , for dielectrics with nonvanishing @xmath104 the result ( [ eq34 ] ) is reproduced , i.e. , the nernst heat theorem is violated [ 20 ] .",
    "the modification of the tm reflection coefficient in accordance with ( [ eq35 ] ) can be verified experimentally by using the measurement data of the optical modulation experiment discussed in sec .",
    "3 . in theoretical computations at zero frequency",
    "the expression ( [ eq35 ] ) was used . at all nonzero matsubara frequencies the standard reflection coefficients ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "were substituted into the lifshitz formula .",
    "the computational results using the standard reflection coefficients at all nonzero matsubara frequencies coincide with those obtained with the general reflection coefficients @xmath140 and @xmath140 .",
    "then we return to the dashed lines in fig .",
    "5(a , b ) representing the difference casimir force computed with the inclusion of screening effects .",
    "more generally , it can be easily seen that for materials with sufficiently small charge carrier density ( for instance for si with @xmath172 ) the general reflection coefficient ( [ eq21 ] ) including the screening effects leads to approximately the same values at room temperature , as the standard one at all nonzero matsubara frequencies .",
    "thus , the theoretical results computed by using the modified tm reflection coefficient ( [ eq35 ] ) are excluded by data at a 70% confidence level .",
    "in the above we have considered the application of the lifshitz theory to real metals , dielectrics and semiconductors . when the conductivity processes , connected with the presence of free charge carriers , are included into the model of the dielectric response , problems and paradoxes in the application of the lifshitz theory are immediately apparent .",
    "they are manifested in the contradictions of the lifshitz theory with both thermodynamics and experiment .",
    "we have listed several measurements performed by different experimental groups with metals , dielectrics and semiconductors which are in contradiction with the theoretical results taking into account the drift current of conduction electrons .    in searching for reasons of why the problems and paradoxes arise ,",
    "it was emphasized that the lifshitz theory was formulated for systems in thermal equilibrium . as a result ,",
    "this theory is not applicable to physical systems where processes go on which violate thermal equilibrium .",
    "specifically , in thermal equilibrium all processes of heat transfer , diffusion and others connected with the dissipation of energy are terminated .",
    "a question then arises if the drift current of charge carriers which leads to a unidirectional flux of joule heat from the casimir plates to the heat reservoir is compatible with the state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "our conclusion is that it is not compatible with thermal equilibrium and , thus , can not be considered in the framework of the lifshitz theory .",
    "the inclusion of conductivity properties in the lifshitz theory is in violation of its basic applicability condition .",
    "we have analyzed recent attempts to solve problems and paradoxes using screening effects and diffusion processes .",
    "we have shown that these attempts are in conflict with thermodynamics and in contradiction with experiment .",
    "this is because diffusion processes make the deviations from thermal equilibrium even more dramatic .",
    "one may conclude that the lifshitz theory , if used within its application region , is free of problems and paradoxes .",
    "problems and paradoxes arise when the basic applicability condition of the lifshitz theory , thermal equilibrium , is not taken into account by using the drude model or introducing the diffusion current .",
    "what is more , phenomenologically the lifshitz theory leads to both thermodynamically and experimentally consistent results if the processes of electric conductivity connected with both drift and diffusion currents are simply disregarded .",
    "future progress should show if these processes have any relation to the phenomenon of dispersion forces ."
