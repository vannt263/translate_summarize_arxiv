    "the exploration of time - dependent backgrounds is of theoretical interest and has cosmological applications . in the context of string theory a natural candidate to study is the tachyon condensation process on unstable branes . in investigating this direction ,",
    "techniques are being developed and in particular a new type of spacelike brane ( s - brane)@xcite has appeared .",
    "this brane is defined as a time - dependent classical solution of the tachyon system .",
    "while s - branes naturally arise in the tachyon system especially with rolling tachyons@xcite , their role and physical significance in string theory , especially in time - dependent backgrounds and ds / cft , is still being developed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for example ) . in this letter",
    "we derive an effective action for s - branes , and show that the s - brane approach can be successfully applied to show that fundamental strings appear during tachyon condensation .",
    "the form of general tachyon actions has been shown @xcite to guarantee that spatial tachyon kinks are universally governed by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) form of d - brane actions .",
    "we similarly derive the effective action for time - dependent tachyon kinks representing s - branes and show it has a universal form so essential features of the s - brane action are independent of the explicit tachyon action . examining the tachyon system of a non - bps d@xmath6-brane we now construct time - dependent classical solutions representing s@xmath7-branes . using the action @xmath8 originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will see how the rolling tachyon picture in ref .",
    "@xcite is reconciled with the s - brane picture . here",
    "@xmath9 with @xmath10 is the tachyon field and dot will denote a derivative with respect to time @xmath11 .",
    "the tachyon potential achieves its maximum at @xmath12 and asymptotes to zero ( closed string vacuum ) at large @xmath13 .",
    "this effective action gives the known exponentially decreasing pressure at late times while being consistent with the string theory calculation where @xmath14 is taken to be an exponential function of @xmath13 . for simplicity we take the tachyon classical solution to depend only on time @xmath11 .",
    "using the fact that energy @xmath15 is conserved , we obtain the homogeneous solution @xmath16 @xmath17 when the tachyon approaches its minimum , @xmath18 , the time - dependence of the tachyon simplifies to @xmath19 .",
    "this constant behavior characterizes the final state of the rolling tachyon .",
    "the location of a static domain wall is determined by the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the classical solution of the domain wall , so time - dependent tachyon solutions are analogously characterized by @xmath12 when the tachyon passes the top of the potential ; the s - brane is found wherever @xmath12 .",
    "we now see that the physical statement of ( [ solt ] ) is that we have chosen the s@xmath7-brane tachyon solution to be the spacelike @xmath22-dimensional space @xmath23 .",
    "deformations of the s - brane worldvolume are given by analyzing fluctuations of the tachyon field around its classical solution ( [ solt ] ) , @xmath24 .",
    "substituting this into the action ( [ senac ] ) and keeping terms quadratic in @xmath25 , one is led to the fluctuation action @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and the time - dependent mass is @xmath28_{t = t_{\\rm cl}}. \\label{mass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factor in front of @xmath29 in the fluctuation action diverges at late time @xmath30 , which shows that the fluctuation @xmath25 is governed by the carrollian metric @xcite and ceases to propagate .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that at the true vacuum of the tachyon theory open string degrees of freedom disappear and we therefore concentrate on the fluctuations around s - branes .",
    "since the solution ( [ solt ] ) breaks translation invariance along the time direction , there is a zero mode on the defect s - brane .",
    "it is well - known that this mode is given by @xmath31 with the function @xmath32 depending only on the coordinates along the s@xmath7-brane .",
    "once this is substituted into the fluctuation action , one finds that the mass term ( [ mass ] ) cancels with the contribution from the term @xmath33 .",
    "the effective action for a massless displacement field @xmath34 is @xmath35 with the positive constant @xmath36 depending only on the energy @xmath37 .",
    "we have therefore determined the s - brane effective action for a euclidean worldvolume to lowest order .    while in the above argument we have introduced only the tachyon field and its fluctuation @xmath32 , it is natural to expect gauge fields on the s - branes , just like on d - branes . following the procedures developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall obtain corrections to the s - brane action from higher order terms in @xmath32 , and determine couplings to the gauge field in the limit of slowly varying fields , @xmath38 .",
    "first we note that the constant gauge field strength appears in the tachyon action only through the overall born - infeld factor @xmath39 and the open string metric @xmath40 used for contracting the indices of the derivatives ( we work in the units @xmath41 ) . requiring that the equations of motion for the gauge fields are also satisfied in the time - dependent homogeneous tachyon background",
    ", we find that the open string metric should satisfy @xmath42 .",
    "this condition , allowing us to introduce dynamical gauge fields while also preserving the tachyon equations of motion , essentially states that we can not turn on electric fields on a euclidean worldvolume .",
    "the second notable point is that the dependence on the zero mode @xmath32 in the tachyon action should be @xmath43 here @xmath44 can be fixed by the global lorentz invariance in the world volume spacetime .",
    "the condition that the lorentz boost preserves the open string metric is @xmath45 where according to the property ( [ betas ] ) we define the lorentz boost as @xmath46 then it is determined that @xmath47 . performing the integration over @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ betas ] ) and including the @xmath48-dependence , we obtain the s - brane action @xmath49 the factor @xmath50 is the tachyon action evaluated with the classical solution @xmath21 . the s - brane action ( [ sac ] ) differs from the usual d - brane action ( dbi action ) in two important respects : first , the action is defined on a euclidean worldvolume , and second the kinetic term of the transverse scalar field @xmath32 has a `` wrong '' sign since it represents time translation .",
    "covariantizing this action , one easily sees that the lagrangian is simply @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the induced metric on the brane .",
    "it differs from the usual dbi lagrangian only by a factor of @xmath53 , and thus has the same equations of motion .",
    "this ensures that their solutions correspond to consistent backgrounds in which conformal symmetry is preserved on the open string worldsheet @xcite .",
    "the location of the s - brane , given by @xmath34 , corresponds to the time when the tachyon passes its potential maximum @xmath12 .",
    "so while in the previous section we have shown that s - branes play an essential role in time - dependent tachyon condensation , it seems rather surprising if s - branes can be used to describe remnants of tachyon condensation , especially in the background @xmath54 . to understand how this is possible ,",
    "let us recall how d - branes are realized in the noncommutative tachyon setup @xcite .",
    "those remnants ( although in static condensation ) are constructed as tachyon lumps at whose core the tachyon sits still around its potential maximum ( @xmath55 ) which we can describe with s - branes .",
    "the second obstacle , which is more intrinsically related to this paper , is that an s - brane is spacelike while any remnants , such as fundamental strings , are timelike . how do we obtain timelike objects from spacelike objects ? to see this in detail , let us return to the s - brane action ( [ sac ] ) . when there are no gauge fields excited on the s - brane , the lagrangian is @xmath56 . to keep this action real",
    "we enforce the condition @xmath57 , in units where @xmath58 , which is the statement that excitations on the s - brane keep the worldvolume euclidean in the target space .",
    "this is analogous to the original motivation for introducing nonlinear electromagnetism by born and infeld @xcite , if one regards @xmath32 as an electrostatic potential @xmath59 .",
    "however , we know that for the dbi action , this critical electric field can be exceeded by turning on appropriate fields . for example turning on transverse scalars @xmath60 we can obtain bion solutions @xcite which have an electric field exceeding the critical value @xmath61 . precisely the same situation can occur for s - branes .",
    "turning on appropriate magnetic fields on the s - brane allows @xmath62 , and in particular , configurations in which @xmath32 goes to infinity .",
    "the physical meaning of having @xmath32 going to infinity is that the worldvolume of the s - brane exists for all the time .",
    "equivalently we can say that the s - brane has decayed into branes or strings at late times .",
    "we now discus the bion - type spike solutions which will represent how fundamental strings appear as remnants in the tachyon condensation process .",
    "let us turn on a single gauge potential @xmath63 and suppose that all the worldvolume fields are independent of @xmath64 .",
    "then the s - brane lagrangian is rewritten as @xmath65 which is exactly the usual static dbi lagrangian for a d@xmath7-brane , under the replacement @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , there are s@xmath7-brane spike solutions ( for @xmath67 ) similar to the bps bions , @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the radial distance along the euclidean worldvolume ( except @xmath64 ) , but we also see from ( [ spikesol ] ) that @xmath70 parametrizes time evolution for this s - brane . as time evolves the radius decreases , therefore the remnant becomes a @xmath71 dimensional object , a string , parametrized by @xmath32 and @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ spike_fig ] ) .",
    "one can calculate the induced metric @xmath72 and find that it is euclidean for @xmath73 .",
    "it is amazing that for @xmath74 the worldvolume becomes timelike so we are describing an object which is moving slower than the speed of light !",
    "this s - brane describes an infinitely long cylindrical worldvolume , where @xmath64 is the infinite direction and the radius of the cylinder , @xmath70 , shrinks with time .",
    "this therefore gives the tantalizing possibility that the solution ( [ spikesol ] ) represents a time - dependent tachyon process which produces fundamental strings .",
    "( 7,0)@xmath70 ( -160,190)@xmath32 ( -270,50)@xmath64 ( 0,-10 )    let us provide evidence showing that this remnant is a fundamental string .",
    "first , the field strength induced on the deformed worldvolume at late times is @xmath75 here we changed the worldvolume variable @xmath70 to @xmath32 , and put in the @xmath76 dependence .",
    "this is the critical electric field induced on the cylindrical worldvolume and indicates that fundamental string charge is induced on the deformed s - brane .",
    "the criticality of the induced electric field is actually expected in tachyon condensation on general grounds . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that for general tachyon effective lagrangians with electric field , the late time behavior of the rolling tachyon is governed by @xmath77 .",
    "when the tachyon stops rolling the electric field @xmath78 reaches its critical value .",
    "since the s - brane surface is characterized by @xmath12 , and at late times the worldvolume of the s - brane stops shrinking , we find @xmath79 .",
    "this shows that at late times the domain @xmath12 is supported only locally at @xmath80 where the electric field becomes critical .",
    "this is consistent with the picture given in ref .",
    "@xcite for describing fundamental strings after the tachyon condensation .",
    "next , we demonstrate that this flux tube has fundamental string tension . in",
    "coordinates more appropriate to the spacetime point of view , the s - brane action is @xmath81 which is @xmath53 times usual dbi action .",
    "the canonically conjugate momenta are @xmath82 and the hamiltonian density is @xmath83 imposing flux quantization @xmath84 and noting that the electric field takes the critical value @xmath85 at late times , we find that the energy becomes @xmath86 where we put in the @xmath76 dependence .",
    "this reproduces the hamiltonian of @xmath87 static fundamental strings with fundamental string tension .",
    "the situation resembles that of ref .",
    "@xcite and supertubes @xcite which have critical electric fields .    finally , we show that this remnant has no d - brane charge at future infinity .",
    "it is natural to take the ramond - ramond ( rr ) coupling for an s - brane to be the same as that for a d - brane .",
    "the coupling of rr fields to the particular s - brane above is @xmath88 transforming @xmath70 into the embedding time @xmath32 we obtain @xmath89 due to the factor @xmath90 which goes to zero at late times , we see that the d - brane charge of this solution shrinks to zero at future infinity .",
    "if as suggested from the static cases @xcite , we assume that any s - brane solution has a corresponding tachyon solution , it is interesting to see why timelike defects are generated from spacelike defects from the viewpoint of tachyon solutions . recall that s - branes are constructed with the open string tachyon and that the open string light cone always lies inside the closed string light cone @xcite .",
    "therefore the region near the spike core @xmath91 can be timelike ( [ induce ] ) in the target space , and also spacelike in the sense of open string metric due to the diverging field strength .",
    "t - duality provides another viewpoint of the problem . in the t - dual picture by compactifying @xmath64 , @xmath63 becomes a spatial coordinate , and the s - brane solution ( [ spikesol ] ) has no time - like region .",
    "the emergence of the time - like domain in the original description is simply due to the general fact that projection of a space - like trajectory onto a lower dimensional subspace can appear to be time - like .",
    "we have shown that the s - brane can be used to study tachyon condensation , however it is not clear if the validity of the s - brane action breaks down at some point due to effects such as radiation of gravitons , open strings or other modes @xcite .",
    "this point is being investigated .",
    "the essential point studied in this paper is that one can make s - branes timelike .",
    "although by definition s - branes are spacelike objects , they are however constructed using the open string tachyon and hence governed by the open string metric . since the light cone of this metric always lies inside the closed string cone , one can boost s - branes to make them timelike relative to the closed string metric .",
    "the construction presented here opens up new possibilities in describing time - dependent tachyon condensation with s - branes .",
    "believing that there is correspondence between the solution of the original tachyon system and the solution of the defect effective action @xcite , the spike solution found in this paper shows how the fundamental string is formed during time - dependent tachyon condensation .",
    "the relation of this process to the confinement picture of the tachyon system @xcite is to be investigated .",
    "in addition , there are numerous avenues to explore using s - brane actions .",
    "d - brane actions have been truly useful for investigating string / m theory , and it is intriguing to see what will be the result of just replacing d - branes by s - branes .",
    "starting with various brane configurations such as s - brane junctions and spherical s - branes , one may examine their supersymmetric properties , their m - theory lift , non - abelian s - brane actions , matrix theory with s - instantons , noncommutative s - branes , s and t - duality on s - brane actions , spacelike fundamental strings , s - branes in cubic string field theory , and numerous subjects .",
    "some of them will be studied in a forthcoming paper .",
