    "the privacy amplification @xcite is a technique to distill a secret key from a source that is partially known to an eavesdropper , usually referred to as eve .",
    "the privacy amplification is regarded as an indispensable tool in the information theoretic security , and it has been studied in many literatures ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recently , the non - asymptotic analysis of coding problems has attracted considerable attention @xcite . especially for the channel coding problem , the relation between various types of non - asymptotic bounds",
    "are extensively compared in @xcite .",
    "the performance of the privacy amplification is typically characterized by the smooth minimum entropy or the inf - spectral entropy @xcite .",
    "there is also another approach , the exponential bound , which has been investigated by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "so far , the relation between non - asymptotic bounds derived by these two approaches has not been clarified .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to compare the min - entropy bound , which is derived by the smooth minimum entropy framework , and the exponential bound . actually , it turns out that the exponential bound is better than the min - entropy bound when a security parameter is rather small for a block length . in the following ,",
    "we explain a reason for this result .    in the achievability part of the smooth entropy framework @xcite or the information spectrum approach",
    "@xcite , a performance criterion of a problem , such as an error probability or a security parameter , is usually upper bounded by a formula consisting of two terms .",
    "one of the terms is caused by the smoothing error , which corresponds to a tail probability of atypical outcomes .",
    "the other is caused by typical outcomes . in the following ,",
    "let us call the former one the type 1 error term and the latter one the type 2 error term respectively .    to derive a tight bound in total ,",
    "we need to tightly bound both the type 1 and type 2 error terms .",
    "this fact has been recognized in literatures .",
    "indeed , one of the authors derived the state - of - the - art error exponent for the classical - quantum channel coding by tightly bounding both types of error terms @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , polyanskiy _ et .",
    "al . _  derived a non - asymptotic bound of the channel coding , which is called the dt bound , by tightly bounding both types of error terms .",
    "the dt bound remarkably improves on the so - called feinstein bound because the type 2 error term is loosely bounded in the feinstein bound .",
    "the improvement is especially remarkable when a required error probability is rather small for a block length .    for the privacy amplification problem , one of the authors derived the state - of - the - art exponent of the variational distance by tightly bounding both types of error terms @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the type 2 error term is loosely bounded in the bound derived via the smooth minimum entropy @xcite .    as is expected from the above argument",
    ", the exponential bound turns out to be better than the min - entropy bound when a security parameter is rather small for a block length . for rather large security parameters ,",
    "the min - entropy bound is better than the exponential bound .",
    "this is because we derive the exponential bound by using the large deviation technique @xcite .",
    "the large deviation technique is only tight when a threshold of a tail probability is away from the average , and this is not the case when a security parameter is rather large for a block length . as the second purpose of this paper , we derive a bound that interpolates the exponential bound and the min - entropy bound .",
    "this is done by a hybrid use of the rnyi entropy and the inf - spectral entropy .",
    "it turns out that the hybrid bound is better than both the exponential bound and the min - entropy bound for whole ranges of security parameters .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : preliminaries ] , we summarize known bounds on the privacy amplification . in section [ section : hybrid ] ,",
    "we propose a novel bound by using the rnyi entropy and the inf - spectral entropy . in section [ section : numerical - calcuation ] , we compare the bounds numerically .",
    "in this section , we review the problem setting and known results on the privacy amplification . although most of results in this section were stated explicitly or implicitly in literatures , we restate them for reader s convenience .",
    "especially , theorem [ theorem : one - shot ] , theorem [ theorem : spectrum ] , and theorem [ theorem : gaussian - approximation ] are classical analogue of those obtained in @xcite for the quantum setting , where the distance to evaluate the smoothing is different .      for a set @xmath0 ,",
