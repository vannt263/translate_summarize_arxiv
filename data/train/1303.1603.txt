    "hadrons have two seemingly incompatible features :    * their ( light ) quark constituents are highly relativistic , consequently hadron wave functions have abundant contributions from sea quarks and gluons .",
    "this is seen in the parton distributions measured in hard processes , and is required by the underlying theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . *",
    "the hadron spectrum reflects just the valence quark ( @xmath6 ) degrees of freedom .",
    "sea quarks and gluons do not manifest themselves as additional states ( multi - quark states , hybrids , glueballs ) .",
    "the spectra of heavy quarkonia are remarkably similar to the atomic spectra of perturbative qed .",
    "this raises the following questions :    1 .",
    "_ what approximation allows relativistic field theory bound states , with prominent multi - particle fock components , to be described by valence quark wave functions ? _",
    "+ the bound states of electrons in a strong coulomb field have fock components with multiple @xmath7 pairs , yet are described by dirac wave functions that have only a single electron degree of freedom .",
    "i discuss why this implies that the norm of the wave function is an inclusive probability density .",
    "i also recall a remarkable feature of the dirac wave functions which has been largely forgotten since the early 1930 s .",
    "_ how does the quark model potential @xmath8 arise in qcd ? _",
    "+ the linear term stems from a non - vanishing boundary condition in solving gauss law for @xmath0 .",
    "the single gluon exchange term is an @xmath9 correction to the linear term .",
    "the perturbative expansion is meaningful provided the strong coupling freezes at low momentum transfers , with several estimates indicating @xmath10 .",
    "the born level green function @xmath11 of an electron in an external @xmath12 field generated by a static charge @xmath13 is obtained by summing all coulomb exchanges between the electron and the charge .",
    "the residue @xmath14 of a bound state pole , @xmath15 , satisfies the dirac equation with potential @xmath16 . in this born approximation",
    "all @xmath17 vertex corrections as well as loops created by the external field are ignored .",
    "since the field is static it does not change the @xmath18 component of the electron momentum . if @xmath19 the @xmath20 regularization is irrelevant at the negative energy poles of the electron propagators , since @xmath21 .    in order to find the wave function of a bound state at an instant of time @xmath22 we need to time - order the interaction vertices .",
    "electrons of negative energy move backward in time , creating so called ` @xmath23-diagrams ' where one ( or several ) additional @xmath7 pairs are propagating along with the electron .",
    "an equal - time , relativistic bound state wave function necessarily contains any number of such pairs . as the strength of the potential increases the bound state becomes more relativistic and the pairs become more prominent .    the usual dirac wave function",
    "@xmath24 depends on the position @xmath25 of a single electron , which may have either positive or negative energy .",
    "this wave function is obtained when retarded , rather than feynman electron propagators are used . as we noted above , the green function @xmath26 is independent of the @xmath20 prescription at the negative energy poles of the electron propagators .",
    "in particular , the bound state energies @xmath27 are the same whether retarded or feynman electron propagators are used .",
    "however , the equal - time wave function is obtained after fourier transforming @xmath28 , and is sensitive to the @xmath20 prescription . in retarded propagation also negative energy electrons move forward in time , there are no @xmath23-diagrams and the amplitude of the single electron present at time @xmath22 is given by @xmath29 .",
    "the fact that the dirac wave function @xmath29 is obtained using retarded ( rather than feynman ) boundary conditions means , in analogy to cross sections @xcite , that @xmath30 should be interpreted as an _ inclusive _ probability density .",
    "as shown by weinberg @xcite , the norm of the dirac wave function should be normalized to unity _ provided the normalizing integral converges_. already in the early 1930 s it was realized @xcite that the normalization integral diverges for most potentials  the @xmath31 potential of @xmath32 dimensions being an exception .",
    "_ e.g. , _ for the linear potential @xmath33 of qed in @xmath34 the norm @xmath35 , and hence the inclusive particle density , is constant at large distances @xmath36 .",
    "this is consistent with the idea of string breaking , particle pairs being created over an interval of @xmath36 where the potential increases by @xmath37 .",
    "it is also in accord with the behavior of the dirac wave function for nearly non - relativistic dynamics , @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the normalization integral being divergent furthermore implies that the dirac spectrum is _ continuous _ rather than discrete @xcite .",
    "curiously , these properties of the dirac solutions have been scarcely discussed since they were first noticed long ago .",
    "the linear confining potential of the quark model is necessary for describing the hadron spectrum .",
    "this introduces a dimensionful constant @xmath39 , which is not present in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "since the schrdinger equation is a born level approximation the constant can not originate from the renormalization of loop integrals .",
    "the only possibility consistent with the underlying theory is then to introduce it via a boundary condition .    in gauge theories the coulomb potential @xmath0 is instantaneous , since its time derivative",
    "does not appear in the lagrangian . at each instant of time",
    "the charge distribution determines @xmath0 through the field equations of motion .",
    "_ e.g. , _ in the hydrogen atom of qed , for each position @xmath40 of the electron and @xmath41 of the proton we find @xmath42 by solving gauss law , @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the standard solution gives rise to the coulomb potential @xmath44 when both the field energy @xmath45 and the interaction energies @xmath46 are taken into account ( the infinite self - energies are independent of @xmath47 and thus irrelevant ) .    the @xmath48 coulomb potential of the hydrogen atom results when gauss law is solved with the boundary condition that @xmath49 as @xmath50 .",
    "if we instead require that the field strength approaches a non - vanishing constant , @xmath51 as @xmath50 , then we have to add a homogeneous solution to gauss law , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a unit vector .",
    "the square of @xmath54 contributes a term @xmath55 to the field energy ( @xmath56 is the volume of space ) .",
    "this term is irrelevant provided @xmath57 is a universal constant , independent of @xmath47 .",
    "the field energy arising from the interference of @xmath58 with the @xmath59 potential is finite provided the state is neutral , and is @xmath60 .",
    "choosing @xmath61 makes the action stationary under variations of the unit vector @xmath62 , preserves rotational invariance and gives rise to the linear potential @xmath63 .    a linear potential arises also in qcd through an analogous boundary condition @xcite .",
    "this does not explain why we should choose @xmath64 in qed and @xmath65 in qcd to describe observed phenomena .",
    "however , it shows that a linear potential is _ compatible _ with the field equations of motion .",
    "@xmath57 is a hidden parameter , not present in the lagrangian , whose value must be determined by experiment .",
    "as indicated above , the solution requires @xmath57 to be a universal constant and the state to be charge neutral . in qcd",
    "bound state solutions were found @xcite for color neutral @xmath66 mesons and @xmath67 baryons .",
    "no analogous solutions exist for states with a higher number of valence quarks .",
    "the linear @xmath0 potential ensures confinement and relativistic binding .",
    "since the potential is instantaneous hadrons may be described using `` inclusive '' valence quark wave functions analogous to those of dirac states .",
    "perturbative corrections can then be added systematically . in the @xmath2-matrix expression @xmath68{\\left\\vert{i}\\right\\rangle}_{\\rm in}$ ]",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states should consist of neutral states bound by the linear potential , instead of the free plane wave states of standard perturbation theory . in effect , one expands around lowest order states which already have the basic features of hadrons such as color confinement . as in the taylor expansion of ordinary functions , the full perturbative series formally gives the exact result independently of the starting configuration .",
    "for the perturbative expansion to be meaningful the strong coupling should freeze at a perturbative value in the infrared .",
    "phenomenological and theoretical studies @xcite find @xmath69 , which justifies the use of perturbation theory .",
    "the poincar invariance of the @xmath2-matrix requires that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states transform covariantly .",
    "equal - time , interacting states transform dynamically under boosts , since the concept of equal time is frame dependent .",
    "the poincar invariance of the action , and the lorentz invariant formulation @xmath70 of the boundary condition , suggests that the bound states should transform correctly under boosts .",
    "a detailed analysis in @xmath34 dimensions showed that the boost operator indeed transforms the states as required . from this",
    "follows , in particular , that the bound state energy @xmath27 has the correct dependence on the cm momentum , @xmath71 . the same dependence was found previously in @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the covariance holds only for an exactly linear potential . under",
    "boosts the @xmath34 wave function contracts @xmath72 $ ] . in the non - relativistic limit @xmath73",
    "this reduces to the usual lorentz @xmath74-factor , but in general the wave function contracts at a rate which depends on the separation @xmath36 of the constituents . in effect , the relevant quantity is thus found to be the kinetic energy @xmath75 rather than the canonical energy @xmath18 familiar from classical physics .",
