    "it is also interesting to see in this case what happens to the upper bound @xcite on the asymmetry ( or equivalently lower bound on the right - handed neutrino masses ) due to the fact that neutrino masses are bounded from above . from eq .",
    "( [ epsndbis ] ) we see that such a bound still exists since the asymmetry is directly proportional to the neutrino mass matrix generated by the triplet .",
    "if we assume a hierarchical pattern of light neutrino masses ( i.e.  @xmath47  ev @xcite ) , this bound is of the same order as in the case 1 , i.e.  @xmath48  gev .",
    "note that in this case where the triplet diagram dominates the asymmetry , this bound is an absolute bound unlike for the pure right - handed neutrino case , because in the ( single ) triplet case there is no self - energy diagram as the one of fig .",

    "let us consider the case where the yukawa couplings @xmath44 of @xmath30 gives @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the out - of - equilibrium condition is well satisfied and there is no sizeable washout effect associated to the @xmath44 couplings .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath44 couplings to the neutrino masses does not exceed @xmath51  ev and is therefore negligible with respect to @xmath52  ev @xcite and @xmath53  ev @xcite .",
    "let us assume in addition for simplicity that the yukawa couplings of the heavier right - handed neutrinos @xmath54 are also relatively small and that the triplet is responsible for the neutrino masses ( with for example @xmath55 ) .",
    "in this case there is no substantial washout from diagrams involving the triplet .",
    "this is due to the fact that the triplet does nt couple directly to @xmath30 and therefore there are no scatterings with a virtual triplet which enter into the boltzmann equation ruling the number density of @xmath30 .",
    "the only potentially dangerous scatterings enter into the boltzmann equation ruling the lepton number density , for instance scatterings such as @xmath56 .",
    "these however are not relevant since , on the one hand , the on - shell triplet contribution is already largely boltzmann suppressed at the temperature of the @xmath30 decay , and since on the other hand , the off - shell triplet contribution is also suppressed by mass and couplings factors . as a result ,",
    "in this example , it is not necessary to consider the explicit boltzmann equations for the calculation of the produced lepton asymmetry .",
    "the asymmetry will be given safely by @xmath57 .",
    "for example the values @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 gev , @xmath60  gev , @xmath61 , @xmath62 give @xmath63 and @xmath64 assuming a maximal phase .",
    "taking @xmath65 we obtain an asymmetry as large as @xmath66 which gives more than enough freedom to get the needed value @xmath67 @xcite(by reducing the phase for example ) . in this numerical example , an increase in @xmath68 ( resulting from increasing the @xmath46 and @xmath35 couplings ) results simply in a linear increase of the produced lepton asymmetry .",
    "finally note that all the discussion above for this case remains true even for @xmath69 , as long as the triplet contribution dominates the neutrino masses as we assumed here .",
    "in particular , except if there are cancellations in the interplay of phases , @xmath70 remains dominant over @xmath71 and even @xmath72 .",
    "the only additional restriction is that the relation @xmath73 will be violated by at least a factor @xmath74 due to neutrino mass constraints ( i.e.  @xmath75 ) .",
    "this induces a washout from scatterings such as @xmath76 which will be effective at the temperature of the @xmath49 decay , but this washout will be quite moderate because it intervenes only in the boltzmann equation of the lepton number density , not in the one of the @xmath30 number density .",
    "this leaves enough freedom to have successful leptogenesis even for neutrino masses well above the other cosmological bounds @xcite .",
    "let us now consider a possibility that the triplet is much lighter than all the right - handed neutrinos . in this case",

    "therefore there is the additional constraint that the triplet has not to be kept in thermal equilibrium by the gauge scatterings down to a temperature sizeably below its mass ( otherwise an asymmetry can be created only from a boltzmann suppressed number density of triplets ) .",
    "this puts the lower limit on @xmath80 above the lower limit on @xmath81 in the previous cases .    to illustrate this",
    ", one can consider a parameter configuration just opposite to the one of the example in the case 2 , i.e.  with suppressed triplet couplings and larger right - handed neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "considering such a configuration , with for example @xmath82  gev , one can show that a large enough lepton asymmetry can be produced .",

    "note also that a lower bound on the triplet mass still holds here from neutrino constraints , in a similar way as in the case 2 , but this one is not useful as it is below the lower bound on the triplet mass from the gauge scattering washout effects .",

    "one of the consequence of the triplet contribution to leptogenesis is that there is no more an upper limit on neutrino masses from leptogenesis ( see the cases 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in @xmath85 and @xmath72 , the couplings responsible for the tree level decay are not necessarily the ones dominating the neutrino masses .",
    "therefore the neutrino mass constraints do not necessarily imply violation of the out - of - equilibrium conditions on the decay width and associated scatterings , even for degenerate light neutrino masses ( see the cases 2 and 3 ) .",
    "moreover these couplings responsible for the tree level decay can essentially cancel in the numerator and denominator of the asymmetry , leaving an asymmetry depending above all on other couplings much less constrained by the out - of - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the size of the asymmetry is bounded from above only by the size of the neutrino masses ( which results in the lower bound on @xmath49 similar to the one of the usual case without the triplet , i.e.  @xmath149  gev ) .    in left - right symmetric theories with the seesaw mechanism ,",
    "the existence of the triplet @xmath18 is a must if one sticks to renormalizability . regarding neutrino masses , it is a priori impossible to know wether they originate from the triplet or right - handed neutrinos ( or both ) . in this sense",
    "it is equally probable that the triplet or right - handed neutrinos play an important role for neutrino masses and therefore for leptogenesis .",
    "it is still to be seen what happens in more constrained theories such as the minimal renormalizable @xmath1 theory , where the small number of parameters allows one in principle to find out the origin of the seesaw mechanism and in turn the origin of the lepton asymmetry .",
