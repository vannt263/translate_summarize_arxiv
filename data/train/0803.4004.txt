    "the detection of a transiting planet provides a wealth of information which can not be matched by any other planetary detection method at the moment .",
    "there have been over 20 transiting planets detected thus far , and the list is growing rapidlypont / transits.htm ] .",
    "these systems provide the only means for directly measuring a planet s radius .",
    "they also provide a means for measuring the inclination of the orbital plane , which in turn removes the @xmath4 ambiguity of a planet only detected via the radial velocity method . if the host star is bright enough ,",
    "transiting planets also provide a means for measuring their atmospheric composition when the stellar spectrum , in eclipse ( planet behind the star ) , is subtracted from the combined - light out of eclipse spectrum of the star plus the planet ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , very precise measurements of the time of transit can be used to search for and characterise the orbits of other , sometimes very low - mass , planets in the extrasolar system , because these other planets would slightly perturb the transiting planet s orbit ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    despite the recent success of many transit surveys ,",
    "there has yet to be an observation of a transiting planet orbiting a pms hydrogen burning star .",
    "in fact , there is a relative paucity of detected planets orbiting any stars at an age less than @xmath0100 myr .",
    "aside from the recent claim of the detection of a planet orbiting tw hydrae @xcite , we are unaware of any detections of a planet orbiting a @xmath5100 myr hydrogen burning star .",
    "planets are believed to form in protoplanetary discs where formation and accretion , as well as migration , halt following the dispersal of the disc .",
    "@xcite found that roughly 50% of stars lose their discs by @xmath03 myr , while nearly all discs are dissipated by @xmath010 myr .",
    "this places a significant constraint on the formation time of a gaseous giant planet at @xmath310 myr @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a planet around a very young star , specifically @xmath05 myr , would provide important constraints for planetary formation mechanisms , migration time scales and dynamical evolution , and their relation to disc lifetimes and clearing time scales @xcite .",
    "a transiting planet at @xmath05 myr would lead to constraints on the planet mass and radius at an early age , i.e. very near the initial conditions for giant planet evolution , which are essentially unconstrained at the moment .",
    "ngc 2362 is a well studied open cluster whose age ( @xmath05 myr ; @xcite , @xcite ) , which coincides with the tail of the distribution of circumstellar disc lifetimes , and relatively moderate distance ( 1480 pc , @xmath6 = 10.85 ; @xcite ) make it an ideal test bed for the study of stars and their environments during the early pre - main sequence ( pms ) .",
    "for example , the detection of detached eclipsing binary ( eb ) stars in the cluster will provide measurements of each star s mass and radius without the use of a model .",
    "these measurements can , in turn , be used to constrain pms evolution models .",
    "many recent surveys have been conducted to characterise the properties of ngc 2362 .",
    "the most relevant work includes the determination of fundamental cluster properties @xcite , the determination of the circumstellar disc fraction from near - ir excess @xcite , an h@xmath7 emission survey to study t tauri stars and disc accretion @xcite , and a study of primordial circumstellar discs using infrared excesses measured by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ @xcite .      we have completed a high cadence photometric monitoring survey of ngc 2362 , with observations made using the mosaic ii imager on the 4 m blanco telescope at ctio .",
    "there are three primary scientific goals of this survey : one , to discover low - mass eb systems which will allow us to simultaneously measure the mass and radius for each member of the system , two , to search for transiting planets orbiting pms stars , and three , to characterise the rotation periods for low - mass members of the cluster @xcite .",
    "our observations of ngc 2362 were designed to be sensitive enough to detect a large planet ( @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 ) in a ` very hot - jupiter ' orbit , i.e. orbital period @xmath3 3 days @xcite . specifically , given the average observational cadence of @xmath06 min during 18 nights spread over a year with optimal signal - to - noise we ought to be able to photometrically detect planets with @xmath11 around a 0.7 m@xmath12 primary . for lower mass , and hence fainter ,",
    "stars @xcite predicted that we should be able to detect planets with @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath13 orbiting a 0.2 m@xmath12 primary .",
    "this corresponds roughly with the spectroscopic limits from 8 m class telescopes .",
    "@xcite shows that it would be possible to detect the radial velocity ( rv ) signal of a 1@xmath14 planet orbiting a 0.2 m@xmath12 primary in a 1 day orbit down to @xmath15 18 using the uves spectrograph on the very large telescope .",
    "initial simulations by @xcite predicted that there would be 4.7 ebs and zero transiting planets in our data .",
    "these observations are part of a larger photometric survey of 9 young ( @xmath3 200 myr ) open clusters covering a wide range of ages and metallicities ( the monitor project ; @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we developed an automated method to search for occultations in the light curves generated from our ngc 2362 observations .",
    "in particular , we attempt to remove the significant spot - induced variability displayed by many of our young and late - type targets . as transits and",
    "eclipses are essentially the same from a detection standpoint , and can not always be distinguished from the light curve alone , we detect both types of events among our candidates .",
    "we defer the discussion of the eb candidates to a later paper . here",
    "we focus on our transit candidates , for which spectroscopic follow - up observations , to confirm cluster membership and ascertain the source of the occultations by measuring the mass of the occulting body , are underway .",
    "we then perform extensive monte carlo simulations to evaluate our sensitivity to planets of different radii and periods around stars of different masses in the cluster , and use these simulations to place upper limits on the incidence of hot and very hot jupiters ( hjs and vhjs ) at 5 myr .",
    "these upper limits represent constraints on hj incidence at an age of less than 10 myr , when any hjs should have recently finished migrating toward their host star .",
    "they therefore constitute an important measurement for constraining planetary formation and migration time - scales .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : the data reduction process is discussed in section 2 , and our method of cluster membership selection is presented in section 3 .",
    "the technique used to search for occulting systems and the resulting candidates are described in section 4 .",
    "the monte carlo simulations and the derived upper limits on the fraction of stars in ngc 2362 with short period planets , are discussed in section 5 . here",
    "we also compare our sensitivity and results to other transit surveys that have targets stellar clusters . finally , we present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "photometric monitoring data were obtained using the ctio 4 m blanco telescope , with the mosaic - ii imager , during 18 nights from february 2005 to january 2006 .",
    "this instrument provides a field of view of @xmath036@xmath16 36@xmath17 ( 0.37 deg@xmath18 ) , using a mosaic of eight 2k @xmath19 4k pixel ccds , at a scale of @xmath00@xmath2027 per pixel .",
    "a summary of our observations , including the number of frames per night as well as the start and finish time for each night , is given in table  [ table : obs_summary ] .",
    ".summary of photometric observations of ngc 2362 .",
    "night is the night of observations relative to the first night of observations .",
    "start and finish are the beginning and end of the nightly observations , respectively , given in hjd - 2453000.5 . [ cols=\">,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above predictions assume that our achieved sensitivity in ngc 2362 will be the same in each of the clusters we have observed .",
    "most of the monitor targets are both older and less distant than ngc 2362 , meaning in these cases we are probing stars with smaller radii and less intrinsic variability .",
    "as seen in section 5.1.3 , smaller radii should result in an improved sensitivity .",
    "assuming a sensitivity equal to that in ngc 2362 we can estimate the final upper limits on @xmath1 we would expect from monitor .",
    "these values are summarised in table  [ table : n - stars ] .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the limitations of our survey of ngc 2362 .",
    "we have learned that our sensitivity is largely limited by intrinsic stellar variability and stars with large radii .",
    "both of these limitations could be reduced by observing older clusters : there will be less intrinsic variability while the stellar radii will be smaller given that the stars have had more time to contract toward their ms radius .",
    "another way to increase the sensitivity of our survey would be to decrease the point - to - point rms and the noise over time - scales equal to or longer than the duration of a transit .",
    "given that the red and white noise properties of our data are dependent on a number of factors , including the detectors , sky noise , and observing conditions to name a few , there is no simple panacea for reducing the noise .",
    "however , there is one slight change in observing strategy which would generally reduce the noise ( both red , which would have the greatest effect on our brightest targets , and white , which would have the greatest effect on our faintest targets ) in the light curves : conducting all observations within a single observing season . even in many of the light curves with low @xmath21 with respect to a flat model we notice small fluctuations , of order 0.01 mag , in the median flux following large gaps in our observations .",
    "these shifts are real and not the result of systematics .",
    "making all the observations in a single observing season will remove this slight source of variability from our data and create a greater sensitivity to transits .",
    "we also note that this change in strategy would have the added benefit of significantly reducing the computing time necessary to adequately search the light curves for transits using our search algorithm .",
    "we have conducted a search for occultations in ngc 2362 . we observed the cluster on 18 nights from february 2005 to january 2006 with the mosaic ii imager on the 4 m blanco telescope at ctio .",
    "we achieved an average cadence of @xmath06 minutes , which is sufficient to perform differential photometry and search the data set for any transits .",
    "we used a @xmath22 cmd to photometrically select 1813 candidate cluster members .    following the selection of candidate cluster members",
    ", we developed a systematic method for searching and identifying occultations in our light curves .",
    "this method consisted of two major steps : ( 1 ) the identification and removal of intrinsic stellar variability due to rotation , and ( 2 ) the search for transits using the occultation search algorithm of @xcite modified to account for red noise . following the removal of saturated stars and stars too faint for spectroscopic follow - up , we searched a total of 1180 stars for transits , of which about @xmath0475 are expected to be cluster members according to our contamination estimate .",
    "our search identified 15 light curves with reductions in flux that passed all of our detection criteria .",
    "only six of these systems , however , have observed variability that would be compatible with a planetary companion based on the observed occultation depth . some of these systems may be cluster ebs , which would help to provide important constraints on the mass and radius , and by extension evolution , of pms stars .    using a series of monte carlo simulations we predict the number of detectable hjs and",
    "find it is consistent with our null result .",
    "with 99% confidence we place a limit on the fraction of stars in ngc 2362 with 1 - 3 d period hjs at @xmath522% , while we limit the fraction with 3 - 10 d period hjs at @xmath570% , assuming a planetary radius of @xmath23 .",
    "we compare these limits with other cluster surveys and find that we are not as sensitive to transits as other surveys , because we have far fewer targets .",
    "the limits for ngc 2362 provide observational constraints on the fraction of stars with hjs at an age @xmath5 10 myr . from the simulations we also know that our sensitivity to transits increases as the stellar radius decreases , a somewhat non - intuitive result , which supports the findings of @xcite .",
    "finally , we examine the prospects of the monitor project as a whole .",
    "if we assume the same sensitivity is achieved for the entire monitor survey , we will be able to place an upper limit on the number of young stars with a 1.5@xmath2 hj at @xmath02.7% , assuming a null detection .      based on observations obtained at ctio , a division of the national optical astronomy observatories , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . under cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the 2mass , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "this research has also made use of the simbad data base , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
