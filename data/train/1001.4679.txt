    "the idea of kaluza and klein  @xcite of obtaining the electromagnetism - and under the influence of their idea nowadays also the weak and colour fields  @xcite - from purely gravitational degrees of freedom connected with having extra dimensions is very elegant .",
    "more than twenty fives years ago the kaluza - klein[like ] theories were studied very intensively by many authors  @xcite .",
    "although the breaking of the symmetry of the starting lagrange density to the low energy effective ones ( that is to the charges and correspondingly to the gauge fields assumed by the _ standard model of the electroweak and colour interactions _ ) seem very promising , the idea of kaluza and klein was almost killed by the `` no - go theorem '' of e. witten  @xcite telling that these kinds of kaluza - klein[like ] theories with the gravitational fields only ( that is with vielbeins and spin connections ) have severe difficulties with obtaining massless fermions chirally coupled to the kaluza - klein - type gauge fields in @xmath3 , as required by the _",
    "standard model_. there were attempts to escape from the `` no - go theorem '' in compact extra spaces by having torsion  @xcite , or by having an orbifold structure  @xcite , or by putting extra gauge fields by hand in addition to gravity in higher dimensions  @xcite , which is no longer the pure kaluza - klein[like ] theory and loses accordingly the elegance .    since there is the assumption that the space is _ compact _ in the `` no - go theorem '' of e. witten , there are also the attempts to achieve masslessness by appropriate choices of vielbeins in _ noncompact _ spaces , one of works  @xcite",
    "is commented in the footnote   sphere , recognizing that with the zweibein of @xmath2 ( he calls in this case @xmath2 a compact space ) there are no massless spinor states , while with at least a little `` stronger '' zweibein than with that of @xmath2 ( like with @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 reproduces @xmath2 ) there are two massless states .",
    "although the author wrote differently , these two massless states belong to the left and the right handed state with respect to @xmath7 , and therefore not mass protected , and would correspondingly lead to massive fermion states . ] .",
    "there are several attempts to point out the importance of non compact extra dimensions , like  @xcite , many of them surveyed in  @xcite .",
    "these attempts do not really try to keep the kaluza - klein approach in the original elegant version , they rather embed strings , membranes , p - branes into higher dimensional spaces .",
    "the most popular models of this kind are probably randall - sundrum models  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in this paper in extra dimensions in the kaluza - klein sense : that is as a possibility that the gravity ( and only gravity ) in extra dimensions manifests as the _ standard model _ gauge fields in @xmath8 , coupled to the corresponding charges . in refs .",
    "@xcite we achieved masslessness of spinors in the pure kaluza - klein[like ] theory ( for the case of @xmath9 manifold broken into @xmath10 an infinite disc ) with the appropriate choice of a boundary limiting the extra dimensions on a finite surface on a disc .    in the proposed paper",
    "we take the whole two dimensional plane , and roll it up into an almost @xmath2 with one point - the south pole - excluded .",
    "it is our choice of a _",
    "zweibein _ which forces the two extra dimensions into an almost @xmath2 .",
    "thus , although it has a finite volume ( namely the surface of @xmath2 ) , the space is _",
    "non compact_. we require spinor states to be in the fifth and sixth dimensions _ normalizable _  , proving that the normalizable solutions form a complete set .",
    "it is our choice of a _",
    "particular spin connection field _",
    ", with the strengths within an interval , which allows only one normalizable massless state of a particular handedness ( with respect to @xmath8 ) , breaking the parity symmetry .",
    "the _ finite volume _ of an _ infinite _ disc , an appropriate _ choice of the spin connection field _ with the strength @xmath11 allowed to be within the whole interval @xmath12 and the _ normalizability _ requirement make the mass spectrum of our hermitean hamiltonian in a noncompact space discrete , with only one massless state of particular charge chirally coupled to the kaluza - klein gauge field .",
    "it is the sign of @xmath11 which makes a choice of the handedness of a massless state , breaking the parity symmetry .",
    "the usually expected problem with extra non compact dimensions having a continuous spectrum is _ not present _ in our model .",
    "for a particular choice of the strength of the spin connection field we find the states and the spectrum ( the masses ) analytically .",
    "this mass spectrum of states forms the complete set on our almost @xmath2 . for the remaining values of the strength , for all of which only one massless solution of a particular handedness in @xmath8 exists , it is not difficult to find the recursive formulas for normalizable solutions and the masses . accordingly in this two dimensional noncompact space , with the spin connections and vielbeins which both are",
    "a part of the gravitational gauge fields and with no presence of an ( additional ) external field , the `` no - go theorem '' of e. witten is not valid .",
    "we also characterize the `` singularity '' which the spinor solutions `` feel '' on our infinite disc with the zweibein of a @xmath2 sphere , when treating the disc as the almost @xmath2 sphere , that is the @xmath2 sphere with the hole on the southern pole , so that we have almost @xmath13 case , that it is almost a compact space .",
    "let us add : as it is not difficult to recognize , the two dimensional spaces are very special  @xcite .",
    "namely , in dimensions higher than two , when we have no fermions present and only the curvature in the first power in the lagrange density , the spin connections are normally determined from the vielbein fields , and the torsion is zero . in the two dimensional spaces ,",
    "the vielbeins do not determine the spin connection fields .",
    "in the present article we pay attention to cases , which we call _ an effective two - dimensionality _ , when the spin connections are not fully determined by the vielbeins .    in the here proposed types of models",
    "there is the chance for having chirally mass protected fermions in a theory in which the chirally protecting effective four dimensional gauge fields are _ true _ kaluza - klein[like ] fields , the degrees of which inherit from the higher dimensional gravitational ones .",
    "we are thus hoping for a revival of true kaluza - klein[like ] models as candidates for phenomenologically viable models !",
    "one of us has been trying for long to develop the _ approach unifying spins and charges and predicting families _ ( n.s.m.b . )  @xcite so that spinors which carry in @xmath14 nothing but two kinds of the spin ( no charges ) , would manifest in @xmath7 all the properties assumed by the _",
    "standard model _ and does accordingly share with the kaluza - klein[like ] theories the problem of masslessness of the fermions before the electroweak like types of break .",
    "we present briefly the ideas of the _ approach _ in the footnote   a simple starting action for spinors with the two kinds of the spin generators ( @xmath15 matrices ) : the dirac one , which takes care of the spin and the charges , and the second one , anticommuting with the dirac one , which generates families . for the explanation of the appearance of the two kinds of the spin generators we invite the reader to look at the refs .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .",
    "a spinor couples in @xmath16 to the vielbeins and ( through two kinds of the spin generators to ) the spin connection fields .",
    "appropriate breaks of the starting symmetry lead to the left handed quarks and leptons in @xmath7 , which carry the weak charge while the right handed ones are weak chargeless .",
    "the _ approach _ is offering the answers to the questions about the origin of families of quarks and leptons , about the explicit values of their masses and mixing matrices ( predicting the fourth family to be possibly seen at the lhc or at somewhat higher energies ) as well as about the masses of the scalar and the weak gauge fields , about the dark matter candidates , and about breaking the discrete symmetries .",
    "there are many possibilities in the _ approach _ for breaking the starting symmetries to those of the _ standard model_. these problems were studied in some crude approximations in refs .",
    "@xcite and are under consideration  @xcite . ] .",
    "let us point out that in odd dimensional spaces and in even dimensional spaces divisible by four there is no mass protection in the kaluza - klein[like ] theories  @xcite .",
    "the spaces therefore , for which we can have a hope that the kaluza - klein[like ] theories lead to chirally protected fermions and accordingly to the effective theory of the _ standard model of the electroweak and colour interactions _ , have @xmath17 dimensions . and breaking symmetries in such spaces , if starting with one weyl spinor , and accordingly with the mass protected case , should again lead to mass protected cases in accordance with the _ standard model_.",
    "we prove in this section that in @xmath18 an infinite disc with the particular zweibein and spin connection on the disc there exists only one massless normalizable ( on the disc ) fermion state of only one handedness and of a particular charge .",
    "it is accordingly mass protected .",
    "we also present proofs that the hamiltonian is hermitean and the spectra of normalizable states correspondingly discrete . for a particular strength of the spin connection field we present the spectrum and states .",
    "we discuss the properties of solutions for the strengths allowed by the normalizability requirement .",
