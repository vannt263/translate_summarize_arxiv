    "the ultra - short high intensity laser pulses have many applications such as laser - guided electric discharge  @xcite , terahertz generation  @xcite and remote sensing  @xcite . such applications need extremely high light powers which can be obtained via the collapse of pulses  @xcite . for a gaussian beam ,",
    "if the initial peak power exceeds the critical power for self - focusing , the beam will undergo collapse until the higher - order processes such as plasma or high - order kerr effects halt the collapse  @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the collapse distance @xmath0 ( the propagation length of the self - focusing beam until collapse ) can be well approximated by a semi - empirical formula  @xcite @xmath1 ^ 2 - 0.0219}}~ , \\label{semi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the refractive index , @xmath3 is the beam width which is at @xmath4 level of intensity , @xmath5 is the laser wavelength in vacuum , @xmath6 is the initial pulse s peak power , and @xmath7 is the critical power for self - focusing which can be written as @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the kerr index .",
    "however , for the very high powers such as @xmath10 , experiments and numerical simulations show that the collapse distance can not be described by @xmath11 and a transition from a @xmath12 to a @xmath13 scaling was observed  @xcite .",
    "recently , simulations show that the group - velocity - dispersion ( gvd ) has a great influence on @xmath0 when the pressure is relatively high , e.g. , @xmath14  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the collapse distance of femtosecond laser pulses in air for different temporal durations .",
    "we find that for the `` very short '' pulses , there exists a threshold for the initial power , with which the collapse distance has a maximum value .",
    "more importantly , new semi - empirical formulas are obtained for the collapse distance of the pulse with the initial power being less than or larger than the threshold .",
    "the new formulas take into account of the influence of gvd and can match the numerical simulations perfectly , including the cases of high pressures at which the gvd becomes more important .",
    "the physical processes which halt beam collapse is still controversial .",
    "some groups think the plasma prevents collapse ( kerr - plasma model )  @xcite , while other groups believe the collapse is stopped by the high - order kerr effects ( hoke model )  @xcite . fortunately , the collapse distances are almost the same for kerr - plasma model and hoke model  @xcite , since the hoke and the plasma effect becomes important only after the pulse has collapsed  @xcite , and this phenomena has also been confirmed in our numerical simulations ( not shown here ) . in this work",
    "we study the collapse distance of the pulse for different temporal durations via hoke model , which can be described by an extended non - linear schrdinger equation ( nlse )  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the envelope of the electric field , and @xmath17 denotes the propagation distance .",

    "it can be seen that the collapse distances of the two pulses have big difference ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "in contrast , the semi - empirical formula in eq .",
    "( [ semi ] ) gives @xmath48 since it does not takes into account of the pulse s duration .",
    "therefore , the temporal duration of pulse may have a large influence on the collapse distance in some circumstances .",

    "we can observe that @xmath53 can approximate @xmath54 very well for the long durations such as @xmath43=60fs , 80 fs and 100 fs , but it fails for the short ones , e.g. , @xmath43=@xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in order to see",

    "[ fig : figure4 ] we can get the same conclusion as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : figure2 ] and [ fig : figure3 ] that @xmath54 has a maximal value when the temporal duration is very short .",
    "it is worth pointing out that `` very short '' is relative to the radius of pulses .",

    "the input beam are gaussian pulses with @xmath50 .",
    "the temporal durations of the pulses are @xmath62 , @xmath44 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "[ fig : figure4],width=396 ]    the phenomena that @xmath53 can not fit @xmath54 well for the `` very short '' pulses is due to gvd .",
    "the normal gvd enables power exchanges between different time slices of the pulse and disperses the latter in time , and this may contribute to maintaining the pulse self - guiding at smaller intensity levels  @xcite .",
    "if the pulse s temporal duration is long enough , the effects of gvd can be neglected when the propagation distance is less than the collapse distance , and thus @xmath53 can fit the collapse distance very well . however ,",
    "if the pulse s temporal duration is very short , the gvd effect will have a strong competition to the kerr self - focusing effect when the initial power is small .",
    "let s consider an extremely short pulse with small initial peak power . in this extreme situation ,",
    "the gvd effect overwhelms the kerr self - focusing , and the collapse distance equals the propagation distance at which the peak intensity decreases to @xmath7 . at the same time",
    ", the temporal duration varies with @xmath17 as @xmath67^{1/2}$ ]  @xcite , here @xmath68 denotes the dispersion length  @xcite , and thus the peak power can be written as @xmath69 .",
    "the collapse distance in this case can be approximated by @xmath70 this equation may account for the phenomena that the collapse distances of short pulses increase with @xmath51 when @xmath71 ( figs . [",
    "fig : figure2]-[fig : figure4 ] ) , though eq . [ extreme ] can not be used to estimate @xmath54 accurately in general cases .    with closer inspections for figs .",
    "[ fig : figure2]-[fig : figure4 ] , we find that @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath51 when @xmath59 , and the slope is dependent on the temporal duration and the radius of pulse . taking into account the gvd effects ,",

    "when @xmath75 gvd dominates , while for @xmath76 kerr self - focusing dominates .    from eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we can see that when @xmath71 the collapse distance is mainly determined by the gvd and the diffraction , otherwise , all the gvd , the diffraction and the kerr self - focusing plays important roles .",
    "the input power threshold @xmath58 can be obtained via equaling eq .",
    "( [ new1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ new2 ] ) .",
    "the relations between @xmath58 , the duration @xmath43 and the radius @xmath3 of the laser pulse are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath58 increases with @xmath3 .",
    "at the same time , @xmath58 decreases with @xmath43 , and it reduces to @xmath7 in the the limit of @xmath77 .     on the pulse s duration and pulse s radius .",
    "[ fig : figure5],width=396 ]    in real applications of the new semi - empirical formula , we do not need the value of @xmath58 .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ new1 ] ) is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath6 , while eq .",
    "( [ new2 ] ) is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath6 , and the value of input power corresponding to the intersection of these two functions is @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , we can directly use @xmath78 to obtain the collapse distance @xmath54 for a given @xmath6 , without knowing the value of @xmath58 .",
    "[ fig : figure6 ] shows the comparisons of the collapse distances between the new semi - empirical formula , the direct numerical simulations , and the conventional semi - empirical formula .",

    ", we obtain the collapse distance of @xmath79 ( 207 m in simulation ) for @xmath44 and 134 m ( 135 m in simulation ) for @xmath45 .",
    "( 7 ) can also be used to calculate the collapse distance at high pressures .",
    "@xmath80 is inversely proportional to the pressure , and play more important roles at high pressure .",
    "for example , in the work of  @xcite , the authors obtained the collapse distance of the pulse with @xmath81 fs and @xmath82  mm , @xmath83 is 2.3 m at 10 atm , while the new semi - empirical formula gives @xmath84 m , perfectly matched .",
    "gvd plays important roles in the evolution of the laser pulses in air . for the short pulses , due to the competition between gvd and kerr self - focusing ,",
    "there exists a threshold @xmath58 for the initial power , with which the collapse distance has a maximum value .",
    "if the initial power is less than the threshold , the collapse distance is proportional to the input power .",
    "if the initial power is larger than the threshold , the collapse distance decreases with the the input power , and is larger than that obtained by the conventional semi - empirical formula . taking into account the effects of gvd , we present new semi - empirical formulas , which match the numerical simulations very well .",
