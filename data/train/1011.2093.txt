    "the host galaxies have the median @xmath115 compare to @xmath116 of the main galaxies .",
    "a bootstrap resampling experiment shows @xmath117 to have such a difference in the median by chance . in the case of early - type galaxies we find @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and for late types @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    "this implies that sne ia are more likely to occur in isolated galaxies without close neighbors within the virial radius .",
    "next , we ask the question if sn ia host galaxies are in a different cluster environment compared to the main galaxies . since our selected abell clusters have @xmath64 , we construct a sample , host-2 , that consists of 21 sn ia host galaxies that are in the main galaxy sample , therefore @xmath66 , and have @xmath64 .",
    "the distance to the nearest abell cluster was derived in two steps .",
    "the velocity difference and the angular separation between the target host galaxy and the center of a selected abell cluster was calculated . among the abell clusters that have a velocity difference smaller than @xmath122 km s@xmath1 with respect to the target galaxy , we select the nearest one having the smallest projected distance @xmath123 to the target sn ia host galaxy at the host galaxy s redshift . if the projected distance @xmath123 is greater than @xmath124 mpc , then this host galaxy is not likely to be a member of the nearest abell cluster . in such cases ,",
    "we choose the three dimensional distance from the center of the cluster to the target host galaxy with radial distance estimated from the redshift difference .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the distributions of @xmath123 of the main galaxies ( dashed line ) and the host galaxies ( solid line ) .",
    "two distributions show a visible difference despite large uncertainties .",
    "the host-2 galaxy sample has the median @xmath123 of @xmath125 @xmath37 mpc while the main galaxies have the median @xmath123 of @xmath126 @xmath37 mpc , and the probability of having such a difference in @xmath123 is @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , it is statistically significant that the host galaxies are located closer to the abell clusters compared to the main galaxies .",
    "mannucci et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reported that cluster early - type galaxies have a significantly higher sn ia rate than field early - type galaxies that can not be explained by observational biases .",
    "although our samples are not limited to early - type galaxies , our result also shows sn ia host galaxies tend to be located near massive galaxy clusters .",
    "many studies have investigated the relationships between the galaxy properties and the local density ( dressler 1980 ; lewis et al .",
    "2002 ; goto et al . 2003 ; balogh et al . 2004 ; baldry et al . 2006 ; cooper et al . 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ; park et al . 2007 ; park et al . 2008 ; park & choi 2009 ; park & hwang 2009 ; hwang & park 2009 ; bamford et al .",
    "dressler ( 1980 ) first employed the projected local density based on counting the number of the nearby neighbor galaxies and defined the local density as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the distance to the _",
    "n_th nearest neighbor galaxy .    in this study",
    ", we adopt the projected local density based on the fifth nearest neighbor galaxy as the density estimator . to search for the fifth nearest neighbor galaxy ,",
    "a volume - limited sample of density tracer galaxies was constructed with the absolute magnitude in @xmath2-band @xmath130 and the redshift in the range @xmath44 since the redshift limit corresponding to @xmath131 is @xmath132 in the case of the main galaxies .",
    "the density tracers are those within the rectangular box at the upper left corner of figure [ fig2 ] . a sample of galaxies that are within the same redshift limits of the density tracer and the apparent magnitude limit of the main galaxies were then selected .",
    "we call this sample host-3 .",
    "it consists of 31 early types and 46 late types .",
    "we also call the main galaxies in the same volume as main-3 .",
    "we find the fifth nearest neighbors of the host-3 and main-3 galaxies among the density tracer galaxies .",
    "it is the fifth nearest galaxy in terms of angular separation and has the velocity difference @xmath133 km s@xmath1 with respect to a target galaxy .",
    "the adopted local density estimator is @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the projected distance from the target galaxy to the fifth nearest neighbor galaxy at the redshift of the target galaxy .",
    "the distribution of @xmath136 around sn ia host galaxies and the main galaxies is shown for each morphological subset in figure [ fig8 ] . the solid line and dashed line correspond to the host galaxy sample and the main galaxy sample , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows that the distribution of @xmath136 of sn ia hosts has a peak shifted to lower density regions compared to that of the main galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the finding in section [ secrnei ] that the sn ia host galaxies tend to be isolated ones .",
    "there exists a slight excess in sn ia occurrence for galaxies at very high densities ( @xmath137 @xmath71 mpc@xmath72 ) , which is again consistent with the result of the cluster environment study , but the statistical significance is not high .",
    "the median @xmath136 of these host galaxies is @xmath138 while that of the main galaxies is @xmath139 , and the probability of having such a difference is @xmath140 . in the case of early - type galaxies we find @xmath141 , and for late types @xmath142 .",
    "the sdss - ii supernova survey has found about 612 spectroscopically confirmed sne ia in the stripe 82 centered on the celestial equator covering an area of 300 deg@xmath25 .",
    "we found the host galaxies associated with 512 sne ia using the sdss photometric and spectroscopic catalogs .",
    "the main galaxies were used as a comparison sample . a sample of abell cluster was also used to investigate the effects of nearby clusters on sn ia occurrence .",
    "statistical tests were performed to compare the distribution of the host galaxies with those of the mock samples generated from the distribution of the main galaxies .",
    "our results are as follows .    1 .",
    "the color distribution of sn ia host galaxies is almost same as that of the main galaxies , regardless of the galaxy morphology .",
    "however , the sn ia rate per unit stellar mass is higher in bluer galaxies than in redder galaxies . 2 .",
    "independent of morphological type , we find that sne ia are most likely to occur in galaxies with @xmath86 mag .",
    "furthermore , we find an underabundance of sne ia in galaxies brighter than @xmath143 , also independent of morphological type .",
    "finally , for galaxies brighter than @xmath144 the luminosity distribution of sn ia host is statistically similar to that of the main galaxies .",
    "isolated galaxies tend to have sn ia more frequently than galaxies having neighbors within their virial radius .",
    "sn ia host galaxies tend to be located near massive galaxy clusters in agreement with previous works ( mannucci et al .",
    "2008 ; carlberg et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "many studies have been made on sn rate versus properties and environments of their host galaxies .",
    "cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1993 ) measured the sn rate from 54 sne discovered by sn searches carried out at the asiago and sternberg observatories .",
    "these samples have lower redshifts than sdss samples and contain only 15 sn ia .",
    "they found that the sn events are proportional to the galaxy luminosity regardless of the morphology and the sn ia rate in early types is smaller than that in late types .",
    "this result , however , is uncertain because of the small number of sample galaxies .",
    "our result using a larger sample of 87 sn ia data suggests that sn ia events have dependence on the luminosity of their host galaxies regardless of the morphology except for most luminous galaxies .",
    "the result shows that sne ia prefer not to occur in too bright or too dim galaxies .",
    "however , part of this dependence can be explained by selection effect that there are fewer sne in low - luminosity galaxies and sne hosted by early - type galaxies are fainter ( gallagher et al . 2005 ) .",
    "mannucci et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have studied the sn ia rate per unit stellar mass as a function of @xmath145 color for nearby galaxies .",
    "they found that blue galaxies have a higher sn ia rate than red galaxies .",
    "when we normalize the sn ia rate to the stellar mass , the sn ia rate shows a similar result that the sn ia rate in the bluer galaxies is larger than in the redder galaxies with respect to @xmath146 .",
    "sharon et al . ( 2007 ) studied cluster sn rate in low - redshift galaxy clusters with @xmath147 and found that the sn rate in a galaxy cluster is similar to the rate in a field elliptical galaxy .",
    "this is also based on a small sne ia sample .",
    "our analysis of the environment effects of nearby abell clusters on the host galaxies shows that sn ia events are more frequent in the galaxies located close to massive galaxy clusters .",
    "this is in agreement with the finding that the host galaxies are more clustered than the field galaxies ( carlberg et al .",
    "2008 ) .    a recent study using sdss - ii sn data with @xmath148 by cooper et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that sn ia events in blue host galaxies prefer to occur in the low - density region while there is no difference between the environment distributions of red host galaxies and galaxies of like properties .",
    "we also find a weak signal that the sn ia rate is higher for galaxies located in relatively low density regions regardless of their morphologies . on the other hand , analysis of the distance to the neighbor galaxy",
    "shows that sn ia events are more frequent in isolated galaxies without close neighbors .",
