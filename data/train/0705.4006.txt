    "for integrable models , the relationship between classical and quantum systems is in no way exhausted by their correspondence in the classical limit .",
    "as is now well known , classical integrable equations often appear in quantum integrable problems as exact relations even for @xmath1 .    one important example of this general phenomenon was investigated in @xcite , where it was shown that the spectrum of commuting transfer matrices ( integrals of motion ) in quantum integrable models can be found in terms of discrete classical dynamics , also integrable , defined in the space whose points label the commuting transfer matrices . for integrable @xmath2-invariant spin chains",
    "coordinates in this space are parameters specifying finite - dimensional irreducible representations of the group @xmath2 and the spectral parameter .",
    "the classical dynamics in this space is generated by functional relations for the transfer matrices established in @xcite for the ordinary bosonic case and extended to the supersymmetric case in @xcite . among them",
    "the most important is the bilinear functional equation for the eigenvalues of the transfer matrices ( @xmath3-functions ) which has the form of the hirota bilinear difference equation @xcite . for brevity , we call it the @xmath4-relation",
    ". it is the starting point of our approach .",
    "the hirota equation is probably the most famous equation in the theory of classical integrable systems on the lattice .",
    "it provides a universal integrable discretization of various soliton equations and , at the same time , is a generating equation for their hierarchies .",
    "it is involved in a large body of integrable problems , classical and quantum . like other soliton equations ,",
    "the hirota equation admits ( auto ) bcklund transformations , i.e. , transformations that send any solution to another solution of the same equation .",
    "they allow one to construct a family of solutions that are connected with a particularly simple one by a finite chain of such transformations .",
    "the bcklund transformations play a central role in our method serving as an alternative to the standard bethe ansatz technique .",
    "the nested bethe ansatz solution of @xmath2-invariant spin chains consists in successive increasing the rank of the group by applying the bethe ansatz repeatedly . in this way",
    ", one can descend from @xmath2 to @xmath5 until the problem gets trivialized at @xmath6 . at intermediate stages of this procedure ,",
    "one introduces a number of auxiliary  @xmath7-functions \" ( eigenvalues of baxter s @xmath7-operators ) connected with the @xmath3-functions by baxter s @xmath8-relations .",
    "their zeros with respect to the spectral parameter obey the system of bethe equations .",
    "this purely quantum technique has a remarkable classical interpretation @xcite : it is equivalent to a chain of bcklund transformations for the hirota equation .",
    "the @xmath8-relations appear then as a constituent of auxiliary linear problems for the hirota equation .",
    "the rank of the group becomes an additional discrete variable , with the dependence on this variable being again described by the hirota - like equation . since the solutions are polynomials in the spectral parameter , their zeros obey equations of motion of a finite - dimensional dynamical system in discrete time .",
    "the equations of motion are just bethe equations .",
    "recently , this approach was applied @xcite to supersymmetric spin chains constructed by means of @xmath0-invariant solutions to the graded yang - baxter equation @xcite . in this case",
    ", there are two rather then one additional discrete flows corresponding to the bosonic and fermionic ranks , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "their consistency leads to a non - trivial bilinear relation for eigenvalues of baxter s @xmath7-operators ( the @xmath11-relation ) . in the present paper",
    "we extend these results to @xmath0-invariant spin chains with twisted ( quasi - periodic ) boundary conditions .",
    "the twisting parameters enter the solution as continuous parameters of the bcklund transformations .",
    "it is implied that the reader is familiar with the standard notions and facts related to supergroups and their representations @xcite , as well as with the quantum inverse scattering method constructions @xcite .",
    "let us recall the construction of the family of commuting transfer matrices in integrable spin chains .",
    "it is basically the same for ordinary and supersymmetric models .",
    "we consider lattice models ( spin chains ) with the symmetry supergroup @xmath0 constructed by means of @xmath0-invariant @xmath12-matrices . such @xmath12-matrices depend on the spectral parameter @xmath13 and act in the tensor product @xmath14 of two linear spaces , where irreducible representations @xmath15 and @xmath16 of @xmath0 are defined .",
    "the space @xmath17 is usually called auxiliary space and @xmath18 ( local ) quantum space . for our purposes",
    "we need the case when @xmath16 is the vector representation , i.e. , @xmath19 while @xmath15 is an arbitrary tensor representation of the supergroup .",
    "the @xmath12-matrix reads [ rmat ] r_01(u)=u+2_(-1)^p ( ) _ 0(e_)e_. here @xmath20 is parity of the index @xmath21 ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 are matrices with the entries @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are generators of the @xmath27 superalgebra in the representation @xmath15 .",
    "the first ( scalar ) term is to be understood as @xmath28 multiplied by the unity matrix @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the unity element in the group and @xmath31 is the identity operator in the space @xmath18 .",
    "this @xmath12-matrix is the @xmath0-invariant solution to the graded yang - baxter equation @xcite .",
    "the supergroup invariance means that [ inv ] _ 0 ( g)_1 ( g ) r_01(u)= r_01(u ) _ 0 ( g)_1 ( g ) for any @xmath32 .    in order to introduce generalized integrable spin chains on @xmath33 sites ,",
    "take @xmath33 copies of the space @xmath34 ( one for each site of the chain ) and the corresponding @xmath12-matrices @xmath35 acting in @xmath36 .",
    "the hilbert space of states of the model , @xmath37 , is the tensor product of local quantum spaces @xmath38 over all sites of the chain : @xmath39 .",
    "we will call @xmath37 the quantum space of the model .",
    "the quantum monodromy matrix is constructed as the product of the @xmath12-matrices @xmath35 in the space @xmath17 : [ calt ] t(u)=r_01(u-_1)r_02(u-_2)  r_0n(u-_n ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath40 are input data characterizing the ( inhomogeneous ) spin chain .",
    "the supertrace of the quantum monodromy matrix taken in the space @xmath17 gives a family of operators in the quantum space depending on @xmath28 and @xmath15 ( called transfer matrices ) , which mutually commute for any values of these parameters .",
    "a more general construction involves twisted ( quasi - periodic ) boundary conditions defined by means of a diagonal matrix [ gdiag ] g= ( x_1 ,  , x_k , y_1 ,  , y_m)gl(k|m ) ( for simplicity , we identify elements of the supergroup @xmath0 with matrices from its vector representation ) .",
    "then the commuting family of transfer matrices is given by the formula [ t1 ] t^(_0)(u;g)=__0 ( _ 0 ( g)t(u ) ) . the graded yang - baxter equation combined with the @xmath0 invariance implies that they commute for different @xmath28 and @xmath15 ( but not for different @xmath41 ! ) : @xmath42=0 $ ] .",
    "below in this paper we will be especially interested in the case when the representations @xmath15 are  rectangular \" , i.e. correspond to rectangular young diagram . given a rectangular diagram of length @xmath43 and height @xmath44 , let @xmath45 be the corresponding representation .",
    "we define the quantum transfer matrices @xmath46 for rectangular representations in the auxiliary space by the formula [ t2 ] t(a , s , u)= _ _ s^a ( _ s^a ( g)t(u - s + a ) ) .",
    "it differs from ( [ t1 ] ) by the shift of @xmath28 which is convenient in what follows . as a rule",
    ", we will not indicate the dependence on @xmath41 explicitly .",
    "one may formally extend this definition to zero values of @xmath44 and @xmath43 which correspond to the trivial representation @xmath47 ( @xmath48 for any @xmath32 ) . taking into account that @xmath49 for all generators of the superalgebra",
    ", we conclude from formulas ( [ rmat ] ) , ( [ calt ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) that [ t3 ] t(0,s , u)=_j=1^n(u - s-_j ) , t(a,0,u)=_j=1^n(u+a-_j ) where @xmath50 are the same as in ( [ calt ] ) .",
    "so we see that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are unity operators in the quantum space multiplied by scalar polynomial functions .",
    "these functions are fixed input data of the problem .",
    "we put @xmath53 then @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the transfer matrices constructed above are linearly independent but are connected by non - linear functional relations . in particular , the transfer matrices ( [ t2 ] ) for rectangular representations are known @xcite to obey the @xmath4-relation @xmath56 this is the famous hirota bilinear difference equation @xcite , where @xmath3 plays the role of the @xmath57-function .",
    "since all the transfer matrices mutually commute , they can be simultaneously diagonalized by a @xmath28-independent similarity transformation , and thus the same relation is valid for any of their eigenvalues . keeping this in mind",
    ", we will think of the transfer matrices as scalar functions and call them @xmath3-functions .",
    "our strategy is to treat equation ( [ hirota ] ) as the basic equation of the quantum theory trying to derive the results for the spectrum of quantum transfer matrices from it . to do this",
    ", we need to specify the boundary conditions and analytic properties of the solutions .",
    "the boundary conditions will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "the analytic properties in @xmath28 are determined by the type of the @xmath12-matrix ( see a more detailed discussion in @xcite ) . for quantum spin chains with polynomial @xmath12-matrices ( [ rmat ] ) all the @xmath3-functions @xmath46 are polynomials in @xmath28 .",
    "thus we are led to the study of polynomial solutions to the hirota equation .",
    "one should note that the general solution to the hirota equation with the boundary @xmath3-functions at @xmath58 and @xmath59 as in ( [ t3 ] ) is given by the bazhanov - reshetikhin determinant formula @xcite . in our normalization",
    "it has the form [ brdet ] t(a , s , u)=h^-1(u - s , a)_1i , ja t(1 , s + i - j , u + a + 1 - i - j ) , where the function @xmath60 is defined as follows : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 at @xmath64 .",
    "it can be expressed through the gamma - function for any @xmath44 : [ brdet1 ] h(u , a)=2^(a-1)n_i=1^n .",
    "given arbitrary functions @xmath65 , formula ( [ brdet ] ) gives a solution to the hirota equation .",
    "however , in general this solution does not obey the required analytical and boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , the right hand side at @xmath64 has apparent poles at zeros of the function @xmath66 .",
    "their cancelation is possible if the polynomials @xmath65 are chosen in a special way .",
    "we conclude this section by a few words on normalization of the solutions .",
    "it is easy to check that the transformation @xmath67 where @xmath68 are arbitrary functions , leaves the form of the hirota equation unchanged .",
    "one may choose certain normalization of the solutions by fixing these functions in one or another way . in our normalization ,",
    "all the polynomials @xmath46 have one and the same degree @xmath33 equal to the number of sites in the spin chain .",
    "this formally includes special cases when one or more zeros of some of these polynomials are placed at infinity , then the degree is actually less then @xmath33 .",
    "other ways of the normalization are discussed in @xcite . in general position , the solutions ( [ t2 ] ) are irreducible , i.e.",
    ", @xmath46 is not divisible by any polynomial of the form @xmath69 , where at least one of the polynomials @xmath70 has degree greater than @xmath71 .",
    "before proceeding further , it is instructive to consider the case @xmath72 which appears to be rather meaningful , though simple , and thus provides useful analogies and motivations for dealing with more complicated models .",
    "it also emerges as the @xmath73 limit of models with @xmath74 .    at @xmath72",
    "there are no spin degrees of freedom and the @xmath3-functions do not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "as is seen from the definition , they coincide with characters of the element @xmath32 for rectangular representations : @xmath75 .",
    "the characters depend on the parameters @xmath76 entering the matrix @xmath41 ( [ gdiag ] ) .",
    "we assume that all @xmath76 are distinct non - zero numbers . for brevity",
    ", we will write @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 when @xmath41 is fixed .",
    "let us introduce the rational function [ ch1 ] w(t)= , where @xmath79 is an auxiliary variable .",
    "as it follows from the character formulas for supergroups @xcite , @xmath80 is the generating function of the characters @xmath81 while the inverse function @xmath82 is the generating function of the characters @xmath83 : @xmath84 the other characters ( super - analogs of schur functions ) are expressed through @xmath81 or @xmath85 by the jacobi - trudi determinant formulas : [ ch3 ] ( a , s)=_1i , ja(1 , s + i - j)= _ 1i , js(a + i - j , 1 ) .",
    "they imply the bilinear relation for the characters of rectangular representations : @xmath86 which is the @xmath28-independent version of eq .",
    "( [ hirota ] ) .",
    "it is known as the discrete kdv equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) written in the bilinear form .",
    "let us also mention the integral representation of the characters [ ch31 ] ( a , s)=_|t_1|=1 ",
    "_ |t_a|=1 _ 1j < ka |t_j",
    "-t_k |^2 _ n=1^aw(t_n ) t_n^-s-1 dt_n where it is assumed that all singularities of the function @xmath80 are outside the unit circle . this @xmath44-fold integral coincides with the partition function of the asymmetric unitary matrix model written through the eigenvalues .",
    "one can formally extend the definition of characters to negative values of @xmath87 by putting them equal to zero . because @xmath88 at @xmath89 , this is consistent with equation ( [ ch0 ] ) everywhere except at the point @xmath90 . to make the equation valid in the whole @xmath91 plane , one should put either @xmath92 or @xmath93 for any @xmath94 , all other @xmath77 with negative @xmath44 or @xmath43 being zero .",
    "we choose the former option ( consistent with the integral representation ( [ ch31 ] ) ) . using representation ( [ ch3 ] ) , it is not difficult to show that if @xmath95 and @xmath96 then @xmath97 .",
    "summarizing , we have : [ ch4 ]    l ( a , s)=0 +   + a<0 a>0 s<0 , a > k s > m .",
    "we see that the domain where @xmath77 do not vanish identically has the shape of a  fat hook \" formed by the union of the half - strips @xmath98 and @xmath99 together with the horizontal ray @xmath100 from the origin to minus infinity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hkm ] ) .",
    "we denote this domain by @xmath101 .",
    "we call the boundaries at @xmath58 and @xmath102 _ exterior _ and the boundaries inside the right upper quadrant _ interior _ ones .",
    "the characters on the interior boundaries can be found explicitly .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath103 and @xmath104 at @xmath105 are given by the formulas [ ch6 ] ( k , m+n)=(_k=1^kx_k^n ) _ i=1^k_j=1^m(x_i - y_j ) , [ ch6a ] ( k+n , m)=(_m=1^m(-y_m)^n ) _ i=1^k_j=1^m(x_i - y_j ) ( in fact this is a particular case of a more general factorization property , see @xcite , chapter i , section 3 , example 23 ) .",
    "therefore , they are connected by the relation @xmath106 where @xmath107    using the determinant identities ( plcker relations ) for minors of a rectangular matrix built from the elementary characters @xmath108 , one can prove the three - term bilinear relations [ ch8 ]    l ( a+1,s)(a , s)- ( a , s)(a+1,s)=z ( a+1 , s-1)(a , s+1 ) , +   + ( a , s+1)(a , s)-(a , s)(a , s+1 ) = z(a+1 , s)(a-1 , s+1 )    between the characters @xmath109 with the generating function @xmath80 and the characters @xmath110 with the generating function @xmath111 . both @xmath112 and @xmath113 obey the discrete kdv equation ( [ ch0 ] ) and thus relations ( [ ch8 ] ) generate the bcklund transformation for it .",
    "their meaning is to relate characters of @xmath114-representations with different @xmath115 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath116 be the diagonal matrix [ gkmdiag ] g_k , m= ( x_1 ,  , x_k , y_1 ,  , y_m ) obtained from @xmath117 ( [ gdiag ] ) by removing @xmath118 eigenvalues @xmath119 and @xmath120 eigenvalues @xmath121 .",
    "we put [ ch7 ] _ k , m(a , s)=(a , s |g_k , m ) and , in the same way as in ( [ ch1 ] ) , ( [ ch2 ] ) , introduce the generating function of the characters @xmath122 : [ ch1a ] w_k , m(t)= . the obvious recurrence relations [ rec ]    l w_k-1,m(t)=(1-x_k t ) w_k , m(t ) , +   + w_k , m+1(t)=(1-y_m+1 t ) w_k , m(t )    allow one to apply equations ( [ ch8 ] ) , where one should put @xmath123 , @xmath124 at @xmath125 or @xmath126 , @xmath127 at @xmath128 .",
    "in general , the hirota equation has many solutions of very different natures .",
    "the most important additional ingredient which selects the class of solutions relevant to quantum integrable models is the boundary conditions in the variables @xmath87 .",
    "qualitatively , these conditions are the same as those for characters of rectangular representations of supergroups discussed in the previous section , and can be derived by means of a similar reasoning .",
    "furthermore , the explicit formula ( [ rmat ] ) for the @xmath12-matrix implies that the highest coefficient of the polynomial @xmath3-function coincides with the corresponding character : @xmath129 as @xmath73 .",
    "the distinctive feature of the solutions of our interest is that they are required to vanish identically in some parts of the @xmath91-plane .",
    "the domain where they do not do so depends on the symmetry algebra of the quantum model . for the @xmath0-invariant supersymmetric spin chains it is the domain @xmath101 introduced in the previous section ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hkm ] ) .",
    "( for the @xmath2-invariant spin chains it degenerates to the half - strip @xmath130 , @xmath131 together with the two rays @xmath59 , @xmath132 and @xmath58 , @xmath133 . )",
    "similarly to ( [ ch4 ] ) , we can write : [ bcond1 ]    l t(a , s , u)=0 +   + a<0 a>0 s<0 , a > k s > m .    as is easy to see , the shape of @xmath101 is consistent with the hirota equation in the whole @xmath91-plane .",
    "although only the points with non - negative @xmath87 have the direct physical interpretation , it is important to consider the full domain ( the  fat hook \" complemented by the ray ) since otherwise the hirota equation would brake down at the corner point at the origin .",
    "the boundary values of @xmath3-functions have a rather special factorized form fixed by consistency with the hirota equation .",
    "indeed , on the boundary one of the two terms in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hirota ] ) vanishes resulting in constraints on the boundary values .",
    "for example , at @xmath58 eq .",
    "( [ hirota ] ) converts into @xmath134 which is a discrete version of the dalembert equation with the general solution @xmath135 where @xmath136 are arbitrary functions . in a similar way , @xmath137 .",
    "equations ( [ t3 ] ) show that in our normalization @xmath138 while @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is defined in ( [ f13 ] ) .",
    "a similar factorization holds true on the interior boundaries .",
    "however , in general both functions in the product are non - trivial and are to be determined from the @xmath4-relation .",
    "the case of the ordinary group @xmath141 , when the vertical interior boundary coincides with the exterior one , is special in this respect . in this case",
    "all the boundary values enter as fixed input data .",
    "in particular , on the horizontal interior boundary we have @xmath142 .    on the interior boundaries , we impose the condition @xmath143",
    "which is consistent with the corresponding condition ( [ ch ] ) for characters of the supergroup . for the periodic case ( when @xmath41 is the unity matrix ) this condition was pointed out in @xcite . equality ( [ ident ] ) means that the values of the @xmath3-functions at the points of the interior boundaries equally spaced from the corner point differ by a constant factor only .",
    "note that this condition trivially holds in the case @xmath144 , where these values are fixed from the very beginning as input data . as it was already mentioned , at any @xmath145 they are no longer fixed but are to be determined together with the @xmath3-functions inside the domain @xmath146 .",
    "concluding this section , we note that the parameters @xmath147 do not enter explicitly neither the hirota equation nor the boundary conditions for it .",
    "this means that the hirota equation with the fixed boundary conditions on the exterior boundaries of the form ( [ t3 ] ) has a continuous @xmath148-parametric family of polynomial solutions .",
    "like almost all known nonlinear integrable equations , the hirota equation is a compatibility condition for an over - determined system of linear problems @xcite . to introduce them ,",
    "it is convenient to pass to the  chiral \" variables @xmath149 the original variables @xmath150 will be referred to as  laboratory \" ones .",
    "here are the formulas for the inverse transformation , @xmath151 and for the transformation of the vector fields : @xmath152    we set @xmath153 and introduce the following linear problems for an auxiliary function @xmath154 : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is a parameter . in these formulas , we indicate explicitly only those variables that are subject to shifts . using these equations ,",
    "the function @xmath157 can be represented as a linear combination of @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 in two different ways .",
    "compatibility of the linear problems means that the results are to be equal .",
    "equating the two expressions we see that the terms proportional to @xmath161 and @xmath160 cancel automatically while the terms proportional to @xmath162 yield a non - trivial relation ( provided @xmath159 does not vanish ) @xmath163 @xmath164 this equality states that the function @xmath165 is a periodic function of @xmath166 with period @xmath23 and an arbitrary function of @xmath167 . because no special periodicity is implied , we set this function to be @xmath166-independent .",
    "therefore , we arrive at the relation @xmath168 where @xmath169 can be an arbitrary function of @xmath170 and @xmath171 . in the original variables this equation reads @xmath172from the boundary conditions ( [ t3 ] ) at @xmath58 or @xmath59 it follows that @xmath173 and",
    "we obtain the hirota equation ( [ hirota ] ) .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath156 entering the linear problems disappears from the non - linear equation .",
    "in fact this is clear from the very beginning because @xmath156 can be eliminated from equations ( [ lp3 ] ) by the transformation @xmath174 .",
    "nevertheless , we keep this parameter because it will be important in what follows .",
    "an advantage of the  chiral \" variables is their separation in the linear problems : the first problem does not involve @xmath171 while the second one does not involve @xmath170 .",
    "however , in contrast to the  laboratory \" variables @xmath150 , they have no immediate physical meaning . coming back to the  laboratory \" variables ,",
    "we set @xmath175 and rewrite the linear problems ( [ lp3 ] ) in the form @xmath176 in general , compatibility of linear problems implies existence of a continuous family of common solutions . as we have seen , the structure of the coefficient functions in our case is such that the compatibility is equivalent to the existence of _ at least one _ common solution ( see @xcite , where this fact was pointed out in another context ) .    because the @xmath3-functions can vanish identically at some @xmath87 , we eliminate the denominators by passing to the new auxiliary function @xmath177 , in terms of which we have @xmath178 note that the second equation can be obtained from the first one by the transformation @xmath179 ( and the same for @xmath180 ) which leaves the hirota equation invariant .",
    "however , the hirota equation written for the function @xmath181 is form - invariant with respect to a larger symmetry group consisting of any permutations and changing signs of the variables @xmath150 but the system of the linear problems ( [ lp5 ] ) is not .",
    "in fact the symmetry is realized in an implicit way . to make it explicit , we write the pair of equations ( [ lp5 ] ) in a matrix form , @xmath182 and multiply both sides by the matrix inverse to the one in the left hand side . using the @xmath4-relation",
    ", we get another pair of linear problems , @xmath183 which are equivalent to ( and thus compatible with ) the pair ( [ lp5 ] ) by construction .",
    "the set of four linear problems ( [ lp5 ] ) , ( [ lp52 ] ) possesses the required symmetry .",
    "the hirota equation can be derived as a compatibility condition for any two linear problems of these four , and the other two hold automatically .",
    "the four linear equations can be combined into a single matrix equation [ lp531 ] ( a , s , u ) (    c f(a - 1 , s , u ) +   + f(a , s + 1 , u ) +   + f(a , s , u - 1 ) +   + z f(a - 1 , s + 1 , u - 1 )    ) = 0 , where @xmath184 is the antisymmetric matrix @xmath185 the hirota equation implies that its determinant vanishes and rank of this matrix equals 2 .",
    "the symmetric form of the linear problems for the hirota equation was suggested in @xcite . for more details on the linear problems and their symmetries",
    "see @xcite .",
    "there is a remarkable duality between @xmath46 and @xmath186 @xcite : one can exchange their roles and treat eqs . ( [ lp5 ] ) as an over - determined system of linear problems for the function @xmath3 with coefficients @xmath180 .",
    "their compatibility condition is the same hirota equation for @xmath180 : [ lp6 ] f(a , s , u+1)f(a , s , u-1)= f(a , s+1,u)f(a , s-1,u)+ f(a+1,s , u)f(a-1,s , u ) .",
    "we thus conclude that any solution to the linear problems ( [ lp5 ] ) , where the @xmath3-function obeys the hirota equation , provides an ( auto ) bcklund transformation , i.e. , a transformation that sends a solution of the nonlinear integrable equation to another solution of the same equation .",
    "let us rewrite the linear problems ( [ lp5 ] ) changing the order of the terms and shifting the variables : @xmath187 these equations are graphically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bt1 ] in the @xmath91-plane .",
    "they constitute the bcklund transformation @xmath188 in the bilinear form @xcite . given a family of polynomials @xmath46 obeying the hirota equation , one may pose the problem of finding polynomial solutions to equations ( [ linpr1 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that these equations are not compatible with the boundary conditions for @xmath189 and @xmath46 of the  fat hook \" type with the same @xmath9 and @xmath10 . indeed",
    ", applying these equations in the corner point of the interior boundary , one sees that if @xmath190 for @xmath3 and @xmath180 are the same , then the boundary values must vanish identically .",
    "however , it is straightforward to verify that equations ( [ linpr1 ] ) are compatible with the boundary conditions of the following two types : @xmath191 or @xmath192 they are again of the  fat hook \" type but with the shifts @xmath193 or @xmath194 .",
    "we refer to the corresponding transformations as @xmath195 and @xmath196 : @xmath197 for ( [ bcondf1 ] ) and @xmath198 for ( [ bcondf1a ] ) .",

    ". the same formulas ( [ linpr1 ] ) define inverse transformations @xmath199 and @xmath200 if one treats them as linear equations for @xmath3 with given @xmath180 . in a more explicit way",
    ", the transformations @xmath201 , @xmath202 are defined by formulas ( [ lp531b ] ) , ( [ lp531a ] ) below .    repeating these transformations several times",
    ", we arrive at the hierarchy of functions @xmath203 ( @xmath204 , @xmath205 ) such that :    * they obey the hirota equation in @xmath150 for any @xmath115 ; * they are connected by the bcklund transformations [ backlund ] + l t_k-1,m(a , s , u)=_1 ^ -(t_k , m(a , s , u ) ) , +   + t_k , m-1(a , s , u)=_2",

    "the levels of the hierarchy are labeled by the pair of numbers @xmath115 .",
    "the lowest level is @xmath212 while the highest one is @xmath190 .",
    "we shall say that the @xmath3-functions @xmath203 belong to the level @xmath115 .",
    "it is important to note that the parameter @xmath156 involved in the definition of the bcklund transformations can be different for transformations of the two types introduced above as well as for successive transformations of the same type .",
    "we choose these parameters to be eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath41 : @xmath125 for the transition @xmath213 and @xmath128 for @xmath214 .",
    "more precisely , the transformation @xmath195 is written in the form @xmath215 while @xmath216 in the form @xmath217 ( @xmath218 , @xmath219 ) . if one ignores the @xmath28-dependence ( which disappears in the @xmath73 limit ) , then these formulas become the bilinear relations between characters mentioned in section 3 ( see equations ( [ ch8 ] ) and comments after them ) .",
    "it is easy to notice that each of the equations in ( [ linprt1 ] ) , ( [ linprt2 ] ) is actually a dynamical equation for a function of three variables rather than five .",
    "for example , the first equation in ( [ linprt1 ] ) acts in the subspaces @xmath220 and @xmath221 . upon restriction to the corresponding three - dimensional hyperplanes in the linear space with coordinates @xmath222 , each of these equations can be put in the standard hirota form by a linear change of variables .    for completeness ,",
    "let us give a symmetric description of the bcklund transformations through the matrix equations of the form ( [ lp531 ] ) .",
    "for the direct and inverse transformations we need to introduce two antisymmetric @xmath223 matrices @xmath224 of the type ( [ lp53 ] ) : [ lp54 ] ^ ( ) ( a , s , u)= (    cccc 0 & t(a , s , u - ) & - t(a , s + , u ) & t(a + , s , u ) + & & & + -t(a , s , u - ) & 0 & t(a - , s , u ) & t(a , s - , u ) + & & & + t(a , s + , u ) & - t(a - , s , u ) & 0 & -t(a , s , u + ) + & & & + -t(a + , s , u ) & - t(a , s - , u ) & t(a , s , u + ) & 0    ) where @xmath225",

    "moreover , a careful analysis of the equations ( [ linprt1])-([lp531a ] ) shows that boundary values of the @xmath3-functions at each level @xmath115 are subject to the same relations as at the highest level . on the exterior boundaries , the @xmath3-functions have the specific form similar to ( [ t3 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath231 is a function of @xmath232 while @xmath233 is the same function of @xmath234 .",
    "let us introduce the special notation for them : [ q ] t_k , m(0,s , u)=q_k , m(u - s ) , t_k , m(a,0,u)=q_k , m(u+a ) .",
    "the polynomials @xmath235 play a very important role .",
    "they will be identified with eigenvalues of baxter s @xmath7-operators .",
    "the polynomial @xmath236 is a fixed input data which determines the model .",
    "the polynomials @xmath235 at lower levels are to be found in the course of solution . in analogy with ( [ f13 ] ) , we fix their highest coefficients to be @xmath23 . applying ( [ linprt1 ] ) , ( [ linprt2 ] ) on the interior boundaries ,",
    "we conclude that if ( [ ident ] ) is valid at the highest level , then @xmath3-functions on the interior boundaries at each level @xmath115 are connected by a similar relation : @xmath237 the matrix @xmath238 is defined in ( [ gkmdiag ] ) and @xmath239 .",
    "we see now that by applying @xmath195 and @xmath216 to a solution of the hirota equation in the domain @xmath146 with the boundary conditions ( [ bcond1 ] ) , we can successively transform it to the trivial solution in the degenerate domain @xmath240 . this ",
    "undressing procedure \" allows one to construct solutions to the original problem , as it will be shown below .",
    "the bcklund transformations from the previous section can be reformulated in the operator form as recurrence relations for difference operators of infinite order .",
    "let us consider the following operator : [ r1 ] w(u)=_s0 e^2s_u ( the common denominator is introduced for normalization ) .",
    "it serves as a non - commutative generating series for the @xmath3-functions @xmath65 .",

    "it is the generating series for the functions @xmath241 .",
    "clearly , @xmath242 ( recall that @xmath243 unless @xmath59 and @xmath244 ) .",
    "we also note that the series formally inverse to ( [ r2 ] ) generates the @xmath3-functions @xmath245 : [ r2a ] w^-1_k , m(u)= _",
    "a0(-1)^a e^2a_u . for",
    "the proof , see @xcite .",
    "set [ r3 ] x_k , m(u)=x_k , [ r4 ] y_k , m(u)=y_m . using the linear problems at @xmath58 , it is a straightforward calculation to prove the following recurrence relations for the operators @xmath246 : [ r5 ]    l w_k-1 , m(u)=(1-x_k , m(u)e^2_u ) w_k , m(u ) , +   + w_k , m+1(u)=(1-y_k , m+1(u)e^2_u ) w_k , m(u ) .",
    "these formulas are operator ( and @xmath28-dependent ) analogs of ( [ rec ] ) . the shift operator @xmath247 plays the role of the variable @xmath79 while the variable @xmath28 is absent in ( [ rec ] ) .",
    "notice also that @xmath248 , @xmath249 turn into @xmath250 , @xmath251 in the limit @xmath73 .",
    "here we present some details of the proof ( see also @xcite , where a slightly different version of the recurrence relations is proved ) .",
    "consider the first relation .",
    "we have : [ a1 ] w_k-1,m(u)-w_k , m(u)= _ s0e^2s_u . to transform the expression in the square brackets , we rewrite the first equation in ( [ linprt1 ] ) at @xmath58 in the form @xmath252 and continue the equality : [ a2 ] w_k-1,m(u)-w_k , m(u)=- x_k , m(u)_s0 e^2s_u . because @xmath253 , the sum in right hand side can be written in the form @xmath254 and the first recurrence relation is proved .",
    "the proof of the second one is completely similar .",
    "the recurrence relations established in the previous section allow one to represent the operator generating series ( [ r1 ] ) in a closed factorized form , where each factor contains the @xmath7-functions only .",
    "namely , @xmath255 can be obtained as a result of successive application of the recurrence relations ( [ r5 ] ) to @xmath242 . in this way , moving first in the @xmath256-direction from @xmath257 to @xmath258 and then in the @xmath259-direction from @xmath258 to @xmath260 , we get : [ b1 ] w_k , m(u)=_kk1^ ( 1-x_k , m(u)e^2_u)^-1 _ mm 1^ ( 1-y_0,m(u)e^2_u ) where the ordered product is defined as @xmath261 applying the recurrence relations in the different order ( @xmath259-direction first , @xmath256-direction next ) , we arrive at a different but equivalent representation : [ b2 ] w_k , m(u)=_mm1^ ( 1-y_k , m(u)e^2_u ) _ kk 1^ ( 1-x_k,0(u)e^2_u)^-1 .",
    "in fact one can apply the relations ( [ r5 ] ) in any other order determined by a chosen zigzag path from the point @xmath257 to the point @xmath260 .",
    "each step in the @xmath259-direction , @xmath262 , brings the factor @xmath263 while each step in the @xmath256-direction , @xmath264 , brings the factor @xmath265 which are to be multiplied according to the order of the steps .",
    "this yields many other ways to factorize the operator @xmath255 .",
    "their equivalence follows from the compatibility of the recurrence relations ( [ r5 ] ) which is expressed by the discrete  zero curvature \" condition [ zc ] ( 1-y_k-1,m+1(u)e^2_u ) ( 1-x_k , m(u)e^2_u)= ( 1-x_k , m+1(u)e^2_u ) ( 1-y_k , m+1(u)e^2_u ) on the @xmath266-lattice .",
    "the two sides of this equality correspond to two different ways to obtain @xmath267 from @xmath268 .",
    "the equalities ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) as well as the similar equalities with different orderings are generalized baxter s @xmath8-relations in a generating form .",
    "equating coefficients in front of different powers of the operator @xmath269 , one obtains expressions for the @xmath3-functions @xmath270 through @xmath271 , @xmath272 and thus through the @xmath7-functions @xmath235 with @xmath273 , @xmath274 .",
    "for example , the simplest @xmath8-relation contained in ( [ b1 ] ) has the form [ b3 ] = _ k=1^kx_k , m(u)- _",
    "m=1^my_0,m(u ) , where @xmath275 , @xmath276 are to be expressed through the @xmath7-functions according to ( [ r3 ] ) , ( [ r4 ] )",
    ". the zeros of the latter are to be constrained by the system of bethe equations derived in the next section .",
    "our starting point in this section is the discrete zero curvature condition ( [ zc ] ) . comparing coefficients in front of different powers of the shift operator",
    ", we note that @xmath277 holds identically , and thus get the only non - trivial relation @xmath278 which after the substitution ( [ r3 ] ) , ( [ r4 ] ) becomes a functional equation for the @xmath7-functions . as a simple calculation shows , it is equivalent to the following bilinear equation ( the  @xmath11-relation \" @xcite ) : @xmath279 for the polynomial functions [ r6 ] q_k , m(u)=_j=1^n_k , m ( u - u_j^(k , m ) )",
    ".    let us remark that the @xmath11-relation ( [ qhirota ] ) can be recast to the standard form of the hirota bilinear difference equation in  chiral \" variables @xmath280 by passing to the function [ calq ] q_k , m(u)=a_k , me^(_k + _ m ) u q_k , m(u ) , where the new parameters @xmath281 and @xmath282 are related to the @xmath250 , @xmath251 by the formulas [ r8 ] x_k = e^2(_k -_k-1 ) , y_m = e^2(_m-1-_m ) .",
    "they are fixed uniquely by putting @xmath283 .",
    "this transformation eliminates the coefficients @xmath250 , @xmath251 in ( [ qhirota ] ) ( as well as in ( [ r3 ] ) , ( [ r4 ] ) ) and , with a proper choice of @xmath284 , the @xmath11-relation acquires the coefficient - free form @xmath285 suggested in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11-relation ( [ qhirota ] ) provides the easiest and the most transparent way to derive bethe equations for roots of the polynomials @xmath235 .",
    "putting @xmath28 in ( [ qhirota ] ) successively equal to the roots of each @xmath7-function entering the equation , one obtains a number of relations which , after some rearranging , can be written in the form    @xmath286    @xmath287    @xmath288    @xmath289    they hold inside the @xmath290 rectangle in the @xmath266-lattice and serve as elementary building blocks for systems of bethe equations .",

    "it should be noted that the solution is not unique .",
    "given boundary conditions , there is a finite set of solutions corresponding to different quantum states of the generalized spin chain .",
