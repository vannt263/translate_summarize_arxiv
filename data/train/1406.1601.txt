    "suppose that two distant parties alice and bob share an entangled state @xmath0 , but they need the other state such that the subsystems of @xmath0 are exchanged ( i.e. @xmath3 with @xmath2 being a swap operator ) .",
    "is it possible for them to swap a given @xmath0 by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) ?",
    "this problem , first considered by horodecki _ et .",
    "@xcite , is quite interesting , because it is closely related to the asymmetry of quantum entanglement . indeed ,",
    "if the entanglement contained in @xmath0 is asymmetric and the amounts of the entanglement of @xmath0 and @xmath4 are not equal ( in some entanglement measure ) , we can immediately conclude that @xmath0 can not be swapped by locc , because the amount of entanglement can not be increased by locc @xcite . in ref @xcite",
    ", it has also been shown that the entangled states which can be swapped by locc can be swapped by a local unitary transformation .",
    "this implies that the entangled state @xmath0 whose reduced density matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 have different eigenvalues can not be swapped by locc , and therefore almost all entangled states cannnot be swapped by locc .",
    "however , this is the case where a deterministic locc transformation with a unit probability is considered .",
    "as shown later , such states can also be generally swapped by stochastic locc ( slocc ) , and therefore by examining the success probability , it becomes possible to quantitatively discuss the degree of difficulty of swapping .",
    "for example , it can be said that the state having the smallest swapping probability is the most difficult state to swap , and it is expected that the entanglement of the state is the most asymmetric .    in this paper , we numerically calculate the swapping probability under positive partial transposed ( ppt ) operations @xcite , which are known to contain locc . concretely , we obtain the maximal @xmath7 for given @xmath0 among trace - nonincreasing ppt operations @xmath8 such that @xmath9 . as a result",
    ", we provide the numerical evidence for the special class of states whose swapping probability is the smallest among every state in two quantum bits ( qubits ) .",
    "moreover , we discuss why the class of states exhibits the small swapping probability .",
    "to begin with , we show some specific examples of the swap by slocc .",
    "when @xmath0 is not entangled , it can be clearly swapped by slocc with a unit probability , because @xmath4 is not entangled and can be generated by locc from the scratch .",
    "when @xmath0 is an entangled pure state @xmath10 , it can be also swapped with a unit probability , because @xmath10 can always be written in the schmidt decomposed form : @xmath11 and hence the difference between alice and bob is only the local bases ( the swap is thus achieved by a local unitary transformation exchanging the local bases ) . in the other cases of entangled mixed states ,",
    "the swapping probability becomes smaller than 1 in general .",
    "for example , let us consider the mixed state @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15",
    ". for later convenience , let us summarize the properties of @xmath16 here .",
    "the concurrence of @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 and the purity is given by @xmath18 the reduced density matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 are @xmath21 from the above , the absolute value of the difference of the purity of @xmath19 and @xmath20 is given by @xmath22    now , the optimal ( maximal ) swapping probability @xmath23 of @xmath16 by slocc is as follows :    * for @xmath24 or @xmath25 , @xmath26 because @xmath16 is pure or not entangled . * for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the swap is realized by an slocc @xmath8 as @xmath30 with @xmath31 because @xmath32 .",
    "the proof of the optimality is given by appendix a. it is interesting that @xmath23 is independent of @xmath33 for @xmath34 . * for @xmath27 and @xmath35 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath36 from the symmetry .    in this way",
    ", the state @xmath16 can be swapped with some finite probability even when it can not be swapped by deterministic locc .",
    "in fact , as shown in sec . [ s4 ] below , numerical results indicate that , in the limit of @xmath37 , @xmath23 is actually a lower bound for the swapping probability of _ any _ state of the same concurrence .",
    "however , @xmath23 changes discontinuously to @xmath38 at @xmath24 and @xmath25 as shown in fig . 1 ( see sec . [ s5 ] for further discussion of this point ) .",
    "locc is the most important class of operations in entanglement manipulations , but the mathematical treatment is quite difficult . indeed , obtaining the optimal swapping probability for general states is a quite hard task even numerically .",
    "note that , the maps of having a restricted form @xmath39 is sometimes considered as slocc ( e.g. @xcite ) , but in our case to obtain the optimal swapping probability , we need to consider the most general form of slocc such as @xmath40 with @xmath41 ( though this is indeed the form of trace - nonincreasing separable operations ) . in this paper , therefore , we numerically investigate it under positive partial transposed ( ppt ) operations @xcite .",
    "the states whose density matrices are kept positive despite partial transposition are called ppt states in association with peres separability criterion @xcite , and the operations which transform ppt states into ppt states are ppt operations . since ppt operations are slightly less constrained than locc , the swapping probability by stochastic ppt operations is equal to or higher than the probability by slocc",
    ". therefore , the swapping probability of unentangled states and pure states also reaches 1 . from the results of numerical calculations",
    ", it is found that the optimal swapping probability of the mixed state @xmath16 by ppt operations is also given by fig . 1 .    for general state @xmath0 ,",
    "the swapping probability is obtained as follows . from the so - called jamiokowski isomorphism @xcite ,",
    "let us denote @xmath42 as the isomorphic matrix to ppt operations @xmath8",
    "( i.e. @xmath43 with @xmath44 being a maximally entangled state between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) . in order for @xmath8 to be ppt operations",
    ", @xmath42 must fulfill the following conditions .",
    "* @xmath47 , because @xmath8 is a completely positive map .",
    "* @xmath48 , because @xmath8 transforms ppt states into ppt states , where @xmath49 denotes the partial transposition with respect to the subsystem @xmath50 .",
    "* @xmath51 , because @xmath8 is a trace - nonincreasing map , where @xmath52 .",
    "* @xmath53 must hold when the swapping probability is @xmath7 , because @xmath54 is transformed as @xmath55 .    the optimal swapping probability under ppt operations is then obtained by maximizing @xmath7 under the constrains ( a)-(d ) .",
    "this is a semidefinite programming problem @xcite .",
    "we numerically calculated the optimal probability @xmath7 for random density matrices in two qubits ( @xmath56 ) as follows .",
    "first , we generated the eigenvalues of a density matrix @xmath57 uniformly distributed under @xmath58 ( in the case where the rank of the density matrix is 4 ) @xcite .",
    "second , we generated a @xmath59 random unitary matrix according to @xcite , where a numerical method to generate random unitary matrices with the haar measure ( thus representative for circular unitary ensemble ) is provided .",
    "we then obtained a random density matrix by applying the unitary transformation to the diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are @xmath57 .",
    "finally , we solved the semidefinite programming problem for this density matrix numerically using the computer code @xcite to find the optimal @xmath7 .",
    "figure 2 shows the relationship between the optimal swapping probability @xmath7 and the concurrence @xmath60 .",
    "the results for 20,000 random density matrices are plotted in each case of rank 2 , 3 , and 4 . from this figure",
    ", it turns out that @xmath7 is bounded below by a nonzero probability .",
    "this implies that almost all states can be swapped with a non - vanishing probability by ppt operations .",
    "moreover , it turns out from the figure that the lower bound of @xmath7 increase as @xmath60 increases . in order to investigate this lower bound ,",
    "let us consider the optimal swapping probability @xmath23 of the mixed state @xmath16 . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] , @xmath23 is independent on @xmath33 but the concurrence of @xmath16 becomes maximum when @xmath61 , because @xmath16 approaches to the pure state of @xmath10 in this limit .",
    "namely , when @xmath61 , @xmath16 has as high entanglement as the pure state , but the swapping probability remains @xmath62 .",
    "the curve in fig .",
    "2 shows the relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath63 in the limit of @xmath61 , and our numerical results strongly suggest that the swapping probability is lower bounded by this curve .",
    "it is quit interesting that this is an open bound because the curve is reached only when @xmath64 .",
    "note that a similar result is obtained for the other entanglement measure of negativity .",
    "figure 3 shows the relationship between the optimal swapping probability @xmath7 and the purity .",
    "note that , when the purity is less than or equal to 1/3 , there are no entangled states @xcite , and hence @xmath65 in this region .",
    "when the purity is greater than or equal to 1/2 , @xmath7 distributes from @xmath66 to @xmath38 , and there is no nonzero lower bound .",
    "this is because the state @xmath16 , whose purity is determined by @xmath33 only and takes a value in [ 1/2 , 1 ) , gives a vanishing swapping probability in the limit of @xmath67 .",
    "when the purity is less than 1/2 , however , the state @xmath16 is absent because the states of rank 2 , including @xmath16 , can not take the purity less than 1/2 . in this region , it is found from the figure that @xmath7 has a nonzero lower bound .",
    "this fact also supports that the swapping probability of @xmath16 is particularly low because @xmath7 is considerably raised by the absence of @xmath16 . in this region",
    ", we found that the lower bound is given by the following state @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , the numerically obtained swapping probability of @xmath68 in the limit of @xmath67 shown by a curve in fig .",
    "3 clearly lower bounds all the data points for random density matrices . note that the state @xmath68 coincides with @xmath16 at @xmath72 .",
    "[ tb ]    figure 4 shows the relationship between the swapping probability @xmath7 and the absolute value of the difference of the purity of the reduced density matrices ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "only when @xmath74 , the optimal swapping probability reaches 1 , which reproduces the result by horodecki _ et .",
    "_ @xcite . as in the case of fig .",
    "3 , there is no nonzero lower bound , which is again explained by the optimal swapping probability of @xmath16 in the limit of @xmath67 , because @xmath75 can take any value within the range of @xmath76 [ see eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) ] .",
    "figure 4 also shows that the upper bound of @xmath7 exists and decreases with the increase of @xmath73 .",
    "the swapping probabilities of the states @xmath16 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 upper bound all the data points ( except for a few points of rank 3 , which probably originate from the instability of the numerical calculations ) .",
    "in this paper , we performed numerical calculations to study how the optimal probability of swapping a state by ppt operations is related to the amount of the entanglement ( concurrence and negativity ) . as a result",
    ", we numerically showed that almost all states in two qubits can be swapped with nonzero probability , and the lower bound of the optimal swapping probability increases for increasing the entanglement .",
    "in particular , we showed that the lower bound approaches to zero in the limit of vanishing entanglement .",
    "this is somewhat surprising because unentangled states can always be swapped with a unit probability .",
    "moreover , numerical results strongly suggest that the lower bond corresponds to the swapping probability of the state @xmath16 in the limit of @xmath64 .",
    "namely , this state is the most difficult state to swap among the states which have the same amount of entanglement in two qubits .",
    "why is the state @xmath16 extremely difficult to swap ? the reason is not so clear but this state , the mixture of the pure entangled states @xmath10 and @xmath79 , has relatively high entanglement . in order to swap this state , however , we are subject to the strong constraint that @xmath79 must be transformed to @xmath80 , even if the portion of @xmath79 is infinitesimally small ( see appendix a ) . as a result , @xmath16 has the special property that the optimal swapping probability is fully discontinuous around @xmath81 , i.e. the probability drops from 1 to 0 by the infinitesimal change of @xmath33 .      obviously , this discontinuity originates from the fact that we considered the exact transformation . if we consider the approximate transformation where the target state @xmath82 is allowed to have a small margin @xmath83 such that @xmath84 ( @xmath85 is the trace distance ) , the discontinuity is smeared out .",
    "indeed , in this approximate scheme , we have to do nothing to swap for @xmath16 with @xmath86 , hence @xmath87 and the discontinuity at @xmath88 is resolved .",
    "however , even in this case , @xmath7 again approaches to @xmath62 for @xmath89 as shown in fig .",
    "5 , and the concurrence is still as high as @xmath90 . therefore ,",
    "the curve of fig .",
    "2 is only slightly shifted to the left ( for small @xmath83 ) and our conclusion is not changed critically .",
    "we also studied how the swapping probability is related to the mixedness , and showed that the lower bound ( @xmath91 for a purity larger than 1/2 ) is again explained by the state @xmath16 ( in the limit of @xmath67 ) . therefore , @xmath16 is the most difficult state to swap in this sense also .",
