    "landau damping is one of the most fundamental phenomena of waves in plasma physics .",
    "such collisionless damping was first theoretically predicted by landau @xcite and later experimentally verified by malmberg and wharton @xcite . since then",
    ", landau damping of electrostatic or electromagnetic waves in plasmas has been a topic of important research ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "however , in most of these investigations landau damping has been considered classically , i.e. , using the vlasov - poisson system and/or limited to the linear theories .",
    "when quantum effects are included there appear new length scale and new coupling parameter , as well as new collective modes for which new processes come into play .",
    "for example , the modifications of the linear landau damping of electrostatic waves by the effects of arbitrary degeneracy of electrons @xcite , and the influence of linear landau damping on nonlinear waves @xcite in quantum plasmas .",
    "although , there are some developments of landau damping in nonlinear regimes ( see , e.g. , refs . ) , however , many of the effects of nonlinear landau damping have not yet been explored , especially in the quantum regime .",
    "recently , chatterjee and misra @xcite advanced the nonlinear theory of landau damping @xcite of electrostatic wave envelopes in an electron - positron ( ep ) pair plasma in the context of tsallis nonextensive statics .",
    "starting from a set of vlasov - poisson equations and using a multiple scale technique , they have shown that the nonextensive parameter significantly modifies the landau damping rates , the modulational instability ( mi ) , as well as the evolution of wave envelopes .    in the present work",
    ", we consider the wigner - moyal equation , which accounts for the particle dispersion , and excludes the exchange - correlation and spin effects .",
    "specifically , we focus on the weak quantum regime in which the langmuir wavelength @xmath2 is larger than the thermal de broglie wavelength of electrons and positrons @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the reduced planck s constant , @xmath6 is the mass of electrons / positrons and @xmath7 is the thermal velocity with @xmath8 denoting the boltzmann constant and @xmath9 the particle s thermodynamic temperature .",
    "such weak quantum effects in the nonlinear regime can lead to , e.g. , bounce - like amplitude oscillations even in absence of trapped particles @xcite .",
    "starting from the wigner - moyal equation coupled to the poisson equation and using a multiple scale technique ( mst ) , we derive a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , which governs the evolution of electrostatic wave envelopes ( wes ) in quantum ep plasmas .",
    "we show that in the weak quantum regime , the resonant particles still have a velocity close to the group velocity of the wes as in the classical theory @xcite , and the coefficients of the nls equation , including the nonlocal nonlinearity due to the wave - particle resonance , are significantly modified by the quantum dispersion .",
    "we also find that , not only the wave dispersion and the landau damping rate are modified , the mi as well as the decay rate of wes are also greatly influenced by the quantum effect .",
    "we consider the nonlinear propagation of electrostatic waves in an unmagnetized collisionless quantum electron - positron - pair plasma .",
    "such ion - free ep - pair plasmas with unique characteristics have recently been produced in the laboratory@xcite .",
    "our starting point is the wigner - moyal distribution function @xmath10 for electrons @xmath11 and positrons @xmath12 which satisfies the following evolution equation @xmath13f_{\\alpha}(x , v_0 , t)=0 , \\label{wigner - eq - moyal } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the charge and mass of @xmath16-species particles , @xmath17 is the velocity and @xmath18 is the self - consistent electrostatic potential satisfying the poisson equation @xmath19 note that eq .",
    "includes the particle dispersive effects but ignores the exchange - correlation and spin effects .",
    "we focus on the long - wavelength perturbations with characteristic length scale @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the typical debye length with @xmath22 denoting the equilibrium number density , and @xmath23 the oscillation frequency of electrons and positrons .",
    "this assumption requires the smallness of the nondimensional parameter @xmath24 .    in order to obtain the evolution equation for the electrostatic wes in ep plasmas",
    ", we follow refs . and so , introduce the multiple space - time scales as @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are coordinates stretched by a small parameter @xmath29 . since the wave amplitude is infinitesimally small so for @xmath30 a slight deviation @xmath31 from the uniform initial sate will occur .",
    "thus , we expand @xmath32 , \\\\   & \\phi(x , t)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\epsilon^{n } \\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\phi^{(n)}_l(\\eta,\\sigma,\\zeta ) \\exp[il(kx-\\omega t ) ] , \\label{expansion }   \\end{split } \\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the carrier wave frequency ( number ) of perturbations and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the reality conditions to hold .",
    "note that the expansion and the stretched coordinates @xmath36 ( not considered here ) are usually used in the reductive perturbation technique for the derivation of , e.g. , the nls equation .",
    "however , it has been shown by ichikawa _",
    "_ @xcite that the direct application of the reductive perturbation technique with the expansion to the vlasov - poisson system does not determine uniquely the contributions of resonant particles having group velocity of the wave @xmath37 . in order to give a proper account of this resonance ,",
    "ichikawa @xcite proposed a new multiple space - time scale with further expansions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in terms of fourier - laplace integrals .",
    "so , the components @xmath38 and @xmath39 are further expanded as @xmath40 \\\\",

    "it has been found that for high - frequency langmuir waves , the contribution of the exchange effects in the linear dispersion relation is relatively small with @xmath235 @xcite .",
    "however , in the nonlinear regime , even though its contribution will still scale as @xmath233 , the factor @xmath234 may or may not be smaller than the unity .",
    "furthermore , dealing with exchange effects in the nonlinear regime requires a challenging task both from computational and numerical points of view , and thus remains a project for future study .",
    "other important aspects , which we have limited in this work , could be the influence of the particle dispersion in the strong quantum regime where @xmath236 is not small .",
    "further to mention that in the limit of @xmath237 , where @xmath238 is the fermi temperature , while the pauli blocking mechanism reduces , the collisional effects between the charged particles may increase . in principle , one can add a collisional operator ( e.g. , coulomb collision ) to the semiclassical vlasov equation similar to the vlasov - poisson system , however , it may not be easy to include so in the wigner or wigner - moyal equation .",
    "nevertheless , inclusion of such collisional term contributes to the nls equation as a linear damping - like term which may be comparable to or smaller than the term @xmath239 associated with the linear landau damping rate @xmath240 . in the present analysis , the nonlocal nonlinearity ( which violates the conservation laws associated with the ordinary nls equation ) , due to the nonlinear resonance ( with the group velocity of the wave ) , dominates the dissipative mechanism over those produced by the collisional and linear landau damping effects .",
    "furthermore , we have considered the time scale @xmath241 which is much longer than the bounce period of trapped particles @xmath242 , the coulomb collision rate ) .",
    "so , to some extent , it is safe to neglect the collision effects in the present model .    to conclude",
    ", our results will be equally well - applicable to other pair plasmas or electron - ion plasmas where ions are treated classical , as one can simply recover the results by the adjustment of some factors in the relevant expressions .",
