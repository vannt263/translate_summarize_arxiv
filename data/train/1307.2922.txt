    "in the standard cosmological scenario initial dark matter ( dm ) density fluctuations are the seeds of the cosmic structures we observe today .",
    "gravitational instability amplifies these perturbations that trigger the collapse of the baryonic gas . at early times and on the large scales",
    "the dynamics of this process is linear .",
    "in contrast at late times and on small scales , as fluctuations grow sufficiently large , the gravitational collapse becomes highly non - linear .",
    "it is during this phase that dm particles eventually virialize into gravitationally bounded objects , the halos .    in the hierarchical bottom - up scenario low mass halos form",
    "earlier , while massive ones are assembled at later times through mergers of smaller mass halos and accretion of dm particles from the surrounding density field .",
    "a complete understanding of this regime is key to disclose the processes that shapes the distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "it is inside halos that cooling baryonic gas falls in to form the stars and galaxies that surround us .",
    "moreover , these carry cosmological information that can be tested through galaxy survey observations .    in the future a new generation of survey experiments will probe the nature of the invisible components in the universe through accurate measurements of the clustering of matter on an unprecedented range of scales .",
    "this calls for a major theoretical effort to provide reliable cosmological model predictions . however , because of the complexity of the gravitational collapse , cosmological studies of the dm clustering have mainly relied on numerical n - body simulations .",
    "numerous works have been dedicated to studying the imprint of dark energy on the non - linear cosmic structure formation . in this series of papers",
    "we have studied the signature that de leave on the non - linear matter power spectrum and the halo mass function .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that de alters the non - linear clustering of dark matter at small scales in a very peculiar manner .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that de affects the linear growth of matter density fluctuations and on scales above the stable clustering regime the non - linear collapse carries an integrated record of the past linear evolution ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the study of the halo mass function in @xcite has shown that deviations from a universal multiplicity function strongly correlate with the critical density threshold and the virial density predicted by the spherical collapse model of the simulated cosmology . in this paper",
    "we specifically focus on the imprint of de on the density profile of dm halos .",
    "one remarkable result of n - body simulations studies is that dark matter halos , regardless of the mass or the characteristics of the underlying cosmological model , exhibit a universal density profile which can be described in terms of a two - parameter fitting formula , the so called navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite .",
    "the cosmology dependence is entirely encoded in the relation between the nfw parameters , that is the mass dependence of the concentration parameter .",
    "this provides a measure of the compactness of the halo as function of its mass , and has important observational implications , since measurements of the concentration of galaxy clusters can test cosmology and constrain the cosmological parameters .",
    "the mass and redshift dependence of the halo concentration has been studied in a vast literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies have focused on the @xmath6cdm cosmology , while @xcite first investigated the evolution of the concentration in non - standard dark energy models .",
    "their analysis has shown that variations of the concentration - mass relation as function of redshift are related to differences of the linear growth rate of the underlying dark energy cosmologies .",
    "more recently , @xcite have found the slope of the @xmath7 relation to be roughly identical in all models , while the normalization depends on the linear growth rate .",
    "although the emergence of a universal halo density profile is still not understood , a number of empirical studies have suggested that the dependence of the concentration on halo mass and indirectly the appearence of the nfw profile is well correlated with the mass accretion history of halos ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on",
    "the observational side measurements of the concentration in massive clusters are still far from providing conclusive results @xcite .",
    "one complication arises from the fact that massive halos may not be relaxed and consequently their profiles may not be smooth .",
    "in fact , it is not at all implausible that a large fraction of the most massive clusters consists of unrelaxed halos @xcite .",
    "though the profile may depart from the nfw formula ( or any other parametric form of the profile ) the mass distribution inside such halos still carry cosmological information .",
    "how can we access such information independently of the profile ? does dark energy leaves a distinctive signature on halos with perturbed density profiles ?",
    "it is the goal of the work presented here to answer these questions . using a set of numerical n - body simulations of different de cosmologies we perform a detailed study of the density profiles of dm halos . as a case study",
    ", we show that the fraction of halos which are poorly fit by the nfw varies substantially with cosmology . to make use of this effect we introduce the sparsity , an observable measure of the mass distribution in halos which is independent of the halo density profile .",
    "we find this to be weakly dependent on the total halo mass , while it carries a distinct imprint of dark energy .",
    "we show that on a sample of halos the average value of the sparsity is directly related to the halo mass function , thus providing a self - consistent cosmological test applicable to all halos independently of the shape of their profile .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ nsim ] we briefly describe the cosmological n - body simulations and the algorithms used to perform the numerical analysis ; in section [ fitnfw ] we discuss the halo profile fitting procedure and in section [ chi2 ] we present the results of the nfw analysis . in section [ spars ]",
    "we introduce the sparsity and discuss its relevant properties . in section [ cosmospar ]",
    "we describe its use as probe of cosmology and present our conclusions in section [ conclu ] .",
    "we use a subset of n - body simulations from the `` dark energy universe simulation series '' ( deuss ) and publicly available through the `` dark energy universe virtual observatory '' ( deuvo ) database . for more details on these simulations",
    "we refer the interested reader to dedicated sections in @xcite .",
    "these have been realized using the adaptive mesh refinement code ramses based on a multigrid poisson solver @xcite for gaussian initial conditions generated using the zeldovich approximation with mpgrafic code @xcite and input linear power spectrum from camb @xcite .",
    "all simulations have the same phase of the initial conditions .",
    "we consider two class of cosmological models .",
    "_ realistic _ models , with parameters calibrated against measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap )",
    "5-year data @xcite and luminosity distances to supernova type ia from the union dataset @xcite .",
    "these models include a standard flat @xmath6 cold dark matter cosmology ( @xmath6cdm - w5 ) and two quintessence scalar field models characterized by a ratra - peebles potential ( rpcdm - w5 , * ? ? ? * ) and supergravity inspired model ( sucdm - w5 , * ? ? ?",
    "_ toy _ models are flat cosmological models with different background expansion and linear growth of the density perturbations .",
    "we additionally require these models to have the same distribution of linear density fluctuations at @xmath8 , hence the same @xmath9 value .",
    "these include a large cosmological constant model ( l-@xmath6cdm ) with @xmath10 , a ratra - peebles quintessence model with large value of the slope of the scalar potential ( l - rpcdm ) and a cold dark matter scenario ( scdm * , the * symbol is to remind that the model parameter values assumed here differ from the scdm usually considered in the literature ; see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these are used only for the purpose of studying the physical imprint of the underlying cosmological model on the dark matter halo profile .",
    "we also consider two @xmath6cdm models best fitting wmap 1-year ( @xmath6cdm - w1 ) and 3-year data ( @xmath6cdm - w3 )",
    "which have nearly identical linear growth histories and mainly differ for the value of @xmath9 .",
    "for all models the reduced hubble constant is set to @xmath11 , apart @xmath6cdm - w3 for which @xmath12 .",

    "here , we compute a diagnostic of the dynamical state of halos as measured by the parameter @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the kinetic energy and @xmath24 is an estimate of the potential energy of the halo",
    ". values of @xmath25 are indicative of deviation from the virial theorem .",
    "for instance @xcite consider halos to be virialized if @xmath26 , while @xcite assume a more stringent criterion @xmath27 .",
    "other proxies used in combination with @xmath28 are the measure of the off - set between the peak density of the halo and its center of mass .    as pointed out in section  [ chi2 ] , while @xmath23 is unambigously defined in terms of the halo particles ( since it is given by the sum of the kinetic energy of all particles in the halo ) .",
    "in contrast @xmath24 is a non - local quantity which is usually estimated by computing the potential energy between pairs of particles in the halo .",
    "however , this only gives a lower limit to the total potential energy since there could be non - negligible contributions from particles residing in the surrounding density field or nearby halos .",
    "this implies that results may strongly depend on the halo detection algorithm or the virial selection criteria .    in the upper panel of figure  [ chi2vir_so_fof ]",
    "we plot the distribution of @xmath29-values as function of @xmath28 at @xmath8 for the so halos from the @xmath6cdm - w5 simulation with @xmath30 particles and @xmath31  h@xmath32 mpc boxlength .",
    "we can see that for the most massive halos ( @xmath33  h@xmath32  m@xmath34 ) @xmath29 is an increasing function of @xmath28 .",
    "if we assume halos to be virialized for @xmath26 then there is a non - negligible fraction of halos which are more than @xmath35 from nfw ( @xmath36 ) and deviates from the virial condition .",
    "instead if we consider the more stringent criterion @xmath27 the fraction reduces accordingly . in any case",
    "the correlation remains difficult to asses because of a large scatter .",
    "this is not the case of fof halos from the same simulation which are shown in the lower panel of figure  [ chi2vir_so_fof ] .",
    "here , a correlation between @xmath29 and @xmath28 clearly stands out for the most massive halos .",
    "we can see that a large fraction of them are more than @xmath35 from nfw ( @xmath37 ) while deviating from `` equilibrium '' even assuming a less conservative criterion @xmath26 .",
