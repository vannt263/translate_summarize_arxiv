    "the ever growing number of exoplanet discoveries and their detection statistics illustrate that the natural endpoint of a circumstellar disc is a planetary system @xcite . infrared observations of young stellar objects ( ysos ) are highly sensitive to small amounts of dust and numerous surveys have now established that discs are almost ubiquitous at early times and have a median lifetime of a few myr @xcite .",
    "this timescale provides a critical constraint on planet formation theories , but it is equally important to measure the dust and gas content of the discs in order to understand the diversity of exoplanetary systems .",
    "millimeter wavelength observations are the best way to measure disc dust masses as the continuum emission is optically thin and only mildly dependent on temperature .",
    "gas masses are harder to determine but the bulk of the disc mass is cold and molecular and is therefore best traced by rotational lines in the same wavelength range . the emission is weak at these long wavelengths , however , and the number of discs that have been detected is relatively small compared to infrared surveys .",
    "the situation is particularly acute for discs in regions that are older than @xmath6myr , which severely limits our understanding of disc evolution .",
    "the scuba-2 camera on the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) provides a unique combination of high sensitivity and large field of view at submillimetre ( @xmath7 m and @xmath0 m ) wavelengths that makes possible , for the first time , unbiased surveys of young stellar clusters for faint emission from protoplanetary discs on a comparable scale to spitzer space telescope surveys @xcite . here",
    ", we present the observations and analysis of a scuba-2 survey of the  cluster at @xmath0 m .    the cluster is named after its brightest member , an o9v star in a quadruple system and a member of the orion ob1b association . @xcite",
    "provide a detailed summary of its properties in the handbook of star forming regions .",
    "the salient features of the region for this work are as follows : it consists of several hundred ysos from substellar to over @xmath8 , with a distribution that is consistent with the salpeter imf , amounting to a total stellar mass of about @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "there is little nebulosity around the cluster and the reddening along the line of sight is small , e(b - v)@xmath10mag @xcite both suggesting that the natal molecular cloud has almost entirely dispersed .",
    "the cluster is too distant for a reliable hipparcos parallax and , as protostellar luminosity depends both on age and distance , both these quantities are uncertain and inversely correlated . in this work , we adopt the values from @xcite for the cluster age , @xmath11myr , and distance 420pc .",
    "based on the tightness of the cluster locus on a colour - magnitude diagram , the yso age spread is fairly small , @xmath12myr .    although  is considerably more distant than the younger ,",
    "well studied taurus and @xmath13ophiuchus star forming regions , it is one of the closest clusters in an intermediate evolutionary phase when discs are dispersing .",
    "further , as a member of the orion complex , it comprises part of the closest _ massive _ star forming region . indeed , for a range of reasons from the distribution of stellar associations to cosmochemistry , orion is considered a better analog of the solar birthplace .",
    "the relatively high stellar density partly mitigates the greater distance as most of the cluster sources lie within @xmath14 ( 3.5pc ) of each other and can be observed within a single scuba-2 field .",
    "we use the cluster membership as defined by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter h07 ) who surveyed the region with spitzer to identify point sources with characteristic optical - infrared colour of protostars .",
    "this list of 336 sources is complete to about @xmath15 .",
    "the fraction of stars with optically thick discs is @xmath16% , which is consistent for its estimated @xmath11myr age with the well characterised infrared disc lifetime plot @xcite .",
    "there is no significant difference in the spatial distribution of bright , higher mass stars or disc bearing stars relative to fainter , lower mass stars and discless stars .",
    "thus our scuba-2 map provides an essentially unbiased measure of the dust mass for a large sample of discs as they evolve from primordial to debris through the process of planet formation .",
    "the scuba-2 observations and followup interferometry are described in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the results are presented in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "although only a handful of discs are detected , several of these exhibit molecular line emission which suggests that the evolution of the dust and gas content are broadly correlated .",
    "we compare our data with millimetre surveys of other regions and discuss the implications for disc evolution and planet formation timescales in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , we summarise the paper in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we observed a circular region with diameter @xmath1 ( about the diameter of the full moon ) toward the  cluster at @xmath0 m .",
    "the data were taken in queue mode over numerous observing runs from october 2011 to january 2013 ( program ids : m11bh02a , m12ah02a , m12bh47a ; see table  [ tab : obslog ] ) in median ( jcmt band 3 ) weather conditions , defined by the zenith optical depths at 225ghz lying between 0.08 and 0.12 .",
    "this corresponds to precipitable water vapor levels @xmath17 mm and zenith optical depths at @xmath0 m @xmath18 .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 31 hours .",
    "the pointing center , ra=05:39:00.0 , dec=-02:33:00.0 , lies a couple of arcminutes northeast of the brightest cluster member , , and was chosen to maximize the number of infrared identified ysos in the map .",
    "the _ pong-1800 _ mapping mode was used to provide nearly uniform sensitivity over the large circular field .",
    "the data reduction was carried out at the joint astronomy center using the dynamic iterative map maker in the starlink / smurf software package @xcite .",
    "as there was expected to be little extended @xmath0 m emission and because we were most interested in discs around ysos , which would be point sources at the @xmath19 scuba-2 resolution , we used the blank field configuration for the map maker that is most commonly used for deep field extragalactic surveys .",
    "each night was reduced individually and the maps were then co - added with weights proportional to the inverse square of the map noise .",
    "the flux density scale was determined through regular observations of bright point sources , most commonly uranus , mars , and protoplanetary nebulae crl618 and crl2688 . following the recommended procedure in online documentation , we reduced these sources with the same ( blank field ) map maker configuration file to derive the flux calibration factor ( fcf ) .",
    "these produced a range of values , fcf @xmath20jypwbeam . with no clear trend on observation date , weather , or elevation .",
    "we therefore simply multipled the co - added map by the mean value , 715jypwbeam , and consider the derived flux densities to have a calibration uncertainty of 10% .",
    "this fcf is about 30% higher than the value derived for observations of bright or extended sources by @xcite due to the additional filtering that is carried out for blank fields . finally , we applied a matched beam filter to smooth the data and maximize the sensitivity to point sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : scubahist ] shows the final map and a histogram of flux densities .",
    "the rms of the central region of the map , covering a total of 938 square arcminutes is 2.9mjybeam .",
    "the noise increases toward the edges but has a usable area , within which we could make reliable detections , of 1329 square arcminutes and contains 297 known cluster members .",

    "we followed these up with interferometric observations on the submillimeter array ( sma ) in the @xmath21 m band .",
    "these provided a confirmation of the scuba-2 detections and extended the sed to slightly longer wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , the correlator was configured to observe the 230ghz @xmath22 transition of co ( and its isotopologues ) so we could also search for molecular gas emission .",
    "the first set of observations were short `` filler '' tracks that were carried out between queue scheduled programs .",
    "the second set were dedicated tracks ( program 2012a - h002 ) to observe four sources together , observed in excellent weather conditions , and produced much better visibility plane coverage and sensitivity .",

    "the combination of sensitivity and large sample size of this scuba-2 survey , covering a wide range of stellar masses , is essential to the statistical significance of what might seem an intuitively obvious result : as a young stellar region evolves and discs dissipate , the dust mass of the remaining discs with infrared excesses decreases .",

    "only 2 scuba-2 ysos have irac excesses that are greater than the median for class ii discs .",
    "furthermore , it is intriguing that the seds of 3 out of the 8 optically thick discs exhibit dips between @xmath107 m and @xmath33 m ( or more specifically a rising slope from @xmath108 m to @xmath33 m ; figure  [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "these transition disc signatures are generally quite rare , comprising about 15% of sed types in most clusters .",
    "other examples of massive discs with depleted inner regions in several myr - old star forming regions are j1604 - 2130 in upper scorpius @xcite , and the famous tw hya @xcite .",
    "the numbers are , as yet , too small to be statistically significant but it is tempting to speculate that the reasons for the gap and large outer disc reservoir are related .",
    "one possibility is a massive planet that produces enough torque on the outer disc to slow down disc accretion @xcite .",
    "looking ahead , the recently commissioned atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) provides the capability to survey hundreds of discs in many different star forming regions at an order of magnitude higher sensitivity in the line and continuum than the data presented here .",
    "the statistical positive signal of about 1mjy toward the class ii non - detections is well within alma s sensitivities , even for snapshot integrations .",
    "unless the mass distribution is bimodal , therefore , it should be able to detect most , if not all , class ii discs in .",
    "moreover , it provides subarcsecond imaging and therefore the ability to determine not only bulk masses but surface densities .",
    "ultimately such alma surveys of different regions will reveal the evolution of the solid and gas components of discs as a function of radius , stellar mass , and environment .",
    "these will provide the key inputs required for population synthesis models and understanding the diversity of exoplanetary systems .",
    "we have mapped 297 ( 88% ) of the known members of the  cluster at @xmath0 m .",
    "only 9 ysos were detected with inferred masses ranging from 5 to @xmath3 .",
    "the infrared seds of these sources exhibit a wide diversity suggesting that the evolution of their structural properties such as inner holes and flaring is largely independent of their bulk dust mass . based on a stacking analysis ,",
    "the mean mass of the 83 class ii ysos that were not individually detected is @xmath4 .",
    "we followed up 6 sources with spectroscopic observations and detected co emission toward 4 of them , suggesting that the gas remains broadly coupled with the dust as the discs dissipate .",
    "the general weakness of the emission in the @xmath11myr  discs illustrates how rapidly the amount of raw material available for planet formation decreases with time .",
    "whereas 27% of the cluster members have optically thick discs , the average mass of 90% of these discs is only about half a jupiter mass .",
    "this suggests a yet faster timescale for giant planet formation than the oft - used infrared lifetime plot .",
    "scuba-2 has proven to be an efficient survey instrument for large clusters to learn about the collective evolution of discs and as a finder telescope for followup interferometry . as alma begins millimetre wavelength surveys of the dust and gas content of protoplanetary discs we can expect more precise constraints on planet formation models .",
    "this work is supported by funding from the nsf through grant ast-1208911 .",
    "we thank remo tilanus for advice with the data reduction and the referee , jane greaves , for her comments .",

    "additional funds for the construction of scuba-2 were provided by the canada foundation for innovation .",
    "the submillimeter array is a joint project between the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and the academia sinica institute of astronomy and astrophysics and is funded by the smithsonian institution and the academia sinica .",
