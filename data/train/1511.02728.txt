    "a vast number of physical systems exhibit the property that some of their parts behave in a sort of classical way , meaning that quantum effects play only a minor role in the description of those parts .",
    "this distinctive classical character of specific degrees of freedom is a much welcomed attribute , for it makes possible the development of tractable computational approaches capable of carrying out the time - evolution of complex quantum systems , being thus the fundamental property upon which time - dependent trajectory - guided methods are based .    in this kind of technique quantum states",
    "are represented in terms of time - dependent basis functions or ` configurations ' . within a single configuration , those degrees of freedom in which quantum effects are negligible are evolved according to classical equations of motion .",
    "this classical dynamics may be prescribed in a number of different ways and different choices correspond to different propagation schemes .    in spite of the fact that individual configurations have some of their parts bound to obey classical laws ,",
    "a complete quantum solution is in principle attainable by combining many configurations .",
    "the key idea behind such ` multiconfigurational ' approaches is that trajectory - guided basis functions are more likely to remain in the important regions of the hilbert space , thus being more efficient at representing the quantum state in the sense that a reduced number of basis elements is required in order to achieve an accurate description . and it is precisely through a significant reduction in the number of basis functions needed to propagate the system that one hopes to escape the exponential scaling of basis - set size with dimensionality typical of standard static - basis formulations .",
    "this ` mixed quantum - classical ' picture is adopted in many methods of quantum chemistry . @xcite",
    "a recurrent theme in this field is the development of techniques which , by means of equally simple recipes to guide the basis functions , would be readily applicable to systems presenting authentically non - classical qualities , such as spin degrees of freedom or particle exchange symmetry .",
    "several works have been directed to that purpose , most often aiming at a time - dependent description of the electronic structure of molecules during non - adiabatic processes .",
    "one particular example of such a recipe is the classical model for electronic degrees of freedom proposed by miller and white @xcite in which a second - quantized fermionic hamiltonian is properly reduced to a classical function wherein number and phase variables play the role of generalized coordinates .",
    "in contrast , a more ` mechanistic ' approach to fermion dynamics is found on the multiconfigurational formula proposed by kirrander and shalashilin @xcite in which the basis functions consist of antisymmetrized frozen gaussians @xcite guided by fermionic molecular dynamics .",
    "@xcite    yet if one seeks to describe non - classical degrees of freedom by means of classical - like variables , then generalized coherent states  defined in the group - theoretical sense  are indisputably the most appropriate tools to be employed .",
    "there are many reasons supporting this assertion .",
    "first of all , coherent states are defined in terms of non - redundant parameters and equations of motion for these parameters can be readily obtained from the time - dependent variational principle .",
    "@xcite in this way an optimized time - evolution can be assigned in an unambiguous manner .",
    "moreover , they are naturally able to capture the desired symmetries of the system which are maintained during propagation .",
    "furthermore , the coherent - state parameters evolve in a classical phase space in the strict sense of the word , hence we automatically have at our disposal the wealth of analytical techniques applicable to hamiltonian systems . at the same time , through this intimate connection to classical dynamics , coherent states provide a compelling classical interpretation to quantum phenomena , in so far as individual configurations are chosen to represent familiar objects ",
    "i.e.  in such a way that it is meaningful to discuss the dynamics of the system in terms of their trajectories .",
    "to this extent , coherent states  which are also minimum uncertainty states ( provided a proper meaning is assigned to the term ` uncertainty ' ) @xcite  are valuable tools in enhancing our comprehension with respect to the semiclassical features of the quantum system under investigation .",
    "in addition , the group - theoretical formalism secures a well - defined integral form for the coherent - state closure relation @xcite  a crucial element to the developments hereby presented .",
    "this list of virtues is not exhausted and other advantages of a generalized coherent - state representation will be pointed out throughout the paper .",
    "along these lines , van voorhis and reichman @xcite have considered a number of alternative representations of electronic structure making use of different coherent - state parametrizations and also examined their adequacy to a variety of systems .",
    "@xcite within the context of non - adiabatic molecular dynamics , a particularly interesting coherent - state representation @xcite is found in the simplest and most throughly investigated version of the electron - nuclear dynamics theory , developed by deumens , hrn and collaborators .",
    "@xcite the same kind of coherent state has been discussed in detail , within the field of nuclear physics , by suzuki and kuratsuji .",
    "@xcite turning to bosonic dynamics , a semiclassical trajectory - based formula in the @xmath2 coherent - state representation has been recently derived and successfully applied to a model of trapped bosons .",
    "@xcite    these methods are representative of the kind of technique one has in mind when a description of intrinsically quantum degrees of freedom in terms of classical - like variables is desired .",
    "however , they either constitute approximate single - configuration approaches @xcite or involve complicated trajectories that live in a duplicated phase space , @xcite sometimes relying on sophisticated root - search techniques in order to determine them . @xcite it seems that a multiconfigurational , generalized coherent - state approach , based on simple  as opposed to duplicated  phase - space trajectories would be more in the spirit of the familiar time - dependent guided - basis methods of quantum chemistry .",
    "@xcite this is precisely the direction we take here .    in this work a quantum initial value representation method which employs a generalized coherent - state basis",
    "set guided by classical trajectories is formulated .",
    "the resulting propagation scheme is regarded as a natural extension of the coupled coherent states technique of shalashilin and child @xcite in so far as ( i ) basis - set elements represent localized quantum states ; ( ii ) each element evolves independently in a generalized classical phase space and carries an action phase ; and ( iii ) the quantum amplitudes associated with individual elements obey fully coupled equations of motion which present a number of attractive qualities .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : cs - formalism ] with an overview on generalized coherent states , deliberately avoiding the underlying group - theoretical formalism associated with their construction . in particular , we demonstrate how the time - dependent variational principle leads to classical equations of motion for the coherent - state parameters in a curved phase space . this preliminary discussion is illustrated with specific examples .",
    "next , in ",
    "[ sec : ccs - generalized ] , we set forth to derive the working equations of the generalized coupled coherent states method , first in continuum form and then in terms of a discrete basis set . in the latter case , both unitary and non - unitary versions of the formulas are devised .",
    "a primitive method , resulting from propagation of a single configuration , is also discussed . in ",
    "[ sec : ccs - application ] we use our approach to study model hamiltonians and compare our results against exact quantum data .",
    "we also take the opportunity to expose certain particular aspects of the generalized coherent - state formulation .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "coherent states are most elegantly discussed within the context of group theory and this is the point of view adopted here .",
    "we shall not venture into the group - theoretical formalism itself though  on that subject the reader is referred to the instructive review by zhang , feng and gilmore @xcite or to a recent paper by the present authors .",
    "@xcite here , we will rather follow a more pragmatic approach according to which a coherent state is given in the form of an expansion in a proper set of orthonormal states and work its geometrical properties thereon .",
    "coherent states are hilbert space vectors labeled by a complex vector @xmath3 . @xcite they can be understood as the result of a lie - group operator acting on a reference state , which is recovered by setting all entries of the vector @xmath4 to zero .",
    "we shall denote a non - normalized coherent state by @xmath5 .",

    "if the parametrization contains less than the number of variables needed to span the associated hilbert space , the resulting dynamics will be only approximate .",

    "one now can distinguish between two kinds of coupling between the components of the vector @xmath4 : a _ dynamical coupling _ via @xmath31 , and a _ geometrical coupling _ induced by @xmath30 .",

    "@xcite    furthermore , the measure is invariant under the classical dynamics given by equation , that is , @xmath32 , for any two instants @xmath33 and @xmath34  a property that we recognize as a generalized form of the liouville theorem and that remains valid even when the system s hamiltonian has an explicit time dependence .",

    "the derivatives with respect to each of these variables are :    [ eqn : action - derivatives ] @xmath42    the above relations are recognized as the signature of a properly defined classical action integral . @xcite",
    "yet it is in terms of the real quantity @xmath43 of eq . that our results are most conveniently expressed .",
    "@xcite therefore we shall denominate @xmath43 the _ action_.      in order to illustrate the formalism presented above , we consider simple examples of coherent states and evaluate some of their geometrical elements , such as the metric matrix @xmath30 and integration measure @xmath44 .      canonical coherent states have their functional definition given in terms of a superposition of bosonic fock states with _ unrestricted _ occupation numbers ; if the hilbert space comprises @xmath45 modes , then the non - normalized canonical coherent state is defined by : @xmath46      { | m_1 , \\ldots , m_n \\rangle},\\ ] ] where the vacuum @xmath47 is the reference state and the length of the vector @xmath4 equals the number of bosonic modes : @xmath48 .",

    "the normalized measure , as defined in , is then trivial : @xmath52    in what concerns semiclassical trajectory - based methods , canonical coherent states are undoubtedly the most widely used type of coherent state .",

    "although the content of the present paper encompasses all basic ingredients needed to implement the proposed method in terms of these states , a proper treatment would nevertheless require introduction of additional concepts .",
    "therefore , we do not pursue applications involving this particular set of coherent states in this paper .",
    "the coupled coherent states ( ccs ) method , as originally developed by shalashilin and child @xcite using canonical coherent states , belongs to the family of multiconfigurational guided - basis methods .",

    "let us make a few observations regarding this particular choice of solution .",
    "first , all quantities that specify @xmath25 ",
    "i.e.  @xmath8 , @xmath123 and @xmath122  are to be regarded as functions of the initial conditions @xmath124 .",
    "thus , the method is conceived as an initial value representation from its onset .",
    "second , we note that it follows from that @xmath123 depends on the initial state @xmath125 through the relation @xmath126 . in numerical applications ,",
    "the integral in has to be approximated somehow ; the typical procedure is to sample initial conditions @xmath124 in phase space with the overlap modulus @xmath127 playing the role of a weight function .",
    "once the @xmath124 s have been properly sampled , the values of the corresponding @xmath128 s are uniquely defined .",
    "third , the motivation behind the factorization of @xmath129 into a complex amplitude times an action exponential comes from a general result of semiclassical theory , according to which the classical action provides a first - order approximation to the phase of the quantum state . since this phase accounts for most of the wavefunction s oscillatory behavior , @xmath123 is expected to present a rather smooth time dependence , thus facilitating numerical treatment .",
    "we now proceed to look for a differential equation for @xmath123 . taking the time derivative of and making use of the schrdinger  equation ,",
    "we find ( after rearranging terms ) : @xmath130e^{-{\\frac{{i}}{\\hbar}}s(z)}.\\ ] ]    next , we factor out @xmath25 by separating the scalar products on the right - hand side of the equation with the help of the closure relation @xmath131 , with @xmath132 , which leads to @xmath133}.\\ ] ] here we have already shifted the integration measure to the initial instant [ @xmath134 and replaced the @xmath135 that appeared under the integral sign for @xmath136 .",
    "the coupling @xmath137 in is given by @xmath138 where the non - diagonal matrix element @xmath139{| z \\}}\\hat{h}\\ketn{z'}}{{\\ { z | z ' \\ } } }      = \\frac{{\\langle z |}\\hat{h}{| z ' \\rangle}}{{\\langle z | z ' \\rangle}},\\ ] ] is an analytical function of @xmath7 and @xmath140 that can be directly obtained by analytical continuation of the classical hamiltonian .",
    "as a last step , we express the first term in as a function of readily computable quantities . since @xmath141{| z \\}}$ ] we observe that : @xmath142 the total time derivative of @xmath143 is simply @xmath144,\\ ] ] while the remaining term involving @xmath145{| \\dot{z } \\}}$ ] can be written as @xmath146 owing to the the analyticity of @xmath6{| z \\}}$ ] on @xmath7 .",

    "@xmath41 can be determined from their initial values .",
    "once the amplitudes are known , we can reconstruct the quantum state with , reproduced below in terms of @xmath123 : @xmath148    the integro - differential equation  with @xmath137 given by",
    " relates directly to the canonical coherent states version of the ccs method and shares its attractive characteristics , namely : ( i ) in the semiclassical regime , according to the reasons mentioned earlier , the amplitude @xmath123 is expected to have a smooth time dependence ; ( ii ) because of the coherent - state overlap @xmath149 , the @xmath140 integral is localized around @xmath4 ; @xcite and ( iii ) the coupling between amplitudes of different basis elements is not only sparse but also non - diagonal , since the integrand is identically zero when @xmath150 .    as a final remark , we should note that , if one performs a series expansion of @xmath137 for small @xmath151 , one finds that this series begins with a second - order term . in the generalized coherent state case",
    "however , unlike the specific situation for canonical coherent states , this does not coincide with the second- and higher - order terms in the taylor series of @xmath152 .",
    "here we re - derive the ccs equations using a discrete set of coherent states as basis , as opposed to the continuous set employed in the previous section .",
    "we shall find that the discrete formulas do not differ from their analogue expressions in the canonical coherent state case .",
    "this is due to the fact that all information concerning distinct coherent - state geometries is codified in a number of key quantities , namely : the overlap , the phase - space metric and the classical equations of motion .",
    "each of these quantities participates in the same way in the working equations , regardless of the particular type of coherent state being used  incidentally",
    ", a most desirable feature for programming purposes , for it means that the core subroutines of the method are essentially independent of geometry . nevertheless , for the sake of consistency , we must review the discrete formulas , for they are the ones actually used in practice .",
    "the first step towards a discrete unitary formulation of the generalized ccs method is the assumption that one is able to write down a closure relation by employing a finite number of basis elements as below : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the size of the basis set .",
    "@xcite it suffices that this closure relation represents the identity operator only on the dynamically accessible part of the phase space and that it holds only during the time interval upon which the propagation takes place .    in order to properly represent the identity , the matrix @xmath155 in must satisfy the relation : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the _ overlap matrix_. this guarantees that we have a well - defined discrete coherent - state decomposition : @xmath158 in other words , @xmath159 must be sufficiently well - conditioned so that expressions involving its inverse @xmath155 remain numerically stable during the entire propagation .",
    "therefore , the basis - set initial conditions must be sampled in such a way as to ensure that this requirement is fulfilled .",
    "one such procedure , that results in a well - conditioned overlap matrix ( at initial time ) , is described in appendix [ sec : sampling ] .    yet",
    ", nothing prevents that an initially well - conditioned overlap matrix becomes singular at some later time  a notable weakness of time - dependent methods formulated with non - orthogonal basis sets.@xcite in the event that @xmath159 becomes singular , one should take appropriate measures before resuming the propagation . in this regard",
    ", a particularly interesting protocol has been proposed by habershon.@xcite the ` singularity problem ' , though , did not occur in the simple applications considered in this paper .",
    "upon these considerations , we introduce a discrete set of @xmath154 amplitudes @xmath160 as well as their corresponding action phases @xmath161 , writing : @xmath162 next , we proceed exactly as in  [ sub : ccs - continuum ] .",

    "this represents a critical shortcoming when studying more complex systems for which there are no exact numerical results  or experimental data  available for comparison ; for in those cases no precise statements about the system could be made based on ccs results alone .",
    "in this work we have formulated a multiconfigurational , trajectory - guided quantum propagation method whose distinctive quality consists in employing generalized coherent states as basis elements . in this sense ,",
    "the technique is seen as a natural extension of the coupled coherent states method of shalashilin and child @xcite whereupon frozen gaussians are replaced by more general configurations ; at the same time , the main features of the original ccs are retained : quantum amplitudes obey an integro - differential equation with sparse coupling and present a smooth time dependence , owing to their oscillatory behavior being partially compensated by the classical motion of the basis elements and their action phases .    as pointed out in  [ sec : cs - formalism ] , no deep understanding of group - theory concepts is necessary , neither to derive the basic equations of the method nor to implement it numerically  in fact , we have seen that all geometrical quantities that enter the formulas can be straightforwardly evaluated from the coherent - state overlap function alone and that the discrete versions of the working equations do not differ in overall structure from their analogue expressions in the original ccs approach .",
    "in  [ sec : ccs - generalized ] , three versions of the method have been devised : continuum , non - unitary and unitary .",
    "the continuum version most evidently displays the novel elements due to the non - euclidean geometry associated with the generalized coherent - states and it serves primarily as a starting point for a number of possible analytical approximations .",
    "the non - unitary version , in turn , might be understood as a direct attempt to reproduce the continuum formulas by reducing phase - space integrals into finite sums . the unitary version , meanwhile , is the standard form of the method , being the most adequate for the majority of practical applications .",
    "we have also briefly discussed one weakness of this last version of the method which is the ill - conditioning of the overlap matrix . in that respect ,",
    "we note that the basis - set sampling procedure that we propose  detailed in appendix [ sec : sampling ]  is more appealing than the techniques used in previous ccs applications , for it assures an initially well - conditioned overlap matrix and hence stability of the amplitude equation , at least for short time propagation .    in  [ sec :",
    "ccs - application ] , we have illustrated the general aspects of the proposed approach with applications to simple models of many - boson systems , described in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosonic coherent states .",
    "one particular aspect , namely , the choice of appropriate phase - space variables for either sampling of initial conditions or grid construction , is found to be of great importance  coordinates chosen for these purposes must somehow reflect the intrinsic geometry of the coherent state under consideration , otherwise only a poor representation of the system is obtained .",
    "moreover , the accuracy and efficiency of the method was established by comparing results against exact quantum calculations .",
    "excellent agreement was observed and , in the triple - well system examined in ",
    "[ sub : su3-triple - well ] , small discrepancies in the results were found to be correlated with energy non - conservation .",

    "[ sub : su2-double - well ] revealed that the ccs approach is best suited for describing the regime of large particle number , also identified as the semiclassical regime of that problem .",
    "this conclusion can in fact be extended for @xmath2 bosonic systems in general .",
    "the same goes for the observations concerning the computational advantages of the method ( over standard matrix diagonalization ) when the number of particles is large ; assertions which were made within the context of the triple - well problem .",
    "though we have exemplified the use of the method with @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosonic hamiltonians , we emphasize that the formulation presented is by no means limited to these types of systems  in addition to the @xmath277 fermionic coherent states discussed in  [ subsub : thouless - cs ] , other possible coherent - state parametrizations in terms of which the method could be readily implemented were referenced throughout  [ sec : introduction ] .",
    "furthermore , the conclusion put forth in  [ sec : ccs - application ] , namely , that propagation of quantum states with the help of classically guided basis sets is better suited for describing systems in their semiclassical regime , is certainly expected to hold for any coherent - state representation that might be employed ",
    "provided one correctly interprets what ` semiclassical regime ' means in each case .",
    "a few words regarding the purely computational aspects of the method are in place . in the numerical calculations reported in this paper",
    "we have adopted the simplest possible strategy of implementation , which consists in propagating simultaneously the coherent - state trajectories and their corresponding amplitudes .",
    "but since trajectories evolve independently , an alternative approach would be to propagate them separately , storing the coherent - state coordinates at pre - determined time intervals , and use this information afterwards in order to propagate the fully coupled amplitude equation  perhaps employing interpolation algorithms if coordinates are needed at intermediate instants .",
    "this preliminary propagation of classical orbits could , of course , take full advantage of parallelization , especially if single basis elements are propagated with ease .",
    "it is however in those cases in which the very propagation of individual trajectories is a computationally demanding task  either because the system has an extremely large number of degrees of freedom or because no analytical expression for the hamiltonian is available  that this ` two - stage ' procedure would most definitely be the strategy of choice .",
    "in addition , it would allow for more sophisticated sampling techniques , since it would then be possible to select trajectories based on knowledge of their entire story , and not relying just on their initial proximity to the quantum state .",
    "thus , for instance , one could identify orbits which , though unimportant at early stages of the propagation , give a significant contribution later on .",
    "as a final and interesting remark , we note that the multiconfigurational ehrenfest method , @xcite as specifically designed for ` on - the - fly ' non - adiabatic dynamics , can be obtained at once from the presented formalism as the particular case wherein each basis - set element is taken to be a composite coherent state consisting of a canonical part and an @xmath2 part with the particle - number parameter @xmath61 set to unity .",
