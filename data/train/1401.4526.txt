    "the tunnel barriers play an important role in solid state physics .",
    "they determine the energy spectrum of coupled quantum wells and quantum dots , stability of charged impurities and excitons in electric field , miniband transport and bloch oscillations in superlattices , etc . , and underlie a number of electronic devices such as tunnel and resonant tunnel diodes  @xcite .",
    "the tunnel barrier is an essential ingredient of a ferromagnet - semiconductor spin - injecting heterostructure which enables one to overcome the problem of the conductivity mismatch between the ferromagnet and semiconductor and achieve a high efficiency of spin injection  @xcite .",
    "about a decade ago , it was realized that the process of electron tunneling is spin dependent itself due spin - orbit interaction which couples spin states with the orbital motion .",
    "it was shown that the rashba spin - orbit coupling at interfaces as well as the dresselhaus coupling in the bulk of barrier make the barrier tunnel transmission dependent of the spin orientation and wave vector of incident electrons  @xcite .",
    "the effect of spin - dependent tunneling was proposed to be applied for the pure electric injection and detection of spin polarized carriers  @xcite . in the case of rashba and dresselhaus coupling in ( 001)-grown barriers in bulk semiconductors ,",
    "the spin polarization of transmitted electrons linearly scales with the lateral component @xmath0 of the electron wave vector and is of opposite sign for the wave vectors @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the proposed methods of spin injection require the application of an additional , lateral , electric field which causes the electron drift in the interface plane and makes the electron distribution in the @xmath0 space anisotropic .    in this paper , we show that the spin injection via tunnel structures in bulk semiconductors can be achieved even for isotropic in the interface plane electron distribution .",
    "such an effect occurs for barriers of sufficiently low spatial symmetry only being not allowed , e.g. , in ( 001)-grown structures .",
    "microscopically , it is caused by the combined action of the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling in the barrier and the rashba spin - orbit coupling at the barrier interfaces . to be specific ,",
    "we consider single - barrier tunnel structures with the ( 110 ) crystallographic orientation and present an analytical theory of the spin injection .",
    "consider a zinc - blende - type semiconductor heretostructure with the symmetric potential barrier grown along the @xmath2 $ ] axis , see fig .  1 .     the sketch of a symmetric tunnel barrier with the ( 110 ) crystallographic orientation .",

    "the terms @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 contain the derivative of the third , second , first , and zero order , respectively .",
    "we assume the kinetic energy of electrons to be substantially smaller than the barrier height @xmath36 and , therefore , neglect the terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 in comparison with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the total spin polarization proportional to the tunneling current though the barrier @xmath37 . in ( 110)-grown structures ,",
    "such an effect is allowed by symmetry and phenomenologically given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the steady - state spin density . indeed ,",
    "symmetric ( 110)-grown barriers are described by the @xmath40 point group which consists of the two - fold rotation axis @xmath3 , two mirror planes @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and the identity element  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . in this point group , the vector component @xmath37 and pseudovector component @xmath43",
    "belong to the same irreducible representation , i.e. , under all symmetry operations of the group they transform in a similar way  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the symmetry allows the linear coupling of @xmath43 and @xmath37 and imposes the condition that the current - induced spin density @xmath39 is an even function with respect to the barrier center .",
    "the latter suggests that the electrons transmitted through the barrier and those reflected from the barrier have the same spin polarization .",
    "note that , in ( 001)-grown structures , the spin injection is absent for the tunneling current along the barrier normal and may occur only in the presence of the lateral component of the current .",
    "equation   also shows the possibility of the inverse effect : a non - equilibrium spin polarization of carriers along the @xmath44 axis causes the direct current through the barrier .",
    "we assume that the electrons incident upon the barrier are unpolarized and their distribution in the interface plane is isotropic .",
    "symmetry analysis of the spin - orbit terms shows that the spin injection given by eq .   can be microscopically related to ( i )",

    "the mechanism of the spin injection can be viewed as a two - step process illustrated in fig .",

    "unpolarized electrons with different in - plane wave vectors @xmath7 are incident upon the barrier and tunnel through it being affected by the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling . the term @xmath33 can be considered as the spin - dependent correction to the effective mass along @xmath48 which is proportional to @xmath7 , compare eqs .   and  .",
    "due to the fact that the barrier transmission probability depends on the effective mass , the electrons at the exit from the barrier gain the spin polarization @xmath49 .",
    "similar mechanism of anisotropic spin filtering caused by the dresselhaus coupling for ( 001)-grown structures was considered in refs .",
    "note that , for the equal population of the @xmath7 and @xmath50 states , the net spin polarization of electrons is absent at this step .",
    "the net spin polarization emerges at the second stage due to the action of the rashba spin - orbit coupling at the interface , see eq .  .",
    "the rashba coupling can be considered as an effective magnetic field @xmath47 lying in the interface plane which causes the spin rotation .",
    "the @xmath51-component of the effective field @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath7 , therefore , the rotation axes are opposite for the electrons with positive and negative @xmath7 . as a result",
    ", the rotation leads to the spin component @xmath46 for all the electrons transmitted though the barrier .",
    "the value of the net spin polarization is determined by the efficiency of anisotropic spin filtering in the barrier bulk and the spin rotation angle at the interface .",
    "we note that similar mechanism leads to the spin polarization of electrons reflected from the barrier .",
    "the theory of spin injection can be conveniently developed by using the spin - dependent transfer matrix technique .",
