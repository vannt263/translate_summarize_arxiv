    "electron doping via co substitution of fe induces a shift of the fermi level towards the conduction band , that leads to metallic - like transport and curie - weiss behavior already at low co concentrations @xcite .",

    "<S> temperature dependent magnetization , muon spin rotation and @xmath0fe mssbauer spectroscopy experiments performed on crystals of intermetallic fega@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) are reported . </S>",
    "<S> whereas at @xmath5 even a sensitive magnetic microprobe such as @xmath6sr does not detect magnetism , all other samples display weak ferromagnetism with a magnetic moment of up to 0.22 @xmath7 per fe atom . as a function of doping and of temperature a crossover from short range to long range magnetic order is observed , characterized by a broadly distributed spontaneous internal field . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 remain in the short range ordered state down to the lowest investigated temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from short range to long range order appears to be accompanied by a change of the character of the spin fluctuations , which exhibit spin wave excitations signature in the lro part of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> mssbauer spectroscopy for @xmath10 and 0.32 indicates that the internal field lies in the plane perpendicular to the crystallographic @xmath11 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the field distribution and its evolution with doping suggest that the details of the fe magnetic moment formation and the consequent magnetic state are determined not only by the dopant concentration but also by the way the replacement of the ga atoms surrounding the fe is accomplished . </S>"
