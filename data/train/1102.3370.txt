    "over the past century , the investigation of the structure and evolution of the universe has become a major scientific thrust .",
    "einstein s equations made the geometry of the cosmos inseparable from its matter content .",
    "thus there are many intriguing investigations , geometric as well as physical , ranging from whether the spatial section of universe is open or closed , and what the global topology is , down to lensing by individual mass concentrations , and detecting the signatures of galactic black holes . equally important",
    "is the geometry on a range of intermediate scales , and its effect on the paths of the light rays that constitute the bulk of our cosmological observations .",
    "the assumption of a homogeneous friedmann -  - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe made the einstein equations tractable , and later , complemented by perturbation theory , opened the way to our present day understanding of an observable universe that is @xmath0 times larger than a human frame , and @xmath1 times older than a human lifespan .",
    "currently , in most cases the cosmological observations are anlysyed within the framework of homogenous models , for example supernova observations @xcite galaxy redshift surveys @xcite in particular baryon acoutiong oscilations @xcite , and cosmic microvawve backrogund radition @xcite .",
    "the cosmological principle remains a core ingredient of the standard concordance model , but as our measurements become ever more complete and detailed , deviations from homogeneity will have to be taken seriously .",
    "certainly , inhomogeneity exists on a wide range of scales , and a knowledge of the associated spacetime curvature is indispensable to the detailed analysis of observational data .    whether one views it as detecting what level of inhomogeneity exists , or verifying how well homogeneity is satisfied",
    ", the investigation is essential .",
    "the most important reason is that the scientific method requires it  if you _ can _ test an assumption you _ should _  not just in one way , but in many different ways .",
    "the history of science can provide many examples of why different tests are important .",
    "the most well known example is probably the ptolemaic vs copernican model of the universe . at the time of nicolaus copernicus , the ptolemaic model with",
    "its large number of epicycles was able to fit cosmological / astronomical data much better than the copernican model .",
    "thus , we should bear in mind that consistency with current observations is not a final _ proof _ of the underlying assumptions of the model , and as more data become available we should test our assumptions using different methods .",
    "one way of testing the assumption of homogeneity is to look at the consistency relations between the observables .",
    "a consistency check is based on verifying whether the relation between observations is as given by the homogeneous cosmological model . previously , ribeiro and stoeger considered the consistency between the expected number counts in a homogeneous model , a commonly used galaxy luminosity function , and the observed galaxy number counts @xcite .",
    "later they showed that such an analysis strongly depends on the distance definition used @xcite . in @xcite clarkson ,",
    "bassett & lu showed that in friedmann models that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not independent but must obey a special relation .",
    "thus , by checking if observations obey this relation , one can test the assumption of homogeneity .",
    "a limited version of such a test was proposed in @xcite , where just @xmath2 alone can be used to test the consistency between observations and a spatially flat homogeneous model .",
    "another interesting aspect is to check the consistency between the age of the universe inferred from the cosmological models with ` local ' ( age of meteorites or stars in our own galaxy ) measurements .    in this paper",
    "we take another approach .",
    "we study the observations within an inhomogeneous framework .",
    "the motivation is as follows : if the the universe is indeed homogeneous , then the data should favour a homogeneous model over inhomogeneous ones .    as argued in @xcite ,",
    "spherically symmetric models are the logical first step away from homogeneity .",
    "radial inhomogeneity is intrinsically hard to detect and separate from other past null cone effects .",
    "our observations reveal a tilted slice through spacetime , and what we see is affected by the details of the cosmic evolution due to the bulk equations of state , the evolution of light sources , and the lumpiness of the matter distribution .",
    "the simplest spherically symmetric , non - stationary , non - homogeneous solution of the einstein equations is the lematre - tolman  ( lt ) model .",
    "currently there is a large number of papers that use the lt model to fit cosmological data without dark energy  a non - compete list includes @xcite ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "however , these methods are based on what is often called the _",
    "direct approach _ , which can be summarized as follows : ` assume a model , fit the model to the data , obtain the best fit parameters of the model and compare the goodness of fit with the standard cosmological model ' .",
    "the caveat of this kind of approach is that any assumed parametrization is not general , and may omit a large part of the set of all possible models , hence a better approach is the so called _ inverse approach_. within the inverse approach one uses the data to construct the model . in theory , this approach is much less restricted by choice of model and parameterization than the direct approach . in practice",
    "however one still needs to impose _ some _ additional assumptions to make the calculations tractable .",
    "the problem is that we need to be able to solve the einstein equations .",
    "thus , one either employs a series expansion around the observer @xcite , or assumes spherical symmetry to calculate the evolution of the universe within the whole observable domain . here",
    "one can either use ` observer coordinates ' and the fluid - ray tetrad approach @xcite , or use standard coordinates in the spherically symmetric dust model , i.e. the lt model , and determine the null - cone data relations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will use the inverse method with the lematre - tolman  model to test the assumption of homogeneity .",
    "the motivation and plan is as follows : ` start with an inhomogeneous model more general than flrw , apply the inverse method to the actual observational data to specify the model , then if the model obtained in this way is homogeneous ( or very close to homogeneous ) we find in favour of homogeneity , if on the other hand the model is significantly inhomogeneous , we disfavor the homogeneity '",
    ". it should be emphasised that we can only _ favour _ or _ disfavor _",
    ", not actually _ prove _ or _",
    "rule out_. as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite a lematre - tolman  model could be found to fit any reasonable observational data for the luminosity ( or diameter ) distance versus redshift , and the galaxy number - counts versus redshift ; while the difficulty of separating cosmic evolution , source evolution , and inhomogeneity was pointed out .",
    "this concept was expanded , with an important correction , and explicit numerical implementations were developed in @xcite . a possible method for testing source evolution theories in the presence of inhomogeneity",
    "was suggested in @xcite .",
    "it is important to begin making the connection with real data , as we do here .",
    "we note however , that the quantity and quality of current data is not sufficient to draw any clear conclusions from the lt models obtained .",
    "the purpose is to explore the various options and uncover potential difficulties , so that a proper analysis of future data will be possible .",
    "it is also important to investigate the question of homogeneity using many different methods and datasets .",
    "consequently , this paper applies the metric of the cosmos approach to a different set of observations .",
    "it uses the luminosity distances of supernovae and the maximum ages of galaxies , both as functions of redshift .",
    "this is in contrast to using the redshift variations of luminosity or diameter distances and source number counts , as considered previously @xcite .",
    "the lt ( lematre - tolman ) model @xcite is a spherically symmetric solution of einstein s equations where the gravitational source is dust . in comoving and synchronous",
    "coordinates , the metric is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an arbitrary function , @xmath6 .",
    "the spatial sections are flat only if @xmath7 , so @xmath8 is a geometric factor .",
    "the areal radius @xmath9 obeys @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the cosmological constant . from ( [ vel ] ) , @xmath13 is the total energy per unit mass of the dust particles .",
    "equation ( [ vel ] ) is a first integral of the einstein equations , and @xmath14 is another arbitrary function of integration that gives the gravitational mass within each comoving shell of coordinate radius @xmath15 . the mass density in energy units is : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "equation ( [ vel ] ) can be solved by simple integration giving a relation for the age of the universe , @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 appears as an integration function , and is an arbitrary function of @xmath15 giving the time at which @xmath21 on each worldline .",
    "this means that the big bang is not simultaneous as in the flrw models , but occurs at different times at different distances from the origin .",
    "since all the formulae given so far are covariant under coordinate transformations of the form @xmath22 , one of the functions @xmath23 , @xmath14 and @xmath20 can be fixed at will by the choice of @xmath24 .",
    "either does or does not have a vacuum region , it either does or does not have a spatial maximum ; any @xmath25 either does or does not change sign ; any @xmath20 either does or does not have a constant region.]therefore , once this choice is made , a given l ",
    "t model is fully determined by two of these arbitrary functions . in other words ,",
    "we need two observed relationships to pin down an lt model . for more information on the lt model ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "since light propagates on null geodesics , let us define _ the _ past null cone ( pnc ) by the observation event @xmath26 for a central observer at the present day .",
    "the equation for incoming radial null geodesics is @xmath27 let us choose the radial coordinate so that , on the pnc , @xmath28 where by a hat or a subscript wedge ( e.g. @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) we denote any quantity evaluated on the pnc .",
    "( note : this choice of @xmath15 is possible only on a single light cone . in the following",
    ", we always refer to the pnc of @xmath31 . )",
    "this gauge choice simplifies the pnc equation : @xmath32 the equation for the redshift reads @xcite @xmath33    we aim to show how to define an lt model from luminosity and age data , so we need to express the null cone relations using observables like luminosity ( or diameter ) distance and the age of the universe . in the lt model with observer at the origin , the angular diameter distance equals the areal radius @xmath34 at the point of emission . using the reciprocity theorem @xcite",

    "it is convenient to let @xmath62 so that @xmath63 .",
    "while the above are the basis for a numerical algorithm over most of the @xmath40 range , two loci require special attention , the origin , and the maximum in @xmath34(z ) @xcite .      at the origin , @xmath64 @xmath65 , and similarly @xmath66 etc .",

    "( in fact ( [ ahm ] ) applies also in the case of non - zero pressure @xcite . )",
    "if one can measure @xmath102 , then , for given @xmath12 , ( [ ahm ] ) immediately gives the total gravitational mass within this radius .",
    "this holds regardless of the magnitude of any intervening radial inhomogeneity , and it holds only at @xmath102 . as we will see , this @xmath133 must agree with the @xmath133 ( and @xmath8 ) obtained from numerical integration .",
    "the algorithm outlined above requires us to provide @xmath18 , @xmath34 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , etc at any given @xmath40 .",
    "real observations merely give us a set of discrete values .",
    "hence there is a problem of how to calculate higher derivatives based on discrete values . in the case of ideal measurements one could use numerical algorithms to estimate the derivatives , for example the three - point or five - point derivation rules @xcite . in practice however , the data are too noisy ( supernova data at @xmath136 ) or there are too few measurements ( age data , and supernova data for @xmath137 )",
    ".    one method for extracting a smooth curve from the data would be to apply a procedure like the moving average .",
    "such a procedure was outlined in ref .",
    "another would be to apply some kind of a smoothing , like gaussian smoothing  for details see @xcite .",
    "the question is how to smooth the data without distorting it , or in other words how to distinguish between noise and real variability of the data . in the literature",
    "this problem is mostly investigated in the context of a reconstruction the evolution of dark energy where the data also needs to be differentiated twice to constrain the dark energy equation of state @xcite .    to highlight the problem ,",
    "let us for a moment focus on one procedure of smoothing the data .",
    "let us consider the supernova data , @xmath53 , in a given redshift bin , and apply the least squares method to fit a polynomial to the points in the bin .",
    "now , the bin is moving , i.e. for each supernova we consider @xmath138 supernovae around it and we fit a polynomial to these @xmath139 points .",
    "then we move to the next supernova and repeat the procedure .",
    "on the one hand , the smaller @xmath139 is , the smaller the redshift interval , and therefore the more the flexibility of a fit  one can extract more detailed information about the curve . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath139 is too small then the fitting procedure picks up the ` noise ' of the data .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "if the number of supernovae within an interval is @xmath140 , then the noise becomes significant .",
    "even with @xmath141 we can still see some artifacts like the minimum around @xmath142 , which is rather unphysical .",
    "this shows that we still need a much larger large number of observations to generate a reliable average @xmath53 curve . at this point however , when we only have a few hundreds of supernova measurements , and a mere 30-odd age estimations .",
    "the present data is simply not good enough to be used in the algorithm outlined above .",
    "the situation will obviously improve over the coming years .",
    "still , we would like to use the real data to see what kind of results can be obtained when applying our algorithm .",
    "we therefore decided to apply a crude approach and to fit a chosen curve to the whole data .",
    "of course , this is something that one would prefer to avoid .",
    "the idea of the inverse problem is to use pure data , without any assumptions of its form and use it to specify the geometry of the spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , let us proceed in this way , bearing in mind that once the data is of better quality and large quantity , it will be possible to apply the method in its true spirit .",
    "inevitably , the choice of a fitting function must affect the form of the output . in order to minimise this bias",
    "we consider several different functions , so that we can assess the impact of such choices on the results of our analyses .     denotes the bin size : within each redshift interval that contains @xmath139 supernovae , a 3rd order polynomial is fitted to the data .",

    "both cases allow for decreasing , increasing or a constant @xmath100 function up to at least @xmath223 gpc .",
    "the distance of 3.5 gpc corresponds to @xmath224 , and at this distance the fit to the data is no longer reliable ; as shown in fig .",
    "[ figdata ] , for @xmath225 there is only small number of data .",

    "we have pursued the broad question of what observations can tell us about the geometry of our universe , and to what extent the observations support homogeneity . as the cosmological datasets become larger , more accurate , and reach deeper @xmath40 , we should be able to relax our assumptions and derive our spacetime metric in increasing detail , verifying to what extent , and on what scale , it is homogeneous on average . while some assumptions will always be required , it is important to test different sets of assumptions , and to test theories in different ways .",
    "here we have shown how measurements of maximum galactic ages , together with snia luminosities , over the available range of redshifts , can be used to determine the free metric functions of a spherically symmetric cosmology  the lematre - tolman  metric .",
    "previous work used galaxy number counts instead of maximum ages . reasons why a spherically symmetric model is a good place to start such an investigation , and appropriate to currently available datasets , are discussed above and elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the algorithm does a numerical integration of the des we derived , but requires careful treatment of the origin , @xmath78 , and the neighbourhood of the maximum in the diameter distance , @xmath227  the apparent horizon , to avoid numerical difficulties .",
    "we have adapted the apparent horizon correction method used for a different dataset combination @xcite to our case , and shown how the properties of this apparent horizon provide relationships between observables and integrated quantities that allow one to detect a cumulative systematic error in the data and make a correction , thus ensuring a self - consistent solution .",
    "all attempts to integrate past null cone data face potential divergences at the apparent horizon .",
    "we have discussed the problem of extracting smooth functions from discrete data , and estimating the uncertainties in the output .",
    "we adopted a method , based on a range of possible fitting functions , that is appropriate to the limited and noisy data currently available .",
    "also , in contrast to the inverse methods usually considered , we did not limit ourselves to the zero-@xmath12 lt models .",
    "usually , when considering inhomogeneous models , people are seeking to explain the data without the cosmological constant .",
    "recently however , inhomogeneous models with the cosmological constant have started to be considered more seriously ; see for example @xcite or @xcite . in order to fully test the assumption of homogeneity we can not set @xmath220 ,",
    "thus we consider two cases @xmath228 and @xmath200 .",
    "we have executed our algorithm using currently available data , and presented the results .",
    "though the data is not yet good enough to attach any confidence to our output , we have analysed our graphs as an interesting exercise .",
    "in fact our results are quite reasonable , and in particular we have shown that there is no conflict between the data used and an lt model without @xmath12 .",
    "we expect much stronger constraints to emerge as the data improves .",
    "it should be emphasised that the stated confidence levels in the concordance model are much higher exactly because the homogeneity assumption removes huge amounts of potential uncertainty .",
    "homogeneity is not being tested in those confidence calculations .",
    "we note that comparisons of north and south values in e.g. the sloan data , or angular variations in the hubble flow , have yielded differences of uncertain significance .",
    "thus we have demonstrated that the metric extraction method is both theoretically and numerically viable , and should be developed and extended , as an important and strong check on homogeneity .",
    "it is because both time and distance vary down our past null cone in the radial direction , so observations are affected by source evolution as well as cosmic expansion , that testing radial homogeneity on top of that  without assuming it somewhere  is very difficult .",
    "the relationship between the the paths of light rays  the past null cone  and the geometry ( metric ) they pass through is intrinsically non - linear",
    ". therefore our analysis of observations must take this into account .",
    "the generalisation of the metric extraction method to handling angular variation is intrinsically complex , but must be pursued .",
    "in @xcite the authors took an lt model that reproduces the luminosity and density curves of the currently preferred @xmath12cdm  model .",
    "they estimated the age of the universe at the central location ( at us ) for this lt model , and with their method they found the age of their chosen lt model near us is @xmath229  gy at a @xmath230 confidence level , but still within @xmath230 of the locally measured age limits .",
    "we point out that they did not find the best fit of an lt model to the observations .",
    "they assumed the luminosity and density curves of the best fit flrw model are the best fit for any model .",
    "however , once one allows inhomogeneity , as one should if lt is being used , there is much more leeway in the luminosity and density data curves than is apparent from the best - fit flrw parameters and the quoted confidence levels .",
    "in contrast , our work uses the data to directly construct the model , and finds the age measurements are consistent with a range of reasonable inhomogeneous models ( including some close to homogeneous ) .",
