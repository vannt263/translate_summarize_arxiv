    "was shown to be @xmath25  kpc , with a very weak proportionality with galaxy @xmath26 luminosity @xcite . however , there is some evidence that by @xmath27 , the absorbing gas cross sections of galaxies may be less than @xmath28  kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that strong absorption serves as an efficient selection method for finding damped absorbers ( dlas ; defined as having @xmath29 [ atoms  ] ) .",
    "they found that the equivalent widths of both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are very often greater than @xmath32   when the system is a dla ( also see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "measuring the cosmic evolution in the number densities of dlas is useful for measuring evolution in the cosmological mass density of neutral gas , @xmath33 .",
    "selecting dlas using absorption renders the computation of @xmath21 directly proportional to the measured redshift number density for systems . using this approach , rao & turnshek",
    "have shown that there is no compelling evidence that dlas evolve from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , though currently published 21cm emission surveys require strong evolution to @xmath27 .",
    "this would suggest a strong evolution in @xmath21 at the lowest redshifts .    a measurement of the redshift number density , @xmath36 , for systems at @xmath37 could be useful to either corroborate or to challenge these findings and to place constraints on scenarios of global galaxy evolution .",
    "if absorbers evolve away over the interval @xmath38 , observed as a down  turning break in the @xmath36 distribution , it would imply that either the number or typical size of the absorbers is decreasing .",
    "if there is a paucity of large equivalent width systems having strong absorption , this would indirectly indicate strong evolution in dlas .",
    "measuring @xmath36 at @xmath37 requires ultraviolet ( uv ) spectroscopy ( because the doublet is not redshifted to wavelengths redward of the atmospheric cut off ) .",
    "there exists a large database of uv spectra obtained with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst)_. because of the g270h grating wavelength coverage , especially the upper wavelength cut off ,",
    "these data are tailored for comparing the @xmath36 of absorbers from @xmath27 to @xmath39 to that published by steidel & sargent ( 1992 , hereafter ss92 ) for @xmath40 .",

    "a total of 207 fos/_hst _ quasar / agn g270h spectra have been archived .",
    "the g270h spectra cover the wavelength region @xmath48 to @xmath49   and provide a redshift coverage for mg0.1emii  @xmath0 absorption from @xmath19 ( galactic ) to @xmath39 .",
    "these spectra have a resolution of @xmath50 with four diodes per resolution element .    many of the fos spectra were observed and published by the _ hst _",
    "quasar absorption line key project ( kp , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and have kindly been made available for this work .",
    "the remaining archived spectra were generously provided by dr .",
    "s. kirhakos in fully reduced form and with continuum normalization .",
    "these reductions were performed using kp software @xcite in the same fashion that dr .",
    "kirhakos reduced the kp sample ; thus , there has been uniform treatment of the reductions of all spectra for the survey .",
    "quasars and/or agn with emission redshifts larger than 1.7 were removed from the database .",
    "this constraint was applied to ensure that the quasar emission line was _ not _ redward of the wavelength region covered by the g270h spectra .",
    "this was to avoid confusion with the forest and/or lyman series lines of relatively strong , higher redshift metal  line absorbers .    for each quasar / agn in the resulting sample ,",
    "the search for absorption was limited to wavelength regions 1000   redward of galactic absorption in order to avoid possible confusion with high velocity cloud and/or galactic absorption .",
    "the search was also limited to redward of the emission line peak .",
    "again , this was to avoid confusion with forest and/or lyman series lines .",
    "since this survey is for _ intervening _ absorption , the search was also limited to @xmath51   blueward of the quasar / agn emission line .",
    "application of this constraint hopefully avoided the possible inclusion of any absorption that may be intrinsic to the quasars themselves .",
    "of the original 207 spectra , 60 were eliminated due to the above selection criteria .",
    "of the 147 spectra remaining , 104 had full g270h wavelength coverage ( 1000   redward of galactic ) available for the survey .",
    "the partial wavelength regions surveyed in the remaining 43 spectra ranged from a small @xmath52   to just short of @xmath53   , with a typical coverage of @xmath54@xmath55   .    the equivalent width detection threshold in each pixel was computed , and the identification of absorption features and doublet candidates was performed using the software of @xcite .",
    "candidate doublets were then examined visually for inclusion into the list of absorbers .",
    "the equivalent widths were measured using the interactive fitting software of @xcite , which allows multiple gaussian fits to resolved lines . the rest ",
    "frame equivalent widths are presented in table  1 .",
    "the kp spectra represent an unbiased sample of quasar / agn lines of sight , in that the sample was objectively compiled without consideration of _ a priori _ knowledge of absorption systems .",
    "however , the archive spectra do _ not _ constitute an unbiased sample .",
    "quasars / agn observed for the purpose of finding metal  line absorption near low redshift galaxies would introduce a bias into this survey .",
    "inclusion of systems from biased lines of sight would yield a measured @xmath36 larger than the true value .",
    "conversely , including biased lines of sight along which no systems are found would result in a larger total redshift path for the survey , and thus yield a measured @xmath36 smaller than the true value .    in the final sample of quasars / agn ,",
    "74 were observed for the key project and are thus unbiased lines of sight ( apart from concerns for gravitational lensing ) .",
    "the remaining 73 spectra are a heterogenous sample from the point of view of why the quasars / agn were observed .",
    "a study of the on  line proposal abstracts for these quasars revealed that , for all but five , the scientific motivations for the observations were either to study the forest lines or the environment surrounding or intrinsic to the quasar / agn themselves .",
    "the five biased lines of sight were excluded from the survey statistics and all subsequent analysis .",
    "however , they were included in the survey for systems in order to `` test '' the search algorithm .",
    "the previously published systems that lie in the redshift range searched in this survey were found and are discussed below .",
    "the automated doublet finding software yielded a total of 16 _ candidate _ doublets .",
    "eight were clearly blends of known metal lines from other , known intervening systems .",
    "one of the remaining eight candidates ( @xmath56 in pg @xmath57 ) was an artifact of flat fielding residuals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; its redshifted @xmath30 and @xmath58 transitions were misaligned by @xmath59 . a second , large equivalent width candidate ( @xmath60 in b2 @xmath61 ) was dropped from the sample because it was a spurious feature ; the absorption had no doublet structure and there were no corroborating transitions ( which are common for very strong systems ) .",
    "the remaining six candidates were found to be bonafied systems , particularly when @xmath31 and/or @xmath62 absorption corroborated the absorption .",

    "based upon an efficient selection method for finding and counting damped absorbers ( dlas ) , with @xmath153 [ atoms ] , @xcite showed that there is little to no indication that the redshift number density of dlas evolves from @xmath18 to @xmath20 .",
    "however , at @xmath27 , the inferred redshift number density of galaxies with @xmath29 [ atoms  ] , based upon 21cm emission surveys , is apparently a factor of five to six lower @xcite .",

    "some recent 21cm results are suggestive that the integral number of lsb and low luminosity selected galaxies may bring the observations into better agreement @xcite .",
    "the roughly constant redshift density of dlas from @xmath166 strengthens arguments based upon @xmath167 data that dlas are not tracing galaxies undergoing the bulk of cosmic star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "even if the integral number of low luminosity , rich dwarf and large cross  section lsb galaxies reconciled the absorption  selected dla and selected dla redshift number densities at @xmath19 , it would not necessarily translate to a similar reconciliation for @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "this is because the rich dwarf and lsb galaxies have relatively low masses @xcite , so even if their large cross sections reconcile the @xmath36 numbers , their combined mass / numbers are likely not large enough for their integrated mass to raise the value of @xmath179 at @xmath27 .    as such",
    ", it seems unlikely that the factor of five to six discrepancy between the absorption line data and the 21cm emission @xmath151 cosmological mass density can be reconciled by integrating to smaller and smaller decades of mass .",
    "these conclusions are based upon the assumption that there is ( 1 ) no bias for a large mean column density from the @xcite column density distribution , and ( 2 ) no evolution in the column density distribution from @xmath180 .",
