    "by virtue of their high , sustained luminosity across the spectrum , quasars are ideal targets for studies of the evolution of structure throughout the history of the cosmos .",
    "whilst a rare phenomenon in our local volume of space , the comoving density of luminous agn rises sharply as one goes back in time , to a peak ( schmidt , schneider & gunn . , 1995 ; fan et al . 2001 ) or a plateau ( miyaji , hasinger & schmidt , 2000 ) around @xmath9=2 , an epoch dependence echoing the star formation history of galaxies ( e.g. madau et al . 1996 ; steidel et al .",
    "it is widely believed that most massive galaxies undergo a short - lived agn phase , as they build up the supermassive black holes observed in local galactic cores ( magorrian et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "thus in observing a quasar , one catches its host galaxy at a significant period in its evolution .    at far - infrared ( fir ) to millimetre ( mm ) wavelengths , agn have long been recognised as amongst the most prominent high - redshift sources ( e.g. the compilations in mcmahon et al . , 1999 ( m99 ) ; rowan - robinson , 2000 ) . while there is strong evidence that emission from this region of the spectrum is thermal reradiation from warm dust ( e.g. hughes et al . , 1993 ) , it is not always clear that the agn itself is the sole contributor to dust heating , and it is plausible that a fraction of the submm luminosity could derive from stars in the surrounding galaxy .",
    "there would thus be a direct overlap between dusty quasars and scuba survey sources , which , it is argued , are the star - forming progenitors of massive spheroids .",
    "hence , targetted submm and mm surveys of high - redshift agn are valuable in elucidating the nature of cosmological submm sources , and the relation between the evolution of the host galaxy and its central black hole .",
    "m99 observed a small sample of @xmath3 , radio - quiet quasars with the jcmt s scuba submm camera to high sensitivity ( @xmath10mjy ) , to determine the submm properties of the `` typical '' high - redshift agn . a complementary , broad - but - shallow ( @xmath11mjy ) strategy",
    "was adopted by isaak et al .",
    "( 2002 : i02) the scuba bright quasar survey ( sbqs ) ( paper i) with the principal aim of defining a statistically - significant sample of submm sources bright enough to permit a range of follow - up study .",
    "roughly a quarter of the targets were brighter than the @xmath12mjy limit , suggesting that a substantial fraction of high - redshift quasars have far - infrared luminosities comparable to their blue luminosities . a natural question is whether this ubiquitous submm activity discovered at @xmath3 is typical of high - redshift agn in general : is the optically - luminous quasar phase always accompanied by a dust - rich submillimetre source , or does this only occur at the highest redshifts ? in the current paper we present the results of a comparative survey designed to address this question , targetting the `` agn epoch '' at @xmath0 , the era at which the space density of quasars reaches its maximum , and by which most ( @xmath13 percent ) of the matter that will ever be accreted onto supermassive black holes has already served as fuel for agn .",
    "a presentation of these results , along with brief analysis , is the purpose of the current paper : a more detailed and wide - ranging study , in the context of all the recent mm and submm quasar surveys in this series ( m99 ; i02 ; omont et al . , 2001 ;",
    "omont et al . , 2002 ) , will be given in a forthcoming work ( priddey et al .",

    "our aim was to find a sample of bright , medium - redshift quasars well - matched to the @xmath3 sample observed by isaak et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( figure 1 ) . to avoid too heterogeneous a sample , we restricted the input catalogues to a few large , homogeneous surveys .",
    "the final target list comprises quasars preselected from the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs : hewett , foltz & chaffee , 1995 ) and the hamburg quasar survey ( hs : engels et al .",
    "1998 ; hagen et al .",
    "the first selection criterion is based on optical luminosity represented by absolute @xmath19-band magnitude ( @xmath20 ) . at @xmath21 , the @xmath22",
    "photometric band samples very close to rest - frame @xmath19 , and @xmath23 starts to do so towards higher redshifts . using a combination of these bands",
    "therefore gives an absorption - free assessment of the rest - frame optical magnitude , minimizing the error due extrapolation of the continuum .",
    "this overcomes many of the problems encountered when deriving @xmath20 for @xmath3 quasars e.g. contamination of the @xmath24 band by strong emission and absorption features ( as detailed in paper i ) .",
    "similarly , at @xmath25 , observed - frame @xmath19 becomes compromised by the strong civ and ly-@xmath26 emission lines .    hence , to obtain a sample of luminous @xmath25 quasars all with @xmath22 and @xmath23 magnitudes , we cross - correlated catalogues of bright , medium - redshift quasars with the 2mass near - infrared catalogue through the web - based interface at ipac ( http://www.ipac.caltech.edu ) .",
    "counting sources out to a radius of 60 arcsec enabled us to determine a maximum association radius of 5 arcsec , within which the probability of a chance association is @xmath270.5 percent .",
    "absolute @xmath19-band magnitudes were calculated from apparent @xmath22 and @xmath23 magnitudes thereby obtained ( all our targets were detected in both bands ) weighted according to the proximity of the band to @xmath19 in the redshifted spectrum .",
    "they have been corrected for galactic extinction , though in most cases this is negligible ( @xmath28mag ) .",

    "photometric errors in @xmath22 and @xmath23 are typically 0.10.2mag .    in order to match optical luminosity with the @xmath3 sample , objects with @xmath31 were initially selected i.e. adopting the same cosmology as per the selection of the @xmath3 sample cosmology introduces an average shift of @xmath320.2mag .",

    "a wide redshift range @xmath33 was chosen to maximize the potential number of targets ( figure 1 ) .",
    "to derive an observing sequence , the final selection was prioritized according to optical luminosity , the most luminous given preference .",
    "the nominal completeness limit for 2mass is 15.8 and 15.1 in @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "however , at the high galactic latitudes inhabited by these quasars , accurate detections up to one magnitude better than this can be achieved ( cutri et al . , 2000 ) . from this and our extensive quasar",
    "catalogue cross - correlations with 2mass , we estimate that at @xmath34 , the 2mass limit corresponds to @xmath35 , thus for the greater extent of our redshift range we are not in danger of overlooking bright potential targets that failed to be detected by 2mass .    the target list was correlated with the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) to identify radio - loud sources , which were excised from the list . as discussed in m99 and i02 , `` radio loud '' in this context",
    "primarily refers to the extent of contamination of the thermal submm continuum by the extrapolated radio synchrotron . assuming a spectral index @xmath36 , a source with @xmath37mjy ( below the nvss limit ) will have @xmath38mjy .",
    "the jcmt observing strategy for this project was the same as for the comparable @xmath3 program described in detail in i02 .",
    "to reiterate : the required rms ( 1@xmath39mjy ) can be reached in a short amount of observing in relatively poor ( zenith transmission 65% ) weather , so the jcmt fallback queue was utilized .",
    "scuba was employed in photometry mode , that is , the source is placed on the central bolometer , while the rest of the array samples the sky .",

    "the median rms flux is @xmath49mjy , with a narrow ( 0.4mjy ) interquartile range .",

    "the @xmath51 quasar lbqs b0018@xmath320220 , is significantly brighter than the nominal 10mjy limit : with @xmath52mjy , this is an exceptionally bright source , comparable to some of the brightest high - redshift submm sources known . to recover most of the other detections",
    ", one must go down to @xmath53mjy .",
    "in contrast , seven of the eight detections from the @xmath3 scuba bright survey ( i02 ) lie above 10mjy . in figure [ fig : s850_z ] , 850@xmath5 m fluxes of the @xmath0 sources reported in this paper are plotted along with the @xmath3 sample described in i02 .",
    "the curves represent the flux one would observe from an object of fixed luminosity as a function of redshift , assuming it has the mean far - infrared sed determined from @xmath3 quasars by priddey & mcmahon ( 2001 : pm01 ) , characterized by an isothermal temperature and emissivity index @xmath54k and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the large @xmath8-correction towards high redshift is one possible reason why the @xmath3 sources appear systematically brighter , however it is not obvious that the same sed is valid for all objects at all redshifts .",

    "nb : we do not correct the optical for intrinsic absorption . )",
    "any correlation between submm and optical is even less evident than in the case of the @xmath3 sources of i02 .",
    "this can be demonstrated formally using statistical tests .",

    "smirnov ( k  s ) test informs us that the null hypothesis that the distributions are the same note that , unlike the @xmath3 objects , this material is less prone to systematic error in the determination of @xmath20 : the magnitudes were calculated homogeneously , and the need for continuum extrapolation was minimized . yet ,",
    "the scatter remains , which suggests that it derives from an underlying variance in the submm  optical relation .    as discussed in i02",
    ", one might naively expect a submm  optical correlation , whether the dust - heating source is stars ( because spheroid mass scales with black hole mass ) or the agn ( because both @xmath56 and @xmath57 scale with bolometric luminosity ) .",
    "there is much scope for complexity which would smear out any correlation , for example the relative timing between agn fuelling and starburst , or , in an agn - powered scenario , the effects of varying the dust - torus geometry . as a _ caveat _ ,",
    "note that the nominal detection threshold , 10mjy , corresponds , at @xmath21 , to @xmath58 for the value of the magnitude cut , @xmath59 .",
    "we are therefore probably sampling only the bright tail of the fir luminosity distribution , and we are biased towards sources lying just above this @xmath60 threshold .",
    "thus for the detected sources , any such relation should be derived with caution .",
    "as described in section 2 , 2mass @xmath22 and @xmath23 magnitudes were obtained primarily to provide a homogeneous optical luminosity scale , directly sampling rest - frame @xmath19 .",
    "however , we can use them to assess , roughly , whether there is any correlation between submm detectability and optical colour for example , whether submm excess is connected with intrinsic reddening .",
    "the mean @xmath61 colour of the sample is 1.9@xmath70.5 , whereas that of the detections is 2.0@xmath70.5 ; similarly , @xmath62 of the sample is 1.3@xmath70.4 , of the detections 1.4@xmath70.5 .",
    "there is no evidence , then , that the detected quasars are redder than the underlying sample .",
    "however , given the large uncertainties , further work is required to address the question systematically .",
    "note that while we are requiring our sample to be bright in rest - frame @xmath19 , the selection procedure for these surveys ( e.g. lbqs @xmath63 ) also requires these objects to be bright in the rest - frame uv .",
    "this limit in observed @xmath19 translates into a limit on redness for a given luminosity at a given redshift . in the very worst case ( @xmath34 , @xmath59 ) ,",
    "objects redder than @xmath64 are excluded .",
    "on the other hand , by selecting objects bright in 2mass , we are biased against very blue quasars .",
    "there is , however , no statistically significant correlation between colour and either @xmath20 or @xmath9 ; and the distribution of spectral indices for the sample is similar to ( if a little narrower than ) that of the whole lbqs ( median @xmath65 , francis et al . 1991 ) .",
    "omont et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that those quasars exhibiting broad absorption lines ( bals ) in their optical spectra are preferentially detected in the submm .",
    "this is based on the marginal evidence that two out of their six @xmath3 iram detections were bals , relative to the background bal abundance of @xmath66% ( weymann et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "we are now in a better position to test this hypothesis .",
    "considering sources from the current paper , one of the detections ( hs b1141 + 4201 ) is unambiguously a bal , another ( hs b1310 + 4308 ) is possibly a weak bal . in comparison ,",
    "four of the non - detections are bals , with a number of others showing signs of weak absorption , a fraction consistent with the expected 10% .",
    "thus , although far from providing proof , these data do not rule out the omont et al . hypothesis . in a forthcoming paper ( priddey et al . , in prep . ) , we shall discuss , in detail , the evidence from a statistically - significant combination of all recent submm and mm quasar surveys .      figure [ fig : z2zcumhist ] is a cumulative histogram of redshift for the @xmath0 sample and for the detected subsample .",
    "the distributions appear different to the eye , with most of the detections lying at higher redshift .",
    "the median redshift of the sample is @xmath67 and that of the detections @xmath51 .",
    "the maximum difference between the distributions of detected and parent samples is 0.42 , corresponding to a k ",
    "s level of significance 5 percent , whilst for the the detected and undetected samples , the maximum is 0.51 , giving a level of significance @xmath681 percent . within this limited redshift range ,",
    "therefore , there is a suggestion that the submm detection rate increases with redshift over the range @xmath2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : lfirz ] , the far - infrared luminosity as a function of redshift has been derived by calculating the @xmath69-weighted mean of _ all _ the sbqs data i02 for @xmath70 , and the current work for @xmath71 and for detections and non - detections alike .",
    "850@xmath5 m flux has been converted to a luminosity assuming the isothermal sed derived in pm01 . changing this assumption would shift the @xmath3 and @xmath0 points relative to one another ( _ lowering _ the temperature or @xmath72 _ increases _ the relative luminosity of the @xmath3 points ) . in i02 , the fluxes of the non - detections were stacked to give an estimate of the submm flux of an average @xmath3 quasar after checking that sky - subtraction had been performed effectively , by observing that the distribution of the signal in all off - source pixels is a gaussian with zero mean .",
    "we repeat the experiment with the current @xmath0 data , and obtain @xmath73mjy , which agrees within the uncertainties with the @xmath3 value , @xmath74mjy .",
    "we can compare these results with those drawn from the scuba survey of high - redshift radio galaxies ( archibald et al . , 2001 )",
    ", from which a dramatic increase of fir luminosity with redshift was inferred , @xmath75 , over the whole redshift range @xmath76 ( see figure [ fig : lfirz ] ) .",
    "while our tentative low - redshift decline echoes this behaviour , the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath21 is far less marked .",
    "it is necessary to improve the statistics and to consider the selection effects before drawing firm conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , the disparity between the two populations is a potentially revealing commentary on the nature of radio loudness in agn .",
    "conceivably , radio galaxies follow a more dramatic evolution than the majority of agn of which they are perhaps the most extreme members their radio - loudness originating from a difference in formation mechanism .",
    "note however that the masses of their central black holes may be no more extreme than those of the most optically - luminous radio-_quiet _ quasars in the present sample , some of which would have @xmath77 , even assuming accretion at the maximum ( eddington ) rate .",
    "the present results show that , on average , the submm properties of luminous , radio - quiet quasars at @xmath0 are comparable , within the uncertainties , to those at @xmath3 , despite the lack of brighter sources in the present sample .",
    "although the uncertainties are too great to draw detailed conclusions , one can speculate on the physical processes underlying the redshift variation of submm detectability at fixed optical luminosity . in a starburst scenario , for example , the gas accretion efficiency and the star formation efficiency could each depend in a different way upon redshift ( through the dynamical time : kauffmann & haehnelt , 2000 ) .",
    "at @xmath3 , the host galaxy is presumably gas- ( and dust- ) rich , whereas by @xmath78 most of the gas has formed into stars . at yet higher redshifts ( @xmath79 ) the youth of the universe may preclude the production of enough obscuring dust for the quasar to be a luminous submm source ( priddey et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "expanding the redshift range of figure [ fig : lfirz ] in each direction is a project currently in progress , but at present it is intriguing that the average submillimetre loudness seems to decline when the population itself declines .",
    "a factor that we have _ not _ addressed in deriving this result is the influence of gravitational lensing . in common with many of bright submillimetre sources found in surveys ,",
    "it is likely that fluxes are boosted by lensing .",
    "this is likely to lead to bias , as the lensing optical depth increases with redshift ( e.g. barkana & loeb , 2000 ) .",
    "thus the @xmath3 sources are likely to be intrinsically fainter than they appear , relative to those at @xmath21 . considering individual sources , _",
    "hst _ stis imaging ( after the current data were obtained ) showed hs0810 + 2554 to be lensed into a quadruple source with a tight ( @xmath271 arcsec ) separation between the components ( reimers et al .",
    "this explains the extremely high infrared luminosity implied by its detection in the _ iras _ faint source catalogue .",
    "we stress that _ no corrections _ for lensing have been applied in the current work , for this is complex and model - dependent .",
    "however , this important issue will be tackled in quantitative detail in a future paper ( priddey et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , where we present a detailed statistical analysis of all recent jcmt / scuba and iram / mambo high - redshift quasar data .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the first results from a targetted scuba survey of optically - luminous ( @xmath1 ) , radio - quiet quasars at @xmath0 .",
    "this is a continuation of the scuba bright quasar survey whose preliminary results , at @xmath3 , were reported by isaak et al .",
    "the present data confirm the presence of a large scatter in the correlation between submm and optical luminosity , despite having minimized the errors in measurement of the latter .",
    "comparing the @xmath3 and @xmath71 datasets shows that there is no evidence for a variation of submm properties of luminous quasars across this redshift range , once one has allowed for a @xmath8-correction appropriate for cool , isothermal dust .",
    "however , there is a suggestion that the characteristic submm luminosity increases with redshift between @xmath80 and @xmath34 .",
    "we note that a companion survey , carried out at 1.2 mm with the mambo array on the iram 30 m telescope , reaches similar conclusions ( omont et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in forthcoming papers",
