    "this seems to be a singularity in ( [ 2.8 ] ) , but the curvature scalars are not singular there , as shown in appendix [ appnonsymm ] . also the set @xmath90 seems to be singular in ( [ 2.8 ] ) , but the same formulae in appendix [ appnonsymm ] show that it is nonsingular . hence , also in the general case there is no reason to treat these two sheets as disjoint ",
    "they are two coordinate coverings of the same surface .",
    "a hypersurface @xmath162 constant has the curvature tensor @xmath163 where @xmath164 .",
    "consequently , it is flat when @xmath165 and curved in every other case ( also when @xmath129 constant @xmath166 ) .",
    "however , ( [ 2.9 ] ) implies that with @xmath165 we have @xmath116 and @xmath92 ( recall : we consider only the case @xmath38 ) .",

    "the radius meant here is a _ coordinate radius _ that has no invariant meaning .",
    "the meaningful quantity is the geometric radius , which is the invariant distance between the center of the circle and a point on its circumference .",
    "it can be verified that the invariant distance between any pair of points is the same as the invariant distance between their images .",
    "below we present some remarks about the transformation ( [ 12.10 ] ) .",
    "the same statements apply to ( [ 12.11 ] ) .",
    "the jacobian of the transformation ( [ 12.10 ] ) is @xmath453 which , together with ( [ 12.14 ] ) , shows that the integrand in the integral @xmath454 is form - invariant under this transformation . in this",
    "integral , ( [ 12.10 ] ) is an ordinary change of variables , and the area of integration in the @xmath386 variables will be an image of the original area under the same transformation .",
    "this means that also the value of this integral is an invariant of ( [ 12.10 ] ) .",
    "thus , if we choose the region of integration to be a circle around a point , it does not matter where the center of the circle is because we can freely move the circle around the @xmath50 surface by symmetry transformations without changing its area .",
    "in the quasi - hyperbolic case , the @xmath50 surfaces are infinite , so they do not surround any finite volume .",
    "thus , unlike in the quasi - spherical case , we should not expect the value of the mass function @xmath0 to correspond to a mass contained in a well - defined volume .",
    "we should rather observe the analogy to a solid cylinder of finite radius and infinite length in newton s theory , in which the mass density depends only on the radial coordinate .",
    "its exterior gravitational potential is determined by a function that has the dimension of mass , whose value is proportional to mass contained in a unit of length of the cylinder .",
    "we now proceed by the same plan as we did in the quasi - spherical case .",
    "we can freely move a circle of integration around each @xmath50 surface .",
    "we first consider the hyperbolically symmetric case and we erect over a chosen circle a solid column in the @xmath31 direction that contains a certain amount of rest mass .",
    "then we go over to the quasi - hyperbolic nonsymmetric space and erect a wiggly column that contains the same amount of rest mass",
    ".    we will integrate over the interior of a circle in sheet 2 whose radius @xmath455 is , for the beginning , unknown .",
    "we only know that the radius must be smaller than @xmath358 , so that the integration region does not intersect the circle where @xmath90 ( since , we recall , @xmath90 is the image of infinity , and the integral over a region that includes @xmath90 would be infinite ) .",
    "thus , instead of ( [ 9.1 ] ) and ( [ 11.1 ] ) we have this time    @xmath456    the first integral in ( [ 13.1 ] ) will be independent of @xmath358 when @xmath455 is a fixed multiple of @xmath358 : @xmath457 then @xmath458 instead of ( [ 11.2 ] ) we now have : @xmath459    the meaning of the limits of integration has to be explained here . in the quasi - spherical case , and in the spherically symmetric lt subcase , one usually assumes that each space of constant @xmath2 has its center of symmetry , where @xmath460 . as explained at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sphermass ] , this is an additional assumption  the center of symmetry need not belong to the spacetime .",
    "but the center of symmetry , or origin , is the natural reference point at which the mass function has zero value . in the quasi - hyperbolic case",
    "now considered , a similar role is played by the set @xmath116 , so we will assume that this set exists .",
    "again , as mentioned earlier , this set is a 2-dimensional surface in each space of constant @xmath2 , and not a single point .",
    "with this assumption made , @xmath461 in ( [ 13.4 ] ) will be the value of @xmath31 at which @xmath462 .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath463 and @xmath464 $ ] are finite at @xmath465 and in a neighbourhood of @xmath461 , so that both integrals in ( [ 13.4 ] ) tend to zero as @xmath466 .",
    "these equations are very similar to the corresponding ones in the quasi - spherical case , ( [ 11.1 ] )  ( [ 11.2 ] ) , so one is tempted to interpret @xmath235 , by analogy with that case , as a quantity proportional to the active gravitational mass contained within a solid ( wiggly ) tube with circular sections , the radius of a circular section at @xmath189 being @xmath467 .",
    "the base of the tube is in the surface @xmath468 const , @xmath469 , its coordinate height is @xmath470 , and its top is at @xmath471 .",
    "there is no problem with this interpretation in the hyperbolically symmetric case , where @xmath472 and the second integral in ( [ 13.4 ] ) vanishes .",
    "however , there is a significant difficulty when going over to the quasi - hyperbolic case . in the quasi - spherical case we were free to take the limit of the integral extending over the whole sphere , which was @xmath473 . here , the integral over the whole hyperboloid would correspond to @xmath474 , and in this limit all the integrals ( [ 13.1 ] )  ( [ 13.4 ] ) become infinite .",
    "worse still , the contribution from the dipole  the second integral in ( [ 13.4 ] )  tends to infinity _ faster _ than the monopole component ( the first integral ) , while in the spherical case increasing the area of integration caused decreasing the influence of the dipole .",
    "we can do another operation on ( [ 13.4 ] ) that will shed some light on the meaning of @xmath235 .",
    "the volume of the region containing the rest mass @xmath348 is @xmath475 where @xmath338 is the determinant of the metric of the 3-dimensional subspace @xmath37 constant of ( [ 2.1 ] ) , thus @xmath476 this has the same structure as the integral representing @xmath348 .",
    "since @xmath102 and @xmath118 do not depend on @xmath331 and @xmath212 , the integration with respect to @xmath50 can be carried out , and by ( [ 13.1 ] )  ( [ 13.3 ] ) we get @xmath477 for the ratio @xmath478 we now calculate two consecutive limits : first @xmath474 , to cover the whole of each @xmath36 constant hyperboloid , and then @xmath479 , where @xmath480 is the value of @xmath31 at which @xmath481 , to cover the whole @xmath37 constant space . after taking the first limit",
