    "several mechanisms have been proposed to reproduce the observed @xmath17 distribution , which are based on dynamical interactions of various nature , such as interactions between the planet and a gaseous or planetesimal disk , planet - planet resonant interactions , close encounters between planets , or secular interactions with a distant companion star ( for a review see @xcite , and references therein ) , but none of them can represent alone the observed distribution in a natural way .",

    ". many models can reproduce such results , including reduced migration efficiency due to gap opening ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , substantial mass - loss through roche lobe overflow ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and accelerated orbital decay due to enhanced tidal interactions with the host stars ( @xcite ) .",

    "recent works ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) have conclusively shown that planet occurrence correlates strongly with the host stars primordial metallicity .",

    "gonzalez ( @xcite ) and queloz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) initially argued that metal - rich stars seem to possess an excess of very short - period planets with respect to other planet hosts .",
    "in later works ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) no trend was found .",
    "however , after removing some potential sources of bias , sozzetti ( @xcite ) has shown how this trend is still present in the data , specifically when one restricts the analysis to single planets orbiting single stars .",
    "if real , the @xmath33[fe / h ] correlation could either reflect the fact that migration rates are slowed down in metal - poor protoplanetary disks ( @xcite ) , or it might be indicative of longer timescales for giant planet formation around metal - poor stars , and thus reduced migration efficiency before the disk dissipates ( @xcite @xcite ) .    finally , planet frequency appears to correlate with the primary mass . in particular , as pointed out by e.g. butler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the occurrence rate of giant planets orbiting within 2 au around m dwarfs ( @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 ) seems suppressed by about an order of magnitude with respect to that of analogous planets around f- and g - type dwarfs ( @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath36 ) .",
    "the presently small number of giant planets discovered around m dwarfs might still be partly an artifact due to the small - number statistics ( @xcite @xcite ) . however , the observed trend is supported by theoretical arguments ( @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) for a strong dependence of planet occurrence rates on stellar mass , highlighted by a significantly suppressed probability of forming giant planets by core accretion around m dwarfs , and by an enhanced likelihood for m dwarfs to harbor neptune - sized objects .",
    "planet occurrence , on the other hand , may not be a strong function of the primary mass for objects formed by disk instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      some 10% of the planet hosts are found to be orbited by multiple systems , containing up to 4 planets , while @xmath39 of the planet - bearing stars are themselves components of wide multiple stellar systems , and in two of the latter cases the stars harbor multiple - planet systems .",

    "( @xcite ) compared visually the eccentricity and mass distributions of single planets and planetary systems , and concluded that no significant difference was apparent .",
    "finally , mazeh & zucker ( @xcite ) have recently presented arguments for a correlation between mass ratios and period ratios among pairs of planets in multiple systems ( assuming coplanarity of the orbits ) .    from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the overall impact of the presence of a secondary star on the efficiency of planet formation and migration is far from being clear .",
    "for example , nelson ( @xcite ) and mayer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) argue that giant planet formation by either core accretion or disk instability can be strongly inhibited in relatively close binary systems with separation of order of a few tens of aus .",
    "boss ( @xcite ) , however , comes to opposite conclusions . due to",
    "enhanced migration and gas accretion rates ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) planets formed around binaries should not show evidence for a mass - period correlation .",
    "these predictions appear to agree with the observed trend .",
    "theoretical investigations of the long - term dynamical evolution of multiple - planet systems ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ; @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite , and references therein ) have allowed to divide such systems in three broad classes : @xmath40 `` hierarchical '' planetary systems , with widely separated orbits , in which dynamical interactions appear negligible ; @xmath41 planetary systems subject to strong secular interactions ; @xmath42 planetary systems locked in mean motion resonances , which in some cases exhibit important variations of the orbital elements on time - scales comparable to the time - span of the radial - velocity monitoring . in multiple - planet systems , regions of dynamical stability do exist inside the parent stars habitable zones , where earth - sized planets may be found ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the detected giant planets in binaries are likely to reside in stable orbital configurations , and there are margins for the presence of rocky planets in the habitable zone of close binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ; @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) , although the formation of terrestrial planets in such environments does not easily occur in the first place ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the lack of information on the actual mutual inclination angles between pairs of planetary orbits somewhat limits the generality of these findings .",
    "a handful of hot jupiters ( @xmath43 days ) have been discovered by means of photometric transit surveys ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and confirmed by high - resolution spectroscopic measurements ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , while one , hd 209458b , was observed transiting ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite ) subsequently to the detection of its gravitational pull on the star ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of the doppler - shift and transit photometry measurements allows to derive estimates of the true mass and radius of the planet .",
    "these two critically interesting parameters can then be used for directly constraining structural models of irradiated giant planets ( see @xcite , and references therein , for a detailed review ) .",
    "the measured radii for six of the seven transiting planets provide good agreement with theoretical expectations , while all models seem to systematically underestimate the radius of hd 209458b .",
    "the recent successful detection of thermal emission in the infrared from the planet ( @xcite ) , and in particular the timing of the secondary eclipse , clearly suggests that the planet revolves on an orbit with no significant eccentricity , essentially ruling out mechanisms invoked to provide additional heat / power sources in the core , such as tidal dissipation of a nonzero eccentricity induced by the gravitational perturbation of an undetected long - period companion ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "transmission spectroscopy during transits has allowed to detect absorption features in the spectrum of hd 209458 which are indicative of the presence of various constituents in the planet s atmosphere , notably sodium , hydrogen , oxygen , and carbon ( @xcite ; @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "also , the planet appears to have an extended atmosphere , presumably due to evaporation effects . in two cases , detection of the planet s thermal emission",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) has permitted to estimate the planets effective temperatures and bond albedos , and to infer the presence of atmospheric water vapor and carbon monoxide .",
    "theoretical predictions of the atmospheric composition , temperature , and circulation of irradiated giant planets ( @xcite ; @xcite . for",
    "a review see @xcite ) are in fair agreement with the first infrared direct detections , however a proper understanding of the fine details of the emergent spectra of tres-1 and hd 209458b will require both improved modelling and larger , high - quality datasets .",
    "finally , studies of the phenomenon of atmospheric escape from hot jupiters ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) predict that , under strong irradiation , these objects , depending on their mass and orbital distance , could undergo significant evaporation of their gaseous envelope , in reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "the observational data on extrasolar planets show such striking properties that one must infer that planet formation and evolution is a very complex process .",
    "indeed , the confrontation between theory and observations indicates that there are numerous problems in connection with the elucidation of planetary formation and evolution processes .",
    "an ideal theory of planet formation and evolution should be capable of explaining in a self - consistent way , be it deterministic or probabilistic , all the different properties of planetary systems discussed above .",
    "to this end , the help from future data obtained with a variety of different techniques will be crucial .",
    "ultimately , both theory and observation will have to provide answers to a number of fundamental questions , that can be summarized as follows .",

    "( 2 ) what is the preferred method of gas giant planet formation ? ( 3 ) under which conditions does migration occur and stop ?",
    "( 4 ) what is the origin of the large planetary eccentricities ? ( 5 ) are multiple - planet orbits coplanar ? ( 6 ) how many families of planetary systems can be identified from a dynamical viewpoint ? ( 7 ) what are the atmospheres , inner structure and evolutionary properties of gas giant planets ?",
    "( 8) do stars with circumstellar dust disks actually shelter planets ? ( 9 ) what are the actual mass and orbital elements distributions of planetary systems ? ( 10 ) how do planet properties and frequencies depend upon the characteristics of the parent stars ( spectral type , age , metallicity , binarity / multiplicity ) ?    with the above questions in mind , i focus next on what the contribution of astrometry from ground and in space will be , by presenting a summary of methods and instrumentation , by reviewing past and present efforts , by discussing future prospects and by putting this technique in perspective with other planet - detection methods .",
    "astrometric detection of extrasolar planets can be conducted with instrumentation on the ground or in space .",
    "i describe in this section the generic approach to planet detection and measurement with astrometry , in terms of what type of data are needed , how to extract and model the planet signal from the data in presence of a number of noise sources , and how to assess the significance of a detection .",
    "i will conclude the section by summarizing results from a set of ground - based and space - borne experiments aimed at demonstrating the theoretical predictions on the achievable astrometric precision under a variety of conditions .",
    "the general analysis methods can be applied to astrometric observables appropriately defined for both monopupil and diluted - aperture telescopes , both from the ground and in space . to this end",
    ", i will describe the techniques in terms of the basic observable and noise models and the estimation process .",
    "the observable model produces theoretical values for the data as a function of adjustable parameters .",
    "the noise model describes errors that corrupt the astrometric data .",
    "the estimation process finds parameter values that produce the closest agreement between the observable model estimates and the data in light of the noise model .",
    "the astrometric observable is generally defined as the angular position of a star as measured by a given instrument in its local frame of reference .",
    "the measurement could be for example intrinsically one - dimensional , as is the case for space missions such as esa s @xmath44 ( @xcite ) and @xmath45 ( @xcite ) , which are designed to perform angular position measurements in their sensitive directions by centroiding their diffraction - limited images . or",
    ", it could be a set of two coordinates on the focal plane of the instrument , as is the case for ground - based telescopes ( e.g , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it could be either the optical path - length difference between the two arms of an interferometer on the ground ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or in space , such as nasa s space interferometry mission ( @xmath46 ; @xcite ) , or the normalized difference between the signals of two photomultiplier tubes ( the transfer function ) of a space - borne interferometer , such as @xmath47/fgs ( @xcite ) .    both from the ground and in space",
    ", astrometric measurements can be performed in wide - angle mode , i.e relative to a local frame of reference composed of a set of one or more reference stars at typical angular distances of several degrees from the target object . if the selected local reference frame lies at @xmath48 , the data are said to be collected while operating in narrow - angle mode . from space , without the limiting presence of atmospheric turbulence , which induces large - scale wavefront distortions ( @xcite ) , the astrometric observable can be determined with respect to a global inertial reference frame by accurately bridging together multi - epoch observations of objects distributed everywhere in the sky ( and thus separated by typically tens of degrees ) and by adopting a global closure condition over the whole celestial sphere .",
    "the combination of such an observing scenario and data reduction method is called global astrometric mode ( @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of the mode of operation and of the instrument utilized to carry out the measurements , four categories of information should be identified for inclusion in the observable model utilized to calculate theoretical values of the observable with negligible errors : ( 1 ) the location and motion of the target ( if working in global astrometric mode ) and a possible set of reference stars ( if working in wide - angle or narrow - angle mode ) , ( 2 ) the location and motion of the observing instrument ( if on the ground ) or the attitude of the spacecraft ( if in space ) , ( 3 ) the number , masses , and orbital parameters of companions to the target ( and reference stars where applicable ) , and ( 4 ) any physical effects that modify the apparent positions of stars .",
    "the star information consists of the five basic astrometric parameters ",
    "position on the celestial sphere ( 2 parameters , say @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , proper motion ( 2 parameters , say @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , and parallax ( 1 parameter , say @xmath53)plus the radial velocity @xmath54 , which can be determined by auxiliary measurements or from a sufficiently large secular acceleration .    the stellar locations and motions are usually determined in the solar - system barycentric frame in which the global frame is defined .",
    "a variety of transformations can be utilized to connect the instrument - specific observational frame to the stellar frame .    if the object s position in the instrument and barycentric frame are described by the vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , then for an all - sky survey instrument such as @xmath44 or @xmath45 the mapping is specified by the @xmath57 rotation matrix @xmath58 : @xmath59 from this relation , the along - scan angular coordinate of the object , which constitutes the actual observable , can be solved for in terms of @xmath58 and @xmath56 .",

    "alternatively , it could be described by means of the quaternion representation , as is presently envisioned for @xmath45 .    for an interferometer operating in wide - angle mode , both on the ground and in space",
    ", the measured optical path - length delay @xmath65 corresponds to the instantaneous three - dimensional position of the target on the sky projected onto the interferometer baseline : @xmath66 the baseline vector @xmath67 of length @xmath68 describes the spacecraft attitude , while @xmath69 is a constant term representing residual internal optical path differences . in the narrow - angle regime , this expression is modified as follows : @xmath70 the relative optical path - length delay @xmath71 is then the instantaneous angular distance between the target and its @xmath72th reference star projected onto @xmath73 . due to the differential nature of the measurement ,",
    "the constant term @xmath69 cancels out , to first order .",
    "finally , in order to relate the detector frame of a ground - based monolithic telescope or @xmath47/fgs to the actual coordinates of an object in the sky , a plate - reduction transformation is applied ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case , the two - dimensional standard cartesian coordinate vector @xmath74 describing the position of the target in the plane of the sky is mapped into the two - dimensional vector of measured coordinates on the detector @xmath75 via the transformation : @xmath76 in the above expression , @xmath77 is the model matrix : @xmath78 the column vector @xmath79 contains the so - called _ plate constants_. a minimum of six is required , to describe scale and rotation factors and offsets of coordinate origins between the two frames of reference , but it is not uncommon to include focal - plane tilt and other optical distortion terms , in addition to terms dependent on the magnitude and color index of the star observed .",

    "jupiter - sized planets already produce perturbative effects whose size is smaller than the typical @xmath44 milli - arcsecond ( mas ) measurement precision .",
    "detection of orbital motion induced by terrestrial planets necessarily implies an improvement of 2 - 3 orders of magnitude in precision , down to the few micro - arcseond ( @xmath91as ) regime .",
    "finally , in the case for example of a multiple - planet system , simply considering independent keplerian orbits might not be sufficient , whenever secular or resonant gravitational perturbations among planets in the systems ( due to the presence of large mass ratios , highly eccentric orbits , commensurabilities between orbital periods , and significantly non - coplanar orbits ) are strong enough to induce measurable variations of orbital elements over time - scales comparable to the time - span of observations .",
    "for these cases , additional information must be fed to the observable model , such as approximate analytical expressions describing the gravitational perturbations and consequent time variations of the orbital elements , or fully self - consistent fitting algorithms which include the direct solution of the equations of motion of an n - body system .",
    "a variety of physical effects that cause the apparent coordinates of observed stars to differ from the transformed values of their true barycentric coordinates can be taken into account in principle . in order to understand which effects are more relevant , the driver is the limiting single - measurement precision the adopted instrument is designed to achieve .",

    "the positional error @xmath169 due to atmospheric turbulence is weakly dependent on separation and does not depend on @xmath119 ( or @xmath68 ) .",

    "the rather weak power dependency of @xmath169 on target - reference star separation and objective diameter implies that a typical value @xmath173 mas is obtained with @xmath130 m in @xmath174 hr of integration with a separation @xmath175 arcmin . in order to suppress @xmath169 by two - three orders of magnitude one would require unrealistically large @xmath119 and @xmath123 , unless @xmath103 is limited to uselessly small angles .",
    "interferometers can in principle get much closer to the limits in precision set by the atmosphere . for a diluted architecture , in fact , eq .",
    "[ linde ] now reads @xmath176 .",
    "values of @xmath68 of order of 100 - 200 meters are more easily attainable than the equivalent filled - aperture size .",
    "thus , for a 20-arcsec star separation and a 200-m baseline , a 1-hr integration would allow to achieve @xmath177 @xmath91as ( @xcite ) . in conditions of extremely favorable seeing , large isoplanatic angles , and long atmospheric coherence times , such as those reported above dome c in antarctica ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , atmospheric errors in image motion maybe reduced by another order of magnitude",
    ".    however , if phase - referencing is used to artificially increase @xmath134 and the limiting @xmath178 , additional noise sources are introduced . in particular , coherence losses occur due to fluctuations in the fringe position during integration , which induce in turn a visibility reduction by a factor @xmath179 ( where @xmath180 is a measure of jitter in the referenced phase .",

    "this in turn limits the achievable @xmath120 in a given @xmath134 , thus contributing to increase @xmath116 .",
    "these time - dependent effects can be divided into two classes , namely instrument - specific errors in the determination of the phase , and those that are due one more time to atmospheric propagation effects . the dominant effect ( @xcite @xcite ) is again induced by dcr . for large values of @xmath166 , @xmath181 , thus applications of this technique are likely to be restricted to moderate zenith angles , depending on wavelength and seeing .",
    "while the abovementioned error sources can be to some extent dealt with and reduced , in order to progress toward the goal of a few @xmath91as precision , astrophysical noise sources ( due to the environment or intrinsic to the target ) can not be easily minimized , if present .",
    "for example , i show in figure  [ gravpull ] the comparison between the gravitational perturbations ( as seen along one of the two axes in the plane of the sky as a function of time ) induced by a 5 @xmath2 and a 0.1 @xmath36 companion to a 1 @xmath36 star with periods of 5 yr and 100 yr , respectively , with the system at a distance @xmath182 pc from the sun .",
    "as one can see from the right panel of the figure , on a time - scale short compared to the orbital period of the stellar companion , the astrometric signature of the planet is superposed to a large effect .",
    "the additional signal in the data could be easily misinterpreted as an extra proper motion component or as a significant acceleration , depending on the orbital characteristics of the long - period companion and epochs of observation .",
    "as i mentioned earlier , if the orbital characteristics of the perturbing stellar companion around a target and/or reference star(s ) are known to exist in advance , they can be modelled within the context of the observable model .",
    "the dynamical effect of a previously unknown stellar companion constitutes otherwise a significant source of noise that might hamper the reliability of orbit reconstruction for a newly detected planet .",
    "such a problem will affect primarily future high - precision space - borne global astrometric missions such as @xmath45 , which will not have the luxury to pre - select the list of targets . in the case of relative astrometry , if feasible , one could require that the objects composing the local frame of reference not be orbited by stellar companions inducing unmodelled signatures larger than a few @xmath91as . a typical strategy to achieve",
    "this , adopted for example for the selection of the grid stars for @xmath46 , is to look for reference objects that are k giants , and pre - select them on the basis of medium - precision radial - velocity monitoring . in this case , the typically large distance of these stars ( 1 kpc ) implies ( provided they are not too faint , otherwise photon noise becomes an issue ) a significant suppression of any astrometric signature that might significantly pollute the potential planetary signal from the target ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "another source of astrophysical noise due to the environment is the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "the motion of the center of mass of the disk , provoked by the excitation of spiral density waves by an embedded planet , induces an additional wobble in the stellar position , while time - variable , asymmetric starlight scattering by the disk can introduce shifts in the photocenter position .",
    "takeuchi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have recently studied these effects assuming jupiter - mass planets embedded in gravitationally stable circumstellar disks around young solar - type stars at the distance of the taurus - auriga star - forming region ( @xmath183 pc ) .",
    "they conclude that the additional stellar motion caused dynamically by the disk s gravity is negligible ( sub-@xmath91as ) with respect to the signature from the planet ( @xmath184 @xmath91as if the planet s semi - major axis is 5 au ) .",
    "variable disk illumination can induce peak - to - peak photocenter variations of order 10 - 100 @xmath91as , but they claim that @xmath46 would not be sensitive to such excursions . finally , boss ( @xcite ) and rice et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have quantified the magnitude of the astrometric displacement induced dynamically by a marginally unstable disk .",

    "the last important class of astrophysical noise sources that can cause shifts in the observed photocenter is not due to stellar environment but rather intrinsic to the target .",
    "such noise sources include a variety of surface temperature inhomogeneities such as spots and flares , and just like disks , they are primarily characteristic of rapidly rotating , young stellar objects ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .    in the context of a study of the effects of the variety of astrophysical sources of astrometric noise on the planet detection capabilities of @xmath45 ( sozzetti et al .",

    "the key result of the numerical analysis ( figure  [ spots ] ) is that a photometric variation in the visual of @xmath186 ( rms ) corresponds to an astrometric variation of @xmath129 @xmath91as ( rms ) in the position of a 1 @xmath187 pre - main sequence star at the distance of taurus ( @xmath188 pc ) .",
    "the magnitude of the spot - induced photocenter motion on a t tauri star is thus comparable to the gravitational effect of a jupiter - mass object orbiting the star at 0.5 au ( @xmath189 @xmath91as ) .",
    "the effect scales with distance just like the astrometric signature of a planet , thus for a nearby , less active sun - like star at 10 pc its magnitude could still be of the same order ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while the amplitude of the planet - induced stellar motion would be at least one order of magnitude larger .    however , astrometric signatures induced for example by a few earth - mass planet on a 1 au orbit around a solar - type star at a distance of 10 pc covered by spots causing a change in photospheric flux of @xmath190 could be comparable in size",
    ". the non - uniformity of illumination of the stellar disk might then jeopardize successful earth - sized planet detection with astrometry around the nearest stars , as well the detection of jupiter - sized objects in nearby star - forming regions .",
    "fortunately , large spotted areas on solar - type stars are relatively uncommon ( the sun itself , at its peak of activity , is covered by spots for up to @xmath191% of its visible surface .",
    "see for example @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the spot - induced photocenter variation has a period that is strongly correlated to the photometric excursion as well as the stellar rotation period ( of order of a few days for t tauri stars , up to several weeks for solar - type objects ) . with the help of careful photometric monitoring , the two sources of astrometric signal",
    "might then be successfully disentangled .",
    "ultimately , in order to keep environmental and intrinsic astrophysical noise sources at the few @xmath91as level , an important cause of concern primarily for giant planet searches in star - forming regions , it would be beneficial to avoid stars with large photometric variations and objects with particularly large , flared disks .",

    "i show in figure  [ coplan ] the estimated accuracy with which @xmath46 could determine the coplanarity ( i.e. , @xmath315 ) between pairs of planetary orbits as a function of the common inclination angle , for 11 known multiple - planet systems .    for configurations in which all components produce @xmath316",
    ", coplanarity could be established with typical uncertainties of a few degrees , for periods up to twice the mission duration . in systems where at least one component has @xmath317 ,",
    "accurate coplanarity measurements are compromised , and mutual inclinations can only be determined with uncertainties of several tens of degrees .    finally ,",
    "if combined radial velocity + astrometric solutions were to be carried out on single- or multiple - planet systems , the quality of orbit reconstruction and mass determination would be significantly improved , especially in the long period regime ( @xmath296 ) and for edge - on configurations , while well - sampled , well - measured orbits ( @xmath295 , @xmath318 ) would be only marginally improved by radial velocity + astrometric solutions ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the convergence of non - linear fitting procedures and the quality of orbital solutions can both be significantly affected by the choice of the starting guesses . in the absence of any kind of _ a priori _ information on the actual presence of planets around a given target",
    ", all orbital parameters will have to be derived from scratch .",
    "the results of , e.g. , han et al .",
    "( @xcite ) already provided a word of caution on the reliability of low @xmath319 astrometric orbits , even when constraints on some of the parameters are available from spectroscopy .",
    "it is thus crucial to investigate new strategies in the fitting procedure to maximize the robustness of the solutions obtained .",
    "pourbaix ( @xcite ) tackled the problem in the context of a work on the precision achievable on the orbital parameters of astrometric binaries from two- and one - dimensional observations , in the case of low @xmath319 .",
    "he proposed a two - dimensional global grid search approach in the ( @xmath17 , @xmath84 ) space coupled to a guess on @xmath16 by means of a period search technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while fitting a linearized model in the four thiele - innes elements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "konacki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) applied a ` frequency decomposition ' method to simulated @xmath46 observations of @xmath257 and .",
    "this approach is based on a fourier expansion of the keplerian motion , in which the coefficients of the successive harmonics are functions of all orbital elements .",
    "the values of the latter obtained from the linear least squares solution performed with the fourier expansion are then utilized as starting guesses of a local minimization of the non - linear problem .",
    "this method avoids the complications of a global - search approach in several dimensions , which can be computationally very intensive .",
    "however , the authors did not attempt to validate their approach in cases departing from the favorable ( @xmath295 , @xmath318 ) configuration studied .",
    "the most detailed study on this subject is the one currently carried out by the @xmath45 planetary systems working group .",
    "lattanzi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have recently presented preliminary results of an on - going , large - scale double - blind test campaign that has been set up in order to provide a realistic assessment of the @xmath45 capabilities in detecting extra - solar planets .",
    "the double - blind test protocol envisions three distinct groups of participants .",
    "the simulators define and generate simulated observations of stars with and without planets with a @xmath45-like satellite ; the solvers define detection tests , with levels of statistical significance of their own choice , and orbital fitting algorithms , using any local , global , or hybrid solution method that they devise is best ; the evaluators compare simulations and solutions and draw a first set of conclusions on the process .    as an illustrative example",
    ", figure  [ doubleblind ] shows one of the results of a simulation of 50,000 stars orbited by a single planet having @xmath320 yr , and producing @xmath321 .",
    "the present - day @xmath45 scanning - law is utilized , with a single - measurement precision @xmath322 @xmath91as .",
    "the plot shows how the derived periods by one of the solvers compare to the true simulated ones .",
    "the most striking result is the ability to derive very accurate estimates of the period for @xmath323 yr , for the full range of @xmath292 and for all possible values of @xmath324 and @xmath325 . for periods exceeding the mission duration by over 20% , it becomes increasingly difficult to identify the correct value of @xmath16 . in this case ,",
    "part of the signal can be absorbed in the stellar proper motion , with the net result that the size and period of the perturbation are systematically underestimated .    however , the preliminary findings by lattanzi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that ` mission - ready ' detection and orbital fit packages ( including reliable estimates of the covariance matrix of the solutions ) tailored to future high - precision astrometric observatories , requiring no _ a priori _ knowledge of the orbital elements , can already achieve good performances .",
    "the classic way to gauge the effectiveness of different planet search techniques is to compare their respective discovery spaces , defined in terms of the planets of given mass and period each method will be able to detect . as an illustrative example ,",
    "i show in figure  [ discovery ] the @xmath86-@xmath16 diagram with the plotted present - day sensitivities of transit photometry and radial - velocity , and with the expected @xmath46 and @xmath45 detection thresholds at 10 pc and 150 pc , respectively . for the radial - velocity detection curve the simulations by sozzetti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) were utilized , while for @xmath46 and @xmath45 the sozzetti et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) results were used .",
    "the sensitivity for transit photometry was derived based on the gaudi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) analytical dependence of the detectable planet radius @xmath326 on @xmath327 ( converted to @xmath328 assuming constant planet density ) , under the ( naive ) hypothesis of uniform sampling",
    ".    simply taking at face value the curves of figure  [ discovery ] , however , can lead to important misunderstandings on the intrinsic relevance of the different techniques to planetary science .",
    "for example , the sensitivity of photometric techniques to transiting planets with @xmath329 days is strongly suppressed , and this detection method is useless if the planet does not transit . however , the information this technique provides for the very close - in objects discovered is extremely valuable , and it can not be provided by radial - velocity and astrometry .    a more effective way to proceed is then to gauge the relative importance of different planet detection techniques by looking at their discovery potential not _",
    "per se _ , but rather in connection to outstanding questions to be addressed and answered in the science of planetary systems , such as those i illustrated at the end of section 2 .",
    "i summarize below some of the most important issues for which @xmath91as astrometry will play a key role .",
    "the holy grail in extra - solar planet science is clearly the direct detection and characterization of earth - sized , habitable planets , with atmospheres where bio - markers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) might be found that could give clues on the possible presence of life forms .",
    "imaging terrestrial planets is presently the primarily science goal of the coronagraphic and interferometric configurations of the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ; @xcite ) , and of the darwin mission ( @xcite ) .",
    "space - borne transit photometry carried out with @xmath330 ( @xcite ) or @xmath331 ( @xcite @xcite ) has the potential to be the first technique to make such a detection .",
    "however , astrometry of all nearby stars within 10 - 20 pc from the sun at the @xmath91as level ( with @xmath46 and @xmath45 in space , and possibly with keck - i and vlti from the ground ) will be an essential ingredient in order to be able to provide darwin / tpf with a ) systems containing _ bona fide _ terrestrial , habitable planets ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , and b ) a comprehensive database of f - g - k - m stars with and without detected giant planets orbiting out to a few au from which to choose additional targets based on the presence or absence of jupiter signposts ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "such measurements will uniquely complement ongoing and planned radial - velocity programs aiming at @xmath332 m s@xmath94 precision ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and exo - zodiacal dust emission observations from the ground with keck - i , lbti , and vlti .      as discussed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 , planet properties ( orbital elements and mass distributions , and correlations amongst them ) and frequencies are likely to depend upon the characteristics of the parent stars ( spectral type , age , metallicity , binarity / multiplicity ) .",
    "it is thus desirable to be able to provide as large a database as possible of stars screened for planets .",
    "the size of the stellar sample screened for planets by an all - sky astrometric survey such as @xmath45 ( @xcite @xcite ) could be of order of a few hundred thousand relatively bright ( @xmath333 ) stars with a wide range of spectral types , metallicities , and ages out to @xmath0 pc .",
    "the sample - size is thus comparable to that of planned space - borne transit surveys , such as @xmath330 and @xmath331 .",
    "the statistical value of such a sample is better understood when one considers that , depending on actual giant planet frequencies as a function of spectral type and orbital distance , at least a few thousand planets could be detected and measured ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this number is comparable to the present - day size of the target lists of ground - based doppler surveys .",
    "finally , the ranges of orbital parameters and planet host characteristics probed by an all - sky astrometric planet survey would crucially complement both transit observations ( which strongly favor short orbital periods and are subject to stringent requisites on favorable orbital alignment ) , and radial - velocity measurements ( which can be less effectively carried out for stars covering a wide range of spectral types , metallicities , and ages and do not allow to determine either the true planet mass or the full three - dimensional orbital geometry ) .",
    "the competing giant - planet formation models make very different predictions regarding formation time - scales , planet mass ranges , and planet frequency as a function of host star characteristics .",
    "furthermore , correlations between orbital elements and masses , and possibly between the former and some of the host star characteristics ( metallicity ) might reflect the outcome of a variety of migration processes and their possible dependence on environment ( see sections 2.1 and 2.2 ) .",
    "these predictions could be tested on firm statistical grounds by extending planet surveys to large samples of pms objects and field metal - poor stars .",
    "the full sample of @xmath334 relatively bright ( @xmath333 ) , nearby ( @xmath335 pc ) , field metal - poor stars presently known could be screened for giant planets on wide orbits by @xmath45 or @xmath46 , thus complementing the shorter - period ground - based spectroscopic surveys ( @xcite @xcite ) , which are also limited in the sample sizes due to the intrinsic faintness and weakness of the spectral lines of the targets .",
    "these data combined would allow for improved understanding of the behavior of the probability of planet formation in the low - metallicity regime , by direct comparison between large samples of metal - poor and metal - rich stars , in turn putting stringent constraints on the proposed planet formation models . disproving or confirming the existence of the @xmath16-[fe / h ] correlation would also help to understand whether metallicity plays a significant role in the migration scenarios for giant planets .",
    "high - precision astrometric measurements of at least a few hundred relatively bright ( @xmath336 ) pms stars in a dozen of nearby ( @xmath337 pc ) star - forming regions could be carried out with @xmath46 and @xmath45 , searching for planets orbiting at 1 - 5 au .",
    "the possibility to determine the epoch of giant planet formation in the protoplanetary disk would provide the definitive observational test to distinguish between the proposed theoretical models .",
    "these data would uniquely complement near- and mid - infrared imaging surveys ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) for direct detection of young , bright , wide - separation ( @xmath338 au ) giant planets .",
    "the different sources of dynamical interactions proposed to explain the highly eccentric orbits of planetary systems ( see section 2.1 ) give rise to significantly different orbital alignments .",
    "an effective way to understand their relative roles would involve measuring the relative inclination angle between pairs of planetary orbits .",
    "studies addressing the long - term dynamical stability issue for multiple - planet systems , as well as the possibility of formation and survival of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of the parent star ( see section 2.3 ) , would also greatly benefit from knowledge of whether pairs of planetary orbits are coplanar or not .",
    "the only way to provide meaningful estimates of the full three - dimensional geometry of _ any _ planetary system ( without restrictions on the orbital alignment with respect to the line of sight ) is through direct estimates of the mutual inclinations angles using high - precision astrometry ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) . for a @xmath45-like , all - sky survey instrument , the database of potential targets out to 50 - 60 pc is of order of a few tens of thousand objects ( @xcite @xcite ) . these data , combined with those available from doppler measurements and transit photometry and transit timing ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ,",
    "would then allow to put studies of the dynamical evolution of planetary systems on firmer grounds .      despite several decades of attempts , and a few recent successes , astrometric measurements with milli - arcsecond precision",
    "have so far proved of limited utility when employed as a tool to search for planetary mass companions orbiting nearby stars .",
    "however , an improvement of 2 - 3 orders of magnitude in achievable measurement precision , down to the few @xmath91as level , would allow this technique to achieve in perspective the same successes of the doppler method , for which the improvement from the km s@xmath94 to the few m s@xmath94 precision opened the doors for ground - breaking results in planetary science .    in this paper",
    "i have reviewed a series of technological , statistical , and astrophysical issues that future ground - based as well as space - borne efforts will have to face in their attempts to discover planets . at the @xmath91as precision level , independently on the type of instrument utilized ( either filled- or diluted aperture telescopes ) , a number of important modifications to the standard definition of astrometric observable ( the stellar position in the instrument - specific reference frame ) will have to be introduced , such as subtle effects due to general relativity .",
    "astrophysical noise sources will have to be taken into account , which may mimic the presence of a planet , such as significant stellar surface activity .",
    "several tools will have to be considered when attempting to derive reliable orbital solutions , such as optimized strategies to find good initial configurations for the orbital parameters .",
    "however , the greatest challenge will be to build instrumentation , both from ground ( keck - i , vlti ) and in space ( @xmath46 and @xmath45 ) , capable of attaining the technologically demanding requirements to achieve a targeted single - measurement precision @xmath339 @xmath91as . provided",
    "these will be met , astrometry during the next decade bears the potential to provide critical contributions to planetary science , which are crucially needed in order to complement the expectations from other indirect and direct planet detection methods , and refined theoretical understanding , for continuous improvements in the field of the formation and evolution of planetary systems .    during the preparation of this manuscript ,",

    "<S> first , i briefly summarize the properties of the present - day sample of extrasolar planets , in connection with predictions from theoretical models of planet formation and evolution . </S>",
    "<S> next , the generic approach to planet detection with astrometry is described , with significant discussion of a variety of technical , statistical , and astrophysical issues to be faced by future ground - based as well as space - borne efforts in order to achieve the required degree of measurement precision . after a brief summary of past and present efforts to detect planets via milli - arcsecond astrometry , </S>",
    "<S> i then discuss the planet - finding capabilities of future astrometric observatories aiming at micro - arcsecond precision . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , i outline a number experiments that can be conducted by means of high - precision astrometry during the next decade , to illustrate its potential for important contributions to planetary science , in comparison with other indirect and direct methods for the detection and characterization of planetary systems . </S>"
