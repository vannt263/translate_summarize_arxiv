    "classical geometrical representation of quantum field theory is recognized to be a milestone to construct quantum gravity theory .",
    "a well - known example is the anti - de sitter spacetime / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence  @xcite .",
    "now our interest is to understand this kind of problem with the help of information theoretical concepts .",
    "two of key concepts are quantum entanglement and holography . for instance , the entanglement entropy in the cft side can be holographically mapped onto a geometrical object like a minimal surface in the classical ads side  @xcite .",
    "an important viewpoint inherent in this mapping is how to storage quantum data into classical spacetime that reflects symmetry of the original quantum system .",
    "recently , it has gradually been recognized that the information geometry may be also a powerful tool for examining the above problem  @xcite . in this geometry ,",
    "the fisher metric plays a central role on deeply understanding quantum / classical or micro / macro correspondence .",
    "this is because the fisher metric creates a parameter space defined by a probability distribution ( this space becomes spacetime when the distribution is time - dependent ) , and usually the distribution characterizes our starting quantum or microscopic model . in other words",
    ", this method naturally provides us with a correspondence from a microscopic system to classical geometry .",
    "therefore , we can easily imagine that the method gives us information - theoretical interpretation of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "detailed examination of these arguments is the central purpose of this paper .    in more physical standpoints , geometrical approaches based on the fisher information",
    "have not only been used for several optimization theories , but have been already applied to thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution of thermodynamics is the boltzmann distribution , which belongs to the so - called exponential family . in this case",
    ", the corresponding geometry becomes quite simple  @xcite , and we can see some physical meanings hidden in the geometrical representation .",
    "it has actually been found that the scaler curvature is related to the inverse of the free energy , when we regard inverse temperature and chemical potential as two independent coordinates in the parameter space . since the free energy changes drastically near critical points",
    ", the curvature can detect criticality in the microscopic side .",
    "this feature reminds us of some similarity to the ads / cft correspondence in the sense that the classical side can capture criticality of the quantum side .",
    "furthermore , a close relationship between multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) and ads / cft correspondence has been also examined recently by the bures or fidelity metric which is also basically equivalent to the fisher information  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the metric of the mera network is actually ads .",
    "the author has also examined the finite - temperature extention of the mera network  @xcite with great help of some notions of quantum entanglement , and this network structure coinsides with the black hole configuration in the ads spacetime .",
    "these two findings are also important for understanding quantum / classical correspondence in terms of entanglement entropy and its holography .    a direct motivation of this work originates in entanglement thermodynamics in which we examine the first variation of the entanglement entropy  @xcite .",
    "this idea leads to the so - called entropy - energy relation that is a kind of generalized first law of thermodynamics .",
    "it has been shown that the gravitational interpretation of the entropy - energy relation actually leads to the linearized einstein equation .",
    "however , we will later see that the second derivative of the entanglement entropy , not the first derivative , is a crucial factor in the information geometry , and thus the previous results would be improved to find full einstein equation  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these previous works , we perform detailed analysis of geometric structure and dynamics of spacetime spanned by the fisher metric with exponential family form of a probability distribution . in this case",
    ", the fisher metric can be given by the second derivative of the hessian potential that is basically equivalent with the entanglement entropy .",
    "thus , finding a correct form of the hessian potential in the exponential family representation is crucial . as a typical example of cft",
    ", we start with spatially one - dimensional ( 1d ) free fermions , and we will see that their entanglement spectrum coinsides with the exponential family form  @xcite . at the same time , it is crucial to notice that the canonical parameters of the exponential family form are nontrivial functions of original model parameters ( partial system size , filling fraction , and time ) . after this important finding , we can derive the correct form of the hessian potential as a function of the canonical parameters , and can prove that the potential can be identified with the entanglement entropy .",
    "we then find that the fisher metric becomes hyperbolic ( ads with imaginary time ) after further general coordinate transformation .",
    "we emphasize crucial importance of finding correct coordinate transformations among original model parameters in the quantum side , canonical parameters in the exponential family form , and the final ads metric .",
    "we will mention the presence of the concept of bulk / boundary correspondence in the present information geometry .",
    "furthermore , when we consider some deformation of the spectrum near the conformal fixed point , the deformation is mapped onto dynamics of the spacetime , and this can be represented by the einstein equation .",
    "we can introduce the fictitious energy - monentum tensor , and the tensor originates in the lagrangian in which the free scaler field is equal to the embedded entropy data .",
    "therefore , we argue that the einstein equation in the emergent spacetime is a kind of equation of state of the original quantum system .",
    "all of the present results strongly suggest that the information geometry is quite powerful to understand detailed structure of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the fisher metric . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss about details of exponential family form and also mention that the entanglement spectrum for 1d free fermions consides with this form . in sec .",
    "iv , we examine geometric structure spanned by this metric , and find information - geometrical meaning of the einstein equation in the emergent spacetime .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary part .",
    "in the theory of information geometry , we start with a probability distribution @xmath0 that depends on a discrete stochastic variable @xmath1 and an internal parameter set @xmath2 . later , we will discuss that the distribution is defined from entanglement properties of quantum systems .",
    "we are going to construct an information space spanned by the coordinates @xmath3 , into which the data of @xmath0 are embedded . in convenience , we call this space as information space . however , in some cases , this can be a kind of spacetime , since the original data may be dynamical and time - dependent .",
    "hereafter , we assume that we can differentiate @xmath0 by @xmath3 as many as possible .",
    "a well - known case is gaussian in which the average and the variance are two internal parameters defining this distribution .",
    "the probability distribution obeys the following relation @xmath4 for later convenience , we abbreviate the expectation value of a distribution function @xmath5 by the angle bracket as @xmath6 where we omit the index @xmath3 in the bracket and use the bold symbol . by defining the spectrum as @xmath7 the information entroy",
    "is then given by @xmath8 this is one of key parameters in this paper .",
    "the fisher metric is derived from the kullback - leibler divergence @xmath9 .",
    "the divergence measures difference between two similar probability distributions .",
    "the divergence is given by @xmath10 this divergence is not symmetric for the exchange between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , but the second - order of its tayler expansion has better properties as a measure of the distance .",
    "actually , we can derive the following result @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the so - called fisher metric defined by @xmath15 roughly speaking , the metric is a kind of two - point correlation function of entropy variation in the information space .",
    "the diagonal parts of the metric are all positive , since @xmath16 .",
    "now , we consider whether the information geometrical approach can capture some basic features of the ads / cft correspondence , and thus we would like to find the origin of the classical coordinates in the quantum side .",
    "the line element squared has lorentzian signature as well as a warp factor that characterized conformal invariance .",
    "therefore , the positive sign property indicates that we need to take imaginary time when the original quantum system evolves in time and the time coordinate is mapped onto one of @xmath3 .",
    "hereafter , we consider the @xmath17-dimensional information spacetime , and we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an inverse matrix of @xmath20 .",
    "the fisher metric has an another form .",
    "let us start with eq .",
    "( [ conservation ] ) , @xmath21 . differentiating both sides of this equation by @xmath22",
    ", we obtain @xmath23 one more differentiation by @xmath24 leads to @xmath25 thus we have two different representations of the fisher metric .",
    "it should be noted that these two before taking the statistical avarage are not the same @xmath26 this means that the classical spacetime is emerged from averaging procedures of quantum - mechanically fluctuating states .",
    "when we start with general definition of the fisher metric in eq .",
    "( [ fisher2 ] ) , the corresponding geometry is quite complicated and it is hard to extract some physical information .",
    "thus , it is necessary to specify our target model .",
    "however , the geometry becomes simple for a particular choice of the distribution function .",
    "that is the so - called exponential family form .",
    "as is well known , the resulting classical spacetime is described by the hessian geometry , not the general riemaniann geometry  @xcite .",
    "the exponential family form is represented by the following probability distribution @xmath27 where @xmath3 is called canonical ( natural ) parameter . in this definition",
    ", @xmath28 only depends on the index @xmath1 , and @xmath29 only depends on @xmath3 .",
    "the exponential family covers very wide classes of probability distributions .",
    "as already mentioned , the boltzmann distribution is typical one for this class  @xcite .",
    "the distribution is given by @xmath30 with inverse temperature @xmath31 , and for example @xmath31 normalized by the interaction parameter and @xmath32 with the chemical potential @xmath33 are mapped onto two classical coordinates in the information space .",
    "the function @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 , and corresponds to a potential function . in the next subsection , we will discuss applicability of this distribution to the physics of quantum entanglement .",
    "an important question is whether the entanglement spectrum @xmath0 is a member of the exponential family or not . to characterize the entanglement by the reduced density matrix , we truncate environmental degrees of freedom",
    "this procedure provides mixed - state feature , and we can expect that this would lead to the exponential family form . in the present stage , we do not have quite general solution for this problem , but in some specific cases we can actually find positive answers for this question .",
    "hereafter , we consider 1d free fermions ( or equivalently xy model owing to the presence of jordan - wigner transformation ) .",
    "since the 1d fermion model is typical conformally - invariant one , we may generalize the following approach in terms of cft .",
    "let us more precisely formulate our model .",
    "we start with a quantum state @xmath36 defined on @xmath37-dimensional flat minkowski spacetime @xmath38 .",
    "we devide the whole system into two spatial regions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and denote the size of subsystem @xmath39 as @xmath41 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the whole system @xmath42 is defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are spinless fermion s creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "we suppose that our quantum state @xmath36 is in the ground state of this hamiltonian , @xmath47 with the ground - state energy @xmath48 , or a time - dependent state at time @xmath49 with this hamiltonian after some perturbation @xmath50 to a quantum state @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 . according to the deomposition of the whole system into two spatial regions , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we represent @xmath36 by the schmidt decomposition as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the schmidt bases for two subsystems @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "we normalize the schmidt coefficients or the singular values @xmath56 so that @xmath36 is normalized as @xmath57 the density matrix of the whole system is defined by @xmath58 . the reduced density matrix for subsystem @xmath39 is represented by tracing over environmental degrees of freedom as @xmath59 thus , the square of the schmidt coefficient is the eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix . usually , we transform the above equation as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the so - called entanglement hamiltonian or modular hamiltonian ( normalized by the entanglement temperature ) , @xmath62 , and @xmath35 . as we have already mentioned , this formally coinsides with the thermal distribution form .",
    "our proposal is that the entanglement spectrum @xmath0 for free fermions actually has the exponential family form .",
    "it is clear that the spectrum is a function of subsystem size @xmath41 , filling fraction @xmath63 , and time @xmath49 if the system evolves in time .",
    "however , a question is how to determine the correspondence between canonical parameters @xmath3 and the original model parameters @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 it is important to notice that this is highly nontrivial correspondence , because the entanglement hamiltonian @xmath66 for subsystem @xmath39 appears as a result of truncation of @xmath40 . in general ,",
    "the truncation process induces complicated nonlocal interactions .    in the free fermion case",
    ", we are going to propose that the canonical parameters should be given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a scaling function with @xmath69 and @xmath70 is a pseudo - fermi level which will be explained in detail .",
    "the prime index in @xmath71 represents derivative by @xmath72 .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 is a unit of time that will be determined .",
    "the parameter @xmath74 corresponds to the radial axis of the hyperbolic space ( ads with euclidean signature ) .",
    "this nontrivial mapping is crucial to examine emergent geometry from entanglement spectrum .",
    "the main purpose in half of this paper is to prove this property .",
    "we explain why eq .  ( [ t123 ] ) is a reasonable choice .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the reduced density matrix for free fermions is factorized as @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the mixed state of mode @xmath77 , @xmath78 is a number operator of a fermion at mode @xmath77 , and @xmath79 is its energy ( this fermion is different from that in the original model ) .",
    "the operator @xmath80 is nothing but the entanglement hamiltonian . in refs .",

    ", we can consider a situation in which the pseudo - energy level @xmath77 is completely occupied up to the pseudo - fermi level @xmath70 .",
    "the basic properties of the scaling function are @xmath91 at half - filling @xmath92 , @xmath71 is an odd function , and this symmetry is violated away from half - filling .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry is more important here . by using these relations",
    ", we can evaluate the dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath63 on the eigenvalue spectra @xmath93 for the full reduced density matrix @xmath89 .",
    "we consider the difference between the first and second largest eigenvalues .",
    "their corresponding spectra are respectively given by @xmath94 and the difference @xmath95 is evaluated as @xmath96 accodring to eq .",
    "( [ efamily ] ) , taking the difference removes contribution from the hessian potential , and then @xmath97 note that we can generalize the right hand side by adding a dummy index @xmath98 so that @xmath99 with @xmath100",
    ". in this case , eq .  ( [ difg ] ) is expanded as @xmath101 here the second derivative @xmath102 is zero at half - filling @xmath92 .",
    "this quantity changes its sign at @xmath92 , and later we will see that this sign change is mapped onto a property of space coordinate in the classical side .",
    "furthermore , the numerical data suggest only weak @xmath63 dependence on @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "this is somehow different from the standard ads / cft arguments , although the radial axis naturally appears for the construction of the classical geometry . in the standard ads",
    "/ cft , the spacetime coordinates are basically maintained , and we add the radial axis for holographic renormalization . in the present case , however , the theory requires more radical mapping in some sense .",
    "this indicates that the ads / cft is a quite special case of more general gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "it is also meaningful to address the concept of bulk / boundary correspondence .",
    "the readers may think that this concept is not composed of information geometry .",

    "this means that the radial axis characterizes the magnitude of the entanglmenent entropy , and thus the entropy is a key factor of characterizing holographic renormalization .",
    "then , @xmath3 and its conjugate @xmath207 are represented by @xmath203 as @xmath208 and @xmath209 the metric tensor is transformed into @xmath210 we have arrived at the hyperbolic metric with the sectional curvature @xmath180 . therefore , the entanglement entropy or the hessian potential of free fermions is mapped onto the hyperbolic metric exactly . in this sense , the fisher geometry can capture basic properties of the ads / cft correspondences . again",
    "note that we should take euclidean signature for the time coordinate , and this situation is quite similar to the entropy calculation of the black hole . in our case ,",
    "the time evolution originates in the original quantum system and then the imaginary factor naturally appear through the time evolution operator .",
    "this might resolve a long - standing problem for this sign issue .",
    "we finally comment on a physical unit .",
    "we change the notation as @xmath211 , and @xmath212 .",
    "then , @xmath213 can be regarded as the curvature radius @xmath77 of the hyperbolic space . in the ads / cft case ,",
    "the coefficient is actually related to the curvature radius @xmath77 of the ads spacetime which is mapped onto the central charge @xmath197 by the brown - henneaux formula @xmath214 with the newton constant @xmath215  @xcite .",
    "although there is no gravitational constant in our parameter spacetime , the linear relation of @xmath179 to @xmath77 is a strong evidence of the presence of the brown - henneaux - type formula .      to facilitate later discussion",
    ", we would like to introduce an another form of the second derivative of the entropy and compare it with eq .",
    "( [ sd1 ] ) .",
    "we will find the basic properties of @xmath216 previously introduced in eq .",
    "( [ ttt ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that hereafter we should use the canonical parameters @xmath3 instead of @xmath203 . starting with the definition of the entropy in eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) , we find @xmath217 the second derivative of this is given by @xmath218 comparing this with eq .",
    "( [ sd1 ] ) , we find @xmath219 and then @xmath220 this means higher - order metric correction coupled to fluctuation of information embedded into the parameter space .",
    "we will see later that this relation is useful for evaluation of the ricci tensor .",
    "the chistoffel symbol is defined by @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the inverse matrix of the fisher metric .",
    "it is quite easy to notice @xmath223 to find an another form , we differentiate @xmath224 by @xmath225 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath226 and find @xmath227 this tensor plays a central role in the hessian geometry .",
    "the ricci tensor is given by @xmath228 here , we can use the following identity @xmath229 in cases of exponential family , the ricci tensor is transformed into @xmath230 thus , the ricci tensor is basically a bilinear form of the rank - three tensor @xmath231 .    the einstein tensor is represented as @xmath232 where the scalar curvature is defined by @xmath233",
    "based on the results discussed in the previous section , we would like to examine dynamics of the information spacetime .",
    "this examination provides us with information - geometrical interpretation of the einstein equation .",
    "now we are thinking about both of filling dependence and time evolution in the quantum side , and such dynamical change in the quantum side is mapped onto re - distribution of entropy data embedded into the spacetime by the quite non - uniform manner in general .",
    "this situation is quite similar to the presence of the energy - monentum tensor in the standard general relativity .",
    "this is the reason why we consider the einstein equation .",
    "we have already taken the fisher metric as a result of a curved geometry , and thus we are going to evaluate the einstein tensor .",
    "then , we will obtain the energy - momentum tensor as an origin of the fisher metric .",
    "of course the origin should be related to the entanglement entropy .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that the entropy behaves as a scaler field to induce the energy - momentum tensor",
    ". later we will confirm this conjecture .",
    "let us consider the ricci tensor in eq .",
    "( [ riemann2 ] ) . to treat this quantity , we need to obtain a more convenient form of the rank - three tensor @xmath216 . for this purpose",
    ", we differentiate eq .",
    "( [ tt1 ] ) by @xmath225 .",
    "then we find @xmath234 and this leads to @xmath235 here we have the following relation @xmath236 and then eq .  ( [ evaluation ] )",
    "is transformed into @xmath237    here , we introduce two assumptions . at first , we assume the decompostion as @xmath238 this assumption would be reasonable for quantum critical systems .",
    "the spectrum @xmath93 is closely related to correlation function and shows power law decay for the index @xmath1 at criticality .",
    "this means @xmath239 with an exponent @xmath240 , and then the spectrum only behaves as logarithmic increase for @xmath1 .",
    "thus the @xmath1 dependence on the spectrum is not strong .",
    "next we assume @xmath241 with a constant factor @xmath39 .",
    "the second assumptoin is correct if the metric is a power - law - decay function like hyperbolic ( or ads ) metric . for these assumptions ,",
    "we obtain @xmath242      as we have already examined , the fisher metric for the entanglement spectrum for free fermions is hyperbolic ( or ads ) type .",
    "thus , this is clearly a solution of the vacuum einstein equation with negative cosmological constant .",
    "this proceduce is quite opposite to those in the standard general relativity , since in the present case we just substitute the fisher metric into the definition of the einstein tensor . here , we are very much interested in how the entanglement spectrum away from the conformal fixed point behaves in the classical side .",
    "the deformation of the spectrum from those at the critical point induces some dynamics in the information spacetime , and we imagine that the source of the dynamics in the classical side is related to the energy - momentum tensor for a given lagrangian .",
    "we would like to find what is the field strength in the lagrangian .",
    "based on the previous subsection , the ricci tensor is evaluated after some algebrae as @xmath243 and the einstein tensor is represented as @xmath244 we find that the minimal dimension is larger than two to find some nontrivial geometric structure in the information spacetime .",
    "be careful again that this equation is in @xmath3 representation .    here",
    "let us look at free fermion case .",
    "of course , this case exactly satisfies the vacuum einstein equation in definition .",
    "however now we take some approximations to derive eq .",
    "( [ gmn ] ) , and this feature might be violated .",
    "thus , it seems meaningful to confirm reliability of our approximation by looking at whether all the terms in the right hand side in eq .",
    "( [ gmn ] ) are reduced to a negative cosmological constant in the free fermion case .    according to eq .",
    "( [ fullpotential ] ) , the second term in right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gmn ] ) becomes a positive constant : @xmath245 and contributes to a negative cosmological constant for @xmath246 . on the other hand , the first term of eq .",
    "( [ gmn ] ) for @xmath247 is evaluated as follows : @xmath248 for @xmath249 , we also find @xmath250 this does not show perfect match with @xmath251 , but this is not bad at least for @xmath252 .",
    "thus , the first term of eq .",
    "( [ gmn ] ) seems to absorbed into the cosmological constant .",
    "the constant is defined by @xmath253 note that this @xmath17 dependence is familiar in curved geometry , and thus we think that our approximation gives reasonable results when we go away from critical point .",
    "away from critical point , this feature would be deformed , but we approximately treat the second term as the constant .",
    "we introduce the difference of the entanglement entropy from its critical value @xmath254 as @xmath255 . then , eq .  ( [ gmn ] )",
    "is reduced to the following form @xmath256    by the above analysis , we notice that @xmath257 behaves as a free scaler field in this classical spacetime .",
    "thus , let us define the effective lagrangian for the scaler field @xmath257 as @xmath258 and then the energy - momentum tensor can be represented as @xmath259 and then eq .",
    "( [ einstein1 ] ) is equal to the einstein equation @xmath260 where @xmath261 this is what we would like to obtain here .",
    "there is a comment about approximation to derive eq .",
    "( [ tapprox ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ tbefore ] ) .",
    "this leads to the presence of the free scaler field , and more precise treatment might induce some interaction for the field or more complicated fields .",
    "this would be a future work .",
    "we have examined geometric structure of information spacetime spanned by the fisher metric for the exponential family class of probability distribution .",
    "this class matches with the entanglement spectrum for 1d free fermion system that is a typical cft , and we can naturally examine the embedding of quantum critical data into classical manifold .",
    "this situation is quite similar to the physics of ads / cft .",
    "we have found that eqs .",
    "( [ rep1 ] ) and ( [ solve ] ) are crucial to understand a close relationship among the entanglement entropy , the hessian potential , and the classical metric . actually , this relationship leads to the correspondence between ads and cft .",
    "we have also found that the fisher metric for free fermions at the critical point is the vacuum solution of the einstein equation and the deformation of the entanglement spectrum or the entanglement entropy from the critical point produces the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "there , the classical scaler field is equal to the entanglement entropy embedded into the spacetime , and the field fluctuation from the uniform hyperbolic background is essential for the emergence of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "therefore , the einstein equation describing the dynamics of the information spacetime corresponds to a kind of the equation of states in the quantum side .",
    "this interpretation seems to be consistent with the entanglement thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "we summarize important quantities in the present theory in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the most important finding is the presence of _ internal structure _ of the ads / cft correspondence . to find the correspondence , once we must go to canonical parameter space , and construct a hessian potential .",
    "interestingly , this internal structure is a kind of fourier space for a pseudo - fermon system .",
    "the functional form of the hessian potential is determined so that the fisher metric becomes ads . in this case",
    ", we need to perform general coordinate transformation defined by eq .",
    "( [ yy ] ) .",
    "we pull such potential back into the original representation by @xmath64 .",
    "since the hessian potential can be identified with the entanglement entropy , we compare the potential represented by @xmath64 with various scaling formulae of the entanglement entropy .",
    "then , we find whether there exists a certain correspondence between ads and cft .",
    "our analysis provides a positive answer to this problem .",
    "although several procedures are somehow complicated , we can also find a bulk / boundary correspondence in a sense that the original quantum system lives in the boundary of the ads spacetime : if we go to @xmath262 in the original representation of the quantum side , then we approach the boundary @xmath263 of the poincare disk in the classical ads spacetime . in usual information geometry , the concept of the bulk / boundary correspondence",
    "is not included , but the present analysis suggests the presence of such correspondence .",
    "we believe that our approach is essentially equal to the standard notion of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "finally , we note that a recent paper on transformation of non - commutative geometry into classical geometry seems to use a method similar to the fisher metric  @xcite .",
    "this similarity is also an evidence of powerfulness of information - geometrical approaches when we are going to smear out quantum mechanically fluctuating data to construct a classical spacetime .",
