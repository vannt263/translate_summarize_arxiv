    "in recent years , multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) broadcast channel ( bc ) systems , constructed by an access point with multiple antennas and many users , have been intensively studied @xcite . in a mimo bc ,",
    "multiple users are simultaneously served through independent user specific multiple data streams and a _ multiplexing gain _ is attained as in point - to - point mimo .",
    "the capacity region of the gaussian mimo bc was derived in @xcite where dirty paper coding ( dpc ) @xcite is known to be a capacity achieving scheme . because dpc is hard to implement ,",
    "many practical techniques have been proposed such as zero - forcing precoding ( channel inversion ) @xcite and tomlinson - harashima precoding @xcite . in these schemes ,",
    "multiuser interference is pre - canceled at the transmitter with perfect channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) .",
    "csit can be obtained by reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels in time division duplexing ( tdd ) systems and feedback from receivers in frequency division duplexing ( fdd ) systems . in fdd systems , the amount of feedback information is in general limited and hence perfect csit is not available .",
    "the accuracy of csit depends on both the type of feedback technique and the amount of feedback overhead allowed .",
    "a popular feedback architecture is a codebook approach where an index of a codeword in a predetermined codebook is fed back to the transmitter @xcite .",
    "there have been many studies on the performance of codebook based multi - user mimo systems using various transmission schemes such as zero - forcing ( zf ) beamforming @xcite , block diagonalization ( bd ) @xcite , and the unitary precoding @xcite .    in limited feedback environments ,",
    "a key difference between mimo bc and point - to - point mimo is the multiplexing gain achievability @xcite . in point - to - point mimo ,",
    "a full multiplexing gain is achievable even with open - loop transmission . on the other hand",
    ", a full multiplexing gain can not be achieved using a finite amount of feedback information in a mimo bc @xcite .",
    "the multiplexing gain of mimo bc rather diminishes in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) region due to imperfect orthogonalization resulting from inaccurate csit . to maintain the multiplexing gain ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the feedback size should linearly increase with snr ( in decibel scale ) .    since",
    "a large amount of feedback is a heavy burden on uplink capacity , many studies have been devoted to increasing the efficiency of limited feedback . in @xcite ,",
    "a feedback reduction technique has been proposed using multiple antennas at the receiver .",
    "user selection in mimo bc has been studied to reduce the amount of uplink feedback @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "random beamforming was generalized and semi - orthogonal user selection was proposed .",
    "also , it was shown that channel quality information as well as channel direction information are necessary to obtain both the maximum multiplexing and diversity gains . in @xcite ,",
    "a dual - mode limited feedback system was proposed to switch between single user and multiuser transmissions .",
    "the authors in @xcite investigated two partial feedback schemes for user scheduling .",
    "in practical systems , the uplink capacity of control channels is typically limited and shared among multiple users . a sum feedback rate constraint in space division multiple access ( sdma )",
    "was considered in @xcite but the amount of feedback information per user was held constant . in @xcite ,",
    "the optimum feedback size per user and the number of feedback users were investigated under a sum feedback rate constraint assuming all users employ the same amount of feedback .",
    "recently , strategies of feedback bit partitioning between the desired and interfering channels proposed in @xcite for a cooperative multicell system . in @xmath0-user multiple - input - single - output",
    "( miso ) interference channel , the feedback rate control to minimize the average interference power was proposed in @xcite .    in mimo bc ,",
    "the effects of different amounts of feedback size among the users are studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the feedback rate sharing strategy has been proposed to minimize the upper bound of sum rate loss in correlated single - polarized and dual - polarized channels , respectively .",
    "the feedback rate sharing strategies in the low and high snr regions have been proposed in terms of the correlation coefficient .",
    "the feedback rate sharing strategy to increase the sum rate was also proposed in @xcite by considering users path losses , where the system performance was shown to be improved by changing feedback bit allocation according to the path losses",
    ". however , when the path losses are similar , the feedback rate sharing strategy in @xcite is to equally share the sum feedback size regardless of snr levels but it is not optimal in some snr regions . also , the effects of path losses are canceled out in the high snr region so that equal sharing of the sum feedback size is not optimal any more . the feedback rate sharing strategy to minimize total transmission power for given users outage probabilities",
    "was proposed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a new analytical framework for the feedback rate sharing strategy and rigorously analyzed the effects of different amounts of feedback information among users by extending and generalizing the results of @xcite .",
    "the effects of feedback rate sharing on the achievable rate are investigated in a mimo bc with zf beamforming at the transmitter and random vector quantization ( rvq ) @xcite at each user .",
    "we derive the optimal feedback rate sharing strategies according to various snr regions .",
    "our analytical results prove the optimal feedback rate sharing strategy in the low and the high snr regions .",
    "the feedback rate should be equally shared among all users in the low snr region while the whole feedback rate should be allocated to a single user in the high snr region . for the mid - snr region ,",
    "we establish a simple numerical method for finding the optimal feedback sharing strategy based on our analytical framework . through the proposed numerical method",
    ", we find that to equally allocate whole feedback size to a partial number of users is the optimal feedback rate sharing strategy . for the users suffering different path losses ,",
    "we show that the proposed numerical method can be applicable to finding the optimal feedback rate sharing strategy . in the high snr region , we prove that the effects of path losses are canceled out and hence the optimal feedback strategy is to allocate the whole feedback size to a single user with the highest snr . our proposed feedback rate sharing strategy derived from the system with zf beamforming and rvq",
    "is also evaluated for the systems with other techniques such as stream control , regularized zf transmission scheme and spherical cap codebook model @xcite .",
    "our numerical results show that our proposed feedback rate sharing strategy is still valid for other configurations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the system model and formulate the problem in section ii .",
    "the impacts of asymmetric feedback size among users are investigated in section iii .",
    "the optimal sum feedback rate sharing strategy is derived in section iv .",
    "the numerical results are shown in section v. section vi concludes our paper .",
    "our system model is depicted in fig .",
    "we consider a mimo bc with @xmath1 transmit antennas and @xmath2 users having a single antenna .",
    "if the receiver has multiple antennas , each antenna can be considered as an independent user , or receive combining discussed in @xcite can be adopted .",
    "the received signal at the user @xmath3 becomes @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the path loss of the @xmath3th user , @xmath6 is a channel vector whose entries are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance , @xmath7 is the transmit signal vector , @xmath8 is a complex gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance , and the superscript @xmath9 denotes conjugate transposition of a vector . when @xmath10 is the transmit signal power , @xmath11 satisfies that @xmath12=p$ ] . if users demand the same quality of service , the propagation path losses need to be pre - compensated to yield the same average snr at the receiver in downlink .",
    "thus , we firstly assume that the different propagation path losses for users are compensated by the transmitter , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "the open loop power control is also useful for preventing waste of transmit power and avoiding extra interference to other users .",
    "then , we extend our results to different path loss scenarios in section [ sec : different_paths ] .    as a simple linear precoding scheme ,",
    "we adopt a zf beamforming scheme in which the data stream for each user is aligned with its precoding vector .",
    "we denote the precoding vector of the @xmath3th user as @xmath14 such that @xmath15 and then the transmit signal @xmath11 becomes @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the data symbol for the @xmath3th user .",
    "we assume that the transmitter has only channel direction information ( cdi ) so that the feedback for power allocation can be saved .",
    "therefore , the transmitter allocates equal power to users such that @xmath18 .",
    "also , we assume that @xmath17 is chosen from a gaussian codebook and the codeword block length is sufficiently long so that it encounters all possible channel realizations for ergodicity . obviously , power adaptation can further increase the achievable rate but the power allocation using channel quality information ( cqi ) is a secondary problem when the number of transmit antennas is same as the number of served users , i.e. , full multiplexing @xcite . in section [ section : stream_control ]",
    ", we will consider the stream control where the transmitter adaptively controls multiplexing gain and the served users equally share total transmit power .    the received signal at the @xmath3th user using linear precoding becomes @xmath19 when the transmitter knows @xmath20 perfectly , the precoding vectors yield zero multiuser interferences , i.e. , @xmath21 ; the received signal at the @xmath3th user becomes @xmath22 in most practical systems , however , the imperfect csi is only available at the transmitter due to the limited feedback budget .",
    "the user @xmath3 quantizes its own channel , @xmath23 , and feeds the quantized csi denoted by @xmath24 to the transmitter .",
    "then , the transmitter finds the precoding vectors @xmath25 from the quantized csi , @xmath26 , instead of the perfect csi , @xmath27 .",
    "because of the quantization errors , the precoding vectors obtained from the quantized csi can not perfectly mitigate the multiuser interference .",
    "the precoding vector can not be exactly picked in the null space of the other users channel vectors ; the interference term @xmath28 remains in the received signal .    at the transmitter , a quantized channel matrix defined by @xmath29 ^\\dagger$ ]",
    "is constructed with the quantized csi fed back from the users .",
    "the @xmath3th normalized column vector of @xmath30 becomes the precoding vector for the @xmath3th user , @xmath14 , where @xmath31 denotes the matrix inversion .",
    "thus , we can decompose @xmath30 as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 $ ] is a zero - forcing beamforming matrix such as @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is diagonal matrix whose element @xmath36 is the euclidean norm of the @xmath3th column of @xmath30 .    for the channel quantization",
    ", rvq is considered at each user , which is widely used to analyze the effects of quantization error and asymptotically optimal as the number of antennas goes to infinity @xcite .",
    "although the performance is suboptimal for a small feedback size , rvq makes the analysis tractable and provides insightful results .",
    "furthermore , the overall trends of rvq generally agree with the trends of other quantization models @xcite .    using @xmath37-bit rvq at the @xmath3th user ,",
    "the quantized csi is obtained by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a random vector codebook at the @xmath3th user consists of @xmath40 randomly chosen isotropic @xmath1-dimensional unit vectors .",
    "the quantization error denoted by @xmath41 $ ] becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "for an arbitrary codeword @xmath44 , @xmath45 is a squared inner product of two independent random vectors isotropic in @xmath46 , so follows the beta distribution with parameters ( @xmath47 ) becomes @xmath48 @xcite . ] with parameters @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "consequently , a quantization error using @xmath37-bit rvq , @xmath50 , becomes the minimum of @xmath40 independent beta distributed random variables with parameters @xmath49 .",
    "correspondingly the complementary cumulative density function ( cdf ) of @xmath50 is given by @xcite @xmath51}=\\left(1-z^{m-1}\\right)^{2^{b_k}}.      \\label{eqn : qe_cdf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we assume an _ average _ feedback size allocated for each user is @xmath52 so that the total feedback rate ( i.e. , the sum of all individual users feedback rates ) becomes @xmath53 bits per channel realization .",
    "assuming the feedback rate sharing among users , each user uses @xmath37-bit feedback and the sum feedback rate constraint becomes @xmath54 . since codebook size is typically a non - negative integer number of bits , we restrict the average feedback size , @xmath52 , as an positive integer , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "for the same reason , we assume the feedback size at the @xmath3th user , @xmath37 , as a non - negative integer , i.e. , @xmath56 for @xmath57 ,    from individual feedback rates , a feedback rate sharing strategy can be expressed by @xmath0-dimensional vector @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the sum feedback rate constraint becomes @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the vector one norm .    from",
    ", we obtain the average sum rate as a function of transmit power , @xmath10 , and the sum feedback rate sharing strategy , @xmath61 , denoted by @xmath62 given by @xmath63 .",

    "several allocation patterns can be constructed offline for typical snr values and then the transmitter can broadcast an appropriate allocation pattern using the current snr .",
    "to find the optimal feedback rate sharing strategy , we first analyze the impact of asymmetric feedback sizes among the users on the sum rate . for the simplicity ,",
    "we define three random variables @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the @xmath3th channel gain , @xmath67 is the squared inner product between the @xmath3th normalized channel vector and the @xmath3th beamforming vector , and @xmath68 is the sum of the squared inner products between the @xmath3th normalized channel vector and the other beamforming vectors . note that @xmath67 is not affected by the feedback size of the @xmath3th user since @xmath14 is selected in the null space of @xmath69 .    using the quantization error",

    "the random variable @xmath68 becomes @xmath74 where the random variable @xmath75 is the sum of the square of inner products between the quantization error vector @xmath72 and the beamforming vectors of other users @xmath76 .",
    "the independency between @xmath50 and @xmath77 is shown in [ 12 ] from the fact that the magnitude of the quantization error , @xmath50 is independent of the direction of quantization error , @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we can easily find that @xmath50 and @xmath78 are independent .",
    "we start from the following lemma .",
    "[ lemma : rv_properties ] the random variables @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath79 and @xmath50 have following properties .",

    ", the transmitter can pick the beamforming vectors of other users in more accurate null space of the user @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the user @xmath3 benefits from less interference from other users . on the other hand , the other users experience more interference since the accuracy of the users channel knowledge degrades under the sum feedback rate constraint .",
