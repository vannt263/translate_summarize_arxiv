    "the effective potential constitutes a fundamental tool in quantum field theory , widely used to study a multitude of physical phenomena , such as spontaneous symmetry breaking , tunnelling rates due to vacuum instability , and thermal phase transitions . with the ever increasing experimental precision on the determination of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson mass at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    ", more accurate computations of the sm effective potential can now be performed up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "assuming  no  new physics and ignoring quantum - gravity effects , such nnlo studies  @xcite imply that the sm vacuum may well be metastable .",
    "most remarkably , the actual profile of the effective potential at large higgs - field values was found to be extremely sensitive to very small variations of the input parameters at the electroweak scale  @xcite , thereby rendering such precision computations rather subtle .",
    "interestingly enough , this unusual feature seems to have sparked in the last years renewed interest in studying several field - theoretical aspects of the effective potential , which include the development of new semi - analytical techniques beyond ordinary perturbation theory  @xcite , the treatment of infrared ( ir ) divergences due to the masslessness of the sm would - be goldstone bosons  @xcite , more precise field - theoretical approaches to estimating tunnelling rates  @xcite and assessing their gauge dependence  @xcite , as well as evaluations of sm metastability rates in the presence of planck - scale suppressed operators  @xcite .",
    "the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action , as introduced by cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis  @xcite , provides a powerful approach to resumming infinite series of higher - order diagrams of a given loop - graph topology in a systematic and self - consistent way . nevertheless , simple restrictions of the 2pi effective action to considering only a finite number of loop - graph topologies usually cause residual violations of possible underlying symmetries of the theory , which in turn introduce inconsistencies to the equations of motion .",
    "most notably , for theories realizing spontaneous breakdown of global symmetries , naive truncations of the 2pi effective action lead to massive goldstone bosons ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . a potentially interesting theoretical framework for addressing this problem is the so - called symmetry improved two - particle - irreducible  ( si2pi ) formalism  @xcite , in which symmetry - consistent restrictions to the 2pi truncated equations of motion were implemented .",
    "the resulting si2pi effective action has a number of satisfactory field - theoretical properties  @xcite , including the masslessness of the goldstone bosons and the proper prediction of a second order thermal phase transition for @xmath2 scalar theories .",
    "further applications and developments of the sip2pi formalism may be found in @xcite . in particular , in @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , the effect of fermions has been included in a semi - perturbative way and the si2pi effective potential has been used to address from _ first principles _ the ir divergence problem of the perturbative sm effective potential due to the masslessness of the would - be goldstone bosons .",
    "hence , the results of this si2pi approach have proved to be very useful , as they enable one to assess the regime of validity of other simplified and partially _ ad hoc _",
    "approaches  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the renormalization - group ( rg ) properties of the si2pi formalism , and prove for the first time a number of remarkable field - theoretical results .",
    "first , after briefly reviewing the formalism in sec .  [",
    "sec : si2pi ] , we show in sec .  [",
    "sec : finite ] that the runnings of all proper 2pi quartic couplings are ultra - violet ( uv ) finite , without ignoring higher - order terms , in the hartree  fock and sunset approximations of the 2pi effective action .",
    "in fact , as this result is highly non - trivial , one may even conjecture that the uv finiteness of all proper 2pi quartic couplings will hold true to any arbitrarily high loop order of truncation of the si2pi effective action .",
    "an equally important result of our study is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg_inv ] , where we show how the si2pi effective potential is _ exactly _ rg invariant at a given loop order of truncation , in stark contrast to what happens in the usual 1pi formalism , where the perturbative effective potential is rg invariant only _ up to higher order terms_. this is a remarkable result , as it helps us to clarify the relation between the 2pi resummation and the frequently considered rg - improved approach to the 1pi effective potential .",
    "specifically , the former takes into account precisely the higher - order contributions needed to restore exact rg invariance when the effective potential is evaluated at a given loop level , whereas the latter attempts to minimize these higher - order terms by plausibly guessing the value of the rg scale  @xmath3 , so as to avoid large logarithmic contributions . at this point , it is important to clarify that the approach we follow here differs conceptually from the one presented in  @xcite , where functional methods were employed to reinforce rg invariance in the 2pi effective action .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : rgsi2pi ] we modify the si2pi formalism by appropriately improving the rg running of the quartic couplings .",
    "this enables us to reach a high level of accuracy , and compare our results with the 1pi nnlo potential , which includes two - loop threshold corrections matched with 3-loop rg running .",
    "we show that , as a consequence of the exact rg - invariance shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg_inv ] , the predictions for the profile of the effective potential in the si2pi framework can reach a higher level of accuracy , even up to one order of magnitude , than the corresponding one obtained in the 1pi formalism .",
    "this is indeed a significantly new result obtained for a simple @xmath0 theory that certainly encourages further studies within the context of more realistic theories . in a similar vein , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we draw our conclusions and present possible future directions to this field .",
