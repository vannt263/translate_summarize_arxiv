    "d7-branes and their bound states with lower dimensional d - branes play a central role in modern string phenomenology , including moduli stabilization @xcite , gut model building @xcite , and models of inflation such as @xcite .",
    "the vacuum degeneracy arising from the d - brane sector moreover vastly dominates that arising from the bulk @xcite . getting",
    "a systematic understanding of this sector in a compact setting is an important but difficult task .",
    "explicit enumeration of vacua is computationally intractable . in @xcite ,",
    "inspired by @xcite , a program was proposed to analyze large classes of string vacua simultaneously by statistical methods .",
    "basic formulae were developed in @xcite to estimate numbers of vacua in specified regions of parameter space , without explicit enumeration .",
    "these formulae are approximate , becoming accurate in certain large d - brane charge limits .",
    "tadpole cancelation constraints fix these charges to specific values in actual compactifications , typically in a `` mesoscopic '' range , where the counting formulae are never deep in their asymptotic region of validity .",
    "in fact , in the specific problem of counting d7 worldvolume vacua , one generically ends up in a regime where the formulae developed so far are at best poor approximations @xcite .",
    "one is therefore led to ask if this situation can be improved .",
    "one idea is the following . in the weak string coupling limit , i.e.  classically",
    ", the internal configuration spaces of space - filling and spatially localized wrapped d - brane systems are identical .",
    "their interpretation is very different though : the former represent vacua , the latter give rise to microstates of particle - like objects , which become black holes at sufficiently large values of the string coupling .",
    "because of this , the problem of counting supersymmetric vacua and counting supersymmetric black hole microstates are in essence mathematically identical , if we take `` counting '' to mean computing the appropriate witten index , which can be computed at arbitrarily weak coupling .",
    "it is essentially the euler characteristic of the d - brane configuration moduli space .",
    "this is in many ways a sensible definition of the notion of counting vacua , as advocated in @xcite and further discussed below in section [ sec : countingd7 ] .",
    "thus , in principle , we could effectively count vacua in the lab , by producing a mesoscopic bps black hole with the appropriate charges , and subsequently measuring its entropy !",
    "of course we do nt quite live in the right universe to actually do this experiment , but we can perform it at a theoretical level : we can construct the appropriate black hole solutions and compute their entropy by applying the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula or a refinement thereof .",
    "this is in general a relatively simple task , much simpler in any case than microscopically deriving the numbers .",
    "rather than derive estimates ourselves , we let gravity do the work for us !    in actuality , the mapping is a little more complicated , and also a little more interesting .",
    "physically , what maps space - filling and point - localized d - branes to each other is t - duality .",
    "start with a type iib calabi - yau orientifold compactification of o3/o7 type , containing space - filling d7- and d3-branes , at vanishingly small string coupling .",
    "now imagine we compactify space itself ( the `` visible '' space in which we live ) on a 3-torus , and t - dualize along the three spatial directions , to a type iia theory .",
    "this maps space filling d7- and d3-branes to space localized d4- and d0-branes .",
    "in addition , the orientifold planes become localized too , the original orientifold involution getting extended by the spatial inversion @xmath3 , which has eight fixed points on the 3-torus .",
    "the total charge of the resulting configuration will be zero , as required by tadpole cancelation on the iib side and by the compactness of space .",
    "we may decompactify space again to @xmath4 , with an orientifold plane at the origin . in this noncompact",
    "setting , the total charge need not be zero , and we can consider arbitrary sets of rr charged particles obtained by wrapping d - branes on internal cycles , as long as they respect the orientifold symmetry , including spatial inversion .    when we increase the gravitational coupling sufficiently , these configurations will turn into black hole systems .",
    "the most general stationary bps solutions will be multicentered black hole bound states similar to those in the parent ( unorientifolded ) @xmath5 theory @xcite , but now subject to the orientifold projection constraints .",
    "we call these orientifolded black holes _ orientiholes_. as we will see , various physical properties of orientiholes find direct microscopical interpretations . here",
    "are a few examples . a particular @xmath6 torsion charge which can be measured concretely by an aharanov - bohm type experiment corresponds to a delicate uncanceled `` k - theory tadpole '' on the iib side , which manifests itself as a subtle gauge anomaly in certain probe gauge theories .",
    "the intrinsic field angular momentum generated by a pair of orientiholes corresponds to an index counting open strings stretched between the corresponding branes , properly taking into account the orientifold projection .",
    "stability of orientihole bound states maps to d - term stability of orientifold vacua . for systems",
    "whose constituents are simple particles rather than black holes , an exact map between witten indices of multiparticle abd d - brane moduli space quantum mechanics can be established , generalizing results of @xcite .",
    "although we arrived at them because of their relation to iib orientifold vacua , orientiholes are quite interesting in their own right , independent of any applications to vacuum statistics .",
    "in particular they lead to nontrivial generalizations of recently proposed wall crossing formulae for bps indices .",
    "most notably perhaps , we conjecture a relation to the topological string similar to the `` @xmath7 '' relation conjectured by ooguri , strominger and vafa in @xcite , except that now the relation is _ linear _ ; schematically : @xmath8 . morally speaking this is because orientifolding cuts out real slices and identifies complex conjugates .",
    "in section 2 we derive the correct o4/o0 and o6/o2 iia orientihole projection conditions by spatially t - dualizing the standard iib o7/o3 resp .",
    "o9/o5 orientifold transformations . in section 3",
    "we derive the general form of orientihole solutions and investigate their properties . in section 4",
    "we define an orientihole index , derive a wall crossing formula and formulate a conjectural relation to the topological string . in section 5",
    "we give some applications to counting d7 vacua .",
    "finally in section 6 we discuss directions for future research .",
    "in the following we describe how spatial t - duality maps iib orientifold compactifications with space - filling d - branes and o - planes to iia compactifications with spatially _ localized _ d - branes and o - planes . since string compactifications with o - planes localized in points of the visible universe are not commonly considered , we detail the constraints on the massless bosonic fields such a setup entails . in this section",
    "we will work in the weak coupling limit @xmath9 . in the next section",
    "we will describe the corresponding supergravity solutions which arise when @xmath10 is increased ",
    "these are the orientiholes .      consider type iib string theory compactified on a calabi - yau three - fold @xmath11 characterized by a unique holomorphic three - form @xmath12 and a khler form @xmath13 .",
    "we are interested in a @xmath14 orientifold and therefore we assume that the calabi - yau @xmath11 admits a holomorphic involutive isometry @xmath15 preserving the holomorphic three - form up to a sign @xcite : @xmath16 from the action of @xmath17 on @xmath12 we see that when @xmath18 , an odd number of holomorphic coordinates gets inverted , while when @xmath18 , an even number gets inverted , thus giving rise to the following types of o - planes : @xmath19 we denote by @xmath20 the worldsheet parity operator which takes left - moving oscillators to right - moving oscillators and vice versa . will also be used to represent the symplectic section of special geometry , and the index of bps states .",
    "we really like this letter a lot . ] the space - time fermion number in the left - moving sector will be denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "the total orientifold action @xmath22 is then @xcite : @xmath23 the inclusion of @xmath24 when @xmath18 ensures that the orientifold symmetry is involutive on space - time fermions , i.e.  @xmath25 .",
    "our ten dimensional space - time is @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 the spatial coordinates of @xmath28 .",
    "we first compactify the three spatial coordinates @xmath29 on a 3-torus .",
    "next we t - dualize along all three directions , and decompactify the resulting dual 3-torus again , thus ending up in type iia on @xmath30 .",
    "the t - duality action @xmath31 along the three directions of @xmath29 transforms the orientifold transformations as @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a reflection in all the three spatial directions @xmath34 ( now of the t - dual space ) : @xmath35 a type iib space - time filling o@xmath36-plane wrapping a holomorphic submanifold @xmath37 of the calabi - yau @xmath11 becomes in type iia a transverse o@xmath38-plane located at the fixed loci of the involution @xmath39 .",
    "that is , it wraps the holomorphic - submanifold @xmath37 of the calabi - yau three - fold @xmath11 and is located at the origin @xmath40 of the universe . the total orientifold action is now given by @xmath41 where for @xmath18 we get an @xmath42 at the origin and for @xmath43 an @xmath44 .",
    "the massless fields in the effective @xmath45 , @xmath46 supergravity will be constrained by the orientifold projection .",
