    "when a gas of massive bosons are cooled to a temperature very close to absolute zero in an external potential , a large fraction of the atoms collapse into the lowest quantum state of the external potential forming a condensate known as a bose einstein condensate ( bec ) [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "bose einstein condensation is an exotic quantum phenomenon observed in dilute atomic gases and has made a huge turnaround in the fields of atom optics and condensed matter physics .",
    "the recent experimental realization of becs in rubidium [ 5 ] has really kickstarted the upsurge in this area of research leading to flurry of activities in this direction while the observation of dark [ 6 ] and bright solitons [ 7 ] , periodic waves [ 8 ] , vortices and necklaces [ 9 ] has given an impetus to the investigation of this singular state of matter .",
    "the dynamics of becs is in general governed by an inhomogeneous nonlinear schrodinger ( nls ) equation called the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation and the behaviour of the condensates depends on the scattering length ( binary interatomic interaction ) and the trapping potential .",
    "eventhough the gp equation is in general nonintegrable , it has been recently investigated for specific choices of scattering lengths and trapping potentials [ 10 - 12 ] .",
    "it is known that a bec comprises of coherent matter waves analogous to coherent laser pulses and the wave nature of each atom is precisely in phase with that of every other atom . in other words ,",
    "the atoms occupy the same volume of space , move at identical speeds ; scatter light of the same color and so on .",
    "hence , it looked fundamentally impossible to distinguish them by any measurement .",
    "this quantum degeneracy arising out of high degree of coherence has been recently exploited in an experiment by andrews et al . and ketterle s group [ 13 ] showing that when two seperate coluds of becs overlap under free ballistic expansion , the result is a fringe pattern of alternating constructive and destructive interference just as it occurs with two interesting laser radiations . in other words , when becs were made to collide upon release from the trap , de broglie wave interference pattern containing stripes of high and low density were clearly observed .",
    "these experiments which underlined the high degree of spatial coherence of becs led to the creation of atom laser [ 14 ] .",
    "can one observe the same matter wave interference pattern by allowing the bright solitons which are condensates themselves to collide in a trap ?",
    "motivated by this consideration , we investigate the collisional dynamics of condensates in a time dependent trapping potential .",
    "at the mean field level , the time evolution of macroscopic wavefunction of becs is governed by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 represent atoms in a cylindrical trap and time dependent trap along z - direction respectively .",
    "the time dependent trap could be either confining or expulsive while the time dependent atomic scattering length @xmath7 can be either attractive ( @xmath8)or repulsive ( @xmath9 ) . as a result ,",
    "the condensates confront with both time dependent scattering length and time dependent trapping potential .",
    "considering becs as an assembly of weakly interacting atomic gases , eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be effectively reduced to a one dimensional gp equation taking the following form ( in dimensionless units ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the bohr radius , m(t ) describes time dependent harmonic trap which can be either attractive ( @xmath13 ) or expulsive ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "now , to generate bright solitons of eq .",
    "( 2 ) for both regular and expulsive potentials , we introduce the following modified lens transformation @xmath15 where the phase has the following simple quadratic form @xmath16    substituting the modified lens transformation given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) in eq . ( 2 ) , we obtain the modified nls equation @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19    equation ( 5 ) admits the following linear eigen value problem @xmath20    in the above linear eigenvalue problem , the spectral parameter which is complex is nonisospectral obeying the following equation @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "it is obvious that the compatability condition @xmath23 generates eq .",
    "( 5 ) .    substituting eq . ( 7 ) with @xmath22 in eq . ( 6 ) , we get @xmath24    thus , the solvability of the gp eqn.(2 ) depends on the suitable choices of scattering length @xmath25 and the trap frequency m(t ) consitent with eq .",
    "recently eq . ( 2 ) has been investigated and bright solitons have been generated employing gauge transformation approach [ 11 ] .",
    "to investigate the collisional dynamics of condensates in the presence of a time dependent trap , we now consider the two bright soliton of the following form , @xmath26 where @xmath27\\nonumber\\\\   & - & 4i\\beta_1 \\beta_2 ( \\alpha_2   - \\alpha_1 ) \\ } e^{(\\theta_1   + i\\xi_2 ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath28e^ { ( - \\theta_1   + i\\xi_2 ) } \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath29 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & 4i\\beta_1 \\beta_2 ( \\alpha_2   - \\alpha_1 ) \\ } e^{(i\\xi_1   + \\theta_2 ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30e^{(i\\xi_1   - \\theta_2 ) } \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath31\\nonumber\\\\ b_2&= & 2\\;\\cosh ( \\theta _ 1 ) \\;\\cosh ( \\theta _ 2 ) \\;[(\\alpha _ 2 - \\alpha _ 1 ) ^2   + ( \\beta _ 1 ^ 2   + \\beta _ 2 ^ 2 ) ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath32 @xmath33    to generate the interference pattern , we now allow the bright solitons to collide with each other in the presence of trap for suitable choices of scattering length @xmath25 and trap frequency m(t ) ( or c(t ) ) consistent with eq .",
    "( 11 ) .    case ( i ) : when c(t)=@xmath34tan@xmath35 , the variation of scattering length @xmath25=0.2sec@xmath35 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "accordingly , the trap frequency m(t ) becomes a constant ( m(t)=2 ) . under this condition , the collisional dynamics of bright solitons in the harmonic trap",
    "is shown in fig.2a and the corresponding density evolution in fig .",
    "the density evolution consists of alternating bright and dark fringes of high and low density respectively while the phase difference between the condensates shown in fig .",
    "3 continuously changes with time .",
    "case(ii ) : when c(t)=@xmath34cot@xmath35 , the scattering length varies sinusoidally with time as in the case of feshbach resonance ( shown in fig.4 ) while the trap becomes m(t)=@xmath36 .",
    "the evolution of the condensates in the above time dependent trap and the corresponding density evolution are now shown in figs 5a and 5b . from the interference pattern",
    ", one observes that the matter wave density is maximum at the origin and it decreases gradually on either sides .",
    "again , the phase change between the condensates oscillates with time as shown in fig.6 .",
    "thus , our results reinforce the fact that the matter waves originating from the condensates ( bright solitons ) do interfere and produce a fringe pattern analogous to the coherent laser beams and the interference pattern is a clear signature of the long range spatial coherence of the condensates .",
    "it should be mentioned that the interference patterns were obtained earlier by andrews et al . [ 13 ] under the condition of free ballistic expansion ( atoms are released from the trap ) while we selectively tune the frequency of the trap m(t ) in accordance with the scattering length @xmath25 ( consistent with eq.(11 ) ) to observe matter wave interference in the collisional dynamics of bright solitons .",
    "it should be mentioned that the optical traps have opened up the possibility of realizing different types of temporal variation of the trap frequency m(t ) while the scattering length @xmath25 can be controlled both by feshbach resonance as well as through the trap frequency m(t ) . the phase change evolution which gives a measure of",
    "the coherence of the condensates shown in figs.3 and 6 shows that it oscillates with time and this is reminiscent of josephsen effect wherein the phase difference between the superconducting wave functions oscillates with time .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that it is possible to observe matter wave interference pattern by studying the collisional dynamics of condensates ( bright solitons ) for suitable choices of scattering length @xmath25 and trap frequency m(t ) and this could happen without free ballistic expansion .",
    "we also observe that the phase difference between the condensates oscillates with time clearly showing the manifestation of josephson effect",
    ". it would be interesting to interpret the matter wave destructive interference and whether this would mean that atoms plus atoms add up to vaccuum .",
