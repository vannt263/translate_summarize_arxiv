    "there is growing evidence for the existence of so - called magnetars , supermagnetized neutron stars with the magnetic fields of @xmath0 g ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although such stars are estimated to be only a subclass ( @xmath1 ) of the canonical neutron stars with @xmath2 g  @xcite , much attention has been paid to the objects because they pose many astrophysically exciting but unresolved problems .",
    "giant flaring activities in the soft gamma repeaters observed for the last two decades have given us good opportunities to study the coupling of the interior to the magnetospheric structures of magnetars @xcite , but the relationship between the crustal fraction and the subsequent star quarks has not yet been clarified ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the large magnetic field is also a big problem , whether generated at post - collapse in the rapidly rotating neutron star @xcite or descended from the main sequence stars @xcite . assuming large magnetic fields before core - collapse , researches have recently performed extensive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) stellar collapse simulations  @xcite in order to understand the formation mechanism of magnetars , with different levels of sophistication in the treatment of equations of state ( eoss ) , the neutrino transport , and general relativity ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "here it is worth mentioning that the gravitational waves from magnetars could be a useful source of information about magnetar interiors  @xcite . from a microscopic point of view , the effects of magnetic field larger than the so - called qed limit of @xmath3 , on the eoss ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the radiation processes have been also extensively investigated ( see @xcite for a review ) . for the understanding of the formation and evolution of the magnetars ,",
    "it is indispensable to unify these macroscopic and microscopic studies , albeit not an easy job .",
    "when one tries to study the above interesting issues , the construction of an equilibrium configuration of magnetars may be one of the most fundamental problems . in spite of the many magnetized star investigations that have so far been carried out , with different levels of sophistication in the treatment of the magnetic field structure , equations of state ( eoss ) , and the general relativity  @xcite ,",
    "there still remains room for more sophistication in the previous studies in which stellar structures are obtained within the framework of newtonian dynamics .",
    "since we are interested in magnetar structures , the general relativistic treatment due to the strong gravity of magnetars is required in constructions of a magnetar model . however , a fully general relativistic means constructing a stellar model with arbitrarily magnetic structure are still not available . in most studies on the structures of relativistic magnetized stars , weak magnetic fields and/or purely poloidal magnetic fields have been assumed .",
    "bocquet et al .",
    "@xcite and cardall et al .",
    "@xcite have treated relativistic stellar models containing purely poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "konno et al .",
    "@xcite have analyzed similar models using a perturbative approach .",
    "ioka and sasaki have investigated structures of mixed poloidal - toroidal magnetic fields around a spherical star by using a perturbative technique  @xcite .",
    "as shown in core - collapse supernova mhd simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the toroidal magnetic fields can be easily amplified because of the winding up of the initial seed poloidal fields as long as the core is rotating differentially .",
    "after core bounce , as a result , the toroidal fields dominate over the poloidal ones in some proto - neutron star models even if there is no toroidal field initially .",
    "this winding up amplification of the toroidal magnetic fields therefore indicates that some neutron stars could have toroidal fields much higher than poloidal ones .",
    "as mentioned before , however , no effect of a strong toroidal magnetic field has been taken into account in relativistic magnetized stellar models . in order to elucidate the effects of strong toroidal magnetic fields on neutron star structures , in this paper , we concentrate on magnetic effects due to purely toroidal fields on structures of relativistic stars as a first step . within the framework of the newtonian dynamics",
    ", miketinac has obtained highly magnetized stars containing purely toroidal magnetic fields  @xcite . in this study , we extend miketinac s models so as to include the effects of general relativity and rotation .    first of all , we derive master equations for obtaining relativistic rotating stellar models having purely toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "the master equations obtained are converted into integral expressions and solved numerically with a self - consistent field scheme similar to the komatsu - eriguchi - hachisu scheme for equilibrium structures of relativistic rotating stars  @xcite . using the numerical scheme written in the present study , we construct a large number of equilibrium stars for a wide range of parameters .",
    "as shown by trehan & uberoi  @xcite , the toroidal magnetic field tends to distort a stellar shape prolately .",
    "this is because the toroidal magnetic field lines behave like a rubber belt , pulling in the matter around the magnetic axis .",
    "such a prolate - shaped neutron star may be an optimal source of gravitational waves if the star rotates  @xcite . in this gravitational wave emission mechanism , one important parameter is degree of prolateness , which determines the amount of gravitational radiation .",
    "thus , we pay attention to the deformation of the star .",
    "we also construct sequences of the equilibrium stars along which the total baryon rest mass and/or the magnetic flux with respect to the meridional cross - section keep constant .",
    "these equilibrium sequences are available for exploring evolutionary sequences because the total baryon rest mass and the magnetic flux are well conserved in quasi - steady evolution of isolated neutron stars .",

    "the rotating relativistic stars containing purely toroidal magnetic fields are considered in this paper . assumptions to obtain the equilibrium models are summarized as follows ; ( 1 ) equilibrium models are stationary and axisymmetric , i.e. the spacetime has the time killing vector , @xmath5 , and the rotational killing vector , @xmath6 , and lie derivatives of the physical quantities of the equilibrium models with respect to these killing vectors vanish .",
    "( 2 ) the matter source is approximated by a perfect fluid with infinite conductivity .",
    "( 3 ) there is no meridional flow of the matter .",
    "( 4 ) the equation of state for the matter is barotropic . by virtue of assumption",
    "( 3 ) , the matter four - velocity is reduced to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the angular velocity of the matter .",
    "we further assume that the magnetic field of the star has toroidal parts only , so that the faraday tensor , @xmath9 , obeys the conditions , given by @xmath10 note that since eq .",
    "( [ eq : fraday ] ) includes five independent conditions , we see that the faraday tensor has one independent component only .",
    "thanks to the conditions assumed above , one of the maxwell equations and the perfect - conductivity condition , @xmath11 } = 0,\\label{eq : maxwel}\\\\ & & f_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\nu      = 0,\\label{eq : mhd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are automatically satisfied , and we need not consider them any further .",

    "here , we have defined the magnetic field measured by the observer with the fluid four - velocity @xmath18 as @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for the contravariant levi - civita tensor with @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 denotes the determinant of the metric . by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4-vel])([eq : fraday ] ) , ( [ eq : mhd])([eq : stress - tensor ] ) , and ( [ eq : bfield ] ) , we can prove that the circularity condition , i.e. , @xmath23 } =   \\varphi_\\alpha t^{\\alpha[\\beta } t^\\gamma \\varphi^{\\delta ] } = 0 $ ] , is satisfied in the present situation  @xcite . note that a similar argument about the circularity has been given by oron  @xcite .",
    "therefore , there exists a family of two - surfaces everywhere orthogonal to the plane defined by the two killing vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite , and the metric can be written , following  @xcite , in the form      where the metric potentials , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , are functions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 only .",
    "we see that the non - zero component of @xmath9 in this coordinate is @xmath31 .",
    "it is convenient to define the determinants of two two - dimensional subspaces for later discussion ,                    where @xmath39 is the specific enthalpy and we have assumed the uniform rotation , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
