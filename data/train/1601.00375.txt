    "another way to solve the issues is to rely on the role of baryonic physics in the formation of galaxies and their satellites , including the suppression effects of the ionizing uv background and stellar feedback such as supernova explosion on galaxy formation as well as tidal effects of a centrally concentrated host galaxy on its satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in this context , nearby dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies as satellites of the milky way and andromeda galaxies provide ideal sites for studying the nature of dark matter , because stellar dynamics of the resolved member stars suggest that these galaxies are significantly dominated by associated dark matter halos with mass - to - light ratios of 10 to 1000 or more @xcite . for this reason",
    ", extensive dynamical analyses for these local dsphs have been performed to set constraints on the detailed internal structures of their dark halos and ultimately to get important insights into the nature of dark matter on small scales .",
    "these dynamical analyses of dsphs revealed several universal structures of their dark halos . @xcite and more recently , @xcite , proposed , based on spherically symmetric mass models , that all the dsphs with luminosities in the range of @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xmath10 have a common dark - halo mass of @xmath11 @xmath1 inside an inner 300  pc radius . following this work",
    ", @xcite showed that this constancy of @xmath12 can be naturally explained in the framework of @xmath7cdm theory combined with galaxy formation physics , where the latter process narrows an allowed range of circular velocities of dark halos .",
    "more recently @xcite showed the growth history of dark halos in this common @xmath12 scale and the resultant impacts on the star formation activity in dwarf satellite galaxies .    other work including @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have shown that for the assumed cored isothermal profile or so - called burkert profile @xcite with a density @xmath13 and radius @xmath14 of a core component , the central surface density of a cored dark halo , @xmath15 , is found to be constant , irrespective of the observed @xmath16-band luminosities of galaxies .",
    "the similar universality of a central surface density of a cored dark halo has been proposed by @xcite , arriving at @xmath17 @xmath1  pc@xmath2 for both cored isothermal and burkert profiles .",
    "these work indeed provide important constraints on the structure of dark halos and thus on the nature of dark matter .",
    "recently , @xcite , hereafter referred to as hc15a , proposed a yet another universal scale for the internal structure of dark halos , motivated by the facts that realistic dynamical analysis of non - spherical dsphs based on axisymmetric jeans equations yields a rather large dispersion in the values of @xmath12 @xcite and that the constancy of @xmath18 can not be applicable to any density profiles including a dark halo with a central cusp .",
    "hc15a showed for galaxies spanning the circular velocities of 10 to 400 km  s@xmath6 that a mean surface density of a dark halo within the radius of the maximum circular velocity , hereafter denoted as @xmath19 , is remarkably constant , irrespective of the different density distributions in each of the galaxies .",
    "it is also shown that this constancy of @xmath19 is applied to all the galaxies with @xmath16-band luminosities over almost 14 orders of magnitude , @xmath20 to @xmath21 mag @xcite , i.e. including faint dsphs to bright spiral / elliptical galaxies .    in this paper , we investigate the evolution of dark matter halos in this common surface - density scale and the resultant impacts on star formation activity in dwarf satellite galaxies , following the work of @xcite in which the common mass scale of @xmath22 for dark halos is assumed .",
    "we thus show how the growth histories of dark halos differ between the case of @xmath23 and that of @xmath22 and how these different assembly histories of dark matter affect the baryonic content and star formation rate in these small - scale dark halos and how the results are compatible with the observed properties of dwarf satellite galaxies in the milky way and andromeda galaxies .",

    "the ram - pressure stripping may also be at work to prevent further gas infall and thus star formation .",
    "thus we expect that the main star formation activity in each of dwarf galaxies occurs prior to @xmath3 , where the continuous growth of dark halos accompanies gas inflow simultaneously , from which new stars are formed .",
    "following this conjecture , we calculate the inflow rate of gas from outside , based on the associated mass growth in a dark halo component . for this purpose",

    "this equation corresponds to the growth rate of the mean most massive progenitor for halos , which now belong to the common surface - density scale family in this work .",
    "we assume that the inflow rate of gas is simply given as the baryon fraction times the growth rate of a dark halo , i.e. , being proportional to @xmath132 .        in this work ,",
    "we choose fornax and leo ii as two representative cases , where the epochs of tidal truncation under a constraint of the common surface - density scale of 20 @xmath1  pc@xmath2 are given as @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively , i.e. subsequent and prior to the completion of the cosmic reionization . for these dsphs , the values of @xmath101 indicating star formation efficiency",
    "are estimated as 0.065 ( fornax ) and 0.212 ( leo ii ) , thereby suggesting that the former dsph with @xmath3 being lower than the redshift for the completion of the cosmic reionization is subject to the suppression of star formation caused by the ionizing background radiation .    to estimate the star formation histories in these dsphs , we adopt the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "results by @xcite for the milky way dsphs , based on the distribution of resolved member stars in the color - magnitude diagram . since in the @xcite paper , they showed the cumulative star formation rate ( sfr ) , we evaluate the sfr at each epoch by differentiating the cumulative sfr .",

    "in these lower panels , the inflow rate of gas is maximum at redshift @xmath3 , i.e. at the epoch of tidal truncation when a subhalo enters into a host halo at the corresponding epoch .",
    "figure [ fig : inflow ] suggests that the observed peak of the star formation rate in fornax and leo  ii is indeed in good agreement with the epoch when the peak of the gas infall rate is achieved .",
    "this implies that star formation activity in these dwarf satellites may be controlled by the mass growth in a dark halo component under a constraint of the common surface - density scale of @xmath135 @xmath1  pc@xmath2 yielding @xmath3 , i.e. , the peak epoch of the gas infall rate , and this epoch is to be compared with the completion epoch of the cosmic reionization to infer the effect on star formation efficiency .",
    "further tests for the current semi - analytical model are needed , in which much tighter limits on star formation histories of these galaxies , e.g. based on measurements of detailed abundance patterns of member stars , may enable us to deduce any differences in star formation efficiency between the two families of dsphs .",
    "we have investigated the mass growth of dark halos in dwarf galaxy satellites in local group galaxies , under the recently proposed property by hc15a that the mean surface density of a dark halo inside a radius at maximum circular velocity is universal over a large range of luminosities and masses of galaxies . following that this surface density @xmath19 with 20 @xmath1  pc@xmath2 well explains dwarf satellite galaxies in the milky way and andromeda galaxies",
    ", we calculate the evolution of dark halos and associated evolutionary histories of the baryonic component in dwarf satellites .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .",
    "* dark halos in the common surface - density scale show the rapid mass growth at high redshifts , while they evolve only slowly at lower redshifts of @xmath136 .",
    "it is found that these dark halos cover a large range of @xmath0 including the scales of ufds with @xmath0 as small as 10  km  s@xmath6 as well as those of bright galaxies with @xmath0 as large as a few hundred km  s@xmath6 .",
    "this is in contrast to dark halos in the common mass scale of @xmath137 @xmath1  pc@xmath2 , which covers only a limited range of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the mean surface density @xmath19 provides a more general description for the evolution of dark halos . *",
    "the calculation of the baryon fraction retained in these dark halos in the presence of the ionizing background radiation reveals that low - mass satellites with @xmath30 below @xmath138 km  s@xmath6 are characterized by high star formation efficiency of @xmath109 , whereas more massive satellites with @xmath0 being larger than @xmath138 km  s@xmath6 show low star formation efficiency of @xmath110 .",
    "this is understood on the basis of the mass growth of dark halos and its termination at @xmath3 in the following manner .",
    "low @xmath0 halos grow fast at high redshifts and are less affected by the ionizing radiation , whereby star formation efficiency is high . on the contrary",
    ", high @xmath0 halos grow slowly at lower redshifts , so that star formation is suppressed by the ionizing background .",
    "it is also suggested from these models that more than 70  % of baryon ( i.e. , @xmath139 ) have been lost from each dwarf satellite , in good agreement with suggestions from chemical evolution models to explain low metallicities of stars in the observed dsphs .",
    "* we have found that the values of @xmath101 in subhalos calculated from the illustris simulation are in agreement with those derived from our semi - analytical models , implying that our models may describe the realistic evolutionary histories of dark halos and baryonic matter , although further studies based on much higher - resolution numerical simulations are needed to assess the detailed properties of star formation activities in satellites , especially at small @xmath0 . *",
    "the infall rate of gas inferred from the growth rate of dark halos in the common surface - density scale shows a peak at the epoch of tidal truncation and this peak epoch is reasonably in agreement with the epoch at which the star formation rate derived for the milky way satellites ( fornax and leo  ii ) is maximum .",
    "this also implies that the evolution of a dark halo may play a key role in understanding star formation histories in dwarf satellite galaxies .",
