    "palomar 14 is one of the least luminous globular clusters ( gcs ) of the milky way ( @xmath2 ) and it is located in the outer halo of the milky way at a distance from the sun @xmath3 ( sollima et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter s11 ) .",
    "these characteristics make this object particularly interesting from a kinematical point of view : both its internal and external accelerations are weaker than the characteristic acceleration of the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ; milgrom 1983 ) @xmath4 and its low binding energy makes this stellar system prone to a significant tidal stress .    in recent years , this cluster has been the object of many investigations focused on its peculiar structure and kinematics .",
    "pal 14 has been indeed indicated as one of the best candidates to test mond ( baumgardt et al .",
    "2005 ; sollima & nipoti 2010 ; haghi et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ) because the global projected velocity dispersions predicted by the classical newtonian theory and mond differ significantly for this stellar system .",
    "unfortunately , the distance and mass of pal 14 imply that only a bunch of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars within the half - mass radius appear brighter than the limiting magnitude ( @xmath5 ) of high - resolution spectrographs mounted on 8m - class telescopes .",
    "for this reason , the only high - resolution spectroscopic analysis available for pal 14 ( jordi et al .",
    "2009 ; hereafter j09 ) derived accurate radial velocities for only 17 member stars . j09",
    "compared the projected velocity dispersion of the system with the outcome of a set of n - body simulations , reporting that the expected velocity dispersion in mond is more than three times higher than the observed value .",
    "they concluded that the measured velocity dispersion of pal 14 represents a problem for mond .",
    "gentile et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , using a kolmogorov - smirnov test on the observed and predicted mond distributions of velocities , claimed that the confidence level achievable using the small sample of stars used by j09 does not allow to rule out mond .",
    "on the other hand , kupper & kroupa ( 2010 ) used a large set of n - body realizations of pal 14 in the framework of the classical newtonian dynamics including the effect of a variable fraction of binaries and found that a fraction of binaries @xmath6 would be incompatible with the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "they argued that newtonian gravity is challenged by the observed kinematics of pal 14 , unless the cluster hosts an unusually small number of binaries .",
    "however , a larger binary fraction is expected to be present in this loose cluster both from theoretical arguments ( kroupa 1995 ) and from considerations on the observed fraction of blue straggler stars ( beccari et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this case , according to kupper & kroupa ( 2010 ) , the observational evidence would suggest a gravitational force _ weaker _ than the newtonian one in the low - acceleration regime ( i.e. in the opposite direction of what mond predicts ) .",
    "recent attempts to model the kinematics of pal 14 with n - body simulations have also revealed difficulties in reproducing the present - day mass - function and structure of this stellar system starting from a standard initial mass function ( imf ; zoonozi et al .",
    "therefore , peculiar starting conditions ( like flattened imf and/or primordial mass - segregation ) could characterize this cluster .",
    "the situation recently became even more complicated : a pair of tidal tails surrounding the cluster has been discovered ( s11 ) , suggesting that the galactic tidal field is important and questioning the validity of models that treat the cluster as isolated .",
    "in this paper we try to shed light on the controversial interpretation of the kinematics of pal 14 by presenting a statistical analysis of its projected velocity dispersion based on a monte carlo approach .",
    "we used the sample of radial velocities of j09 and a set of n - body simulations in both newtonian gravity and mond , investigating the effect of different assumptions on @xmath0 , binary fraction , degree of anisotropy and cluster orbit .",
    "for the present analysis we used the sample of radial velocities obtained by j09 .",
    "it consists of 27 stars observed in the innermost 4 arcminutes of pal 14 selected along the cluster red giant branch .",
    "it has been constructed from high - resolution ( @xmath7 ) spectra collected with two different spectrographs : uves@vlt and hires@kecki .",
    "a detailed description of the reduction procedure and of the radial velocity measure can be found in j09 .",
    "the high - resolution allows to obtain very accurate radial velocities with errors of @xmath8 . a number of outliers ( field stars )",
    "can be easily identified at velocities @xmath9 .",
    "the bona - fide cluster members turn out to constitute a sample of 16 stars plus one star ( # 15 ) lying at @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) so that it is not clear if it is a true cluster member , a binary star or a field outlier . in the following analysis",
    "we will always consider the two samples defined including and excluding this star .",
    "the error weighted averages of the bona - fide cluster members are @xmath12 ( without star # 15 ) and @xmath13 ( with star # 15 ) . to calculate the velocity dispersion we searched for the value of @xmath14 that maximizes the logarithm of the probability density @xmath15 } { 2\\pi \\sigma_{v } \\delta_{i } } dv ' \\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i}\\left ( \\frac{(v_{i}-\\overline{v})^2}{\\sigma_{v}^2+\\delta_{i}^{2 } } + \\ln [ 2\\pi(\\sigma_{v}^2+\\delta_{i}^{2})]\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the velocity of the @xmath18-th star and its associated uncertainty ( see pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "the so - calculated velocity dispersions turn out to be @xmath19 ( without star # 15 ) and @xmath20 ( with star # 15 ) .",
    "the models adopted in this paper are based on a set of n - body simulations performed in the framework of both the newtonian and mond theories of gravity considering the cluster immersed in the gravitational field of the milky way . as we will show in sect .",
    "[ nbody_sec ] , the effect of the external field is an essential ingredient for a proper comparison of the velocity dispersion of this low - mass cluster with observations , in particular when the mond theory is considered .",
    "it is however instructive to show also the predictions of a set of isolated analytical models to provide the necessary reference to quantify the effect of the external field and to investigate the effect of different degrees of anisotropy . in the following sections we will describe the complete set of models and simulations used in this paper .      under the hypothesis that the cluster is isolated and spherically symmetric",
    ", simple models can be constructed by solving the jeans equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the density , @xmath23 is the gravitational potential , @xmath24 is the anisotropy parameter , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are , respectively , the radial and tangential components of the velocity dispersion tensor at the radius @xmath27 . if the system is self - gravitating , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are related in newtonian gravity by the poisson equation @xmath28 while in mond by the corresponding modified field equation ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) @xmath29=4\\pi g \\rho,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the so - called `` interpolating function '' such that @xmath31 at @xmath32 ( the so - called `` deep - mond '' regime ) and @xmath33 at @xmath34 ( the newtonian regime ) . in the following",
    "we use the `` simple '' interpolating function @xmath35 ( famaey & binney 2005 ) . for finite - mass isolated systems",

    "can be solved to obtain @xmath25 .",
    "the tangential component of the velocity dispersion @xmath26 is then derived from eq .",
    "( [ beta_eq ] ) and the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity dispersion at any given projected distance @xmath40 from the center is given by @xmath41 } { { r}\\sqrt{{r}^{2}-r^{2}}}d{r}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the projected density at @xmath40 and @xmath43 is the tidal radius . the above procedure allows to calculate a los velocity dispersion profile for any given choice of @xmath0 and @xmath39 according to both newtonian and mond theories .",
    "we adopted the density profile of the king ( 1966 ) model that best - fits the data of s11 defined by the parameters @xmath44 which have been converted in physical units assuming a distance of @xmath45 kpc and two different values of the mass - to - light ratio : @xmath46=1.885 ( derived for pal 14 from stellar population synthesis by mclaughlin & van der marel 2005 ) and @xmath46=0.747 ( corresponding to the minimum mass estimated by j09 from star counts in the color - magnitude diagram ) .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to the m / l ratio in the v band simply as m / l . regarding the degree of anisotropy",
    ", we considered , besides the isotropic case ( @xmath47 ) , two extreme anisotropic cases : purely tangential ( @xmath48 ) and maximally radial . in the latter case we adopted the osipkov - merritt parametrization ( osipkov 1979 ; merritt 1985 ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the anisotropy radius , which sets the boundary where orbits become significantly radially biased ( systems with smaller @xmath50 are more radially anisotropic ) .",
    "we assumed @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the bona - fide minimum value for of @xmath50 for stability against radial - orbit instability .",
    "in particular , we adopt @xmath53 for the newtonian model and @xmath54 for the mond one , corresponding to the marginal condition for stability @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the radial and tangential kinetic energies computed within the half - mass radius @xmath58 ; nipoti et al .",
    "2011 ; ibata et al .",
    "2011a ) .",
    "the los velocity dispersion profiles of all these models , calculated by integrating numerically the above equations , are shown in fig .",
    "it is evident that , at least as long as the cluster is treated as isolated , mond models predict a significantly larger velocity dispersion with respect to newtonian ones ( see also baumgardt et al . 2005 ; sollima & nipoti 2010 ; haghi et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "newtonian and mond velocity dispersion profiles are clearly distinct , regardless of the assumed anisotropy profile .",
    "as already reported above , all the models presented in the previous section are based on the assumption that the cluster is isolated . however , it is known that the presence of the galactic field is important for pal 14 ( see sect .",
    "[ intro_sec ] ) , with different effects depending of the considered gravity law . in particular :    * in newtonian gravity , the tidal interaction with the galactic potential can alter the velocity dispersion of the system by heating stars at large distances from the center , by producing virial oscillations after tidal shocks and influencing its structural evolution ; * in mond , besides the above tidal effects , even the presence of a uniform external field breaks the spherical symmetry of the gravitation field and can lead the cluster toward a less deep mond regime ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) .    to account properly for the above effects we used a set of n - body simulations performed in both newtonian gravity and mond . in the newtonian case we studied the tidal effects by simulating the evolution of the cluster orbiting within the galactic potential . in the mond case we used n - body simulations to model the cluster in the presence of a uniform external field ,",
    "so for simplicity we neglected the tidal effects .",
    "we note that , given the very long two - body relaxation time of pal 14 ( @xmath59 ; s11 ) , its time evolution can be simulated also with collisionless n - body codes , which is especially convenient in mond , because of the difficulty in realizing a collisional n - body code in this non - linear theory .      lccccccr model & @xmath60 & e & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & m & @xmath63 & @xmath64 + # & & ( @xmath65 ) & ( km / s kpc ) & ( gyr ) & ( @xmath66 ) & & ( pc ) + 37/39 & 0.002 & 15962.05 & 9100 & 2.04 & 50000 & 9 & 12.6 + 41/43 & 0.5 & 5661.36 & 6300 & 2.23 & 380000 & 12 & 12.6 + 45/47 & 0.002 & 15962.05 & 9100 & 2.04 & 105000 & 12 & 12.6 + 49/51 & 0.5 & 5661.36 & 6300 & 2.23 & 170000 & 12 & 12.6 +    as already discussed in sect .",
    "[ nbody_sec ] , the tidal interaction between pal 14 and the milky way is expected to heat the outskirts of the cluster . this can be the result of both compressive shocks occurred during the disk crossing and perigalactic passages ( ostriker et al .",
    "1972 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) and the sudden change in the underlying potential ( like in the case of the sagittarius galaxy ; taylor & babul 2001 ) .",
    "after these episodes , the kinetic energy of a fraction of the cluster stars can exceed the boundaries of the cluster potential well and these stars become `` potential escapers '' ( kupper et al .",
    "these stars might have a velocity dispersion larger than the other bound stars and remain within the cluster in spite of their positive energy for a timescale comparable to the cluster orbital period ( lee & ostriker 1987 ) .",
    "moreover , the strong perturbations occurring after every disk passage affect the cluster virial equilibrium ( and consequently its internal kinematics ) producing damped oscillations which go on for many dynamical times ( gnedin & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "finally , the structural evolution of the cluster is also influenced by tides which accelerate the process of mass - loss ( gnedin et al .",
    "the overall effect on the cluster velocity dispersion is therefore extremely complex and not obviously resulting in a heating / freezing .    to evaluate the effect of tides on the velocity dispersion of pal 14 we ran a set of n - body simulations .",
    "we used the last version of nbsymple ( capuzzo - dolcetta et al .",
    "2011 ) , an efficient n - body integrator implemented on a hybrid cpu + gpu platform exploiting a double - parallelization on cpus and on the hosted graphic processing units ( gpus ) .",
    "the precision is guaranteed resorting to direct summation ( to avoid truncation errors in force evaluation ) , and on the usage of high order , symplectic time integration methods ( kinoshita et al .",
    "1991 ; yoshida 1991 ) .",
    "in particular the code allows to choose between two different symplectic integrators : a second order algorithm ( commonly known as leapfrog ) and a much more accurate ( but also time consuming ) sixth order method .",
    "the effect of the external galactic field is taken into account using an analytical representation of its gravitational potential .",
    "we adopted a leap - frog scheme with a time - step of @xmath67 and a softening length of 0.2 pc ( following the prescription of dehnen & read 2011 ) . such a relatively large time - step and softening length",
    "do not affect the accuracy of the simulation , because , as mentioned above , the effects of two - body encounters has been found to be negligible in this cluster even in its innermost region ( s11 ; beccari et al .",
    "2011 ) and the relaxation times at the half - mass radius of our models are larger than the cluster age during the entire simulation .",
    "the cluster was launched within the three - component ( bulge + disc + halo ) static galactic potential of johnston et al .",
    "( 1995 ) on two orbits with different eccentricities ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "first of all , we integrated backward in time , within the adopted potential , the orbit of a test particle from the apocenter ( assumed to be the present - day location of the cluster at r=45.75 kpc , z=47.68 kpc , in cylindrical coordinates centered on the galactic center ) to the epoch @xmath70 ago . at the end of the simulation ,",
    "the model is within 40 pc of the current position of pal 14 and the energy has been conserved within @xmath71 for both the considered orbits .",
    "then the simulation has been launched with a cluster represented by 61,440 equal - mass particles distributed according to an equilibrium king ( 1966 ) model having initial mass , core radius and concentration empirically determined so that the projected density profile after two complete orbits reproduces the present - day cluster configuration ( see sect .",
    "[ analyt_sec ] ) .",
    "the initial conditions of the simulation for the two adopted orbits are reported in table 1 .    in fig .",
    "[ tides1 ] the final projected density and los velocity dispersion profiles are shown for the considered combinations of values of orbital eccentricity and m / l . it can be noted that in all cases the effect of tidal heating is visible only in the outermost radial bins of the projected density profiles , but a significant deviation from the predicted behavior of the isolated model is clearly visible in the velocity dispersion profiles beyond a distance from the cluster center which depends on the orbital eccentricity and the adopted m / l ratio . on the other hand , the isolated model remains a good representation of the cluster velocity dispersion at small distance from the cluster center , where most of the stars of the j09 sample reside .",
    "the gravitational field of the galaxy at the location of pal 14 is estimated to be , in modulus , @xmath72 ( johnston et al . 1995 ) and directed approximately towards the galactic center . during its orbit",
    "the cluster will occupy different galactic regions where the external field differs both in direction and in magnitude .",
    "the effect of such a variation on the internal kinematics of the cluster can be in principle significant ( kosowsky 2010 ) and is linked to the ratio between the timescale necessary to the cluster to reach a new equilibrium configuration ( @xmath73 ; which is of the order of the internal dynamical time @xmath74 ) and the orbital period ( @xmath62 ) . although the orbit of pal 14 is unknown we can set an upper limit to this ratio by assuming the cluster presently at its apocenter and considering different orbital eccentricities . as a first order approximation ,",
    "we calculated the orbital period assuming planar orbits within a spherical isothermal galactic potential @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 is the galactocentric distance ) with @xmath77 , so @xmath78 at @xmath79 ( the present - day galactocentric distance of pal 14 ) . the dynamical time has been calculated as @xmath80 adopting the cluster potential @xmath81 as in the isotropic mond model of pal 14 with @xmath0=1.885 .",
    "the ratio @xmath82 is relatively small : even in the extreme case of a free falling orbit ( @xmath83 ) we get @xmath84 at the half - mass radius . to visualize the effect of the variation of the external acceleration on the internal cluster kinematics , we plot in fig .",
    "[ orb ] the external acceleration exerted on the cluster after a time interval @xmath85 from the current position ( bottom panel ) for two different eccentric orbits ( @xmath69 and 1 ) and the fraction of mass comprised within the radius where @xmath861 , 2 and 5 .",
    "it is evident that assuming @xmath87=1 , more than 80% of the cluster stars reach the equilibrium with the external field within 100 myr , a timescale during which the cluster feels an almost constant external acceleration ( always smaller than @xmath88 ) , regardless of its orbit .",
    "a more significant variation is instead noticeable assuming @xmath73 of the order of few dynamical times : if @xmath87=5 the external field doubles in the case of an orbit with eccentricity @xmath69 before @xmath89 of the cluster stars reached equilibrium , and the effect can be even more significant in the case of the free - falling orbit .    to evaluate the effect of the external field on the predicted velocity dispersion we used the mond n - body code n - mody ( londrillo & nipoti 2009 ) , in which we implemented the external field effect as described in ibata et al .",
    "( 2011a ) .",
    "the presence of an uniform external field @xmath90 is accounted for in the boundary conditions of equation  ( [ mond_eq ] ) , which become @xmath91 for @xmath37 ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) .",
    "we recall that , due to technical difficulties , in mond we do not simulate self - consistently the evolution of pal 14 orbiting in the galaxy ( including tidal effects ) , but we limit ourselves to simple numerical experiments that should allow us to estimate reasonably well the effect of a uniform external field on the cluster velocity dispersion . in the simplest of our experiments we simulate the cluster in the presence of a uniform external field @xmath92 that remains constant in modulus and direction throughout the simulation ( see also ibata et al .",
    "2011a ) . in particular , in the attempt to model the cluster on a circular orbit , we fix @xmath93 ( the value of the external field at the present - day location of pal  14 ) . in these simulations ( which hereafter we refer to , loosely speaking , as @xmath94 mond simulations )",
    "we let the cluster evolve for @xmath95 ( i.e. slightly more than a complete orbital period ) .    if the cluster is on an eccentric orbit , not only the direction , but also the modulus of the external field varies during the orbit .",
    "in particular , if pal 14 is currently at the apocenter it must have experienced a stronger external field in the past , which might affect to some degree its present - day velocity dispersion . in order to explore this effect , we also ran simulations in which the external field varies in time ( in modulus , but not in direction ) as expected for the @xmath69 orbit discussed above ( see fig .",
    "[ orb ] , bottom panel ) . in these simulations",
    "we follow the evolution of the cluster for @xmath96 ( i.e. half orbit , starting at the apocenter ) : so , in this case the external field is @xmath97 at @xmath98 , it reaches a its maximum @xmath99 at @xmath100 and at the end of the simulation is again @xmath97 ( loosely speaking hereafter we refer to these simulations as the @xmath69 mond simulations ) .    for each value of @xmath0 ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 )",
    "we ran both the @xmath94 and the @xmath69 mond simulations . in all cases",

    "the cluster is continuously slowly evolving due to the variation of the external field . in both cases the end - products of the simulations are axisymmetric configurations with symmetry axis along the direction of the external field .",
    "when projected along the line - of - sight to pal 14 ( assuming that the field of the galaxy points toward the galactic center ) the systems appear almost circular ( with ellipticity @xmath110 ) and with circularized surface - density distribution very similar to the observed light distribution of pal 14 ( see fig .",

    "[ efe1 ] we also show the velocity dispersion profiles of the end - products of the @xmath94 and @xmath69 mond simulations ( right panels ) .",

    "it is interesting to note that anisotropy has only a small effect on the predicted distribution of velocity dispersions .",

    "[ mond_sec ] , it is apparent that the inclusion of the external field significantly affects the predicted velocity dispersion reducing the systemic velocity dispersion . for a @xmath0=1.885 ( the one predicted by stellar evolution models for pal 14 ) , it is clear that the predicted velocity dispersion , though significantly influenced by the external field , remains in any case higher than the observed value ( fig .",
    "[ efe2 ] ) .",
    "a small , but not negligible ( @xmath145% ) , number of realizations compatible with observations are noticeable when a stronger external field and a 5@xmath136 rejection threshold are considered .",
    "note that a non - zero binary fraction and the tidal heating ( not included in these simulations ) could inflate the model velocity dispersion making the discrepancy between the mond predictions and the data even larger . instead , for a lower @xmath0=0.747 ratio the predictions of mond models agree with the measured velocity dispersion ( see fig .",
    "[ efe4 ] ) .",
    "so we conclude that the adoption of a low @xmath0 ratio , in association with the adoption of a 5@xmath136 rejection criterion and/or a large orbital eccentricity , could reconcile mond with the observed properties of pal 14 .      in fig .",

    ". such difference can well be responsible for the higher predicted velocity dispersion and the corresponding smaller limit to the cluster binary fraction found by kupper & kroupa ( 2010 ) .",
    "the n - body simulations described in sect .",
    "[ newt_sec ] allow to evaluate the effect that tides have in the stellar kinematics of pal 14 in the framework of the classical newtonian dynamics .",
    "quantifying this effect is important since it can potentially affect the cluster velocity dispersion measured through the j09 sample ( kupper et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the output distributions of predicted velocity dispersions for the two orbits are compared to the isolated model in fig .",
    "[ tides2 ] and fig .",
    "[ tides3 ] for m / l=1.885 and m / l=0.747 , respectively .",
    "it is apparent that the effect of tidal heating is negligible in all cases .",
    "a small difference is noticeable only in the m / l=0.747 case when eccentric orbits are considered : in this case the distribution , while having the same peak value , present a larger dispersion and a tail extending toward larger velocity dispersions .",
    "the reason of this result can be found by looking at the spatial distribution of the j09 sample : 16 out 17 target stars reside in the inner 2 arcminutes , a region where tides have only a minor heating efficiency ( see fig . [ tides1 ] ) .",
    "the effect is indeed slightly more evident when a small m / l and an eccentric orbit are considered , since the effect of heating penetrates deeper into the cluster affecting the velocity of the two outermost targets .",
    "we conclude that the upper limit in the binary fraction derived in sect .",
    "[ binres_sec ] is not altered by this effect , at least for the two considered orbits .",
    "using a monte carlo approach , we performed an accurate comparison of the velocity dispersion of the globular cluster pal 14 measured from high - resolution radial velocities with the predictions of a set of dynamical models spanning a wide range in @xmath0 ratio , degree of anisotropy , binary fraction and orbital eccentricity in both newtonian and mond gravity .",
    "the obtained results indicate that newtonian models with a binary fraction @xmath1 and a @xmath0 ratio compatible with the predictions of stellar evolutionary models are in good agreement with the kinematics of this stellar system . on the other hand mond models with the same @xmath0 ratio appear to systematically overpredict the velocity dispersion for any assumption of the cluster anisotropy . the same conclusion has been reached previously by j09 but questioned by gentile et al .",
    "note that all these previous approaches compared the velocity dispersion with the prediction of theoretical models neglecting the information on the radial distribution of targets .",
    "this has an important impact in increasing the significance of the comparison as most of targets are actually located in the central part of the cluster where the difference between newtonian and mond models is maximized .",
    "moreover , our simulations showed the importance of the inclusion of the external field in the determining the velocity dispersion profile of mond models for this cluster .",
    "this warns against using isolated mond models for clusters with masses and galactocentric distances similar to pal 14 ( see also baumgardt et al . 2005 , haghi et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "similar difficulties for mond in explaining the internal kinematics of gcs have been already found in previous studies on ngc2419 ( baumgardt et al .",
    "2009 ; sollima & nipoti 2010 ; ibata et al .",
    "2011a , b ) . in this last case",
    "the effect of the external field , which is a factor 1.4 weaker in modulus and @xmath15023 times smaller with respect to the cluster internal acceleration than in pal 14 , has been estimated to be negligible ( ibata et al . 2011a ) .",
    "the conclusions are different when significantly lower values of @xmath0 are considered for pal 14 . in this case",
    "the predictions of mond models are close the observed velocity dispersion ( in particular when a 5@xmath136 rejection criterion is adopted and eccentric orbits are considered ) , while newtonian models predict a lower velocity dispersion .",
    "so , a combination of small @xmath0 ratio , small binary fraction , relatively large orbital eccentricity and the adoption of a permissive rejection criterion provides a way - out for mond .",
    "as the @xmath0 ratio is a crucial parameter in the presented analysis , it is interesting to discuss in more detail the possibility of constraining its value .    from a theoretical point of view , the m / l ratio of an old",
    ", metal - poor stellar population composed mainly by subsolar - mass stars is expected to be systematically larger than unity ( @xmath151 ; fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ) and can reach @xmath152 if dark remnants are taken into account ( kruijssen 2009 ) . on the other hand , observational analyses performed on gcs in the milky way and",
    "m31 have shown the occurrence of a sparse number of clusters with m / l values as small as m / l@xmath1500.6 ( strader et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the low m / l=0.747 ratio adopted here corresponds to the minimum mass calculated by j09 assuming a decreasing mass function for stellar masses smaller than the limiting magnitude of deep photometric hst observations of pal 14 and neglecting the effect of dark remnants .",
    "so @xmath101 must be considered a strong lower limit .",
    "on the other hand , while the value of m / l=1.885 derived by mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) assumes a standard chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , j09 measured a shallower mass function slope in the limited mass range covered by their observations which could in turn suggest a lower m / l as appropriate . in general , the dynamical m / l ratios measured in gcs appear generally smaller than those predicted by population synthesis models ( @xmath153 with some cluster with even smaller values ; mclaughlin & van der marel 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , in stellar systems with a small binding energy like pal 14 , the recoil speed of white dwarf remnants could exceed the cluster escape velocity , causing a substantial loss of dark remnants ( fellhauer et al .",
    "primordial mass segregation can also play a role favoring the losses of low - mass stars ( with high individual m / l ratio ; zoonozi et al .",
    "therefore , mass - to - light ratios substantially lower than that predicted by stellar evolution models can not be excluded .",
    "a very low binary fraction also appears disfavored ( see below ) , although direct estimates of the binary fraction in this cluster are still missing .",
    "the comparison between the observed velocity dispersion and the newtonian predictions sets an upper limit for the fraction of binaries in this cluster @xmath1 ( @xmath148 for the case of low m / l=0.747 ) , significantly higher than the upper limit ( @xmath154 ) estimated by kupper & kroupa ( 2010 ; see the discussion in section  [ binres_sec ] ) .",
    "these upper limits must be compared with independent estimates of the binary fraction of pal 14 .",
    "unfortunately , the deepest photometric studies on this cluster ( dotter et al .",
    "2008 ) barely reach @xmath155 magnitudes below the cluster turn - off , therefore preventing any direct estimate of the binary fraction .",
    "however , an indirect estimate of the binary content of pal 14 @xmath156 has been recently provided by beccari et al .",
    "( 2011 ) on the basis of the comparison between the fraction of blue straggler stars and binary fraction in clusters with similar mass and density .",
    "so , on the basis of the above estimate we conclude that the observed velocity dispersion of this cluster is consistent with the newtonian theory of gravity . also in this case , this result has been validated only for orbits with eccentricities @xmath157 .",
    "orbits with a larger eccentricity can in principle lead to a significant heating of the cluster also in its innermost region , where most of the j09 targets are located .",
    "however , we suggest that the available data do not provide any significant indication of a failure of the newtonian theory of gravity .    the present analysis can also be used to gain insight into the question of the dark matter content of pal 14 : in the framework of the classical newtonian dynamics the low observed velocity dispersion implies a dynamical @xmath158 ( for reasonable assumptions on the binary fraction and on the rejection criterion ) .",
    "this result , combined with the observation that pal 14 has significant tidal tails ( s11 ) , suggests that dark matter does not contribute substantially to the mass of this remote gc .",

    "<S> we present the results of a detailed analysis of the projected velocity dispersion of the globular cluster palomar 14 performed using recent high - resolution spectroscopic data and extensive monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the data and a set of dynamical models ( differing in fraction of binaries , degree of anisotropy , mass - to - light ratio @xmath0 , cluster orbit and theory of gravity ) shows that the observed velocity dispersion of this stellar system is well reproduced by newtonian models with a fraction of binaries @xmath1 and a @xmath0 compatible with the predictions of stellar evolution models . </S>",
    "<S> instead , models computed with a large fraction of binaries systematically overestimate the cluster velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that , across the parameter space sampled by our simulations , models based on the modified newtonian dynamics theory can be reconciled with observations only assuming values of @xmath0 lower than those predicted by stellar evolution models under standard assumptions . </S>"
