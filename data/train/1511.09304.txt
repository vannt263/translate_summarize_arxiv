    "quantum fluctuations of the inflaton are usually considered as the main contender for explaining the origin of the primordial curvature perturbation , with a host of inflaton models in existence @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the observed density perturbations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) could also be generated by an effectively massless scalar field other than the inflaton such as the curvaton @xcite , or by scalars in the modulated reheating scenarios @xcite . in those models ,",
    "the inflationary expansion is driven by the inflaton field while the energy density of the other scalar(s ) is not dynamically important during inflation .",
    "such a field is therefore called a  spectator field . \"    however , the effectively massless spectators are always subject to quantum fluctuations in the inflationary universe . at a later time",
    "these may be imprinted on the metric as a curvature perturbation .",
    "since the inflaton also acquires perturbations , in general the primordial fluctuations could be sourced both by the inflaton and some spectator fields .",
    "such a possibility is sometimes referred as the mixed inflaton and spectator field model .",
    "the issue at hand is then : how to test these different possibilities .    at the moment",
    "the most powerful tool for probing the primordial perturbation is provided by the precision observations of the cmb anisotropies by the planck satellite , which constrain possible models of inflation and/or inflaton potentials @xcite . however , in terms of inflationary efolds @xmath8 , the information thus obtained pertains a rather narrow range @xmath9 or so .",
    "this makes it difficult to determine spectral properties of the primordial perturbation on broad - scales , e.g. , the running of the spectral index , and to differentiate theoretical models .    in the near future there may however open up a new observational window on the primordial perturbation that could help to test models for the origin of the curvature perturbation over a much wider range of efolds .",
    "the basic idea is that the original cmb spectrum will generally obtain a very small deviation from the perfect black body by virtue of imperfect thermalization of the energy dissipated from density fluctuations . at early times",
    "the energy released into photons via silk damping is thermalized rapidly by the single and double compton scattering .",
    "however , at late times the double compton scattering becomes less effective . as a result",
    ", released energy is imprinted on the cmb spectrum as distortions , creating effectively a chemical potential when the kinetic equilibrium is maintained by the single compton scattering .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath0 distortion of the cmb , which can be detected in the future @xcite with a sensitivity by several orders of magnitude better than the current ones ( i.e. cobe firas @xcite ) and some studies have been performed focusing on the probing primordial fluctuations using the @xmath0 distortion @xcite .",
    "in general , the power spectra of fluctuations from different scalar fields exhibit different scale dependences .",
    "thus it is possible that , for example , fluctuations sourced by one field dominate on large scales , while those from another scalar field can give a significant contribution on smaller scales .",
    "if this were the case , the prediction of a model with only one scalar field could become inconsistent when the large and small scale observations are compared .",
    "such considerations could thus provide the means to differentiate between the single field and mixed models .",
    "this is where the determination of the @xmath0 distortion of the cmb can play a decisive role .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate models where the curvature perturbation has two sources .",
    "although our treatment is generic , we have mostly in mind mixed inflaton and spectator field models .",
    "we find constraints on such mixed source models from the current cmb observations and study the prospects for testing and constraining mixed models by the @xmath0 distortion of cmb .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the mixed source model to be investigated and summarize the formalism needed for the studies in the subsequent sections .",
    "we also briefly summarize the procedure to calculate the @xmath0 distortion . then in section  [ sec : const ] , we present our results on the constraints on mixed source models implied by current cmb data and compute the predictions for the @xmath0 distortion in terms of the model parameters .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary and conclusions .",
    "let us consider a model with two sources of density fluctuations with different scale dependences . in general ,",
    "when there are two sources of density fluctuations , the primordial power spectrum can be given as their sum : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the amplitude of fluctuations for the source 1 and 2 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are the spectral indices for each source , while @xmath15 is the reference wave number at which the amplitude and the spectral index are measured .",
    "unless otherwise stated , in this paper we take @xmath16 . to represent the relative amplitude between these two power spectra",
    ", we define @xmath17 which is evaluated at the reference scale .",
    "the specific model we have in mind is the mixed inflaton and spectator model . there",
    "the power spectrum is sourced by both the inflaton @xmath18 and the spectator field @xmath19 .",
    "the primordial power spectrum due to the inflaton is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a slow - roll parameter defined below ( see eq .  ) , @xmath22 is the hubble parameter during inflation and @xmath23 is the reduced planck energy scale .",
    "if we assume that the spectator field @xmath19 is the curvaton , the power spectrum can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 roughly denotes the energy fraction of the curvaton to the total one at its decay , which is defined by @xmath26 while @xmath27 denotes the value of @xmath19 at the time of horizon exit .",
    "the spectral indices of the power spectra for the inflaton and the curvaton can respectively be written as @xcite is valid for any isocurvature field during inflation . ]",
    "@xmath28 in the above formulas , the slow - roll parameters are defined by @xmath29 with a dot representing the time derivative , @xmath30 and @xmath31 being @xmath32 , @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the tensor power spectrum is given as in the standard case by @xmath34 the tensor spectral index can be written as @xmath35 .    to discuss the size of the tensor mode",
    ", one usually uses the tensor - to - scalar ratio which for the mixed model is given as @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the measure of the contribution of the spectator , which has been defined in eq .  .",
    "when one compares the mixed model with cosmological observations such as cmb , one needs to calculate cmb angular power spectra for each primordial power spectrum separately , and then add those contributions .",
    "however , when the scale dependences of the two power spectra are not that much different , which is usually the case , we can define an  effective \" spectral index for the summed power spectrum as @xmath38 then we can regard the sum of the power spectra as if it were a single spectrum with the above effective spectral index , and compare directly with observations . however , it should be noted that when the scale dependences of the two spectra are very different , this description is not valid .",
    "one then has to calculate the cmb power spectra separately and add them together , whence the constraints on the mixed models turn out to be quite non - trivial .",
    "we will investigate this case in section [ sec : const ] .    in closing this section ,",
    "let us comment on the running of the spectral indices . in general , the running is non - zero and such running may affect the power spectra considerably , in particular on small scales .",
    "however , since we focus on mixed source models of primordial fluctuations , the effect of the running would be subdominant as compared to that of the mixed - source nature .",
    "this should remain a good approximation especially for the setups to be discussed in the following sections .      in this subsection ,",
    "let us summarize the formalism to calculate the cmb @xmath0 distortion due to the energy dissipation generated by the acoustic waves , particularly from the viewpoint of constraining the primordial power spectrum .",
    "we just give here some key formulas . for details , we refer the readers to @xcite .",
    "we basically follow the argument of @xcite .    when there is an energy injection @xmath39 , the distribution function of photon can deviate from the black body form .",
    "although such a deviation can be characterized by several types of distortions such as @xmath40- and @xmath41-types @xcite , here we focus on the @xmath0-type distortion .    for any given model , the spectral distortion can in principle be obtained numerically as a function of the model parameters .",
    "given the energy injection @xmath39 , @xmath0 can be calculated by @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the energy density of photon and @xmath44 is the double compton time scale : @xmath45 @xmath46 represents the helium abundance , @xmath47 is baryon density parameter and @xmath48 is the redshift . since here we consider the energy injection due to the dissipation of the acoustic waves , @xmath39 is given by @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 being density fluctuations and velocity of photons , and @xmath52 being the sound speed of photon fluid . by using the transfer functions for @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ", one can relate the energy injection @xmath39 with the primordial power spectrum of photon @xmath53 as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 is the diffusion length , which is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the hubble parameter , @xmath59 is the number density of free electron , @xmath60 is the thomson scattering cross section and @xmath61 .",
    "since the primordial ( curvature ) power spectrum @xmath62 is related to the photon power spectrum @xmath63 as @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 being the fraction of the neutrino energy density , the dissipation energy can be given once we specify the primordial power spectrum .",
    "( we also need to specify some cosmological parameters such as the baryon density , the helium abundance and so on ; however the dependence of @xmath0 on those parameters is very weak . ) by inserting all this information into eq .   and",
    "integrating , we obtain @xmath67 where @xmath68 represents the redshift of the time scale for the double compton scattering .",
    "the generation of the @xmath0 distortion is effective during when @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which set the upper and lower bounds of the integral . by using the power spectrum given in eq .",
    ", we can calculate the @xmath0 distortion for any parameter choice of the mixed inflaton and spectator field model .",
    "note that the @xmath0 distortion does not depend on any additional parameters ( except weak dependences on some parameters mentioned above ) but is determined completely by the primordial spectra .",
    "current bound on the @xmath0 distortion is @xmath72 , which has been obtained from cobe firas @xcite @xcite . ] .",
    "however , in the future , the sensitivity to @xmath0 will be much improved .",
    "future observations such as pixie and prism are expected to probe the distortion at the level of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the current cmb constraints on a mixed model combined with the predictions for the @xmath0 distortion . to obtain observational constraints from cmb",
    ", we adopt the data from planck @xcite , bkp ( joint analysis of bicep2/keck and planck ) @xcite and cmb high @xmath75 data from atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite .",
    "we perform markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis with a modified version of cosmomc code @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on constraints on the parameters describing primordial density fluctuations . from the point of view of the analysis , the simplest way to describe the primordial power spectra for",
    "the mixed models would be to use the amplitudes of the two power spectra @xmath11 and @xmath76 ( or @xmath11 and the ratio @xmath77 ) and their spectral indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 at the given reference scale . on the other hand , from a theoretical view point",
    ", it may be useful to see the constraints on the slow - roll parameters ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "thus , in presenting our results , we show the constraints for both of these parametrizations , which we describe in detail below .",
    "we note that the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath79 is also varied unless otherwise stated .",
    "in addition to the parameters characterizing the primordial power spectra , we also vary the standard cosmological parameters : baryon energy density @xmath80 , dark matter energy density @xmath81 , the acoustic peak scale @xmath82 and reionization optical depth @xmath83 .",
    "our results are presented below .",
    "since we have performed analyses with several setups , in which the treatments of the parameters differ , we display our results for each case separately .    * ( i ) standard case ( pure inflaton case ) *    first we show the results for the standard case where primordial fluctuations are generated solely from the inflaton , i.e. @xmath84 . although the @xmath0 distortion for the standard case has already been investigated in detail , including the running of the spectral index , in refs .",
    "@xcite , we show here the results for the benefit of comparison with the mixed model to be discussed subsequently . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_r_inf ] , we display the constraint from current cmb data and a scatter plot of the predicted value for @xmath0 in the @xmath85@xmath79 plane on the left and right panels , respectively .",
    "cmb constraints are shown from the analysis employing planck alone ( green region ) , planck+high @xmath75 data ( gray region ) , planck+bkp ( red region ) and planck+bkp+high @xmath75 data ( blue region ) .",
    "1@xmath19 and 2@xmath19 allowed regions are given with dark and light colors .",
    "although we show a scatter plot of @xmath0 in the @xmath85@xmath79 plane , to calculate the value of @xmath0 , we also need to fix the amplitude @xmath86 .",
    "however , the amplitude is well determined by cmb observations , and thus it can be regarded as almost fixed .",
    "once the amplitude is fixed , the value of @xmath0 can be evaluated just by giving the spectral index @xmath85 distortion @xcite .",
    "however , the distortion can be comparable to the one generated by the scalar mode only when the tensor spectral index is blue - tilted @xcite .",
    "therefore here we neglect such a contribution and hence the tensor - to - scalar ratio is here irrelevant for calculating the value of @xmath0 . ] .",
    "thus the region with larger @xmath0 corresponds to the one with larger @xmath85 , as seen from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_r_inf ] . in the standard inflation case ,",
    "given the current cmb constraints , @xmath0 typically takes a value @xmath87 , which may be detectable in the future observations such as pixie and prism .    *",
    "( ii ) general mixed model *    in this case , we vary the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath14 freely , which corresponds to the general two - source case . in general , the parameter @xmath37 which is related to the scalar - to - tensor ratio can take any value .",
    "however , @xmath37 and the spectral indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 are highly degenerate , which worsens the convergence of the mcmc chain . thus to avoid such a degeneracy , in our analysis",
    "we assume a finite prior range for @xmath37 as @xmath89 .",
    "the effect of this prior on the results are discussed below .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_r_mixed ] , we show respectively the cmb constraint and a scatter plot of @xmath0 for the case with a general mixed model on the left and right panels in the @xmath90@xmath79 plane , where @xmath90 is the effective spectral index defined in eq .  .",
    "it should be noted that we introduced @xmath91 just for illustrative purposes and the total power spectrum can not be described by a simple power - law form .",
    "as one can see from the right panel , in this kind of a mixed source model , the value of @xmath0 can be as large as @xmath92 ( or larger ) even inside the allowed region for certain parameter values .",
    "notice that , although @xmath90 should be around 0.96 , the spectral indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be respectively very blue - tilted when @xmath93 and @xmath94 .    to show that @xmath37 is scarcely constrained by the current cmb observations , we depict the cmb constraint on the @xmath21@xmath37 plane in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : eps_r_mixed ] . a scatter plot for the value of @xmath0 is also shown in the right panel .",
    "notice that the tensor - to - scalar ratio for the general mixed model is given by eq .  .",
    "since current observations just give an upper bound on @xmath79 , we can not obtain any bound on @xmath37 .",
    "regardless of the value of @xmath21 , a very large value of @xmath37 can be consistent with the current observational bounds on @xmath79 since the tensor - to - scalar ration is suppressed in this case .",
    "this also explains the fact that a broader range of @xmath21 is allowed in the large @xmath37 region .",
    "small values of @xmath37 are also acceptable since such cases simply reduce to the standard inflaton case .    to see which values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 would correlate with large values of @xmath0 , we also show our result in the @xmath13@xmath14 plane as well in fig .",
    "[ fig : ns1_ns2_mixed ] .",
    "we should note here that , although there seem to appear upper bounds on @xmath13 and @xmath14 , they depend on the prior for @xmath37 .",
    "as explained above , due to computational reasons , we adopted a prior for @xmath37 as @xmath89 .",
    "however , if we instead were to assume a broader range , for example , @xmath95 , the allowed region for the spectral indices would be broadened .",
    "one can see that the points with large values of @xmath0 lie in the region where either spectral index is very blue - tilted .",
    "* ( iii ) mixed models with @xmath96 *    in many cases , the mass of the spectator field is assumed to be very light as compared to the inflationary hubble scale , whence @xmath97 should be very small .",
    "therefore , here we consider such a situation by fixing @xmath96 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps_r_eta0 ] , we show the cmb constraints and the value of @xmath0 in the same manner of fig .",
    "[ fig : eps_r_mixed ] .",
    "although it seems that there is an upper bound on @xmath37 in this case , some caution is necessary when interpreting this result .",
    "since @xmath98 is fixed , the spectral index for the spectator @xmath14 is given by @xmath99 .",
    "when @xmath37 is large , the power spectrum is dominated by the contribution from @xmath100 , and @xmath14 should be close to @xmath101 ( roughly the mean value from planck result @xcite ) .",
    "this fixes the value of @xmath21 as @xmath102 .",
    "when @xmath21 is fixed , @xmath79 and @xmath37 are related by eq .   as @xmath103 , which indicates that @xmath79 should be very small when @xmath37 is large .",
    "in particular , when @xmath104 , which is the upper edge of the prior on @xmath37 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio should be small as @xmath105 .",
    "the region with such a small value of @xmath79 tends to be difficult to be sampled in the mcmc chain , hence most samples in the chain lie in the region with @xmath106 . for this reason ,",
    "the region with @xmath106 seems to be favored .",
    "however , this can be considered as a volume effect in the mcmc analysis .",
    "therefore the upper bound on @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps_r_eta0 ] should be interpreted with some caution .    in any case",
    ", in the region with large @xmath37 , the spectrum @xmath107 should be subdominant on the cmb scale and very blue - tilted spectrum can be admissible , which would give large power on small scale .",
    "thus , relatively large value of @xmath0 can be obtained in the large @xmath37 region .",
    "on the other hand , since in the small @xmath37 region , the tensor - to - scalar ratio is given by the standard formula @xmath108 , the constraint on @xmath109 indicates @xmath110 , which can also be seen from fig .",

    "( iv ) mixed models with @xmath111 *    in certain particle physics motivated models of inflation the @xmath112 parameter can turn out to be too large to be consistent with the observed scale - dependence of the power spectrum .",

    "[ fig : eps_r_eta_0_02 ] .",
    "when @xmath114 is positive and large , the spectral index for @xmath107 becomes highly blue - tilted , which enhances the power on small scales and gives rise to a large value of @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig : eps_r_eta_0_02 ] . especially in the allowed region with lower @xmath37 , a relatively large value of @xmath0 tends to be generated because of the large amplitude of @xmath107 with the blue - tilted spectrum .",

    "[ fig:1d_mu ] we show the 1d posterior predictive distribution of @xmath0 for the cases considered above .",
    "since we have evaluated the value of @xmath0 for each sample ( or cosmological parameter set ) using the mcmc chains , in a sense we may view @xmath0 as a  derived \" parameter .",
    "thus we can calculate the distribution of @xmath0 for each mcmc chain , which can be considered as yielding the  probable \" or ",
    "typical \" value of @xmath0 , given the current observational constraints .    from fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_mu ] , one can see that the standard single - field inflaton model typically predicts @xmath87 with a relatively narrow distribution .",
    "the expectation is that such values of @xmath0 would be detectable in future experiments . for the mixed model ,",
    "the distribution is much broader , and the central value is slightly larger than the one in the standard inflation case .",
    "this is because the spectral index @xmath13 for the inflaton fluctuations is less constrained within the framework of a mixed model ; the spectral index can be either very blue - tilted or red - tilted .",
    "therefore , a mixed model could easily give rise to a value of @xmath0 that is larger by almost an order of magnitude and therefore would be easily detectable .",
    "when in our example ( iv ) we assume @xmath127 , the spectral index @xmath13 is inevitably blue - tilted .",
    "thus the small scale power is enhanced to generate large values of @xmath0 , which gives a distribution of @xmath0 that is shifted to larger values as compared to the other cases , as can be seen in fig .",

    "therefore we could conclude that if a large @xmath0 is found in future observations , this kind of a particle physics motivated model could become an interesting candidate for the origin of the density fluctuations .",
    "as current cosmological observations impose severe constraints on the spectral index @xmath85 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath79 , many single - field inflation models have either been excluded or are on the verge of exclusion . in particular , as the sensitivies improve , a future stringent upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio may motivate us to take mixed inflaton and spectator field models seriously for the simple reason that @xmath79 tends to be naturally suppressed in such models ( of course , there are also inflaton models with low @xmath79 ) .    in mixed models",
    "the inflaton and a spectator field can be both responsible for the primordial perturbation so that there are two separate sources , @xmath107and @xmath100 , for the density fluctuations .",
    "we have argued that such models could soon be tested , and differentiated from the single - field inflaton models , by combining the observations on the cmb anisotropies with the data on the @xmath0 distortion of the cmb .    in the present paper , we have investigated in detail the constraints on such models from the current cmb observations by adopting an mcmc analysis .",
    "we note that since it is possible that @xmath107 gives the dominant contribution to the large scale fluctuations while @xmath100 contributes to the small scales , or vice versa , a very blue - tilted spectral index for the power spectrum subdominant on cmb scales could be allowed for .",
    "we also point out that such possibilities could easily be ruled out in future determinations of the @xmath0 distortion in experiments such as pixie and prism , which are expected to be able to detect @xmath0 distortion at the level of @xmath128 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_mu ] we demonstrate that the standard single - field inflaton model typically predicts @xmath87 with a relatively narrow distribution , whereas in mixed models the distribution can be very broad .",
    "indeed , a mixed model could easily give rise to @xmath129 and be thereby easily distinguishable from the single - field inflaton case .",
    "in addition to the general mixed model , we also analyzed certain specific representative cases by fixing the values of @xmath114 and/or @xmath97 .",
    "for example , in some inflationary models @xmath112 can be large with @xmath130(0.1 ) , which in the standard single - field inflation is not admissible because the spectral index becomes either too red - tilted or too blue - tilted .",
    "however , in mixed models , such a possibility can be realized provided the scalar field with large @xmath112 does not affect large scale density fluctuations , which could be sourced mainly by the other scalar . in the future",
    ", such models can be confronted with the small scale observations of the @xmath0 distortion .    our study , while remaining incomplete in that we do not perform a systematic survey of all possible models",
    ", nevertheless suggests that one should check the spectral predictions of a given model over a large range of scales . in this regard",
    "the @xmath0 distortion appears to provide a promising new tool for testing critically models of the primordial perturbation .",

    "<S> we find the posterior distribution of @xmath0 using mcmc chains and demonstrate that the standard single - field inflaton model typically predicts @xmath1 with a relatively narrow distribution , whereas for the mixed models , the distribution turns out to be much broader , and @xmath0 could be larger by almost an order of magnitude . hence future experiments of @xmath0 distortion could provide a tool for the critical testing of the mixed source models of the primordial perturbation .    </S>",
