    "network science has provided a large body of theoretical tools to investigate complex systems , from physics to social sciences and biology @xcite .",
    "much work has been devoted to the study of networks topological properties @xcite and dynamical processes on networks have been shown to depend sensitively on the network structure @xcite .",
    "more recently , the response of networks to external perturbations has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "most of the networks found in nature are scale - free , characterized by a power - law degree distribution and by the presence of nodes whose degree greatly exceeds the average @xcite .",
    "these special nodes , referred to as network hubs , are crucial for the structural integrity of many real - world systems @xcite , allowing for a fault tolerance behavior against random failures @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if the hubs are removed from the network by an intentional attack , the network might fragment into a set of isolated graphs .",
    "thus , the presence of hubs represents at the same time the robustness and the ` achilles heel ' of scale - free networks .",
    "this property has been extensively studied by means of percolation theory @xcite .",
    "in addition , network hubs can be detected and studied using numerous different graph measures , most of which express aspects of node centrality @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the two - states voter model subjected to external perturbations in star networks and compare the results with those obtained for fully connected systems . the star and fully connected topologies model two extreme scenarios , corresponding to the presence of a single network hub and the total absence of preferentially connected nodes , respectively .",
    "the perturbations represent opinion makers , who have already decided who to vote for and whose influence extents over the entire population .",
    "they are modeled by a set of external nodes whose states are fixed and that connect to all nodes of the network . the system exhibits a phase transition from disordered to ordered states as the external perturbation is decreased and can be characterized by the equilibrium probability distribution of finding @xmath0 nodes in a given state .",
    "we show that the shape of this distribution is very similar for star and fully connected networks away from the phase transition , but it shows a fingerprint of the network topology close to the critical point . for fully connected networks the probability distribution is uniform at the critical point , whereas for star networks it splits in two peaks , reflecting the two possible states of the central node . for single realizations of the dynamics and weak perturbations the state of the network oscillates according to the equilibrium distribution .",
    "we show that the time scale of these oscillations is sensitive to the network topology , being much faster for the star network .",
    "we derive approximate analytical solutions for the star network and extend the results for multiple stars , which can be used as a simplified model for a scale - free network .    in the next two sections we describe the voter model with opinion makers and the implementation of the dynamics in a general network .",
    "exact results for the fully connected network are reviewed in section [ fullynet ] and in section [ starnet ] we obtain the master equations for star networks and show results from numerical simulations .",
    "we also generalize our calculations to star networks whose center contains a group of fully connected nodes , and construct an approximate solution for the joint effect of two network hubs , which is further compared with the outcome of a scale - free network .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the voter model consists of a set of individuals trying to decide in which of two candidates to vote for @xcite .",
    "their opinion can be influenced by their friends , represented by a network of social contacts , and by opinion makers , such as journalists or politicians , whose power of persuasion toward one of the candidates extents over the entire population .",
    "the opinion makers are modeled by external frozen nodes whose states never change and that reach all voters equally , acting as perturbations to the network dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the intention of a voter is quantified by its state being 0 or 1 and the number of opinion makers for candidates 0 and 1 are @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . at each time",
    "step a voter is selected at random and its state is updated : the voter can retain its opinion or adopt the opinion of one of its connected neighbors , which can be a friend or an opinion maker . in the absence of opinion makers",
    "the population eventually reaches a consensus and the network stabilizes with all nodes 0 or all nodes 1 , which are the only absorbing configurations . as long as opinion makers are present for both candidates the network never stabilizes , but it does reach a statistical equilibrium where the probability that candidate 1 has a given number of votes becomes independent of the time .",
    "this dynamical process can model other interesting systems besides as an election with two candidates @xcite , such as a population of sexually reproducing ( haploid ) organisms @xcite and herding behavior in social systems @xcite .",
    "it is also similar to the glauber dynamics of the ising model @xcite where @xmath4 is analogous to the temperature and @xmath5 to an external magnetic field .    if the number of opinion makers is zero the average time to reach consensus can be analytically calculated in terms of the moments of the network degree distribution @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of external perturbations complicates the dynamics and solutions have been obtained only for simple networks and specific distribution of frozen nodes . in particular , the voter model without opinion makers was studied in regular lattices where one individual in the population has fixed opinion ( a zealot ) @xcite .",
    "analytic solutions were also obtained for the equilibrium distribution in fully connected networks with arbitrary number of opinion makers in the limit where the number of voters goes to infinity @xcite .",
    "the full dynamical problem with finite number of voters was finally solved in @xcite where it was shown that the solution was also a good approximation for networks of different topologies , as long as the number of opinion makers @xmath2 and @xmath3 were rescaled according to the average degree of the network ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 were also analytically extended to real numbers smaller than 1 , representing weak coupling between the voters and the opinion makers . it was shown",
    "( see also @xcite ) that a phase transition exists between ordered states , where most voters have the same opinion , to a disordered state , where approximately half the votes go to each candidate , as @xmath2 and @xmath3 go from very small to very large numbers .",
    "the transition occurs exactly at @xmath6 for fully connected networks of any size . here",
    "we study this phase transition in the star network .",
    "consider a network with @xmath7 nodes specified by the adjacency matrix @xmath8 , defined by @xmath9 if nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 are connected and @xmath12 otherwise . for our purpose , @xmath13 ( nodes do not connect to themselves ) , and for any pair of nodes it is possible to construct a path connecting them .",
    "each node has an internal state which can take only the values @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the nodes are also connected to @xmath2 external nodes whose states are fixed at 0 and to @xmath3 nodes whose states are fixed at 1 , as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] . in order to distinguish between the two kinds of nodes , we call the @xmath4 external nodes _ fixed _ and the @xmath7 nodes of the network , whose states are variable , _ free_. following @xcite we shall treat @xmath2 and @xmath3 as real numbers , representing weighted coupling between the opinion makers and the voters",
    ".    the free nodes can change their internal state according to the following dynamical rule : at each time step a free node is selected at random and , with probability @xmath16 its state remains the same ; with probability @xmath17 the node copies the state of one of its connected neighbors , free or fixed , also chosen at random .        let @xmath18 denote a _ microscopic _ state of the network with @xmath19 or @xmath20 representing the state of node @xmath10 .",
    "there is a total of @xmath21 possible microscopic states and we call @xmath22 the probability of finding the network in the state @xmath23 at time @xmath1 .",
    "since a single free node can change state per time step , it is useful to define the auxiliary state @xmath24 which is identical to @xmath23 at every node except at node @xmath25 , whose state is the opposite of @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath28 with these definitions , the evolution equation for the probabilities can be written as @xmath29 the first two terms take into account the probability that the network is already in state @xmath23 and the selected node ( i ) does not change its state or ( ii ) copies the state of a neighbor which is identical to its own state .",
    "the last term is the probability that the network is in a state differing from @xmath23 by a single node , which is selected and copies the state of neighbor opposite to its own .    according to the dynamical rules ,",
    "the transition probabilities can be written as @xmath30 is the degree of the node @xmath10 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath31 we find that the two transition probabilities are identical and obtain @xmath32}{k_i+n_0+n_1 } \\left[\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij } |1-x_i - x_j| + x_i n_1 + ( 1-x_i ) n_0\\right]}. \\end{array } \\label{geneq}\\ ] ]",
    "for networks that are fully connected the nodes are indistinguishable and the state of the network is fully specified by the number @xmath0 of nodes with internal state 1 @xcite .",
    "each of these _ macroscopic _ states corresponds to a set of @xmath33 $ ] degenerated microscopic network states . because there are only @xmath34 macroscopic states equations ( [ geneq ] ) are greatly simplified .",
    "the equilibrium probability @xmath35 of finding the network with @xmath0 nodes in state 1 is given by the beta - binomial distribution @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 this expression can also be written in term of @xmath38 .",
    "in the limit @xmath39 , @xmath40 becomes a continuous variable @xmath41 and @xmath42 converges to the beta distribution @xcite @xmath43 the interesting feature of the solution expressed by eq.([probn ] ) is that for @xmath6 it gives @xmath44 , meaning that all states are equally likely , as illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] .    for networks of different topologies the effect of the fixed nodes is amplified .",
    "the probability that a free node copies a fixed node is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the degree of the node . for fully connected networks @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for general networks",
    "an average value @xmath49 can be calculated by replacing @xmath46 by the average degree .",
    "effective numbers of fixed nodes @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be then defined as the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in @xmath52 for which @xmath53 .",
    "this leads to @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that eq.([probn ] ) with the above rescaling of fixed nodes fits very well the probability distribution for a variety of topologies .",
    "the formula was tested for relatively small networks of the types random , 2-d regular lattice , barabasi - albert scale - free and small world .",
    "similar results were obtained in the context of herding behavior of economic agents @xcite .",
    "for a star network it is convenient to set the total number of nodes to @xmath34 .",

    "the transition between nearly consensus ( ordered state ) and a tie ( disordered state ) takes place exactly at @xmath6 , independently of the population size @xmath7 . for networks with average degree",
    "@xmath153 the effect of the fixed nodes is amplified by a factor @xmath55 , which can be very large for natural populations .",
    "much above or much below the transition from disordered to ordered states the influence of the network structure is negligible and only shows up in the rescaling of the opinion makers influence , that is large when the network is weakly connected .",
    "this is in contrast with processes describing the spreading of epidemics or synchronization of oscillators , where the topology plays a crucial role @xcite .",
    "close to the critical point , however , the network structure can leave signatures in the probability distribution @xmath154 .    for the particular case of star networks with a single central node , the gaussian - like distribution displayed by @xmath155 for large values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 splits into two peaks centered at @xmath156 and @xmath157 reflecting the state of the central node being 1 or 0 .",
    "the central node controls the entire system and the distribution behaves approximately as a single giant node with two collective states only . for @xmath6",
    "the peaks are centered at @xmath158 and @xmath159 respectively , which is rather different from the distribution of fully connected networks where @xmath44 is constant . in the former case",
    "the election will be won by one of the candidates with approximately @xmath160 of the votes , whereas in the latter , the winner can have any number of votes with equal probability . for small values of @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "both star and fully connected networks are likely to be found in ordered states , where most nodes are in state 0 or in state 1 .",
    "these states , however , are not stable and network oscillates between the two possibilities .",
    "we found that the average frequency of these oscillations are much higher for star networks than for fully connected ones .",
    "when a few weakly connected hubs are present , the effects of central nodes are still visible , as shown by fig.[fig6](b ) . however",
    ", when the system is controlled by multiple hubs , as in a general scale - free network , the collective behavior becomes again similar to that predicted by the mean field approximation and the control by ` local leaders ' becomes much less relevant . in these cases eqs.([probn ] ) and ( [ eq : rescaling ] ) provide good approximations for the equilibrium probability .    as a final remark we note that fully connected and stars with arbitrary number of central nodes seem to be the only network topologies where a simple treatment via macroscopic master equations similar to ( [ eqr])-([eqs ] ) is possible . even the highly symmetric ring network ( 1-d lattice with periodic boundary conditions )",
    "does not behave as if all nodes were identical , since different configuration having the same number of nodes at the state 1 give rise to different macroscopic states .",

    "c.a.m . was supported by capes .",
    "the approximation ( [ prob_tot ] ) completely discards the fact that the state of the central node fluctuates and fails to describe the region between the two peaks .",
    "here we derive a better approximation using phenomenological ideas .",
    "we first define @xmath161 as the equivalent of ( [ nu1 ] ) and ( [ nu0 ] ) for the case where the state of the central node is in the average state @xmath23 with @xmath41 .",
    "accordingly , we define @xmath162 as the probability of finding @xmath0 nodes in state 1 , including the central the peripheral nodes ( see eqs .",
    "( [ prob_s ] ) and ( [ prob_r ] ) ) .",
    "if @xmath163 is the probability distribution that the central node is in state @xmath23 , then @xmath164 for @xmath165 we recover the approximation ( [ prob_tot ] ) .    in order to obtain better results we need to consider smoother distributions and the natural functional dependence for @xmath163 is the continuous version of @xmath42 , the beta distribution eq.([probbetax ] ) : @xmath166 here @xmath167 and @xmath168 measure the joint effect of the external perturbations , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and of the @xmath169 peripheral nodes on the central node .",
    "because the approximation with the delta functions ( [ cx0 ] ) already gives a good description of the exact distribution , @xmath170 and @xmath110 should be significant only close to the phase transition .",
    "the choice @xmath171 turns out to work well for all the cases tested .    for the case of two central nodes ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) a similar procedure can be divised .",
    "we set @xmath172 with @xmath23 and @xmath173 representing the states of the two central nodes .",
    "the probability that @xmath0 nodes are in state 1 becomes @xmath174 so that @xmath175 the probability distribution that the two central nodes are in states @xmath23 and @xmath173 must reproduce the coefficients @xmath176 in eq.([prob_totg ] ) . using the analogy between eqs .",
    "( [ prob_tot ] ) and ( [ cx0 ] ) it can be checked that the appropriate function is @xmath177 indeed , using the approximation ( [ cx0 ] ) for @xmath178 we see that @xmath179 + n_1(n_1 + 1 ) \\delta(1-x ) \\delta(1-y ) \\right\\ } \\end{array}\\ ] ] whose coefficients correspond to @xmath176 .",
    "we remark that the integrals ( [ probx0 ] ) and ( [ probxy0 ] ) might be difficult to evaluate numerically for very small values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , since the beta distribution becomes very large close to @xmath180 and @xmath181 . in this limit , however , the distribution is peaked close to @xmath67 and @xmath68 and the approximation provided by the fully connected distribution should work well ."
