    "the significant surge in demand for high data rate wireless applications and the unprecedented growth in the number of wireless users have led to larger amount of bandwidth being required for wireless transmissions and increased the energy consumption levels . on the other hand , high energy prices , limited battery power ,",
    "increasing greenhouse gas emissions have led to the emerging trend of addressing the optimal and intelligent usage of energy resources .",
    "hence , energy - efficient operation is a major consideration in wireless systems .",
    "in addition , bandwidth is generally a scarce resource in wireless communications .",
    "although the available radio - frequency ( rf ) spectrum has already been allocated / licensed to various applications and services , the allocated spectrum is underutilized most of the time according to the federal communication commission ( fcc ) s report @xcite .",
    "this inefficiency in the spectrum usage has led to the consideration of the new communication paradigm of cognitive radio @xcite , @xcite . in cognitive radio systems ,",
    "the unlicensed users ( cognitive or secondary users ) are able to opportunistically access the frequency bands allocated to the licensed users ( primary users ) as long as the interference inflicted on the primary users transmissions is limited . in this",
    "regard , cognitive radio enables better and more efficient utilization of the spectrum .    the energy efficiency ( ee ) of cognitive radio systems has been recently studied .",
    "for instance , the authors in @xcite highlight the benefits of cognitive radio systems for green wireless communications .",
    "the authors in @xcite design energy efficient optimal sensing strategy and optimal sequential sensing order in multichannel cognitive radio networks .",
    "in addition , the sensing time and transmission duration are jointly optimized in @xcite . in the ee analysis of the aforementioned works ,",
    "secondary users are assumed to transmit only when the channel is sensed as idle .",
    "the recent work in @xcite mainly focuses on optimal power allocation to achieve the maximum energy efficiency in ofdm - based cognitive radio networks .",
    "also , energy efficient optimal power allocation in cognitive mimo broadcast channels is studied in @xcite . in these works",
    ", secondary users always share the spectrum with primary users without performing channel sensing .    in order to further increase secondary users transmission opportunities , unlike above works ,",
    "in this study we consider the transmission strategy of sensing - based spectrum sharing and assume that the secondary users can coexist with the primary users in the presence of both idle and busy sensing decisions while adapting their transmission power according to the sensing result .",
    "for such a model , we first formulate ee maximization problem subject to peak / average transmit power constraints and average interference constraints in the presence of imperfect sensing results .",
    "we explicitly consider circuit power consumption in the total power expenditure .",
    "in addition , due to imperfect sensing results , we model the additive disturbance as gaussian mixture distributed and formulate the achievable rates of the cognitive radio systems accordingly .",
    "the ee maximization problem is transformed into an equivalent concave form and dinkelbach s method - based power allocation algorithm is proposed .",
    "we provide numerical results to illustrate the effects of imperfect sensing decisions and transmit / interference power constraints on the energy efficiency .",
    "we assume that the secondary users initially perform channel sensing in the first @xmath0 symbols of the frame duration of @xmath1 symbols .",
    "hence , data transmission is performed in the remaining @xmath2 symbols .",
    "spectrum sensing can be formulated as a hypothesis testing problem in which there are two hypotheses based on whether primary users are active or inactive over the channel , denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "many spectrum sensing methods have been studied in the literature ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , including matched filter detection , energy detection and cyclostationary feature detection .",
    "each method has its own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "however all sensing methods are inevitably subject to errors in the form of false alarms and miss detections due to low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of primary users , noise uncertainty , multipath fading and shadowing of wireless channels .",
    "hence , we consider that spectrum sensing is performed with possible errors .",
    "the sensing reliability is characterized via only detection and false alarm probabilities .",
    "therefore , any sensing method is applicable in the rest of the analysis .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the sensing decisions that the channel is busy ( i.e. , is occupied by the primary users ) and idle , respectively .",
    "hence , by conditioning on the true hypotheses , the detection and false - alarm probabilities are defined , respectively as follows : @xmath7 the rest of the conditional probabilities of idle sensing decision given the true hypotheses can be obtained as @xmath8      after performing channel sensing , the secondary users initiate data transmission . the channel is considered to be block flat - fading in which the fading coefficients stay the same during a frame duration and vary independently in the following frame .",
    "secondary users are assumed to transmit under both idle and busy sensing decisions .",
    "therefore , as a combination of the true nature of primary user activity and channel sensing decisions , the four possible channel input - output relations between the secondary transmitter - receiver pair can be expressed as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 . above , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transmitted and received signals , respectively and @xmath13 is the channel fading coefficient between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver distributed according to a gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the additive noise and the primary users received faded signal .",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are assumed to be independent and identically distributed circularly - symmetric , zero - mean gaussian sequences with variances @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the transmission power levels of the secondary users .",
    "more specifically , the average power level is @xmath23 if the channel is detected to be idle while it is @xmath24 if the channel is detected to be busy .    under these assumptions , the received signal @xmath12 conditionally given sensing decisions has a gaussian mixture distribution .",
    "in this setting , a closed - form capacity expression is not available . by replacing the conditional distributions with a gaussian distribution with the same corresponding variance , the following achievable rate ( in bits per second )",
    "is obtained @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes expectation operation with respect to the fading coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "the energy efficiency ( ee ) metric we adopt is the ratio of the achievable rate to the total power consumption ( in bits per joule ) defined more explicitly as follows : @xmath27 above , the total consumed power consists of average transmission power and circuit power , denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "circuit power represents the average power consumption of the transmitter circuitry ( i.e. , mixers , filters , and digital - to - analog converters , etc . ) , which is independent of the transmission power .",
    "also , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the probabilities of channel being detected as busy and idle , respectively , which can further be expressed as @xmath31    the achievable ee expression in ( [ eq : achievable_ee ] ) can serve as an lower bound since the lower bound on achievable rate @xmath32 in ( [ eq : lower_bound_r ] ) is employed .",
    "the usefulness of this ee expression is due to its being an explicit function of the sensing performance .     vs. achievable rate @xmath32 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ee_se ] , we plot the achievable ee expression in ( [ eq : achievable_ee ] ) ( indicated as the lower bound ) and the exact achievable ee as a function of the achievable rate for both perfect sensing ( i.e. , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) and imperfect sensing ( i.e. , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "in order to evaluate the exact achievable ee with gaussian input , we performed monte carlo simulations with @xmath37 samples . in the case of perfect",
    "sensing , the lower bound and simulation result perfectly match as expected since in this case additive disturbance has gaussian distribution rather than a gaussian mixture . in the case of",
    "imperfect sensing , the lower bound is tight when the difference between noise variance and variance of primary users is small , e.g. , when @xmath38 or @xmath39 , @xmath40 . when the difference in the variances is large , e.g. , when @xmath41 , @xmath40 , the gap between the lower bound and the exact ee increases .",
    "however , it is seen that achievable ee expressions in ( [ eq : achievable_ee ] ) is still a good lower bound .",
    "since circuit power is taken into consideration and we assume @xmath42 , achievable ee vs. achievable rate curve has a bell shape and also is quasiconcave .",
    "it is further observed that the maximum ee is attained at nearly the same achievable rate for both lower bound and exact ee expressions .    in the following section ,",
    "we derive the power adaptation schemes that maximize ee of cognitive radio systems in the presence of sensing errors subject to different combinations of transmit power and interference power constraints .",
    "the maximum ee under both average transmit power and interference power constraints can be found by solving the following optimization problem    @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the maximum average transmission power of the secondary transmitter and @xmath45 represents the maximum average interference power at the primary receiver .",
    "also , @xmath46 denotes the channel fading coefficient between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver and the expectations above are taken with respect to both @xmath46 and @xmath13 .",
    "the above optimization problem is quasiconcave since the achievable rate @xmath32 is concave in transmission powers , and the total power consumption @xmath47 is both affine and positive .",
    "then , the level sets @xmath48 are convex for any @xmath49 .",
    "we employ an iterative power adaptation algorithm based on dinkelbach s method @xcite to solve the quasiconcave ee maximization problem by considering the equivalent parameterized concave problem as follows :    @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a nonnegative parameter . at the optimal value of @xmath53 , solving",
