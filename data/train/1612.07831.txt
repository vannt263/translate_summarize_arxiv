    "information about unique properties of arsco has been published quite recently @xcite and immediately excited much interest .",
    "this is a close binary with the orbital period of @xmath0h containing a red dwarf of spectral type m and a white dwarf spinning at the period of @xmath1s .",
    "the most peculiar feature of this object is that the spin period of the white dwarf is increasing so rapidly that its spin - down power exceeds the bolometric luminosity of the system emitting electromagnetic radiation from radio to x - rays .",
    "moreover , the white dwarf is a radio - pulsar as well as a pulsar in the ir , optical and uv spectral domains .",
    "the intensity of pulsed emission in the optical region exceeds the total emission of the stellar components .",
    "the spectrum of radio - emission is non - thermal and characterized by anomalously high brightness temperature . @xcite",
    "have concluded that the white dwarf in arsco is spin - powered and in the ejector state .    in spite of all unique properties ,",
    "arsco is not the only system containing a white dwarf in the ejector state , i.e. spending its rotation energy according to the canonical model of a radio - pulsar at a rate which exceeds the observed source luminosity .",
    "it shares this property with the white dwarf of aeaquarii ( aeaqr ) which is spinning at the period of 33s and exhibits a period derivative of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "its spin - down power under these conditions exceeds the bolometric luminosity of the system ( observed in the wide range from radio to x - rays ) and can be explained within the conventional spin - powered pulsar model provided the magnetic moment of the white dwarf is @xmath3 , which implies the surface magnetic field of @xmath4 mg @xcite .",
    "in the case of arsco the spin - down power can be inferred from observations as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the moment of inertia and the spin period of the white dwarf in units of @xmath8 and 117s , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", the spin - down power of a spin - powered pulsar with the angular velocity @xmath9 and dipole magnetic moment @xmath10 can be expressed following @xcite as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes .",
    "solving equation @xmath13 for @xmath10 and assuming @xmath14 one finds a lower limit to the dipole magnetic moment of the white dwarf in arsco within the spin - powered white dwarf scenario as @xmath15 this implies that the magnetic field strength at the equator of the white dwarf of mass @xmath16 and radius @xmath17 is @xmath18 where the moment of inertia of the white dwarf @xmath19 and the radius of gyration @xmath20 is normalized following @xcite .",
    "a possible formation of the ejector white dwarf in the process of binary evolution was considered in detail in a previous paper @xcite dedicated to the overview of peculiar properties and origin of aeaqr .",
    "the developed approach can be used here since the white dwarf in arsco is currently spinning down at the time - scale @xmath21yr , while its age determined by the cooling time is much longer . indeed , the cooling time of the white dwarf with the surface temperature @xmath22k and mass @xmath23 is @xmath24yr @xcite .",
    "a natural conclusion is that fast rotation of the white dwarf is not caused by the singularity of its birth but is a consequence of peculiar binary evolution incorporating the stage of rapid spin - up of the white dwarf due to high - rate accretion onto its surface .",
    "a white dwarf can undergo a significant accretion - driven spin - up only under condition @xmath25 , where @xmath26yr is a critical rate which provides a stable burning of hydrogen in the matter accreted onto its surface ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "otherwise , the situation would resemble the dwarf novae in which the angular momentum is effectively carried away from the white dwarf by the expanding envelope formed in the novae outburst due to thermonuclear runaways on its surface @xcite .",
    "for @xmath27 the duration of the spin - up stage is @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an initial spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "here @xmath30 is its magnetospheric radius , @xmath31 , at the end of the spin - up epoch expressed in @xmath32 cm , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .      in the process of accretion - driven spin - up",
    "the white dwarf could reach the period @xmath35 only if its magnetospheric radius at the final stage of the spin - up epoch , @xmath36 , did not exceed the corotation radius , i.e. @xmath37 , from which we estimate the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf at the end of the spin - up stage as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 this means that the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf should significantly vary in the course of arsco evolution .",
    "it decreased by a factor of @xmath40 during the spin - up epoch and returned to its initial value upon its completion .",
    "such evolution of the magnetic field could result from its screening by the accreting material @xcite .",
    "a possibility to bury the magnetic field of accreting compact objects was investigated for both the neutron stars @xcite and the white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "studies have shown that under favorable conditions the surface magnetic field of a star can decrease by a factor of 100 with its subsequent reemerging due to diffusion through the layer of accreted plasma .      following this approach",
    "we can outline the following scheme of the arsco evolution .",
    "prior to the stage of active mass transfer the magnetic field strength on the surface of the white dwarf in arsco was close to its current value and the mass exchange rate was @xmath41 . as the normal component overfilled its roche lobe , the mass exchange rate increased up to @xmath42 . this led to decrease of the magnetospheric radius of the white dwarf down to @xmath43 cm ( here @xmath44 ) and start of disk accretion onto its surface provided @xmath45 . the latter condition could be satisfied if the initial spin period of the white dwarf was @xmath46min .    due to the surface field of the white dwarf screening by plasma accumulating on its polar caps the magnetospheric radius of the white dwarf was further decreasing . at the final stages of spin - up",
    "epoch the magnetic field strength on the white dwarf surface did not exceed 10 mg , that allowed spin - up of the white dwarf to the current value of its rotation period .",
    "assuming that the magnetospheric radius of the white dwarf is decreasing at the same rate as its corotation radius , one can estimate the minimum possible spin - up time of the white dwarf with account for screening of its magnetic field in the process of accretion from equation @xmath47 as @xmath48 after the stage of active mass exchange is finished the magnetic field of the white dwarf is regenerating in the process of diffusion through the layer of degenerate matter .",
    "the timescale of this process can be evaluated following @xcite as @xmath49 for the magnetic field of the white dwarf to reemerge before its spin period can significantly increase we should require @xmath50 . substituting expression ( [ tau_diff ] ) and solving this inequality for @xmath51 we find for the parameters of arsco : @xmath52 taking into account that the amount of matter accumulated on the white dwarf surface during the spin - up stage can be estimated as @xmath53 and substituting ( [ delta_t_min ] ) , we can get upper limit for the moment of inertia of the white dwarf in arsco providing its evolution to be described in terms of accretion - driven spin - up : @xmath54 this condition is satisfied @xcite for any white dwarf of the mass in the range @xmath55 determined by @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the origin of arsco can be explained within the scenario in which the accretion - driven spin - up is accompanied by screening of the magnetic field of the accretor initially proposed for aeaqr ( for futher discussion see * ? ? ?",
