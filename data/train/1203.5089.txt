    "an estimate of the total number of young stars both with and without disks requires a method for identifying and counting diskless class iii objects .",
    "these pure photospheric sources can not be distinguished from background field stars by their near to mid - ir colors . in the following sub - sections , we use two separate methods to quantify the number of diskless class iii objects .",

    "for reference , within the region imaged by @xmath0 there are 36 class 0/i , 810 class ii , 29 transition disk and 3213 photospheric sources ( class iii or field stars ) as classified via @xmath12 and 2mass colors alone .",
    "thus , we are detecting @xmath71 of the class ii sources and @xmath72 of the transition disk sources with @xmath0 .",
    "we can also search for diskless young stars by utilizing the intrinsic magnitudes and colors of young stars to separate them from field stars in @xmath64 vs. @xmath73 space ( fig .",
    "[ fig_vis ] ) .",
    "young stars are still contracting to the ms , thus for a given temperature , young stars have a greater luminosity than field stars at an equal or greater distance .",

    "to determine the isochrone of young stars in the cluster , the locations of members identified by @xmath12 and @xmath0 are plotted in @xmath64 and @xmath65 space ( fig .",
    "[ fig_vis ] ) .",
    "the young stars are then divided into @xmath76 magnitude bins between @xmath64 magnitudes of 15 and 24 , and a two step iterative process is used to determine the median @xmath65 color of the known yso population in each bin .",

    "next outliers greater than @xmath77 from the median are rejected and a new median and standard deviation are calculated .",
    "the width of the yso isochrone in color space is then taken to be between @xmath78 and @xmath79 around the median color of the bin . the median color of the yso isochrone is fit with a third order polynomial , as are the outer bounds of the yso isochrone ; all stars between the two outer bounds are considered to be likely members .",
    "the lower bound of the isochrone is cropped closer to the median value because the density of sources quickly increases in the direction perpendicular to the isochrone in the direction toward the zams .",
    "in particular , foreground dwarfs and background giants may masquerade as ysos by appearing more luminous for a given color .",
    "the outer bounds are shown in fig  [ fig_vis ] .",
    "hereafter , this selection of sources will be denoted by the visible sample .",
    "we can estimate an upper bound to the possible non - member stellar contamination ( both foreground and background ) by considering the @xmath64 and @xmath74 photometry from field 3a from @xcite , hereafter called the pozzo field .",
    "this is a @xmath80 field centered on ra : 22:50:21.14 and dec : 62:46:44.88 , on the north - west of the molecular clump cep f. we choose this region due to its location off the cluster and because it has the least number of @xmath12 identified excess sources ; only four .",
    "if we assume that these four sources are the only sources in this field that are members of cep ob3b , then we can apply the same @xmath64 and @xmath65 selection criteria and consider all remaining sources that occupy the yso dominated region of color - magnitude space as contaminants .",
    "there are 98 sources that fit this criteria ( 102 sources in the yso dominated region , minus the 4 known excess sources ) , for a contamination rate of @xmath81 stars arcminute@xmath82 .",
    "another way to estimate the number of non - member stellar contaminants in the @xmath64 and @xmath73 space is to extrapolate from the number of sources in the region of @xmath64 and @xmath73 space below the yso isochrone into the yso isochrone . assuming that there is a constant stellar density along the line of sight , then the number of stars of a given magnitude , @xmath83 , is approximately @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "we approximate the yso isochrone with a linear strip in @xmath64 and @xmath73 space that is two magnitudes wide ( bounded by the lines @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , and consider the sources found in the one magnitude linear strip below the yso isochrone , bounded by the lines @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 to be non - member field stars",
    ". then the ratio of non - member field stars along the line of sight within the yso isochrone to the number of stars within the field star isochrone is just @xmath90 since there are 1211 sources in the one magnitude field star strip , we estimate 381 contaminants in the yso isochrone . dividing by the area covered by the visible data @xmath91 leads to a contamination rate of @xmath92 stars arcminute@xmath82 .",
    "this figure is similar to , but slightly lower than , the density of contamination derived from the pozzo field . because the pozzo field may contain some young sources due to its proximity to the molecular cloud , we adopt @xmath92 stars arcminute@xmath82 as the visible selection contamination rate .",
    "the visible sample includes : 402 class ii , 23 transition disk , and 1270 class iii sources , of which 381 may be contaminants .",
    "if we restrict the sample to only the sources that lie within the region with a field of view in common with the @xmath0 images ( we will call this region the overlap region ) , we find 372 class ii , 17 transition disk , and 914 class iii sources , with an estimated 232 contaminants .",
    "the entire population of identified young stars ( see fig .  [",

    "this is advantageous because the detectability of low - mass pre - main sequence stars in cep  ob3b by @xmath12 will be less affected by extinction and nebulosity than in the onc .",
    "the 56 protostars ( i.e. sources classified as class 0/i ) are primarily found in the vicinity of the cep b and cep f molecular clumps .",

    "tis shows that star formation is continuing in these clumps .",
    "the remaining 33 protostars apparently are not associated with high extinction , although this may be a short - coming in our extinction map because of its low spatial resolution , and the consequent bias against detecting compact high extinction structures .",
    "on the other hand , some of these protostars may be edge - on disks ; @xcite estimated that the number of edge - on disks is at most 3.5% of the total number of class  ii objects . in cep",
    "ob3b this upper limit corresponds to @xmath535 edge - on disk systems . since this number is comparable to the number of protostars in cep ob3b that are not associated with high extinction , most of these ysos classified as protostars may be edge - on disk systems .",
    "to estimate the disk fraction we require a census of the cluster members with and without disks . while the number of members with disks is reliably determined from our sample of ir excess sources , to determine the number of diskless members we require a method to distinguish between diskless class iii and field stars seen in projection toward the cluster",
    "this has often been done by using measurements of the source density in off - cluster regions to estimate the number of field stars ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) . however , these methods require assumptions about the homogeneity of the background distribution of stars and line of sight extinction that may not hold in a large , complex ob association with multiple epochs of star formation .",
    "thus , we use the direct identification of class iii members using either their x - ray flux or their position on the @xmath64 vs. @xmath65 diagram , as described in section  [ df_vis ] .    since disk sources are selected because of their increased flux in the infrared , sources with disks can be detected to fainter magnitudes , and higher extinctions , than purely photospheric sources . to reduce the impact of this bias",

    "we confirm that there is a higher disk fraction toward the cloud than toward hd 217086 , see @xmath41 @xmath150 and figures @xmath151 and @xmath152 .    to examine the possibility that an age difference could explain the difference in disk fraction between the two sub - clusters , we use the @xmath64 and @xmath74 data from @xcite of the @xmath12 and @xmath0 selected young sample .",
    "we divide the sample into two sets , one for each of the two @xmath153 radius sub - cluster regions defined above . fig .",
    "[ v_vmi_sub]a shows the location of these sources in @xmath64 vs. @xmath65 color - magnitude space .",
    "note , that the reddening vector in v vs. @xmath65 space is approximately parallel to the yso locus , thus any extinction difference between the sub - clusters can not masquerade as an age difference .    by binning the @xmath65 axis into half magnitude bins between @xmath65 colors of @xmath10 and @xmath154",
    ", we find the median @xmath64 magnitude of all the young sources in each bin .",
    "we then examine the offset of the @xmath64 magnitude distribution for each sub - cluster from the median @xmath64 magnitude by subtracting the median @xmath64 magnitude of a given color bin from the @xmath64 magnitude for each source in the same color bin .",
    "next , we plot the normalized histogram of the distribution of the offsets for each sub - cluster . due to the larger luminosity of younger stars of a given mass",
    ", we would expect a younger subset of stars to have a negative offset from the overall median .",
    "conversely , an older subset would have a positive offset .",
    "an examination of fig .",
    "[ v_vmi_sub ] shows that the sub - sample of sources from the western sub - cluster has a median offset that is slightly negative ( -0.2 mag ) , while the eastern sub - cluster has an offset consistent with zero .",
    "if we consider the @xmath155 myr isochrone from the model of @xcite and shift it by an amount @xmath156 mag along the v magnitude axis in @xmath64 vs. @xmath65 color - magnitude space , this shift corresponds to an age difference of @xmath157 myr for stars within the @xmath158 to @xmath159 mass range .    the full width half maximum of the distributions of offsets in fig .",
    "[ v_vmi_sub ] is about 1 mag for both sub - clusters .",
    "if we interpret this as a proxy for an age spread , then the age spreads for the sub - clusters are roughly 6 myr , using the same assumptions as above . an age spread in the cluster",
    "is expected : we find both regions of the cluster that have dispersed their gas and have low disk fractions as well as regions of ongoing star formation .",
    "however , there are various sources of scatter in the luminosities of ysos that could be mistaken for an age spread .",
    "potential sources of scatter are discussed in recent papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if this scatter is accounted for , we would expect the age spread to be much smaller .",
    "we will examine the observed scatter in a future paper .",
    "an examination of the disk fraction as a function of age curve from @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig_jesus ] ) shows a roughly @xmath160 myr@xmath24 drop in the disk fraction between the ages of 2 and 6 myr .",
    "if we assume a 1 myr age difference between the sub - clusters , then we find a @xmath161 myr@xmath24 drop in the disk fraction using the x - ray sample and a @xmath162 myr@xmath24 drop in the disk fraction using the visible sample .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the disk fraction curve from @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if we assume that there is an age difference of 1  myr , then the large disk fraction difference seen in the blue bin in table [ color_table ] could imply that disk dissipation is more rapid in the higher mass stars .",
    "this would be consistent with the observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "\\1 ) we have surveyed the full spatial extent of the young cep ob3b cluster with the irac and mips instruments onboard @xmath12 , and revealed over 1000 young stellar objects with infrared excesses .",
    "in addition we have performed @xmath0 imaging of the cluster with the acis instrument . using these and archival @xmath0 data ,",
    "we find 499 x - ray bright , young stars without infrared excesses .",
    "we find most of the cluster lies in a cavity of low extinction .",
    "the spatial distribution of these young sources shows a hierarchical morphology composed of two large sub - clusters with a diffuse halo .",
    "the two sub - clusters are associated with separate molecular clumps which contain ongoing star formation .",
    "\\2 ) using these data we constrain the location of potential cep ob3b members in @xmath64 and @xmath65 color - magnitude space .",
    "we use these constraints , in addition to the known x - ray detections , to identify the diskless class iii sources , and conduct a census of the young members of cep ob3b .",
    "the average disk fraction for the region is @xmath105 .",
    "these data , show cep  ob3b as a massive , nearby young cluster containing about 3000 stars , depending on the number of diskless pre - ms stars .",
    "\\3 ) using this census of near - ir excess and diskless sources , we create a disk fraction map of the cluster .",
    "we find that the observed disk fraction varies spatially throughout the cluster , with a significant difference in the disk fractions of the two sub - clusters ; @xmath3 in the eastern sub - cluster and @xmath4 in the western sub - cluster .",
    "this difference is dominated by the sources with the bluest @xmath65 colors , corresponding to the higher mass members of the sub - clusters ( @xmath8 1.7  @xmath102 ) .",
    "\\4 ) we compare the spatial variation in the disk fraction against the location of the most massive stars in the cluster and find no clear signature of disk photoevaporation .",
    "further , using visible photometry , we estimate the age difference between the two sub - clusters to be as much as 1 myr .",
    "the different disk fractions in the sub - clusters over this age range is consistent with the rate of observed disk dissipation in other star forming regions .",
    "we conclude that the most likely reason for the spatially varying disk fraction is a mixture of ages .",
    "\\5 ) we find that the size and membership of cep ob3b is similar to that of the onc , making it one of the largest , known , dense , young clusters within 1 kpc of the sun .",
    "most of the cep ob3b cluster lies in a low - extinction cavity , suggesting that cep ob3b has largely dispersed its natal gas and is more evolved than the more embedded onc .",
    "the size and evolutionary state of cep ob3b makes it a unique target for studying the evolution of young clusters .",
