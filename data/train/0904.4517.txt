    "there are many difficulties in the study of zero - energy states of supersymmetric matrix models .",
    "some arise due to the fact that the spectrum of the associated hamiltonian is continuous , starting at zero .",
    "accordingly , we expect it to be useful to shift to a weighted hilbert space on which the corresponding operator has a discrete spectrum .    in this work",
    "we illustrate the applicability of the technique to a simplified model which , despite its technical simplicity , still shares many of the features ( and difficulties ) of the original matrix models .",
    "the spectral properties of this so - called _ supermembrane toy model _ , and its purely bosonic counterpart , has been previously studied in @xcite , while the underlying geometry of the model was emphasized in @xcite .",
    "our results on the technically much more complicated matrix models will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    in section 2",
    "we recall the formulation of the original toy model and introduce the weighted hilbert space approach . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we investigate the spectral properties of the weighted model , and show that , under a certain condition on the parameter of the weight , the spectrum of the weighted model is in fact discrete .",
    "this is accomplished using a cwikel - lieb - rozenblum - type bound for operator - valued potentials which is derived in section 5 from a result in @xcite .",
    "we also note that the technique we use could provide a geometric understanding of the eigenvalue asymptotics of the purely bosonic model .",
    "the supermembrane toy model , also called the supersymmetric @xmath0 potential , is defined by the hamiltonian operator @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 are pauli matrices ) , acting on the hilbert space @xmath3 a corresponding hermitian supercharge operator is given by @xmath4 such that @xmath5 .",
    "the matrix - valued schrdinger operator @xmath6 can be formally defined as a self - adjoint operator through the closure of the quadratic form corresponding to the expression on @xmath7 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath6 is @xmath8 due to potential valleys along the coordinate axes , where the lower eigenvalue of the matrix potential , @xmath9 tends to negative infinity  precisely cancelling the localization energy due to the narrowing of the valley .",
    "we would like to make the spectrum of the model discrete by introducing a weighted hilbert space .",
    "we define @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the inner product on @xmath12 is then given by @xmath13 the corresponding self - adjoint operator @xmath14 on @xmath12 is defined through the same quadratic form on @xmath7 ; @xmath15 it follows that , if we define @xmath16 ( with adjoint w.r.t @xmath12 given by @xmath17 ) we have @xmath18 we observe in general that any solution of @xmath19 in @xmath20 is also a solution of @xmath21 in the weighted hilbert space . on the other hand ,",
    "finding a solution of @xmath21 in @xmath12 does yield a ( smooth ) solution to the differential equation @xmath19 , but its decay rate may be insufficient for square - integrability . for this particular model",
    "it is known @xcite that there is _ no _ solution in @xmath20 .",
    "continuity of the spectrum of @xmath6 can be proved ( see @xcite ) by , for any @xmath23 , finding a weyl sequence @xmath24 in @xmath20 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 explicitly ( and for @xmath27 for simplicity ) , we take @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a cut - off function s.t .",

    "furthermore , the number of negative eigenvalues is bounded by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are positive constants , and @xmath63 .",
    "our strategy is to prove this by splitting the domain of the operator into different regions  based on the geometry of the potential valleys  and introducing dirichlet boundary conditions between these regions by means of a partition of unity .",
    "the unbounded region along the potential valley is then shown to admit only finitely many negative eigenvalues using a cwikel - lieb - rozenblum bound for operator - valued potentials . in order to illustrate the latter part of this procedure ,",
