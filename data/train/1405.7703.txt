    "without much exaggeration one may say that optics is basically the science of light interference .",
    "light interference effects were behind the final acceptance of classical wave optics and abandoning the newtonian corpuscular theory of light .",
    "conceptual insight into the process of interfering light waves prompted development of a number of measurement techniques involving well controlled interference effects and gave birth to the field of optical interferometry @xcite .",
    "at the fundamental level , classical interferometry is all about observing light intensity variations ( intensity fringes ) resulting from a change in relative phases between two ( or more ) overlapping light waves , e.g.  when a single light beam is split into a number of paths with tunable optical path - length differences and made to interfere on the screen .",
    "the number of applications is stunning and ranges from basic length measurements via spectroscopic interferometric techniques to the most spectacular examples involving stellar interferometry and gravitational - wave detectors @xcite .",
    "coherent properties of light as well as the degree of overlap between the interfering beams determine the visibility of the observed intensity fringes and are crucial for the quality of any interferometric measurement .",
    "still , when asking for fundamental limitations on precision of estimating e.g.  a phase difference between the arms of a mach - zehnder interferometer , there is no particular answer within a purely classical theory , where both the light itself as well as the detection process are treated classically .",
    "in classical theory intensity of light can in principle be measured with arbitrary precision and as such allows to detect in principle arbitrary small phase shifts in an interferometric experiment .",
    "this , however , is no longer true when semi - classical theory is considered in which the light is still treated classically but the detection process is quantized , so that instead of a continuous intensity parameter the number of energy quanta ( photons ) absorbed is being measured .",
    "the absorption process within the semi - classical theory has a stochastic character and the number of photons detected obeys poissonian or super - poissonian statistics @xcite .",
    "if light intensity fluctuations can be neglected , the number of photons detected , @xmath0 , follows the poissonian statistics with photon number standard deviation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the mean number of photons detected .",
    "this implies that the determination of the relative phase difference @xmath3 between the arms of the interferometer , based on the number of photons detected at the output ports , will be affected by the relative uncertainty @xmath4 referred to as the _ shot noise_. the shot noise plays a fundamental role in the semi - classical theory and in many cases it is indeed the factor limiting achievable interferometric sensitivities .",
    "in modern gravitational wave detectors , in particular , the shot noise is the dominant noise term in the noise spectral density for frequencies above few hundred @xcite .",
    "yet , the shot noise should not be regarded as a fundamental bound whenever non - classical states of light are considered  we review the essential aspects of non - classical light relevant from the point of view of interferometry in sec .  [",
    "sec : states ] .",
    "the _ sub - poissonian _ statistics characteristic for the so - called squeezed states of light may offer a precision enhancement in interferometric scenarios by reducing the photon number fluctuations at the output ports .",
    "first proposals demonstrated that sending coherent light together with the squeezed vacuum state into the two separate input ports of a mach - zehnder interferometer offers estimation precision beating the shot noise and attaining the @xmath5 scaling of the phase estimation precision @xcite , while consideration of more general two - mode squeezed states showed that even @xmath6 scaling is possible @xcite .",
    "a number of papers followed , studying in more detail the phase - measurement probability distribution and proposing various strategies leading to @xmath6 precision scaling @xcite .",
    "similar observations have been made in the context of precision spectroscopy , where spin - squeezed states have been shown to offer a @xmath7 scaling of atomic transition frequency estimation precision , where @xmath0 denotes the number of atoms employed @xcite .",
    "[ sec : interferometers ] provides a detailed framework for deriving the above results .",
    "however , already at this point a basic intuition should be conveyed that one _ can not _ go beyond the shot noise limit whenever an interferometric experiment may be regarded in a spirit that each photon interferes only with itself .",
    "in fact , the only possibility of surpassing this bound is to use light sources that exhibit correlations in between the constituent photons , e.g.  squeezed light , so that the interference process may benefit from the properties of inter - photonic entanglement .",
    "these early results provided a great physical insight into the possibilities of quantum enhanced interferometry and the class of states that might be of practical interest for this purpose .",
    "the papers lacked generality , however , by considering specific measurement - estimation strategies , in which the error in the estimated phase was related via a simple error - propagation formula to the variance of some experimentally accessible observable , e.g.  photon number difference at the two output ports of the interferometer , or by studying the width of the peaks in the shape of the phase - measurement probability distribution .",
    "given a particular state of light fed into the interferometer , it is a priori not clear what is the best measurement and estimation strategy yielding the optimal estimation precision .",
    "luckily , the tools designed to answer these kinds of questions had already been present in the literature under the name of _ quantum estimation theory _ @xcite .",
    "the _ quantum fisher information _ ( qfi ) as well as the _ cost of bayesian inference _ provide a systematic way to quantify the ultimate limits on performance of phase - estimation strategies for a given quantum state , which are already optimized over all theoretically admissible quantum measurements and estimators .",
    "the concept of the qfi and the bayesian approach to quantum estimation are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimation ] .",
    "as a side remark , we should note , that by treating the phase as an evolution parameter to be estimated and separating explicitly the measurement operators from the estimator function , quantum estimation theory circumvents some of the mathematical difficulties that arise if one insists on the standard approach to quantum measurements and attempts to define the _ quantum phase operator _ representing the phase observable being measured @xcite .",
    "the growth of popularity of the qfi in the field of quantum metrology was triggered by the seminal paper of @xcite advocating the use of qfi as a natural measure of distance in the space of quantum states .",
    "the qfi allows to pin down the optimal probe states that are the most sensitive to small variations of the estimated parameter by establishing the fundamental bound on the corresponding parameter sensitivity valid for arbitrary measurements and estimators .",
    "following these lines of reasoning the @xmath7 bound , referred to as the _ heisenberg limit _",

    "i.e.  the one in which an @xmath0-particle state evolves under a unitary @xmath8 , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being a general single - particle evolution generator and @xmath3 the parameter to be estimated @xcite .",
    "a complementary framework allowing to determine the fundamental bounds in interferometry is the bayesian approach , in which one assumes the estimated parameter to be a random variable itself and explicitly defines its _ prior _ distribution to account for the initial knowledge about @xmath3 before performing the estimation . in the case of interferometry",
    "the typical choice is the flat prior @xmath11 which reflects the initial ignorance of the phase .",
    "the search for the optimal estimation strategies within the bayesian approach is possible thanks to the general theorem on the optimality of the _ covariant measurements _ in estimation problems satisfying certain group symmetry @xcite . in the case of interferometry ,",
    "a flat prior guarantees the phase - shift , u(1 ) , symmetry and as a result the optimal measurement operators can be given explicitly and they coincide with the eigenstates of the pegg - barnett `` phase operator '' @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to optimize the strategy over the input states and for simple cost functions allows to find the optimal probe states @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath12 cost function which approximates the variance for small phase deviations @xmath13 , the corresponding minimal estimation uncertainty has been found to read @xmath14 for large @xmath0 providing again a proof of the possibility of achieving the heisenberg scaling , yet with an additional @xmath15 coefficient .",
    "it should be noted that the optimal states in the above approach that have been found independently in @xcite have completely different structure to the noon states which are optimal when qfi is considered as the figure of merit .",
    "this is not that surprising taking into account that the noon states suffer from the @xmath16 ambiguity in retrieving the estimated phase , and hence are designed only to work in the local estimation approach when phase fluctuations can be considered small .",
    "derivations of the heisenberg bounds for phase interferometry using both the qfi and bayesian approaches are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ideal ] .",
    "we also discuss the problem of deriving the bounds for states with indefinite photon number in which case replacing @xmath0 in the derived bounds with the mean number of photons @xmath2 is not always legitimate , so that in some cases the `` naive '' heisenberg bound @xmath6 may in principle be beaten @xcite .",
    "further progress in theoretical quantum metrology stemmed from the need to incorporate realistic decoherence processes in the analysis of the optimal estimation strategies .",
    "while deteriorating effects of noise on precision in quantum - enhanced metrological protocols have been realized by many authors working in the field @xcite , it has long remained an open question to what extent decoherence effects may be circumvented by employing either more sophisticated states of light or more advanced measurements strategies including e.g.  adaptive techniques .",
    "with respect to the most relevant decoherence process in optical applications , i.e.  the photonic losses , strong numerical evidence based on the qfi @xcite indicated that in the asymptotic limit of large number of photons the precision of the optimal quantum protocols approaches @xmath17 , and hence the gain over classical strategies is bound to a constant factor .",
    "this fact has been first rigorously proven within the bayesian approach @xcite and then independently using the qfi @xcite .",
    "both approaches yielded the same fundamental bound on precision in the lossy optical interferometry : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the overall power transmission of an interferometric setup .",
    "this bound is also valid after replacing @xmath0 with @xmath2 when dealing with states of indefinite photon number , and moreover can be easily saturated using the most popular scheme involving a coherent and a squeezed - vacuum state impinged onto two input ports of the mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite .",
    "this fact also implies that the presently implemented quantum enhanced schemes in gravitational wave detection , based on interfering the squeezed vacuum with coherent light , operate close to the fundamental bound @xcite , i.e.  they make almost optimal use of non - classical features of light for enhanced sensing given light power and loss levels present in the setup .",
    "based on the mathematical analysis of the geometry of quantum channels @xcite general frameworks have been developed allowing to find fundamental bounds on quantum precision enhancement for general decoherence models @xcite .",
    "these tools allow to investigate optimality of estimation strategies for basically any decoherence model and typically provide the maximum allowable constant factor improvements forbidding better than @xmath20 asymptotic scaling of precision .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] with a summary and an outlook on challenging problems in the theory of quantum enhanced metrology .",
    "the advent of the laser , light - squeezing and single - photon light sources triggered developments in interferometry that could benefit from the non - classical features of light @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the quantum - light description of relevance to quantum optical interferometry .",
    "we discuss the mode description of light and the most commonly used states in quantum optics  the gaussian states . in the end",
    ", we consider states of definite photon - number and study their particle - description , in particular , investigating their relevant entanglement properties .      classically , electromagnetic field can be divided into orthogonal modes distinguished by their characteristic spatial , temporal and polarization properties .",
    "this feature survives in the quantum description of light , where formally we may associate a separate quantum subsystem with each of these modes .",
    "each subsystem is described by its own hilbert space and , because photons are bosons , can be occupied by an arbitrary number of particles @xcite .",
    "the most general @xmath21-mode state of light may be then written as : @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 representing a fock state with _ exactly _",

    "eventually , photon numbers are detected in the output modes allowing to infer the value of the relative phase difference between the arms of the interferometer .",

    "most importantly , it may be reconstructed from experimental data either by tomographic methods @xcite or by direct probing of the phase space @xcite , and hence is an extremely useful representation both for theoretical and experimental purposes .      from the practical point of view ,",
    "the most interesting class of states are the gaussian states @xcite .",
    "the great advantage of using them is that they are relatively easy to produce in the laboratory with the help of standard laser - sources and non - linear optical elements , which allow to introduce non - classical features such as squeezing or entanglement .",
    "gaussian states have found numerous application in various fields of quantum information processing @xcite and are also extensively employed in quantum metrological protocols .",
    "gaussian states of @xmath21 modes are fully characterized by their first and second quadrature moments and are most conveniently represented using the wigner function which is then just a multidimensional gaussian distribution @xmath41 where for a more compact notation we have introduced : the phase space variable @xmath42 , the vector containing mean quadrature values @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the @xmath45 dimensional _ covariance matrix _",
    "@xmath46 : @xmath47 gaussian states remain gaussian under arbitrary evolution involving hamiltonians at most quadratic in the quadrature operators , what includes all passive devices such as beam - splitters and phase - shifters as well as single- and multi - mode squeezing operations .",
    "below we focus on a few classes of gaussian states highly relevant to interferometry .",
    "coherent states are the gaussian states with identity covariance matrix @xmath48 , so that the uncertainties are equal for all quadratures saturating the heisenberg uncertainty relations @xmath49 and there are no correlations between the modes .",
    "mean values of quadratures may be arbitrary and correspond to the coherent state complex amplitude @xmath50 these are the states produced by any phase - stabilized laser , what makes them almost a fundamental tool in the theoretical description of many quantum optical experiments .",
    "moreover , coherent sates have properties that resemble features of classical light , and thus enable to establish a bridge between the quantum and classical descriptions of light .",
    "in the standard representation , an @xmath21-mode coherent state @xmath51 is a tensor product of single - mode coherent states , whereas a single - mode coherent state is an eigenstate of the respective annihilation operator : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are respectively the amplitude and the phase of a coherent state .",
    "equivalently , we may write @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the so - called _ displacement operator _ or write the coherent state explicitly as a superposition of consecutive fock states : @xmath57 from the formula above , it is clear that coherent states do not have a definite photon number and if a photon number @xmath58 is measured its distribution follows the poissonian statistics @xmath59 with average @xmath60 and standard deviation @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the relative uncertainty @xmath62 in the measured photon number scales like @xmath63 and hence in the classical limit of large @xmath64 the beam power may be determined up to arbitrary precision . moreover",
    ", the evolution of the coherent state amplitude is identical to the evolution of a classical - wave amplitude .",
    "in particular , an optical phase delay @xmath3 transforms the state @xmath65 into @xmath66 .",
    "these facts justify a common jargon of calling coherent states the classical states of light , even though for relatively small amplitudes different coherent states may be hard to distinguish due to their non - orthogonality @xmath67 . more generally , we call @xmath68 a classical state of light if and only if it can be written as a mixture of coherent states : @xmath69 with @xmath70 , which is equivalent to the statement that @xmath68 admits a non - negative glauber @xmath71-representation @xcite .",
    "classical states are often used as a benchmark to test the degree of possible quantum enhancement which may be obtained by using more general states outside this class .",
    "heisenberg uncertainty principle imposes that @xmath72 for all possible quantum states .",
    "single - mode states that saturate this inequality are called the _ single - mode squeezed states _ @xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "coherent states fall into such a category serving as a special example for which @xmath73 . yet , as for general squeezed states @xmath74 , the noise in one of the quadratures can be made smaller than in the other . formally ,",
    "a single - mode squeezed state may always be expressed as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the _ squeezing operator _",
    ", @xmath77 is a complex number and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the _ squeezing factor _ and the _ squeezing angle _ respectively .",
    "in fact , any pure gaussian one - mode state may be written in the above form . for @xmath80 , uncertainties in the quadratures @xmath81 and @xmath82 read @xmath83 and @xmath84reduction of noise in one quadrature is accompanied by an added noise in the other one .",
    "this may be conveniently visualized in the phase - space picture by error disks representing uncertainty in quadratures in different directions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : squeezed ] .",
    "in such a representation squeezed states correspond to ellipses while coherent states are represented by circles .",
    "importantly , the fact that the uncertainty of one of the quadratures can be less relatively to the other makes it possible to design an interferometric scheme where the measured photon number fluctuations are below that of a coherent state and allows for a sub - shot noise phase estimation precision , see sec .  [ sec : interferometers ] .    .",
    "[ fig : squeezed ] ]    as squeezed states in general can not be described as mixtures of coherent states , they are non - classical and their features can not be fully described by classical electrodynamics .",
    "nevertheless , they can be relatively easily prepared using non - linear optical elements in the process of parametric down conversion @xcite .",
    "the special type of squeezed states which is most relevant from the metrological perspective is the class of the _ squeezed vacuum states _ that possess vanishing mean values of their quadratures , i.e.  @xmath85 : @xmath86 in the fock basis a squeezed vacuum state reads @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes values of @xmath58-th hermite polynomial at @xmath89 . as for odd @xmath58 @xmath90 is antisymmetric and thus @xmath91 , it follows that squeezed vacuum states are superpositions of fock states with only _ even _ photon numbers .",
    "the average number of photons in a squeezed vacuum state is given by @xmath92 , what means that , despite their name , a squeezed vacuum states contain photons , possibly a lot of them .",
    "the simplest non - classical two - mode gaussian state is the so - called two - mode squeezed vacuum state or the _ twin - beam state _ @xcite .",
    "mathematically , such a state is generated from the vacuum by a two - mode squeezing operation , so that @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 , whereas in the fock basis it reads @xmath96 a notable feature of the twin - beam state , which may be clearly seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tbsfock ] ) , is that it is not a product of squeezed states in modes @xmath97 and @xmath98 , but rather it is correlated in between them being a superposition of terms with the same number of photons in both modes .",
    "its first moments of all quadratures are zero , @xmath85 , whereas in the case of @xmath99 its covariance matrix has a particularly simple form : @xmath100 such a covariance matrix clearly indicates the presence of correlations between the modes and since the state ( [ eq : tbs ] ) is pure this implies immediately the presence of the _ mode - entanglement_. in fact , in the limit of large squeezing coefficient @xmath101 such twin - beam state becomes the original famous einstein - podolsky - rosen state @xcite that violates assumptions of any realistic local hidden variable theory .",
    "twin - beam states may be generated in a laboratory by various non - linear processes such as four- and three - wave mixing @xcite .",
    "alternatively , they may be produced by mixing two single - mode squeezed vacuum states with opposite squeezing angles on a fifty - fifty beam - splitter .",
    "general two - mode gaussian state is rather difficult to write in the fock basis , so it is best characterized by its @xmath102 real symmetric covariance matrix @xmath103 } & { [ } \\sigma_{12}{]}\\\\ { [ } \\sigma_{21 } { ] } & { [ } \\sigma_{22 } { ] } \\end{array } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath104 represent blocks with @xmath105 matrices describing correlations between the @xmath26-th and the @xmath106-th mode , and the vector of the first moments @xmath107 .",
    "this in total gives up to fourteen real parameters describing the state : ten covariances , two displacement amplitudes and two phases of displacement .",
    "general gaussian states are in principle feasible within current technological state of art , as any pure gaussian state can theoretically be generated from the vacuum by utilizing only a combination of one- , two - mode squeezing and displacement operations with help of beam - splitters and one - mode rotations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mixed gaussian states are obtained as a result of tracing out some of the system degrees of freedom , which is effectively the case in the presence of light losses , or by adding a gaussian noise to the state .",
    "gaussian states are important from the practical point of view due to the relative ease with which their may be prepared . from a conceptual point of view , however , when asking fundamental questions on limits to quantum enhancement in interferometry , states with a definite photon number prove to be a better choice .",
    "the main reason is that photons are typically regarded as a resource in interferometry and when benchmarking different interferometric schemes it is natural to restrict the class of states with the same number of photons , i.e.  the same resources consumed .",
    "a general @xmath21-mode state consisting of @xmath0 photons is given by : @xmath108 where @xmath109 , so that the summation is restricted only to terms with exactly @xmath0 photons in all the modes .",
    "apart from the vacuum state @xmath32 no gaussian state falls into this category .",
    "states with an exact photon number are extensively used in other fields of quantum information processing , including quantum communication and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "most of the quantum computation and communication schemes are designed with such states in mind , as they provide the most intuitive and clear picture of the role the quantum features play in these tasks . for large @xmath0 ,",
    "however , states with a definite photon numbers are notoriously hard to prepare and states with @xmath0 of the order of @xmath110 can only be produced with the present technology pushed to its limits @xcite . when considering states with definite @xmath0 , it is also possible to easily switch between the mode- and particle - description of the states of light , which is a feature that we discuss in the following section .",
    "when dealing with states of definite photon number , instead of thinking about modes as quantum subsystems that possess some number of excitations ( photons ) , we may equivalently consider the `` first quantization '' formalism and regard photons themselves as elementary subsystems .",
    "fundamentally , photons are indistinguishable particles and since they are bosons their wave function should always be permutation - symmetric . still , it is common in the literature to use a description in which photons are regarded as distinguishable particles and adopt a notation such that @xmath111 denotes a product state of @xmath0 photons , where the @xmath26-th photon occupies the mode @xmath112 .",
    "we explicitly add subscripts to the kets above labeling each constituent photon , in order to distinguish this notation from the mode description of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhogeneral ] ) , where kets denoted various modes and not the distinct particles .",
    "the description ( [ eq:|m > ] ) is legitimate provided there are some degrees of freedom that ascribe a meaning to the statement _ `` the @xmath26-th photon''_. for example , in the case when photons are prepared in non - overlapping time - bins , the time - bin degree of freedom plays the role of the label indicating a _ particular _ photon , whereas the spatial characteristics determine the state of a _ given _ photon .",
    "nevertheless , if we assume the overall wave function describing also the temporal degrees of freedom of the complete state to be fully symmetric , the notion of the `` @xmath26-th photon '' becomes meaningless .",
    "a general pure state of @xmath0 `` distinguishable '' photons has the form : @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "if indeed there is no additional degree of freedom that makes the notion of `` the @xmath26-th photon '' meaningful , the above state should posses the symmetry property such that @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is an arbitrary permutation of the @xmath0 indices .",
    "consider for example a fock state @xmath117 of @xmath118 indistinguishable photons in @xmath21 modes . in the particle description",
    "the state has the form : @xmath119 where the sum is performed over all non - trivial permutations @xmath116 of the indices inside the curly brackets @xcite . since",
    "all quantum states may be written in the fock basis representation , by the above construction one can always translate any quantum state to the particle description .",
    "one of the most important features which makes the quantum theory different from the classical one is the notion of entanglement @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon plays also an important role in quantum metrology and is often claimed to be the crucial resource for the enhancement of the measurement precision @xcite .",
    "conflicting statements can be found in the literature , however , as some of the authors claim that entanglement is not indispensable to get a quantum precision enhancement @xcite .",
    "this confusion stems simply from the fact that entanglement is a relative concept dependent on the way we divide the relevant hilbert space into particular subsystems . in order to clarify these issues ,",
    "it is necessary to explicitly study relation between mode- and particle - entanglement , i.e.  entanglement with respect to different tensor product structures used in the two descriptions .",
    "firstly , let us go through basic definitions and notions of entanglement .",
    "the state @xmath120 of two parties @xmath121 and @xmath122 is called separable if and only if one can write it as a mixture of product of states of individual subsystems : @xmath123 entangled states are defined as all states that are not separable .",
    "a crucial feature of entanglement is that it depends on the _ division _ into subsystems .",
    "for example , consider three qubits @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath124 and their joint quantum state @xmath125 .",
    "this state is separable with respect to the @xmath126 cut but is entangled with respect to the @xmath127 cut .",
    "as a first example , consider a two - mode fock state @xmath128 which represents one photon in mode @xmath97 and one photon in mode @xmath98 .",
    "this state written in the mode formalism of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhogeneral ] ) is clearly separable . on the other hand ,",
    "photons are indistinguishable bosons and if we would like to write their state in the particle formalism of eq .",
    "( [ eq:|m > ] ) we have to symmetrize over all possible permutations of particles , thus obtaining the state @xmath129 in this representation the state is clearly entangled .",
    "we may thus say that the state contains _ particle _ entanglement but _ not _ the _ mode _ entanglement .    if , however , we perform the hong - ou - mandel experiment and send the @xmath128 state through a balanced beam - splitter which transforms mode annihilation operators as @xmath130 , @xmath131 , the resulting state reads : @xmath132 which is _ both _ mode- and particle - entangled .",
    "mode entanglement emerges because the beam - splitter is a joint operation over two modes that introduces correlations between them . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a local operation with respect to the particles , i.e.  it can be written as @xmath133 in the particle representation , and does not couple photons with each other .",
    "thus , using a beam - splitter one may change mode entanglement but not the content of particle entanglement .    as a second example , consider two modes of light , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , each of them in coherent state with the same amplitude @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "this state clearly has _ no _ mode entanglement .",
    "since this state does not have a definite photon number , in order to ask questions about the particle entanglement we first need to consider its projection on one of the @xmath0-photon subspaces  one can think of a non - demolition total photon - number measurement yielding result @xmath0 .",
    "after normalizing the projected state we obtain : @xmath136^{(n)}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}}\\sum_{n=0}^{n}\\sqrt{n \\choose n}{| n \\rangle}_a{| n - n \\rangle}_b,\\ ] ] which in the particle representation reads : @xmath137 and is clearly a separable state . the fact that products of coherent states contain",
    "no particle entanglement is in agreement with our definition of classical state given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : class ] ) being a mixture of products of coherent states .",
    "a _ classical state _ according to this definition will contain _ neither _ mode nor particle entanglement .    as a last example , consider the case of particular interest for quantum interferometry , i.e. a coherent state of mode @xmath97 and a squeezed vacuum state of mode @xmath98 : @xmath138 .",

    "note that noon states and the sine states that are optimal in case of qfi and bayesian approaches in the decoherence - free case are notoriously hard to prepare apart from regime of very small @xmath0 . for large photon numbers , the only practically accessible states of light are squeezed gaussian states and one of the most popular strategies in performing quantum - enhanced interferometry amounts to mixing a coherent beam with a squeezed vacuum state on the input beam splitter of the mach - zehnder interferometer , see sec .",

    "we demonstrate below that in presence of uncorrelated decoherence , such as loss or imperfect visibility , this strategy is indeed optimal in the asymptotic regime of large @xmath0 and allows to saturate the fundamental bounds derived above .",
    "we will not discuss the phase - diffusion noise , since the estimation uncertainty is finite in the asymptotic limit , and the issue of saturating the asymptotic bound becomes trivial as practically all states lead to the same asymptotic precision value , while saturating the bound for finite @xmath0 requires the use of experimentally inaccessible sine states .",

    "we have already discussed the issue of translating the bounds from a definite photon number input state case to a general indefinite - photon number state case in sec .",
    "[ sec : idealindefinite ] in the case of decoherence - free metrology , where we have observed that due to quadratic dependence of qfi on number of photons used , maximization of qfi over states with fixed _ averaged _ photon number @xmath2 is ill defined and arbitrary high qfi are in principle achievable .",
    "controversies related to this observation , discussed in sec .  [ sec : optindefinitephotonnumber ] , are fortunately not present in the noisy metrology scenario .    for the decoherence models , analyzed in this paper , the qfi scales at most linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "following the reasoning presented in sec .",

    "since in the presence of decoherence @xmath730 , where @xmath731 is a constant coefficient that depends on the type and strength of the noise considered , thanks to the convexity of the qfi we can write : @xmath732 hence the bounds on precision derived in sec .",

    "the noon states remain optimal for relatively small @xmath0(@xmath755 ) , for which the effects of losses may be disregarded .",
    "this fact supports the choice of noon -like states in the quantum - enhanced experiments with small number of particles @xcite .",
    "however , one should note that in the presence of even infinitesimal losses , the precision achieved by the noon states quickly diverges with @xmath0 , because their corresponding output state qfi , @xmath757 , decays exponentially for any @xmath758 .",
    "most importantly , it should be stressed that the coherent+squeezed vacuum strategy discussed above has been implemented in recent gravitational - wave interferometry experiments @xcite .",
    "the main factor limiting the quantum enhancement of precision in this experiments is loss , which taking into account detection efficiency , optical instruments imperfections and imperfect coupling was estimated at the level of @xmath759 @xcite . in @xcite it has been demonstrated that the sensing precision achieved in @xcite using the @xmath760 squeezed vacuum ( corresponding to the squeezing factor @xmath761 ) , was strikingly close to the fundamental bound , and only @xmath762 further reduction in estimation uncertainty would be possible if more advanced input states of light were used .",
    "in this review we have showed how the tools of quantum estimation theory can be applied in order to derive fundamental bounds on achievable precision in quantum - enhanced optical interferometric experiments . the main message to be conveyed is the fact that while the power of quantum enhancement is seriously reduced by the presence of decoherence , and in general the heisenberg scaling can not be reached , non - classical states of light offer a noticeable improvement in interferometric precision and simple experimental schemes may approach arbitrary close the fundamental quantum bounds .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the presence of uncorrelated decoherence the bayesian approaches coincide asymptotically with the qfi approaches easing the tension between this two often competing ways of statistical analysis .",
    "we would also like to mention an inspiring alternative approach to the derivation of limits on precision of phase estimation , where the results are derived making use of information theoretic concepts such as rate - distortion theory @xcite or entropic uncertainty relations @xcite . even though the bounds derived in this way are weaker than the bounds presented in this review and obtained via bayesian or qfi approaches , they carry a conceptual appeal encouraging to look for deeper connections between quantum estimation and communication theories .",
    "let us also point out , that while we have focused our discussion on optical interferometry using the paradigmatic mach - zehnder model , the same methods can be applied to address the problems of fundamental precision bounds in atomic interferometry @xcite , magnetometry @xcite , frequency stabilization in atomic clocks @xcite as well as the limits on resolution of quantum enhanced lithographic protocols @xcite .",
    "all these setups can be cast into a common mathematical framework , see sec .",
    "[ sec : otherinterferometers ] , but the resulting bounds will depend strongly on the nature of dominant decoherence effects and the relevant resource limitations such as : total experimental time , light power , number of atoms etc . , as well as on the chosen figure of merit .",
    "in particular , it is not excluded that in some atomic metrological scenarios one may still obtain a better than @xmath20 of precision if decoherence is of a special form allowing for use of the decoherence - free subspaces @xcite or when its impact may be significantly reduced by considering short evolution times , in which the sql - like scaling bounds may in principle be circumvented by : adjusting decoherence geometry @xcite or by considering non - markovian short - time behaviour @xcite .",
    "we should also note that application of the tools presented in this review to a proper analysis of fundamental limits to the operation of quantum enhanced atomic clocks @xcite is not that direct as it requires taking into account precise frequency noise characteristic of the local oscillator , allowing to determine the optimal stationary operation regime of the clock @xcite ideally in terms of the allan variance taken as a figure of merit @xcite . a deeper theoretical insight into this problem is still required to yield computable fundamental bounds .",
    "the applicability of the tools presented has also been restricted to single phase parameter estimation .",
    "a more general approach may be taken , were multiple - phases @xcite or the phase as well as the decoherence strength itself are the quantities to be estimated @xcite .",
    "this poses an additional theoretical challenge as then the multi - parameter quantum estimation theory needs to be applied , while most of the tools discussed in this review are applicable only to single - parameter estimation .",
    "developing non - trivial multi - parameter fundamental bounds for quantum metrology is therefore still an open field for research .",

    "<S> non - classical states of light find applications in enhancing the performance of optical interferometric experiments , with notable example of gravitational wave - detectors . </S>",
    "<S> still , the presence of decoherence hinders significantly the performance of quantum - enhanced protocols . in this review , we summarize the developments of quantum metrology with particular focus on optical interferometry and derive fundamental bounds on achievable quantum - enhanced precision in optical interferometry taking into account the most relevant decoherence processes including : phase diffusion , losses and imperfect interferometric visibility . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce all the necessary tools of quantum optics as well as quantum estimation theory required to derive the bounds . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the practical attainability of the bounds derived and stress in particular that the techniques of quantum - enhanced interferometry which are being implemented in modern gravitational wave detectors are close to the optimal ones .    , </S>"
