    "is intimately related to the physical properties of molecular gas . physical conditions of molecular gas determine whether stars can form .",
    "for example , observations of galactic molecular gas show that star formation are often associated with dense gas @xcite .",
    "this is true even for the galactic - scale observations as reported by @xcite .",
    "after the stars form , they heat and recycle materials back into the surrounding molecular gas , reform the gas by which star formation cycle can start again ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to the local gas conditions , extragalactic observations have shown increasing signs that molecular gas and star formation are aware of their galactic - scale environments .",
    "dynamical properties of galaxies ( e.g. , bar and spiral arms ) are responsible for redistributing molecular gas , controlling their formation , evolution and ability of star formation @xcite .",

    "* ) .    to date",
    ", studies of extragalactic molecular gas have mostly used single molecular line of @xmath1co because the excitation conditions of this strong line are easily met . however , the low - density tracer alone is not sufficient to estimate properties that are more intimately related to star formation , e.g. , temperature and dense gas fraction .",
    "multi - molecular lines diagnosis is therefore indespensible to explore the relation of molecular gas , star formation , and galactic structures to a greater extent .    in this work , we investigate the physical properties of molecular gas and star formation activity in ngc 6946 .",
    "these are done by analysing the newly observed isotopic molecule @xmath0co ( 10 ) ( 100 pc resolution ) and dense gas tracer hcn ( 10 ) , along with other archival molecular data in @xmath1co ( 10 ) , ( 21 ) and star formation tracers in optical and infrared wavelengths .",
    "this is the first time that this galaxy has been observed in @xmath0co with high resolution , and one of the very few galaxies that we can perform isotopic line mapping down to this scale .",
    "ngc 6946 is chosen for this work for a number of reasons .",
    "the galaxy is close by at 5.5 mpc @xcite , allowing us to observe in high resolution .",
    "the face - on galaxy provides excellent viewing perspectives on the galactic structures ( figure [ fig_n6946opticalsmall ] ) . the adopted position angle ( p.a . ) and inclination are 243@xmath3 and 33@xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",

    "the dim dust lane ( or `` offset ridge '' towards the downstream of the galactic rotation ) of the northern primary bar ( @xmath2 1 kpc ) is seen in figure [ fig_n6946opticalsmall ] , while the southern dust lane is not clear .",
    "inner region of the primary bar is connected to the nuclear bar with length of @xmath2 400 pc .",

    "the temperature equivalent to the @xmath33 energy level is @xmath34 k , slightly above the typical gas temperature , and hence @xmath1co ( 21 ) is sensitive to slight enhancements in gas temperature or density of the bulk molecular gas @xcite",

    "the velocity dispersion of molecular clouds is almost always larger than the thermal line width , and in fact , this optically - think line can trace the entire volume within the clouds , and thus their mass .",
    "we use the @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) emission for calculation of molecular gas mass .",
    "the @xmath0co ( 10 ) emission ( hereafter @xmath0co ) is also used to trace bulk molecular gas .",
    "it is typically optically - thin , compared to @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) , and therefore , its effective critical density ( @xmath35 ) is an order of magnitude greater than that of @xmath1co , tracing slightly denser gas .",
    "abundance ratio of @xmath1co to @xmath0co is about 40  60 , therefore @xmath0co emission is significantly weaker than @xmath1co .",
    "the hcn ( 10 ) emission ( hereafter hcn ) is often used as a tracer of star - forming dense cores within molecular clouds .",
    "it has a high critical density ( @xmath2 10@xmath36 @xmath37 ) , and the hcn emission , even unresolved , should be coming selectively from the very dense regions within molecular clouds .",
    "the connection between these dense regions and star formation activities are seen in the linear correlation between hcn and tracers of star formation rate .",
    "we use hcn to constrain the amount of dense gas .",
    "enhanced hcn emission around agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be a source of confusion when the galactic center is the focus of study , but the mechanism of the enhancement is irrelevant here , since ngc 6946 has no appreciable supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "h@xmath8 and infrared emissions are often used to trace the intensity of star formation .",
    "both types of emissions are the second product of recently - formed young stars , with h@xmath8 emission from the gas ionized by uv photons from young , massive stars and infrared , such as 24@xmath7 m emission tracing the thermal radiation from dusts heated predominantly by young stars at the age up to @xmath2 10 myr @xcite .",
    "each emission has its own advantages and disadvantages in estimating star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "h@xmath8 typically provides a high spatial resolution , but suffers from dust extinction .",
    "the bottleneck of current infrared data is its relatively low spatial resolution , though the extinction is not so much a problem at the infrared wavelengths .",
    "the combination of the two may complement each other and provide a more accurate estimate of sfr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the spatial resolution may be an issue here since it needs to be adjusted to the lowest infrared resolution . here , we use 24 @xmath7 m and h@xmath8 emissions to gauge star formation activities .",
    "infrared color is used to infer dust temperature .",
    "young massive stars contribute to the sed at shorter wavelengths , producing a peak around @xmath2 60 @xmath7 m , while low - mass stars contribute to the sed at longer wavelengths , generating another peak around @xmath38 160 @xmath7 m @xcite .",
    "therefore , ratio of the fluxes around the two peaks provides a probe of dust and gas temperature . in this work ,",
    "we use 70 @xmath7 m to 160 @xmath7 m flux ratio or color to trace the temperature variation .",
    "the channel maps of @xmath0co are displayed in figure [ fig_channel ] with red contours , while the @xmath1co contours ( black ) are also plotted for reference ( the @xmath1co data also include carma and nro45 data ) .",
    "the galactic center is marked with a cross in each channel .",
    "there is a central peak around the galactic center .",
    "the central peak has a velocity width of @xmath2 180 km s@xmath10 , ranging from 34 km s@xmath10 to 149 km s@xmath10 .",
    "apart from the central component , two elongated structures emerging from the galactic center are seen , extending toward the north and the south , respectively .",
    "both sides show sharp velocity gradients across the elongated structures .",
    "such pattern is commonly seen in galactic bars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "emission in the northern region emerges from @xmath2 14 km s@xmath10 , spreading over @xmath2 112 km s@xmath10 .",
    "emission in the southern region emerges from @xmath2 39 km s@xmath10 , spreading over @xmath2 110 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the spatial and velocity distributions of @xmath0co and @xmath1co emission are similar in all channels .",
    "all @xmath0co peaks have counterparts in @xmath1co .",
    "this is a natural result as mentioned in  [ sec_tracers ] . on the contrary , @xmath0co is absent at some @xmath1co peak ( e.g. , 67 km s@xmath10 ) .",
    "it is due to either the detection limit or an insufficient density for @xmath0co excitation .",
    "the carma+nro45 map clearly shows the central component in details , resolving the central concentration elongated toward north - west to south - east directions .",
    "the semi - major axis of the elongation is about 8@xmath4 ( @xmath2 220 pc ) , corresponding to the secondary ( nuclear ) bar formed via local gravitational instability in the disk @xcite .",
    "structure inside the secondary bar is not resolved in our map .",
    "emission appears to extend toward north from the edge of this elongation reaching the radius of @xmath240@xmath4 toward north .",
    "we call this extension `` northern ridge '' , which has a bright peak near the carma field of view .",
    "the @xmath1co map from carma+nro45 is displayed in the lower - right panel of figure [ fig_individual_moment0s ] for comparison .",
    "the @xmath0co and @xmath1co maps are generally similar , though @xmath1co shows more continuous extension overall .",
    "for example , the emission extends smoothly along the northern ridge in @xmath1co , but shows a gap in @xmath0co at around the radius of 16@xmath4 ",
    "18@xmath4 which is between the central concentration and the northern ridge .",
    "the lack of @xmath0co emission could be due to an insufficient sensitivity for detection of this weak line , but we also point out that the level of @xmath0co emission must be lower than what is expected in assumption of the @xmath1co/@xmath0co line ratio of 15 , i.e. , the average over the area of significant @xmath0co detection within the northern ridge . assuming this ratio , the expected @xmath0co flux is @xmath2 1.8 jy beam@xmath10 km s@xmath10 in this gap , which should be detected at the 4 @xmath28 significance .",

    "the ratio is often referred to the dense gas fraction .",
    "@xmath40/@xmath41 suggests that the fraction of dense gas in the central region is similar to that in starburst galaxies such as lirgs and ulirgs , while values of the ridges are close to the global average values of normal galaxies .",
    "large - scale temperature distribution is calculated by the infrared color of @xmath99/@xmath100 .",
    "temperature is spatially correlated with star forming regions seen in 24@xmath7 m , suggesting that the large scale temperature distribution of ngc 6946 is driven by star formation .",
    "moreover , the relative temperatures among the regions of interest inferred by the infrared color are consistent with the results of lvg calculations .",
    "we discuss the variation of radial star formation efficiency ( sfe ) .",
    "radial sfe in the inner 2 kpc ( @xmath2 70@xmath4 ) of ngc 6946 is calculated using the gas traced by @xmath1co ( 10 ) ( because it can trace the entire volume within the bulk molecular gas ) and star formation activity traced by 24@xmath7 m and h@xmath8 (  [ sec_sfr ] ) .",
    "the key results are as follows .    1 .",
    "sfe of the north side of the galaxy is higher than that of the south side by @xmath2 2 times .",
    "for each side of the galaxy , radial sfe changes by about five times in the inner 2 kpc disk .",
    "2 .   in spite of the different sfe , radial sfe share similar trend of variation at the two sides .",
    "low sfe is seen in the radial range of the inner ( midway ) offset ridges , whereas , the ridge ends show high sfe .",
    "the variations of sfe agree with the prediction based on the effect of the dust - lane shocks and the increase in the probability of cloud - cloud collisions in high - interaction environment .",
