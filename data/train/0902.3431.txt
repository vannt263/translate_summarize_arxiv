    "the constraints used in the analysis can be distinguished in side and angle constraints , where the latter do not rely on theoretical calculations of hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the side constraints come from the measurement of direct cp - violation in the kaon sector ( @xmath9 ) , of @xmath3 and @xmath5 mixing ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and of semileptonic b decays ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the angle constraints are cp - violating measurements for the @xmath3-system , performed with high statistics at b - factories : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm_allconstr ] , the ckm matrix turns out to be consistently overconstraint .",
    "the ckm parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 result to be accurately determined : @xmath20 , @xmath21  @xcite . , @xmath22  @xcite . ]",
    "the ut analysis has thus established that the ckm matrix is the dominant source of flavour mixing and cp - violation and that new physics ( np ) effects can at most represent a small correction to this picture .",

    "the closed contours at @xmath23% and @xmath24% probability are shown .",
    "the full lines correspond to @xmath24% probability regions for the different constraints.__,title=\"fig : \" ] +    due to the redundant experimental constraints , interesting consistency checks can be performed by comparing various ut analyses where different constraints are used .",
    "in particular , the ut analyses based on only angle ( utangle ) or only side ( utside ) constraints , shown in fig .  [ fig : sm_anglevsside ] , provide well compatible results  @xcite : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath29 difference between the two @xmath18 results is mainly a manifestation of the tension of the @xmath30 inclusive measurement , based on heavy quark effective theory parameters extracted from experimental fits with some model dependence , with the rest of the fit and with the @xmath30 exclusive measurement , relying on semileptonic form factors determined from lattice qcd or qcd sum rules .",
    "in fact , the utangle analysis turns out provide an indirect determination of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) that is in perfect agreement with the @xmath30 exclusive measurement ( @xmath32 ) , while the utside analysis uses in input the inclusive - exclusive average for @xmath30 that is @xmath33 higher than the utangle indirect determination  @xcite .    -@xmath19 plane , including only angle ( left ) or side ( right ) measurements .",

    "this comparison is shown in table  [ tab : lattice ] for the hadronic parameters describing mixing in the @xmath1- , @xmath3- and @xmath5-meson sectors .",
    "the remarkable agreement between the lattice calculations and the indirect ut analysis determinations provides additional evidence of the sm success in describing flavour physics and of the reliability of lattice qcd calculations .",
