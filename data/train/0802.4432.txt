    "let @xmath0 be a complex manifold .",
    "a * foliation by curves * @xmath1 on @xmath0 is defined by a holomorphic line bundle @xmath2 on @xmath0 and a holomorphic linear morphism @xmath3 which is injective outside an analytic subset @xmath4 of codimension at least 2 , called the * singular set * of the foliation .",
    "equivalently , we have an open covering @xmath5 of @xmath0 and a collection of holomorphic vector fields @xmath6 , with zero set of codimension at least 2 , such that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a multiplicative cocycle defining the dual bundle @xmath9 , called the * canonical bundle * of @xmath10 .    these vector fields can be locally integrated , and by the relations above these local integral curves can be glued together ( without respecting the time parametrization ) , giving rise to the * leaves * of the foliation @xmath10 .    by the classical uniformisation theorem ,",
    "the universal covering of each leaf is either the unit disc @xmath11 ( hyperbolic leaf ) or the affine line @xmath12 ( parabolic leaf ) or the projective line @xmath13 ( rational leaf ) .    in these notes",
    "we shall assume that the ambient manifold @xmath0 is a compact connected khler manifold , and we will be concerned with the following problem : how the universal covering @xmath14 of the leaf @xmath15 through the point @xmath16 depends on @xmath16 ?",
    "for instance , we may first of all ask about the structure of the subset of @xmath0 formed by those points through which the leaf is hyperbolic , resp .",
    "parabolic , resp .",
    "rational : is the set of hyperbolic leaves open in @xmath0 ? is the set of parabolic leaves analytic ?",
    "but , even if all the leaves are , say , hyperbolic , there are further basic questions : the uniformising map of every leaf is almost unique ( unique modulo automorphisms of the disc ) , and after some normalization ( to get uniqueness ) we may ask about the way in which the uniformising map of @xmath15 depends on the point @xmath16 .",
    "equivalently , we may put on every leaf its poincar metric , and we may ask about the way in which this leafwise metric varies in the directions transverse to the foliation .    our main result will be that these universal coverings of leaves can be glued together in a vaguely `` holomorphically convex '' way .",
    "that is , the _ leafwise _ universal covering of the foliated manifold @xmath17 can be defined and it has a sort of `` holomorphically convex '' structure @xcite @xcite .",
    "this was inspired by a seminal work of ilyashenko @xcite @xcite , who proved a similar result when @xmath0 is a stein manifold instead of a compact khler one .",
    "related ideas can also be found in suzuki s paper @xcite , still in the stein case .",
    "another source of inspiration was shafarevich conjecture on the holomorphic convexity of universal coverings of projective ( or compact khler ) manifolds @xcite .",
    "this main result will allow us to apply results by nishino @xcite and yamaguchi @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite concerning the transverse variation of the leafwise poincar metric and other analytic invariants . as a consequence of this , for instance",
    ", we shall obtain that if the foliation has at least one hyperbolic leaf , then : ( 1 ) there are no rational leaves ; ( 2 ) parabolic leaves fill a subset of @xmath0 which is _ complete pluripolar _",
    ", i.e. locally given by the poles of a plurisubharmonic function . in other words , the set of hyperbolic leaves of @xmath1 is either empty or potential - theoretically full in @xmath0 .",
    "these results are related also to positivity properties of the canonical bundle @xmath18 , along a tradition opened by arakelov @xcite @xcite in the case of algebraic fibrations by curves and developed by miyaoka @xcite @xcite and then mcquillan and bogomolov @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite in the case of foliations on projective manifolds . from this point of view , our final result is the following ruledness criterion for foliations :    [ main ] @xcite @xcite let @xmath0 be a compact connected khler manifold and let @xmath1 be a foliation by curves on @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that the canonical bundle @xmath19 is not pseudoeffective .",
    "then through every point @xmath20 there exists a rational curve tangent to @xmath10 .",
    "recall that a line bundle on a compact connected manifold is _ pseudoeffective _ if it admits a ( singular ) hermitian metric with positive curvature in the sense of currents @xcite .",
    "when @xmath0 is projective the above theorem follows also from results of @xcite and @xcite , but with a totally different proof , untranslatable in our khler context .",
    "let us now describe in more detail the content of these notes .",
    "in section 2 we shall recall the results by nishino and yamaguchi on stein fibrations that we shall use later , and also some of ilyashenko s results . in section 3 and 4",
    "we construct the leafwise universal covering of @xmath17 : we give an appropriate definition of leaf @xmath15 of @xmath10 through a point @xmath21 ( this requires some care , because some leaves are allowed to pass through some singular points ) , and we show that the universal coverings @xmath14 can be glued together to get a complex manifold . in section 5",
    "we prove that the complex manifold so constructed enjoys some `` holomorphic convexity '' property .",
    "this is used in section 6 and 8 , together with nishino and yamaguchi results , to prove ( among other things ) theorem [ main ] above .",
    "the parabolic case requires also an extension theorem for certain meromorphic maps into compact khler manifolds , which is proved in section 7 .",
    "all this work has been developed in our previous papers @xcite @xcite @xcite and @xcite ( with few imprecisions which will be corrected here ) .",
    "further results and application can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in a series of papers , nishino @xcite and then yamaguchi @xcite @xcite @xcite studied the following situation . it is given a stein manifold @xmath22 , of dimension @xmath23 , equipped with a holomorphic submersion @xmath24 with connected fibers .",
    "each fiber @xmath25 is thus a smooth connected curve , and as such it has several potential theoretic invariants ( green functions , bergman kernels , harmonic moduli ... ) .",
    "one is interested in knowing how these invariants vary with @xmath26 , and then in using this knowledge to obtain some information on the structure of @xmath22 .    for our purposes ,",
    "the last step in this program has been carried out by kizuka @xcite , in the following form .",
    "[ kizuka ] @xcite @xcite @xcite if @xmath22 is stein , then the fiberwise poincar metric on @xmath27 has a plurisubharmonic variation .",
    "this means the following . on each fiber @xmath25 , @xmath28",
    ", we put its poincar metric , i.e. the ( unique ) complete hermitian metric of curvature @xmath29 if @xmath25 is uniformised by @xmath30 , or the identically zero `` metric '' if @xmath25 is uniformised by @xmath31 ( @xmath22 being stein , there are no other possibilities ) .",
    "if @xmath32 is a holomorphic nonvanishing vector field , defined in some open subset @xmath33 and tangent to the fibers of @xmath34 , then we can take the function on @xmath35 @xmath36 where , for every @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the norm of @xmath39 evaluated with the poincar metric on @xmath40 .",
    "the statement above means that , whatever @xmath32 is , the function @xmath41 is _ plurisubharmonic _ , or identically @xmath42 if all the fibers are parabolic .",
    "note that if we replace @xmath32 by @xmath43 , with @xmath44 a holomorphic nonvanishing function on @xmath35 , then @xmath41 is replaced by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is pluriharmonic . a more intrinsic way to state",
    "this property is : the fiberwise poincar metric ( if not identically zero ) defines on the relative canonical bundle of @xmath27 a hermitian metric ( possibly singular ) whose curvature is a _ positive current",
    "note also that the plurisubharmonicity of @xmath41 along the fibers is just a restatement of the negativity of the curvature of the poincar metric .",
    "the important fact here is the plurisubharmonicity along the directions transverse to the fibers , whence the _ variation _ terminology .",
    "remark that the poles of @xmath41 correspond exactly to parabolic fibers of @xmath22 .",
    "we therefore obtain the following dichotomy : either all the fibers are parabolic ( @xmath47 ) , or the parabolic fibers correspond to a complete pluripolar subset of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the theorem above is a generalization of , and was motivated by , a classical result of hartogs ( * ? ? ? *",
    "ii.5 ) , asserting ( in modern language ) that a domain @xmath22 in @xmath50 of the form ( hartogs tube ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an upper semicontinuous function , is stein if and only if @xmath53 is plurisubharmonic . indeed ,",
    "in this special case the poincar metric is easily computed , and one checks that the plurisubharmonicity of @xmath53 is equivalent to the plurisubharmonic variation of the fiberwise poincar metric .",
    "this special case suggests also that some converse statement to theorem [ kizuka ] could be true .",
    "we give the proof of theorem [ kizuka ] only in a particular case , which is anyway the only case that we shall actually use .",
    "we start with a fibration @xmath24 as above , but without assuming @xmath22 stein .",
    "we consider an open subset @xmath54 such that :    1 .   for every @xmath55 ,",
    "the intersection @xmath56 is a disc , relatively compact in the fiber @xmath25 ; 2 .",
    "the boundary @xmath57 is real analytic and transverse to the fibers of @xmath34 ; 3 .",
    "the boundary @xmath57 is pseudoconvex in @xmath22 .",
    "then we restrict our attention to the fibration by discs @xmath58 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath59 is stein , but this fact will not really be used below .",
    "[ yamaguchi ] @xcite @xcite the fiberwise poincar metric on @xmath60 has a plurisubharmonic variation .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the case @xmath61 .",
    "the statement is local on the base , and for every @xmath62 we can embed a neighbourhood of @xmath63 in @xmath22 into @xmath64 in such a way that @xmath34 becomes the projection to the first coordinate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus we may assume that @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is a disc in @xmath68 , with real analytic boundary , depending on @xmath26 in a real analytic and pseudoconvex way .",
    "take a holomorphic section @xmath69 and a holomorphic vertical vector field @xmath32 along @xmath70 , i.e. for every @xmath71 , @xmath72 is a vector in @xmath73 tangent to the fiber over @xmath26 ( and nonvanishing ) .",
    "we need to prove that @xmath74 is a subharmonic function on @xmath30 . by another change of coordinates",
    ", we may assume that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "for every @xmath26 , let @xmath77\\ ] ] be the green function of @xmath78 with pole at @xmath79 .",
    "that is , @xmath80 is harmonic on @xmath81 , zero on @xmath82 , and around @xmath83 it has the development @xmath84 the constant @xmath85 ( robin constant ) is related to the poincar metric of @xmath78 : more precisely , we have @xmath86 ( indeed , recall that the green function gives the radial part of a uniformisation of @xmath78 ) .",
    "hence , we are reduced to show that @xmath87 is _ super_harmonic .",
    "fix @xmath88 . by real analyticity of @xmath57 ,",
    "the function @xmath44 is ( outside the poles ) also real analytic , and thus extensible ( in a real analytic way ) beyond @xmath57 .",
    "this means that if @xmath26 is sufficiently close to @xmath89 , then @xmath80 is actually defined on @xmath90 , and harmonic on @xmath91 .",
    "of course , @xmath80 does not need to vanish on @xmath92 .",
    "the difference @xmath93 is harmonic on @xmath94 ( the poles annihilate ) , equal to @xmath95 at @xmath79 , and equal to @xmath80 on @xmath92 . by green formula : @xmath96 and consequently : @xmath97    we now compute the @xmath26-laplacian of @xmath98 when @xmath99 is a point of the boundary @xmath92 .",
    "the function @xmath100 is , around @xmath101 , a defining function for @xmath59 . by pseudoconvexity ,",
    "the levi form of @xmath44 at @xmath101 is therefore nonpositive on the complex tangent space @xmath102 ,",
    "i.e. on the kernel of @xmath103 at @xmath101 ( * ? ?",
    "* ii.2 ) . by developing , and using also the fact that @xmath44 is @xmath104-harmonic",
    ", we obtain @xmath105    we put this inequality into the expression of @xmath106 derived above from green formula , and then we apply stokes theorem .",
    "we find @xmath107 from which we see that @xmath108 is superharmonic .",
    "a similar result can be proved , by the same proof , even when we drop the simply connectedness hypothesis on the fibers , for instance when the fibers of @xmath59 are annuli instead of discs ; however , the result is that the bergman fiberwise metric , and not the poincar one , has a plurisubharmonic variation .",
    "this is because on a multiply connected curve the green function is more directly related to the bergman metric @xcite .",
    "the case of the poincar metric is done in @xcite , by a covering argument .",
    "the general case of theorem [ kizuka ] requires also to understand what happens when @xmath109 is still pseudoconvex but no more transverse to the fibers , so that @xmath59 is no more a differentiably trivial family of curves .",
    "this is rather delicate , and it is done in @xcite",
    ". then theorem [ kizuka ] is proved by an exhaustion argument .",
    "theorem [ kizuka ] , as stated , is rather empty when all the fibers are isomorphic to @xmath31 .",
    "however , in that case nishino proved that if @xmath22 is stein then it is isomorphic to @xmath110 ( * ? ? ? *",
    "a refinement of this was found in @xcite .    as before",
    ", we consider a fibration @xmath24 and we do not assume that @xmath22 is stein .",
    "we suppose that there exists an embedding @xmath111 such that @xmath112 coincides with the projection from @xmath113 to @xmath48 ( this can always be done , up to restricting the base ) . for every @xmath114",
    ", we set @xmath115 with @xmath116 , and we denote by @xmath117 the restriction of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the fibers of @xmath118 are obtained from those of @xmath34 by removing a closed disc ( if @xmath119 ) or a point ( if @xmath120 ) .",

    "has a plurisubharmonic variation .",

    "* ii ) , koebe s theorem gives also the continuity of the above map @xmath53 .    on the fibers of @xmath133 , which are all isomorphic to @xmath134",

    "a simple and explicit computation , the poincar metric on @xmath138 multiplied by @xmath136 converges uniformly to the flat metric of period @xmath135 on @xmath139 , as @xmath140 . using this and the above bounds on @xmath141",
    ", we obtain that our fiberwise metric on @xmath142 converges uniformly , as @xmath140 , to our fiberwise metric on @xmath143 ( see @xcite for more explicit computations ) .",
    "hence , from the plurisubharmonic variation of the former we deduce the plurisubharmonic variation of the latter .",
    "our flat metric on @xmath144 is the pull - back by @xmath127 of the metric @xmath145 on @xmath146 . in the coordinates given by @xmath124",
    ", we have @xmath147 with @xmath44 holomorphic in @xmath104 and @xmath148 for every @xmath26 , by the choice of the normalization .",

    ", by the previous arguments , that @xmath41 is plurisubharmonic .",
    "moreover , @xmath151 , by flatness of the metric . by semipositivity of the levi form",
    "we then obtain @xmath152 for every @xmath130 .",
    "hence the function @xmath153 is holomorphic , that is the function @xmath154 is holomorphic .",
    "taking into account that @xmath155 , we obtain from this that @xmath44 also is fully holomorphic . thus @xmath53 is fully holomorphic in the chart given by @xmath124 , and hence everywhere .",
    "it follows that @xmath22 is isomorphic to a product .",
    "remark that if @xmath22 is stein then the hypothesis on the plurisubharmonic variation is automatically satisfied , by theorem [ kizuka ] , and because if @xmath22 is stein then also @xmath156 are stein , for every @xmath131 .",
    "that was the situation originally considered by nishino and yamaguchi .",
    "a standard illustration of theorem [ nishino ] is the following one .",

    "we have in this way defined a map @xmath1466 , @xmath1467 , which obviously is an isomorphism , sending the origin of @xmath1468 to the basepoint of @xmath14 . in other words : because @xmath15 is parabolic , we have a canonically defined isomorphism between @xmath1469 and @xmath1470 .",
    "by varying @xmath16 in @xmath476 we thus have a map @xmath1471 sending @xmath1432 to the null section , and we need to verify that this map is _",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath1420 ( and @xmath1456 also , of course ) is a locally trivial fibration . in terms of the previous construction ,",
    "we take a local transversal @xmath590 and a nowhere vanishing holomorphic section @xmath1458 , @xmath1102 , of @xmath1456 over @xmath184 .",
    "the previous construction gives a vertical vector field @xmath1462 on @xmath173 , which is , on every fiber , complete holomorphic and nowhere vanishing , and moreover it is holomorphic along @xmath711 . after a trivialization @xmath1472 , sending @xmath720 to @xmath1473 , this vertical vector field @xmath1462 becomes something like @xmath1474 , with @xmath41 nowhere vanishing , @xmath1475 holomorphic for every fixed @xmath26 , and @xmath1476 also holomorphic .",
    "the completeness on fibers gives that @xmath41 is in fact _ constant _ on every fiber , i.e. @xmath1477 , and so @xmath41 is in fact fully holomorphic .",
    "thus @xmath1462 is fully holomorphic on the tube .",
    "this means precisely that the above map @xmath1478 is holomorphic .",
    "[ complete ] consider a foliation @xmath164 generated by a global holomorphic vector field @xmath1479 , vanishing precisely on @xmath505 .",
    "this means that @xmath549 is the trivial line bundle , and @xmath1480 .",
    "the compactness of @xmath0 permits to define the _ flow _ of @xmath32 @xmath1481 which sends @xmath1482 to the orbit of @xmath32 through @xmath16 , that is to @xmath473 if @xmath472 or to @xmath1483 if @xmath1484 .",
    "recalling that @xmath735 for a generic leaf , and observing that every @xmath473 is obviously parabolic , we see that @xmath164 is a parabolic foliation .",
    "it is also not difficult to see that , in fact , @xmath735 for every leaf , i.e. there are no vanishing ends , and so the map @xmath1485 is everywhere holomorphic , with values in @xmath476 .",
    "we have @xmath1486 ( by theorem [ trivialtube ] , which is however quite trivial in this special case ) , and the map @xmath1487 can be identified with the restricted flow @xmath1488 .    [ canonicalnef ] it is a general fact @xcite that vanishing ends of a foliation @xmath164 produce rational curves in @xmath0 over which the canonical bundle @xmath18 has negative degree .",
    "in particular , if @xmath18 is algebraically nef ( i.e. @xmath1489 for every compact curve @xmath1490 ) then @xmath164 has no vanishing end .",
    "we shall say that a foliation by curves @xmath164 is a * foliation by rational curves * if for every @xmath472 there exists a rational curve @xmath1491 passing through @xmath16 and tangent to @xmath164 .",
    "this class of foliations should not be confused with the smaller class of rational quasi - fibrations : certainly a rational quasi - fibration is a foliation by rational curves , but the converse is in general false , because the above rational curves @xmath1492 can pass through @xmath505 and so @xmath15 ( which is equal to @xmath1492 minus those points of @xmath1493 not corresponding to vanishing ends ) can be parabolic or even hyperbolic",
    ". thus the class of foliations by rational curves is transversal to our fundamental trichotomy rational quasi - fibrations / parabolic foliations / hyperbolic foliations .",
    "a typical example is the radial foliation in the projective space @xmath1494 , i.e. the foliation generated ( in an affine chart ) by the radial vector field @xmath1495 : it is a foliation by rational curves , but it is parabolic . on the other hand , it is a standard exercise in bimeromorphic geometry to see that any foliation by rational curves can be transformed , by a bimeromorphic map , into a rational quasi - fibration .",
    "for instance , the radial foliation above can be transformed into a rational quasi - fibration , and even into a @xmath449-bundle , by blowing - up the origin .",
    "we have seen in section 6 that the canonical bundle @xmath18 of a hyperbolic foliation is always pseudoeffective . at the opposite side , for a rational quasi - fibration @xmath18",
    "is never pseudoeffective : its degree on a generic leaf ( a smooth rational curve disjoint from @xmath505 ) is equal to @xmath1496 , and this prevents pseudoeffectivity . for parabolic foliations , the situation is mixed : the radial foliation in @xmath1494 has canonical bundle equal to @xmath1497 , which is not pseudoeffective ; a foliation like in example [ complete ] has trivial canonical bundle , which is pseudoeffective .",
    "one can also easily find examples of parabolic foliations with ample canonical bundle , for instance most foliations arising from complete polynomial vector fields in @xmath1498 @xcite .",
    "[ parabolic ] let @xmath164 be a parabolic foliation on a compact connected khler manifold @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that its canonical bundle @xmath18 is not pseudoeffective .",
    "then @xmath164 is a foliation by rational curves .",
    "consider the meromorphic map @xmath1499 given by theorem [ trivialtube ] .",
    "because @xmath1500 has codimension at least two , such a map meromorphically extends @xcite to the full space @xmath1456 : @xmath1501    the section at infinity of @xmath1456 is the same as the null section of @xmath1502 , the total space of @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath18 is not pseudoeffective , then by theorem [ extension ] @xmath1503 extends to the full @xmath1504 section at @xmath1505 , as a meromorphic map @xmath1506      note that the converse to this theorem is not always true : for instance , a parabolic foliation like in example [ complete ] has trivial ( pseudoeffective ) canonical bundle , yet it can be a foliation by rational curves , for some special @xmath32 .",
    "suppose that @xmath164 is a fibration over some base @xmath352 , i.e. there exists a holomorphic map @xmath1509 whose generic fiber is a leaf of @xmath164 ( but there may be singular fibers , and even some higher dimensional fibers ) .",
    "let @xmath44 be the genus of a generic fiber , and suppose that @xmath1510 .",
    "the relative canonical bundle of @xmath53 is defined as @xmath1511 it is related to the canonical bundle @xmath18 of @xmath163 by the relation @xmath1512 where @xmath374 is an _ effective _ divisor which takes into account the possible ramifications of @xmath53 along nongeneric fibers .",
    "indeed , by adjunction along the leaves , we have @xmath1513 , where @xmath1514 denotes the determinant conormal bundle of @xmath164 .",
    "if @xmath398 is a local generator of @xmath1515 , then @xmath401 is a local section of @xmath1516 which vanishes along the ramification divisor @xmath374 of @xmath53 , hence @xmath1517 , whence the relation above .    because @xmath164 is not a foliation by rational curves , we have , by the theorems above , that @xmath18 is pseudoeffective , and therefore also @xmath1518 is pseudoeffective . in particular , @xmath1519 and @xmath1520 are `` pseudoeffective sheaves '' on @xmath352 , in the sense that their degrees with respect to khler metrics on @xmath352 are nonnegative .",
    "this must be compared with arakelov s positivity theorem @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "but , as in arakelov s results , something more can be said .",
    "suppose that @xmath352 is a curve ( or restrict the fibration @xmath53 over some curve in @xmath352 ) and let us distinguish between the hyperbolic and the parabolic case .",
    "@xmath1521 @xmath1522 .",
    "then the pseudoeffectivity of @xmath18 is realized by the leafwise poincar metric ( theorem [ hyperbolic ] ) .",
    "a subtle computation @xcite @xcite shows that this leafwise ( or fiberwise ) poincar metric has a _ strictly _ plurisubharmonic variation , unless the fibration is isotrivial .",
    "this means that if @xmath53 is _ not _ isotrivial then the degree of @xmath1519 ( and , a fortiori , the degree of @xmath1520 ) is _ strictly positive_.    @xmath1521 @xmath1523 .",
    "we put on every smooth elliptic leaf of @xmath163 the ( unique ) flat metric with total area 1 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite ( using theorem [ trivialtube ] above ) that this leafwise metric extends to a metric on @xmath18 with positive curvature . in other words ,",
    "the pseudoeffectivity of @xmath18 is realized by a leafwise flat metric .",
    "moreover , still in @xcite it is observed that if the fibration is not isotrivial then the curvature of such a metric on @xmath18 is strictly positive on directions transverse to the fibration .",
    "we thus get the same conclusion as in the hyperbolic case : if @xmath53 is _ not _ isotrivial then the degree of @xmath1519 ( and , a fortiori , the degree of @xmath1520 ) is _ strictly positive_.      in the case of hyperbolic foliations , theorem [ hyperbolic ] is very efficient : not only @xmath18 is pseudoeffective , but even this pseudoeffectivity is realized by an explicit metric , induced by the leafwise poincar metric .",
    "this gives further useful properties .",
    "for instance , we have seen that the polar set of the metric is filled by singularities and parabolic leaves .",
    "hence , for example , if all the leaves are hyperbolic and the singularities are isolated , then @xmath18 is not only pseudoeffective but even nef ( numerically eventually free @xcite ) .",
    "this efficiency is unfortunately lost in the case of parabolic foliations , because in theorem [ parabolic ] the pseudoeffectivity of @xmath18 is obtained via a more abstract argument . in particular , we do not know how to control the polar set of the metric .",
    "see , however , @xcite for some special cases in which a distinguished metric on @xmath18 can be constructed even in the parabolic case , besides the case of elliptic fibrations discussed in example [ fibrations ] above .    according to general principles @xcite , once we know that @xmath18 is pseudoeffective we should try to understand its discrepancy from being nef . there is on @xmath0 a unique maximal countable collection of compact analytic subsets @xmath1524 such that @xmath1525 is _ not _ pseudoeffective .",
    "it seems reasonable to try to develop the above theory in a `` relative '' context , by replacing @xmath0 with @xmath1526 , and then to prove something like this : every @xmath1526 is @xmath164-invariant , and the restriction of @xmath164 to @xmath1526 is a foliation by rational curves .",
    "note , however , that the restriction of a foliation to an invariant analytic subspace @xmath741 is a dangerous operation .",
    "usually , we like to work with `` saturated '' foliations , i.e. with a singular set of codimension at least two ( see , e.g. , the beginning of the proof of theorem [ parabolic ] for the usefulness of this condition ) .",
    "if @xmath1527 has codimension one in @xmath741 , this means that our `` restriction of @xmath164 to @xmath741 '' is not really @xmath1528 , but rather its saturation .",
    "consequently , the canonical bundle of that restriction is not really @xmath1529 , but rather @xmath1530 , where @xmath1531 is an effective divisor supported in @xmath321 .",
    "if @xmath1532 has codimension zero in @xmath741 ( i.e. , @xmath1533 ) , the situation is even worst , because then there is not a really well defined notion of restriction to @xmath741 .",
    "the previous remark is evidently related to the problem of constructing minimal models of foliations by curves , i.e. birational models ( on possibly singular varieties ) for which the canonical bundle is nef . in the projective context",
    ", results in this direction have been obtained by mcquillan and bogomolov @xcite @xcite . from this birational point of view",
    ", however , we rapidly meet another open and difficult problem : the resolution of the singularities of @xmath164 .",
    "a related problem is the construction of birational models for which there are no vanishing ends in the leaves , compare with remark [ canonicalnef ] above .",
    "finally , the pseudoeffectivity of @xmath18 may be measured by finer invariants , like kodaira dimension or numerical kodaira dimension .",
    "when @xmath753 then the picture is rather clear and complete @xcite @xcite .",
    "when @xmath1534 then almost everything seems open ( see , however , the case of fibrations discussed above ) . note that already in dimension two the so - called `` abundance '' does not hold : there are foliations ( hilbert modular foliations @xcite @xcite ) whose canonical bundle is pseudoeffective , yet its kodaira dimension is @xmath42 .",
