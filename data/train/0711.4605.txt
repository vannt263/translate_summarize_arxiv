    "the connection between star formation studied in the milky way and in galaxies is important for understanding the global evolution of stars in the universe .",
    "lessons learned locally , where angular resolution permits detailed studies of high - mass star forming regions , may be applied to star formation regions that are unresolved in other galaxies .",
    "star formation occurs in dense molecular gas ( evans 1999 ) ; therefore , it is necessary to study the properties of dense molecular gas to understand the conditions in the material actively involved in forming protostars .",
    "an important aspect of this study is the efficiency of star formation or how effectively dense gas is converted into stars .",
    "one method for determining the star formation efficiency in milky way molecular clouds is to calculate the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the mass of a star - forming clump within a giant molecular cloud ( @xmath2 ) . within high - mass star forming regions in the milky way",
    ", submillimeter single - dish telescopes can resolve individual cluster - forming clumps ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "higher resolution interferometric observations resolve the clumps into individual star - forming cores ( e.g. brogan et al .",
    "only a few high - mass clumps have been observed at high resolution . since",
    "several systematic single - dish surveys of clumps have been made ( e.g. , plume et al .",
    "1997 ; zinchenko et al .",
    "2000 ; sridharan et al . 2002 ) , we focus on the properties of the cluster - forming clumps . if we assume a universal stellar initial mass function ( imf ) for all star - forming regions within the milky way , then the bolometric luminosity is directly proportion to the star formation rate ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the virial mass of a molecular clump is calculated from @xmath5 where r is the size of the clump , @xmath6 is the fwhm linewidth , @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 ) is the correction factor for a power - law density of the form @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the correction factor for an ellipsoidal shape ( bertoldi & mckee 1989 ) . the size and shape are determined from the fwhm intensity contour of the clump ( see shirley et al .",
    "an optically thin linewidth must be determined from observations of isotopomers ( e.g. h@xmath11cn , c@xmath12s , h@xmath11co@xmath13 ) since the linewidth of common dense gas tracers can be significantly broadened due to large optical depths ( philips et al . 1979 ) .",
    "radiative transfer modeling of optically thin dust continuum emission indicates that the average large scale structure of dense molecular clumps follows a single power - law density @xmath9 ( mueller et al .",
    "2002 ; williams et al .",
    "2005 ) , for which the correction to @xmath14 can be substantial ( @xmath15 for a @xmath16 power - law ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath17 versus @xmath14 is plotted in figure 1 for mapping surveys of cs j=2 - 1 and j=5 - 4 ( wu et al .",
    "2008 , in prep . ; plume et al . 1992 ; shirley et al .",
    "2003 ) , hcn j=3 - 2 ( wu & evans 2005 ) , and hco@xmath13 j=3 - 2 ( shirley et al . 2008 , in prep . ) .",
    "all of these dense gas tracers display a remarkable lack of correlation .",
    "when all of these tracers are considered together , this result is consistent with a constant sfr per unit mass of dense gas .",
    "the average star forming efficiency traced by dense gas is constant among high - mass star forming regions in the milky way and this result appears to be independent of the dense gas tracer observed ( bottom panel , figure 1 ) .",
    "the critical density of a transition ( @xmath18 ) is crude approximation for determining the density at which a particular transition is excited . in reality , radiative transfer effects can significantly lower the density at which a particular line may be easily detected ( @xmath19 ) by up to an order of magnitude ( see evans 1999 ) .",
    "the observed @xmath20 is nearly constant for all tracers with @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the result from molecular line observations is confirmed by making @xmath23 comparisons from dust continuum observations .",
    "since the dust emission on large scales is optically thin at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths , the dust mass may be calculated with assumptions of the average dust temperature and the dust opacity ( hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "for instance , the @xmath24@xmath25 m radiative transfer modeling survey of mueller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find a constant @xmath26 that is within a factor of two of the @xmath27 calculated from dense molecular gas ( shirley et al .",
    "a factor of two is within the uncertainty in dust opacity at long wavelengths in high - mass star forming regions .",
    "thus , there is strong evidence that , regardless of tracer , the sfr / m is constant in dense molecular gas within the milky way .",
    "observations of other galaxies are not currently able to resolve individual cluster - forming molecular clumps ; since we can not calculate @xmath14 directly , we must instead interpret global averages of the molecular luminosity . as a result , we calculate @xmath28 , or the source - integrated surface brightness @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the luminosity distance and @xmath31 is the rest frequency ( see mangum et al .",
    "2007 for a derivation ; solomon et al . 1997 ) . the physical conditions in molecular gas may be probed by comparison of @xmath28 for tracers with the same spatial extent .",
    "recent extragalactic surveys have found very strong correlations between the globally integrated @xmath28 and the galactic infrared luminosity ( @xmath0 , @xmath32 $ ] @xmath25 m ) .",
    "the hcn 1 - 0 survey of gao & solomon ( 2004a , b ) found a remarkable , tight linear correlation between @xmath28(hcn1 - 0 ) and @xmath0 over three orders of magnitude in @xmath0 .",
    "this relationship is significantly different from the super - linear correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath0 observed for co 1 - 0 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "linear correlations are also observed in other dense gas tracers including co j=3 - 2 ( narayanan et al . 2005 ) , hnc j=1 - 0 , hco@xmath13 j=1 - 0 , and cn n=1 - 0 and n=2 - 1 ( baan et al .",
    "2007 ; see figure 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , the extragalactic linear hcn @xmath33 correlation directly extends , without an offset , to @xmath28 versus @xmath0 for galactic high - mass star - forming clumps ( wu et al . 2005 ) . if @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then the linear correlation would indicate that the sfr in dense molecular gas is also constant in other star - forming galaxies ( @xmath36 constant , analogous with the galactic @xmath37 constant result ) .",
    "one interpretation of these results is that the general star formation law in other galaxies is a simple extension of the constant sfr / m observed in the milky way with the dense molecular clumps greater than a few hundred m@xmath38 comprising a fundamental unit of star formation ( see wu et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this interpretation ,",
    "the main difference between the milky way and an extreme starburst galaxy is that the a larger fraction of the molecular ism is in a dense molecular phase in the the starburst galaxy compared to the milky way .",
    "observationally , a larger ratio of hcn to co 1 - 0 emission is observed with larger @xmath0 ( gao & solomon 2004b ; see figure 2 ) possibly indicating a higher dense gas fraction in more luminous galaxies ( cf .",
    "riechers et al .",
    "2007 for a flattening of the ratio for high z galaxies ) .",
    "there are several caveats to the constant sfr / m interpretation .",
    "l@xmath1 is determined globally and contains contributions from both low density and high density molecular gas with a wide range of excitation conditions along each line - of - sight .",
    "@xmath28 may not be linearly proportional to mass ; therefore , proper interpretation of l@xmath1 may required radiative transfer modeling of excitation conditions in gas on galactic scales .",
    "the observational study of mangum et al .",
    "( 2007 ) attempts to circumvent this problem by calculated the total molecular mass from lvg models of the absorption spectra of the centimeter k - doublet h@xmath39co transitions .",
    "this pilot survey detected more than a dozen galaxies and was able to determine the @xmath40 ratio globally for an assumed formaldehyde abundance .",
    "the considerable scatter precludes strong conclusions , but the observed relationship may be consistent with a constant sfr / m ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "theoretical calculations of @xmath28 must couple galactic hydrodynamics with radiative transfer .",
    "two initial studies have provided an alternative explanation to the observed linear correlations for @xmath28(hcn1 - 0 ) and @xmath0 and the super - linear correlation of @xmath28(co1 - 0 ) and @xmath0 .",
    "krumholz & thompson ( 2007 ) model the radiative transfer for an ensemble of clumps with a lognormal distribution in density , as expected from turbulent ism simulations , and a sfr @xmath41 based upon free - fall arguments .",
    "they find that the slope of the @xmath0 versus @xmath28 correlation depends on whether the mean density of the gas is above or below the critical density of the tracer : @xmath0 correlates super - linearly with @xmath28 if @xmath42 while @xmath0 correlates linearly with @xmath28 if @xmath43 .",
    "similar results were found with the more sophisticated 3d coupled hydrodynamic - radiative transfer models of narayanan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with the main difference being that narayanan et al .",
    "also predict sub - linear correlations for the higher @xmath44 transitions of dense molecular gas tracers ( e.g. hcn 3 - 2 ) .",
    "this theoretical prediction is testable by current extragalactic surveys of higher excitation lines of hcn and hco@xmath13 ( e.g. , padelis et al .",
    "2007 ; hht survey of bussmann et al .",
    "2008 , in prep . ) . in both sets of models , @xmath28(hcn 1 - 0 )",
    "is significantly affected by sub - thermal excitation of large quantities of low density gas along lines - of - sight through the galaxy .",
    "thus , the naive assumption that @xmath28 faithfully traces mass may be incorrect .",
    "furthermore , both of these model assume an underlying star formation law that is similar to the kennicutt - schmidt law of @xmath45 ( kennicutt 1998 ; kennicutt et al .",
    "2007 ) and not a constant @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath28 may also be affected by the chemical or excitation effects on the dense molecular gas via processes not related to star formation such as the effects from an agn ( see combes 2007 for a chemical review ) .",
    "agn generate a substantial infrared radiation field that may contribute to @xmath0 ( violating the @xmath47 sfr assumption ) and also may enhance ( sub)millimeter molecular transitions through absorption of ir photons in mid - infrared vibrational bands ( e.g. , the @xmath48@xmath25 m bending mode of hnc ; aalto et al . 2007 ) .",
    "active agns generate harder x - ray radiation fields ( x - ray dominated regions , xdrs ) than star forming regions and may effect global ionization balance and the chemistry in dense molecular gas .",
    "for instance , a purported chemical trend has been observed in the ratio of hcn to hco@xmath13 emission versus the ratio of hcn to co emission that may be due to the effects of agn ( see figure 2 ; graci - carpio et al .",
    "2007 ; bann et al . 2007 ) .",
    "comparison of the properties of the galaxies with these higher molecular ratios tend to have evidence for strong agn activity ( either via optical , x - ray , or megamaser identification ) . in one case ,",
    "the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 was imaged with an interferometer and an enhancement in the hcn to co ratio is seen toward the central molecular torus ( krips et al .",
    "great care must be taken in the interpretation of these results since theoretical prediction of the abundances in xdrs is inchoate ( e.g. lintott et al .",
    "2006 ; cf .",
    "meijerink et al .",
    "multi - transition interferometric studies with spatially resolved sed modeling are needed to fully understand the excitation and abundance effects of the agn on @xmath0 and @xmath28 .",
    "galactic observations indicate that the sfr per unit mass traced by dense molecular transitions is constant , independent of tracer above @xmath21 @xmath22 . in contrast",
    ", extragalactic observations of hi , co , and optical and near - infrared emission lines indicate that the sfr follows a super - linear schmidt - kennicutt law with @xmath49 .",
    "recent radiative transfer models of molecular emission on galactic scales indicate that the observed linear correlations observed between @xmath0 and @xmath28 for dense gas tracers may be related to an underlying schmidt - kennicutt law .",
    "indeed , within the milky way , accounting of the gas content ( hi + co ) and cluster populations within 1 kpc of the sun reveal that the schmidt - kennicutt relationship predicts the observed star formation surface density ( evans 2007 ) .",
    "how do we reconcile the two possibilities for the sfr law ( constant vs. super - linear or both ) ? in the absence of direct observations of molecular clumps in other galaxies , the problem presents a difficult theoretical hydrodynamic - radiative transfer challenge which we have only begun to explore . within the milky way , it is still a theoretical challenge to understand which process mitigate the observed constant sfr / m in dense gas ( see article by mac low in this volume ) . on galactic scales ,",
    "one intriguing possibility is that the local schmidt - kennicutt law may flatten at high densities such that the sfr @xmath50 .",
    "this possibility should be explored theoretically . also ,",
    "observation of higher excitation lines at high spatial resolution with interferometers ( e.g. , pdbi , carma , and alma ) are needed to resolve issues of excitation and abundance variations within galaxies .",
    "the synthesis of current observational and theoretical studies of dense molecular gas in the milky way and other galaxies is beginning to reveal the global properties of star formation in the gas that is actively involved in star formation .",
