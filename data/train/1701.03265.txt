    "<S> the surface states of three - dimensional topological insulators posses the unique property of spin - momentum interlocking . </S>",
    "<S> this property gives rise to the interesting inverse edelstein effect ( iee ) , in which an applied spin bias @xmath0 is converted to a measurable charge voltage difference @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a semiclassical theory for the iee of the surface states of @xmath2 thin films , which is applicable from the ballistic regime to diffusive regime . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the iee efficiency ratio @xmath3 exhibits universal dependence on sample size , and approaches @xmath4 in the ballistic limit and @xmath5 in the diffusive limit .    </S>",
    "<S> [ 1 ]    spintronics has been a rapidly growing field of research in the past two decades because of its potential applications in memory , logic , and sensing devices , which utilize both spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons  @xcite . among the major tasks in spintronics , electrical detection of spin current and spin bias </S>",
    "<S> remains to be challenging . </S>",
    "<S> one method is to use the inverse spin hall effect ( ishe ) , in which a pure spin current generates a measurable transverse charge current  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the ishe has been widely employed in spintronic experiments  @xcite , the electrical signal generated is usually small , e.g. , the spin hall angle @xmath6 in pt  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another method that has been attracting increasing interest is the inverse edelstein effect ( iee )  @xcite , in which spin injection induces nonequilibrium spin polarization and in turn generates a charge current in the longitudinal direction . </S>",
    "<S> the iee has been observed in bi  @xcite , which was attributed to the rashba spin - orbit coupling on the interface .    </S>",
    "<S> topological insulators ( tis )  @xcite and topological kondo insulators ( tkis )  @xcite are a new quantum state of matter . </S>",
    "<S> a three - dimensional ( 3d ) ti has a bulk insulating gap with gapless surface states , which are protected from impurity backscattering by nontrivial bulk band topology and time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the topological surface states posses the unique property of spin - momentum locking  @xcite , which are promising for applications in spintronic devices  @xcite . in 2014 , </S>",
    "<S> large iee was realized in bulk insulating tis @xmath7 and sn - doped @xmath8  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which was interpreted as a result of the spin - momentum locking of the topological surface states . </S>",
    "<S> recently , in another experimental work  @xcite , the iee was observed on the surface of tki @xmath9 . by using a landauer - bttiker like formula </S>",
    "<S> , luo @xmath10 @xmath11 theoretically studied the iee of the surface states in the ballistic regime , and predicted that a spin bias polarized in the @xmath12 direction can generate a charge current flowing in the @xmath13 direction  @xcite , which is in good agreement with the experimental observation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect of impurity scattering and sample size dependence in the iee are not addressed in the simplified theory  @xcite . in this letter , we follow the model of luo @xmath10 @xmath11  @xcite and employ a semiclassical approach  @xcite to study the iee of the topological surface states . </S>",

    "<S> , width=226 ]    let us start from the effective hamiltonian of surface states of a thin film of 3d ti @xmath2  @xcite @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the electron momentum , @xmath16 with @xmath17 are the pauli matrices for electron spin , and @xmath18 describes the bonding and antibonding of surface states on the two surfaces , with @xmath19 as the hybridization energy . the eigenenergies for @xmath20 are degenerate , given by @xmath21 here , @xmath22 , and signs @xmath23 and @xmath24 are for the conduction and valence bands , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding eigenstates will be denoted as @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy @xmath26 is set to be in the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> we now calculate the average of @xmath27 in the eigenstates @xmath25 by using the feynman - hellman theorem , yieding @xmath28 with @xmath29 , which will be used later . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi velocity , being renormalized by the nonzero hybridization energy , becomes @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] illustrates the setup for observing the iee . </S>",
    "<S> a ferromagnet covers a part of a ti film . when the magnetization is stimulated to precess around a certain direction @xmath31 , a spin bias polarized along @xmath31 is generated in the covered region of the ti film . in other words , for an electron with spin parallel or antiparallel to @xmath31 , its chemical potential increases or decreases by an amount @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin bias can be conveniently described by the operator @xmath33 . in the ballistic regime </S>",
    "<S> , it has been demonstrated that for the geometry shown in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> , only the @xmath12 component of the spin bas contributes to the iee effect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for simplicity , we focus on the favorable situation , where the spin bias is polarized in the @xmath12 direction . the semi - classical boltzmann equation  @xcite is used to describe the electronic transport @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the nonequilibrium distribution function of the electrons in the @xmath36 band , and @xmath37 is the relaxation time due to impurity scattering . in the linear - response regime , the distribution function takes the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the equilibrium distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ boltz0 ] ) that @xmath40 satisfies the following equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> the region covered by the ferromagnet is treated as a reservoir , and the uncovered region is considered as the sample region . since there is a spin bias in the reservoir , so the electron distribution function in the reservoir deviates from the equilibrium distribution function , @xmath43 , where the spin bias is projected into the subspace of the @xmath36 band . for right - moving electrons , </S>",
    "<S> when they just cross the @xmath44 boundary between the reservoir and sample region , their distribution function remains to be same as in the reservoir . as a consequence , @xmath45 the right end of the sample region at @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> is assumed to connect to another equilibrium reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> when left - moving electrons cross the boundary @xmath46 , their distribution function remains to be in the equilibrium state , such that @xmath47    integrating the first - order linear differential equation ( [ boltz1 ] ) and taking the boundary conditions eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ boundary1 ] ) and ( [ boundary2 ] ) into consideration , it is easy to obtain a self - consistent equation for @xmath48 , which can be solved numerically  @xcite . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is found that a linear approximation @xmath49 to @xmath48 generally works very well . in particular , the linear approximation becomes exact in the ballistic limit , i.e. , @xmath50 , and diffusive limit , @xmath51  @xcite . by following a similar procedure as that detailed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we obtain for the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the electron mean free path , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 @xmath59 in the appendix , we will show that this linear approximation to @xmath60 is very accurate in comparison with the exact solution .    </S>",
    "<S> the electrical current is given by @xmath61 following shen , vignale , and raimondi  @xcite , we define an iee conductance @xmath62 . by using the above linear approximation to @xmath60 , analytical expression for @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> can be obtained as @xmath64 where @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 as the number of conducting channels , and @xmath68 we have divided @xmath63 into two parts , labeled by superscripts `` bal '' and `` dif '' , corresponding to contributions from electron ballistic and diffusive transport processes . in the ballistic limit , </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath69 , it is easy to obtain @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with that obtained by luo @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11  @xcite using the landauer - bttiker formula in the ballistic regime in the absence of the contact potential barrier . in the opposite diffusive limit , where @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 , which is essentially a drude like formula .    </S>",
    "<S> when the electric current @xmath73 flows through the system , it causes a voltage difference @xmath74 between the two ends of the system , where @xmath75 is the electrical conductance of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the ratio @xmath3 to measure the efficiency of the spin - charge conversion . in general , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath76 , and @xmath77 would mean perfect spin - charge conversion , in which a spin bias @xmath0 is fully converted to an equal amount of charge bias . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath78 by definition , the efficiency ratio can also be expressed as @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for @xmath75 is given by  @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ giee ] ) and ( [ g ] ) , one can calculate the efficiency ratio . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to find that the efficiency ratio @xmath82 normalized by @xmath83 is a universal function of @xmath84 , independent of any model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated curve of the universal function is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that in the ballistic and diffusive limits , @xmath85 converges to two different constants . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , using the expressions for @xmath75 in the two limits  @xcite , @xmath86 for @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for @xmath89 , one can readily obtain @xmath90 in the ballistic limit , and @xmath91 in the diffusive limit . </S>",
    "<S> we mention that these asymptotic formulas for @xmath85 are exact , because the linear approximation to @xmath60 becomes exact in the ballistic and diffusive limits  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result that @xmath82 approaches @xmath92 in the diffusive limit can be understood as follows . in the diffusive limit , @xmath89 , </S>",
    "<S> the electrons propagating at small angles with the @xmath13 axis , i.e. , @xmath93 , make dominant contributions to the electric current . for @xmath93 , the boundary condition eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ boundary1 ] ) reduces to @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the spin bias @xmath0 is just equivalent to a charge bias @xmath95 , and as a result , the efficiency ratio becomes @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> when the electron fermi energy @xmath26 is much larger than the hybridization gap @xmath19 , we have @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 in the ballistic limit and @xmath77 in the diffusive limit . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - charge conversion is perfect in the diffusive limit .     versus @xmath84 , where @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 approaches @xmath4 in the ballistic limit , and @xmath5 in the diffusive limit . , </S>",
    "<S> width=264 ]    we have shown that highly efficient iee or spin - charge conversion can be achieved on a ti surface because of the spin - momentum interlocking of the surface states . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical theory for the iee is developed , which is valid from the ballistic to diffusive regime . </S>",
    "<S> the iee will be very useful for electrical detection of spin current and spin accumulation in spintronics .    </S>",
