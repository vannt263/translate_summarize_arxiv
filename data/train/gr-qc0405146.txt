    "fast rotation is also very important in newly - born neutron stars , which may undergo secular and dynamical instabilities ( andersson & kokkotas 2001 , kokkotas & ruoff 2002 ) .",
    "an accurate modelling of the spacetime of rotating stars is therefore important both in astrophysical studies and in investigations of sources of gravitational waves .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare two relativistic approximate models , the slow rotation expansion of hartle & thorne ( 1968 , henceforth ht ) and the exact vacuum solution by manko _",
    "( manko 2000a , 2000b ) , with a full general - relativistic numerical one , quantifying the range of validity of the ht expansion and studying the possible overlap of the two approximations .",
    "the schwarzschild metric describes either a non - rotating black hole ( bh ) or the exterior of a non - rotating star : this is a well - known consequence of birkhoff s theorem .",
    "in contrast , the rotating kerr bh metric describes a rotating star only to linear order in rotational velocity . at higher orders ,",
    "the multipole moments of the gravitational field created by a rapidly rotating compact star differ from those of a bh .",
    "this difference in the multipolar structure has important consequences for the observation of the electromagnetic and gravitational radiation from these objects .",
    "for example , the detection of gravitational waves emitted by particles in orbit around bhs and compact stars can be used , in principle , to map the multipolar structure of the corresponding spacetime and check the validity of the bh no - hair theorem ( ryan 1995 , 1997 ; collins & hughes 2004 ) .",
    "a relatively simple description of the spacetime of rotating stars was developed many years ago by hartle and collaborators ( hartle 1967 , hartle & thorne 1968 ; see also chandrasekhar & miller 1974 ) using a slow rotation expansion , that is , an expansion in the parameter @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the star s angular velocity and @xmath9 is a rotational scale set by the keplerian frequency of a test particle sitting on the equator of a non - rotating star with gravitational mass @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 ( throughout this paper we use geometrical units , @xmath12 ) . in the newtonian limit ,",
    "uniformly rotating polytropic stars shed matter at the equator at a mass - shedding frequency which is roughly given by @xmath13 .",
    "this is not true in a general relativistic framework ( see eg .",
    "stergioulas 2003 ) .",
    "however @xmath14 does give an order of magnitude estimate of the mass shedding frequency , so we can roughly expect the ht treatment to break down when @xmath15 .",
    "the ht method allows a systematic computation of the interior and exterior structure at successive orders in @xmath16 . at order @xmath16 ,",
    "deviations from non - rotating stellar models are due to the relativistic frame dragging , but the stellar structure is still spherical .",
    "deviations from sphericity are measured by the star s quadrupole moment ; they appear at order @xmath17 .",
    "being a slow - rotation expansion , the ht metric is expected to lose accuracy for rapid spin rates , but the limits of validity of the approximation are not well understood .",
    "weber & glendenning ( 1992 ) compared the slow - rotation expansion with early numerical results by friedman _",
    "their comparison led to ` compatible results ' down to rotational kepler periods @xmath18 ms .",
    "however their self - consistency equation [ eq .  ( 7 ) in weber & glendenning ( 1992 ) ] to determine the mass - shedding frequency is not consistently truncated at second order in angular velocity , as it should be .",
    "this is presumably one of the reasons their method becomes very inaccurate close to the limiting - mass model .",
    "numerical solutions for uniformly rotating stars can now be obtained in both the slow and fast - rotation regimes .",
    "the ht approximation is quite simple to implement : our own numerical code will be described in section [ integ ] . in contrast , a solution of the einstein equations for rapidly rotating models is non - trivial .",
    "komatsu , eriguchi and hachisu ( 1989 ) devised a self - consistent method to solve the full einstein equations , which was later improved by cook , shapiro and teukolsky ( 1994 , henceforth cst ) .",
    "stergioulas rns code ( stergioulas & friedman 1995 ) is a variant of the cst code which has been extended to allow for strange - star matter equations of state ( eoss ) , differential rotation , computation of multipole moments and so on .",
    "a very accurate spectral method for computing rapidly rotating stellar models was independently developed by bonazzola _",
    "_ 1993 , salgado _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) and became part of the numerical relativity library lorene ( bonazzola _ et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that the different numerical methods are in remarkable agreement , typical differences being of order @xmath19 or smaller for smooth eoss .",
    "a new multi - domain spectral method has been introduced by ansorg _",
    "( 2002 ) , who achieved near - machine accuracy for uniform density stars ; their results are in very good agreement with those of the other groups .",
    "the rns code therefore provides a numerically accurate description of fast - rotating relativistic stars .",
    "berti & stergioulas ( 2003 , henceforth bs ) used the rns code to compute constant rest - mass ( so - called evolutionary ) sequences of three types using five realistic eoss .",
    "the first type mimics the evolutionary track of a canonical neutron star having gravitational mass @xmath20 in the non - rotating limit .",
    "the second type has the maximum gravitational mass @xmath21 allowed by the given eos in the non - rotating limit . in the following",
    ", we will sometimes refer to these sequences as type ` 14 ' and type ` mm ' .",
    "the third type is supramassive : its baryon mass is larger than allowed by the non - rotating tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations .",
    "a supramassive sequence does not terminate with a non - rotating model , so that a comparison with ht models is not always possible .",
    "therefore we do not consider supramassive models in the following .",
    "another method of approximating the exterior spacetime takes the form of a multipole expansion far from the star .",
    "this technique has been used by shibata & sasaki ( 1998 ) to derive approximate analytic expressions for the location of the innermost stable circular orbits ( iscos ) around rapidly rotating relativistic stars .",
    "however the technique can not easily be applied to other problems .",
    "furthermore , the relevant multipole moments must be computed _ numerically _ for each model one wants to analyze , and then plugged into the relevant formulas .",
    "approximate analytic models for fast rotating stars which include only the most relevant multipolar structure of the exterior spacetime ( that is , the lowest - order mass and current multipoles ) would be very useful for astrophysical applications . in this paper",
    "we focus on an interesting family of solutions found by manko _",
    "( 2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "they used sibgatullin s method ( sibgatullin 1991 ) , which has the advantage that the multipolar structure of the spacetime can be prescribed _ a priori _ , to find an exact , nine - parameter , analytic solution of the einstein - maxwell equations . consideration of the full einstein - maxwell system is motivated by the fact that compact stars normally have extremely large magnetic fields , which could significantly change their properties ( bocquet _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) and the development of instabilities ( spruit _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; rezzolla _ et al .",
    "however , for simplicity , we do not consider effects due to magnetic fields in this paper .    an approximate description of a rapidly rotating neutron star can be obtained using a five parameter sub - case of the analytic solution ( manko 2000b ) .",
    "ignoring charge and magnetic moment the free parameters reduce to three .",
    "this three - parameter solution is an _",
    "exact _ solution of the einstein equations in vacuum , but it only provides an approximate description of a neutron star exterior , angular momentum @xmath22 , mass quadrupole moment @xmath0 and current octupole moment @xmath23",
    ". however their statement that these are the only nonvanishing moments is not precise : there do exist higher - order nonvanishing physical moments of the manko metric . ] .",
    "bs showed that the manko solution approximates rather well the field of a rapidly rotating neutron star in the fast rotation regime .",
    "they used the three parameters of the analytic solution to match the dominant multipole moments ( @xmath10 , @xmath22 and @xmath24 ) to given numerical models .",
    "they found that an indicative measure of the deviation of the manko metric from the numerical metric is given by the relative error in the first non - freely adjustable multipole moment : the current octupole @xmath23 .",
    "bs found a peculiar feature of the manko solution : the solution s quadrupole moment _ can not _ be matched to the quadrupole moment of numerically computed spacetimes for slow rotation rates .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to understand whether the regimes where the ht and the manko metrics are applicable are completely distinct , or have some range of @xmath8 in common .",
    "this paper compares the ht slow rotation expansion and the exact vacuum solution by manko _",
    "et al . _ with the full general - relativistic numerical cst spacetime .",
    "we will assume that our numerical models , obtained using the rns code , are _ exact _ ( within their numerical accuracy , that is of the order of @xmath25 in each computed quantity ) .",
    "an overview of the three different spacetimes we consider in this paper is presented in section [ intrometrics ] , where we also introduce our notation .",
    "the rest of the paper consists of two parts . in the first we integrate the ht equations of structure for the same set of ` realistic ' , nuclear physics motivated",
    "eoss examined in bs ( section [ integ ] ) . from the stable models in the ht sequence we choose those which have the same gravitational mass and angular momentum as a given numerical model .",
    "the procedure to do this is developed in section [ match ] .    in section",
    "[ accurate ] we quantify deviations of the ht and cst spacetimes . a trustworthy measure of the deviation is given by the relative error in the first non - freely adjustable multipole moment in the ht spacetime : @xmath24 .",
    "picking a representative eos we show that deviations in @xmath0 are at most @xmath26 at the rotation rates corresponding to the fastest observed millisecond pulsar psr j1939 + 2134 ( backer _ et al .",
    "_ 1982 ) , for both mass sequences .",
    "we also use some recent results by abramowicz _",
    "( 2003 ) to compute the isco radii predicted by the ht approximation for sequences of slowly - rotating models .",
    "we find an interesting result : the ht approximation gives _ an excellent approximation to the isco predicted by numerical solutions _ , relative errors being smaller than 1  % for astrophysically relevant rotation rates , down to the @xmath27  ms period of psr j1939 + 2134 .    in the second part of the paper",
    "we compare the three vacuum exterior spacetimes , focusing on invariant quantities , and looking at their petrov classification . in a nutshell ,",
    "the petrov classification of a spacetime depends on which of the weyl scalars can be set to zero by suitable tetrad rotations ( chandrasekhar 1983 , stephani _",
    "_ 2003 , stephani 2004 ) .",
    "the kerr metric is of petrov type d , hence algebraically special .",
    "in general , rotating perfect fluid spacetimes will _ not _ be of type d ( see eg .",
    "fodor and perjs 2000 ) , but will be of ( general ) type i. our invariant comparison of the three different models involves quantifying the deviation of each metric from speciality . indeed one might wish to assume ( for example in perturbative calculations of gravitational wave emission ) that rotating neutron star spacetimes are in some sense ` close ' to type d. then one should develop a tool to quantify their ` non - type - d - ness ' : here we use the curvature invariant speciality index @xmath4 introduced by baker & campanelli ( 2000 ) .",
    "each metric is expressed in different coordinates , so we evaluate @xmath4 at the stellar radius , a physically identifiable radial location . this quantity may also indicate whether it is sensible to carry out perturbative calculations on neutron star backgrounds in a ` type - d - approximation ' , and to extract the gravitational wave content of the spacetime through a teukolsky - like formalism . in this paper",
    ", however , we will focus only on calculations of the weyl scalars in the background spacetimes .",
    "we choose the simplest and most physically transparent tetrad to compute the weyl scalars and to characterise the non - type - d - ness of the spacetime .",
    "first of all we construct a transverse tetrad , in which @xmath28 , so getting rid of this tetrad gauge freedom ( szekeres 1965 ) . then we carry out a tetrad rotation to go to the canonical frame in which @xmath29 ( pollney _ et al . _ 2000 ; re _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) , that we call symmetric . in a type",
    "i spacetime , there are three distinct equivalence classes of transverse frames ( beetle & burko 2002 ) , each containing a symmetric tetrad . from these three different symmetric tetrads",
    "we select a ` quasi - kinnersley ' tetrad ( cf .",
    "2004 ) , i.e. the one that directly reduces to the canonical frame for type d when we set the parameters to reduce the metric to this type .",
    "we apply this procedure , which is described in detail in section [ tetrad ] , to all three metrics . in section [ weyl ]",
    "we show the scalars and the corresponding speciality index .",
    "we find that deviations from speciality on the equatorial plane are smaller than @xmath30 at the stellar radius , even for the faster rotating models .",
    "these deviations rapidly decrease for slower rotation rates and at larger distances from the star .",
    "we find that , at leading order , the deviation from type d is proportional to @xmath6 . the conclusions and a discussion follow .",

    "finally , the model with the chosen value of @xmath69 is calculated , having rotating gravitational mass @xmath70 , angular momentum @xmath71 , and quadrupole moment @xmath72 .",
    "the effects of rotation on the various quantities of interest appear at different orders in @xmath16 .",
    "the general relativistic frame dragging appears at first order , and the angular momentum is : @xmath73    the radius of gyration @xmath74 , defined so that the moment of inertia is @xmath75 , can then be calculated as @xmath76 where the first two relations are exact , and the third expresses the fact that computing @xmath74 requires the integration of the equations of structure at first order in @xmath16 . however , involving the ratio of @xmath22 and @xmath8 ( which are both proportional to @xmath16 ) @xmath74 does not depend on @xmath16 . for the same reason , computing the second order contribution to @xmath74 would require third order corrections to @xmath22 and @xmath8 .",
    "at second order in @xmath16 there appear corrections to the stellar eccentricity @xmath77 , quadrupole moment @xmath0 , mass @xmath10 , binding energy @xmath61 , and coordinate stellar radius @xmath11 .",

    "the equatorial radius @xmath84 , and the polar radius @xmath85 . ] .",
    "the quadrupole moment @xmath0 can be invariantly defined as the leading coefficient in the asymptotic behavior at large distances from the origin of the eccentricity of a family of spheroidal surfaces where the norm of the timelike killing vector is constant .",

    "we found agreement on all significant digits for the quantities we have just defined .",
    "then we chose the same set of ` realistic ' eoss used in bs , and verified that in the non - rotating limit our numerical results are consistent with stergioulas rns code ( described in stergioulas & friedman 1995 ) .",
    "for any given ` realistic ' eos , we can construct a sequence of rotating models by integrating the ht structure equations for a series of values of the central energy density .",

    "let us stress again that although @xmath65 is not the mass - shedding limit in a general relativistic framework , because of its physical meaning it does give an order of magnitude estimate of the mass shedding frequency , and so we can expect the ht treatment to break down when @xmath15 .      to find a ht model that corresponds to a particular cst stellar model ,",
    "say one belonging to the constant - rest mass sequences computed in bs using the rns code , we adopt the following procedure , in which quantities obtained from the cst model are labeled with overbars : @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    the aim is to find a ht model for which @xmath100 and @xmath101 . imposing these values on eqs .",

    "this turns out to be indeed the case .    in table",
    "[ matching ] we show some basic features of the matching models for the five eoss we consider .",
    "the ht models we compute are matched to the slowest - rotating models of the evolutionary sequences presented in tables 1 - 5 of bs : as just mentioned , eq .",
    "( [ fzero ] ) has no solutions beyond some critical rotation rate .    for each eos we present matching models for the 14 sequence above matching models for the mm sequence .",

    "in the previous section we have seen how , given a numerical solution of the full einstein equations with gravitational mass @xmath112 and ( small enough ) angular momentum @xmath113 , we can construct a ht model matching the given values of @xmath10 and @xmath22 .",
    "our purpose in this section is to give two alternative , quantitative estimates of the difference between each of the ht matching models and the corresponding numerical model .",
    "the first estimate will be based on the calculation of the spacetimes quadrupole moment as a function of the rotation rate ; the second , on the calculation of the isco radii .",
    "the matching models described in section [ match ] are constructed by imposing that the first mass multipole @xmath10 and the first current multipole @xmath22 be the same as in the numerical spacetime .",
    "the ht solution is a two - parameter family : once @xmath59 and @xmath16 are specified , the whole multipolar structure of the ht spacetime is . in particular , at second order in @xmath16 the ht structure equations predict a specific value for the quadrupole moment @xmath114 .",
    "since multipole moments are global features of a spacetime ( fodor , hoenselaers & perjs 1989 ) , we can measure the ` distance ' of the ht spacetime from the numerical spacetime by looking at the difference between the value @xmath114 predicted by the ht code , and the ` exact ' value @xmath0 predicted by the rns code .",
    "that is , we compute the relative deviation @xmath115 given that the ht metric is exact in the limit @xmath116 , but becomes less accurate for larger values of @xmath16 , we expect this deviation to increase with the rotation rate : an explicit calculation shows that this is indeed the case .",

    "[ matching ] one can see that deviations are not very sensitive to the eos : for example , when @xmath119 the relative error for the mm sequence ranges ( roughly ) between 25 % and 30 % . at fixed @xmath16 , @xmath120 is larger for the mm sequence than for the 14 sequence .",

    "since @xmath0 is larger for the 14 sequence , and percentage errors induced by the ht approximation are comparable to those for the mm sequence , the ht approximation should induce larger errors in the isco for the low - mass 14 sequence .",
    "this will be explicitly shown in section [ isco ] .",
    "table 6 contains only a few slow - rotating models for each eos . to get a better idea of",
    "what happens in the slow - rotation regime we have selected eos fps ( which is quite average in terms of stiffness ) and computed more numerical models for small values of @xmath22 ( that is , for small values of @xmath16 ) .",
    "namely , we used the rns code to compute 11 constant rest - mass models for the 14 sequence and 10 models for the mm sequence , spanning the range @xmath105 to @xmath121 .",
    "to each of these models we matched a ht model .",
    "results for the relative deviations in the quadrupole moment are shown in fig.[deltaq ] .",
    "the convergence to zero as @xmath116 is very smooth for the fps 14 sequence . for the fps mm sequence",
    ", the slowest rotating model seems to show a slight deviation from the general trend .",
    "we suspect this is due to a loss of accuracy of the rns code in computing the comparatively smaller @xmath0 ( for any given @xmath16 ) of the more compact mm star models with small rotation rates . indeed ,",
    "when we compute the curvature invariants for these models we also find some numerical noise : this can be seen by a close scrutiny of the bottom curve in the lower panels of figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "the relative error @xmath120 is of the same order of magnitude in both cases , but it is systematically larger for the fps mm sequence than for the fps 14 sequence .",
    "the exterior vacuum metric for a ht model truncated at second order in @xmath16 depends only on @xmath10 , @xmath22 and @xmath122 .",
    "in particular , once we have computed these multipole moments we can use them to compute the coordinate isco radius using the results by abramowicz _",
    "( 2003 ) . using the dimensionless quantities @xmath44 and @xmath45 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ jq ] ) , their prediction for the _ coordinate _ isco radii is [ aakteq ] r_&=&6 m , where @xmath123 refers to corotating orbits , and @xmath124 to counterrotating orbits .",
    "the comparison of the ht isco radii as given by eq .",
    "( [ aakteq ] ) to numerical results from the rns code provides an alternative measure of the difference between a numerical model and the corresponding ht matching model .",
    "we consider again the slow - rotating evolutionary sequence for eos fps described in section [ quad ] . for each model along this evolutionary sequence",
    "we compute @xmath10 , @xmath22 and @xmath114 , and we plug those values in eq .",
    "( [ aakteq ] ) to compute the _ coordinate _ isco radii .",
    "then we can easily compute the _ circumferential _ isco radii for these equatorial orbits as r^(ht)_= , and compare our results with the numerical value of the circumferential isco radii in the notation of cst and bs . ] as obtained from rns .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show results for the fps 14 sequence ( top panel ) and for the fps mm sequence ( bottom panel ) . in each panel",
    "we plot together , as functions of @xmath16 : 1 ) the circumferential radii @xmath11 of the stars , 2 ) the corotating iscos @xmath125 , 3 ) the counterrotating iscos @xmath126 .",
    "filled symbols are obtained from rns , and empty symbols correspond to the ht matching models .",
    "the circumferential radius for each matching model is just @xmath127 where @xmath79 is the _ coordinate _ equatorial radius , obtained by integrating the ht equations of structure .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that for neutron stars of canonical mass @xmath128 the deviation of ht from the full numerical solution is larger .",
    "however , even in that case the ht approximation gives very accurate predictions both for the stellar equatorial radii and for the isco radii up to @xmath129 .",
    "in particular , the fastest rotating model in the fps 14 sequence for which a corotating isco exists has @xmath130 and a spin frequency in physical units @xmath131",
    "s@xmath132 , corresponding to an orbital period @xmath133  ms .",
    "therefore our calculation shows that the ht approximation accurately predicts isco radii down to periods which are comparable to that of the fastest observed millisecond pulsar , psr j1939 + 2134 , spinning at @xmath134  ms ( backer _ et al .",
    "_ 1982 ) .",
    "relative errors for corotating and counterrotating iscos are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for both the fps 14 and fps mm sequences . in this plot",
    "we use the same convention as in bs : @xmath135 corresponds to counterrotating orbits .",
    "as one would expect , errors tend to zero as @xmath116 .",
    "the error for counterrotating iscos monotonically increases for large @xmath16 ; the error for corotating iscos does not ( at least for the fps mm sequence ) and it is typically extremely small ( below 5 parts in a thousand , roughly the same accuracy as our numerical runs of the rns code ) .",
    "we suspect that this could be due to the second order ht approximation being sufficiently accurate to compute the corotating isco , but not the counterrotating ones . to confirm our conjecture we would need to push the ht calculation to third order , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "as anticipated in section [ quad ] , isco radii for the mm sequence agree better with the numerical results .",
    "stars in the lower - mass fps 14 evolutionary sequence have larger @xmath0 ( they are more oblate ) , and relative errors in @xmath0 for both sequences are roughly comparable . therefore effects due to the quadrupole moment on the location of the isco are larger for the lower - mass sequence .",
    "notice also that , although deviations in the quadrupole moment can be as large as 20 % for stars rotating with @xmath136 , the relative errors on the isco are typically smaller than 1 % at the same rotation rates . this can be understood by looking at eq.([aakteq ] ) .",
    "for small rotation rates we have seen in section [ integ ] that @xmath137 , where @xmath54 is a constant of order unity .",
    "this scaling property is actually more general , applying also to numerical solutions with large rotation rates : laarakkers & poisson ( 1999 ) showed that @xmath54 depends on the eos and on the mass of the stellar model , ranging between @xmath138 for high - mass models with soft eoss and @xmath139 for low - mass models with stiff eoss ( cf . their table 7 ; see also miller 1977 for similar results in the ht approximation ) .",
    "the numerical coefficient of the @xmath140-dependent correction in eq .",
    "( [ aakteq ] ) is @xmath141 , while the numerical coefficient of the @xmath45-dependent correction is @xmath142 : that is , the two coefficients are roughly equal in magnitude but opposite in sign .",
    "for this reason , shape - dependent effects in the isco ( which are @xmath143 ) tend to cancel for small rotation rates .",
    "this explains why the ht approximation does such a good job in predicting the isco radii .",
    "to better illustrate the physical significance of our results , in fig .",
    "[ periods ] we plot the relative errors in the quadrupole moments ( top panel ) and in the isco radii ( bottom panel ) as a function of the spin period @xmath144 ( in milliseconds ) of our rotating stellar models .",
    "this plot is useful for the following reasons .",
    "first of all , the relation between the ht expansion parameter @xmath16 and the rotational period of pulsars is non - linear . not only is @xmath144 proportional to @xmath145",
    ", it also has ( for the constant - rest mass sequences we consider ) a weak but non - trivial dependence on the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 : p== = .",
    "[ periods ] shows that all of our so - called ` slow rotation ' models are actually millisecond pulsars , many of which rotate even faster than the fastest observed millisecond pulsar psr j1939 + 2134 ( backer _ et al .",
    "this gives a concrete idea of the rotation rates we are considering in this paper .    in both panels we mark by a vertical line the spin frequency of psr j1939 + 2134 .",
    "the relative error in @xmath0 for a pulsar spinning as fast as psr j1939 + 2134 is of order 20 % , and this is quite independent of the stellar mass . remarkably , the relative error in corotating and counterrotating iscos induced by the ht approximation is smaller than 1 % , even when the pulsar rotates with a period as small as @xmath27 ms .",
    "this upper limit on deviations in the isco applies both to the fps 14 sequence and to the fps mm sequence .    for concreteness , in fig .",
    "[ periods ] we presented the specific example of psr j1939 + 2134 .",
    "however we wish to stress that our analysis can be considered more general . even if faster pulsars were discovered , our conclusions are likely to be only marginally altered .",
    "indeed , chakrabarti _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) performed a statistical analysis of observations of 11 nuclear powered pulsars with spin frequencies between 270 hz and 619 hz .",
    "their analysis implies an upper limit of 760 hz ( @xmath146 confidence level ) on the spin frequency , to be compared with the 641 hz of psr j1939 + 2134 .",
    "therefore psr j1939 + 2134 should be very close to the _ maximum _ spin frequency allowed for an isolated neutron star .",
    "interestingly , the upper limit from burst oscillations is much lower than the mass - shedding limit predicted by most eoss : some mechanism must be at work to halt pulsar spin - up while accretion is still active .",
    "a plausible explanation is gravitational wave emission , due either to the excitation of the @xmath147-mode instability or to the presence of an accretion - induced crustal quadrupole moment ( see chakrabarti _",
    "_ 2003 for a discussion ) .",
    "in the remainder of this paper we concentrate on the vacuum surrounding our rotating stellar models .",
    "we compute the weyl scalars for the ht , manko and cst spacetimes and define the ` quasi - kinnersley ' frame ( section [ qk ] ) . in section [ htqk ]",
    "we present the simple analytical results we obtained for the ht metric , and in section [ mcstws ] we describe the analogous calculation for the manko and cst metrics . in section [ weyl ]",
    "we give numerical results for all three spacetimes .",
    "we introduce a newman - penrose null tetrad \\{@xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 } , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are real and @xmath150 and @xmath151 are complex conjugate , satisfying the usual orthonormality conditions : @xmath152 , @xmath153 , all other products zero .",
    "the weyl scalars are the usual contractions of the weyl tensor , @xmath154 the speciality index ( baker & campanelli 2000 ) is defined as @xmath155 where the curvature invariants @xmath156 and @xmath22 can be expressed as @xmath157 we use the additional conventions that an np tetrad with @xmath158 is called transverse ( beetle & burko 2002 ) , and that if further @xmath159 then it is called symmetric , in which case we may refer to @xmath159 as @xmath160 .",
    "the interpretation of the weyl scalars in the context of bh perturbation theory is that @xmath161 represents radiation along the @xmath148 direction , @xmath162 represents radiation along the @xmath149 direction , while @xmath163 describes the coulomb effect due to the presence of a central mass and the frame dragging of the background kerr spacetime . @xmath164 and @xmath165 are longitudinal effects of no physical interest that can be set to zero by the remaining tetrad freedom ( teukolsky 1973 , stewart & walker 1974 ) . in our case , however , and in general for a stationary spacetime of petrov type i , @xmath161 and @xmath162 represent transverse curvature deviations ( cf .",
