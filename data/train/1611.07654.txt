    "the considerable potential of inas / gaas quantum dots ( qds ) , both for triggered single - photon generation and as quantum logic elements , has spurred the development of a number of platforms that seek to incorporate these qds within photonic circuits .",
    "a direct method is to develop both active and passive components within the same material system . along these lines ,",
    "monolithic gaas - based quantum photonic circuits with on - chip quantum dot - based single - photon sources have been demonstrated by a number of research groups  @xcite .",
    "two general approaches have been adopted . in the first",
    ", passive circuits are composed of low - index - contrast gaas / algaas ridge waveguides produced on top of a gaas / algaas substrate  @xcite .",
    "such waveguide geometries can be produced with relatively straightforward fabrication processes , relying solely on epitaxial growth for vertical optical confinement and a single etching step for lateral confinement . due to the small vertical refractive index contrast that is achievable through growth ,",
    "waveguide cross - section dimensions are typically of the order of microns .",
    "while lower refractive indices are generally desirable for minimizing scattering losses in propagation , large mode field diameters ( and large mode volumes in the case of cavities ) translate into less compact devices , less effective light - matter interactions , and less effective geometrical control of waveguide dispersion ( relevant for on - chip nonlinear optics ) .",
    "in particular , weak vertical confinement means more effective dipolar coupling to substrate radiative modes , translating into a reduced @xmath5-factor for radiating dipoles ( see main text ) .",
    "distributed - feedback reflector - based geometries such as in ref .   can ameliorate this , however the achievable mode - field diameters are also limited by the relatively small index contrast between gaas and algaas .",
    "all of these issues are to great extent circumvented in the second approach , in which circuits composed of suspended gaas waveguides surrounded by air or vacuum , either of the channel  @xcite or photonic crystal  @xcite types ( or both ) , are implemented . in this case , the strong index contrast allows strong transverse field confinement in waveguides of cross - sectional dimensions of the order of hundreds of nanometers .",
    "small modal areas and cavity mode volumes can be achieved , meaning stronger light - matter interactions and higher @xmath5-factors for radiating dipoles  @xcite , together with strong geometry - based control of waveguide dispersion .",
    "an important limitation of such an approach , however , is the losses due to scattering at the etched sidewalls , which can be considerably higher due to the strong index contrast between the semiconductor and the air .",
    "a second issue is that the fragility of suspended gaas structures imposes limits on the dimensions of free - standing circuits , requiring support structures such as tethers or transitions to non - suspended waveguides , which may induce significant scattering losses  @xcite .",
    "fabrication , device handling , and further integration with other types of on - chip elements are also more cumbersome in this case .",
    "an additional challenge common to both approaches is that passive circuits are produced in the same material layer that contains the qds .",
    "because there is no strict separation between active and passive portions of the photonic circuit , the population of qds inside the passive section can contribute to excess optical absorption .    as discussed in the main text ,",
    "our heterogeneous integration platform offers essentially all the advantages of the two approaches described above , while addressing many of the aforementioned challenges .",
    "the large refractive index contrast between gaas and si@xmath87n@xmath178 allows for strong modal confinement within the gaas layer so that large @xmath5 factors can be achieved in the active quantum dot region .",
    "this large refractive index contrast is , in addition , achieved without requiring devices to be undercut , improving the mechanical and thermal stability of the system , particularly as the number of integrated elements increases .",
    "furthermore , complete removal of the gaas material outside in the passive regions avoids excess optical absorption due to the background qd ensemble . within the passive sections",
    ", the large refractive index contrast between si@xmath87n@xmath178 and sio@xmath2 enables the dispersion engineering and large effective nonlinearity needed for nonlinear optics applications , such as frequency downconversion of the qd emission to the 1550  nm telecom band  @xcite .",
    "such nonlinear optics applications can in principle be implemented in suspended gaas photonic circuits , though the much wider bandgap of si@xmath87n@xmath178 and sio@xmath2 in comparison to gaas - based materials ensures that two - photon absorption , an important factor in nonlinear nanophotonic devices , is negligible over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "coupling off - chip to optical fibers can also be optimized , as our platform is compatible with end - fire approaches that utilize inverse tapers and symmetric low - index claddings  @xcite . in particular",
    ", devices can be designed to admit a full sio@xmath2 cladding rather than the current top air cladding , with additional processing likely consisting of a single additional pecvd deposition step .",
    "while all of the fabrication steps that we have demonstrated in this work are scalable , the random nature of the in - plane spatial locations of self - assembled inas / gaas qds is a limitation on the overall yield and ability to , for example , integrate multiple qd sites together within a passive si@xmath87n@xmath178 circuit .",
    "going forward , we note that developments in site - controlled qd growth  @xcite will help to address this issue , and in general will be compatible with our fabrication approach . in the near - term",
    ", we can envision pre - characterization of qds after creating the bonded wafer stack , such that gaas devices are only created in regions for which desirable single qd behavior has been confirmed . in particular , photoluminescence imaging  @xcite has been confirmed as a technique for locating the position of single inas / gaas qds with respect to alignment features , and recent implementations  @xcite have demonstrated the location of single qds within @xmath70  5000  @xmath18m@xmath179 spatial regions with sub-10  nm positioning uncertainty , with typical image acquisition times of 1  s. we anticipate that such an approach can enable a higher throughput than pick - and - place techniques  @xcite , which also require pre - screening of the quantum emitters along with the additional assembly steps .",
    "to produce the starting wafer stack shown in fig .",
    "3a of the main text , we utilized the low - temperature plasma - activated direct wafer bonding procedure of ref .  . the layer stack for the two wafers that are bonded in this procedure , one silicon - based and one gaas - based , are given in tables  [ table : sin ] and  [ table : epi ] respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 layer of the silicon - based stack in table  [ table : sin ] was grown with low - pressure chemical vapor deposition , and the epilayer stack of table  [ table : epi ] was grown via molecular beam epitaxy .",
    ".@xmath0 wafer stack [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : epi ]    a @xmath180  nm layer of sin was deposited on top of cleaved ( @xmath181  mm@xmath179 ) pieces of the iii - v epiwafer with plasma - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) .",
    "contact lithography followed by reactive ion etching in a chf@xmath87/o@xmath2/ar plasma was used to produce @xmath182 wide , @xmath183  cm long , @xmath180  nm deep channels on the @xmath0 wafer surface , prior to bonding .",
    "this was done to prevent the formation of trapped h@xmath2 bubbles at the bonding interface during the annealing process  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 wafer was then cleaved into small ( @xmath184  cm@xmath179 ) pieces .    for wafer bonding ,",
    "the surfaces of the gaas and @xmath0 wafer pieces were cleaned in acetone , then activated in an o@xmath2 plasma for 1 minute , at a pressure of 26.7 pa ( 200  mtorr ) , flow of @xmath186 o@xmath2 mol / s ( 20  sccm ) and 200  w radio - frequency power .",
    "pairs of wafers were then placed in contact and pre - bonded under light manual contact .",
    "the pre - bonded samples were next annealed at 300  @xmath187c for 1 hour in a nitrogen - purged environment to produce a permanent bond .",
    "the warm - up and cool - down rates were set to 5  @xmath187c / min . at this point , samples consisted of small , rectangular - shaped gaas wafer pieces permanently bonded onto the surface of larger @xmath0 wafers .",
    "we next carefully covered the exposed @xmath0 areas on the wafers with apiezon w wax  @xcite that had been previously dissolved in trichloethylene ( tce ) .",
    "the dissolved wax wetted the @xmath0 surfaces and the sidewalls of the bonded gaas pieces , however not the exposed back surfaces of the gaas wafer .",
    "we placed the samples on a hotplate at 80  @xmath187c for 30 minutes to evaporate the tce , solidifying the wax .",
    "the samples were next immersed in a 3:7 h@xmath87po@xmath178:h@xmath2o@xmath2 solution for approximately 5 hours , to remove most of the gaas substrate .",
    "they were then transferred to a 4:1 citric acid ( 50  % mass fraction):h@xmath2o@xmath2 solution , which etched gaas with a very high selectivity with respect to the algaas sacrificial layers .",
    "the samples were left in for approximately 5 hours , until the exposed gaas wafer surface looked uniform and unchanged . at this point ,",
    "the gaas substrate had been completely removed .",
    "next , the samples were dipped in 49  % hf for 30 seconds to remove the algaas sacrifial layers .",
    "finally , the wax was removed with tce .    following the wafer bonding step ,",
    "fabrication proceeded as described in the main text .",
    "further details are provided here .",
    "an array of au alignment marks was first produced on top of the gaas layer via electron - beam lithography followed by metal - lift - off .",
    "a bilayer polymethylmethacrylate / copolymer resist process was used .",
    "an electron - beam evaporator was used to deposit a 10  nm cr adhesion layer , and a 50  nm au layer .",
    "lift - off was carried out in an acetone bath .",
    "electron - beam lithography with zep 520a  @xcite resist followed by inductively - coupled plasma etching using a cl@xmath2:ar chemistry were next used to define gaas devices aligned to the au mark array . because zep520a is a positive - tone resist , devices were defined by etching the gaas only in micron - size areas that surrounded the devices . to remove the remaining gaas from the rest of the wafer surface , we used a wet - etch approach .",
    "first , e - beam lithography with ma - n 2045negative tone resist  @xcite was performed to define protection patterns that covered only the device areas and a selected number of au alignment marks ( a protection patch is highlighted in the optical micrograph fig .",
    "3b in the main text , covering the gaas microring resonator and bus waveguide ) .",
    "the samples were then immersed in tfa gold etchant for @xmath183  min , then in 1020 cr etch solution for @xmath183  min .",
    "this removed exposed cr / au alignment marks , as well as the exposed gaas layer .",
    "the wet etch procedure could be repeated several times without affecting the resist protection layer .",
    "acetone was afterwards used to remove the ma - n resist .",
    "after cleanup of the etched sample surface , a second electron - beam lithography exposure was performed , referenced to the original au mark array , to define @xmath0 waveguide patterns aligned to the previously etched gaas devices .",
    "we emphasize that the alignment marks used were from the original mark array , and were protected during the gaas wet etch step .",
    "reactive ion etching ( rie ) in a chf@xmath87/cf@xmath178 plasma was used to produce the @xmath0 waveguides .",
    "the chip was finally cleaved perpendicular to the @xmath0 waveguides @xmath27  mm away from the gaas devices , to allow access with optical fibers in the endfire configuration .",
