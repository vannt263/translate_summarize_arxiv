    "in a wide energy range , there are some common aspects of heavy ion reaction dynamics .",
    "the energies are large enough and the masses of ions are also large , to consider the heavy ions as classical particles .",
    "their de broglie wavelength is much less than the typical nuclear sizes .",
    "quantum effects influence the underlying microscopic dynamics only , which can be included in the equation of state , in the transport coefficients , or in the kinetic theory describing the reactions . during the collision and assuming straight line trajectories there can be target and projectile spectators in a collision * [ 1 - 3 ] * the rest of the nucleons may hit each other on the way forming a participant zone with both target and projectile nucleons in it .",
    "the most interesting phenomena and the new physics are in the participant zone . the spectator regions also provide us with interesting phenomena .",
    "realistically , the nucleons do not propagate along exactly straight trajectories .",
    "deviations from straight propagations are observed even at the highest energies of 200 gev per nucleon . according to the fluid dynamical model , considerable collective sideward motion",
    "is generated * [ 4]*. we shall deal with the collision problem using statistical physics concepts according to the following vision :    a heavy ion reaction is a dynamical system of a few hundred nucleons .",
    "this is a large number but still far from the continuum , so that deviations from infinite matter limit are important . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of particles participating in a reaction is large enough that the signs of collective matter like behavior can be clearly observed .",
    "this is an interesting territory in statistical physics of small but collective systems .",
    "the methods developed in this field are unique and may also be applicable in other small  statistical systems .",
    "however when quark gluon plasma is formed the number of quanta increases to a large extent * *  [ 5 - 6]**. the plasma can already be considered as a continuum , and finite particle effects should be small .    on the other hand",
    "the heavy ion reaction is a rapid dynamical process .",
    "the question of phase transitions in a dynamical system is still an open field of research .",
    "heavy ion physics may contribute to this field at two points : i ) the dynamics of the phase transitions in `` small '' systems , and ii ) the dynamics of the phase transitions in ultra - relativistic systems where the energy of the system is much higher than the rest mass of the particles .    in this context",
    ", we shall deal with the problem from the statistical thermodynamic point of view .",
    "in other words a hypothetical model will be tailored according to the following concepts :    a.during the heavy ion collisions , the participant nucleons form a thermodynamic system by a cylindrical cut of the projectile through the target nucleus .",
    "b.a fireball oriented trend is used considering valence quarks of the nucleons as the constituent particles of the overlap region .",
    "c.binary collisions are assumed among the existing valence and the created sea quarks .",
    "accordingly a significant increase in energy density of the system leads to an environment eligible to create more particles in a frame of grand canonical ensemble .",
    "d.a simple quark wave function is assumed to be used in calculating the partition function of the system .",
    "e.a power series expansion of the partition function is assumed and we will consider only the first few terms that fit the boundary conditions of the system .    according to the above mentioned assumptions",
    "we calculate the newly created particle multiplicity produced in @xmath0 collisions to be compared with the recently published experimental data . in doing this",
    "we should take into consideration the following points :    i)the leading baryon is hardly stopped ,    ii)in the rapidity region between the projectile and the target , secondary charged particles ( mesons @xmath1 ; @xmath2 ; @xmath3 ; @xmath4 , etc . )",
    "are created through string mechanism * [ 7 - 8]*.    the paper is organized in four sections after this soft introduction . in section 2",
    "we represent the geometry and the formulation of the model .",
    "results and discussion are given in section 3 .",
    "eventually conclusive remarks are given in section 4 .",
    "in the hard sphere model , one effective radius @xmath5 * [ 9 - 10 ] * is chosen for all quark collisions .",
    "elastic and inelastic collisions are considered which are supposed to be dominant at temperatures @xmath6 , [ 11]*.    the boltzmann equation is used to find the distribution function in phase space of the thermodynamic system .",
    "it is a function in space coordinate , momentum and time . in a system of large number of particles and a special form of interaction potential",
    ", it will be difficult to get perfect full solution of the equation .",
    "however many trials were done * *  [ 1 ] * * to get approximate solution to the boltzmann equation in a form of conversing power series .",
    "the first term represents the equilibrium state ( zero order term ) .",
    "the next terms represent the higher order corrections to describe the shift due to the non - equilibrium state .",
    "these terms are time dependent and include a time parameter that measure how far from the equilibrium states the particles are produced .",
    "on putting the time parameter tends to zero , all the higher terms of the series vanishes and the system approach equilibrium and described only by the zero order term .",
    "another trial to find phase space distribution function in a pre - equilibrium state is the following :    due to the none - equilibrium state the temperature is not homogeneous allover the system , but instead there will be a temperature gradient with minimum entropy .",
    "the approach is to divide the system into small stripes ( subsystems ) each has its local equilibrium with a specific temperature and local equilibrium distribution .",
    "the overall phase space distribution will be the sum over the distributions of the subsystems .",
    "this is what we did in our calculation .",
    "the boltzmann statistical approximation allows one to conduct precise numerical calculations of transport coefficients in the hadron gas and to obtain some relatively simple relativistic analytical closed - form expressions .    for particles having spin ,",
    "the differential cross sections were averaged over the initial spin states and summed over the final ones .",
    "the local equilibrium distribution functions are :    @xmath7    where , @xmath8 is the chemical potential of the kth particle species , @xmath9 is the temperature and @xmath10 is the relativistic flow 4-velocity such that @xmath11 with frequently used consequence .",
    "the distribution functions @xmath12 are found by solving the system of the boltzmann equations approximately with the form *  [ 1 ] : *    @xmath13    because analytical expressions for the collision brackets are bulky the mathematica was used for symbolical and some numerical manipulations *  [ 12]*. the numerical calculations are done also for temperatures above @xmath14 .",
    "let us consider the case of the binary collisions between quarks of the thermodynamic system that has been formed during the interaction of heavy ions .",
    "the total hamiltonian is :    @xmath15    @xmath16 is the momentum of the ith quark and @xmath17 is the binary interaction potential energy among quarks@xmath18    the static quark potential at fixed spatial separation has been obtained from an extrapolation of ratios of wilson loops to infinite time separation . as we have to work on still rather coarse lattices and need to know the static quark potential at rather short distances ( in lattice units ) we have to deal with violations of rotational symmetry in the potential . in our analysis of the potential",
    "we take care of this by adopting a strategy used successfully in the analysis of static quark potentials * [ 13 ] * and heavy quark free energies * [ 14 ] . *    this procedure removes most of the short distance lattice artifacts .",
    "it allows us to perform fits to the heavy quark potential with the 3-parameter approach ,    the quark - quark potential is given as    @xmath19    the quark potential is graphically represented in * fig .",
    "( 1)*. it is formed by 3 terms .",
    "the first is a coulomb like ; the second is string repulsive potential that works in confinement the quarks inside the nucleon bag .    in this model ,",
    "the number of created particles depends on the available energy .",
    "accordingly , we focus our calculation on getting information about the relation between the energy and the number of interacting particles and consequently the number of created particles    the grand canonical ensemble considers large supersystem kept at constant @xmath9 and @xmath20 and consists of many subsystems that can exchange not only the energy but also the number of particles .",
    "a number of particles and their quantum numbers corresponding to their energy states specify a microstate in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the particle abundance during the heavy ion collision is much complicated and depends mainly on an environment in the presence of catalyst necessary for the particle creation .",
    "the available energy is necessary to create excess of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "not all the quarks have the chance to form particles .",
    "only those quarks experiencing special conditions in presence of the colored field will form a particle that satisfies the selection rules . moreover , the strength of the color field depends on the separation distance @xmath21 .",
    "the number of parton pairs is @xmath22 and may be approximated as @xmath23 for largevalues of @xmath24__. _ _",
    "@xmath24 depends mainly on the available energy required for creation of quqrk - quqrk pairs .",
    "we follow the thermodynamic regime that starts by calculating the partition function and the translational partition function is then ,    @xmath25    for the sake of indistinguishability we divide * eq .
