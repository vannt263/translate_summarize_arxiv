    "effective field theories is a subject of great interest in theoretical physics not only due to their potential applications but also because they provide new insights into the way we look at field theories @xcite .",
    "from this perspective nonrenormalizable models have acquired a new status as they may become physically relevants at low energies @xcite .",
    "the point is that , if the scale of energy one is interested is low enough , the ambiguities due to the virtual states of high energy do not show up or , equivalently , are not meaningful . on the energy interval where this happens",
    "the theory proceeds as an usual renormalizable one . nonetheless , as observed in @xcite ,",
    "the use of a mass independent regularization is almost mandatory to guarantee that high order counterterms can be effectively neglected .",
    "the ultraviolet behavior of the green functions may be changed by a rearrangement of the perturbative series .",
    "in fact , the incorporation of vacuum polarization effects in general improves the convergence properties of the resumed series ; this mechanism is well known to be operative in the context of the @xmath0 expansion . in particular , gross neveu @xcite or thirring @xcite like four fermion interactions which in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions are perturbatively nonrenormalizable become renormalizable within the framework of the @xmath0 expansion @xcite .",
    "this result has motivated a series of investigations on the properties of these theories @xcite .",
    "in particular , using renormalization group ( rg ) methods , it has been proved that the @xmath1 component gross neveu model in 2 + 1 dimensions is infrared stable at low energies but has also a nontrivial ultraviolet stable fixed point .",
    "these facts indicate that the theory could be perturbatively investigated if the momentum is low enough .",
    "this actually would be the only remaining possibility for small @xmath1 .",
    "it has recently been conjectured that in 2 + 1 dimensions , besides the @xmath0 expansion , there is another way to improve the ultraviolet behavior of feynman amplitudes . by coupling fermion fields to a chern - simons field the scale dimension of field operators",
    "could be lowered possibly turning non renormalizable interactions into renormalizable or , better , super - renormalizable ones . using a sharp cutoff to regulate divergences ,",
    "this idea was tested in @xcite where the effect of the cs field over massless self - coupled fermions with a quartic , gross  neveu like , interaction was studied .    in this communication",
    "we will pursue this study further by considering massive fermions and adopting dimensional renormalization @xcite as a tool to render finite the feynman amplitudes . in this way we evade the ambiguity problem associated with the routing of the momentum flowing through the associated feynman graphs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it should be stressed that our calculations are valid insofar , as said above , the effect of the higher order counterterms can be neglected .",
    "otherwise , new couplings should be introduced .",
    "our investigations , restricted to the case of fermions of just one flavor , i. e. @xmath2 , show that , differently to what happens for large @xmath1,the renormalization group beta function has only a trivial infrared stable fixed point .",
    "moreover , the operator dimensions of the basic field and composites of canonical dimension lower than three are monotonic decreasing functions of the cs parameter .",
    "this indicates that the feynman amplitudes have a better ultraviolet behavior if the underlying theory is renormalizable .",
    "however , no improvement in the ultraviolet behavior seems to occur if the composite operators have canonical dimension bigger than three .",
    "our work is organized as follows .",
    "in section ii some basic properties of the model as feynman rules , ultraviolet behavior of feynman diagrams and comments on the regularization procedure are presented .",
    "the derivation and calculation of the renormalization group parameters are indicated in section iii .",
    "section iv contains a discussion of our results as well as our conclusions .",
    "details of the calculations of the pole part of the relevant amplitudes are described in the appendices [ appendixa ] and [ appendixb ] .",
    "we consider a self - interacting two  component spinor field minimally coupled to a cs field .",
    "the lagrangian density is given by @xmath3    the dirac field @xmath4 represents particles and anti - particles of spin up and the same mass @xmath5 ( the parameter m is to be taken positive ) @xcite . the gross - neveu term in ( [ 1 ] ) is the most general lorentz covariant quartic self - interaction , for the thirring - like vector interaction is not independent but satisfies @xmath6",
    "@xmath7 is a gauge fixing parameter but for simplicity we will always work in the landau gauge , formally obtained by letting @xmath8 . in this gauge",
    ", the green functions may be computed using the feynman rules depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for convenience ,",
    "we have introduced auxiliary dotted lines , hereafter called auxiliary gn lines , to clarify the structure of the four fermion vertex .",
    "divergences show up , the degree of superficial divergence of a generic graph @xmath9 being @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the number of external lines associated with the propagators for the the chern",
    " simons and the fermion fields , respectively ; @xmath13 denotes the number of quartic vertices in @xmath9 .",
    "the model is of course nonrenormalizable and the number of counterterms necessary to render the amplitudes finite increases with the order of perturbation but , to a given order , the number of counterterms is finite . to do calculations",
    "we will employ dimensional renormalization starting at the space - time dimensio @xmath14 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to introduce a dimensionless coupling @xmath15 and a renormalization parameter @xmath16 through @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 must be set zero at the end .",
    "the massive parameter @xmath20 must be considered much bigger than any typical momenta and than the fermion mass @xmath5 ; it sets the scale which limits the region where our results are valid .",
    "divergences will appear as poles in @xmath21 and a renormalized amplitude is given by the @xmath21 independent term in the laurent expansion of the corresponding regularized integral .",
    "however , at one loop level no infinities will remain after the remotion of the regulator .",
    "this is so because the poles for a graph @xmath9 may occur only at even values of the degree of superficial divergence of @xmath9@xcite .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that asymptotically , i. e. , for zero external momenta , one loop graphs with even degree of divergence are odd functions of the loop momentum and therefore vanishes , after symmetric integration .",
    "as known , green functions of renormalizable models , which have been made finite by the subtraction of pole terms in the dimensionally regularized amplitudes , satisfy a t hooft - weinberg type renormalization group equation @xcite .",
    "nonrenormalizable models require special consideration since the form of the effective lagrangian changes with the order of perturbation .",
    "however , at sufficient small momenta , such that the effect of the new counterterms may be neglected , the green functions will still approximately satisfy the rg equation .",
    "thus , although being nonrenormalizable , for small enough momenta , the green function of the theory ( [ 1 ] ) satisfy the following renormalization group equation @xmath22\\gamma^{(n)}(p_1 ,   \\ldots p_n)\\approx 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the vertex function of @xmath1 fermion fields ( since @xmath24 is not a dynamical field we shall not consider vertex functions having external vector fields ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath25 means equality in the region where all counterterms different from those terms already present in ( [ 1 ] ) can be neglected . as a consequence of the coleman  hill theorem , which states that all radiatives corrections to the cs term are finite , @xcite , the @xmath26 function for the cs coupling @xmath27 vanishes identically ; that explains why the term with a derivative with respect to @xmath27 is absent from ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath9 in equation ( [ 2 ] ) may be obtained by formally computing the action of the differential operator over the two point and four point green functions .",
    "for the two point function , up to second order in the coupling constants , we have @xmath30    where the limit @xmath31 must be understood . in the above expression @xmath32 , @xmath33 , denote the regularized feynman amplitudes .",
    "in particular , the graphs ascribed to @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 have been depicted in the figures [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , respectively ; @xmath37 is an operator to remove the pole term in the amplitudes to which it is applied .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the amplitudes @xmath38 and @xmath39 which are associated with one loop diagrams are finite . inserting ( [ 3 ] ) into ( [ 2 ] ) allows us to determine the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath9 as follows .",
    "initially notice that as @xmath20 enters into the perturbative expansion only in the combination @xmath41 , fixing @xmath29 in lowest order as being equal to @xmath15 eliminates all contributions of the term with the derivative with respect to @xmath20 in ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "after that , up to the order we will study , in ( [ 2 ] ) there will be no mixing of higher order contribution to @xmath29 with those to @xmath9 and @xmath28 .",
    "using the expansions , @xmath42 where the sum is restricted to @xmath43 , we get @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , for @xmath47 are defined by writing the pole term for the amplitude @xmath48 as @xmath49    the appendix [ appendixa ] presents a detailed analysis of the various contributions to these parameters . from ( [ i15 ] ) , ( [ i18 ] ) and ( [ i20 ] ) ,",
    "the final result is @xmath50    letting @xmath51 , we note that our determination of @xmath9 agrees with @xcite . in the region @xmath52",
    ", however , our result presents corrections for nonvanishing fermion mass .    to fix",
    "@xmath29 we look now at the four point green function , which up to third order is ( we omit contributions which by power counting are finite ) @xmath53 here , again , the one loop amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 are finite because of the use of the dimensional regularization . inserting ( [ 7 ] ) , the expansion @xmath56 , and @xmath28 and @xmath9 given in ( [ 4a ] ) and ( [ 4b ] ) into ( [ 2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the above expressions , @xmath60 for @xmath47",
    "are related to the pole part of the amplitudes @xmath61 through , @xmath62    in the appendix [ appendixb ] we have collected the results of the calculations of the pole part of the relevant graphs .",
    "using [ b4 ] we obtain , finally , @xmath63",
    "an inspection of eq . ( [ 8a ] ) shows that the renormalization group _ beta _ function has @xmath64 as a fixed point . as , for @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath66 the origin is an infrared stable fixed point . actually , this is the only existing fixed point .",
    "here we are in disagreement with ref .",
    "@xcite where a line of fixed points was found .",
    "the diverse conclusions are perhaps due to the use of different regularizations but a more direct comparison of the methods seems unfeasible as the calculations in @xcite were not spelled out .",
    "we will examine now the dimensions of some operators . as seen",
    "before the basic field @xmath67 has operator dimension @xmath68 , and so at @xmath64 the green functions of the fermion field have an improved ultraviolet behavior as @xmath27 increases .",
    "similar results are obtained if one considers composite operators of canonical dimension less than three .",
    "the simplest of them , the mass operator @xmath69 ha an anomalous dimension given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the residue coming from graphs contributing to the vertex function with the insertion of the mass operator , @xmath72 and having two external fermionic lines . for practical purpose",
    "this residue may be computed by taking the mass derivative of the contributions calculated in the item 1 of appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "the result is @xmath73 .",
    "thus the dimension of @xmath74 turns out to be equal to @xmath75    from the computation of the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath76 one could easily obtain the dimension of @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , the dimension of @xmath77 is given by ( [ 8b ] ) but with the replacement of @xmath71 by @xmath78 .",
    "thus @xmath79 the determination of the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath80 at @xmath64 is more complicated due to the fact that renormalization in general produces a mixing with other operators of dimension lower or equal to four .",
    "however if we restrict the calculation to the @xmath81 case , as we will do , only operators of dimension four need to be considered .",
    "a further simplification is obtained by considering only ( formally ) integrated operators .",
    "we have , @xmath82 & = & a_1\\int d^3 x ( \\bar\\psi \\psi)^2   + a_2   \\int d^3 x \\bar \\psi \\partial^2 \\psi\\\\ \\int d^3x n[\\bar \\psi \\partial^2 \\psi ] & = & b_1\\int d^3 x ( \\bar\\psi \\psi)^2    + b_2 \\int d^3 x \\bar \\psi \\partial^2 \\psi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath1 indicates a normal product prescription corresponding to the subtraction of the pole terms .",
    "a direct calculation gives that @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "a straightforward analysis shows now that the dimensions of @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath87 $ ] are given by @xmath88 respectively .",
    "one sees that , at least for the operators that we explicitly considered , the operator dimension decreases with @xmath27 accordingly the canonical dimension is lower or equal to three , in accord with @xcite .",
    "however , if the canonical dimension is bigger than three , the operator dimension increases with @xmath27 so that no improvement for nonrenormalizable interactions results .        in this appendix",
    "we shall present a detailed analysis of the contributions to the pole part of the two point vertex function .",
    "due to the use of the dimensional regularization the poles only appear at the two loop level , beginning at second order in the coupling constants .",
