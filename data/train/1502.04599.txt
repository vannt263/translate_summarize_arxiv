    "thermoelectric ( te ) conversion in crystalline solids constantly attracts the interest of scientists , not only due to the increasing performance of energy harvesting systems , but also due to the fact that the conventional and well - known thermoelectric materials , such as pb@xmath15 ( @xmath16s , se , te )  @xcite or bi@xmath17te@xmath18 ( e.g.@xcite ) , still surprise by their novel and remarkable physical behaviors .",
    "it is commonly accepted , that te figure of merit @xmath19 well captures basic transport properties of the material at given temperature @xmath14 , i.e. electrical conductivity ( @xmath6 ) , seebeck coefficient ( @xmath7 ) and thermal conductivity ( @xmath20 ) , and is conveniently expressed in dimensionless units .",
    "as all these transport quantities apparently depend on temperature and carrier concentration ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) , the maximum of @xmath21 is expected when properly correlating both intrinsic electron transport properties of the system ( e.g. the band gap magnitude ) with temperature range , and doping level with the hole or electron concentration , to achieve @xmath9 or @xmath10type materials , respectively .",
    "but , getting a better insight into atomic - level connections among crystal stability , electronic and lattice properties of te systems generally allow for a more convinced interpretation of the complex transport phenomena .",
    "recent experimental work  @xcite reported @xmath22 at @xmath23  k , along one of the axis in the single crystal @xmath9 type snse , which classified this well - known semiconductor as a very promising te material .",
    "however , further results  @xcite revealed much lower @xmath21 for polycrystalline samples , showing that snse is a rather complex system .",
    ".crystallographic data  @xcite of the snse compound , measured at different temperatures @xmath24 , used in our calculations for selected temperature ranges @xmath25 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , < , < \" , ]     as we explained in the introduction , due to the transformation of the ht crystal structure to the simple orthorhombic _ pbmm _ space group , brillouin zones in all ( lt , mt and ht ) phases in our calculations have the same shape and high symmetry points ( bz is shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : bands1 ] ) .",
    "the reciprocal space @xmath26 axes are parallel to the @xmath27 real space directions .",
    "let us start with some general comments of the band structure , before going into the detailed analysis of the effective masses and the transport properties . in the lt phase ,",
    "the highest valence band ( vb ) appears in the @xmath28 direction , parallel to the @xmath29 axis .",
    "it is worth noting , that in the lt phase , this highest vb has a pudding moldlike shape , reported to be beneficial for thermoelectric performance in other systems  @xcite . for the higher temperature structures ( mt and ht ) , valence bands are much different , which points out that electronic band structure is sensitive to temperature , as simulated by the unit cell changes .",
    "the pudding moldlike vb changes the shape to become more parabolic , and the second vb at @xmath30-y direction , aligns to band in @xmath30-z direction .",
    "the lowest conduction band ( cb ) , seen in the @xmath31 direction in all phases , is parabollic - like . above the band gap we see ,",
    "that the whole band structure in the @xmath28 direction considerably moves down , as going from lt to ht , which is correlated with the shortening of the corresponding unit cell @xmath32 axis . in the lt structure , the in - plane unit cell parameters , @xmath33     and @xmath34     are significantly different , which in the reciprocal space is reflected in a different alignment of the @xmath31 and @xmath28 bands . after the phase transition , as well as in the mt case , @xmath35 , and the energy locations of cb s",
    "minima and vb s maxima become similar between those two directions .",
    "what seems quite surprising , the differences in the band structures between the lt and mt ( both before the phase transition ) are much larger than between the mt and ht structures ( i.e. induced by the phase transition ) .",
    "this shows that the electronic structure evolves continuously with temperature , however the band gap changes abruptly at the phase transition ( see , tab .",
    "[ table : tabgap ] ) , which can result in rapid changes in the transport properties .",
    "it is also interesting to analyze the bands in @xmath36 and @xmath37 directions , which represent the real - space @xmath38 direction , i.e. contributing the charge transport between the snse layers . in all the cases ,",
    "for the vb part , the resulting bands are very flat , which is quite intuitive , since we expect hampered charge propagation in this direction .",
    "on the other hand , conduction band in @xmath37 is very steep and almost linear .",
