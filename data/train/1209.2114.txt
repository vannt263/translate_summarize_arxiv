    "the orion nebula cluster ( onc , m42 ) is a dense star cluster which is part of a complex star forming region at a distance of about @xmath4 @xcite . due to its relative proximity",
    "the onc is one of the best observationally studied star clusters .",
    "its age is estimated to be @xmath5 , the resolved stellar mass is @xmath6 and it has a compact core of radius @xmath7 @xcite . based on the data presented by @xcite , we estimate a half - mass radius of the cluster of @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the onc is considered to be a prototype of a dense young star cluster and it naturally serves as a test bed for theoretical models of various astrophysical processes ( e.g. @xcite considered the dynamical evolution of onc - type star clusters with gas expulsion ; @xcite studied the destruction of protoplanetary discs due to close stellar encounters ) .",
    "nevertheless , the morphological and dynamical state of the onc is still not fully understood .",
    "some of it s characteristics indicate that it has undergone a period of violent evolution and that the current state does not represent a true picture of a newly born star cluster .",
    "there is a lack of gas in the cluster @xcite which has been expelled due to the radiation pressure of the ob stars that reside in the cluster core .",
    "the effect of gas removal is likely to have led to the cluster expanding by a factor @xmath9 for a star formation efficiency @xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the assumption that the onc has been more compact in the past is in accord with the fact that this star cluster is missing wide binaries with separations @xmath11 which may have been disrupted through close three - body interactions during the initial compact stage @xcite .",
    "the process of dynamical ejections has been suggested by @xcite as a reason for the depletion of the cluster mass function at the high - mass end .",
    "this hypothesis aims to explain the observed deficit of massive stars in the onc @xcite with respect to the standard @xcite initial mass function .",
    "finally , observations @xcite have brought evidence that stellar disruptions occurred in the onc recently .",
    "these may be a consequence of physical stellar collisions in the dense cluster core .    in this paper",
    "we address the history of the onc over its lifetime .",
    "we concentrate on initialy very compact star clusters and show that they can evolve within a few millions years into a state compatible with the current observations .",
    "in particular , we address the fact that the central system of ob stars , the so - called trapezium , is supervirial and , at the same time , that the onc hosts unexpectedly few ob stars .",
    "we restricted ourselves to the stage of cluster evolution when the stars have already formed as individual entities which can be characterised by a constant mass and radius .",
    "stellar dynamics is then driven mainly by gravitational interactions .",
    "we used the numerical code nbody6 @xcite which is a suitable tool for modeling self - gravitating stellar systems with a considerable amount of binaries .    at the initial stage of its evolution ,",
    "a substantial contribution to the gravitational field of the cluster is due to gas .",
    "we incorporated external gas into our model by means of a special type of low mass particles ( @xmath12 ) whose gravitational interaction with the rest of the cluster was treated directly via the n - body scheme . beside that , we modified the original nbody6 code , including an option for a _ repulsive _ force ( with the direction radial from the cluster centre ) acting upon the gas particles in order to mimic the radiation pressure from the stars starting at a given time @xmath13 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : expulsion ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we also modelled the gas expulsion by an instantaneous removal of the gas particles at a given time .",
    "stellar masses were calculated according to the @xcite mass function with an upper mass limit of @xmath14 ( however , the mass of the most massive star is typically @xmath15 ) . for several numerical reasons ( e.g. quadratic growth of cpu time with the number of particles , higher probability of numerical errors for extreme mass ratios ) we replaced low - mass stars ( @xmath16 ) by stars with mass @xmath17 , keeping the total mass unchanged . we have verified ( cf .",
    "models # 4 and # 6 introduced below which have @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively ) that our results are not affected considerably by this approximation .",
    "the stars were considered to have finite radii @xmath20 ( e.g. @xcite ; this simple formula also fits well the radii of zero age main sequence stars for @xmath21 according to @xcite ; our overestimation of stellar radii for @xmath22 does not affect our results , as the low - mass stars contribute only marginally to the merging tree ) .",
    "if the separation of two stars got below the sum of their radii , they were merged into a single star .",
    "we also switched off the option of stellar evolution in the numerical code .",
    "loss of realism is assumed to be negligible as we followed the cluster evolution for a period of only @xmath23 .",
    "the stars in our models are not assigned a spectral type .",
    "for the sake of brevity , we refer to all stars with @xmath24 as ` ob stars ' .     due to gas expulsion .",
    "the total mass of the stars within a @xmath25 radius ( lower panel ) monotonically decreases as stars escape out of the observer s field of view .",
    "this curve reflects gas expulsion with a time delay of @xmath26 which is the time the stars need to reach the @xmath25 boundary .",
    "shaded area represents the @xmath27 variance of the individual realisations of the model . ]      the canonical ( best - fit ) model of the onc has an initial mass of @xmath28 , half of which is in the form of stars , while the other half accounts for gas .",
    "we considered a @xcite initial mass function which , for the given cluster star mass , predicts @xmath29 ob stars to have been formed in the onc @xcite . in order to avoid additional statistical noise in the evolution of the number of ob stars",
    ", we used identical samples of stellar masses for all numerical realisations of the model .",
    "the initial half - mass radius of the cluster is @xmath30 , which is compatible with the initial or birth radius - mass relation inferred for star clusters ranging in mass up to globular clusters @xcite .",
    "positions and velocities are generated in a mass segregated state according to the prescription of @xcite with mass segregation index @xmath31 .",
    "the algorithm by definition places massive stars in the cluster core and , therefore , the initial half - mass radius of the ob stars is @xmath32 . in order",
    "_ not _ to place the light gas particles at the cluster outskirts , we generated initial positions for stellar and gas particles separately , i.e. we had a constant gas to star mass ratio throughout the whole cluster at @xmath33 .",
    "all ob stars were set to be members of primordial binaries with a secondary mass @xmath34 with the pairing algorithm being biased towards assigning a massive secondary to a massive primary .",
    "more specifically , the algorithm first sorts the stars from the most massive to the lighest one .",
    "the most massive star from the set is taken as the primary .",
    "the secondary star index , @xmath35 , in the ordered set is generated as a random number with the probability density @xmath36 and @xmath37 corresponding to a certain mass limit , @xmath38 .",
    "the two stars are removed from the set and the whole procedure is repeated until stars with @xmath39 remain .",
    "typically , we used as the minimal mass of the primary @xmath40 , as the minimal mass of the secondary @xmath41 and the pairing algorithm index @xmath42 . for the assigned binaries we used a semi - major axis distribution according to pik s law @xmath43 @xcite and a thermal distribution of eccentricities , @xmath44 . except for the possibility of being a secondary member of a binary containing an ob star",
    ", we did not generate binaries of low mass stars .",
    "this limitation comes from the requirement of numerical effectivity and it is not likely to affect our results substantially .    let us note that the canonical model presented above fits into the range of the expanding class of models of the onc discussed by @xcite .",
    "other possible initial conditions would be fractal models that collapse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these require star formation to be synchronised across the pre - cluster cloud core to much shorter than the dynamical time though .",
    "most of the features of the evolution of a star cluster with strong few - body relaxation and gas expulsion can be demonstrated with the canonical model . in order to distinguish systematic effects from rather large fluctuations of cluster parameters , we present quantities averaged over @xmath45 realisations of the model .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rh ] shows the temporal evolution of the half - mass radius of the stellar component , @xmath46 . during the initial phase",
    ", the cluster expands due to two - body relaxation .",
    "gas expulsion that starts at @xmath47 removes all gas from the cluster within a few hundred thousand years . from the point of view of the stars",
    ", this event leads to an abrupt decrease of their potential energy .",
    "consequently , they can reach larger distances from the cluster centre , which manifests itself as an accelerated growth of @xmath46 at @xmath48 .",
    "initially weakly bound stars became unbound due to the gas expulsion and they escape from the cluster .",
    "hence , reduction of the cluster mass also accelerates  see the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rh ] where we plot the mass of the star cluster .",
    "we define @xmath49 as the sum of the mass of the stars within a sphere of radius @xmath50 from the cluster centre .",
    "we set @xmath51 in order to match typical observations of the onc , which usually count stars within a projected distance of @xmath52 from the trapezium .",
    "note that the decrease of @xmath49 is accelerated with @xmath53 delay after the time of gas expulsion .",
    "this is due to the unbound stars taking some time to reach @xmath50 . besides the escape of stars due to the gas expulsion , there is also continuous stellar mass loss due to the few - body relaxation which is capable to accelerate stars above the escape velocity . from @xmath54",
    "onwards the cluster expansion is again dominated by relaxational processes driving a revirialisation @xcite .     from the cluster centre ( dashed line ) .",
    "bottom : number of ob stars ( solid line ) and number of ob systems ( dashed line ) within @xmath25 from the cluster centre . ]",
    "our model indicates that the initial mass of the onc must have been at least 20% larger than it is now , after a few million years of dynamical evolution .",
    "we also see that , mainly due to the effect of gas expulsion , the onc must have been more compact by a factor @xmath55 at the time of its birth than it is now . hence , the initial relaxation time was much shorter than what we would infer from present - day observations .",
    "consequently , close few - body interactions must have been more frequent in the past .",
    "in particular , we suggest that scattering of single stars on binaries is a process that has played an important role in the evolution of the onc .",
    "this kind of interaction has been studied intensively in the literature ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a rich variety of outcomes can be obtained , depending on the initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , some general results can be formulated . in particular ,",
    "if the binary is hard , i.e. its orbital velocity is larger than the impact velocity of the third star , it typically shrinks , losing its energy which is transferred to the accelerated single star .",
    "therefore , we expect two processes to happen in correlation : ( i ) ejections of high velocity stars and ( ii ) physical collisions of massive binaries which lead to the formation of more massive objects .",
    "the probability of collisions increases with the mass of the interacting stars .",
    "therefore , numerical models by different authors often show a ` runaway ' process when most of the collisions involve the most massive object which grows continuously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the same is true also for our model of the onc : the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nob ] shows the growth of the mass of the most massive object , @xmath56 , due to stellar collisions ; the number of ob stars left in the cluster is plotted in the lower panel .",
    "approximately one third of the missing ob stars have disappeared due to merging , while the other two thirds have been ejected from the cluster with velocities @xmath57 .",
    "the merging tree varies significanly among individual realisations of the particular model . in general , more than one merging star is formed during the initial @xmath26 . among other processes ,",
    "this is due to the merging of several primordial ob binaries . at later stages ,",
    "usually one runaway - mass object dominates the merging process .    in the appendix we provide an approximate description of the rate of stellar ejections due to the scattering of single stars on massive binaries .",
    "it gives an estimate of the decay time of the number of the ob stars of @xmath58 for the canonical model .",
    "if we assume that the decay rate is linearly proportional to the number of ob stars , we expect roughly an exponential decay of @xmath59 , i.e. it should reach half of its initial value at @xmath60 , which is in good agreement with the numerical results .    .",
    "individual points represent states of different realisations of the canonical model at @xmath61 .",
    "mass of the most massive object in the whole set is plotted in the upper panel , while in the lower one , only objects found within @xmath25 are considered . ]",
    "a mean number of ob stars of @xmath62 remain at @xmath63 .",
    "this considerably exceeds the number of ob systems observed in the onc  the study of @xcite reports only 10 stars heavier than @xmath64 .",
    "however , the real number of massive stars may be somewhat larger due to their ` hiding ' in ob binary systems .",
    "our models always end up with several ob stars having an ob companion and , therefore , a better agreement with the observations is achieved if we count the ob _ systems _ as indicated with the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : nob ] .",
    "moreover , due to the stochastic nature of dynamical cluster evolution , different realisations of the model end up with quite different values of @xmath59 and @xmath56 . the final state ( @xmath63 ) of all realisations of the canonical model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mn ] .",
    "although the distribution of points in the @xmath59@xmath56 space is rather noisy , we can deduce an anti - corelation between these two quantities ( their linear correlation coefficient is @xmath65 ) .",
    "in particular , _ all _ realisations that end up with @xmath66 lead to the formation of a runaway - mass star of mass @xmath67 .",
    "in other words , the underabundance of the high - mass stars in the onc not only indicates a period of prominent two - body relaxation in the past , but also the merging formation of a massive object which may represent an important footprint of the cluster s history .",
    "interestingly , the term ` runaway ' has a secondary meaning in some cases : despite of its high mass , in several realisations the merging object has been ejected out of the cluster with velocity exceeding @xmath68 .",
    "these cases can be identified due to differences of the upper and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : mn ] .",
    "the escape of the most massive body beyond the @xmath25 boundary is also responsible for the drops of the dashed line in the plot of the temporal evolution of @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nob ] which shows the mean mass of the most massive object within @xmath25 from the cluster centre .",
    ".initial parameters and final states of several models . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     common initial parameters of all models are the initial mass of the stellar component , @xmath69 which implies @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the initial half - mass radius varies slightly throughout the models , but is generally @xmath72 .",
    "the gas particles are of mass @xmath73 for models 6 and 10 ; in all other cases @xmath74 is considered . in models 7 and 11 ,",
    "gas particles were removed instantaneously at @xmath75 ; in all other cases , @xmath13 is the time when the repulsive force was switched on .",
    "@xmath76 is the mass segregation index as defined in @xcite .",
    "@xmath77 is the star formation efficiency ; suffix ` c ' stands for constant @xmath78 throughout the whole cluster , while ` v ' means variable @xmath78 ( decreasing outwards ) .",
    "pik s distribution of semi - major axes of the primordial binaries is considered in all models except for # 5 , where we set @xmath79 the canonical model has i d 6 .",
    "the final state of the canonical model presented in the previous section matches basic observables of the onc quite well , in particular its mass and half - mass radius . the mean number of ob stars is somewhat larger than what is observed in the onc , nevertheless , some of the realisations reach @xmath80 .",
    "hence , we consider this model to be a realistic representation of the onc .",
    "we have investigated several tens of different models with different values of the parameters including the index of the initial mass segregation , initial half - mass radius , mass of the cluster , star to gas mass fraction and the time of the gas expulsion .",
    "models whose final state can be considered compatible with the current state of the onc , at least in some of their characteristics , are listed in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "as mentioned above , the canonical model indicates an anticorelation between the final number of the ob stars and the final mass of the runaway - mass star . in fig .",

    "now , each point represents an average over several tens of realisations of the particular model and a @xmath81 anticorelation becomes evident .",
    "we attribute this relation to the fact that both mechanisms of ob star removal , i.e. physical collisions and ejections , are driven by a common underlyig process of close three - body interactions ( see appendix ) .",
    "naturally , their importance grows with increasing stellar density .",
    "hence , the models that stay more compact during the course of their evolution are located in the top - left corner of the graph .",

    "the canonical model is represented with the @xmath83 sign ; full circle stands for the initial state which is common for all models . ]      in most of our models , the gas particles were blown out of the cluster due to a repulsive external force @xmath84 centered on the cluster core .",
    "the strength of the force was set such that the gas particles were accelerated to velocities @xmath85 on the time - scale of @xmath86 .",
    "this approach is the most realistic one , keeping the continuity equation fulfilled , but , at the same time , it is numerically the most expensive .",
    "the alternative method with instantaneous removal of the gas particles at @xmath13 leads to similar results .",
    "the clusters integrated with this method typically result in somewhat lower total mass and larger half - mass radius at the final time .",
    "let us note , for completness , that in the literature , another method that mimics gas removal in numerical models of star clusters is also used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is based on the time - variable smooth external potential that represents the weakening gravitational potential of the gas .",
    "it has been found that the two approaches ( i.e. modelling gas via particles vs. external potential ) lead to nearly indistinguishable results @xcite . in",
    "order to check for a possible bias of our gas particles approach which may stem from two - body relaxational processes , we have integrated two additional models with very low masses for the gas particles . due to the large number of particles in these integrations , we have followed their evolution only up to the time of the gas expulsion , @xmath87 .",

    "still there would be a chance for a detectable accretion provided the secondary star is massive ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "in such a case , its stellar wind may produce short periods of enhanced activity during pericentre passages , but the corresponding luminosity is rather uncertain .",

    "together with the fact that none of our numerical experiments led to @xmath139 , virtually required by the condition of virial equilibrium , this indicates that the large velocity dispersion can be only partly due to the hidden mass of the runaway - mass object .",
    "detailed analysis of our models shows that there are two other reasons for having large velocity dispersion in the core .",
    "first , according to our models , the onc is a post - core - collapse cluster with centrally peaked density .",
    "this leads to a deep gravitational potential well which allows the central velocity dispersion to be larger than what would be expected e.g. for the plummer profile .",

    "[ fig : dispersion ] indicates that the presence of the dark massive body influences remarkably ( i.e. by more than @xmath140 ) the velocity dispersion in a small region of a radius of @xmath141 .",
    "this is in accord with an analytical estimate of the influence radius of the black hole , @xmath142 , which for @xmath143 and @xmath144 gives @xmath145 . due to the small number count of stars in such a small region ,",
    "standard statistical methods do not represent a robust tool for determining the presence of a dark massive body .",
    "nevertheless , having this caution in mind , let us discuss the velocity dispersion of the compact core of the onc , the four trapezium stars . according to the published observational data ( see table  [ tab : trapezium ] ) ,",

    "yet another , and statistically better founded , argument for a hidden massive body comes from comparison of the kinematical state of the trapezium and similar subsystems found in our numerial models .",
    "we have implemented an algorithm similar to that used by @xcite for detection of trapezium - like systems . in particular , for each ob star we determined its three nearest ob neighbours ( either single ob stars , or bound systems containing at least one ob star ) .",
    "the set of stars was considered trapezium - like if all members had the same ob neighbours . in order to obtain a statistically significant sample , we examined the last 20 snapshots ( covering the period from @xmath165 to @xmath166 ) of 100 independet realisations of the canonical model .",
    "we found trapezium - like systems in a third of cluster snapshots .",
    "the mean value of the velocity dispersion of these systems was found to be @xmath167 .",
    "the runaway - mass star was excluded from the search algorithm .",
    "furthermore , we have distinguished systems according to their centre of mass distance to the runaway - mass object . in approximately two thirds of the trapezium - like systems ,",
    "the runaway - mass object was found within a distance smaller than @xmath168 , with @xmath169denoting separations of individual members .",
    "the mean velocity dispersion of the trapezium - like system of this subset was @xmath170 , while it was only @xmath171 for the remainig cases .",
    "finally , let us remark that kinematical evidence of a massive black hole in the onc may also lie in the @xmath2 probability that it is a member of a binary ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : runaway ] ) .",
    "the typical velocity of the secondary star should be @xmath172 , i.e. considerably exceeding the observed central velocity dispersion .",
    "we have carried out extensive modelling of the dynamical evolution of compact young star clusters , aimig to reconstruct the history of the onc .",
    "assuming that the onc underwent primordial gas expulsion , we have shown that the onc must have been several times more compact than it is now in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this implies that its two - body relaxation time was considerably shorter in the past and , consequently , that close few - body interactions between massive stars were rather frequent .",
    "we have concentrated on two significant tracks of such interactions that lead either to high - velocity ejections of massive stars from the cluster or to their physical collisions that are likely to lead to the formation of a massive ` runaway ' merging object .",
    "both of these processes decrease the number of massive stars in the cluster .",
    "hence , the observed significant lack of massive ob stars in the onc further supports our assumption that this star cluster has undergone a relaxation dominated period since its birth .",
    "we have shown that it is not unfeasible that the centre of the onc harbours a black hole of mass @xmath173 as the remnant of the massive runaway - mass star .",
    "its presence could be revealed either by episodic accretion events or by a thorough kinematical study of the innermost @xmath174 region of the onc , where the hidden mass would increase the velocity dispersion above @xmath175 . in particular , we have shown that the observed velocity dispersion of the trapezium system can be achieved by the presence of an object of mass @xmath176 which is fully consistent with the hypothesis of the runaway - mass object .",
    "our model also shows that the apparent super - viriality of the central @xmath177 can be explained as a natural attribute of a post - core - collapse dynamical state of a star cluster with a considerable binary fraction .",
    "the possible detection of the remnant of the merger object could bring new light into several fields of contemporary astrophysics .",
    "first , it would confirm the hypothesis that star clusters similar to the onc are being formed very compact with a half - mass radius of the order of a few tenths of a parsec @xcite .",
    "second , and probably more importantly , it would have important implications for the evolution of very massive stars and merger products for which we have only a limited understanding now .",
