    "we treat a type of heterogeneity that arises naturally in materials , but whose effect on waves has not been studied : crumpled membranes .",
    "the disorder introduced by crumpling is much different from the random disorder usually considered . instead of a structureless disorder , crumpled sheets consist of uniform , flat facets bordered by strongly curved and stretched borders called elastic ridges @xcite .",
    "vibrational waves are expected to propagate much differently in the facets and in the border regions .",
    "crumpled sheets of newsprint paper are commonly used as an insulating and protective enclosure , but we know of no characterization of their vibrational isolation or transmissions properties .    we anticipate various possible effects .",
    "we imagine oscillating a point on the membrane and investigating the response as a function of distance from this source as compared with a flat , uniform sheet .",
    "first , there are two natural regimes of vibrational frequency to be considered .",
    "low frequencies are expected to produce vibrations with wavelengths much longer than the facets or ridges of the crumpled structure .",
    "these long - wavelength waves might show distinctive and subtle features , yet we shall not treat them in the present paper .",
    "these waves are not expected to depend heavily on the distinctive facet - and - ridge structure of crumpled sheets .",
    "we shall consider instead the complementary regime of higher frequencies having wavelengths smaller than the typical facets of the sheet .",
    "several behaviors might be expected as compared to the uniform sheet . on the one hand",
    ", the elastic tension induced by the ridges might enhance the propagation along the network of ridges . on the other hand , the contrasting nature of the ridges and the facets might serve as a barrier for propagation out of or into a facet .",
    "it is these phenomena that we address below .    in section",
    "ii we briefly review classical thin membrane theory and gather the results we need . in section iii we derive the wave equations for transverse waves on a generic curved , strained surface from a langrangian formulation . section iv is devoted to studying the form of the dispersion relations in the two distinct regions ( ridges and facets ) and also the scaling behaviour of the dispersions with thickness of the sheet .",
    "this analysis first suggests the possibility of trapped energy in the facets with ridges serving as barriers . in section v we discuss in detail the simulations we performed and compare them to our analytical predictions .",

    "the eigenvalues of the curvature tensor are simply the inverses of the two principal radii of curvature of the surface .",

    "we now consider the leading order behaviour of the above coefficients in the limit of very small thickness , @xmath26 , where @xmath16 is measured in units of the ridge size .",
    "for this case the scaling of the midridge curvature and strain with thickness have been worked out by witten and coworkers @xcite .",
    "we have the following results for @xmath65    using these scaling laws along with the dispersion relation obtained above gives us the scaling behaviour of the dispersion curve @xmath66 where @xmath67 are positive real numbers independent of @xmath16 .",
    "it is also to be noted that we would get the same form for the dispersion in the perpendicular direction of propagation .",
    "the explicit form of the leading order term in the coefficient @xmath68 is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the transverse radius of curvature of the ridge .",
    "this is significant because the above expression is the square of the `` ringing frequency '' of a cylinder of radius @xmath71 , which is the frequency of purely radial oscillations of the cylinder @xcite .",
    "thus the last term in the dispersion represents the `` breathing mode '' of the ridge .",
    "equation ( 30 ) tells us that , for large wavenumbers ( @xmath72 ) , the first term dominates leading to pure bending wave behaviour .",
    "this is reasonable , since for small wavelengths ( or large @xmath73 ) the surface is locally flat and hence we expect behaviour like bending waves on a flat sheet . in the long wavelength regime ( @xmath74 ) , the constant term dominates leading to breathing modes of the ridge .",
    "this also prescribes a lower cutoff frequency for modes in the ridge .",
    "there is _ no _ regime where the second term describing sound modes dominates .",

    "@xmath75 using these scaling laws , we follow the same procedure as in the last section to obtain the scaling form of the dispersion relation @xmath76 again we see two distinct regimes . for small wavelengths ( @xmath77 )",
    ", we have pure bending waves and for large wavelengths ( @xmath78 ) , we have breathing modes . figure  [ fig : disp ] shows the dispersion curves for both the ridges and facets .",
    "we notice that there are modes that exist on the facets whose frequencies are too low to propagate in the ridges .",
    "this prompts the question as to whether these modes can tunnel through the ridges to the other facets .    .",
    "coefficients independent of @xmath16 ( @xmath79 etc ) have been set to 1 .",
    "the lower @xmath73 cutoff for the ridge region is the inverse of the ridge width ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the lower cutoff for the facet region is the inverse of the ridge length which we take as unity . above @xmath81 bending modes",
    "dominate in the ridge and modes in the facet can exist in the ridge too .",
    ", width=307 ]      to address the question of whether the above mentioned modes are able to penetrate the ridges we look at the skin depth of these modes in the ridge region . for a particular mode",
    "the frequency is the same in both regions ( because of matching at the interface ) . if the frequency is less than the cutoff frequency in the ridge region , as is the case with the modes we are looking at , then there will be an associated skin depth .",
    "this needs to be compared to the width of the ridge to see if these modes are trapped in the facet .",
    "consider a mode of frequency @xmath82 .",
    "in the ridge region we have @xmath83 where @xmath67 are just real , positive numbers independent of @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath82 is just less than the cutoff frequency .",

    "thus we find that @xmath91 this implies that the modes we considered ought to remain trapped in the facet for sufficiently thin sheets . in the next section",
    "we examine the predicted scaling behaviour and the trapping phenomenon numerically .",
    "we model the elastic sheet as a triangular lattice of springs of unstretched length @xmath92 and spring constant @xmath93 following seung and nelson @xcite .",

    "this model has been extensively used to study the static scaling properties of ridges @xcite .",
    "we use it in this paper to study the dynamics of wave propagation by adding a unit mass to every lattice point .",
    "this models the kinetic term in our lagrangian and assigns to the sheet , a mass per unit area .    to produce connected ridges and facets",
    "we construct a very simple shape , namely the regular tetrahedron , by joining the edges of a triangular sheet @xcite . by using a conjugate gradient minimization routine",
    "we get the tetrahedron close to its equlibrium position .",
    "we then add in damping and a small perturbation ( a tap on one of the facets ) and then wait for the system to attain a state of equilibrium .",
    "once equilibrium is attained we now remove the damping and perturb the system ( tapping a few lattice points at the center of a facet by giving the three central particles of the facet equal initial velocities normal to the surface ) so as to generate waves and study their propagation . to measure the energy being carried by the waves we first define an energy that measures the deviation from the equilibrium state .",

    "this energy is conserved up to @xmath106 of its value and hence is a reasonably reliable indicator of the energy associated with deviations .    for large initial perturbations",
    "we may also expect the initiation of in - plane waves . to avoid these waves",
    "we first estimate what initial impulse causes a displacement comparable to the lattice spacing , by assuming that the energy of the impulse is transferred to stretching and bending energy in the region of the tap . for typical values ( @xmath107,@xmath108,@xmath109 )",

    "thus tapping below the threshold strength gives us robust , characteristic curves that are independent of the initial impulse . from here on we consider only simulations where we tap below the threshold .",

    "typical curves are like those in figure  [ fig : taps ] with initial impulse below the threshold . for an initial interval",
    "the energy remains close to 1 .",
    "it then begins to drop off and we see a straight line segment to the curve .",
    "the initial interval simply indicates the time it takes the fastest mode to reach the edge of the facet . the straight line segment on the other hand is presumably where all modes are contributing giving us a constant energy flux out of the facet and hence a constant slope in the energy versus time graph .    to measure these two quantities",
    "we first define an onset time @xmath113 where the energy begins leaking out to the other facets .",
    "we take this as the time for the energy of the perturbed facet to drop to a fraction @xmath114 .",
    "we choose 0.9 because it is close enough to 1 so as to justify the name onset time but still far enough from 1 to get a good spread of data .",
    "we now wish to study how this onset time scales with the thickness of the sheet .",
    "we obtain data for different thicknesses by running the simulation with the parameter @xmath92 kept fixed and changing @xmath115 such that the young s modulus remains constant while the bending modulus obeys @xmath116 .",
    "note that since the unit masses are not changed the density per unit area ( @xmath117 ) remains constant .",
    "the onset time should be proportional to the inverse of the largest group velocity . from figure",

    "the onset time is a characteristic of the velocity of propagation in the facet and we would get an identical scaling law for a flat sheet . to identify the effects of the ridge we consider the portion of the curve that shows the energy leaving the facet . as mentioned before there is a straight line segment to this curve where we may assume all modes are contributing .",
    "we denote the slope of this line segment as @xmath124 and study how this quantity varies with thickness .",
