    "one of the promising approaches utilizes coherent population trapping ( cpt ) resonances : by coherent interaction with two resonant optical fields in a @xmath3 configuration , atoms can be prepared in a non - interacting quantum superposition of two hyperfine ground states ( a `` dark '' state ) , which results in enhanced transmission  @xcite .",
    "the dark state is very sensitive to detuning of the frequency difference of the two optical fields from the hyperfine splitting of the atomic states , which allows using the cpt effect for precision sensing . in recent years",
    "atomic frequency standards based on cpt resonances with fractional frequency stability of 10@xmath4 or better have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "further improvements in stability require realization of cpt resonances with optimized parameters , such as larger amplitude and contrast and smaller linewidth .",
    "in addition , any sensitivities to environmental changes must be minimized . in particular , light shifts ( i.e. , spectra shifts in the transmission peak with total light power )",
    "can limit the frequency stability of cpt - based devices .",

    "miniature atomic clocks typically use a single diode laser ( usually a vertical cavity surface - emitting laser , or vcsel ) phase - modulated at an appropriate frequency to obtain two light fields , required for cpt resonances . as a result ,",
    "practical operational schemes are restricted to light fields of the same polarization . in the case of circularly",
    "polarized light fields , for example , this restriction leads to significant reduction of cpt resonance amplitude , since large fraction of the atomic population becomes trapped in the `` end '' zeeman states with maximum value of the angular momentum ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) , and not in the desired magnetic field - insensitive states with @xmath8  @xcite . to mitigate this problem ,",
    "a variety of cpt schemes  @xcite as well as related coherent resonances  @xcite have been proposed and studied by different groups .    in this paper",
    "we present a cpt interaction scheme that takes advantage of the unique level combination of alkali metal atoms with nuclear spin @xmath9=3/2 to realize high - contrast magneto - insensitive cpt resonances with two optical fields of the same linear polarization ( _ lin_@xmath10_lin _ configuration ) .",
    "this scheme , initially proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is possible when two ground states with total angular momentum @xmath11=1,2 are coupled only through an excited state with total angular momentum @xmath12=1 . in a vapor cell this situation is realized only for the d@xmath0 line of @xmath1rb when the exited - state hyperfine levels are spectrally resolved . here",
    ", we present an experimental and theoretical study of this _ lin_@xmath10_lin _",
    "cpt scheme , and demonstrate the cancellation of the first - order light shift by proper choice of the frequencies and relative intensities of the two optical fields , which can reduce the sensitivity of resonance parameters to laser intensity fluctuations .",
    "observation of cpt resonances requires two optical fields @xmath13}$ ] tuned to two - photon resonance with the hyperfine transition of an appropriate atom : @xmath14 . in @xmath15rb , for example , the hyperfine splitting is @xmath16  ghz . for miniature atomic clock applications ,",
    "both fields are produced by a single phase - modulated laser ( typically a vcsel ) and have the same polarization .",
    "traditional cpt clocks use circularly polarized laser output  @xcite . in this case",
    "the magnetic field - insensitive cpt resonance is formed between @xmath8 zeeman sublevels [ ( 0)-(0 ) clock transition ] .",
    "for example , for @xmath17-polarized laser fields @xmath18 , the corresponding cpt dark state is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the transition matrix elements for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a normalization coefficient .",
    "the disadvantage of such a scheme is the existence of the noninteracting trap state @xmath23 : since it is decoupled from both circularly polarized optical fields , a large portion of the atomic population is optically pumped in the trap state .",
    "this effectively reduces the density of interacting atoms , resulting in lower cpt resonance contrast .",
    "application of linearly ( or in general elliptically ) polarized optical fields can eliminate such trap states .",
    "however , such polarizations simultaneously deteriorate the ground - state coherence formed between two the magnetic field - insensitive sublevels",
    "@xmath24 in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field . in this case , two opposite circularly polarized components of the optical fields simultaneously form two @xmath3-systems between the @xmath24 ground states , through both @xmath25 excited states .",
    "the matrix elements for @xmath26 are equal and opposite @xmath27 , but those for the transitions @xmath28 are the same @xmath29 . as a result , the dark states for each @xmath3 system are different , as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ d_circ ] .",
    "in particular , for linearly polarized light , when the intensities of the two circular components are the same , the ground - state coherence on the ( 0)-(0 ) clock transition disappears completely , since the dark state for one @xmath3 system becomes the bright ( interacting ) state for the other .    @xmath15rb atoms , with the nuclear spin of _",
    "i_=3/2 , offer a unique possibility to form high contrast magneto - insensitive cpt dark resonances using a different combination of zeeman sublevels with arbitrary polarized light fields even for the condition of reduced or zero coherence on the ( 0)-(0 ) clock transition .",
    "possible @xmath30 optical transitions from @xmath31 ground state to the @xmath5 excited state resulting from the interaction of two elliptically polarized optical fields are shown in fig .",
    "solid arrows show two possible two - photon @xmath3 resonances that create atomic coherence between @xmath32=1,_m_=@xmath33 , @xmath32=2,_m_=@xmath34 and between @xmath32=1,_m_=@xmath34 , @xmath32=2,_m_=@xmath33 [ further in the text we refer to these as ( @xmath351)(@xmath361 ) and ( @xmath361)(@xmath351 ) resonances ] .",
    "both of these @xmath3-schemes are excited through a common excited state @xmath37=1,_m_=@xmath38 .",
    "most importantly , the gyromagnetic @xmath39-factors of the two ground - state hyperfine levels in @xmath40 alkali metal atoms have equal absolute value and opposite signs ( neglecting the small contribution of nuclear spin ) .",
    "thus both ground states in each of these @xmath3 systems shift by an equal amount when a weak longitudinal magnetic field is applied . as a result",
    "a cpt resonance occurs at the unshifted `` clock '' frequency @xmath41 via two dark states @xmath42 : @xmath43 here @xmath44 are the transition matrix elements shown in fig.1 , and @xmath45 are normalization constants . in this configuration",
    "there are no `` trap '' states when the zeeman levels are not degenerate . hence under cpt conditions the atomic population accumulats only in the coherent dark states , resulting in higher cpt resonance contrast .",
    "while the states ( [ d_pm ] ) exist for arbitrary elliptical polarizations of the optical fields , a linearly polarized laser output is preferable since the influence of nuclear spin leads to a small difference in the @xmath46-factors for different hyperfine components of the ground state . as a result of this @xmath46-factor difference",
    "the frequencies of the ( @xmath47)(@xmath48 ) and ( @xmath48)(@xmath47 ) two - photon @xmath3-resonances are also different in finite magnetic field ( for @xmath1rb this difference is 2.8 khz / g ) , but their position is symmetric relative to the hyperfine splitting frequency @xmath49 .",
    "thus , for the _ lin_@xmath10_lin _ excitation scheme ,",
    "this small difference in the two - photon resonance frequencies leads only to the broadening of the resonance , but not to a frequency shift ( in linear zeeman effect approximation ) . at stronger magnetic field",
    "the cpt resonances from the two @xmath3 systems become resolvable ; the dip between the two cpt peak may be used as a  pseudo - resonance \" for atomic clocks as well , although its characteristics look less promising  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that if the ground states @xmath32=1,_m_=@xmath50 and @xmath32=2,_m_=@xmath51 are coupled to the excited states @xmath37=2,_m_=@xmath52 , then the dark state given by eq.([d_pm ] ) are degraded  @xcite .",
    "thus , the key requirement to the observation of high - contrast _ lin_@xmath10_lin _ cpt resonances is good spectral resolution of the excited state @xmath12=1 .",
    "the d1 line of @xmath1rb is the most promising candidate for this scheme since its excited state hyperfine splitting ( 812  mhz ) exceeds the doppler broadening at room temperature , allowing its use in vapor cells and hence in miniature atomic clocks . for all other @xmath40 alkali atoms ( @xmath53li , @xmath54na , @xmath55k ) , and also for the d@xmath56 line of @xmath1rb , good spectral resolution of the excited state is possible only in the case of laser cooled atoms or in a collimated atomic beam . even for the @xmath1rb d1 line the realization of a miniature _ lin_@xmath10_lin _ cpt atomic clocks will require careful optimization of the buffer gas pressure to increase the diffusion time of atoms in the laser beam and , hence , the dark state lifetime without severe degradation of the resonance amplitude due to the reduced spectral resolution of the pressure - broadened excited states . in particular",
    ", there is a potential difficulty in using this scheme for chip - scale atomic clocks that typically use very high buffer gas pressures , which broaden the optical resonances beyond the usual doppler linewidth .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented , however , through the addition of an anti - relaxation wall coating to a vapor cells with lower buffer gas pressure  @xcite .",

    "the two - photon detuning between the probe and drive fields was precisely controlled by varying the output frequency of the microwave synthesizer providing the eom modulation signal .",
    "the intensity ratio @xmath60 between probe and drive fields [ sideband / carrier ratio ] was adjusted up to @xmath61 by changing the power of the microwave signal sent to the eom . to achieve higher intensity ratios we used a thermo - stabilized quartz fabry - perot etalon with free spectral range of 20  ghz , finesse of 30 , and maximum transmission of 70@xmath62 , temperature - tuned to partially transmit the strong drive field .",
    "the beam reflected from the etalon contained the unaffected first order sidebands and an attenuated drive field .",
