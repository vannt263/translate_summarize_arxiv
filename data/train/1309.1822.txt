    "there are two classical approaches to the representation theory of the lie algebra @xmath1 .",
    "the first one , known as the theory of highest weight , suggests a parametrization of all complex finite - dimensional irreducible @xmath1-modules by @xmath2-tuples of complex numbers @xmath3 .",
    "these @xmath2-tuples are called weights and describe the action of the cartan subalgebra @xmath4 on the module .",
    "the second approach is based on the schur - weyl duality between the representations of the symmetric group @xmath5 and the lie algebra @xmath1 .",
    "it produces a set of @xmath1-modules called the schur modules , which are certain submodules ( or quotient modules ) of tensor products of the defining @xmath1-module @xmath6 .",
    "let us borrow terminology from the representation theory of the lie group @xmath7 , and call a @xmath1-module polynomial ( respectively rational ) if it is isomorphic to a submodule of @xmath8 ( respectively @xmath9 ) .",
    "then , the schur modules exhaust all the polynomial @xmath1-modules .",
    "similar approaches can be taken towards the representation theory of the yangian @xmath0 . the highest weight theory for yangians",
    "was developed by drinfeld .",
    "let us call two finite - dimensional representations of the algebra @xmath0 similar if they differ by an automorphism of the form .",
    "up to similarity the irreducible finite - dimensional @xmath10-modules were classified in @xcite . due to this classification",
    "every irreducible finite - dimensional @xmath0-module is described by a set of drinfeld polynomials , serving the same goals as weights in the representation theory of @xmath1 .",
    "later on , analogous results on the representations of shifted yangians and @xmath11-algebras were obtained in @xcite .",
    "another approach to the representation theory of @xmath0 was considered in the works @xcite and is based on the @xmath12 howe duality ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main role is played by a certain functor @xmath13 from the category of @xmath14-modules to the category of @xmath0-modules .",
    "this functor appeared as a composition of drinfeld ( see @xcite ) and cherednik ( see @xcite ) functors , and can be regarded as a reformulation of the olshanski centralizer construction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then the following steps were taken in @xcite .",
    "first , the functor @xmath13 was applied to the verma modules of the algebra @xmath14 which gave rise to a series of _ standard _ representations of the yangian @xmath0 .",
    "second , with the help of the theory of zhelobenko operators for mickelsson algebras ( see @xcite ) certain intertwining operators between the standard @xmath0-modules were constructed .",
    "finally , in the works @xcite it was shown that all irreducible finite - dimensional @xmath0-modules considered up to similarity can be obtained as the images of the intertwining operators constructed in @xcite . an analogous result for representations of quantum affine algebras appeared earlier in @xcite .    in analogy with the @xmath1-case ,",
    "let us call a representation of the yangian @xmath0 _ polynomial _ if it is a subquotient of a tensor product of vector representations of @xmath0 .",
    "note that all @xmath0-modules constructed in @xcite are polynomial .",
    "moreover , any polynomial @xmath0-module appears this way .",
    "let us call a representation of the yangian @xmath0 _ rational _ if it is a subquotient of a tensor product of vector and dual vector representations of @xmath0 .",
    "earlier , the irreducible rational representations of @xmath0 associated with skew young diagrams were investigated by nazarov in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we try to generalize the approach of khoroshkin and nazarov in order to obtain rational representations of the algebra @xmath0 .",
    "first , we consider a modification @xmath15 of the functor @xmath13 , based on the @xmath16 howe duality ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "second , we apply the functor @xmath15 to the verma modules of @xmath14 which gives certain _ standard rational _ modules . third , with the help of technique developed for twisted yangians @xmath17 , @xmath18 in @xcite ,",
    "@xcite we construct intertwining operators between obtained tensor products and compute the images of highest - weight vectors under intertwining operators .",
    "next , using the results of @xcite , we observe that ( under some conditions on the parameters of standard rational modules ) the image of the certain intertwining operator is an irreducible rational @xmath0-module .",
    "finally , we state as a conjecture that all irreducible rational @xmath0-modules can be obtained by this construction .",
    "we return to this problem in the forthcoming publication @xcite .",

    "we define the comultiplication @xmath54 by the assignment [ 1.33 ] : t_ij(u)_k=1^n  t_ik(u)t_kj(u ) . throughout the article this comultiplication",
