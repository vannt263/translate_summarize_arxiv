    "reaction - diffusion systems are known to be strongly dependent on fluctuations when the spatial dimension @xmath3 is at or below an upper critical dimension @xmath4 .",
    "this fluctuation - dominated case has been treated by field - theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) methods for a wide variety of reaction types and conditions , as recently reviewed @xcite .",
    "comparison of the rg results with exact solutions and simulations has generally yielded agreement or at least consistency , as detailed in examples given below .",
    "however , simulations of the single - species @xmath5 reactions at the upper critical dimension @xmath6 @xcite appear to be inconsistent with rg predictions @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is noteworthy since these reactions present one of the simplest and directly testable cases . in the current work",
    "we demonstrate that there is no discrepancy .",
    "the general single - species reaction - diffusion decay @xmath7 with integers @xmath8 has an upper critical dimension @xmath9 . above the upper critical dimension the density @xmath10 follows the rate equation , @xmath11 , which gives the asymptotic decay @xmath12 with an amplitude that depends on the nonuniversal rate constant @xmath13 .",
    "below the upper critical dimension particle anti - correlations neglected by the rate equation become relevant , giving rise to a slower decay @xmath14 , with @xmath15 a universal constant dependent only on the reaction type ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and the dimension @xmath3 .",
    "rg methods have been used to show the exponent to be exact @xcite , and to demonstrate the universality of @xmath15 and provide an expansion in powers of @xmath18 for the amplitude @xcite .",
    "the amplitude expansion may be tested by comparison with exact solutions and simulations .",
    "for example , solvable realizations of the @xmath19 model in one dimension give the decay amplitude of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the rg expansion in @xmath21 gives instead @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "evidently the truncated perturbative rg is of little accuracy when @xmath23 .",
    "however , if the diffusive transport is replaced by long - range hops , the upper critical dimension can be continuously lowered from two to one , allowing for a truly small @xmath24 in spatial dimension @xmath25 @xcite . in this case , the theoretical amplitude compares well with simulations . also noteworthy",
    "is that the ratio @xmath26 found from exact solutions @xcite is also an exact result from the rg calculation , i.e. ,  a field rescaling transformation in the field theory shows this ratio to hold to all orders in the @xmath24 expansion @xcite .",
    "thus simulations and exact solutions for @xmath27 are in general agreement with the field - theoretic rg approach .    for the borderline case of @xmath28 , the density is predicted to decay with the rate equation exponent , but with logarithmic corrections and a universal amplitude @xcite , @xmath29 the amplitude in this case is given explicitly , rather than perturbatively , as @xmath30 this explicit result provides then a strong test for the rg calculation .",

    "further , the @xmath45 simulations were found to be consistent with a version of smoluchowski theory adapted for three - particle reactions @xcite .",
    "that is , an approximate theory appears to agree better with the simulations than the rg calculation , which in principle involves no approximations .    to address this discrepancy , we revisit all of the field - theoretic approach , simulations , and smoluchowski theory .",

    "this universal leading correction is quite significant in the time range available to simulations , of the order of half the magnitude of the asymptotic density .",
    "consequently , including this term makes the rg predictions consistent with the previous @xmath45 simulations @xcite but not with the @xmath51 simulations @xcite .",

    "our simulation data is not capable of directly confirming the predicted amplitudes due to remaining , slow transients .",
    "however , the data shows no discrepancy with the rg predictions for all three cases .    in order to have a test of the rg predictions that does not contain slow transients , we turn in section  [ sec : rescaling ] to the field rescaling transformation in the field theory , which we use to predict relations between pure and mixed reactions .",
    "our simulations verify that these relations hold with high accuracy .",
    "finally , we turn to the smoluchowski approach , which is presented in section  [ sec : smoluchowski ] .",
    "we begin by demonstrating that the smoluchowski solution for the @xmath52 reactions in @xmath53 not only exhibits the logarithmic corrections , but also gives the correct density amplitude @xmath54 .",
    "we believe this to be a new result .",
    "this is also germane to the @xmath35 reaction in @xmath6 because both smoluchowski approaches to this problem in the literature @xcite are constructed via a quasi - two - dimensional approach .",

    "the particle current in the pseudo - particle plane is then @xmath206 interestingly , current is directed radially inward despite the anisotropy .",
    "the flux through a circular region encompassing the fixed particle is @xmath207    now we generate an equation for the density @xmath10 of our one - dimensional system . as before , we generate an equation for the density by considering each particle in turn to be fixed at the origin .",
    "this brings a factor of @xmath208 since each reaction removes @xmath209 particles and is counted three times .",
    "furthermore , since each particle pair contributes two pseudo - particles , i.e. , at @xmath176 and @xmath210 , the flux of pseudoparticles to the origin double counts the reactions with the particle at the origin .",
    "the net result is @xmath211 where in the last step we have taken @xmath212 . as with the @xmath2 reactions in @xmath53 ,",
    "this has the rate equation form with a @xmath167 reaction rate .",
    "the resulting density is of the expected form @xmath213 , with the amplitude @xmath87 matching the rg result , eq .",
    "( [ eq : akl ] ) . however , we note that the universal leading corrections predicted by the rg are absent , i.e. , according smoluchowski theory @xmath214 .",
    "our result for the smoluchowski amplitudes differ quantitatively from krapivsky @xcite , who did not consider the anisotropic nature of the diffusion , and from oslb @xcite , who omitted the factor of three due to the number of particles removed in @xmath45 and the factor of @xmath215 due to double - counting the rate of reactions at the origin . with these factors",
    "included , the oslb result becomes equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq:3a_smol ] ) .",
    "the present work was motivated by the apparent discrepancy between the simulations and rg predictions .",
    "this discrepancy was resolved by demonstrating that the densities measured by simulation , which appear to be asymptotic in plots such as fig .",
    "[ fig : combined ] , are in fact consistent with the rg predictions of significant subasymptotic contributions , as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : l0 ] , [ fig : l1 ] , and [ fig : l2 ] .",
    "unfortunately , we also conclude that a more precise test of the rg predictions by direct comparison to simulations is not possible , owing to the slow decay of the higher order terms in a @xmath92 expansion .    in view of this , it is significant that exact solutions are available for the @xmath2 reactions in @xmath32 , which do provide a strong test of the rg results .",
    "it is also significant that relations predicted via the field rescaling transformation between pure and mixed reactions can be tested by simulations and appear to hold with no slow transients . given that these @xmath120 amplitudes are correct , that the field rescaling transformation predictions hold , that there is no discrepancy with simulation in the pure @xmath35 reactions , and that in principle no approximation is made in the rg treatment , it seems reasonable to believe the rg amplitudes reported here are exact results .",
    "as is the usual benefit of an rg calculation , these amplitudes are also demonstrated to be universal , thus the predictions are subject to testing by future exact solutions for any particular realization of the dynamics .",
    "a final result of our study is the demonstration that there is a single smoluchowski theory for the @xmath35 reaction in one dimension , and that this approximate theory indeed yields the exact asymptotic density .",
    "since this property is shared by the @xmath2 reaction in @xmath53 , it appears to be a general feature of smoluchowski theory that it succeeds quantitatively at the upper critical dimension . it may be possible to find an underlying explanation for this property , which would be an interesting direction for future work .",
