    "in 8cb liquid crystals , phase sequence occurs as cry - sm - a - n - i , so for @xmath12 , nematic phase is of the tumbling type in these liquid crystlas .",
    "it is well known that there exists several structures in its nematic regime of 8cb liquid crystals in addition to phase transitions @xcite in particular , the orientation or the isotropic and anisotropic precessional motions of the director around the velocity or the flow gradient directions determines the phases in the nematic regime . from theoretical@xcite,@xcite , and experimental study @xcite of variation of apparent viscosity with shear rate and temperature in 8cb liquid crystals , it was observed that there exists tumbling motions of the director that dominates the whole nematic regime .",
    "these results also showed the periodicity of the tumbling oscillations to be a strong function of temperature .",
    "this tumbling motion in the nematic phase of 8cb liquid crystals was explained more precisely by k.negita et.al.,@xcite .",

    "2)@xmath35 structure : isotropic precession with equal amplitude in the y and z direction @xmath36 .",

    "4)@xmath17 structure : anisotropic precession with its larger amplitude of motion deflected along the z - axis @xmath39 and in the @xmath31 phase , the formation of the layer structure makes the precessional motion impossible .",
    "all the above description of structural regimes involve the elp theory and critical nematodynamics in bulk rheology and x - ray diffraction measurements . in this paper",
    "we present instead a real space in - situ measurement using brownian motion of microsphere .",
    "the diameter of the microsphere is about the same size as that of the structures formed by the orientations of director @xmath2 .",
    "this measurement of brownian motion in tumbling nematic phase is first of its kind .",
    "the microsphere motion among these structures within liquid crystals is in analogy to motion in a harmonic trap , because of the defect formed around the microsphere .",
    "in such a case , the dissipative force describes the average effect on the brownian motion of bead in liquid crystals .",

    "suppose , a fluctuative director@xmath2 displaces the sphere to its left by a distance @xmath50**x * * , this displacement temporarily increases the elastic energy density on the left side .",
    "so , there occurs a difference in the elastic energy densities between left and right side .",
    "this leads to a restoring elastic force f = -k @xmath50**x**/d . here",
    ", @xmath51 is the diameter of the sphere .",
    "this force slows down the diffusion of the microsphere @xcite . if the microsphere moves through structures of the order of diameter of sphere(@xmath52 m ) , then the thermal motion of the sphere is constrained due to these structures .",
    "this leads to an anomalous brownian motion of the microsphere .    in isotropic fluids , the mean square displacement ( msd ) of the brownian motion of a spherical",

    "the elastic torques are normally neglected .",
    "however , on lowering the temperature towards @xmath83 , the shear flow tends to tilt the smectic cluster layers formed .",
    "this changes the layer spacing and gives rise to the restoring force .",
    "we have been able to observe the effect of the tumbling of the nematic director on the elastic and storage modulii , even in absence of an external shear . in other words , the tumbling need not be a be a consequence of external shear on the smectic cluster layers and we propose an alternative explanation .      below @xmath18 regime , tumbling of @xmath2",
    "is mainly because of presmectic translations . here",
    ", the reason for the tumbling effects of director @xmath2 under zero shear conditions can be expected in two ways : 1 ) the molecular layers formed in these presmectic(smectic a ) translations slide freely one over the other resulting in shear effects",
    ". a small flow of molecules along the director orientation and the shear effects among presmectic layers act perpendicular to each other resulting in a superposition of each other .",
    "this superposition leads to tilt the clusters of molecules in the presmectic ( smectic c ) layers . which changes the layer spacing and gives rise to elastic torque @xcite .",
    "2 ) as the temperature decreases , these presmectic layers gets rearranged and hence exists compression on to the central portion of the liquid crystals . because of the quasistaic compression on to the liquid crystal layers in the central portion of the sample cell , this could necessarily affect the equilibrium structure in two different ways . @xmath84",
    "the gap between the layers inside the central portion of the sample cell would either be increased or decreased in order to adopt to the variations of the gap size .",
    "@xmath85 in order to relax from the elastic stress of the layers , the radius of the dislocation loops would be either be increased or decreased@xcite . in simple words , the layers that are close to the wall boundaries , gets rearranged with the changes in temperature . in process ,",
    "the elastic energy density increases between layers . in single particle tracking experiments in liquid crystals ,",
    "the change in elastic energy density between layers and central portion of the cell leads to restoring force on the microsphere .    in liquid crystals ,",
    "the average orientation of liquid crystal molecules is determined by the director @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the effect of collective molecular reorientations on brownian motion of colloids in nematic liquid crystals is determined by the direction of orientation of @xmath2 . in 8cb liquid crystals cell , the parallel and perpendicular orientations to @xmath2 represent y(flow ) and",
    "z(flow gradient ) directions respectively .",
    "as the nematic director does precessional motion to y and z directions , consequently , the thermal motion of the microsphere gets affected or biased by the precessional motion of the director .",
    "hence , in the amplitude and periodicity of the microrheological properties , the effect of the precesional motion of the director @xmath2 is profound .",
    "amplitude and periodicity of @xmath86 in figure [ 8cb g para tumb ] show strong temperature dependence .",
    "these characteristics of @xmath86 are analogus to the apparent viscosity @xmath87 vs shear strain as in a paper by d.f .",

    "this represents , anisotropy in @xmath86 and @xmath88 is clearly a consequence of amplitude of precessional motion of the director @xmath2 being larger in the y - direction than in the z - direction . in @xmath35 regime , @xmath91 .",
    "this is a consequence of isotropic precession of @xmath2 with equal amplitude in both y and z - directions @xmath92 . in @xmath37 regime , @xmath93 .",
    "this is a consequence of anisotropic precession with lesser amplitude in the y - direction than in the z - direction @xmath94 . in @xmath17 regime",
    ", both @xmath86 and @xmath88 does show larger values . here , @xmath95 .",
    "this is in contrast to the anisotropic precession of @xmath2 , with very large amplitude in the z - direction @xmath96 .",
    "this is actually a crossover between values of @xmath86 and @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath17 regime is very close to nematic - smectic transition , smectic layers form temporary clusters . hence , the elastic energy density among these layers increases . since , these temporary smectic layers are in the perpendicular direction(z - axis ) , the difference in the elastic energy density between the central plane(y - axis ) and temporary smectic clusters in the z - axis creates restoring elastic force on the microsphere .",
    "this slows down the diffusive motion of the microsphere along the parallel direction and it results in increasing the elastic or storage modulus @xmath86 .",
    "further , the dependence of elastic modulus @xmath80 on @xmath1 is measured directly by curve fitting .",
    "@xmath97 the above equation [ coupled ] represents sinusoidal distribution of @xmath80 with respect to deformation frequency @xmath1 in @xmath33 and @xmath35 regimes .",
    "the positive and negative slopes in the distribution of @xmath80 indicates the storage and dissipation of elastic modulus .",
    "these positive and negative slopes of @xmath80 are consequence of tilt in the clusters of molecules of pre smectic layers .",
    "this tilt in these clusters of molecules of smectic layers leads to smectic c like clusters locally .",
    "whence with this micro rheology method , discrimination between clusters of presmectic a and clusters of smectic c is identified .    in @xmath37 regime ,",
    "@xmath80 vs @xmath1 followed power law dependence . @xmath98 and @xmath99 also ,",
    "in @xmath17 regime , @xmath100 @xmath101 these equations [ g para in a(b)],[gperp in a(b)],[gpara in ac],[g perp in ac ] show anisotropy in power law dependence of @xmath80 vs @xmath1 in both parallel and perpendicular directions .",
    "this @xmath37 regime is known to be a combination of @xmath19 and @xmath20 orientations of liquid crystal molecules . in @xmath37 regime ,",
    "the power law dependence of @xmath1 in @xmath86 vs @xmath1 is similar to the power law dependence of @xmath102 in @xmath17 regime .",
    "the power law dependence of @xmath102 is similar to power law dependence of @xmath80 vs @xmath1 in @xmath103 phase [ g in b ] .",
    "this shows how the orientation of director is tumbling between y(a - orientation ) and z(b - orientation)directions . in @xmath17 regime , from equation",
    "[ gpara in ac ] represents the precessional motion of amplitude of the director being large to the z direction .",
    "hence the parallel and perpendicular compoents of @xmath80 flip between each other . in both @xmath37 and @xmath17 regimes ,",
    "the reduction in the power of either of the parallel or perpendicular components represent the presence of pre - smectic a clusters of molecules .",
    "since the cell is rubbed for planar alignment and in smectic a clusters , clusters of molecules are generally oriented perpendicular to the layers and these clusters are large enough to restrict the motion of the colloidal particle in the perpendicular direction to the layer plane .",
    "hence , we could conclude only in case of presmectic a clusters , the power of @xmath1 reduces to @xmath104 .",
    "further , in @xmath33 and @xmath35 regimes , @xmath81 vs @xmath1 in parallel and perpendicular directions fits with @xmath105 and in @xmath37 and @xmath17 regimes , @xmath81 follows power law dependence with @xmath1 . in @xmath33 regime , @xmath106    in @xmath35 regime , @xmath107    also , we computed the dynamic viscosity ( @xmath108 ) values from @xmath109 in both parallel and perpendicular directions to the director @xmath2 .",

    "figure[8cb viscosity ] shows that as @xmath17 approaches the smectic region , the thermal motion of the microsphere in the parallel directions(y - direction ) becomes highly restricted by more smectic layer formations .",
    "one can understand this restriction of thermal motion of microsphere as since the cell is rubbed to promote specfic molecular alignment , the larger smectic layer planes in @xmath17 regime are oriented perpendicular to the rubbing direction and are large enough to restrict the thermal motion of microsphere . hence , the self diffusion of the microsphere in the direction perpendicular to the layer plane is lower than in parallel direction as a result @xmath110 can diverge .",
    "as per the elp theory of nemato dynamics , shear flow tilts the orientation of @xmath115 in liquid crystals .",
    "the results of bulk rheology measurements studied earlier in 8cb liquid crystals had always been explained in terms of these tilts @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on lowering the temperature from n - sm - a , the consequences of precessional motion of @xmath2 along different axial directions had been observed . we have established three important phenomenon in 8cb liquid crystals , using particle tracking method .    1 .   using passive microrheology measurements ( zero shear ) , results of tumbling nematic director",

    "physical origin for the tumbling nematics in liquid crystals was therefore redefined for zero shear conditions .",
    "3 .   @xmath0 vs @xmath1 measurements were reported to differentiate pure nematic phase in @xmath103 regime , smectic c like clusters in the presmectics of @xmath33 and @xmath35 regimes and smectic a layers in the presmectics of @xmath37 and @xmath17 regimes .",
