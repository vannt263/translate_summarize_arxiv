    "energy demands have fueled development of so - called shale reservoirs .",
    "this development is two - fold : ( i ) subsurface oil and gas production from mature ( naturally retorted ) oragnic matters ( om ) and ( ii ) near - surface oil and gas generation by artificial retorting of immature om . by tracking maturity through indirect sensing , we can be more conservative in explorative drilling and fracking . similarly , by tracking soil contamination and leakage , during surface retorting or completion of and production from boreholes , energy from shale can be green ( clean and non - toxic ) . despite mature technology to produce hydrocarbon ( hc ) from shales ,",
    "their organic maturity can not be measured without physically extracting a sample .",

    "speaking of @xmath3 , it shows the similar patterns as @xmath2 except frequency dispersion ; all five stages follow sublinear ( @xmath20 , 1@xmath21 ) trends and only v contains a constant part at lower frequencies .",
    "the particular @xmath20-pattern in conductivity has a significance we will discuss later in this section .    in order to correlate these electrical parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , to maturity , key components should be ( 1 ) the properties of kerogen - bitumen - clay ( kbc ) complex , ( 2 ) its interactions with minerals , and ( 3 ) its conversion into polar / non polar hydrocarbons .",

    "kerogen is a complex consisted of decomposed algae buried in fine - grained sediments under anaerobic conditions.@xcite chemical structure of kerogen varies from sample to sample that makes it almost impossible to characterize .",
    "bitumen is defined as a converted organic matter ( om ) which contain the by - products of kerogen .",

    "@xcite demostrates microwave complex dielectric constant of bitumen shifts from low to high depending on oil transformation phases .",
    "it@xcite shows that bitumen has @xmath2 @xmath0 2.6 and @xmath3 @xmath0 0.023 ( @xmath13@xmath14 ) in the oil - generating areas ; in the oil - pyrolyzed gas areas , these can attain very high - values , @xmath2 @xmath0 5 - 15 , and @xmath3 @xmath0 0.85 ( @xmath13@xmath14 ) .",
    "it is reported that thermal metamorphic degree of bitumen is usually small so that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are low .",
    "our results ( table [ table 1 ] ) of dielectric permittivity and conductivity for organic - rich mudrocks in the hc generating phases , are consistent with the data found for the bitumen@xcite(in the same oil - phases ) .",
    "the kbc complex contrubites to dielectric permittivity , @xmath2 of oil - rich mudrocks ; their maturity enhances conductivity , @xmath3 .      from table [ table 1 ] , the dielectric permittivity , @xmath2 at early stage of maturation , ii ,",
    "is reported as 1.9 which is lower than the data previously reported by @xcite ; the ratios of @xmath2 at ii to those at iii , iva and ivb , range @xmath0 1.6 - 1.8 . in ii ,",
    "kerogen porosity is mainly filled by bitumen@xcite ; bitumen is mostly weakly metamorphosed at the early stage of maturation.@xcite for both immature , i , and early maturation stage , ii , bitumens have more normal or isomeric fatty alkanes which have high hydrogen content , i.e . , in our case ii has hi = 584 , highest among all maturation stages ( table [ table 1 ] ) . in the stages , i and ii , the molecules , atoms and electrons in kbc complex are , structurally , bound to each other strongly , making any distortions and orientations difficult in the presence of external electric fields .",
    "therefore , the ability of polarization of bitumens and closely - connected molecules become extremely weak which is a potential reason for low dielectric permittivity at i and ii stages . in terms of structural defects ,",
    "it is reported that weakly metamorphosed bitumen is mostly homogeneous - textured which causes interfacial and orientational polarization of doublet weak in strength due to lack of impurities and vacancies ; this arguments support our results strongly . in an immature stage ,",
    "i , and an early maturation stage , ii , insoluble ( solid ) kerogen component of total organic content ( toc ) , remains yellow - colored ( not being cooked well enough to generate oils yet ) .",
    "the yellow kerogen confirms any contained vitrinite particles have low reflectance,@xcite i.e. , n@xmath22 is low so that @xmath2 shows low value ( as @xmath2 = n@xmath23 for non magnetic materials ) .",
    "@xmath2 display higher values ( @xmath0 1.8 times ) for the maximum maturity stages in the oil - generating windows , i.e. , iii , iva , ivb , compared to the early maturation stage , ii .",
    "we observe a grouping of @xmath2 for iii , iva and ivb , i.e. , @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 1 . @xcite",
    "have shown that between hi = 450 to 150 , basically from iii through ivb , a considerable amount of generated oil remains trapped within the shale .",
    "possibly the variations are due to polar and non - polar hydrocarbons still remaining in the samples .",
    "this study also indicates that an inverse correlation between hi and specific surface area ( ssa ) upto hi @xmath25 130 . at higher hi ( @xmath11 200 )",
    ", ssa remains low .",
    "with solvent extraction , the case with hi @xmath8 130 shows dramatic increase in ssa .",
    "our results point a more complicated picture of interactions among polar / non - polar free radicals , carbon contents , and hi .    in the oil window in an organic source mudrocks ,",
    "the presence of considerable amount of kbc complex obtained ( generated and stored ) .",
    "* the state of kbc complex in iii , iva and ivb , is ready to generate liquid hydrocarbons .",
    "kerogen starts transforming into bitumen or other organic matters , changed coloration to brown which enhances the reflectance of any contained vitrinite particles , i.e. , @xmath2 increases . both polar ( aromatics , saturates , hydrogen - related groups ) and non - polar ( asphaltenes , nitrogen , sulfur , carbon , oxygen - contained compounds ) hydrocarbons consist in kbc complex .",
    "with increasing depth of burial , in other words , with the increasing of maturity , nitrogen ( almost all ) and some of oxygen , hydrogen and carbon deplete .",
    "further thermal cracking converts the kbc complex into petroleum . in the oil generating windows , iii , iva and ivb ,",
    "the polar hydrocarbon increases over non - polar part in the converted hydrocarbons ; bitumen is transitioned to be more carbon - condensed and aromatic as metamorphism proceeds .",
    "the aromatic - formed kbc complex is easy to distort and orient along the applied electric field ; the polarizability develops which causes @xmath2 risen in the oil - expulsion main stages , iii , iva and ivb . in this high",
    "metamorphosed stages , kbc complex becomes heterogeneous ( presence of impurities and vacancies ) in texture makes interfacial and orientational polarization of doublet stronger .",
    "the bundling of @xmath2 in the oil windows , can act as a demarcation line together , to illustrate oil generating feature ; if anyone goes up , one escape oil windows and move to a late or an overmatured stage , or if anyone lies below this line , one resides in early maturation or immature stage .    in a late mature stage , v , kbc complex",
    "is highly metamorphosed and carbon - contained which means hi (= 115 ) goes down .",
    "liquid hydrocarbons ( polar and non - polar ) are condensed into gaseous form ; bitumen is transformed into graphite ( due to over carbon - formation ) and with the highest level of heterogeneity ( full of impurities and vacancies ) .",
    "the graphite typed - bitumen now have high electrical conductivity ( of free electrons ) and both interfacial and orientational polarizations ( of bound electrons ) .",
    "the coloration of kbc complex turn into black and the reflectivity of any contained vitrinites must have reached highest .",
    "therefore , @xmath2 shows the highest value (= 4.9 , see table [ table 1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the late mature stage , v , depends on only graphitization of kbc complex ( due to lack of hydrocarbons ) but in oil - generating stages , iii , iva and ivb , these parameters rely on the conversions of kbc complex into polar / non - polar hydrocarbons .",
    "the conductivity profiles for all stages , from ii through v , are governed by @xmath20-dependence where p @xmath27 1 ; it describes mechanisms as electrical polarization or dielectric relaxation .",
    "this statement is absolutley valid in our perspect because the polarizations due to bound electrons in the kb complex or during the interactions between charged surfaces of clay - site and kbc complex ; eventhough there are few free electrons but suppressed by cumulative dielectric polarizations by the large number of bound electrons and molecules .",
    "the degree of polarization determine the maturity stages .",
    "from table([table 1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath28 = 2.8 , @xmath29 = 1.4 , and @xmath30 @xmath25 @xmath31 1 .",
    "the conductivity dispersion will follow drude - type if polar / non - polar hydrocarbons flow freely , that is definitely not the case here .",
    "eventhough we have liquid hydrocarbons , petroleum , oils ( from kbc complex - metamorphism ) in the main oil - generating stages , iii , iva and ivb , the polar ( free radicals ) hydrocarbons interact with non - polar components , and probably charged surfaces of clay - pores , may create bindings so that they can oscillate and polarize along the sub - thz electrical waves we applied . however there is a chance for a few free electrons to be created and moving but it sould be inappreciable .",
    "the changes in dielectric permittivity , @xmath2 , at different maturity stages are well - supported by their corresponding electrical conductivity , @xmath3 profiles .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath3-data agree upon the grouping in advanced hc generating stages ; this almost constant level emphasizes a threshold of oil - generation during which complex electrical dielectric constant do not change appreciably .",
    "the late mature or overmatured stage , v , contains condensed gas rather than free radicals ( polar / non - polar hydrocarbons ) , and kbc complex is graphitized .",
    "the conductivity displays highest polarization due to free and bound electrons reside in graphites .",
    "the constant segment of @xmath3 at lower frequencies , shows a smooth transition to graphite through carbon aggregation - mechanism .",
    "we speculate , according to fig.([maturity_bk ] ) , three possiblities at and beyond overmatured stage , v : if @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( 1 ) increase , ( polar / non polar ) hc are more generated , ( 2 ) stay level - off , hc are trapped , and ( 3 ) decrease , hc start releasing .",
    "the most significant result we present is that the complex dielectric properties ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) can be strong and reliable candidates of characterizing maturity of organic - rich mudrocks .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3-data emphasize that @xmath2 have constant magnitudes without any dispersion but the lowest value for an early stage of maturation , ii , and gradually go up with higher maturations ; @xmath3 display sublinearilty with frequencies and lowest in magnitude at ii , and increase with maturity stages ( same as @xmath2 ) .",
    "both , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , show the clustering in oil - windows , iii , iva and ivb , and hold the maximums for the overmatured stage , v .",
    "in other words , dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity support each other convincingly .",
    "the grouping in the main hc generationg stages sketches a borderline to point out a threshold level for maximum oil expulsions , i.e. , the presences of polar / non - polar hydrocarbons and their interactions with neighbrong minerals sites and pathways toward more carbon - formations .",
    "our data indicates that the kerogen - bitumen - clay ( kbc ) complex is one of the prime factor to be transformed during maturation .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 of kbc complex in the oil windows * * ? ? ?",
    "* * match exactly our data in the same maturation stages ( iii , iva and ivb ) ; these dielectric parameters stay low in magnitude at immature or early stage of maturation and increase with maturation , supporting the patterns we obtain .",
    "the graphitization of kbc complex at v can also be understood from the complex dielectric characterizations of organic - rich mudrocks .",
