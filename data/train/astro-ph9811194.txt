    "two critical observational advances have taken place in the past two years .",
    "the first is the determination of a diffuse extragalactic fir / smm background ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ; hauser et al .",
    "the second is the detection of faint distant galaxies at fir / smm wavelengths ( kawara et al.1998 ; hughes , et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al .  1998 ) .",
    "hughes et al . , who found no visible or infrared galaxies at the positions of most of the sources they reported in the hubble deep field , suggest that these and much of the smm background originate in distant , dust - shrouded galaxies at red shifts @xmath3 to 4 , undetectable at short wavelengths .",
    "a number of observations argue against such an early origin for most of the diffuse background .",
    "lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have suggested that most ly-@xmath4 absorption systems are progenitors of galaxies , hydrogen rich at high red shifts and rich in stars at low red shifts .",
    "this is supported by rao , turnshek , and briggs ( 1995 ) , who found a drop in gas content by an order of magnitude between @xmath5 , but roughly comparable density parameters , for gas at high red shifts , @xmath6 , and luminous matter ( stars ) seen today , @xmath7 .",
    "pettini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have traced the evolving abundance of zinc in damped ly@xmath4 systems from red shifts @xmath8 .",
    "zinc is a useful tracer of metallicity , since it is not readily deposited from the gaseous phase onto interstellar grains . at red shifts beyond @xmath9",
    "only upper limits could be established , indicating a zinc deficiency @xmath10 .",
    "but even at red shifts @xmath11 the zinc abundance remains a factor of @xmath12 below the solar abundance . at red shifts @xmath13 ,",
    "the abundance of carbon in these systems is roughly a factor of 100 lower than solar , and independent of the optical depth ( songaila & cowie  1996 ; cowie & songaila  1998 ) .",
    "these results do not appear to be seriously affected by dust absorption , since the extinction even for blue light reaches unit optical depth only rarely , at the highest column densities , @xmath14 ( zuo et al . 1997 , songaila et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the cited abundances of heavy elements thus are likely to be reasonable tracers of energy generation in massive and supermassive stars at early epochs",
    ". these metallicities also agree with data for the oldest galactic stars formed at about the same epoch ( timmes et al .",
    "1995 ; cowan et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the general picture that emerges is that the earliest production of heavy elements occurred in population iii stars whose masses were sufficiently high to produce and explosively eject r - process elements .",
    "the metallicity at these epochs was 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than today .",
    "substantial accumulations of heavy elements did not appear until @xmath15 .",
    "sections 2 and 3 , below , respectively summarize the background observations and fir / smm surveys .",
    "section 4 discusses energy generation rates , while section 5 shows why the primary epoch of energy generation must lie in the relatively recent past , at red shifts @xmath16 .",
    "using the far - infrared absolute spectrometer ( firas ) onboard the cosmic microwave explorer satellite ( cobe ) , guideroni , et al .",
    "( 1997 ) estimated a flux at wavelengths between 200 and 400@xmath17 m , of @xmath18nwm@xmath19sr@xmath20 at @xmath21 m , corresponding to a radiation density @xmath22erg @xmath23 .",
    "measurements from the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) aboard the same satellite led hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to a somewhat higher integrated energy from 140 to 240 @xmath17 m , of @xmath24nwm@xmath19sr@xmath20 , or @xmath25 erg @xmath23 .",
    "fixsen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used both dirbe and firas data and found the total fir / smm background from 125@xmath17 m to 2 mm to be slightly higher , @xmath26 erg @xmath23 .",
    "these data represent only a fraction of the total diffuse extragalactic energy density . in the mid - infrared , between @xmath27 and 100@xmath28 m ,",
    "only coarse upper limits are available , all of which are much higher than the fir / smm values . at 3.5@xmath28 m ,",
    "dwek & arendt ( 1998 ) obtain a radiation density of @xmath29 erg@xmath23 from dirbe observations . at 3600 to 22,000 , pozzetti et al  ( 1998 ) have estimated a background flux of @xmath30 erg @xmath23 , from discernable sources in the hubble deep field .",
    "we can write the total extragalactic radiation density , exclusive of the 2.73k microwave background radiation , as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fraction that lies in the fir / smm range",
    ". the upper limit to @xmath33 comes from the uv / optical / near - infrared contribution ; the lower limit comes from uncertainties , comprehensively reviewed by dwek et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and from the implications of the observed tev gamma - ray flux from mrk 501 ( coppi & aharonian 1997 ; stanev & franceschini 1998 ) .",
    "using the infrared space observatory , iso , taniguchi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found 15 sources at 5 to 8.5@xmath28 m , with a total flux of 1mjy , in a @xmath34 field , corresponding to a radiation density of @xmath35erg@xmath23 . at 12 to 18@xmath17",
    "m , altieri et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derived a preliminary density of sources at fluxes above 50@xmath28jy at @xmath36 per square degree , yielding @xmath37erg@xmath23 as well .",
    "kawara et al .",
    "( 1998 ) conducted a deep survey over a 1.1 square degree field at 95 and 175@xmath28 m , respectively , and found 36 and 45 sources , all brighter than 150mjy .",
    "the corresponding radiation density in this @xmath38m - wide band at 120@xmath28 m is @xmath39erg @xmath23 .    at 850@xmath28 m two deep surveys",
    "have been undertaken , both using the scuba array on the james clerk maxwell telescope in hawaii .",
    "hughes et al .  ( 1998 ) reported five sources in a 5.6 square arc minute field for a total flux of 20mjy , or @xmath40wm @xmath41sr@xmath20 , while barger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have found two sources with a combined flux of 8 mjy in two such fields of view .",
    "the respective energy densities at 850@xmath17 m are @xmath42 and @xmath43erg@xmath23 .",
    "madau et al .  ( 1998 ) have made a persuasive case for estimating early star formation and energy generation rates , on the basis of luminosity of distant sources in the 0.15 to 2.2 @xmath17 m wavelength band .",
    "the top curve in figure 1 shows their derived energy generation rates as a function of red shift .",
    "this approach is complementary to estimates of energy generation rates based on observed metallicities ( fall et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "directly detected metallicity can underestimate the true heavy element and energy production .",
    "the fraction of processed material ejected from stars , @xmath44 , and the energy per unit mass , @xmath45 , generated in the process are only part of the story .",
    "we need to also consider the fraction of all baryonic mass , @xmath46 , which has radiated away energy in producing heavy elements retained in the interior of stars .",
    "white dwarfs constitute a fraction @xmath47 of the mass of all stars .",
    "vassiliadis and wood  ( 1993 ,  1994 ) have traced the evolution of stars with initial masses ranging from 0.89 to 5 m@xmath48 , and find that the ejected mass contains hardly any elements heavier than helium , that the helium content of the ejected gas is only a few percent higher than the initial fraction , but that the final core masses of processed material range from @xmath49m@xmath48 for stars at the high end of the range . we may , therefore , approximate the energy that was generated per unit white dwarf mass as a fraction @xmath50 of the star s current mass .",
    "neutron stars constitute a fraction @xmath51 of all stellar mass , and have also converted a fraction @xmath52 of this mass into energy . the neutron star s rotational energy immediately after collapse into a body spinning with a millisecond period is also of order @xmath53 of the mass - energy .",
    "this is eventually dissipated and radiated away . a typical neutron star with mass @xmath54m@xmath48 ,",
    "thus will radiate away a fractional amount of energy per unit mass @xmath55 .",
    "the supernova explosion accompanying the formation of a neutron star provides the heavy elements and much of the non - primordial helium observed in stellar atmospheres and the interstellar medium .",
    "chieffi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have recently compared estimates by various authors , of the total mass of heavy - element ejecta from supernovae , as contrasted to mass retained in the core . for a star whose",
    "initial mass was 25m@xmath48 the current consensus appears to favor ejection of a mass of approximately 4m@xmath48 in carbon , oxygen , neon , magnesium and silicon .",
    "in addition , the star also yields 9m@xmath48 of @xmath56he , and a core mass of iron m@xmath57m@xmath48 .",
    "consistent with the ratio of heavier elements to helium in supernova ejecta and stellar winds , we find that heavy elements constitute about 2% of the sun s mass , and that the sun s helium content is roughly 30% by mass , about 6% higher than the primordial helium abundance",
    ". the ratio of heavy elements ejected to those retained in neutron stars is also consistent with an overall neutron star complement amounting to @xmath581% of all stellar mass .",
    "we write @xmath59 , respectively determined by solar heavy - element abundance and nuclear plus kinetic energies released in supernova explosions .",
    "stellar mass black holes may radiate away an amount of energy comparable to neutron stars , but they appear to be rare , and probably do not contribute greatly to the overall electromagnetic energy constituting the extragalactic background . neither the fractional mass in black holes at the centers of galaxies , nor the efficiency with which they have radiated away electromagnetic energy are currently well established , but their contribution to the metallicity and electromagnetic background appears to be modest .",
    "finally , we need to also consider the class of low - mass stars that have never reached the white dwarf stage , but have nevertheless contributed to the radiation density , though not to the observed metallicity .",
    "their fraction by mass , @xmath60 , depends on the stellar birth rate function .",
    "these different sources of energy suggest three separate estimates of contributions to the extragalactic background .",
    "the first is for a single burst , at red shift @xmath61 , of rapidly evolving , massive , primordial , population iii objects with a fractional mass @xmath62 .",
    "the second is for a continuous generation of massive stars that evolve primarily into neutron stars and white dwarfs . here , the rate of formation at epoch @xmath61 is @xmath63 , which needs to be integrated over the appropriate red - shift interval @xmath64 .",
    "the last is for low - mass stars that may have formed at early times and have continued to shine at roughly constant luminosity for most of the history of the universe .",
    "these cases are then confronted with current data .",
    "the contribution to the radiation field by massive stars can be estimated from the dependence of the observed metallicity @xmath65 on red shift @xmath61 .",
    "to lowest order , the data cited in section 1 are consistent with a systematic metallicity decline by a factor of 10 for increasing red - shift intervals @xmath66 @xmath67      at epoch @xmath61 , the baryonic mass density @xmath68 in a flat universe with deceleration parameter @xmath69 is @xmath70 here , @xmath71 is the baryon density parameter , @xmath72 is the hubble constant today , and @xmath73 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the fraction of mass that has been converted into heavy elements by epoch @xmath61 , and the energy generated in this process is given by the stars that complete their evolution on time scales short compared to the age of the universe and end up as supernova ejecta , neutron stars or black holes .",
    "we may approximate this by @xmath74 , where the value @xmath75 is based on a solar abundance of heavy elements of @xmath76 , non - primordial helium of @xmath77 , and the complement of neutron stars that currently constitute roughly 1% of baryonic mass . combining the nuclear and kinetic energies cited in section 4",
    ", we may take @xmath78 .",
    "if all population iii objects were formed in a single burst at epoch @xmath61 , the metallicity of equation ( 2 ) and the corresponding radiation density @xmath79 observed today would be related by @xmath80 or @xmath81 comparison to equation ( 1 ) shows that a single burst , even as late as @xmath3 , fails to provide the requisite energy density for a value of @xmath71 as high as @xmath82 .      for continuous formation of massive stars from the earliest epochs",
    ", we note that the energy production rate is just the derivative of @xmath46 @xmath83 here @xmath84 , takes into account that roughly 10% of the baryonic mass is in white dwarfs , and assumes that the birth rate function @xmath85 does not greatly change over the ons . integrating from @xmath86 to the present , we have @xmath87 this value is consistent with the observed background radiation even for @xmath71 as low as @xmath88 , provided the fir / smm background is a fraction @xmath89 of the total .",
    "since the metallicity rises sharply , all but @xmath90 of the light contributed to the background is of relatively recent origin , @xmath91 .      for low - mass stars ,",
    "we simplify the calculation by assuming that they all have mass @xmath92 , were formed at a single epoch , and have steadily radiated at constant luminosity , ever since . taking a birth rate function @xmath93 and a luminosity proportional to @xmath94 , we find the mean luminosity for stars of mass @xmath95 to be @xmath96 . if a fraction @xmath97 of all the baryons is in low mass stars , the generated radiation energy density increases at a rate @xmath98 , scaled down by the red shift .",
    "@xmath99 where @xmath100 is today s baryon density and the age of the universe at any given time is @xmath101 .",
    "stars that have been steadily shining since @xmath102 contribute @xmath103 to today s radiation density .",
    "this is significantly lower than the observed background .",
    "finally , consider the observational star formation and energy generation rate given by madau et al .",
    "the top curve of figure 1 shows their data for the uv energy generation rate in a comoving volume of 1 mpc@xmath104 in units of erg hz@xmath20 s@xmath20 on the left - hand scale . for the flat cosmological model with @xmath105 that they assume",
    ", the figure also shows the corresponding energy generation rate per unit red - shift interval in units of erg hz@xmath20 z@xmath20 shown on the right . because time intervals @xmath106 corresponding to unit red - shift intervals , @xmath107 , diminish in proportion to @xmath108 , this curve rapidly drops with increasing @xmath61 .",
    "the red shift further lowers the contribution to the background by @xmath109 , for a cumulative reduction by @xmath110 . the integrated contribution to the background is @xmath111nwm@xmath41sr@xmath20 for an assumed uv / optical bandwidth @xmath112hz at the source .",
    "recent suggestions that dust absorption in early galaxies would raise the data at high red shifts , to flatten the curve beyond the peak at @xmath113 ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; pascarelle et al .",
    "1998 ) hardly change estimates of the background radiation received today . whatever the energy production rate at early times may be , the epochs at high red shifts do not last long , lead to an energy drain on the photons , and contribute little to the total energy density . however , for @xmath84 , a high , massive - star - formation rate at early epochs would require an increase in @xmath71 to keep the neucleosynthetic helium and heavier element abundances from exceeding their observed values",
    "the fir / smm extragalactic radiation density is most readily understood in terms of energy generated by massive stars radiating primarily at recent epochs @xmath114 .",
    "conversely , for currently estimated baryon densities , massive stars at high red shifts could not have generated the high levels of diffuse infrared background radiation observed with cobe .",
    "almost any star formation rate consistent with metallicities observed at different red shifts @xmath61 leads to the same conclusion .",
    "energy generation rates could have been high at early epochs @xmath115 , but the duration of such epochs is always brief except in inflationary lematre universes , not considered here .",
